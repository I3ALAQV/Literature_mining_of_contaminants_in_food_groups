35267361,"Consumption of tree nuts and peanuts has considerably increased over the last decades due to their nutritional composition and the content of beneficial compounds. On the other hand, such widespread consumption worldwide has also generated a growing incidence of allergy in the sensitive population. Allergy to nuts and peanuts represents a global relevant problem, especially due to the risk of the ingestion of hidden allergens as a result of cross-contamination between production lines at industrial level occurring during food manufacturing. The present review provides insights on peanuts, almonds, and four nut allergens-namely hazelnuts, walnuts, cashew, and pistachios-that are likely to cross-contaminate different food commodities. The paper aims at covering both the biochemical aspect linked to the identified allergenic proteins for each allergen category and the different methodological approaches developed for allergens detection and identification. Attention has been also paid to mass spectrometry methods and to current efforts of the scientific community to identify a harmonized approach for allergens quantification through the detection of allergen markers.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Tree Nuts and Peanuts as a Source of Beneficial Compounds and a Threat for Allergic Consumers: Overview on Methods for Their Detection in Complex Food Products.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35267361,2022
35231713,"Extensive cross-allergic reactivity exists among food-borne plants. As most allergens are glycoproteins, protein sensitization has been extensively studied. However, little attention has been given to the glycan component of glycoproteins. Here, we qualitatively and quantitatively compared the N-glycans of eight cross-reactive plant glycoproteins derived from peach pollen, soy, pine nut, cashew nut, pistachio, walnut, almond, and hazelnut. Cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) were widely present in the allergic glycoproteins according to the following order: pollen > soybean > pistachios > pine nuts > walnuts > cashews > hazelnuts > almonds. The N-glycan structure presented clear differences between the germplasm and vegetative tissue. Importantly, fucosylation and xylosylation levels correlated positively with extensive cross-reactivity between plants, which suggests that CCDs may be one of the causes of cross-allergy. This result provides the foundation for mechanistic studies on plant-derived CCDs as a source of food cross-allergies.",Food chemistry,"['D000485', 'D031021', 'D031211', 'D003429', 'D006023', 'D031324', 'D013058', 'D021184', 'D009754', 'D027927', 'D011134', 'D000068181']","['Allergens', 'Anacardium', 'Corylus', 'Cross Reactions', 'Glycoproteins', 'Juglans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Nut Hypersensitivity', 'Nuts', 'Pistacia', 'Polysaccharides', 'Prunus dulcis']",Comparative mass spectrometry analysis of N-glycans from the glycoproteins of eight allergy-inducing plants.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35231713,2022
35205208,"The aim of the present study was to investigate how individual phenolic compounds and phenolic groups in walnut husk gratings (e.g., naphthoquinones, flavanols, flavonols, hydroxycinnamic acids) are oxidized over time, with a particular focus on the juglone synthase pathway. Walnut husk gratings were prepared and left under 'degradation' conditions (exposure to the air, room temperature) at increasing times. Following methanol extraction of these husk gratings, the HPLC profile of methanolic extract of husk gratings exhibited twenty-six compounds over time, then hydrojuglone glucoside, α-hydrojuglone, and juglone were detailed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. Initially (0-20 min), the content of hydrojuglone glucoside in the husk gratings decreased by 40.4%, while the content of α-hydrojuglone increased by 20.0%, and then decreased. After an initial delay (0-20 min), juglone increased by 47.9% from 20 to 40 min, and then decreased. This initially confirmed that hydrojuglone glucoside and α-hydrojuglone could be considered as precursors of juglone. Different phenolic groups showed different degradation processes, although they all reached their highest content after 40 min. This might arise from degradation of the phenols, increased free phenols, or activation of the plant defense mechanism due to damage to the tissue, similar to the effects of stress or a pathogen attack. Although it has been reported that the phenolic compounds decrease when food is processed or damaged, they showed increases, which were not indefinite, but time dependent. As phenolic compounds are considered highly beneficial to human health, increases upon processing indicate the need for further investigations into healthier food preparation processes. This is the first study on the degradation pathways of juglone, using a mass spectrometer, in which we suggest that hydrojuglone glucoside and α-hydrojuglone are indeed the precursors of juglone. However, it is possible that there are other degradation pathways of hydrojuglone glucoside, since less juglone is synthesized than expected.",Biology,[],[],Time-Dependent Degradation of Naphthoquinones and Phenolic Compounds in Walnut Husks.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35205208,2022
35011025,"In recent years, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide has become a research hotspot because of its essential role in maintaining human blood pressure balance. In this study, two novel ACE inhibitory peptides of Val-Glu-Arg-Gly-Arg-Arg-lle-Thr-Ser-Val (Valine-Glutamate-Arginine-Glycine-Arginine-Arginine-Isoleucine-Threonine-Serine-Valine, VERGRRITSV) and Phe-Val-Ile-Glu-Pro-Asn-Ile-Thr-Pro-Ala (Phenylalanine-Valine-Isoleucine-Glutamate-Proline-Asparagine-Isoleucine-Threonine-Proline-Alanine, FVIEPNITPA) were isolated and purified from defatted walnut meal hydrolysates through a series of preparation processes including ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-15 gel chromatography, and reverse high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Both peptides showed high ACE inhibitory activities. The molecular docking study revealed that VERGRRITSV and FVIEPNITPA were primarily attributed to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds with the active pockets of ACE. The binding free energies of VERGRRITSV and FVIEPNITPA with ACE were -14.99 and -14.69 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, these ACE inhibitory peptides showed good stability against gastrointestinal enzymes digestion and common food processing conditions (e.g., temperature and pH, sugar, and salt treatments). Furthermore, animal experiment results indicated that the administration of VERGRRITSV or FVIEPNITPA exhibited antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

Fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) is a novel lipid class that was discovered as an endogenous lipid; FAHFAs have shown anti-diabetic effects in a mammalian system. We analyzed the overall FAHFA composition in nut oils and other common oils: almond (raw, roasted), walnut, peanut, olive, palm, soybean, and rapeseed oils. We developed a method of liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) for a comprehensive target analysis of FAHFAs. The analysis revealed wide variation in the FAHFA profiles (15 compounds and 62 peaks). For 7-11 compounds of FAHFA, a total level of 8-29 pmol/mg oil was detected in nuts oils; for 11 compounds, 4.9 pmol/mg oil was detected in olive oil, and for 4-9 compounds, < 2 pmol/mg oil was detected in palm, soy, and rapeseed oils. The major FAHFAs were FAHFA 36:3, FAHFA 36:2, and FAHFA 36:4 in nut oil, FAHFA 36:2, FAHFA 34:1, and FAHFA 36:1 in olive oil, and FAHFA 32:1, FAHFA 34:0, FAHFA 36:0, and FAHFA 36:1 in all of the common oils. The composition of FAHFAs in nut oils is mainly unsaturated fatty acids, whereas those in olive oil are unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. The composition of FAHFAs in common oils was mainly saturated fats. This is the first report to demonstrate the quality and quantity of the FAHFAs in the nut oils.

In this research, we measured the content of As, Cd, Pb and Hg in a wide variety of edible nuts. To determine the As content, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was applied. Cd and Pb were detected by the electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry analytical technique (ETAAS) with Zeeman background correction, while atomic absorption spectrometry method (AAS) with the amalgamation technique in the case of Hg was used. The study material consisted of 120 samples without replications (10 for each subgroup) including the following nuts: Almonds, Brazil nuts, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, pecan nuts, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts. Indicators such as the target hazard quotient (THQ), cancer risk (CR) and hazard index (HI) were used to assess the health risk. The highest median As, Cd, Pb and Hg contents were observed for pistachios (192.42 µg/kg), pine nuts (238.40 µg/kg), peanuts (82.06 µg/kg) and pecans (82.06 µg/kg), respectively. The exceedance of the established limits was found in the case of Pb for nine samples: macadamia nuts (221.49 µg/kg; 2350.94 µg/kg; 2581.43 µg/kg), pine nuts (266.33 µg/kg), peanuts (1353.80 µg/kg) and pecans (2689.13 µg/kg, 2758.26 µg/kg, 2992.29 µg/kg and 3169.41 µg/kg). Extremely high (>2500 µg/kg) Pb content was found in 33% of studied pecans imported from the USA. The health risk indicators did not identify increased health risk. This research is significant considering the food safety issues and indicates the need to regularly control the content of toxic elements in food, as well as to establish the specific limits for heavy metals content in nuts. The chemometric analysis included cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Cluster analysis made it possible to distinguish four subgroups on the basis of the ability to accumulate toxic elements: pine nuts, pecans, pistachios and other analysed nuts. PCA indicated primarily factor 1, distinguishing mainly pecans, macadamia nuts and peanuts.

Female NMRI mice were fed a 6% walnut diet starting at an age of 12 months for 24 weeks. One group was additionally maintained in an enriched environment, one group without intervention served as control. After three months, one additional control group of young mice (3 weeks old) was introduced. Motor and cognitive functions were measured using Open Field, Y-Maze, Rotarod and Passive Avoidance tests. Lipid metabolite profiles were determined using RP-LC-ESI(-)-MS/MS in brain and liver tissues of mice. Cerebral mitochondrial function was characterized by the determination of ATP levels, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial respiration. Expression of genes involved with mito- and neurogenesis, inflammation, and synaptic plasticity were determined using qRT-PCR. A 6% walnut-enriched diet alone improved spatial memory in a Y-Maze alternation test (p < 0.05) in mice. Additional physical enrichment enhanced the significance, although the overall benefit was virtually identical. Instead, physical enrichment improved motor performance in a Rotarod experiment (p* < 0.05) which was unaffected by walnuts alone. Bioactive oxylipins like hydroxy-polyunsaturated fatty acids (OH-PUFA) derived from linoleic acid (LA) were significantly increased in brain (p** < 0.01) and liver (p*** < 0.0001) compared to control mice, while OH-PUFA of α-linolenic acid (ALA) could only be detected in the brains of mice fed with walnuts. In the brain, walnuts combined with physical activity reduced arachidonic acid (ARA)-based oxylipin levels (p < 0.05). Effects of walnut lipids were not linked to mitochondrial function, as ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial respiration were unaffected. Furthermore, common markers for synaptic plasticity and neuronal growth, key genes in the regulation of cytoprotective response to oxidative stress and neuronal growth were unaffected. Taken together, walnuts change the oxylipin profile in liver and brain, which could have beneficial effects for healthy ageing, an effect that can be further enhanced with an active lifestyle.

Thus, the multi-elemental profiles of 237 walnut samples from ten countries and three years of harvest were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and the resulting element profiles were evaluated with chemometrics. Using support vector machine (SVM) for classification, validated by stratified nested cross validation, a prediction accuracy of 73% could be achieved. Leave-one-out cross validation was also applied for comparison and led to less satisfactory results because of the higher variations in sensitivity for distinct classes. Prediction was still possible using only elemental ratios instead of the absolute element concentrations; consequently, a drying step is not mandatory. In addition, the isotopolomics approach provided the classification of walnut samples on a regional level in France, Germany, and Italy, with accuracies of 91%, 77%, and 94%, respectively. The ratio of the model's accuracy to a random sample distribution was calculated, providing a new parameter with which to evaluate and compare the performance of classification models.

In summer 2011, two trap adhesives were tested for potential repellency against P. juglandis in a field trapping bioassay. SuperQ extracts of volatiles from the most repellent adhesive were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and limonene and α-pinene were identified as predominant components. In field-based, trapping experiments both enantiomers of limonene at a release rate of ~700 mg/d conferred 91-99% reduction in trap catches of P. juglandis to pheromone-baited traps. (+)- and (‒)-α-Pinene reduced trap catch by 40 and 53%, respectively, at the highest release rate tested. While a combination of R-(+)-limonene and (+)-α-pinene resulted in a 97% reduction in the number of P. juglandis caught, the combination did not consistently result in greater flight trap catch reduction than individual limonene enantiomers.

Peptides similar to the 13cp in PN and TN allergens bound IgE from sera of patients allergic to PN and TN in peptide microarray analysis. The 13cp was used to produce a rabbit consensus peptide antibody (cpAB) that detected proteins containing repeats similar to the 13cp in western blots of various nut extracts, in which reactive proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The cpAB bound more specifically to allergens and nut extracts containing multiple repeats similar to the 13 cp, such as almond (Pru du 6), peanut (Ara h 2) and walnut (Jug r 2). IgE binding to various nut extracts is inhibited by recombinant J2LS sequence and synthetic 31cp. Thus, several repeated sequences similar to the 13cp are bound by IgE.

The defense response proteins accounted for 24% of the total peptide abundance. The vicilin-like macadamia antimicrobial peptides 2-3 (MiAMP2) was the most abundant protein, followed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3, 11S legumin-like protein, 2-phospho-D-glycerate hydrolase and heat shock 70 kDa protein among others.

A bilayer system was assembled in situ into a thermocompression unit through a two-step procedure. One of the layers was obtained by a casting process and consisted of a chitosan-based nanocomposite functionalized with gallic acid (GA); the other was shaped by the spreading of polyvinyl alcohol solution on the nanocomposite. Then, a stage of thermocompression formed the bilayer system. In this way, a feasible material with water vapor and oxygen barrier as well as UV barrier properties due to the presence of GA was designed by a thermocompression process which can be industrially scaled representing a technological progress. The formation of the bilayers was corroborated by SEM allowing discerning between both, the PVA layer and the nanocomposite layer. On the other hand, the corroboration of interactions between the layers of the system was carried out through ATR-FTIR and DSC analysis. The system was used as packaging of a food susceptible to undergo oxidation such as walnut flour, generating a delay in the formation of hydroperoxides and secondary oxidation compounds compared with a synthetic container.

The gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) technique has been used as a rapid and convenient tool for the identification of physiologically active components from plants. Here, we describe a practical method for electrophysiologically recording from lamellated antenna of scarab beetles. This method enables direct electroantennogram (EAG) recordings from antennal club without damage to the antenna in a similar manner to the conventional cut-tip EAG recording technique for clavate antenna. The headspace volatiles from walnut (Juglans regia L.) trees were collected with a Poropak-Q trap at dusk and then analyzed with GC-EAD. Those volatile compounds that elicited electrophysiological responses on the antennae of a scarab beetle, Metabolus flavescens Brenske (Coleoptera: Scarabeidae: Melolonthinae) were determined by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The lamella directly connected to the recording electrode was held apart from the other two lamellae on the antenna with a minuten pin and a disposable syringe needle. In order to improve electrical contact, a surfactant, Tween® 80, was used to lower the surface tension of Beadle-Ephrussi Ringer solution. This study demonstrated that addition of 0.05% Tween® 80 to the Beadle-Ephrussi Ringer solution suppressed baseline noise and assured significantly greater EAG response in general.

30088215,"A tremorgenic syndrome occurs in dogs following ingestion of moldy walnuts, and Penicillium crustosum has been implicated as the offending fungus. This is the first report of suspected moldy walnut toxicosis in man. An adult male ingested approximately eight fungal-infected walnut kernels and after 12 h experienced tremors, generalized pain, incoordination, confusion, anxiety, and diaphoresis. Following symptomatic and supportive treatment at a local hospital, the man made an uneventful recovery. A batch of walnuts (approximately 20) was submitted for mycological culturing and identification as well as for mycotoxin analysis. Penicillium crustosum Thom was the most abundant fungus present on walnut samples, often occurring as monocultures on isolation plates. Identifications were confirmed with DNA sequences. The kernels and shells of the moldy walnuts as well as P. crustosum isolates plated on yeast extract sucrose (YES) and Czapek yeast autolysate (CYA) agars and incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 7 days were screened for tremorgenic mycotoxins and known P. crustosum metabolites using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method. A relatively low penitrem A concentration of only 1.9 ng/g was detected on the walnut kernels when compared to roquefortine C concentrations of 21.7 μg/g. A similar result was obtained from P. crustosum isolates cultured on YES and CYA, with penitrem A concentrations much lower (0.6-6.4 μg per g mycelium/agar) compared to roquefortine C concentrations (172-1225 μg/g).

29031299,"Starting with an experiment to authenticate walnut oils based on GC-MS analysis of the volatolome, this paper aims to demonstrate the relevance of a two-step alignment-based strategy for the systematic research of VOC markers. The first step of the treatment consists of roughly reducing the time shifts with efficient, known warping techniques like COW (Correlation Optimized Warping). The second step relies on an accurate peak apex alignment in order to refine residual local misalignments and to enable further systematic marker research through univariate or multivariate data treatments. This two-step strategy was implemented on 117 GC-MS analyses of the volatolome of three vegetable oils with very similar composition. During the analysis campaign, the GC-MS system was intentionally subjected to instrumental drifts in order to generate realistic signal shifts. The first part of this study aims to assess the efficiency of the warping-based strategy in terms of signal alignment and sample discrimination. Whereas no distinction between the three oils was possible with unaligned raw GC-MS data, the application of COW enabled a significant but insufficient improvement of both reduction of temporal drifts and between-group separation with 79% of samples being well-classified according to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Applying the peak apex alignment procedure to COW-treated signals resulted in a suitable correction of the remaining local distortions and improved the proportion of well-classified samples in LDA to 100%. The second part of this study assesses the robustness of the discriminant markers highlighted in this approach by: (i) discussing the relevance of the best markers involved in the LDA model, where a close review of literature confirmed the consistency for two of them, and (ii) validating highlighted makers by retrieving the set of the 23 markers previously determined by manual processing among those automatically found. The third part shows the potential of the systematic approach for untargeted detection of 184 highly significant relevant markers from the oil volatolome.

The current study was aimed to determine the total phenolic, flavonoid, and tannin content of Persian wal hull extract and evaluate its biological effects on platelet function. Experimental data showed that acetone extract of wal hulls has a high content of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant properties. The analytical study of crude extract by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated different types of high- and low-molecular-weight compounds that are basically and biologically important. Moreover, an in vitro study revealed that wal hull extract at a concentration of 50 μg/mL inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and protein secretion by 50%, without any cytotoxic effects on platelets. The examined extract suppressed reactive oxygen species generation and also caspase activation in thrombin-stimulated platelets. Identically, N-acetylcysteine inhibited the increase of reactive oxygen species level induced by thrombin in platelets, and supported a link between cellular redox status and caspase activation in activated platelets. Presumably, the antiplatelet activity of wal hull extract is related to its polyphenolic compounds and their antioxidant properties.

Flavonol quercetin is the main representant of these compounds that has been identified in numerous Juglans spp. In this survey, the developmental expression patterns of PAL and C4H genes during in vitro rooting of two walnut cultivars 'Sunland' and 'Howard' was examined by RT-PCR. To understand the potential role in rooting, the changing pattern of endogenous content of quercetin was also analyzed by HPLC. The 'Sunland' with better capacity to root had more quercetin content during the ""inductive phase"" of rooting than 'Howard'. In each cultivar, the level of PAL transcripts showed the same behavior with the changing patterns of quercetin during root formation of microshoots. The positive correlation between the changes of quercetin and PAL-mRNA indicated that PAL gene may have an immediate effect on flavonoid pathway metabolites including quercetin. Although the behavioral change of C4H expression was similar in both cultivars during root formation (with significantly more level for 'Howard'), it was not coincide with the changes of quercerin concentrations.

Objective This study optimizes ultrasound assisted hydroalcoholic extraction (UAE) of phenolic compounds from dried walnut leaves by the maximization of total phenolics content (TPC) and total flavanoids content (TFC) of the extracts. Materials and methods Optimal conditions with regard to ethanol concentration (X1: 12.17-95.83% v/v), extraction time (X2: 8.17-91.83 min) and liquid-to-solid ratio (X3: 4.96-25.04 v/w) were identified using central composite design combined with response surface methodology. A high-performance liquid chromatography method with diode-array detection was used to quantify phenolic acids (gallic, vanillic, chlorogenic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, salicylic, ellagic and trans-cinnamic), flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, rutin, myricetin and quercetin) and juglone in the extracts. Results Liquid-to-solid ratio and ethanol concentration proved to be the primary factors affecting the extraction efficiency. The maximum predicted TPC, under the optimized conditions (61% ethanol concentration, 51.28 min extraction time and 4.96 v/w liquid-to-solid ratio) was 10125.4 mg gallic acid equivalents per liter while maximum TFC (2925 mg quercetin equivalents per liter) occurred at 67.83% ethanol concentration, 4.96 v/w liquid-to-solid ratio and 49.37 min extraction time. High significant correlations were found between antioxidant activity and both TPC (R(2 )=( )0.81) and TFC (R(2 )=( )0.78).

26156033,"Peanut represents one of the most harmful allergenic foods capable of triggering severe and sometimes lethal reactions in allergic consumers upon ingestion of even small amounts. Several proteins capable of inducing allergic reactions that have been recognised by patients' IgE antibodies have been identified from this nut source. Methods mainly based on ELISA assays have been developed in order to detect peanuts in several food commodities. In addition LC-MS/MS methods based on different mass analysers have also been devised for tracing peanut contamination in different foods achieving low limits of detection. The applicability of a benchtop high-resolution Exactive™ mass spectrometer has never been investigated for the rapid screening of peanut contamination in complex food matrices like mixtures of nuts. We report in this paper the design of suitable peanut markers and the development of an high-resolution Orbitrap™ mass spectrometer-based method for peanut detection in a mixture of nuts species. With this aim, different types of samples were prepared: (1) nuts-based powder made up of a mixture of hazelnuts, pistachios, almonds and walnuts; and (2) nuts powder fortified with peanuts. Different levels of fortifications were produced and the applicability of the method was tested. Finally, a subset of six peptides fulfilling specific analytical requirements was chosen to check the suitability of the method tailored to the detection of peanuts in nuts-based products, and two of them, peptides VYD and WLG, were selected as quantitative markers. The method proved to be a suitable screening tool to assess the presence of traces of peanuts in other tree nuts with a limit of detection as low as 4 µg of peanuts proteins or 26 µg of peanuts in 1 g of matrix.","Food additives & contaminants.

25814275,"To help safeguard the food supply and detect the presence of undeclared food allergens and gluten, most producers and regulatory agencies rely on commercial test kits. Most of these are ELISAs with a few being PCR-based. These methods are very sensitive and analyte specific, requiring different assays to detect each of the different food allergens. Mass spectrometry offers an alternative approach whereby multiple allergens may be detected simultaneously. However, mass spectrometry requires expensive equipment, highly trained analysts, and several years before a quantitative approach can be achieved. Using multianalyte profiling (xMAP®) technology, a commercial multiplex test kit based on the use of established antibodies was developed for the simultaneous detection of up to 14 different food allergens plus gluten. The assay simultaneously detects crustacean seafood, egg, gluten, milk, peanut, soy, and nine tree nuts (almond, Brazil nut, cashew, coconut, hazelnut, macadamia, pine nut, pistachio, and walnut). By simultaneously performing multiple tests (typically two) for each analyte, this magnetic bead-based assay offers built-in confirmatory analyses without the need for additional resources. Twenty-five of the assays were performed on buffer extracted samples, while five were conducted on samples extracted using reduced-denatured conditions. Thus, complete analysis for all 14 allergens and gluten requires only two wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. This makes it possible to include in a single analytical run up to 48 samples. All 30 bead sets in this multiplex assay detected 5 ng/mL of food allergen and gluten with responses greater than background. In addition, 26 of the bead sets displayed signal/noise ratios of five or greater.

The absorption spectra were evaluated with respect to synthetic ligand concentration, time of complexation and pH. Therefore according the absorbance values, 0.015 mmol L(-1) BSIIOT, 10 min after mixing and pH 8.0 were used as optimum values. The complex formation between BSIIOT ligand and the cations Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) by application of rank annihilation factor analysis (RAFA) were investigated. Daubechies-4 (db4), discrete Meyer (dmey), Morlet (morl) and Symlet-8 (sym8) continuous wavelet transforms for signal treatments were found to be suitable among the wavelet families. The applicability of new synthetic ligand and selected mother wavelets were used for the simultaneous determination of strongly overlapped spectra of species without using any pre-chemical treatment. Therefore, CWT signals together with zero crossing technique were directly applied to the overlapping absorption spectra of Cu(2+) and Pb(2+). The calibration graphs for estimation of Pb(2+) and Cu (2+)were obtained by measuring the CWT amplitudes at zero crossing points for Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) at the wavelet domain, respectively. The proposed method was validated by simultaneous determination of Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) ions in red beans, walnut, rice, tea and soil samples.

25461603,"African walnut (Tetracarpidium conophorum Mull. Arg) is commonly processed by boiling or toasting and consumed as a snack or used as a thickener in many West African soup preparations. The nuts are usually exposed to both high temperatures and high relative humidity in open markets which predisposes them to fungal growth. Hence, the dangers of spore inhalation and resultant mycosis cannot be over-emphasized as retailers and consumers are always in direct contact with these nuts during harvest, processing and consumption. So far, there is no reported research on potential mycotoxin contamination of African walnut and whether this risk might be accentuated by processing. African walnut, at early and late maturity stages, were processed by toasting, boiling or left unprocessed before being stored at 25°C and 37°C, respectively under controlled relative humidity for 7days. Nuts were cracked and shell pieces cultured in malt extract agar (MEA) and Dichloran Glycerol 18 (DG18) media and incubated at 25°C for 7days. Results revealed that potential mycotoxigenic species - Aspergillus section Nigri, Aspergillus flavus/parasiticus, Fusarium spp. and Penicillium spp. - were frequently isolated. When compared with unprocessed nuts, toasting completely prevented fungal contamination in shell pieces from nuts in the non-stored (NSN) group at the early maturity stage, while boiling significantly reduced the level of contamination to about 58% (p<0.05). In general, simulating open market conditions caused 100% fungal contamination in all boiled samples and toasted samples at early maturity. However, contamination in toasted samples at late maturity was increased to 90 and 70% at 25°C in DG18 and MEA, respectively, while at 37°C contamination was 40 and 60% in DG18 and MEA, respectively. Mycotoxin analysis using Yeast Extract Sucrose (YES) agar and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)-Fluorescence detection (FLD) showed that Aflatoxins - G1 (AFG1), B1 (AFB1), G2 (AFG2), and B2 (AFB2) were produced by 20 isolates with both AFG1 and AFB1 being predominant at concentration ranges 4.33-32,200 and 4.20-22,700ng/g plug weight, respectively. No ochratoxin A (OTA) was detected out of 23 isolates analysed. From these findings, it is suggested that toasting of nuts, preferably at early maturity is a safer processing option than boiling in terms of prevention of possible fungal growth on nut shells and risk of mycotoxin contamination.

In addition to 2S albumins, a series of peptides from the N-terminal region of the 7S seed storage globulin proprotein were also identified and characterized. These peptides comprised a four-cysteine motif (C-X-X-X-C-X10-12-C-X-X-X-C) repeated throughout the 7S N-terminal region. Upon IgE immunoblotting, 3/11 and 5/11 sera from walnut-allergic subjects showed IgE reactivity to the 7S N-terminal fragments and 2S albumin, respectively. The mature 7S protein and the newly described 7S N-terminal peptides represent two distinct types of allergens. Because the proteolytic processing of 7S globulins has not been elucidated in many edible plant species, similar protein fragments may be present in other nuts and seeds.

25185390,"Commercial activated carbon is a highly effective absorbent that can be used to remove micropollutants from water. As a result, the demand for activated carbon is increasing. In this study, we investigated the optimum manufacturing conditions for producing activated carbon from ligneous wastes generated from food processing. Jujube seeds and walnut shells were selected as raw materials. Carbonization and steam activation were performed in a fixed-bed laboratory electric furnace. To obtain the highest iodine number, the optimum conditions for producing activated carbon from jujube seeds and walnut shells were 2 hr and 1.5 hr (carbonization at 700 degrees C) followed by 1 hr and 0.5 hr (activation at 1000 degrees C), respectively. The surface area and iodine number of activated carbon made from jujube seeds and walnut shells were 1,477 and 1,184 m2/g and 1,450 and 1,200 mg/g, respectively. A pore-distribution analysis revealed that most pores had a pore diameter within or around 30-40 angstroms, and adsorption capacity for surfactants was about 2 times larger than the commercial activated carbon, indicating that waste-based activated carbon can be used as alternative. Implications: Wastes discharged from agricultural and food industries results in a serious environmental problem. A method is proposed to convert food-processing wastes such as jujube seeds and walnut shells into high-grade granular activated carbon. Especially, the performance of jujube seeds as activated carbon is worthy of close attention. There is little research about the application ofjujube seeds. Also, when compared to two commercial carbons (Samchully and Calgon samples), the results show that it is possible to produce high-quality carbon, particularly from jujube seed, using a one-stage, 1,000 degrees C, steam pyrolysis.

The main objectives of the present study were to (1) discover potential food exposure markers (PEMs) for a range of plant foods in a study setting with a mixed dietary background and (2) validate PEMs found in a previous meal study. Three-day weighed dietary records and 24-h urine samples were collected three times during a 6-month parallel intervention study from 107 subjects randomized to two distinct dietary patterns. An untargeted UPLC-qTOF-MS metabolomics analysis was performed on the urine samples, and all features detected underwent strict data analyses, including an iterative paired t test and sensitivity and specificity analyses for foods. A total of 22 unique PEMs were identified that covered 7 out of 40 investigated food groups (strawberry, cabbages, beetroot, walnut, citrus, green beans and chocolate). The PEMs reflected foods with a distinct composition rather than foods eaten more frequently or in larger amounts. We found that 23 % of the PEMs found in a previous meal study were also valid in the present intervention study. The study demonstrates that it is possible to discover and validate PEMs for several foods and food classes in an intervention study with a mixed dietary background, despite the large variability in such a dataset.

The method was validated for peanuts as representative matrix and was subsequently evaluated for the other eight matrices. Quantification limits obtained for aflatoxins, the unique mycotoxins legislated on these matrices, were lower than the maximum levels allowed by the current legislation, while quantification limits obtained for the other mycotoxins were lower than the limits usually permitted by the legislation in other food matrices. Precision of the method was always lower than 11%, and recoveries ranged between 60.7% and 104.3%.

23819821,"The aim of this study was to determine the level of bound 3-monochloropropan-1,2-diol in foodstuffs commonly consumed in Hong Kong, China, by an enzymatic hydrolysis indirect method which proved to be free from interferences. A total of 290 samples were picked up randomly from the local market and analysed. About 73% of these samples were found to contain detectable amounts of bound 3-MCPD. Amongst the 73 food items, bound 3-MCPD was not detected in 13 food items, including extra virgin olive oil, beef ball/salami, beef flank, ham/Chinese ham, nuts, seeds, soy sauce, oyster sauce, butter, yoghurt, cream, cheese and milk. For those found to contain detectable bound 3-MCPD, the content ranged up to 2500 µg kg(-1). The highest mean bound 3-MCPD content among the 14 food groups was in biscuits (440 [50-860] µg kg(-1)), followed by fats and oils (390 [n.d.-2500] µg kg(-1)), snacks (270 [9-1000] µg kg(-1)), and Chinese pastry (270 [n.d.-1200] µg kg(-1)). Among the samples, the highest bound 3-MCPD content was in a grape seed oil (2500 µg kg(-1)), followed by a walnut flaky pastry (1200 µg kg(-1)) and a grilled corn (1000 µg kg(-1)).

It was found that the assimilable part of elements was not dependent on nut cultivar. The bioaccessible fraction of Cu, Mn, and Zn was definitely higher for hazelnuts (62% Cu, 39% Mn, 58% Zn) than for walnuts (14% Cu, 21% Mn, 15% Zn). Bioaccessible Fe was 20-24% from its total content for both nut types. Solubility in the simulated intestinal juice is affected by both formation of stable soluble complexes and back sorption of dissolved elements on nut solid residues. Lead shows strong insolubility due to the high sorption affinity of lead ions to the insoluble fraction of nuts. Thus, walnuts and hazelnuts could act as effective biosorbents for lead detoxication.

21985331,"Uncharacteristic of most whole foods, the major component of tree nuts is lipid; surprisingly, information on the lipid constituents in tree nuts has been sporadic and, for the most part, not well reported. Most published papers focus on only one nut type, or those that report a cultivar lack a quality control program, thus making data comparisons difficult. The present study was designed to quantify the healthful lipid constituents of 10 different types of commercially important tree nuts (i.e., almonds, black walnuts, Brazil nuts, cashews, English walnuts, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pine nuts, and pistachios) according to standardized, validated methods. The total lipid content of each nut type ranged from 44.4 ± 1.9% for cashews to 77.1 ± 1.7% for macadamias. As expected, the major fatty acids present in the tree nuts were unsaturated: oleic (18:1 ω9) and linoleic (18:2 ω6) acids. A majority of the lipid extracts contained <10% saturated fatty acids with the exceptions of Brazil nuts (24.5%), cashews (20.9%), macadamias (17.1%), and pistachios (13.3%). The total tocopherol (T) content ranged from 1.60 ± 1.27 mg/100 g nutmeat in macadamias to 32.99 ± 0.78 in black walnuts. The predominant T isomers in the nut types were α- and γ-T. Tocotrienols were also detected, but only in 6 of the 10 nut types (i.e., Brazil nut, cashews, English walnuts, macadamias, pine nuts, and pistachios). In most cases, total phytosterol contents were greater in the present study than reported in peer-reviewed journal papers and the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, which is attributed to total lipid extraction and the inclusion of steryl glucosides in the analysis; the levels were highest for pistachios (301.8 ± 15.4 mg/100 g nutmeat) and pine nuts (271.7 ± 9.1 mg/100 g nutmeat).

21774594,"Walnuts contain multiple ingredients that, individually, have been shown to slow cancer growth, including omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and phytosterols. In previous research, consumption of walnuts has slowed the growth of implanted breast cancers. We wanted to determine whether regular walnut consumption might reduce the risk for developing cancer. Homozygous male C(3)1 TAg mice were bred with female SV129 mice consuming either the control AIN-76 diet or the walnut-containing diet. At weaning, the female hemizygous pups were randomized to control or walnut-containing diets and followed for tumor development. Compared to a diet without walnuts, consumption of walnuts significantly reduced tumor incidence (fraction of mice with at least one tumor), multiplicity (number of glands with tumor/mouse), and size.

The 2S albumin gene was amplified from the pecan cDNA library. Dot-blots were used to screen the recombinant protein with pecan allergic patients' serum. The affinity purified native protein was analyzed by Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. Cross-reactivity with walnut was determined by inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sequential epitopes were determined by probing the overlapping peptides with three different patients' serum pool. The 3-dimensional homology model was generated, and the locations of the pecan epitopes were compared with those of known sequential epitopes on other allergenic tree nut homologues. Of 28 patients tested by dot-blot, 22 (79%) bound to 2S albumin, designated as Car i 1. Edman sequencing and the MS/MS sequencing of native 2S albumin confirmed the identity of recombinant (r) Car i 1. Both pecan and walnut protein extracts inhibited the IgE-binding to rCar i 1. Sequential epitope mapping indicated weak, moderate, and strong reactivity against 12, 7, and 5 peptides, respectively.

The oils of almond, Brazil nut, hazelnut, pecan, pine nut, pistachio, and walnut were extracted using two solvent extraction systems, namely, hexane and chloroform/methanol. The chloroform/methanol system afforded a higher oil yield for each tree nut type examined (pine nut had the highest oil content, whereas almond had the lowest). The fatty acid compositions of tree nut oils were analyzed using gas chromatography, showing that oleic acid was the predominant fatty acid in all samples except pine nut and walnut oils, which contained high amounts of linoleic acid. The tocopherol compositions were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography, showing that alpha- and gamma-tocopherols were the predominant tocopherol homologues present; however delta- and beta-tocopherols were also detected in some samples. The oxidative stability of nonstripped and stripped tree nut oils was examined under two conditions, namely, accelerated autoxidation and photooxidation. Progression of oxidation was monitored using tests for conjugated dienes, peroxide value, p-anisidine value, and headspace volatiles. Primary products of oxidation persisted in the earlier stages of oxidation, whereas secondary oxidation product levels increased dramatically during the later stages of oxidation.

The sample pretreatment process involved the reflux extraction using methanol as the extract with a ratio of liquor to sample of 15 mL/g. The separation was achieved on a SinoChrom ODS-AP C(18) column with gradient elution using acetonitrile and 2% (v/v) acetic acid in water. The intra-day and inter-day precision (RSD%) for the analytes ranged from 1.08 to 1.51 and 0.60 to 1.13, respectively. The average recoveries obtained were from 88.4% to 96.2% for the analytes with RSDs below 3.13%. The correlation coefficients of the calibration curve exceeded 0.999.

Peptides obtained from tryptic digestion of Ara h 2 and Ara h 3/4 proteins were identified and characterized by LC-MS and LC-MS-MS with a quadrupole-time of flight mass analyzer. Four peptides were chosen and investigated as biomarkers taking into account their selectivity, the absence of missed cleavages, the uniform distribution in the Ara h 2 and Ara h 3/4 protein isoforms together with their spectral features under ESI-MS-MS conditions, and good repeatability of LC retention time. Because of the different expression levels, the selection of two different allergenic proteins was proved to be useful in the identification and univocal confirmation of the presence of peanuts in foodstuffs.

Random amplification of polymorphic DNA-PCR analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their origin. As shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the pH 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free AA, the secondary proteolysis of Barricato San Martino and Vento d'Estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses.

15975066,"Fibrillar amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is the principal component of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. We have studied the effect of walnut extract on Abeta fibrillization by Thioflavin T fluorescence spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The walnut extract not only inhibited Abeta fibril formation in a concentration and time- dependent manner but it was also able to defibrillize Abeta preformed fibrils. Over 90% inhibition of Abeta fibrillization was observed with 5 microl of methanolic extract of walnut (MEOW) both after 2 and 3 days of incubation. The maximum defibrillization (91.6%) was observed when preformed Abeta fibrils were incubated with 10 microl of MEOW for 2 days. These results suggest that walnuts may reduce the risk or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease by maintaining Abeta in the soluble form.

15030196,"In this work the quantitative determination and analytical speciation of arsenic were undertaken in different types of nuts, randomly purchased from local markets. The hardness of the whole nuts and high lipid content made the preparation of this material difficult for analysis. The lack of sample homogeneity caused irreproducible results. To improve the precision of analysis, arsenic was determined separately in nut oil and in the defatted sample. The lipids were extracted from the ground sample with the two portions of a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1). The defatted material was dried and ground again, yielding a fine powder. The nut oil was obtained by combining the two organic extracts and by evaporating the solvents. The two nut fractions were microwave digested, and total arsenic was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results obtained for oils from different types of nuts showed element concentration in the range 2.9-16.9 ng g(-)(1). Lower levels of arsenic were found in defatted material (<0.1 ng g(-)(1) with the exception of Brazil nuts purchased with and without shells, 3.0 and 2.8 ng g(-)(1) respectively). For speciation analysis of arsenic in nut oils, elemental species were extracted from 2 g of oil with 12 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 8 mL of deionized water. The aqueous layer, containing polar arsenic species, was evaporated and the residue dissolved and analyzed by ion chromatography-ICP-MS. The anion exchange chromatography enabled separation of As(III), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAs(V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAs(V)), and As(V) within 8 min. Several types of nuts were analyzed, including walnuts, Brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, pine nuts, peanuts, pistachio nuts, and sunflower seeds. The recovery for the speciation procedure was in the range 72.7-90.6%. The primary species found in the oil extracts were As(III) and As(V).

14727919,"Juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) and plumbagin (5-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) are yellow pigments found in black walnut (Juglans regia). Herbal preparations derived from black walnut have been used as hair dyes and skin colorants in addition to being applied topically for the treatment of acne, inflammatory diseases, ringworm, and fungal, bacterial, or viral infections. We have studied the cytotoxicity of these quinones to HaCaT keratinocytes. Exposure to juglone or plumbagin (1-20 microM) resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability. The cytotoxicity of these quinones is due to two different mechanisms, namely, redox cycling and reaction with glutathione (GSH). Redox cycling results in the generation of the corresponding semiquinone radicals, which were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance. Incubation of keratinocytes with the quinones generated hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and resulted in the oxidation of GSH to GSSG. Depletion of GSH by buthionine sulfoximine enhanced semiquinone radical production, increased H(2)O(2) generation, and produced greater cytotoxicity, suggesting that GSH plays an important protective role. Both quinones decreased the intracellular levels of GSH. However, plumbagin stoichiometrically converted GSH to GSSG, indicating that redox cycling is its main metabolic pathway. In contrast, much of the GSH lost during juglone exposure, especially at the higher concentrations (10 and 20 microM), did not appear as GSSG, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of this quinone may also involve nucleophilic addition to GSH. Our findings indicate that topical preparations containing juglone and plumbagin should be used with care as their use may damage the skin.

In the young trees, the CO(2) compensation point in the absence of mitochondrial respiration (Gamma*), which probes the CO(2) versus O(2) specificity of Rubisco, was not significantly different in sun and shade leaves. The maximal net assimilation rates and stomatal and mesophyll conductances to CO(2) transfer were markedly lower in shade than in sun leaves. Dark respiration rates were also lower in shade leaves. However, the percentage inhibition of respiration by light during photosynthesis was similar in both sun and shade leaves. The extent of the changes in photosynthetic capacity and mesophyll conductance between sun and shade leaves under simulated conditions was similar to that observed between sun and shade leaves collected within the mature tree crown. Moreover, mesophyll conductance was strongly correlated with maximal net assimilation and the relationships were not significantly different between the two experiments, despite marked differences in leaf anatomy.

12172680,"In addition to determination of total selenium in nuts, the element distribution among different fractions (lipid extract, low molecular weight, and protein fractions), and speciation analysis were studied. Improved precision for total selenium determination was observed after elimination of lipids. Because selenium was not detected in any of the lipid extracts obtained from the different types of nuts (ICP-MS), in each determination and/or speciation procedure used in this work lipids were extracted (chloroform-methanol, 2:1) and discarded before analysis. In agreement with previously reported data, high selenium levels were found in Brazil nuts (those purchased without shells contained approximately a quarter the content than those purchased with shells) and significantly lower levels in walnuts, cashews, and pecans nuts. Low-molecular-weight compounds were extracted with perchloric acid (0.4 mol L(-1)) to furnish a fraction containing 3 to 15% of the total selenium in different types of nuts. The proteins were isolated from nut samples by dissolution in 0.1 mol L(-1) sodium hydroxide and subsequent precipitation with acetone. They were then dissolved in phosphate buffer pH 7.5. Analysis of protein fractions focused on selenium in two possible states - weakly and firmly bound to proteins. Results obtained for Brazil nuts by size-exclusion chromatography with on-line ICP-MS detection, in the absence and in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol, showed that approximately 12% of total selenium was weakly bound to proteins. To obtain information about firmly bound selenium, the protein extracts were hydrolyzed enzymatically with proteinase K. Speciation was performed by means of ion-pairing HPLC-ICP-MS.

11694605,"Recent epidemiologic studies have associated nut consumption with a reduced incidence of cardiovascular mortality. However, little is known about the contribution of nut polyphenols to antioxidant and cardiovascular protection. In this investigation, polyphenol-rich extracts from English walnuts (Juglans regia) were studied and compared with ellagic acid for their ability to inhibit in vitro plasma and LDL oxidation, as well as their effects on LDL alpha-tocopherol during oxidative stress. In addition, the Trolox equivalent antioxidant activity (TEAC) was determined and liquid chromatography electrospray detection mass spectrometry (LC-ELSD/MS) analyses of the walnut extracts were performed. 2,2'-Azobis'(2-amidino propane) hydrochloride (AAPH)-induced LDL oxidation was significantly inhibited by 87 and 38% with the highest concentration (1.0 micromol/L) of ellagic acid and walnut extract, respectively. In addition, copper-mediated LDL oxidation was inhibited by 14 and 84% in the presence of ellagic acid and walnut extract, respectively, with a modest, significant LDL alpha-tocopherol sparing effect observed. Plasma thiobarbituric acid reacting substance (TBARS) formation was significantly inhibited by walnut extracts and ellagic acid in a dose-dependent manner, and the extracts exhibited a TEAC value greater than that of alpha-tocopherol.

11588904,"The tocopherols, the major vitamers of vitamin E, are believed to play a role in the prevention of human aging-related diseases such as cancer and heart disease, yet little is known concerning determinants of their plasma concentrations. Evidence from animal studies suggests that the dietary source of gamma-tocopherol can significantly affect plasma levels of this tocopherol as well as its functional vitamin E activity. To determine whether plasma levels of tocopherols in humans are similarly altered, a study was undertaken in which subjects (n = 9) were fed muffins containing equivalent amounts of gamma-tocopherol from sesame seeds, walnuts, or soy oil. We observed that consumption of as little as 5 mg of gamma-tocopherol per day over a three-day period from sesame seeds, but not from walnuts or soy oil, significantly elevated serum gamma-tocopherol levels (19.1% increase, p = 0.03) and depressed plasma beta-tocopherol (34% decrease, p = 0.01). No significant changes in baseline or postintervention plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, or carotenoids were seen for any of the intervention groups. All subjects consuming sesame seed-containing muffins had detectable levels of the sesame lignan sesamolin in their plasma. Consumption of moderate amounts of sesame seeds appears to significantly increase plasma gamma-tocopherol and alter plasma tocopherol ratios in humans and is consistent with the effects of dietary sesame seeds observed in rats leading to elevated plasma gamma-tocopherol and enhanced vitamin E bioactivity.",Nutrition and cancer,"['D000328', 'D000375', 'D000975', 'D001939', 'D002851', 'D004149', 'D005260', 'D005504', 'D006801', 'D017705', 'D008297', 'D008875', 'D009754', 'D012639', 'D012715', 'D013024', 'D024505', 'D024504']","['Adult', 'Aging', 'Antioxidants', 'Bread', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dioxoles', 'Female', 'Food Analysis', 'Humans', 'Lignans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuts', 'Seeds', 'Sesame Oil', 'Soybean Oil', 'Tocopherols', 'gamma-Tocopherol']",Effects of dietary sesame seeds on plasma tocopherol levels.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000008', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000097', 'Q000008']","[None, 'metabolism', 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'blood', 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11588904,2002

Apple, asparagus, avocado, banana, carrot, celery, hazelnut, kiwi, onion, orange, pear, pignoli, strawberry, and walnut were particularly rich in Le(a)-carrying N-glycans. Although traces of Le(a)-containing structures were also present in almond, pistachio, potato, and tomato, no such glycans could be found in cauliflower. Coconut exhibited almost exclusively N-glycans containing only xylose but no fucose. Oligomannosidic N-glycans dominated in buckwheat and especially in the legume seeds mung bean, pea, peanut, and soybean.
