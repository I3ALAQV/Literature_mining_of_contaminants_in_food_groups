This study evaluated food additives in bread and pasta products consumed by residents in various regions of Jilin Province, People's Republic of China, from 2019 to 2021. We collected samples of bread and six types of pasta products from farmers' markets and morning markets and used high-performance liquid chromatography, UV-visible spectrophotometry, and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry to detect the content of the following food additives: sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, aluminum, and borate compounds. For 836 samples in total, we detected the presence of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, aluminum, and borate compounds in excess rates reaching 3.5, 10, and 4.7%, respectively.

Although it has been an unauthorized food additive in many countries due to its toxic and carcinogenic possibility, its illegal uses have been detected in certain food products such as pasta, semolina and spices and also in pharmaceuticals. The presence of AO in food products should be monitored, therefore, to minimize the negative health effects on consumers. In this study, a simple, highly sensitive and selective label free detection method was investigated for AO by G-quadruplex-based fluorescent turn-on strategy. The optimum fluorescent detection assay was achieved with a specific G-quadruplex DNA sequence, c-myc, at 400 nM in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4. The linearity of fluorescence intensity depending on AO concentration ranged from 0 to 0.07 µM and LOD and LOQ were 3 nM and 10 nM, respectively. The G-quadruplex-based detection assay was highly specific for AO as compared to other two synthetic food colorings and successfully applied to determine AO in pasta, bulgur and curry powder with recoveries in the range from 70.33% to 106.49%.

Carotenoids were analyzed using HPLC and spectrophotometry. Generally increasing cooking duration non-significantly increased lutein, zeaxanthin, total carotenoids, significantly increased the cis carotenoids but decreased carotenoid retention and firmness regardless of flour type or wheat cultivar. Despite this decrease, whole wheat pasta was significantly firmer than semolina when overcooked regardless of wheat cultivar. Antioxidant capacity was highly influenced by flour type but did not show a clear trend with cooking duration.

Celiac people should consume products without gluten, which are elaborated mainly with maize or other cereals. Contamination of cereals with mycotoxins, such as fumonisins (FBs) and aflatoxins (AFs) is frequently reported worldwide. Therefore, food ingestion is the main source of mycotoxin exposure. A new analytical method was developed and validated for simultaneous analysis of 21 mycotoxins in gluten-free pasta, commonly consumed by celiac population as an alternative to conventional pasta. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS) was used for analyte separation and detection. The mycotoxins included in this work were those widely reported to occur in cereal samples, namely, ochratoxin-A (OTA), aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2), zearalenone (ZON), deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-AcDON and 15-AcDON, respectively), nivalenol (NIV), neosolaniol (NEO), fusarenone-X, (FUS-X), T-2 toxin (T-2) and HT-2 toxin (HT-2), fumonisin B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2, respectively), enniatins (ENN A, ENN A1, ENN B and ENN B1) and beauvericin (BEA).

Obtaining low-gluten products without affecting the rheological properties of wheat could still be considered a new challenge to face. In this investigation, we presented a comprehensive characterization of durum wheat genotypes aimed at identifying low gluten ones, which combine the potential lower toxicity/immunogenicity with conserved yield and rheological properties to encompass the perspective usability for bread or pasta making. A preliminary profiling of gluten proteins was accomplished by immunoassay-based quantification and liquid chromatography coupled to UV detection, focusing on the gliadin fraction as main responsible for immunoreactivity in celiac disease patients. In addition, data on grain protein content, grain yield per spike, dry gluten and gluten index were collected in order to provide complementary information about productivity-related traits and quali-quantitative characteristics related to wheat nutritional value and its technological properties. The whole pool of data was statistically evaluated driving to the selection of a preferred list of candidate low-toxicity genotypes that were subjected to in-vitro simulated gastroduodenal digestion and untargeted HR-MS/MS peptide identification.

30590259,"Durum wheat is widespread cultivated in the Mediterranean basin, where it is used to produce high-quality semolina for pasta. Although over the years local and ancient wheat cultivars have been replaced by new ones, better suited to intensive cultivation, the increasing demand of consumers for nutritional and sensory qualities, as well as their attention to sustainable agronomic practices, renewed the interest toward traditional varieties. In order to fully exploit their agronomical and nutritional potential, a systematic analysis of molecular traits would be desirable. Nowadays, this examination is greatly facilitated by the current availability of high-throughput genomic and proteomic methods, which are integrated with classical measurements on plant physiology. To this purpose, we performed a comparative study on germination performances, hormone level variations, and differential protein representations of three-days germinated shoots of two traditional wheat cultivars from Southern Italy, namely Senatore Cappelli and Saragolla, and the commercial elite variety Svevo. Two-dimensional electrophoresis- and nanoLC-ESI-LIT-MS/MS-based proteomic analysis revealed 45 differentially represented spots, which were associated with 32 non-redundant protein species grouping into storage, stress/defense and metabolism/energy production functional categories. Major differences in the traditional varieties concerned over-representation of glutenins, gamma-gliadin and some enzymes of glycolysis and TCA cycle, as well as a down-representation of proteins involved in the response to stress conditions.

30532162,"Increasing β-carotene (a vitamin A precursor) content in Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (durum wheat) grains is important to improve pasta nutritional quality. Studies in other species show that altering the expression of LCYE genes increases the flux towards the β-β branch, accumulating higher β-carotene levels. Durum wheat is a tetraploid species that has two LCYE genes (LCYE-A and LCYE-B) associated to the A and B genomes. The objective of this work was to produce durum wheat LCYE mutants through EMS to potentially increase β-carotene content. The LCYE point mutations created with EMS were identified using a Kronos TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesion IN Genomes) mutant population. Specific primers that amplified exons 3 through 10 of the LCYE genes were designed and validated. To simplify the TILLING procedure, fragments were digested with CJE (Celery Juice Extract) and visualized on 2% agarose gels. 6X mutant pools were identified, which showed cleavage products and then made into 2X pools to identify mutant individuals. LCYE mutants were then sequenced and evaluated with BLOSUM62, SIFT and PSSM algorithms. Mutants with substitutions W437*, P334L and G368R in LCYE-A and P405L, G352R and T393I in LCYE-B predicted to affect protein function were selected. Substitution W437* increased β-carotene in 75% and overall total carotenoids content in leaves of the mutant 2426 (A1 mutant line), but no significant differences relative to the control were found in grains through HPLC.

30381010,"Due to favourable climate condition, Italy is a prominent producer of different wheat varieties. Several wheat baked goods are produced, but the most typical Italian foods, like pasta, pizza and bread, are made of durum and common wheat flour. Because of the great importance of wheat in the Italian food market, authenticity represents an essential quality parameter not only for the producers and regulatory bodies but also for consumers. The aim of our study was to test the effectiveness of an unconventional non-targeted method for the discrimination of Triticum species using direct analysis real time-high-resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS). For this purpose, 60 wheat samples including durum, common and hulled wheat varieties were collected over two consecutive harvest years. Chemometric evaluation revealed an optimal sample clustering according to the wheat species and the presence of 18 significant markers able to discriminate the groups. The discrimination power obtained is promising since the use of DART-HRMS can significantly reduce the analysis time compared to chromatographic techniques. A plausible future commercial and industrial scenario could see the application of this analytical approach especially to evaluate the risk of substitution of higher value wheat species with lower value flours.","Food additives & contaminants.

The newly produced PPI and PF fractions were processed into pasta-like sheets with varying protein to fiber ratios (100/0, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 and 50/50, respectively) using high temperature compression molding. We studied protein polymerization, molecular structure and protein-fiber interactions, as well as mechanical performance and cooking characteristics of processed PPI-PF blends. Bi-modal particle size distribution and chemical composition of the PPI and PF fractions influenced significantly the physicochemical properties of the pasta-like sheets. Polymerization was most pronounced for the 100 PPI, 90/10 and 80/20 PPI-PF samples as studied by SE-HPLC, and polymerization decreased with addition of the PF fraction. The mechanical properties, as strength and extensibility, were likewise the highest for the 100 PPI and 90/10 PPI-PF blends, while the E-modulus was similar for all the studied blends (around 38 MPa). The extensibility decreased with the increasing amount of PF in the blend. The highest amounts of β-sheets were found in the pasta-like sheets with high amounts of PPI (100, 90 and 80%), by FT-IR. An increase in PF fraction in the blend, resulted into the high amounts of unordered structures as observed by FT-IR, as well as in an increase in the molecular scattering distances observed by SAXS. The water uptake increased and cooking loss decreased with increased proportions of the PF fraction, and the consistency of 10 min cooked pasta-like sheets were alike al dente texture. The new knowledge obtained in this study on the use of extraction-fractionation method to produce novel PPI and PF fractions for developing innovative high nutritious food can be of a great importance.

Italy is the leader in its production and, recently, the worldwide diffusion of its production has begun to grow tremendously. The perceived quality of a food product, such as pasta, is a key feature that allows a company to increase and maintain the competitive advantage of a specific brand. The overall flavor perception of the consumer, therefore, has become as important as other key quality factors such as texture and color; thus, the food industry needs to meet consumer expectations and needs the tools to objectively ""measure"" the quality of food products. Untargeted fingerprinting by means of coupling LC with high-resolution MS (HRMS) has been well received within the analytical community, and different studies exploiting this approach for the characterization of high-value food products have recently been reported in the literature.

28478307,"Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum (Desf.) Husn.) is an economically important crop used for the production of semolina, which is the basis of pasta and other food products. Its grains provide proteins and starch for human consumption. Grain development is a key process in wheat physiology; it is highly affected by a number of enzymes that control the metabolic processes governing accumulation of starch and storage proteins and ultimately grain weight. Most of these enzymes are present in the albumin/globulin grain fraction, which represents about a quarter of total seed proteins. With the aim to describe the dynamic profile of the albumin/globulin fraction during durum wheat grain development, we performed a proteomic analysis of this subproteome using a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based approach and compared six developmental stages. A total of 285 differentially (237 over- and 48 under-) represented spots was identified by nanoLC-ESI-LIT-MS/MS, which were associated with 217 non-redundant Triticum sequence entries. Quantitative protein dynamics demonstrated that carbon metabolism, energy, protein destination/storage, disease/defense and cell growth/division functional categories were highly affected during grain development, concomitantly with progressive grain size increase and starch/protein reserve accumulation.

In view of the importance of gliadin proteins, by combining the quartz crystal microbalance technology, a cheap and robust piezoelectric transducer, with the so-called photonic immobilization technique, an effective surface functionalization method that provides spatially oriented antibodies on gold substrates, we realized a sensitive and reliable biosensor for quantifying these analytes extracted from real samples in a very short time. The resulting immunosensor has a limit of detection of about 4 ppm and, more remarkably, shows excellent sensitivity in the range 7.5-15 ppm.

Hence, it is desirable to develop easy, sensitive and fast analytical screening methods for the determination of AgNPs in complex biological matrices. This study describes such a method using solid sampling high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). A recently reported novel evaluation strategy uses the atomization delay of the respective GFAAS signal as significant indicator for AgNPs and thereby allows discrimination of AgNPs from ionic silver (Ag(+)) in the samples without elaborate sample pre-treatment. This approach was further developed and applied to a variety of biological samples. Its suitability was approved by investigation of eight different food samples (parsley, apple, pepper, cheese, onion, pasta, maize meal and wheat flour) spiked with ionic silver or AgNPs. Furthermore, the migration of AgNPs from silver-impregnated polypropylene food storage boxes to fresh pepper was observed and a mussel sample obtained from a laboratory exposure study with silver was investigated. The differences in the atomization delays (Δt(ad)) between silver ions and 20-nm AgNPs vary in a range from -2.01 ± 1.38 s for maize meal to +2.06 ± 1.08 s for mussel tissue. However, the differences were significant in all investigated matrices and so indicative of the presence/absence of AgNPs.

25085486,"Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA targeting RNA, community-level physiological profiles made with Biolog EcoPlates, proteolysis, and volatile component (VOC) analyses were mainly used to characterize the manufacture and ripening of the pasta filata cheese Caciocavallo Pugliese. Plate counts revealed that cheese manufacture affected the microbial ecology. The results agreed with those from culture-independent approaches. As shown by urea-PAGE, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and free-amino-acid (FAA) analyses, the extent of secondary proteolysis mainly increased after 30 to 45 days of ripening. VOCs and volatile free fatty acids (VFFA) were identified by a purge-and-trap method (PT) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. Except for aldehydes, the levels of most of VOCs and VFFA mainly increased from 30 to 45 days onwards. As shown through pyrosequencing analysis, raw cows' milk was contaminated by Firmicutes (53%), Proteobacteria (39%), Bacteroidetes (7.8%), Actinobacteria (0.06%), and Fusobacteria (0.03%), with heterogeneity at the genus level. The primary starter Streptococcus thermophilus dominated the curd population. Other genera occurred at low incidence or sporadically. The microbial dynamics reflected on the overall physiological diversity. At 30 days, a microbial succession was clearly highlighted. The relative abundance of Streptococcus sp. and especially St. thermophilus decreased, while that of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sp., and especially Lactobacillus paracasei increased consistently. Despite the lower relative abundance compared to St. thermophilus, mesophilic lactobacilli were the only organisms positively correlated with the concentration of FAAs, area of hydrophilic peptide peaks, and several VOCs (e.g., alcohols, ketones, esters and all furans). This study showed that a core microbiota was naturally selected during middle ripening, which seemed to be the main factor responsible for cheese ripening.

24915383,"Gliadins account for 40-50% of the total storage proteins of wheat and are classified into four subcategories, α-, β-, γ-, and ω-gliadins. They have also been classified as ω5-, ω1, 2-, α/β-, and γ-gliadins on the basis of their primary structure and molecular weight. Cysteine residues of gliadins mainly form intramolecular disulfide bonds, although α-gliadins with odd numbers of cysteine residues have also been reported. Gliadins are generally regarded to possess globular protein structure, though recent studies report that the α/β-gliadins have compact globular structures and γ- and ω-gliadins have extended rod-like structures. Newer techniques such as Mass Spectrometry with the development of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) in combination with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) have been employed to determine the molecular weight of purified ω- gliadins and to carry out the direct analysis of bread and durum wheat gliadins. Few gliadin alleles and components, such as Gli-B1b, Gli-B2c and Gli-A2b in bread wheat cultivars, γ-45 in pasta, γ-gliadins in cookies, lower gliadin content for chapatti and alteration in Gli 2 loci in tortillas have been reported to improve the product quality, respectively.

In vitro digestion models able to mimic the peptides generated in the human gastrointestinal tract are extremely useful to assess the pathogenicity of wheat-derived products. In this paper, samples belonging to three different durum wheat varieties were taken at six different steps of the pasta production chain and two different digestion models present in the literature were assessed on the different samples: a more complex one using artificial fluids simulating the exact composition of digestive juices, and a simplified method based on a peptic-tryptic/chymotryptic treatment of wheat ethanolic extract. An extensive characterization of the peptides generated using two in vitro digestion models was performed through LC-MS/MS techniques and the two methods were compared in order to evaluate qualitative and quantitative differences and their possible implications for varietal screening. Strong differences in the type of peptides produced with the two methods were detected, indicating that the simplified method can still be used for a varietal screening but is not representative of the peptides really generated after physiological human digestion.

24054621,"Being common in chromatographic techniques internal standard method is rarely applied in electrochemical stripping determinations. One of the reasons for such rare use of this elegant quantification method is because optimal conditions of accumulation at the electrode for individual compounds producing a reproducible signal may vary significantly. These criteria are much stricter when selenium is in question due to very complex mechanism of its accumulation at mercury electrodes which implies simultaneous cathodic mercury dissolution and chemical reaction. Elements that are in the analytical step stripped cathodically from mercury electrodes are rare, further limiting the application of the internal standard method when electrochemical selenium determination is in question. In this work the possibility of using sulphide for selenium quantification by chronopotentiometric stripping analysis was investigated. Optimal experimental parameters were defined in two-component systems. Dimensionless factors defining the ratio of proportionality constants of the two elements were calculated for different selenium concentration ranges at different sulphide contents. Sulphide content that was chosen as adequate for selenium concentrations reasonably to be expected in food samples was 500 µg/dm(3). Determined detection limit of chronopotentiometric stripping determination of selenium by using a sulphide as an internal standard was 0.04 µg/dm(3) (RSD=7.6%; n=5).

The analysis of furosine was performed by a novel mixed-mode column that provides multiple and simultaneous retention mechanisms including cation-exchange, anion-exchange, reversed-phase, or hydrophilic interaction. Each retention mechanism could be independently controlled by setting chromatographic conditions. Adequate retention and selectivity of polar charged furosine were achieved by adjusting mobile phase pH, buffer concentration, organic content, and ionic strength. The optimized method was successfully applied to determinate furosine in durum wheat semolina pasta samples. Furosine level in pasta may be used as a reliable marker of health and nutritional damage occurring during pasta manufacture. Indeed, a low content of furosine is generally related to high nutritional quality of food and application of mild heat treatments. A wide range of dry pasta samples, collected from both supermarkets (large-scale retail trade) and shops selling local products, were analyzed. Variable amounts of furosine, ranging from 107 to 506 mg/100 g of protein, were found in pasta samples.

23330715,"Starch has unique physicochemical characteristics among food carbohydrates. Starch contributes to the physicochemical attributes of food products made from roots, legumes, cereals, and fruits. It occurs naturally as distinct particles, called granules. Most starch granules are a mixture of 2 sugar polymers: a highly branched polysaccharide named amylopectin and a basically linear polysaccharide named amylose. The starch contained in food products undergoes changes during processing, which causes changes in the starch molecular weight and amylose to amylopectin ratio. The objective of this study was to develop a new, simple, 1-step, and accurate method for simultaneous determination of amylose and amylopectin ratio as well as weight-averaged molecular weights of starch in food products. Starch from bread flour, canned peas, corn flake cereal, snack crackers, canned kidney beans, pasta, potato chips, and white bread was extracted by dissolving in KOH, urea, and precipitation with ethanol. Starch samples were solubilized and analyzed on a high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) system.

For this purpose, 114 commercial samples of pasta were acquired from supermarkets located in Valencia. The results showed higher frequencies of contamination in organic pasta than in conventional pasta, while the concentration levels were variable for both types of pasta. In positive samples, BEA levels varied from 0.10 to 20.96μg/kg and FUS levels varied from 0.05 to 8.02μg/kg. ENs levels ranged from 0.25 to 979.56μg/kg, though the majority of the values were below 25μg/kg. Besides, it was observed the simultaneous presence of two or more mycotoxins in a high percentage of the samples.

So a method for their contemporary detection may be useful for both manufacturers and control agencies quality control. In this research a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric with electrospray ionization method for the multi-determination of seven preservatives (benzoic acid, citric acid, hexamethylenetetramine, lysozyme, natamycin, nisin and sorbic acid) in cheese was developed. The preservatives were contemporarily extracted from cheese by a single procedure, and analyzed by RP-LC/ESI-MS/MS (Ion Trap) in positive ionization mode, with single reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition. Three sample types (hard, pasta filata and fresh cheese) were used for method evaluation. Recoveries were mostly higher than 90%; MDLs ranged from 0.02 to 0.26 mgkg(-1), and MQLs were included between 0.07 and 0.88 mgkg(-1). Due to matrix effect, quantitation was performed by referring to a matrix matched calibration curve, for each cheese typology.

In analytical conditions, the pH value of the run buffer was similar to that of the hydrolyzed samples, which helps in avoiding interactions of the analyte with silanol groups of the inner wall of the fused silica capillary. In all previous CE methods proposed in literature, no SPE treatment has been used. The method has been applied to the analysis of food products, such as flour, having low amounts of furosine. Flour samples of different origin (wheat, chestnut, lupin, einkorn, chickpeas) have been investigated. Different food products such as pasta, milk, and tigelle bread (a typical Italian unleavened bread) were also analyzed. Some of the samples have also been analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC, and when compared to CE-MS, data obtained showed good agreement. CE-MS, in comparison to HPLC, showed advantages in terms of time of analysis and cost. The validation procedure provided good values for LOD and LOQ (respectively 0.07 and 0.25 mg L(-1) ), recovery (77 and 97%), and precision investigated in terms of intraday repeatability (RSD%: 4-6% for peak areas; 1-2% for migration times) and intermediate precision (below 16% for peak areas, and below 7% for migration times).

22632631,"Young, old, pregnant and immuno-compromised persons are of great concern for risk assessors as they represent the sub-populations most at risk. The present paper focuses on risk assessment linked to furan exposure in children. Only the Belgian population was considered because individual contamination and consumption data that are required for accurate risk assessment were available for Belgian children only. Two risk assessment approaches, the so-called deterministic and probabilistic, were applied and the results were compared for the estimation of daily intake. A significant difference between the average Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) was underlined between the deterministic (419 ng kg⁻¹ body weight (bw) day⁻¹) and the probabilistic (583 ng kg⁻¹ bw day⁻¹) approaches, which results from the mathematical treatment of the null consumption and contamination data. The risk was characterised by two ways: (1) the classical approach by comparison of the EDI to a reference dose (RfD(chronic-oral)) and (2) the most recent approach, namely the Margin of Exposure (MoE) approach. Both reached similar conclusions: the risk level is not of a major concern, but is neither negligible. In the first approach, only 2.7 or 6.6% (respectively in the deterministic and in the probabilistic way) of the studied population presented an EDI above the RfD(chronic-oral). In the second approach, the percentage of children displaying a MoE above 10,000 and below 100 is 3-0% and 20-0.01% in the deterministic and probabilistic modes, respectively. In addition, children were compared to adults and significant differences between the contamination patterns were highlighted. While major contamination was linked to coffee consumption in adults (55%), no item predominantly contributed to the contamination in children. The most important were soups (19%), dairy products (17%), pasta and rice (11%), fruit and potatoes (9% each).","Food additives & contaminants.

In this study, we examined how the in vivo starch digestibility is reflected by the glycemic response, because this response is often used to predict starch digestibility. Ten healthy male volunteers [age 21 ± 0.5 y, BMI 23 ± 0.6 kg/m² (mean ± SEM)] participated in a cross-over study, receiving three different meals: pasta with normal wheat bran (PA) and bread with normal (CB) or purple wheat bran (PBB). Purple wheat bran was added in an attempt to decrease the rate of starch digestion. The meals were enriched in ¹³C and the dual isotope technique was applied to calculate the rate of appearance of exogenous glucose (RaE). The ¹³C-isotopic enrichment of glucose in plasma was measured with GC/combustion/isotope ratio MS (IRMS) and liquid chromatography/IRMS. Both IRMS techniques gave similar results. Plasma glucose concentrations [2-h incremental AUC (iAUC)] did not differ between the test meals. The RaE was similar after consumption of CB and PBB, showing that purple wheat bran in bread does not affect in vivo starch digestibility. However, the iAUC of RaE after men consumed PA was less than after they consumed CB (P < 0.0001) despite the similar glucose response.

Protein aggregation was evaluated by the measurement of sensitivity of disulfide bonds toward reduction with dithioerythritol (DTE), at different reactions times. In addition to the loss in protein extractability in sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer, heat treatments induced a drastic change in disulfide bonds sensitivity toward DTE reduction and in size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography profiles of fully reduced protein. The protein solubility loss was assumed to derive from the increasing connectivity of protein upon heat treatments. The increasing degree of protein upon aggregation would be due to the formation of additional interchain disulfide bonds.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002850', 'D004220', 'D004226', 'D005511', 'D005983', 'D006358', 'D012995', 'D014908']","['Chromatography, Gel', 'Disulfides', 'Dithioerythritol', 'Food Handling', 'Glutens', 'Hot Temperature', 'Solubility', 'Triticum']",Mechanisms of heat-mediated aggregation of wheat gluten protein upon pasta processing.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000494', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'pharmacology', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21370874,2011

20922957,"Deoxynivalenol (DON), commonly referred to as vomitoxin, belongs to a class of naturally occurring mycotoxins produced by Fusarium fungi. The presence of DON in foods is a human health concern. The frequency of occurrence of DON in wheat is high, although cleaning prior to milling can reduce DON concentration in final products, and food processing can partially degrade the toxin. This paper describes a method for the determination of DON in some major wheat food products, including bread, breakfast cereals, pasta, pretzels, and crackers. Test samples containing 5% polyethylene glycol were extracted with water. After blending and centrifuging, the supernatant was diluted with water and filtered through glass microfiber filter paper. The filtrate was then passed through an immunoaffinity column and the toxins eluted with methanol. The toxins were then subjected to RPLC separation and UV detection. The accuracy and repeatability characteristics of the method were determined. Recoveries of DON spiked at levels from 0.5 to 1.5 microg/g in the five processed foods were >70%. SD and RSD values ranged from 2.0 to 23.5% and from 2.0 to 23.2%, respectively. HorRat values were <2 for all of the matrixes examined.

Selenium intake estimations based on three different approaches were carried out. From the relationship between intake and serum/plasma concentration, the selenium intake was estimated to 66 µg day(-1). The second approach based on measured food groups combined with consumption statistics; and the third approach consisted of duplicate meal samples. With the last two methods, over 75% of the serum/plasma based intake was confirmed. Swiss pasta made of North American durum wheat was the food with the highest contribution to the dietary intake, followed by meat. The strong decrease in imports of selenium-rich North American wheat of the last years was not reflected in the present intake estimations. It appears that this intake loss was compensated by a consumption increase of other foods.

The limits of quantification ranged from 0.01 to 0.5 microg/kg for OTA and 2 to 10 microg/kg for the fumonisins. OTA was detected in amounts higher than limits of quantification in wheat flour, pasta, oatmeal, rye, buckwheat flour and dried buckwheat noodles, raisins, wine, beer, coffee beans and coffee products, chocolate, cocoa, and coriander. OTA was found in more than 90% of the samples of instant coffee and cocoa, and the highest concentration of OTA, 12.5 microg/kg, was detected in raisins. The concentration of OTA in oatmeal, rye, raisins, wine, and roasted coffee beans varied remarkably from year to year.

Complementary electrophoretic, chromatography, and mass spectrometry techniques were used to characterize the gluten and epitope hydrolysis. Nine peptidases were partially purified from the pooled cytoplasmic extract of the sourdough lactobacilli and used to hydrolyze the 33-mer epitope, the most immunogenic peptide generated during digestion of Triticum species. At least three peptidases (general aminopeptidase type N [PepN], X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase [PepX], and endopeptidase PepO) were necessary to detoxify the 33-mer without generation of related immunogenic epitopes. After 14 h of incubation, the combination of all or at least six different peptidases totally hydrolyzed the 33-mer (200 mM) into free amino acids. The same results were found for other immunogenic epitopes, such as fragments 57-68 of alpha 9-gliadin, 62-75 of A-gliadin, and 134-153 of gamma-gliadin. When peptidases were used for fermentation of durum wheat semolina, they caused the hydrolysis of gluten to ca. 2 ppm.

In this study, a survey of furan contamination in 230 commercially jarred ready-to-eat infant food products was conducted using headspace sampling in combination with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) with a detection limit of 0.2 microg kg(-1). The incidence of furan contamination in jarred infant beverages, cereals and fruits was relatively low, with average concentrations below 10 microg kg(-1). Significantly higher concentrations were found in pasta (34.8 +/- 14.5 microg kg(-1)), meals containing meat (28.2 +/- 15.0 microg kg(-1)), and meals containing vegetables (31.2 +/- 17.3 microg kg(-1)). The average exposure of 6-month-old infants to furan was estimated to be 0.2 microg per kg bodyweight per day. The margin of exposure calculated using the T25 dose descriptor would be 2692, which points to a possible public health risk. In contrast to commercially jarred food products, none of 20 freshly home-prepared baby foods contained furan above the limit of detection. Only after re-heating in closed vessels was furan found to have formed. Furan was especially prevalent in reheated foods containing potatoes, with values ranging between 2.3 and 29.2 microg kg(-1). The formation of furan in potato-containing baby foods was increased by addition of ascorbic acid, by longer heating times above 1 h and by temperatures above 50 degrees C.

19664467,"This paper describes a fast method for the sensitive and selective determination of melamine in a wide range of food matrices, including several milk-based products. The method involves an extraction with aqueous 1% trichloroacetic acid before the injection of the 10-fold diluted extract into the liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) system, using labelled melamine as the internal standard. As melamine is present in aqueous media in the cationic form, the chromatographic separation in reversed-phase LC requires the use of anionic ion-pair reagents, such as tridecafluoroheptanoic acid (THFA). This allows a satisfactory chromatographic retention and peak shape in all the types of food samples investigated. The method has been validated in six food matrices (biscuit, dry pasta and four milk-based products) by means of recovery experiments in samples spiked at 1 and 5 mg kg(-1). Average recoveries (n=5) ranged from 77% to 100%, with excellent precision (RSDs lower than 5%) and limits of detection between 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg(-1). In addition, accuracy and robustness of the method was proven in different soya-based matrices by means of quality control (QC) sample analysis. QC recoveries, at 1 and 2.5 mg kg(-1), were satisfactory, ranging from 79% to 110%. The method developed in this work has been applied to the determination of melamine in different types of food samples. All detections were confirmed by acquiring two MS/MS transitions (127>85 for quantification; 127>68 for confirmation) and comparing their ion intensity ratio with that of reference standards.

19572123,"Cereals and cereal-based food have often been found to be contaminated with the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZON), after infection of the grain with the pathogenic fungus Fusarium. Both the pathogen and the infected plants can chemically modify DON and ZON, including acetylation, glucosidation, and sulfation. Analytical strategies for detection and quantification of DON and ZON are well known and established but often fail to recognize the respective metabolites, which are, therefore, also referred to as ""masked"" mycotoxins. However, several masked forms are also known to be harmful to mammals. Failure to detect these could lead to significant underestimation of the toxic potential of a particular sample. To monitor the levels of DON and ZON metabolites in cereals and cereal-based food, we have developed a LC-MS-MS method capable of simultaneous determination of DON, ZON, and eight of their masked metabolites, namely deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (D3G), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3ADON), zearalenone-4-glucoside (Z4G), alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZOL), beta-zearalenol (beta-ZOL), alpha-zearalenol-4-glucoside (alpha-ZG), beta-zearalenol-4-glucoside (beta-ZG), and zearalenone-4-sulfate (Z4S).

19437441,"A rapid multianalyte-multiclass method with little sample manipulation has been developed for the simultaneous determination of eleven mycotoxins in different food commodities by using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS). Toxins were extracted from the samples with acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v) 0.1% HCOOH and, after a two-fold dilution with water, directly injected into the system. Thanks to the fast high-resolution separation of UHPLC, the eleven mycotoxins were separated by gradient elution in only 4 min. The method has been validated in three food matrices (maize kernels, dry pasta (wheat), and eight-multicereal babyfood (wheat, maize, rice, oat, barley, rye, sorghum, millet)) at four different concentration levels. Satisfactory recoveries were obtained (70-110%) and precision (expressed as relative standard deviation) was typically below 15% with very few exceptions. Quantification of samples was carried out with matrix-matched standards calibration. The lowest concentration successfully validated in sample was as low as 0.5 microg/kg for aflatoxins and ochratoxin A in babyfood, and 20 microg/kg for the rest of the selected mycotoxins in all matrices tested. Deoxynivalenol could be only validated at 200 microg/kg, due the poor sensitivity for this mycotoxin analysis. With only two exceptions (HT-2 and deoxynivalenol), the limits of detection (LODs), estimated for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 from the chromatograms of samples spiked at the lowest level validated, varied between 0.1 and 1 microg/kg in the three food matrices tested.

19435245,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) was determined in 274 samples of dry pasta sold across Canada in 2004 to 2006. Ground sample was extracted with acetonitrile-water (6:4 [vol/vol]), filtered, diluted with phosphate-buffered saline, and cleaned with an immunoaffinity column. Analysis was by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, and in the second year by liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry as well. For 2004 and 2005, the limit of quantitation was approximately 0.5 ng of OTA per g (signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1). In 2006, the limit of quantitation was estimated to be 0.2 ng of OTA per g. Incidence of contamination above 0.5 ng of OTA per g was 21, 18, and 66% in the years 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively, reflecting the contamination variability of durum wheat crops and showing the importance of multiyear surveillance.

Foods from local markets were stored according to usual household habits, freeze-dried, homogenized, and extracted three times with hexane containing butylated hydroxytoluene as a preservative and tocol as an internal standard. A normal-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography system was applied with fluorescence and photodiode array detection that resulted in baseline separation of all eight analytes and the internal standard tocol (To). The sum of all E vitamer concentrations, or total E vitamers (TEV), in all foods analyzed ranged an average from 0.6 to 828 mg/kg (T < or = 542 mg/kg and T3 < or = 432 mg/kg) and showed the following ranges: oils, 497-828 mg/kg (mainly alphaT and gammaT); margarines, 359-457 mg/kg (mainly gammaT); salad dressings, 20-291 mg/kg (mainly gammaT, except alphaT when soy oil was the main ingredient); cookies, 54-138 mg/kg (mainly gammaT); snacks, 101-220 mg/kg (mainly gammaT); nuts, 22-201 mg/kg (mainly alphaT); vegetables, 2-152 mg/kg (mainly alphaT); pasta, 24-90 mg/kg; cereals, 4-56 mg/kg (mainly betaT3 followed by alphaT); fish, 2-39 mg/kg (mainly alphaT); fried tofu, 64 mg/kg (mainly gammaT); breads, 20-22 mg/kg (mainly betaT3); fat-free mayonnaise, 5 mg/kg (mainly alphaT); poi (fermented taro root), 2 mg/kg (mostly alphaT); and fruits, 2 (papaya) to 13 mg/kg (canned pumpkin) with alphaT predominating.

A total of 59 samples (e.g., 20 complete Kamut, semicomplete Kamut, and soft wheat flours, 28 pasta, and 11 semolinas manufactured from complete Kamut, semicomplete Kamut, and hard wheat flours) were analyzed by front-face fluorescence spectroscopy. Tryptophan fluorescence spectra were scanned between 305 and 400 nm on samples following excitation at 290 nm. The principal component analysis (PCA) performed on flour spectra clearly differentiated complete Kamut and semicomplete Kamut samples from those produced from complete and semicomplete soft wheat flours. The PCA performed on pasta spectra discriminated samples manufactured from complete Kamut and complete hard wheat flours from those made with semicomplete Kamut and semicomplete hard wheat flours.

16512258,"Simultaneous Determination of Vitamins.--Klejdus et al. described a simultaneous determination of 10 water- and 10 fat-soluble vitamins in pharmaceutical preparations by liquid chromatography-diode-array detection (LC-DAD). A combined isocratic and linear gradient allowed separation of vitamins in 3 distinct groups: polar, low-polar, and nonpolar. The method was applied to pharmaceutical preparations, fortified powdered drinks, and food samples, for which results were in good agreement with values claimed. Heudi et al. described a separation of 9 water-soluble vitamins by LC-UV. The method was applied for the quantification of vitamins in polyvitaminated premixes used for the fortification of infant nutrition products. The repeatability of the method was evaluated at different concentration levels and coefficients of variation were <6.5%. The concentrations of vitamins found in premixes with the method were comparable to the values declared. A disadvantage of the methods mentioned above is that sample composition has to be known in advance. According to European legislation, for example, foods might be fortified with riboflavin phosphate or thiamin phosphate, vitamers which are not included in the simultaneous separations described. Vitamin B2.--Viñas et al. elaborated an LC analysis of riboflavin vitamers in foods. Vitamin B2 can be found in nature as the free riboflavin, but in most biological materials it occurs predominantly in the form of 2 coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Several methods usually involve the conversion of these coenzymes into free riboflavin before quantification of total riboflavin. According to the authors, there is growing interest to know flavin composition of foods. The described method separates the individual vitamers isocratically. Accuracy of the method is tested with 2 certified reference materials (CRMs). Vitamin B5.-Methods for the determination of vitamin B5 in foods are limited because of their low sensitivity and poor selectivity. Pakin et al. proposed a post-column derivatization of pantothenic acid as a fluorescent compound and used this principle in a specific and sensitive method for the determination of free and bound pantothenic acid in a large variety of foods. A French laboratory invited European laboratories to participate in a series of collaborative studies for this method, which will be carried out in 2005/2006. A more sophisticated method was described by Mittermayer et al. They developed an LC-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method for the determination of vitamin B5 in a wide range of fortified food products. Application of the method to various samples showed consistent results with those obtained by microbiology. Vitamin B6.-Method 2004.07, an LC method for the analysis of vitamin B6 in reconstituted infant formula, was published by Mann et al. In contrast with this method, which quantifies vitamin B6 after converting the phosphorylated and free vitamers into pyridoxine, Viñas et al. published an LC method which determines 6 vitamin B6 related compounds, the 3 B6 vitamers, their corresponding phosphorylated esters, and a metabolite. Accuracy was determined using 2 CRMs. Results were within the certified ranges. Vitamin C.-Franke et al. described an extensive study to vitamin C and flavonoid levels of fruits and vegetables consumed in Hawaii. Vitamin C was determined by measuring ascorbic acid in its reduced state by LC and coulometric detection along with UV absorbance detection at 245 nm. No attempts were made to assess levels of dehydroascorbic acid. Most recent research revealed that cell uptake of dehydroascorbic acid is unlikely to play a major role, which may explain the very low vitamin C activity of orally administered L-dehydroascorbic acid in rats. The food levels found by Franke et al. are variably lower, higher, or equal in comparison to other studies. Iwase described a method for the determination of ascorbic acid in foods using L-methionine for the pre-analysis sample stabilization. Electrochemical detection was used for the quantification. Traditionally, metaphosphoric acid was proven to be a useful dissolving agent for the determination of ascorbic acid. However, it dissolves in water very slowly, it is hygroscopic, and accurate weighing is not easy. Adjustment at pH 2-3 takes a long time. It appeared to be possible to replace metaphosphoric acid by 0.2% phosphoric acid. Methionine played an important role on the stability of ascorbic acid. The method seemed to be applicable to the routine analysis of ascorbic acid in foods. Folic Acid.-Microbiological analysis of total folate in foods is often considered as the golden standard compared to other methods based on, for example, LC. Koontz et al. showed results of total folate concentrations measured by microbiological assay in a variety of foods. Samples were submitted in a routine manner to experienced laboratories that regularly perform folate analysis fee-for-service basis in the United States. Each laboratory reported the use of a microbiological method similar to the AOAC Official Method for the determination of folic acid. Striking was, the use of 3 different pH extraction conditions by 4 laboratories. Only one laboratory reported using a tri-enzyme extraction. Results were evaluated. Results for folic acid fortified foods had considerably lower between-laboratory variation, 9-11%, versus >45% for other foods. Mean total folate ranged from 14 to 279 microg/100 g for a mixed vegetable reference material, from 5 to 70 microg/100 g for strawberries, and from 28 to 81 microg/100 g for wholemeal flour. One should realize a large variation in results, which might be caused by slight modifications in the microbiological analysis of total folate in foods or the analysis in various (unfortified) food matrixes. Furthermore, optimal combination of enzymes and reaction conditions may vary depending on the composition of the food. Padrangi and Laborde showed recently that treatment with alpha-amylase had no significant effect on measured folate in spinach, although addition of protease significantly increased the release of folate. LC/MS applications gain increasing attention because of their specificity. Rychlik used stable isotope dilution assays for the determination of the folate content of broccoli and bread. Compared to data in the literature and food data bases, amounts were significantly lower. Pawlosky et al., however, found comparable values for 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid and folic acid by HPLC analysis with fluorescent detection and HPLC/MS. Among samples analyzed were CRMs and broccoli. Besides folic acid, other water-soluble vitamins were also determined by LC/MS/MS by Leporati et al. The method was applied to the quantitative analysis of the natural content of vitamins in typical Italian pasta samples, as well as in fortified pasta samples produced for the U.S. market. Biotin.-A paper from Staggs et al. included the assertion that existing biotin data in food composition tables are inaccurate because the majority are based on bioassays with all relevant disadvantages. Data in most cases are overestimated with consequences for recommendations for dietary biotin intake. An HPLC/avidin-binding assay was used to analyze 87 foods to support the hypothesis mentioned.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002623', 'D002853', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005527', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D020349', 'D025101', 'D014815', 'D014867']","['Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Food, Fortified', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Vitamin B 6', 'Vitamins', 'Water']",Water-soluble vitamins.,"['Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['methods', None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512258,2006

15913301,"A pool of selected lactic acid bacteria was used to ferment durum wheat semolina under liquid conditions. After fermentation, the dough was freeze-dried, mixed with buckwheat flour at a ratio of 3:7, and used to produce the ""fusilli"" type Italian pasta. Pasta without prefermentation was used as the control. Ingredients and pastas were characterized for compositional analysis. As shown by two-dimensional electrophoresis, 92 of the 130 durum wheat gliadin spots were hydrolyzed almost totally during fermentation by lactic acid bacteria. Mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography analyses confirmed the hydrolysis of gliadins. As shown by immunological analysis by R5-Western blot, the concentration of gluten decreased from 6280 ppm in the control pasta to 1045 ppm in the pasta fermented with lactic acid bacteria. Gliadins were extracted from fermented and nonfermented durum wheat dough semolina and used to produce a peptic-tryptic (PT) digest for in vitro agglutination tests on cells of human origin. The whole PT digests did not cause agglutination. Affinity chromatography on Sepharose-6-B mannan column separated the PT digests in three fractions. Fraction C showed agglutination activity. The minimal agglutinating activity of fraction C from the PT digest of fermented durum wheat semolina was ca. 80 times higher than that of durum wheat semolina.

15796565,"Color is an important parameter involved in the definition of semolina and pasta quality. This character is mainly due to natural pigments (carotenoids) that are present at different levels in cereals and cereal products, due to botanical origin, growing conditions, distribution in the kernel, and technological processes. In food industries, color measurements are usually performed by means of automatic instruments that are rapid and safe, as alternatives to the chemical extraction methods. In this study, automatic measurements (CIE, color-space system L, a, b), water-saturated butanol (WSB), and HPLC determinations have been applied to evaluate the carotenoid content in whole meals and respective semolina samples produced from wheat cultivated in the years 2001 and 2002. In whole meals, total carotenoids, determined by HPLC, were about 3.0 microg/g (2001) and 3.5 microg/g (2002) calculated on dry weight (dw) and about 3.0 and 3.2 microg/g dw in corresponding semolina samples. The b values for the same period were 19.78 and 15.75, respectively, in raw materials and 20.03-21.67 in semolina. Results have confirmed lutein and beta-carotene as the main components mainly responsible for the yellow color in wheat grains.

This work reports a fast, sensitive, and selective procedure for the extraction and determination of carotenoids from cereals and cereal byproducts. The method involves sample saponification and extraction followed by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, allowing the separation of the main carotenoids pigments of cereals, especially lutein and zeaxanthin. An application of the established method to various species of cereals and cereal byproducts is also shown. The highest carotenoid levels were found in maize (approximately 11.14 mg/kg of dry weight), which contains high amounts of beta-cryptoxanthin (2.40 mg/kg of dry weight), and, among the cereals considered, has the highest content of zeaxanthin (6.43 mg/kg of dry weight) and alpha+beta-carotene (1.44 mg/kg of dry weight). With the exception of maize, lutein is the main compound found (from 0.23 to 2.65 mg/kg of dry weight in oat and durum wheat, respectively).

15315376,"The presence of stilbenes in wine is becoming an important issue due to their claimed relation to a low incidence in coronary diseases and their increasing implication as cancer chemopreventive and neuroprotective agents. Total resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L (average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties grown at warm climates.

A total of 90 samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) as the principal method following sample dissolution by dry and wet ashing. Generally, highest contributions for the intake of micronutrients (Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn) arise from bean, rice and wheat flour consumption. Meat, cow milk and the flours, wheat and manioc, are major sources of Al, Cd, Pb and U intake. The daily intake of nine elements via foodstuffs was estimated as: 3.4x10(-4) mg of U, 1.8x10(-3) mg of Cd, 2.8x10(-2) mg of Pb, 2.3x10(-2) mg of Cr, 8.9x10(-2) mg of Ni, 1.12 mg of Cu, 2.5 mg of Mn, 3.5 mg of Al and 4.8 mg of Zn. The intake of toxic elements ranged between 2.7% (Cd) and 30% (U) of the provisional tolerable daily intake and reference dose values indicating that food consumption is, at present, no critical factor for the uptake of these toxic metals, in the population studied here. Concerning micronutrients, the recommended values of daily intake of Cu and Mn are conveniently supplied by the diet; however, for Cr and Zn they are lower than the recommend daily allowance.

They have both quantitative and qualitative effects on dough quality that may relate to differences in their ability to form the inter-chain disulphide bonds that stabilise the polymers. In order to determine the relationship between dough quality and the amounts and properties of the LMW subunits, we have transformed the pasta wheat cultivars Svevo and Ofanto with three genes encoding proteins, which differ in their numbers or positions of cysteine residues. The transgenes were delivered under control of the high-molecular-weight (HMW) subunit 1Dx5 gene promoter and terminator regions, and the encoded proteins were C-terminally tagged by the introduction of the c-myc epitope. Stable transformants were obtained with both cultivars, and the use of a specific antibody to the c-myc epitope tag allowed the transgene products to be readily detected in the complex mixture of LMW subunits. A range of transgene expression levels was observed. The addition of the epitope tag did not compromise the correct folding of the trangenic subunits and their incorporation into the glutenin polymers.

Milling reduced the element content in the order nickel > arsenic > cadmium > lead. In the experimental conditions of this study, slight contamination by atmospheric lead in milling/pasta-making and release of nickel during pasta-making were observed. These issues have evidently been effectively dealt with in industrial processing given that remarkably lower levels of lead and nickel were found in commercial pastas compared with the experimental samples.

The range chromium content in the foods analyzed was between 0.0004 and 0.1641 microgram/g dry weight. White cheese showed the highest chromium content followed by pasta soup, wheat tortilla, bread and meat. The main foods chromium contributors in the diet were: wheat tortilla (20%), white cheese (11%), corn tortilla (11%), pasta soup (10%), milk (10%), meat (9%) and white bread (8%). The daily chromium intake was 30.43 +/- 1.6 micrograms/d. Chromium values obtained in the food analyzed are considered low. Moreover, chromium intake obtained from the diet is not enough to meet the safety and adequate daily chromium intake. Therefore, the population from the Northwestern Mexico has a suboptimal dietary chromium intake.",Archivos latinoamericanos de nutricion,"['D002857', 'D004032', 'D005247', 'D005504', 'D006801', 'D008800', 'D013054']","['Chromium', 'Diet', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Food Analysis', 'Humans', 'Mexico', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",[Chromium content in foods and dietary intake estimation in the Northwest of Mexico].,"['Q000008', 'Q000592', None, None, None, None, None]","['administration & dosage', 'standards', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515227,2001
11308326,"Three industrial pasta processing lines for different products (macaroni, capellini and instant noodles) were sampled at three subsequent stages (semolina, extruded, and dried end products) in the process. Arabinoxylans (AX) and arabinogalactan peptides (AGP) were analyzed. Although very low endoxylanase activities were measured, the level of water-extractable AX (WE-AX) increased, probably because of mechanical forces. No change was observed in the level and structural characteristics of AGP. The WE-AX molecular weight (MW) profiles showed a very small shift toward lower MW profiles; those of AGP revealed no changes as a result of the production process. After separation of WE-AX and AGP, (1)H NMR analysis and gas chromatography of the alditol acetates obtained following hydrolysis, reduction, and acetylation revealed no changes in the arabinose substitution profile of the WE-AX samples during pasta processing. At optimal cooking times, WE-AX losses in the cooking water are small (maximally 5.9%). However, the loss of AGP is more pronounced (maximally 25.0%). Overcooking led to more losses of both components.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002849', 'D005511', 'D005525', 'D005685', 'D009682', 'D013997', 'D014908', 'D014990']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Food Handling', 'Food-Processing Industry', 'Galactans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Time Factors', 'Triticum', 'Xylans']",Behavior of Triticum durum Desf. arabinoxylans and arabinogalactan peptides during industrial pasta processing.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11308326,2001

9239294,"The objective of this study was to determine the nutritional quality of the pasta described above. The work was unique in the following aspects: 1) the drying process was a nonconventional method, consisting of a high-temperature short-time (HTST) process; 2) the nutritional quality of the wheat pasta was improved by the cowpea supplementation. Cowpea was especially chosen due to it being a staple food in the diet of the people in Northeast Brazil. Benefits attributed to the HTST drying process include a reduction in bacterial counts, shorter processing time and less energy consumption. In addition, there are reports in the literature of improved pasta firmness, color intensity, and cooking characteristics, when non Triticum durum materials plus drying are used. The pasta produced in this work was made using 100% soft wheat flour (SP), and soft wheat flour (SF) mixed supplemented with 10, 20 and 30% dehulled cowpea meal (CM); referred to as 10, 20 and 30% SP, respectively. The methods utilized in this project included: AACC methods for proximate analyses and trypsin inhibitor activity determination, atomic absorption spectrophotometry for mineral determination, a dye binding procedure for measuring available lysine, HPLC for amino acid quantification., FAO/WHO amino acid scoring patterns for chemical scores and AOAC for protein digestibility. The protein content of the past as supplemented with CM ranged from 11.3 to 14.2%, while the 100% SF pasta (SP) contained 10.9%. CM supplementation resulted in 52 to 113% more total lysine, and 26 to 82% more available lysine in the CM pasta compared to the SP. Chemical scores for SP were 45 and 59% for preschool and school-age children, respectively. Adding 30% CM to SP improved the above chemical scores to 89 and 100+, respectively. However, the addition of CM compromised the in vitro protein digestibility of SP from 4 to 6%. The addition fo 30% CM provided the SP with greater calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu): 44, 49, 91 and 402% respectively. Cooking the CM pasta resulted in a 50 to 90% retention of mineral content, with the greatest loss being for Cu. In the cooked 30% CM pasta, the contents of Fe, Zn and Ca were, respectively, 50, 67 and 243% greater than their content in the cooked SP. Of the cooked pasta, the only one displaying trypsin inhibitor activity was the 30% CM pasta, which had 0.8 TIU.",Archivos latinoamericanos de nutricion,"['D000328', 'D000601', 'D002648', 'D002675', 'D007887', 'D005433', 'D005527', 'D006358', 'D006801', 'D008239', 'D008903', 'D009753', 'D010946', 'D014908']","['Adult', 'Amino Acids, Essential', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fabaceae', 'Flour', 'Food, Fortified', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Lysine', 'Minerals', 'Nutritive Value', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Triticum']",Nutritional evaluation of a high-temperature dried soft wheat pasta supplemented with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp).,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9239294,1997

The first trial estimated the bromide ion concentrations in fumigated and unfumigated flours and in pastas obtained from these. The concentration of bromide ions in fumigated flours was not significantly different from unfumigated flours. Only some pastas, manufactured from fumigated flours, showed a higher bromide ion concentration than those manufactured from unfumigated flours. The second trial evaluated the bromide ion concentrations of rices, white flours, flours, pastas made only from flours, pastas with eggs and pastas with eggs and spinach, before and after exposure to methyl bromide in their retail packagings. The bromide ion concentrations in fumigated pastas with eggs, pastas with eggs and spinach and rice were higher than in those unfumigated. In the pastas with eggs the bromide ion concentration after fumigation increased ten times (from about 4 to 40 mg/kg). Results showed that the bromide ion and methyl bromide levels estimated in all the foodstuffs examined were lower than the maximum limits fixed by several different national regulations.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D001965', 'D002849', 'D002523', 'D005433', 'D005504', 'D005511', 'D006842', 'D010573']","['Bromides', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Edible Grain', 'Flour', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Hydrocarbons, Brominated', 'Pesticide Residues']",Residues after fumigation with methyl bromide: bromide ion and methyl bromide in middlings and final cereal foodstuffs.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3743833,1986
