Understanding the effect of variety and crop management on nutritional quality is important. The response of four oat varieties to increased nitrogen levels was investigated across multiple locations and years with respect to yield, grain quality and metabolites (assessed via GC- and LC- MS). A novel high-resolution UHPLC-PDA-MS/MS method was developed, providing improved metabolite enrichment, resolution, and identification. The combined phenotyping approach revealed that, amino acid levels were increased by nitrogen supplementation, as were total protein and nitrogen containing lipid levels, whereas health-beneficial avenanthramides were decreased.

Non-targeted analyses (NTA) using LC/HR-MS complement these approaches by producing information-rich data sets where molecular formula can be generated for each detected compound; however, data mining can be labor intensive. Thus, we examined different NTA approaches to reduce the number of compounds needing further investigation, without relying on a suspect list or MS/MS database, both in single ingredient foods (i.e., oats) and more complex, oat-containing samples. We investigated inherent sample variability and utilized this information to build in-house databases for removing food compounds from sample data.

The objective of this study was to analyze the nutritional value of commercial products in terms of their fatty acid profile and protein digestibility from commercial PBMA. Eight commercially available PBMA were selected for fatty acid analysis, performed with gas chromatography of methylated fatty acids (GC-FAME), and, from these, four commercial products (almond drink, hemp drink, oat drink, and soy drink) were selected for a short-term in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) analysis. The fatty acid analysis results showed that most of the products predominantly contained oleic acid (C18:1 ω-9) and linoleic acid (C18:2 ω-6). Hemp drink contained the highest omega-6/omega-3 (ω6/ω3) ratio among all tested products (3.43). Oat drink and almond drink were the PBMA with the highest short-term protein digestibility, non-significantly different from cow's milk, while soy drink showed the lowest value of protein digestibility. In conclusion, PBMA showed a significant variability depending on the plant source, both in terms of fatty acid composition and protein digestibility.

Even though valorized as amendment to agriculture soils, the sanitary impact of this practice is not seriously considered. To assess the risk of the transference of contaminants from PG to agricultural soil-plants food chain, a wild plant species Salicornia arabica grown in PG-contaminated field and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and oat (Avena sativa) grown in laboratory using different rates (10, 20 and 30%) of PG amendment, were tested. The cadmium, lead, chromium, nickel, copper and zinc concentrations in soils and plants were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry and by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, respectively. Measurements showed that Ni, Cu and Pb levels in the amended soils were below international standards except for Cd and Cr which exceeded Chinese, FAO/WHO and European allowable standard limits. Gathered results showed that the more the PG rate increases, the more the bioconcentration factors of heavy metals increased in plants, particularly in the roots. This is a prospective study assuming direct or indirect exposure scenario of different human cohorts by consuming varied common food stuffs. The Human Exposure to Soil Pollutants evaluation and United State Environment Protection Agency models were adopted for the hazard quotient calculation to assess the acceptability of sanitary risk related to each metal.

31798614,"Celiac disease (CD) is an immunogenic disorder that affects the small intestine. It is caused by the ingestion of gluten, a protein network formed by prolamins and glutelins from cereals such as wheat, barley, rye and, possibly, oats. For predisposed people, gluten presents epitopes able to stimulate T-cells causing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, among others unrelated to the gastrointestinal system. The only treatment for CD is to maintain a gluten-free diet, not exceeding 20 mg/kg of gluten, what is generally considered the safe amount for celiacs. Due to this context, it is very important to identify and quantify the gluten content of food products. ELISA is the most commonly used method to detect gluten traces in food. However, by detecting only prolamins, the results of ELISA tests may be underestimated. For this reason, more reliable and sensitive assays are needed to improve gluten quantification. Because of high sensitivity and the ability to detect even trace amounts of peptides in complex matrices, the most promising approaches to verify the presence of gluten peptides in food are non-immunological techniques, like liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Different methodologies using this approach have been developed and described in the last years, ranging from non-targeted and exploratory analysis to targeted and specific methods depending on the purpose of interest. Non-targeted analyses aim to define the proteomic profile of the sample, while targeted analyses allow the search for specific peptides, making it possible to quantify them. This review aims to gather and summarize the main proteomic techniques used in the identification and quantitation of gluten peptides related to CD-activity and gluten-related allergies.",Frontiers in plant science,[],[],Modern Approaches in the Identification and Quantification of Immunogenic Peptides in Cereals by LC-MS/MS.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798614,2020

31681788,"The safety of oats for people with celiac disease remains unresolved. While oats have attractive nutritional properties that can improve the quality and palatability of the restrictive, low fiber gluten-free diet, rigorous feeding studies to address their safety in celiac disease are needed. Assessing the oat prolamin proteins (avenins) in isolation and controlling for gluten contamination and other oat components such as fiber that can cause non-specific effects and symptoms is crucial. Further, the avenin should contain all reported immunogenic T cell epitopes, and be deliverable at a dose that enables biological responses to be correlated with clinical effects. To date, isolation of a purified food-grade avenin in sufficient quantities for feeding studies has not been feasible. Here, we report a new gluten isolation technique that enabled 2 kg of avenin to be extracted from 400 kg of wheat-free oats under rigorous gluten-free and food grade conditions. The extract consisted of 85% protein of which 96% of the protein was avenin. The concentration of starch (1.8% dry weight), β-glucan (0.2% dry weight), and free sugars (1.8% dry weight) were all low in the final avenin preparation. Other sugars including oligosaccharides, small fructans, and other complex sugars were also low at 2.8% dry weight. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the proteins in these preparations showed they consisted only of oat proteins and were uncontaminated by gluten containing cereals including wheat, barley or rye. Proteomic analysis of the avenin enriched samples detected more avenin subtypes and fewer other proteins compared to samples obtained using other extraction procedures. The identified proteins represented five main groups, four containing known immune-stimulatory avenin peptides. All five groups were identified in the 50% (v/v) ethanol extract however the group harboring the epitope DQ2.5-ave-1b was less represented. The avenin-enriched protein fractions were quantitatively collected by reversed phase HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Three reverse phase HPLC peaks, representing ~40% of the protein content, were enriched in proteins containing DQ2.5-ave-1a epitope. The resultant high quality avenin will facilitate controlled and definitive feeding studies to establish the safety of oat consumption by people with celiac disease.",Frontiers in nutrition,[],[],Preparation and Characterization of Avenin-Enriched Oat Protein by Chill Precipitation for Feeding Trials in Celiac Disease.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681788,2020

Gluten is a general name for a class of cereal storage proteins of wheat, barley, and rye that are notably resistant to gastrointestinal digestion. After ingestion, immunogenic peptides are subsequently recognized by T cells in the gastrointestinal tract. The only treatment for CD is a life-long gluten-free diet. As such, it is critical to detect gluten in diverse food types, including those where one would not expect to find gluten. The utility of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using cereal-specific peptide markers to detect gluten in heavily processed food types was assessed. A range of breakfast products, including breakfast cereals, breakfast bars, milk-based breakfast drinks, powdered drinks, and a savory spread, were tested. No gluten was detected by LC-MS in the food products labeled gluten-free, yet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measurement revealed inconsistencies in barley-containing products. In products containing wheat, rye, barley, and oats as labeled ingredients, gluten proteins were readily detected using discovery proteomics.

Compared to our previous prospective study in 2007 on the Spanish market, acrylamide has experienced an important decline (45%) in wheat-based formulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies applied in the sector. However, when all samples were considered, a slight non-significant decrease (18%) was observed. This fact suggests that the reformulation of traditional recipes with innovative cereals and ingredients could increase the acrylamide content in biscuits despite the mitigation strategies applied.

Apart from the 35 volatiles shared by OP and TCOM, there were 23 and 24 volatiles specific to OP and TCOM, respectively, with the later showing more toasting and frying-related volatiles due to the dry frying process of the grains before milling.

31246975,"Gluten is a complex of proteins present in barley, wheat, rye and several varieties of oats that triggers celiac disease in genetically predisposed subjects. Gluten is notoriously difficult to digest by mammalian proteolytic enzymes and therefore, proline-rich digestion-resistant peptides contain multiple immunogenic epitopes. Prolyl endopeptidases (PEP) hydrolyse internal proline residues on the carboxyl side of peptides and have been proposed for food gluten detoxification and as oral enzyme supplementation for celiacs. The aim of this study was to identify new gluten-degrading microbial enzymes with the potential to reduce gluten immunogenicity by neutralizing its antigenic epitopes. Using a gluten-degrading colony screening approach, a bacterial isolate (2RA3) displaying the highest glutenase activity was selected, characterized and its genome completely sequenced. The identification through 16S rDNA gene sequencing showed a 99,1% similarity to Chryseobacterium taeanense. Hydrolysis of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) was further monitored, over a 48-hour period, by colony encapsulation in gliadin-containing microspheres, followed by detection with the G12 anti-GIP monoclonal antibody. Glutenase activity was detected in the extracellular medium of 2RA3 cultures, where gel electrophoresis and gliadin zymography revealed the presence of a ~50 kDa gluten-degrading enzyme. Nano-ESI-Q-TOF of the excised active band identified 7 peptides contained in the protein product predicted for an open reading frame (ORF) in the 2RA3 genome. Based on sequence similarity to the PEP family, the new enzyme was named PEP 2RA3. The PEP 2RA3 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from C. taeanense 2RA3, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminally His-tagged recombinant protein and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein, with predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point of 78.95 kDa and 6.8, respectively, shows PEP activity with standard chromogenic substrates, works optimally at pH 8.0 and 30°C and remains stable at pH 6.0 and 50°C, indicating a potential use in gluten-containing food process applications.

Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic acid hydroxy stearic acid (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi).

30776456,"Cereal grain proteomics can provide valuable information regarding plant growth, nutritional status, adaptation to environmental stresses, and the role that grain proteins play in health disorders, such as coeliac disease. In this study liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to compare the barley proteome after extraction using seven protocols, with and without defatting and protein precipitation steps that aimed to remove interfering secondary metabolites. Tris-HCl and urea buffers yielded 1405 and 1483 proteins (~79% overlap) from barley (cv Sloop). Inclusion of a pre-extraction defatting step yielded 1336 (Tris-HCl) and 1286 (urea) proteins (~74% overlap). Whilst post-extraction TCA/acetone protein precipitation negatively impacted protein recovery, yielding 673 (Tris-HCl) and 734 (urea) proteins. Alcohol-based extraction yielded a lower number of proteins (645), but notably this extraction method co-extracted and enriched the gluten and α-amylase trypsin inhibitors. Based on these preliminary results, proteins were extracted from two selected cultivars of wheat, rye, barley and oats using three extraction protocols. Bioinformatic analyses of the identified proteins provide evidence that the choice of extraction buffer enriches different protein functional classes. The selection of the protein extraction protocol directly influences the identified cereal grain proteome composition, thus affecting the downstream biological interpretation of data. SIGNIFICANCE: LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis revealed that both Tris-HCl and urea-based extraction yielded a similar suite of proteins from cereal grains with remarkable (70-80%) overlap. Yet the peptides derived from the proteins differed, rendering these extraction buffers complementary, in particular resulting in improved protein sequence coverage.

Despite the fact that wheat provides 20% of the world's caloric and protein diet, its metabolic responses to aphid attack, in general, and specifically its production of benzoxazinoid defense compounds are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to compare the metabolic diversity of durum wheat seedlings (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) under attack by three different cereal aphids: i) the English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae Fabricius), ii) the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.), and iii) the greenbug aphid (Schizaphis graminum Rondani), which are some of the most destructive aphid species to wheat. Insect progeny bioassays and metabolic analyses using chromatography/Q-Exactive/mass spectrometry non-targeted metabolomics and a targeted benzoxazinoid profile were performed on infested leaves. The insect bioassays revealed that the plants were susceptible to S. graminum, resistant to S. avenae, and mildly resistant to R. padi. The metabolic analyses of benzoxazinoids suggested that the predominant metabolites DIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin- 3-one) and its glycosylated form DIMBOA-glucoside (Glc) were significantly induced upon both S. avenae, and R. padi aphid feeding. However, the levels of the benzoxazinoid metabolite HDMBOA-Glc (2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside) were enhanced due to the feeding of S. avenae and S. graminum aphids, to which Svevo was the most resistant and the most susceptible, respectively.

30466136,"Zearalenone (ZEA) is a toxic metabolite of Fusarium genera that frequently contaminates cereal grains. India being a tropical country provides suitable conditions for fungal invasion to the cereals. In the absence of any regulatory limits for ZEA in India, the present study was carried out to analyze the contamination levels of ZEA in different cereal samples consumed by Indian population and its exposure assessment through intake. Out of 117 cereal samples comprising of wheat, rice, corn, and oats, 70 (84%) were found to be positive for ZEA contamination, among which 24 (33%) samples exceeded the permissible limits proposed by European Union when analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The positive samples were further validated by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS) analysis. Based on the quantitative estimation of ZEA contamination in cereals and their daily consumption values, the probable daily intake of ZEA was found to be 16.9- and 7.9-fold higher in rice and wheat samples, respectively, than the tolerable daily intake prescribed by European Food Safety Authority. The presence of ZEA at high levels indicates a higher exposure risk for Indian population as wheat and rice are staple foods in India. Thus, there is an immediate need to set the permissible levels of ZEA in India to safeguard the health of 1.34 billion people. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: High levels of ZEA contaminated wheat and rice samples suggest that the consumers are at a greater exposure risk. The study will help the Indian regulatory bodies to set the permissible level of ZEA in different cereal grains so as to safeguard the health of common masses.

Here we report, for the first time, the polyphasic characterization of three cereal-based kefir-like riboflavin-enriched beverages, obtained from oat, maize and barley flours, and their comparison with classical milk-based kefir. The four matrices were successfully fermented with commercial starters: i) milk-kefir and ii) water-kefir, proving the potential of cereal ingredients in the formulation of dairy-like fermented beverages with milk-kefir starter behavior better in these matrices. In the light of their potentiality, seven riboflavin-producing Andean Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) were tested for tolerance to food stresses commonly encountered during food fermentation. Moreover, the LAB strains investigated were screened for spontaneous riboflavin overproducing derivatives. Lactobacillus plantarum M5MA1-B2 with outstanding response to stress, was selected to improve riboflavin content in an in situ fortification approach. The combination of L. plantarum M5MA1-B2 riboflavin overproducing strain with milk kefir starter in oat, lead to cover, for one serving of 100 g, 11.4% of Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).

30186828,"Dietary plant foods are characterized by a vast molecular diversity of glycosylated sterols (SG) that differ in the structure of the steryl backbone. The identification of these polar steryl conjugates represents a major challenge as they are structurally highly similar, and commercial standards are limited to a few naturally abundant species. Spectral databases do not yet contain MS/MS spectra of these sterol conjugates obtained by electrospray ionization (ESI), which would facilitate their reliable identification. Thus, this study aimed at providing novel information on ESI-MS/MS spectra of both abundant and minor SG found in foods. As a first step, however, free sterols (FS) were investigated for their fragmentation behavior as they share the same intermediate ion as SG. Pure SG were obtained from commercially available standard mixtures and minor SG were extracted from different food sources (oat bran, wheat bran, pumpkin seeds, melon, rapeseeds, and potato peel). ESI-MS/MS spectra of 15 FS were assessed and fragment ions reflective of structural features were identified and rationalized. Subsequently, 14 SG were identified at four different levels, while relative retention times from chromatographic separation and spectral features of FS served to identify five SG. Spectral data from FS were directly transferable to SG when analyzed as aglycone ions as shown by similarity scores while SG were characterized by shorter retention times in reverse phase chromatography and the additional analysis as sodiated adduct confirmed their glycosidic nature. Moreover, we report for the first time the occurrence of 24-methylenecholesterol and a 4-monomethyl sterol as glycosidic conjugates in higher plants.

The EAA content and AA composition of the dietary protein source contribute to the differential muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of different proteins. Lower EAA contents and specific lack of sufficient leucine, lysine, and/or methionine may be responsible for the lower anabolic capacity of plant-based compared with animal-based proteins. We compared EAA contents and AA composition of a large selection of plant-based protein sources with animal-based proteins and human skeletal muscle protein. AA composition of oat, lupin, wheat, hemp, microalgae, soy, brown rice, pea, corn, potato, milk, whey, caseinate, casein, egg, and human skeletal muscle protein were assessed using UPLC-MS/MS. EAA contents of plant-based protein isolates such as oat (21%), lupin (21%), and wheat (22%) were lower than animal-based proteins (whey 43%, milk 39%, casein 34%, and egg 32%) and muscle protein (38%). AA profiles largely differed among plant-based proteins with leucine contents ranging from 5.1% for hemp to 13.5% for corn protein, compared to 9.0% for milk, 7.0% for egg, and 7.6% for muscle protein. Methionine and lysine were typically lower in plant-based proteins (1.0 ± 0.3 and 3.6 ± 0.6%) compared with animal-based proteins (2.5 ± 0.1 and 7.0 ± 0.6%) and muscle protein (2.0 and 7.8%, respectively). In conclusion, there are large differences in EAA contents and AA composition between various plant-based protein isolates.

29560488,"This study explored a novel strategy to develop solid-state whole-grain oats as a novel carrier of lactic acid bacteria and a nutraceutical supplement rich in ACE inhibitory peptides. Oats were fermented by Lactobacillus plantarum B1-6, Rhizopus oryzae, or a combination of L. plantarum B1-6 and R. oryzae. L. plantarum showed a much better growth performance in oats when it was combined with R. oryzae than when it was cultured alone, as evidenced by an increase in viable cell count to 9.70 log cfu g-1 after 72 h of fermentation. The coinoculated fermented oats (CFO) and the R. oryzae-fermented oats (RFO) were then selected for investigations on protein hydrolysis and on the functional properties of the released bioactive peptides. The results showed that the soluble protein contents changed from 7.05 mg g-1 to 14.43 and 10.21 mg g-1 for CFO and RFO, respectively. However, the degree of hydrolysis and the content of peptides with molecular masses less than 10 000 Da indicated that the CFO proteins can be degraded to a greater degree. As analyzed by electrophoresis and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, the protein and peptide profiles of CFO and RFO demonstrated that the proteins from CFO were more obviously hydrolyzed and more small peptides were obtained. In addition, both CFO and RFO presented higher ACE inhibitory activities than unfermented oats, whereas the protein extracts from CFO exerted a lower IC50 value of 0.42 mg protein per mL compared with the protein extracts from the other samples. This research has broadened our knowledge on the development of whole-grain oat products as a probiotic carrier and on the difference between mixed solid-state fermentation (SSF) and fungi SSF in terms of protein degradation and the capacity to release ACE inhibitory peptides.

Since then, some efforts have been made to understand their biosynthesis, occurrence, toxicity, toxicokinetics, and finally relevance for consumers. Thus, the probably most important question is whether and how these metabolites contribute to toxicity upon hydrolysis either during food processing or the gastrointestinal passage. To answer this question, firstly, knowledge on the correct stereochemistry of T2 and HT2 glucosides is important as this affects hydrolysis and chemical behavior. So far, contradictory results have been published concerning the number and anomericity of occurring glucosides. For this reason, we set up different strategies for the synthesis of mg-amounts of T2, HT2, and T2 triol glucosides in both α and ß configuration. All synthesized glucosides were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry and used as references for the analysis of naturally contaminated food samples to validate or invalidate their natural occurrence. Generally, 3-O-glucosylation was observed with two anomers of HT2 glucoside being present in contaminated oats. In contrast, only one anomer of T2 glucoside was found. The second aspect of this study addresses the stability of the glucosides during thermal food processing. Oat flour was artificially contaminated with T2 and HT2 glucosides individually and extruded at varying initial moisture content and temperature. All four glucosides appear to be more stable during food extrusion than the parent compounds with the glucosidic bond not being hydrolyzed.",Mycotoxin research,"['D018554', 'D001711', 'D005506', 'D006027', 'D006031', 'D009682', 'D013058', 'D013605']","['Avena', 'Biotransformation', 'Food Contamination', 'Glycosides', 'Glycosylation', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'T-2 Toxin']","Glucosylation of T-2 and HT-2 toxins using biotransformation and chemical synthesis: Preparation, stereochemistry, and stability.","['Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000031']","['chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analogs & derivatives']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29511991,2018

CD patients need to follow a gluten-free diet by consuming gluten-free products with gluten contents of less than 20 mg/kg. Currently, the recommended method for the quantitative determination of gluten is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the R5 monoclonal antibody. Because the R5 ELISA mostly detects the prolamin fraction of gluten, a new independent method is required to detect prolamins as well as glutelins.

The quantitation of each marker peptide in the chymotryptic digest of a defined amount of the respective reference wheat protein type resulted in peptide-specific yields. This enabled the conversion of peptide into protein type concentrations. Gluten contents were expressed as sum of all determined protein type concentrations.

In particular, oat-based products show a higher incidence and level of contamination. Extrusion cooking is widely used in the manufacturing of breakfast cereals and snacks and may reduce mycotoxins to varying degrees. Hence, the effects of extrusion cooking on the stability of OTA in spiked (100 μg/kg) oat flake was investigated by using a laboratory-scale twin-screw extruder with a central composite design. Factors examined were moisture content (20, 25, and 30% dry weight basis), temperature (140, 160, and 180°C), screw speed (150, 200, and 250 rpm), and die size (1.5, 2, and 3 mm). Both nonextruded and extruded samples were analyzed for reductions of OTA by high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with fluorescence detection. The percentage of reductions in OTA in the contaminated oat flakes upon extrusion processing were in the range of 0 to 28%.

Based on the pesticide levels recovered from each of the different millings and the corresponding particle size distributions, it was confirmed that smaller average particle sizes increase the extraction efficiency up to 31%, with all other factors equal. The cereals milled at room temperature produced lower pesticide extraction efficiencies compared with cereals milled when still frozen, especially for heat-sensitive pesticides.

28234993,"Gluten proteins from wheat, rye, barley and, in rare cases, oats, are responsible for triggering hypersensitivity reactions such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy. Well-defined reference materials (RM) are essential for clinical studies, diagnostics, elucidation of disease mechanisms and food analyses to ensure the safety of gluten-free foods. Various RM are currently used, but a thorough characterization of the gluten source, content and composition is often missing. However, this characterization is essential due to the complexity and heterogeneity of gluten to avoid ambiguous results caused by differences in the RM used. A comprehensive strategy to isolate gluten protein fractions and gluten protein types (GPT) from wheat, rye, barley and oat flours was developed to obtain well-defined RM for clinical assays and gluten-free compliance testing. All isolated GPT (ω5-gliadins, ω1,2-gliadins, α-gliadins, γ-gliadins and high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits from wheat, ω-secalins, γ-75k-secalins, γ-40k-secalins and high-molecular-weight secalins from rye, C-hordeins, γ-hordeins, B-hordeins and D-hordeins from barley and avenins from oats) were fully characterized using analytical reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), N-terminal sequencing, electrospray-ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS) and untargeted LC-MS/MS of chymotryptic hydrolyzates of the single GPT. Taken together, the analytical methods confirmed that all GPT were reproducibly isolated in high purity from the flours and were suitable to be used as RM, e.g., for calibration of LC-MS/MS methods or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).",PloS one,"['D018554', 'D002138', 'D002851', 'D004591', 'D004797', 'D005433', 'D005504', 'D005983', 'D001467', 'D006868', 'D010455', 'D000072417', 'D012016', 'D012434', 'D021241', 'D014908']","['Avena', 'Calibration', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flour', 'Food Analysis', 'Glutens', 'Hordeum', 'Hydrolysis', 'Peptides', 'Protein Domains', 'Reference Values', 'Secale', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Triticum']","Isolation and characterization of gluten protein types from wheat, rye, barley and oats for use as reference materials.","['Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28234993,2017

Infants and young children may be more susceptible to contaminants than adults because of their lower body weight, higher metabolic rate, reduced ability to detoxify food toxicants, and more restricted diet. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence and levels of OTA in infant formula and infant cereal products available in the U.S. market. In the present study, 98 powdered infant formula (milk- and soy-based) samples and 155 infant cereal (barley-, rice-, oat-, wheat-, and mixed grain-based) products were collected from different retail locations in the United States over a 2-year period. OTA levels were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Although OTA was not detected in any of the infant formula samples, 47 (30%) of 155 infant cereals were contaminated with OTA in the range of 0.6 to 22.1 ng/g. At present, there is no regulatory limit for OTA in the United States. However, all of the positive samples were above the maximum level set by the European Commission (0.5 ng/g) for OTA in baby foods. OTA was detected in all types of infant cereals, but the highest incidence and concentrations were found in oat-based infant cereals (59%), followed by mixed grain cereals (34%).

However, the chemical composition, the levels of these saponins in commercial oat products, and their health effects are still largely unknown. In this study, we directly purified 5 steroidal saponins (1-5) from a methanol extract of oat bran, characterized their structures by analyzing their MS and NMR spectra, and also tentatively identified 11 steroidal saponins (6-16) on the basis of their tandem mass spectra (MS(n), n = 2-3). Among the five purified saponins, 5 is a new compound and 4 is purified from oats for the first time. Using HPLC-MS techniques, a complete profile of oat steroidal saponins was determined, and the contents of the two primary steroidal saponins, 1 and 2, were quantitated in 15 different commercial oat products.

26834763,"Graminaceous arabinoxylans are distinguished by decoration with feruloylated monosaccharidic and oligosaccharidic side-chains. Although it is hypothesized that structural complexity and abundance of these feruloylated arabinoxylan side-chains may contribute, among other factors, to resistance of plant cell walls to enzymatic degradation, quantitative profiling approaches for these structural units in plant cell wall materials have not been described yet. Here we report the development and application of a rapid and robust method enabling the quantitative comparison of feruloylated side-chain profiles in cell wall materials following mildly acidic hydrolysis, C18-solid phase extraction (SPE), reduction under aprotic conditions, and liquid chromatography with diode-array detection/mass spectrometry (LC-DAD/MS) separation and detection. The method was applied to the insoluble fiber/cell wall materials isolated from 12 whole grains: wild rice (Zizania aquatica L.), long-grain brown rice (Oryza sativa L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), kamut (Triticum turanicum Jakubz.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), spelt (Triticum spelta L.), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), maize (Zea mays L.), popcorn (Zea mays L. var. everta), oat (Avena sativa L.) (dehulled), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (dehulled), and proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.). Between 51 and 96% of the total esterified monomeric ferulates were represented in the quantified compounds captured in the feruloylated side-chain profiles, which confirms the significance of these structures to the global arabinoxylan structure in terms of quantity. The method provided new structural insights into cereal grain arabinoxylans, in particular, that the structural moiety α-l-galactopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-d-xylopyranosyl-(1→2)-5-O-trans-feruloyl-l-arabinofuranose (FAXG), which had previously only been described in maize, is ubiquitous to cereal grains.

In this study, the distribution of DON in the wheat kernel and the effect of exposure time to ozone on DON detoxification were investigated. A high concentration of toxin was found in the outer part of the kernel, and DON was injected from the outside to the inside. The degradation rates of DON were 26.40%, 39.16%, and 53.48% after the samples were exposed to 75 mg/L ozone for 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively. The effect of ozonation on wheat flour quality and nutrition was also evaluated. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found in protein content, fatty acid value, amino acid content, starch content, carbonyl and carboxyl content, and swelling power of ozone-treated samples. Moreover, the ozone-treated samples exhibited higher tenacity and whiteness, as well as lower extensibility and yellowness. This finding indicated that ozone treatment can simultaneously reduce DON levels and improve flour quality.

The Method Developer evaluation for the validation of the GlutenTox Pro Test Kit (Biomedal Diagnostics, Sevilla, Spain) for the detection of gluten in foods and on surfaces was conducted at Biomedal, S. L., Camas, Sevilla, Spain. The GlutenTox Pro test method was evaluated by testing the following: cross-reactivity, interference, specificity and sensitivity, robustness, stability, lot-to-lot variation, food matrix, and environmental surface. To evaluate the performance of the GlutenToxPro test for the detection of gluten, 10 matrixes were selected: rice flour, bread/biscuit, rolled oat, pâté, and yogurt (and a second bread matrix for incurred sampled testing) for the food matrix study and food-grade painted wood, plastic, rubber, sealed ceramic, and stainless steel for the environmental surface matrix study. For the food matrix study, 30 replicates were evaluated at six spiked levels of gluten (0, 3, 8, 15, 25, and 45 ppm) against four detection thresholds (5, 10, 20, and 40 ppm) for each food matrix. Additionally, 10 replicates were evaluated at a concentration of 10,000 ppm using all four detection thresholds only for rice flour matrix. Three replicates of each concentration level of gluten were analyzed using paired samples by the AOAC OMA 2012.01 reference method for each food matrix. For the environmental surface study, 30 replicates were evaluated at a low spike level of gluten (16 ng/16 cm2), five replicates at a high spike level of gluten (400 ng/16 cm2), and five replicates at an unspiked control level (0 ng/16 cm2) for each surface matrix. Upon completion of testing, the probability of detection values and confidence intervals were calculated and plotted versus the concentration level as determined by the reference method when applicable. An independent laboratory evaluation of the GlutenTox Pro Test Kit with rice flour and stainless steel environmental surface was conducted at Q Laboratories, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH).

Proteins in the oat seed extracts were optimized for their amylolytic activities. Oat extract with amylolytic activity was separated by SDS-PAGE and a major protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa was subjected to tryptic digestion. The generated amino acid sequences were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS) and database searches. These sequences were used to identify a partial cDNA from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of A. sativa L. Based upon EST sequences, a predicted full-length gene was identified, with an open reading frame of 1464 bp encoding a protein of 488 amino acid residues (AsBAMY), with a theoretical molecular mass of 55 kDa identified as a β-amylase belonging to the plant β-amylase family. Primary structure of oat β-amylase (AsBAMY) protein indicated high similarity with other β-amylase from other cereals such as wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and rye (Secale cereale) with two conserved Glu residues (E184 and E378) assigned as the “putative” catalytic residues which would act as an acid and base pair in the catalytic process.

To this aim, unique marker peptides were properly selected in order to distinguish between the different cereal types. A revised cocktail solution based on reducing and denaturing agents was exploited for prolamin extraction from raw and processed food; in addition, defatting with hexane was carried out for sample clean-up, allowing to largely reduce problems related to matrix effect. Method validation on fortified rice flour showed good analytical performance in terms of sensitivity (limits of detection in the 2-18 mg kg(-1) range). However, poor trueness was calculated for self-made incurred bread (between 3 and 30% depending on the peptide), probably due to baking processes, which reduce gluten extractability. Thus, it is evident that in the case of processed foods further insights into sample treatment efficiency and reference materials for protein calibration are required to obtain accurate gluten determination.

29363933,"Mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA) is a widespread contaminant of raw cereal grains with nephrotoxic activity. Сereal-based baby foods (BF) are an important component of the infant diet. In Russia, the presence of OTA in grainbased BF is not allowed (<0.5 ng/kg), in the EU maximum limit of toxin in BF is 0.5 ng/kg. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) set for OTA a provisional tolerable weekly intake of 100 ng/kg bw; the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) – 120 ng/kg bw. The purpose of this study was to investigate the OTA content in BF (infant cereals and canned food) and assess the relevant risk to the health of children first year of life. The analysis of OTA was performed by immunoaffinity column clean-up and high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The limit of detection and limit of quantification for OTA were 0.10 and 0.50 ng/kg, respectively. The content of OTA in BF was represented as maximum (Max), mean (M), median (Мe) and 90 percentile (90%) of all samples. The 554 BF samples based on corn, rice, buckwheat, millet, wheat, oats, barley, and mixtures of cereals were studied. OTA was detected in 32 samples of BF: in 30 of the 312 samples of infant cereals (Max – 4.95 ng/kg; M – 0.09 ng/kg, Me and 90% – 0 ng/kg) and in 2 of the 242 samples of canned food (0.34 and 0.37 ng/kg). 20 samples of BF were contaminated with OTA above the maximum limit (≥0.50 ng/kg). BF, exhibited the highest incidence of OTA, were buckwheat-based (13 of 41 samples, Max – 2.52 ng/kg, M – 0.36 ng/kg, Me – 0 ng/kg, 90% – 1.57 ng/kg) and mixed-grain (12 of 115 samples, Max – 4.95 ng/kg, M – 0.10 ng/kg, Me – 0 ng/kg, 90% – 0.14 ng/kg) infant cereals. OTA was also detected in 2 of 40 samples of oat-based infant cereals (0.19 and 0.60 ng/kg), in 2 of 72 samples of rice-based infant cereals (0.18 and 0.48 ng/kg) and in 1 of 37 samples of wheat-based infant cereals (0.13 ng/kg). None of the 4 samples of corn-based and of the 3 samples of millet-based infant cereals contained OTA. Calculations showed that for infants the daily ochratoxin A dietary intake did not exceed 6.8 ng/kg bw. This value of OTA intake is below the levels, proposed as tolerable intake. Thus, one can conclude that cereal-based BF (infant cereals and canned food) are moderately contaminated with OTA and there is not a significant toxicological risk to the health of children of first year of life.

25520274,"T-2 toxin is a trichothecene mycotoxin produced when Fusarium fungi infect grains, especially oats and wheat. Ingestion of T-2 toxin contaminated grain can cause diarrhea, hemorrhaging, and feed refusal in livestock. Cereal crops infected with mycotoxin-producing fungi form toxin glycosides, sometimes called masked mycotoxins, which are a potential food safety concern because they are not detectable by standard approaches and may be converted back to the parent toxin during digestion or food processing. The work reported here addresses four aspects of T-2 toxin-glucosides: phytotoxicity, stability after ingestion, antibody detection, and the anomericity of the naturally occurring T-2 toxin-glucoside found in cereal plants. T-2 toxin-β-glucoside was chemically synthesized and compared to T-2 toxin-α-glucoside prepared with Blastobotrys muscicola cultures and the T-2 toxin-glucoside found in naturally contaminated oats and wheat. The anomeric forms were separated chromatographically and differ in both NMR and mass spectrometry. Both anomers were significantly degraded to T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin under conditions that mimic human digestion, but with different kinetics and metabolic end products. The naturally occurring T-2 toxin-glucoside from plants was found to be identical to T-2 toxin-α-glucoside prepared with B. muscicola. An antibody test for the detection of T-2 toxin was not effective for the detection of T-2 toxin-α-glucoside. This anomer was produced in sufficient quantity to assess its animal toxicity.

25454134,"Gluten is the collective name for a class of proteins found in wheat, rye, barley and oats. Eating gluten triggers an inappropriate auto-immune reaction in ∼70 million people globally affected by coeliac disease, where the gut reacts to gluten proteins and this triggers an immune response, resulting in intestinal inflammation and damage. Gluten-free foods are now commonplace, however, it is difficult to accurately determine the gluten content of products claiming to be gluten-free using current methodologies as the antibodies are non-specific, show cross-reactivity and have different affinities for the different classes of gluten. The measurement of gluten in processed products is further confounded by modifications to the proteins that occur during processing and in some case hydrolysis of the proteins. In this study, LC-MS/MS was used to profile whole beer, and two beer fractions representing hydrolysed hordeins (<30 kDa) and hordein peptide fragments (<10 kDa). Subsequently, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) MS enabled the relative quantification of selected peptide fragments in beer and revealed that certain classes of hordein were prone to hydrolysis (B- and D-hordein). Furthermore, select beers contained very high levels of gluten-derived fragments. Strikingly, those beers that contained high levels of B-hordein fragments gave near zero values by ELISA. The hydrolysed fragments that persist in beer show a dose-dependent suppression of ELISA measurement of gluten despite using a hordein standard for calibration of the assay. The development of MS-based methodology for absolute quantification of gluten is required for the accurate assessment of gluten, including hydrolysed forms, in food and beverages to support the industry, legislation and to protect consumers suffering from CD.",Journal of chromatography.

On the basis of the well-known softening effect of puroindolines in wheat kernel texture, in this study, indolines and their encoding genes are investigated in Avena species at different ploidy levels. Three novel 14 kDa proteins, showing a central hydrophobic domain with four tryptophan residues and here named vromindoline (VIN)-1,2 and 3, were identified. Each VIN protein in diploid oat species was found to be synthesized by a single Vin gene whereas, in hexaploid A. sativa, three Vin-1, three Vin-2 and two Vin-3 genes coding for VIN-1, VIN-2 and VIN-3, respectively, were described and assigned to the A, C or D genomes based on similarity to their counterparts in diploid species. Expression of oat vromindoline transgenes in the extra-hard durum wheat led to accumulation of vromindolines in the endosperm and caused an approximate 50 % reduction of grain hardness, suggesting a central role for vromindolines in causing the extra-soft texture of oat grain. Further, hexaploid oats showed three orthologous genes coding for avenoindolines A and B, with five or three tryptophan residues, respectively, but very low amounts of avenoindolines were found in mature kernels.

We identified and characterized the relevant peptides for either antibody recognition or immunoactivity in celiac patients. The beer was fractionated by HPLC. The relative reactivity of the different HPLC fractions to the G12/A1 antibodies correlated to the reactivity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 14 celiac individuals. Peptides from representative fractions classified according to the relative reactivity to G12/A1 antibodies were identified by mass spectrometry. The beer peptides containing sequences with similarity to those of previously described G12 and A1 epitopes were synthesized and confirmed significant reactivity for the antibodies. The most reactive peptides for G12/A1 also confirmed the highest immunogenicity by peripheral blood mononuclear cell activation and interferon γ production from celiac patients. We concluded that preparative HPLC combined with anti-gliadin 33-mer G12/A1 antibodies were very sensitive and specific methods to analyze the relevant immunogenic peptides in hydrolyzed gluten.

24866027,"Global and targeted mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches were developed to discover, evaluate, and apply gluten peptide markers to detect low parts per million (ppm) wheat contamination of oats. Prolamins were extracted from wheat, barley, rye, and oat flours and then reduced, alkylated, and digested with chymotrypsin. The resulting peptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis and database matching. No peptide markers common to wheat, barley, and rye were identified that could be used for global gluten detection. However, many grain-specific peptide markers were identified, and a set of these markers was selected for gluten detection and grain differentiation. Wheat flour was spiked into gluten-free oat flour at concentrations of 1-100,000 ppm and analyzed to determine the lowest concentration at which the wheat ""contaminant"" could be confidently detected in the mixture. The same 2D ion trap instrument that was used for the global proteomics approach was used for the targeted proteomics approach, providing a seamless transition from target discovery to application. A powerful, targeted MS/MS method enabled detection of two wheat peptide markers at the 10 ppm wheat flour-in-oat flour concentration. Because gluten comprises approximately 10% of wheat flour protein, the reported wheat gluten-specific peptides can enable detection of approximately 1 ppm of wheat gluten in oats.

A composite of 47% cowpea, 40% ripe banana, and 13% peanut was processed, analyzed to compare the actual nutrient composition to that predicted by the software and that of two popular commercial WFs produced by Gerber Products Company: rice with banana (RB) and oats with banana (OB). Proximate composition was determined by Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods, in vitro digestibility by the pH drop method, and amino acid was determined using high performance liquid chromatography. Essential amino acid values were comparable to the predicted values. Protein and oil contents had values of 16.89% and 8.38%, 6.9% and 1.10%, and 12.03% and 3.16% for WF, RB, and OB, respectively. Octadecenoic (oleic) acid had the highest value of 3.65% followed by octadecadienoic (linoleic) acid with a value of 2.64% amounting to 76.69% of the total fatty acid.

24630057,"Unlike the other fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin K circulates in the human bloodstream at very low levels because of a low intake in the diet. Mammals have developed an efficient recycling system, known as vitamin K-epoxide cycle, which involve quinone, hydroquinone and epoxide forms of the vitamin. Phylloquinone (K(1)) is the main homologue, while menaquinone-4 (MK-4) is both a member of the vitamin K(2) family and metabolite of K(1) in extra-hepatic tissues. Notwithstanding the recent advances, many aspects of the complex vitamin K physiology still remain to be investigated. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop more reliable analytical methods for determining the vitamin K and its metabolites in biological fluids and tissues. Nevertheless, relatively low concentrations, unavailability of some authentic standards and occurrence of interfering lipids make this a challenging task. The method proposed in the present paper can directly and accurately estimate K(1), K(1) 2,3-epoxide (K(1)O), and MK-4 in human serum and plasma at concentrations in the ng/L-μg/L range, using labelled internal standards and a quadrupole linear ion trap instrument operated in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. High sensitivity was achieved by removing signal ""endogenous suppressors"" and making the composition of the non-aqueous mobile phase suitable to support the positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization of the analytes. An excellent selectivity resulted from the combination of some factors: the MRM acquisition, the adoption of an identification point system, an extraction optimized to remove most of the lipids and a tandem-C18 column-system necessary to separate isobaric interferences from analytes. The method was validated according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines and its accuracy was assessed by analysing 9 samples from the Vitamin K External Quality Assessment Scheme (KEQAS). Its feasibility in evaluating vitamin K status in human serum was also tested by monitoring a group of six healthy subjects and a group of six patients under oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT). Warfarinised patients did not show deficiency of K1 but levels comparable with those of healthy people and an accumulation of K1O up to 3.760μg/L.

No residues were found in 77.5% of the samples, 13.75% contained pesticide residues at or below MRLs, and 8.75% above MRLs. The greatest percentage of samples with residues (29%) was noted for wheat, and the lowest for rye (20%). Obtained data were used to estimate potential health risks associated with exposure to these pesticides. The highest estimated daily intakes (EDIs) were as follows: 789% of the ADI for aldrin (wheat) and 49.8% of the ADI for pirimiphos methyl (wheat and rye). The acute risk from aldrin and tebuconazole in wheat was 315.9% and 98.7% ARfD, respectively. The results show that despite the highest EDIs of pesticide residues in cereals, the current situation could not be considered a serious public health problem.

To investigate the presence of toxigenic Fusarium species and their toxins in oats, samples were taken during 2010 and 2011 in three geographical regions of Sweden (east, west, south). The samples were analysed by real-time PCR for the specific infection level of seven Fusarium species associated with oats and other cereals (Fusarium poae, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium langsethiae, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium tricinctum, Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium avenaceum) and with a multi-mycotoxin method based on liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) for the detection of many fungal metabolites, including deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA), nivalenol (NIV), T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxins, moniliformin (MON), beauvericin (BEA) and enniatins (ENNs). Most samples contained at least four of the seven Fusarium species analysed and F. poae, F. langsethiae and F. avenaceum were present in approximately 90-100% of all samples. The most common toxins detected were DON, NIV, BEA and ENNs, which were present in more than 90% of samples. Most Fusarium species and their toxins occurred in higher concentrations in 2010 than in 2011, with the exception of DON and its main producer F. graminearum. Significant regional differences were detected for some moulds and mycotoxins, with higher levels of F. graminearum, DON and ZEA in western Sweden than in the east (P<0.05) and higher levels of F. tricinctum and MON in the south (P<0.05). Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between many Fusarium species and toxin levels. For example, F. tricinctum was significantly correlated to F. avenaceum (r = 0.72, P<0.001), DON to ZEA (r = 0.52, P<0.001), DON to F. graminearum (r = 0.77, P<0.001) and the sum of T-2 and HT-2 to F. langsethiae (r = 0.77, P<0.001).

23812878,"The soluble proteins and protein aggregates in Belinda oats were characterized using asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) coupled with online UV-vis spectroscopy and multiangle light-scattering detection (MALS). Fractions from the AF4 separation were collected and further characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The AF4 fractogram of the oat extracts revealed three peaks which were determined to be monomeric forms of soluble proteins, globulin aggregates, and β-glucan, respectively. The early eluting monomeric proteins ranged in molar mass (MM) between 5 and 90 kg/mol and in hydrodynamic diameter (D h) from 1.6 to 13 nm. The MM at peak maximum of the globulin aggregate peak was found to be ∼300 kg/mol and the D h was measured to be ∼20 nm. SDS-PAGE of the collected fraction across this peak revealed two bands with MM of 37 and 27 kg/mol which correspond to the α and β subunits of globulin indicating the elution of globulin aggregates. A third peak at long retention time was determined to be β-glucan through treatment of the oat extract with β-glucanase and by injection of β-glucan standards. The amount of soluble protein was measured to be 83.1 ± 2.3 wt.%, and the amount of albumin proteins was measured to be 17.6 ± 5.7 wt.% of the total protein in the oats. The results for Belinda oat extracts show that the AF4-MALS/UV platform is capable of characterizing the physicochemical properties such as MM and hydrodynamic size distribution of proteins and protein aggregates within a complicated food matrix environment and without the need to generate protein isolates.

23606126,"Fusarium mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) can occur in cereals conjugated to glucose and probably also to other sugars. These conjugates, which are often referred to as ""masked mycotoxins"", will not be detected with routine analytical techniques. Furthermore, it is suspected that the parent toxin may again be released after hydrolysis in the digestive tracts of animals and humans. Today, our knowledge of the occurrence of these compounds in cereal grains is limited. In this paper, a LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of DON, deoxynivalenol-3-β-D-glucoside (DON-3-glucoside), 3 acetyl-DON, nivalenol, fusarenon-X, diacetoxyscirpenol, HT-2 toxin, and T-2 toxin in naturally (n = 48) and artificially (n = 30) contaminated cereal grains (wheat, barley, oat, rye triticale) is reported. The method has also been applied to whole fresh maize plant intended for production of maize silage (n = 10). The samples were collected from the harvest years 2006-2010, The results show that DON-3-glucoside and DON co-occurred in cereal grains and, especially in several of the highly contaminated samples, the concentration of the glucoside can be relatively high, corresponding to over 37 % of the DON concentration. The DON-3-glucoside levels in both the naturally and in the artificially grain inoculated with Fusarium were second only to DON, and were generally higher than those of the other tested trichothecenes, which were found at low concentrations in most samples, in many cases even below the detection limit of the method. This argues for the importance of taking DON-3-glucoside into account in the ongoing discussion within the European Community concerning exposure re-evaluations for setting changed values for the tolerable intake for DON. Our results indicate that, in the naturally contaminated grains and in the Fusarium infested cereal grains (winter and spring wheat, oat, triticale), the concentration level of DON-3-glucoside is positively correlated to the DON content. When the DON concentration is high, then the content of DON-3-glucoside will most probably also be high and vice versa.",Mycotoxin research,"['D018554', 'D002853', 'D003718', 'D002523', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D005670', 'D005960', 'D001467', 'D013058', 'D012434', 'D014255', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Avena', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Denmark', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fusarium', 'Glucosides', 'Hordeum', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Secale', 'Trichothecenes', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Occurrence of different trichothecenes and deoxynivalenol-3-β-D-glucoside in naturally and artificially contaminated Danish cereal grains and whole maize plants.,"['Q000382', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000032', 'Q000382', 'Q000737']","['microbiology', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'microbiology', None, 'microbiology', 'analysis', 'microbiology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23606126,2013

Kjeldahl determination, phenol-sulfuric acid method, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis indicated that the enzymatic products of oat bran contain a protein amount of 71.93%, of which 97.43% are peptides with a molecular range from 438.56 to 1301.01 Da.

Pre-incubation of human dermal fibroblasts with the Oatp for 24 h markedly inhibited human dermal fibroblast injury induced by H(2)O(2), but application oat peptides with H(2)O(2) at same time did not. Pre-treatment of human dermal fibroblasts with Oatp significantly reversed the H(2)O(2)-induced decrease of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the inhibition of malondialdehyde (MDA). The results demonstrate that oat peptides possess antioxidant activity and are effective against H(2)O(2)-induced human dermal fibroblast injury by the enhanced activity of SOD and decrease in MDA level.

The UPLC method proved fast and sensitive for determining seven folate monoglutamates in cereal samples. Folate content in fractions, which are normally discarded, such as flour from oat cutting and flaking, were 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher than in native grain.

In this work, an alkaline and thermally stable cellulase-less xylanase, derived from a xylanolytic Bacillus subtilis, has been purified by a combination of gel filtration and Q-Sepharose chromatography to its homogeneity. Molecular weight of the purified xylanase was 61 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme revealed an optimum assay temperature and pH of 60°C and 8.0, respectively. Xylanase was active in the pH range of 6.0-9.0 and stable up to 70°C.

22794797,"This article describes a substantially improved multi-residue method for the determination of a large number of pesticides in cereal samples (wheat, rye, barley, oats, maze, buckwheat etc.) and various animal feeds. The sample preparation method and the GC-MS/MS acquisition method were modified to accommodate new complex cereal and feed matrices and to extend the existing analytical scope to 167 pesticides. The co-extractives were reduced by the joint use of primary secondary amine (PSA) and octadecyl (C18), 75 mg and 50 mg/1 mL of acetonitrile extract, in the presence of MgSO(4), and thus the optimal recovery and analytical selectivity were obtained simultaneously. The new cleanup procedure was faster and easier to handle than our previously applied cleanup procedure. The overall recoveries of the pesticides from buckwheat and rye at the three spiking levels of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.25 mg kg(-1) were 96 ± 9% with relative standard deviations of 10 ± 4% on average. At the lowest spiking level of 0.01 mg kg(-1), 137 of 167 pesticide residues (82%) fulfilled the validation criteria with recoveries in the range of 70-120% and RSDs less or equal 20% whereas in the previous approach it was 93 out of 140 analytes (66%). The developed method was implemented in a routine analysis of approximately 900 real samples, providing an increased scope of the analysis, improved analytical performance parameters and improved ruggedness versus the previous approach.

The (15)N(3)-labeled enniatins and beauvericin were biosynthesized by feeding two Fusarium strains Na(15)NO(3) and subsequently isolated from the fungal culture. The chemical structures of the biosynthesized products were characterized by LC-MS/MS and (1)H NMR. Standard solutions of (15)N(3)-labeled beauvericin, enniatin A, and enniatin A1 were accurately quantitated by quantitative NMR. On the basis of the use of the labeled products as internal standards, stable isotope dilution assays were developed and applied to various food samples using LC-MS/MS. The sample extracts were directly injected without any tedious cleanup procedures. The limits of detection were 3.9, 2.6, 3.7, 1.9, and 4.4 μg/kg for enniatins A, A1, B, and B1 and beauvericin, respectively.

22689622,"The presence of glucoside derivatives of T-2 and HT-2 toxins (type A trichothecene mycotoxins) in naturally contaminated wheat and oats is reported for the first time. The use of advanced high-resolution mass spectrometry based on Orbitrap technology allowed to obtain molecular structure details by measuring exact masses of main characteristic fragments, with mass accuracy lower than 2.8 ppm (absolute value). A monoglucoside derivative of T-2 toxin and two monoglucoside derivatives of HT-2 toxin were identified and characterized. The analysis of their fragmentation patterns provided evidence for glucosylation at C-3 position for T-2 toxin and at C-3 or C-4 position for HT-2 toxin. A screening for the presence of these new masked forms of mycotoxins was carried out on a set of naturally contaminated wheat and oats samples. On the basis of peak area ratio between glucoside derivatives and free T-2 and HT-2 toxins, the presence of glucoside derivatives was more likely in wheat than in oats samples. The present work confirms the widespread occurrence of trichothecene glucosides in cereal grains naturally contaminated with the relevant unconjugated toxins, thus suggesting the importance of developing suitable analytical methods for their detection.

HT-2 and T-2 toxins were separated and quantified by UPLC with photodiode array (PDA) detector (λ=202 nm) in less than 5 min. Mean recoveries from blank oats samples spiked with HT-2 and T-2 toxins at levels of 50-1000 μg kg(-1) ranged from 87 to 96%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 7%; mean recoveries from wheat spiked with HT-2 and T-2 toxins at levels of 25-100 μg kg(-1) ranged from 91 to 103%, with RSDs lower than 5%.

The method involves an alkaline hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide in order to release covalently bound compounds, prior to QuEChERS extraction, followed by neutralization and analysis via liquid chromatography-double mass spectrometry LC/MS/MS. The performance of the method either with or without alkaline hydrolysis was studied in terms of recovery rates and limit of quantification (LOQ). In either case, recoveries were determined at four spiking levels (0.02 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg) with 5 replicates for each level. Mean recoveries ranged from 90 to 120 %, whereas relative standard deviations (RSD %) proved to be less than 20 %. Quantitative analysis was carried out by the internal standard (Nicarbazin) and the LC/MS/MS analysis was performed in electrospray ionisation (ESI) negative mode using a Zorbax XCB Eclipse column. The developed method was applied to the analysis of several cereals commercially available like as rye flour, oat meal, oat flakes and dehusked oat. Residue levels were found below the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method.

Samples were extracted with a mixture of acetonitrile/water (84:16, v/v) and cleaned up through a polymeric solid-phase extraction column. Detection and quantification of the nine mycotoxins were performed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS), using fully (13)C-isotope-labelled mycotoxins as internal standards. The method was validated in-house for five different cereal processed products, namely barley, oat and durum wheat flours, rye- and wheat-based crisp bread. Recoveries and repeatability of the whole analytical procedure were evaluated at contamination levels encompassing the EU maximum permitted levels for each tested mycotoxin. Recoveries ranged from 89 to 108% for deoxynivalenol, from 73 to 114% for aflatoxins, from 85 to 114% for T-2 and HT-2 toxins, from 64 to 97% for zearalenone, from 74 to 102% for ochratoxin A. Relative standard deviations were less than 16% for all tested mycotoxins and matrices. Limits of detection (signal-to-noise ratio 3:1) ranged from 0.1 to 59.2 µg/kg. The trueness of the results obtained by the proposed method was demonstrated by analysis of reference materials for aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone.

A number of recently conducted studies reported emissions data from different dairy sources. However, limited data are currently available for silage and otherfeed storages on dairies, which could potentially contribute to ozone formation. Because the impact of different VOCs on ozone formation varies significantly from one molecular species to another, detailed characterization of VOC emissions is essential to include all the important contributors to atmospheric chemistry and especially atmospheric reactivity. The present research study identifies and quantifies the VOCs emitted from various silages and other feedstuffs. Experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber under controlled conditions. Almost 80 VOCs were identified and quantified from corn (Zea mays L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.),and cereal (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] and oat [Avena sativava L.] grains) silages, total mixed ration (TMR), almond (Amygdalus communis L.) shells and hulls using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography.

21329430,"Owing to its extensive use in the human diet, wheat is among the most common causes of food-related allergies and intolerances. Allergies to wheat are provoked by ingestion, inhalation or contact with either the soluble or the insoluble gluten proteins in wheat. Gluten proteins, and particularly the gliadin fraction, are also the main factor triggering celiac disease, a common enteropathy induced by ingestion of wheat gluten proteins and related prolamins from oat, rye and barley in genetically susceptible individuals. The role of gliadin and of its derived peptides in eliciting the adverse reactions in celiac disease are still far from being completely explained. Owing to its unique pathogenesis, celiac disease is widely investigated as a model immunogenetic disorder. The structural characterization of the injuring agents, the gluten proteins, assumes a particular significance in order to deepen the understanding of the events that trigger this and similar diseases at the molecular level. Recent developments in proteomics have provided an important contribution to the understanding of several basic aspects of wheat protein-related diseases. These include: the identification of gluten fractions and derived peptides involved in wheat allergy and intolerance, including celiac disease, and the elucidation of their mechanism of toxicity; the development and validation of sensitive and specific methods for detecting trace amounts of gluten proteins in gluten-free foods for intolerant patients; and the formulation of completely new substitute foods and ingredients to replace the gluten-based ones. In this article, the main aspects of current and prospective applications of mass spectrometry and proteomic technologies to the structural characterization of gluten proteins and derived peptides are critically presented, with a focus on issues related to their detection, identification and quantification, which are relevant to the biochemical, immunological and toxicological aspects of wheat intolerance.",Expert review of proteomics,"['D000485', 'D002446', 'D005903', 'D005983', 'D006801', 'D055315', 'D040901', 'D014908', 'D021182']","['Allergens', 'Celiac Disease', 'Gliadin', 'Glutens', 'Humans', 'Prolamins', 'Proteomics', 'Triticum', 'Wheat Hypersensitivity']",Proteomic analysis in allergy and intolerance to wheat products.,"['Q000145', 'Q000175', 'Q000009', 'Q000009', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000009', 'Q000175']","['classification', 'diagnosis', 'adverse effects', 'adverse effects', None, 'analysis', None, 'adverse effects', 'diagnosis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21329430,2011

21244849,"Flavonoids are conjugated by phase II enzymes in humans to form glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites that are excreted in urine via the kidney. In this study, we examined the interaction between metabolites of quercetin and isoflavonoids found in vivo with human organic anion transporters 1 (OAT1) and 3 (OAT3) and their potential in attenuating OAT-induced cytotoxicity of adefovir. Accumulation of flavonoid conjugates was studied in human embryonic kidney 293H cells overexpressing OAT1 or OAT3. OAT1-overexpressing cells exhibited an increased uptake of the sulfated conjugates, genistein-4'-O-sulfate and quercetin-3'-O-sulfate. OAT3-overexpressing cells demonstrated enhanced uptake of glucuronide conjugates, such as daidzein-7-O-glucuronide, genistein-7-O-glucuronide, glycitein-7-O-glucuronide and quercetin-3'-O-glucuronide. Position of conjugation was important since quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and quercetin-7-O-glucuronide were poorly transported. Kinetic analysis revealed high affinity uptake of quercetin-3'-O-sulfate by OAT1 (K(m)=1.73μM; V(max)=105 pmol/min/mg). OAT3 transported isoflavone glucuronides with lower affinity (K(m)=7.9-19.1 μM) but with higher V(max) (171-420 pmol/min/mg). Quercetin-3'-O-sulfate strongly inhibited OAT1-mediated p-aminohippuric acid uptake with an IC(50) of 1.22μM. Transport of 5-carboxyfluorescein by OAT3 was potently inhibited by quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, quercetin-3'-O-glucuronide and quercetin-3'-O-sulfate (IC(50)=0.43-1.31μM). In addition, quercetin-3'-O-sulfate was shown to effectively reduce OAT1-mediated cytotoxicity of adefovir, an antiviral drug, in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that OAT1 and OAT3 are responsible for basolateral uptake of flavonoid conjugates in kidney, and flavonoid conjugates inhibit OAT1 and OAT3 activity at physiologically relevant concentrations.

21169440,"Severe intoxications caused by the Bacillus cereus emetic toxin cereulide can hardly be prevented due to the ubiquitous distribution and heat resistance of spores and the extreme thermal and chemical stability of cereulide. It would therefore be desirable to inhibit cereulide synthesis during food manufacturing processes or in prepared foods, which are stored under time-temperature abuse conditions. Toward this end, the impacts of three long-chain polyphosphate (polyP) formulations on growth and cereulide production were examined. The inhibition was dependent on the concentration and the type of the polyP blend, indicating that polyPs and not the orthophosphates were effective. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) monitoring at sublethal concentrations revealed that polyPs reduced the transcription of ces nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes by 3- to 4-fold along with a significantly reduced toxin production level. At lower concentrations, toxin synthesis was decreased, although the growth rate was not affected. These data indicate a differential effect on toxin synthesis independent of growth inhibition. The inhibition of toxin synthesis in food was also observed. Despite the growth of B. cereus, toxin synthesis was reduced by 70 to 100% in two model food systems (reconstituted infant food and oat milk), which were analyzed with HEp-2 cell culture assays and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrospray ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS). Accordingly, ces promoter activity was strongly downregulated, as visualized by using a lux-based reporter strain.

In this paper, results are presented of the analysis of volatile compounds in five cereal grain species (spring wheat, durum wheat, triticale, rye, oats and barley) based on representative sampling of at least 15 cultivars of individual species. Profiles of volatile compounds were determined using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and GC-TOF (time of flight mass spectrometry). Many of the volatile compounds were only present in single samples; however, several dozen were found in over 50% of samples and 46 volatiles were found in all samples. Among them there were six alcohols, 10 aldehydes and ketones, six terpenes, seven hydrocarbons and 11 benzene derivatives.

The prebiotic potential of whole grains may be related, however, little is known about the microbiota modulatory capability of oat grain or the impact processing has on this ability. In this study the fermentation profile of whole grain oat flakes, processed to produce two different sized flakes (small and large), by human faecal microbiota was investigated in vitro. Simulated digestion and subsequent fermentation by gut bacteria was investigated using pH controlled faecal batch cultures inoculated with human faecal slurry. The different sized oat flakes, Oat 23's (0.53-0.63 mm) and Oat 25's/26's (0.85-1.0 mm) were compared to oligofructose, a confirmed prebiotic, and cellulose, a poorly fermented carbohydrate. Bacterial enumeration was carried out using the culture independent technique, fluorescent in situ hybridisation, and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production monitored by gas chromatography. Significant changes in total bacterial populations were observed after 24 h incubation for all substrates except Oat 23's and cellulose. Oats 23's fermentation resulted in a significant increase in the Bacteroides-Prevotella group. Oligofructose and Oats 25's/26's produced significant increases in Bifidobacterium in the latter stages of fermentation while numbers declined for Oats 23's between 5 h and 24 h. This is possibly due to the smaller surface area of the larger flakes inhibiting the simulated digestion, which may have resulted in increased levels of resistant starch (Bifidobacterium are known to ferment this dietary fibre). Fermentation of Oat 25's/26's resulted in a propionate rich SCFA profile and a significant increase in butyrate, which have both been linked to benefiting host health. The smaller sized oats did not produce a significant increase in butyrate concentration.

20560983,"Currently the only treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet excluding food products containing wheat, rye and barley. There is, however, only scarce evidence as to harmful effects of rye in coeliac disease. To confirm the assumption that rye should be excluded from the coeliac patient's diet, we now sought to establish whether rye secalin activates toxic reactions in vitro in intestinal epithelial cell models as extensively as wheat gliadin. Further, we investigated the efficacy of germinating cereal enzymes from oat, wheat and barley to hydrolyse secalin into short fragments and whether secalin-induced harmful effects can be reduced by such pretreatment. In the current study, secalin elicited toxic reactions in intestinal Caco-2 epithelial cells similarly to gliadin: it induced epithelial cell layer permeability, tight junctional protein occludin and ZO-1 distortion and actin reorganization. In high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS), germinating barley enzymes provided the most efficient degradation of secalin and gliadin peptides and was thus selected for further in vitro analysis. After germinating barley enzyme pretreatment, all toxic reactions induced by secalin were ameliorated. We conclude that germinating enzymes from barley are particularly efficient in the degradation of rye secalin.

In the near future, maximum levels for these trichothecenes will be regulated by the European Commission as announced in EU (VO) 1881/2006. For the implementation of these maximum levels, more data on occurrence and behaviour of T-2 and HT-2 toxins in primary agricultural products as well as during cleaning treatment and food processing are needed. In the current work, we determined the T-2/HT-2 concentrations in four oat cultivars (Aragon, Dominik, Ivory, Pergamon) from ten different agricultural sites in Germany, grown in cultivar studies in 2007. The grains were de-hulled, oat meal was prepared, and bread with 20% oat meal and 80% wheat flour was baked. In the cereal-processing chain, samples were taken at various steps and subsequently analysed for their T-2/HT-2 content. We employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and an immunological screening method (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA)) for T-2/HT-2 determination. Detection limits were between 1 and 10 microg kg(-1) in different matrices. T-2/HT-2 concentrations determined by ELISA in oat samples from ten different agricultural sites in Germany were between 9 and 623 microg kg(-1). The median and 90th percentile were 48 and 191 microg kg(-1) T-2/HT-2, respectively. One site showed six times higher T-2/HT-2 levels than the other sites, where concentrations ranged from 322 to 623 microg kg(-1). In 80% of the samples the cultivars Pergamon and Ivory had the lowest concentration of T-2 and HT-2 toxins. Using LC-MS for T-2/HT-2 determination, cleaning of the raw material did not lead to significant reductions of T-2 and HT-2 levels, whereas de-hulling led to a reduction of over 90%. Boiling of oat meal produced from cleaned raw material to yield 'porridge' resulted in varying T-2/HT-2 levels in experimental replicates. No major reduction of T-2/HT-2 levels in cooked porridge was obtained. Standardized baking experiments using 20% oat meal showed that T-2 and HT-2 toxins are relatively stable during the baking process, probably due to their temperature stability.","Food additives & contaminants.

The performance of the MIP throughout the clean-up of spiked maize, barley and oat sample extracts was compared with the results obtained when using non-imprinted polymer, OASIS HLB and immunoaffinity columns (IAC). Depending on the food matrix and the spiked concentration, recoveries after MISPE and non-imprinted solid-phase extraction varied respectively from 60% to 73% and from 21% to 57%. Recoveries obtained after clean-up using OASIS HLB and IAC were in the range of 74-104% and 60-85%, respectively. Although highest recoveries were obtained with OASIS HLB sorbents, the designed MIP and the IAC were superior regarding selectivity, cross-reactivity, matrix effect, limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ). Depending on the matrix, LOD after MISPE ranged from 0.4 microg/kg to 0.6 microg/kg and LOQ from 1.4 microg/kg to 1.9 microg/kg. LOD and LOQ after OASIS HLB clean-up varied from 0.9 microg/kg to 3.5 microg/kg and from 3.1 microg/kg to 11.7 microg/kg, respectively. The LOD and LOQ values obtained with IAC were in the range of 0.3-2.3 microg/kg and 1.0-7.7 microg/kg, respectively.

20028018,"The QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) sample preparation method was modified to accommodate various cereal grain matrices (corn, oat, rice, and wheat) and provide good analytical results (recoveries in the range of 70-120% and RSDs <20%) for the majority of the target pesticides (about 180 analytes). The method consists of a 1 h shaking of a milled sample (2.5-5 g) in 20 mL of 1:1 (v/v) water/acetonitrile (or 25 mL of 1.5:1 water/acetonitrile in the case of rice) to provide simultaneous matrix swelling and analyte extraction. Then, a MgSO(4)/NaCl salt mixture (4:1, w/w) is added to the extract to induce phase separation and force the pesticides into the upper acetonitrile layer, a 1 mL aliquot of which is subsequently cleaned up using dispersive solid phase extraction with 150 mg of PSA, 50 mg of C(18), and 150 mg of MgSO(4). GC-amenable pesticides were analyzed using gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and the automated direct sample introduction technique for a large volume injection of the extracts. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was employed for the analysis of LC-amenable pesticides. This method was implemented in a routine laboratory, providing about 3-fold increased sample throughput, 40-50% reduction in the cost of disposable materials and in the operation costs, 1:100 solvent waste reduction, and increased scope of the analysis versus the traditional approach based on the Luke method.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001322', 'D005591', 'D002853', 'D002523', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D010573', 'D015203', 'D053719']","['Autoanalysis', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Pesticide multiresidue analysis in cereal grains using modified QuEChERS method combined with automated direct sample introduction GC-TOFMS and UPLC-MS/MS techniques.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379']","[None, 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20028018,2010

19723227,"Consumers occasionally report greenish colors generated in their oat products when cooking in tap water. Here we have investigated pH and ferrous (Fe(2+)) ion as possible mechanisms for this color change. Steel-cut oat groats can turn brown-green color when cooked in alkaline conditions (pHs 9 to 12). Extraction of this color with methanol, and high-pressure liquid chromatography indicated a direct association of this color with the phenolic acid or avenanthramide content of the oat. The presence of 50 mM NaHCO(3) in water will cause oat/water mixtures to turn alkaline when cooked as CO(2) is driven off, generating OH(-) ion. Although tap water rarely, if ever, contains so much bicarbonate, bicarbonate is used as a leavening agent in baking applications. Industrial interests using baking soda or alkaline conditions during oat processing should be aware of possible off color generation. We have also found that as little as 10 ppm Fe(2+) will turn oat products gray-green when cooked. The aleurone stained darker than the starchy endosperm. Other divalent cations, such as Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) had no effect on cooked oat color. As much as 50 ppm Fe(2+) may be found in freshly pumped well water, but Fe(2+) reacts quickly with oxygen and precipitates as Fe(OH)(3).

In all, 28 winter rye, 73 spring wheat, and 55 spring oat samples were analyzed, representing 6, 9, and 5 cultivars, respectively. The total lignan content showed huge variations within the same cereal species: the range was 2500-6700 microg/100 g in the rye samples, 340-2270 microg/100 g in the wheat samples, and 820-2550 microg/100 g in the oat samples. The variations seemed to depend largely upon genetic differences. In rye, also environmental conditions affected the lignan content through grain size; smaller grains had significantly lower total lignan, syringaresinol, and lariciresinol content than larger grains.

19493973,"Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4B is known to interact with multiple initiation factors, mRNA, rRNA, and poly(A) binding protein (PABP). To gain a better understanding of the function of eIF4B, the two isoforms from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were expressed and analyzed using biophysical and biochemical methods. Plant eIF4B was found by ultracentrifugation and light scattering analysis to most likely be a monomer with an extended structure. An extended structure would facilitate the multiple interactions of eIF4B with mRNA as well as other initiation factors (eIF4A, eIF4G, PABP, and eIF3). Eight mRNAs, barley (Hordeum vulgare) alpha-amylase mRNA, rabbit beta-hemoglobin mRNA, Arabidopsis heat shock protein 21 (HSP21) mRNA, oat (Avena sativa) globulin, wheat (Triticum aestivum) germin, maize (Zea mays) alcohol dehydrogenase, satellite tobacco necrosis virus RNA, and alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) 4, were used in wheat germ in vitro translation assays to measure their dependence on eIF4B and eIF4F isoforms. The two Arabidopsis eIF4B isoforms, as well as native and recombinant wheat eIF4B, showed similar responses in the translation assay. AMV RNA 4 and Arabidopsis HSP21 showed only a slight dependence on the presence of eIF4B isoforms, whereas rabbit beta-hemoglobin mRNA and wheat germin mRNA showed modest dependence. Barley alpha-amylase, oat globulin, and satellite tobacco necrosis virus RNA displayed the strongest dependence on eIF4B. These results suggest that eIF4B has some effects on mRNA discrimination during initiation of translation. Barley alpha-amylase, oat globulin, and rabbit beta-hemoglobin mRNA showed the highest activity with eIF4F, whereas Arabidopsis HSP21 and AMV RNA 4 used both eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F equally well. These results suggest that differential or optimal translation of mRNAs may require initiation complexes composed of specific isoforms of initiation factor gene products. Thus, individual mRNAs or classes of mRNAs may respond to the relative abundance of a particular initiation factor(s), which in turn may affect the amount of protein translated. It is likely that optimal multifactor initiation complexes exist that allow for optimal translation of mRNAs under a variety of cellular conditions.",Plant physiology,"['D000906', 'D017360', 'D001681', 'D015153', 'D002850', 'D003001', 'D004591', 'D039562', 'D039642', 'D014644', 'D008027', 'D008970', 'D014176', 'D020033', 'D012333', 'D012542', 'D016415', 'D014908', 'D014461']","['Antibodies', 'Arabidopsis', 'Biological Assay', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'Genetic Variation', 'Light', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Triticum', 'Ultracentrifugation']","Evidence for variation in the optimal translation initiation complex: plant eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF(iso)4F differentially promote translation of mRNAs.","[None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000276', None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'immunology', None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'genetics', None, None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19493973,2009

Toxins were extracted from the samples with acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v) 0.1% HCOOH and, after a two-fold dilution with water, directly injected into the system. Thanks to the fast high-resolution separation of UHPLC, the eleven mycotoxins were separated by gradient elution in only 4 min. The method has been validated in three food matrices (maize kernels, dry pasta (wheat), and eight-multicereal babyfood (wheat, maize, rice, oat, barley, rye, sorghum, millet)) at four different concentration levels. Satisfactory recoveries were obtained (70-110%) and precision (expressed as relative standard deviation) was typically below 15% with very few exceptions. Quantification of samples was carried out with matrix-matched standards calibration. The lowest concentration successfully validated in sample was as low as 0.5 microg/kg for aflatoxins and ochratoxin A in babyfood, and 20 microg/kg for the rest of the selected mycotoxins in all matrices tested. Deoxynivalenol could be only validated at 200 microg/kg, due the poor sensitivity for this mycotoxin analysis.

Oat (Avena sativa) seed extracts exhibited a high degree of antifungal activity and could be used directly on rye bread to prevent the formation of P. roqueforti colonies. Proteins in the oat seed extracts were fractionated by column chromatography and proteins in fractions containing antifungal activity were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and database searches. Identified antifungal candidates included thaumatin-like proteins, 1,3-beta-glucanase, permatin precursor, pathogenesis-related protein type 1, and chitinases of class I and II. Class I chitinase could be specifically removed from the extracts and was found to be indispensable for 50% of the P. roqueforti inhibiting activity. The purified class I chitinase has a molecular weight of approximately 34 kDa, optimal chitinase activity at pH 7, and exists as at least two basic isoforms (pI values of 7.6 and 8.0). Partial sequencing of the class I chitinase isoforms by LC-MS/MS revealed a primary structure with high similarity to class I chitinases of wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and rye (Secale cereale). Oat, wheat, barley, and rye seed extracts were compared with respect to the abundance of the class I chitinase and decrease in antifungal activity when class I chitinase is removed. We found that the oat seed class I chitinase is at least ten times more abundant than the wheat, barley, and rye homologs and that oat seed extracts are highly active toward P. roqueforti as opposed to extracts of other cereal seeds.",Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,"['D000595', 'D000935', 'D018554', 'D055162', 'D001939', 'D002688', 'D005520', 'D001467', 'D008826', 'D008969', 'D010407', 'D010936', 'D012434', 'D012639', 'D016415', 'D014908']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Avena', 'Biocatalysis', 'Bread', 'Chitinases', 'Food Preservatives', 'Hordeum', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Penicillium', 'Plant Extracts', 'Secale', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Triticum']",Oat (Avena sativa) seed extract as an antifungal food preservative through the catalytic activity of a highly abundant class I chitinase.,"[None, 'Q000302', 'Q000201', 'Q000187', 'Q000382', 'Q000737', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000187']","[None, 'isolation & purification', 'enzymology', 'drug effects', 'microbiology', 'chemistry', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', None, None, 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', 'enzymology', None, 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19224400,2010

PAHs occur as complex mixtures, never as individual components. They are chemically stable and highly lipophilic in nature and occur as contaminants in different food categories: vegetables, fruit, cereals, oils and fats, especially barbecued and smoked food. The present study was carried out to determine 16 PAHs in cereal products: musli, corn, oats and barley flakes, and crunchy. The analytical procedure was based on alkaline digestion, extraction with n-hexane and cleaned up in a florisil cartridge. Chromatographic separation was performed using gas chromatography (HP 6890) coupled to mass spectrometry (HP 5973). The levels of PAHs in most samples were generally low and excepting one sample of bred varied between 4.2 to 169 microg/kg.

19112561,"Within the scope of a joint project to study soil-to-plant carryover of polyfluorinated compounds (PFCs), five cultivated plants (spring wheat, oats, potatoes, maize, and perennial ryegrass) were sown or planted in Mitscherlich pots. Six variants per species were used, each with a different concentration level of PFOA and PFOS (from 0.25 to 50 mg/kg as aqueous solution) to detect possible concentration dependence in the transfer of these two PFCs from soil to plant. PFOA and PFOS were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after appropriate sample preparation (partial drying, mincing, homogenizing, extraction). Since PFOA and PFOS presently represent the most widely studied PFCs, they are classified as ""leading compounds."" The results show that concentrations of PFOA/PFOS in the plants vary greatly, depending on the concentrations applied to the soil. PFOA values were higher than PFOS values in all plants except potatoes, in which these differences could be quite substantial. From the results presented here it can be seen that uptake and storage are much more intensive in the vegetative portion of the plant than relocation in the storage organs. This is particularly evident from the the comparison of concentrations found in the grain and ear and those in the straw or rest of the plant in spring wheat, oats, and maize. Transfer from ""soil to crops"" provides a possible explanation for the presence of PFCs in foodstuffs and in human body fluids such as blood, plasma, serum, or breast milk. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a statistically significant, concentration-dependent carryover of PFOA and PFOS in crop plants can take place, which would provide a potential entrance point for these substances into the food chain.",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D017738', 'D000821', 'D002210', 'D002851', 'D005466', 'D005504', 'D063245', 'D010944', 'D012987', 'D053719']","['Alkanesulfonic Acids', 'Animal Feed', 'Caprylates', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Food Analysis', 'Plant Development', 'Plants', 'Soil', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Carryover of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) from soil to plants.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19112561,2009

This study evaluated the factors that may lead to drug-drug interactions between emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir (TFV), and efavirenz (EFV), including the modulation of efflux transporter expression and function. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were used to determine whether or not an interaction between antiretroviral drugs and target cells occurred in any combination of FTC, TFV, EFV, FTC-TFV, TFV-EFV, or FTC-TFV-EFV. Following 20 h of treatment, intracellular drug concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Efflux transporter functionality and inhibitor drug properties were assessed by measuring fluorescent dye efflux. ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABCC 1 to 6 (multidrug resistance-associated protein), and OAT (organic anion transporter) expression in response to the treatments was quantified by semiquantitative real-time PCR. Cells treated with a double combination (FTC-TFV or TFV-EFV) or the triple combination (FTC-TFV-EFV) produced higher FTC and TFV intracellular concentrations than cells treated with FTC or TFV alone. However, no change in the EFV intracellular concentration was observed. FTC tended to induce abcc5 mRNA expression and EFV tended to induce abcc1 and abcc6 mRNA expression, whereas TFV tended to reduce mdr1, abcc1, abcc5, and abcc6 mRNA expression. Under these conditions, a decrease in the functionality of ABCC was observed, and this decrease was associated with the direct inhibitory actions of these drugs. This in vitro study reveals a benefit of the combination FTC-TFV-EFV in terms of the intracellular FTC and TFV concentrations and highlights the pharmacological mechanisms that lead to this effect.",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"['D020168', 'D018528', 'D000225', 'D000480', 'D000998', 'D048588', 'D002478', 'D003521', 'D003841', 'D004347', 'D004359', 'D000068679', 'D005452', 'D005456', 'D006801', 'D007963', 'D063065', 'D012333', 'D000068698', 'D013997']","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Adenine', 'Alkynes', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benzoxazines', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclopropanes', 'Deoxycytidine', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Emtricitabine', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Organophosphonates', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Tenofovir', 'Time Factors']",Combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine plus efavirenz: in vitro modulation of ABC transporter and intracellular drug accumulation.,"['Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000031', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None]","['genetics', 'genetics', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'genetics', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19075072,2009
18804601,"In this paper is proposed a simultaneous pre-concentration procedure using cloud point extraction for the determination of copper and zinc in food samples employing sequential multi-element flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FS-FAAS). The reagent used is 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN) and the micellar phase is obtained using the non-ionic surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-114) and centrifugation. The optimization step was performed using Box-Behnken design for three factors: solution pH, reagent concentration and buffer concentration. A multiple response function was established in order to get an experimental condition for simultaneous extraction of copper and zinc. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the method allows the determination of copper with a limit of detection (3sigma(b)/S, LOD) of 0.1 microg L(-1), precision expressed as relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 2.1 and 1.3% (N=10), for copper concentrations of 10 and 50 microg L(-1), respectively. Zinc is determined with a LOD of 0.15 microg L(-1) and precision as R.S.D. of 2.7 and 1.7% for concentrations of 10 and 50 microg L(-1), respectively. The enhancement factors obtained were 36 and 32 for copper and zinc, respectively.

16939307,"The first stable isotope dilution assay (SIDA) for the simultaneous quantitation of the most abundant type A trichothecenes in foods and feeds was developed. Synthesis of carbon-13-labeled T2-toxin, HT2-toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol, and monoacetoxyscirpenol was accomplished by [13C2]-acetylation of T2-triol and scirpentriol, respectively. Scirpentriol was prepared from diacetoxyscirpenol by complete alkaline hydrolysis and subsequently was converted to [13C6]-triacetoxyscirpentriol by peracetylation with [13C4]-acetic anhydride. The latter compound was selectively hydrolyzed using ammonium hydroxide to give [13C4]-diacetoxyscirpenol and [13C2]-monoacetoxyscirpenol in reasonable yields. Analogously, [13C6]-T2-triacetate was prepared from T2-triol and subjected to controlled hydrolysis to yield [13C4]-T2-toxin and [13C2]-HT2-toxin. All synthesized products were characterized by NMR and MS experiments. Using the prepared isotopically labeled standards, SIDAs were developed for the quantitation of type A trichothecenes in food and feeds. The mycotoxins were quantified by LC-single and tandem MS after cleanup on multifunctional columns. The method revealed good sensitivity with low detection and quantification limits along with excellent recovery and good precision in interassay studies.

The method was based on appraisal of the GC-MS and LC-MS-MS characteristics of 660 pesticides, their efficiency of extraction from grain, and their purification. Samples of grain (10 g) were mixed with Celite 545 (10 g) and the mixture was placed in a 34-mL cell of an accelerated solvent extractor and extracted with acetonitrile in the static state for 3 min with two cycles at 1,500 psig and at 80 degrees C. For the 362 pesticides determined by GC-MS, half of the extracts were cleaned with an Envi-18 cartridge and then further cleaned with Envi-Carb and Sep-Pak NH2 cartridges in series. The pesticides were eluted with acetonitrile-toluene, 3:1, and the eluates were concentrated and used for analysis after being exchanged with hexane twice.

In the present study, the role of melatonin as a growth promoter is extended to coleoptiles of canary grass, wheat, barley and oat, in which it shows a relative auxinic activity [with respect to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the main auxin in plants] of between 10 and 55%. In addition, melatonin is seen to have an important inhibitory growth effect on roots similar to that played by auxin. The quantitation by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and identification by tandem mass spectrometry of melatonin and IAA in etiolated coleoptiles of the monocots assayed showed that both compounds are present in similar levels in these tissues.

This work reports a fast, sensitive, and selective procedure for the extraction and determination of carotenoids from cereals and cereal byproducts. The method involves sample saponification and extraction followed by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, allowing the separation of the main carotenoids pigments of cereals, especially lutein and zeaxanthin. An application of the established method to various species of cereals and cereal byproducts is also shown. The highest carotenoid levels were found in maize (approximately 11.14 mg/kg of dry weight), which contains high amounts of beta-cryptoxanthin (2.40 mg/kg of dry weight), and, among the cereals considered, has the highest content of zeaxanthin (6.43 mg/kg of dry weight) and alpha+beta-carotene (1.44 mg/kg of dry weight). With the exception of maize, lutein is the main compound found (from 0.23 to 2.65 mg/kg of dry weight in oat and durum wheat, respectively).

The unheated oat globulin exists as a mixture of hexamer (>95%), trimer, and dimer forms of hexamer. The molecular weight of the hexamer was estimated by MALLS to be 330 000, close to that deduced from the genomic cloned data of the acidic and basic polypeptides of oat globulin. From QELS measurements, it can be predicted that the hexamer exists as two annular trimeric rings, with a diameter of 11.8 nm, placed on top of each other, forming an oblate cylinder with a height of about 8.5 nm. Upon heating at 100 degrees C, the oat globulin hexamers and trimers were dissociated into monomers. The heat-denatured monomers, probably assuming an extended structure, were associated to form small aggregates, which were further aggregated to high molecular weight complexes. Upon further heating (60 min), the soluble aggregates were associated to form insoluble aggregates. Aggregation of oat globulin occurred at a much faster rate at 110 degrees C.

The underlying mechanism for this reduction is, however, not fully understood. Two enzymes are thought to be primarily responsible for the turnover of O-acetyl ester groups on sialic acids; sialate-O-acetyltransferase (OAT) and sialate-O-acetylesterase (OAE). We have previously reported the characterization of OAT activity from normal colon mucosa, which efficiently O-acetylates CMP-Neu5Ac exclusively in the Golgi apparatus prior to the action of sialyltransferase. In this report we describe the identification of a lysosomal and a cytosolic OAE activity in human colonic mucosa that specifically hydrolyses 9-O-acetyl groups on sialic acid. Utilizing matched resection margin and cancer tissue from colorectal carcinoma patients we provide strong evidence suggesting that the level of O-acetylated sialic acids present in normal and diseased human colon may be dependent on the relative activities of OAT to lysosomal OAE.

12797742,"An affinity-based purification procedure with the immobilized family 11 Bacillus subtilis endoxylanase XynA allowed us to obtain high yields of highly pure endoxylanase inhibitor fractions from rye, barley, and durum wheat. In contrast, no inhibitors interacting with the B. subtilis endoxylanase affinity column are present in corn, buckwheat, rice, and oats. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and inhibitor specificity showed that the isolated inhibitors belonged to the TAXI endoxylanase inhibitor family, thus providing a view on the diversity of this cereal inhibitor family. The isolated inhibitors are basic proteins of ca. 40 kDa, occurring in two molecular forms, with pI values of ca. 8.5 (durum wheat) and ca. 9.0 (rye, barley). They are, in general, strong inhibitors of family 11 endoxylanases but not of family 10 endoxylanases. Because cereal endogenous endoxylanases belong to the latter family, this probably indicates that they do not influence cereal metabolic processes.

Highly purified oat CBP showed very weak but distinct immunochemical cross-reactivity with anti-wheat CBP IgG, indicating different immunogenic properties of the two CBPs. Nevertheless, both CBPs exhibited very similar binding of different cytokinins and were characterized by high affinity for N6-benzyladenine (BA)-type and by low affinity for zeatin-type cytokinins to both wheat and oat CBPs and by somewhat higher binding activities of oat CBP compared to wheat CBP (Kds for BA: 4.6 x 10-7 M and 6.8 x 10-7 M, respectively).

HPLC-mass spectrometry was used for identification. In addition, steryl ferulates of some selected milling byproducts were determined. The total steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains were 6.0 and 6.3 mg/100 g, respectively. Uneven distribution of steryl ferulates in the grains led to considerable differences in the milling products; their steryl ferulate contents ranged from trace amounts in flours with low ash content to 20 and 34 mg/100 g in rye and wheat brans, respectively. Campestanyl ferulate and sitostanyl ferulate were the main components, followed by campesteryl ferulate and sitosteryl ferulate, whereas sitosterol was the main component in total sterols. Among the other samples, a byproduct of rice milling (pearling dust) was the best source of steryl ferulates, its total steryl ferulate content being 119 mg/100 g, whereas no measurable amounts of steryl ferulates were measured in oat bran or pearling dust of barley.

To characterize this adduct, it was chromatographically compared with DNA adduct profiles generated in several in vitro and in vivo experimental systems. First, MCF-7 cells were exposed to a number of chemical carcinogens, that is, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 4-OH-B[a]P, 9-OH-B[a]P, 11-OH-B[a]P, B[a]P-trans-4,5-dihydrodiol, 1-nitropyrene, 6-nitrochrysene, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, benzo[c]phenanthrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, 3-methylcholanthrene, and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine. Spot 1 was detected as a minor adduct in cells treated with B[a]P but not other compounds. Second, to determine whether Spot 1 is derived from lipid peroxidation products or estrogen metabolites, it was compared with adduct profiles of cells or DNAs exposed to 17beta-estradiol, 4-hydroxy estradiol, 4-hydroxynonenal, or oxidized oat oil. Spot 1 was not detectable in these samples. In addition, Spot 1 did not comigrate with the 1,N(2)-ethenodeoxyguanosine adduct standard. Third, to explore the mechanism of Spot 1 formation, it was compared with adduct profiles detected in DNA or mononucleotides reacted with BPDE, 1-OH-7,8-dihydrodiol of B[a]P, and 3-OH-7,8-dihydrodiol of B[a]P as well as in rats orally treated with B[a]P. Spot 1 comigrated with a minor adduct in BPDE-treated DNA during anion exchange rechromatography but these two adducts were separated by partition chromatography. Spot 1 also behaved in a manner that was very similar to that of the polar B[a]P adducts detected in rat liver, but the two adducts were separated by HPLC. Fourth, Spot 1 was compared with CD1 mice exposed to 7H-benzo[c]fluorene (B[c]F). Spot 1 from some patients comigrated with a major adduct induced by B[c]F. Finally, we found that the presence of Spot 1 in human breast tissues was not related to smoking status but, rather, with CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism. The CYP1A1 mutant carriers had a significantly higher frequency of this adduct than did the wild-type genotypes. Furthermore, individuals with Spot 1 had a significantly higher staining intensity for BPDE-PAH adducts in their tissue sections than those without it.

Mean taste panel scores from a trained taste panel were calculated according to attributes (cereal, burnt, toasted, floury, and yeasty). Attributes were generally similar for both KDHO and flaked oats except in the yeasty attributes. Panelists were able to differentiate between groats, KDHO, and flaked oats (raw oats were not included). The largest effects of heat processing were found for the attributes toasted and yeasty aroma; toasted, cereal, and yeasty flavor; and toasted and yeasty aftertaste.

11312851,"A stable-isotope liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) assay was developed for the quantitative determination of folic acid in fortified foods. Folic acid was extracted from food samples into a phosphate buffer, purified on a C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge, and analyzed by LC-MS in the negative ion mode using electrospray ionization. The analyte was quantified using (13)C(5)-folic acid as an internal standard. The coefficient of variation for the precision of the method was 5.6% based on the analysis of four sample replicates. The accuracy of the method was assessed using a standard method of addition of folic acid to a shredded whole-wheat cereal. The quantitative determination of folic acid in this matrix was linear over 1 order of magnitude having a concentration range of 2.4 to 24 microg/g of food (or 0.05 to 0.5 microg of analyte injected into the LC-MS). The overall quantitative efficiency of the method was evaluated using a standard reference material (infant formula SRM 1846). The method was applied to the determination of folic acid in several test samples (fortified breakfast cereals), and the values were in accord with the manufacturer's claim. This method advances a LC-MS technique for the determination of folic acid in fortified foods based on stable-isotope dilution methodology. The specificity of the technique and quantitative accuracy of the method in various food substrates suggests that the method may be adapted for routine analysis in other fortified foods.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D018554', 'D002247', 'D002853', 'D002523', 'D005492', 'D005511', 'D005527', 'D021241', 'D003313']","['Avena', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Folic Acid', 'Food Handling', 'Food, Fortified', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Zea mays']",A quantitative stable-isotope LC-MS method for the determination of folic acid in fortified foods.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11312851,2001
11261993,The inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) content of commercially available dried infant cereals was measured by ion pair high-pressure liquid chromatography (ion pair HPLC) and ion exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography (ion exchange HPLC). Large differences between methods were apparent: ion pair HPLC gave values 14 to 190-fold lower than the values from ion exchange HPLC. Poor recoveries of added IP6 (25 to 60%) by ion pair HPLC suggested that some component of the infant cereal was responsible for the difference. Further experimentation suggested that an excess of minerals (approximately 11 mg/g calcium and 0.3 mg/g iron) in these samples sequestered the endogenously low phytate content. This problem may be unique to samples with low IP6 and high mineral content as wheat bran was not problematic.

11260160,"Patients with wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis experience severe allergic reactions when exercising after ingestion of wheat. The major wheat allergen associated with these reactions is a omega-5 gliadin, and patients following a gluten-free diet have remained free of symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine whether allergens cross-reacting with wheat omega-5 gliadin are present in rye, barley and oats. Sera from 23 adult patients with wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis were examined. Cereal allergens cross-reacting with wheat omega-5 gliadin were identified by immunoblot inhibition. The cross-reactive allergens were purified by gel filtration and reversed-phase chromatography and submitted to amino acid sequencing. Cross-reactivity was further studied by IgE ELISA and ELISA inhibition, and in vivo reactivity by skin prick testing. In immunoblotting rabbit anti-omega-5 gliadin antibodies bound to 70 kDa and 32 kDa proteins in rye and a 34-kDa protein in barley, but not to proteins in oats. N-terminal sequencing identified these proteins as rye gamma-70 secalin, rye gamma- 35 secalin and barley gamma-3 hordein, correspondingly. In ELISA 21/23 (91%) patients with wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis showed IgE antibodies to purified gamma-70 secalin, 19/23 (83%) to gamma-35 secalin and 21/23 (91%) to gamma-3 hordein. In ELISA inhibition omega-5 gliadin inhibited over 90% of the IgE binding of pooled patient sera to solid-phase gamma-secalins and gamma-3 hordein. Skin prick testing gave positive reactions to gamma-70 secalin in 10/15 (67%) patients, to gamma-35 secalin in 3/15 (20%) patients and to gamma-3 hordein in 7/15 (47%) patients. The results of this study show that gamma-70 and gamma-35 secalins in rye and gamma-3 hordein in barley cross-react with omega-5 gliadin, a major allergen in wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis.

Determinations were performed by Zeeman graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry, after dry ashing, with parallel determinations of certified reference samples. Mean cadmium levels were found to range from 1.10 to 23.5 micrograms/kg fresh weight concentrated formulas. Levels were related to the composition of the diets. Formulas based on cow's milk had the lowest concentrations. Soy formulas contained approximately six times more cadmium than cow's milk formulas, and diets with a cereal content had 4-21 times higher mean levels. The mean weekly intakes of dietary cadmium were estimated to vary between 0.10 and 3.05 micrograms/kg body weight of the child, if the recommended amount of formula were to be consumed at the recommended age, and if the child were of average weight. This estimation however does not include the contribution of cadmium from drinking water. The highest intake on a body weight basis was found in 6-month-old children, consuming the recommended amount of wheat-, oat- and milk-based formulas. This intake is below the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 7 micrograms/kg body weight, established by a WHO/FAO expert group. However, the risk assessment is based on renal effects in adults.

10702589,This experiment evaluated three hypotheses: i) production of propionate is increased during fermentation of substrate containing oat bran (OB)(6); ii) production of butyrate is increased during fermentation of substrate containing wheat bran (WB) and iii) results of in vitro fermentations using physiological substrates and inocula agree with in vivo data. Ileal digesta collected from swine fed OB and WB were the substrates. Digesta was fermented for 0-96 h in an anaerobic in vitro system using inocula prepared from ceca of rats fed the same fiber sources. Carbohydrate and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) contents in the fermentations were measured by gas chromatography. Fermentation of WB digesta did not produce more n-butyrate (P > 0.05) and was significantly slower (P < 0.05) than fermentation of OB digesta. OB digesta fermentation produced a significantly greater (P < 0.05) molar proportion of SCFA as propionate.

Zearalanone (ZAN), which does not occur in nature, was used as internal standard for quantification. A linear working range from 1.0 microg/kg to 1000 microg/kg could be achieved in grains with a standard deviation of 4% and recovery rates around 100%.

Chlormequat (2-chloro-N,N,N-trimethylethylammonium, CAS RN 7003-89-6) and mepiquat (1,1-dimethylpiperidinium, CAS RN 15302-91-7) are plant growth regulators used to stabilize stalks in cereals. The study was part of the Danish National Pesticide Survey, managed by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration. Samples were collected in autumn 1997. Residue contents were determined with a newly developed liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method for chlormequat analysis. The method was extended to include mepiquat in the present study. Quantitation was done by the internal standards method, using mass chromatograms of the most intense daughter ions of mepiquat (m/z 98), chlormequat (m/z 58), and [13C]-chlormequat (m/z 61, internal standard). For chlormequat, the overall limit of detection (LD) was 6 micrograms/kg and the limit of determination (LOD) was 10 micrograms/kg. For mepiquat, LD was 2 micrograms/kg and LOD was 3 micrograms/kg. Of 77 samples analyzed, 51 contained chlormequat and 11 contained mepiquat. The highest levels of chlormequat were found in samples of oatmeal (3.76 mg/kg) and rye (1.08 mg/kg).

The main results were that all three LAB utilized oat beta-gluco-oligosaccharides, while only L. plantarum utilized xylo-oligosaccharides. The main products of LAB metabolism were lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid and ethanol. The results indicated that oat beta-gluco-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides induce LAB to form the end-products of a typical mixed-acid fermentation. The formation of mixed-acid production from xylo-oligosaccharides was mainly due to the starvation of cells.

Besides, gliadins, hordeins and secalins are recognised to the same extent. The system provides a high detection sensitivity for gliadins, hordeins, secalins and avenins (1.5, 0.05, 0.15 and 12 ng/ml, respectively).

High-performance anion-exchange chromatography and gel-permeation analysis of the hydrolysis products indicated the preferential hydrolysis of highly branched structures by the enzyme; wheat arabinoxylan and rye (Secale cereale) arabinoxylan (high arabinose to xylose ratios) were hydrolyzed more efficiently by this enzyme than oat (Avena sativa) spelt xylan (low arabinose to xylose ratios). The release of the hydrolysis products as a function of time suggested that the endoxylanolytic activity was associated with the release of arabinose units from the polysaccharides, suggesting that the enzyme action is similar to that by endoxylanases from Ceratocystis paradoxa, Aspergillus niger, and Neurospora crassa. Although the enzyme released arabinose from arabinoxylan, it did not hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside.

Fumonisins were not detected in samples of barley, wheat, soya, oats, rice, corn syrup or oil, corn-on-the-cob, corn-fed chicken or wheat flour tortilla. Despite detectable fumonisin contamination in samples of the original maize, fumonisins were not detected in samples of the food products obtained from commercial maize processing. Low levels were detected in samples of tacos and in some foods containing corn-based thickeners, such as instant semolina pudding and instant custard powder. Approximately 78% of corn snack samples contained fumonisins (11-220 micrograms/kg), while 24% of breakfast cereals contained total fumonisins at between 11 and 194 micrograms/kg. Although none of the ready-made popcorn samples contained detectable levels of fumonisins, 46% of popping corn samples and microwaveable popcorn contained fumonisins at 14-784 micrograms/kg. The highest levels of fumonisins were detected in samples of polenta with concentrations ranging from 16 to 2124 micrograms/kg.

In a total of 410 wheat samples and 140 rye samples of two harvesting years (1993, 1994) and in random samples of barley and oats no fumonisins were detected at all. In german grain-maize of 1993, only low fumonisin contents (17-33 ng/g) were detected occasionally. Some grainmaize samples of the 1994 harvest contained significantly higher fumonisin amounts, partly up to the mg/kg-range, which obviously is due to the extremely high temperatures during summer. In some samples of variety tests of the country the fumonisin B1 content amounted up to 4828 ng/g and the total fumonisin content (FB1-FB3) up to 7132 ng/g respectively.

Six adult males were given two diet sequences in random order: a low-fiber diet (standard Western diet for 14 d) followed by a labeled low-fiber test meal or a fiber-supplemented diet (40 g oat bran/d for 14 d) followed by a labeled oat bran (40 g) test meal. The test meals provided 192.5 mg cholesterol, including 80.1 mg octadeuterated cholesterol. Fasting and hourly postmeal blood samples were obtained for 7 h. Isotopic cholesterol ratios [tracer:(tracer+native cholesterol)] were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Chylomicron triacylglycerol and cholesterol concentrations peaked after 2-3 h and returned to baseline after 7 h. After the low-fiber test meal, the isotopic cholesterol ratio continuously increased until 7 h in the chylomicron fraction (4.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(-3)) and whole plasma (1.04 +/- 0.39 x 10(-3)). At 7 h postprandial, the maximum dietary cholesterol concentration in the chylomicron fraction and plasma cholesterol was 1 in 99 and 1 in 397 cholesterol molecules, respectively. No marked differences were obtained after the high-fiber sequence compared with the low-fiber one; there was a comparable isotopic cholesterol ratio and concentration in the chylomicron fraction and a slightly lower (-44%, P < 0.10) 0-7 h area under the curve whole-plasma deuterated cholesterol concentration.

The H+-ATPase consists of at least eight subunits, of 95, 66, 56, 54, 40, 38, 31, and 16 kD, that did not cross-react with polyclonal antibodies raised to the plasmalemma ATPase of Arabidopsis thaliana. The 66-kD polypeptide cross-reacted with monoclonal antibodies raised to the 70-kD subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase of oat roots. The functional molecular size of the tonoplast H+-ATPase, analyzed in situ by radiation inactivation, was found to be around 400 kD. The 66-kD subunit of the tonoplast H+-ATPase was rapidly phosphorylated by [[gamma]-32P]ATP in vitro. The complete loss of radio-activity in the 66-kD subunit after a short pulse-chase experiment with unlabeled ATP reflected a rapid turnover, which characterizes a phosphorylated intermediate. Phosphoenzyme formed from ATP is an acylphosphate-type compound as shown by its sensitivity to hydroxylamine and alkaline pH.

Preliminary results from the area have suggested low selenium intakes and the possible occurrence of cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease) in the population. A low selenium concentration in foods grown locally was found: mean selenium concentration in wheat grains was 1, 5, and 28 micrograms/kg, respectively, in three villages studied, that of oats was between 3-6 micrograms/kg, and of cow's milk 10-27 micrograms/kg dry matter. The selenium concentration of bread was considerably higher, between 87-337 micrograms/kg dry wt, presumably because wheat imported from the US had been used for baking. Occasional samples of pork, beef, and mutton contained between 32-218 micrograms selenium/kg dry wt. Low selenium concentrations were observed in samples of soil and river water. The mean plasma selenium concentration of 52 persons was 1.02 mumol/L, including 33 children and 19 adult subjects. The selenium concentrations in red blood cells and toenails were 1.95 mumol/L and 0.61 mg/kg, respectively. No symptoms of heart disease caused by selenium deficiency were observed. It is concluded that the selenium status of people was fairly good thanks to the contribution to dietary intake of imported wheat with a high selenium content.

Volatile metabolites produced by the cultures were collected on a porous polymer adsorbent by passing an airstream through the vessel. Volatile metabolites were collected between days 2 and 5 after inoculation. CO2 production was simultaneously measured, and after the cultivation period ergosterol contents and the numbers of CFU of the cultures were determined. Alcohols of low molecular weight and sesquiterpenes were the dominant compounds found. During growth on oat grain the production of 8-carbon alcohols and 3-methyl-1-butanol was higher and the production of terpenes was lower than during growth on agar substrates. The compositions of the volatile metabolites from oat grain were more similar to those from wheat grain, which was used as a substrate in a previous investigation, than to those produced on any of the agar substrates. Regarding the agar substrates, the production of terpenes was most pronounced on the artificial substrates (Czapek agar and Norkrans agar) whereas alcohol production was highest on substrates based on cereals. The production of volatile metabolites was highly correlated with the production of CO2 and moderately correlated with ergosterol contents, whereas no correlation with the numbers of CFU was found.

The study included 190 field samples of wheat, barley, rye and oat with visibly damaged ears, 45 samples of wheat intended for feed production and two series of wheat flour (type 550) and whole wheat flour collected in October 1987 and June 1988. The field samples examined showed a high DON contamination of wheat (87%) with an average of 3.96 mg/kg and a maximum of 43.8 mg/kg. Mean levels between 0.33 mg/kg and 0.27 mg/kg DON could be detected in barley, rye and oat. Of the wheat samples, 58% contained ZEA with a maximum of 1.560 mg/kg. The highest levels of ZEA were detected in samples which also showed high concentrations of DON. The NIV and T-2 toxin levels were comparatively low. Thirty percent of the samples showed NIV concentrations between 0.04 mg/kg and 0.29 mg/kg and 38% contained between 0.005 and 0.60 mg/kg of T-2.

EDB residues were extracted by soaking in hexane, triple co-distillation with hexane from an aqueous sample solution, and soaking in acetone-water (5 + 1). Each method was used for triplicate analyses of 12 samples containing incurred residues of EDB ranging from about 10 to 1000 ppb and representing whole grains (wheat and oats) and intermediate grain-based products such as corn meal and flour. The 4-day hexane soaking method extracted the least EDB. In some cases, this was half of the amount determined by the other methods. Levels from soaking in acetone-water were equal to, or up to 25% greater than, those from distillation. Although soaking for 2 days is required for whole grains in the method, a period of only 16 h was found acceptable for ground products. Results were obtained faster with the distillation method, but more analyst time per sample was required. A single distillation recovered about 80% (40-60% from wheat) of total EDB extracted by triple distillation.

The purpose of this study was to determine the allelopathic potential of wild oat (Avena fatua) on the growth of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Fieldwin) in the absence of plant competition. Wild oat and spring wheat plants were grown separately in 250-ml beakers in a sand medium. Root exudates were extracted from wild oat medium at the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-leaf stages of wild oat development and added to beakers containing spring wheat in temporally corresponding stages of development. Spring wheat root and leaf dry weights were measured to determine if one or more allelochemical agents were released from wild oat roots. Spring wheat leaf and root dry weights were significantly reduced by exudates from wild oat plants at the 2- and 4-leaf stages of development, respectively. Allelochemicals were isolated from wild oat root exudates at various stages of plant development. Paper chromatography analysis indicated that at least two unknown compounds were present.R f values in benzene-acetic acid-water of the two unknown compounds (0.825 and 0.930) were similar to scopoletin (7-hydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin) and vanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid), respectively. Additional tests using diazotizedp-nitraniline, ultraviolet absorption spectra, and gas chromatography analysis also indicated that the unknowns were coumarin-related compounds such as scopoletin and vanillic acid.

Similar high titres were found when these coeliac sera were tested against rye, barley and oat prolamines. Maize prolamines gave only low titres and no antibodies could be detected against rice proteins, in line with the tolerance of these latter two cereals by patients with coeliac disease. It would appear that sera from coeliac patients react with more than one antigenic fraction of protein in wheat and other cereals.

4582816,"Bioproduction of viriditoxin on various substrates by strains of the Aspergillus fumigatus group was determined under several incubation conditions. Aspergillus viridi-nutans strains NRRL 4365 and 576 produced the largest quantities of toxin, A. brevipes gave reduced yields, and there was no detectable synthesis by isolates of four related species. After 30 days in static culture at 20 C on various autoclaved agricultural commodities, optimal yields of 440 and 380 mg of toxin were observed per kilogram of sorghum and rice. Toxin levels were reduced on corn, rye, and wheat (40-200 mg/kg); yields were low on cottonseed, barley, and oats. Incubation at 10 C restricted biosynthesis of viriditoxin, and no toxin accumulated on substrates maintained at 5 C for 120 days. In a liquid, yeast extract-sucrose medium, maximal mycotoxin production developed in shake flasks; after 156 h, 10 mg of toxin accumulated per gram of mycelium. Viriditoxin produced in submerged culture was associated with the mycelium; less than 1% was detected in the filtered broth after 156 h of incubation.",Applied microbiology,"['D001230', 'D001232', 'D055598', 'D002621', 'D003374', 'D002523', 'D005285', 'D005516', 'D009183', 'D013045', 'D013050', 'D013056']","['Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus fumigatus', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Coumarins', 'Edible Grain', 'Fermentation', 'Food Microbiology', 'Mycotoxins', 'Species Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",Viriditoxin production by Aspergillus viridi-nutans and related species.,"['Q000254', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None]","['growth & development', 'metabolism', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4582816,1973
5061921,Dopa has been identified in rat food by three different fluorimetric assays and paper chromatography. Incubation of the rat food with proteolytic enzymes dramatically increased the measurable free dopa. Analysis of samples of six individual protein-containing constituents of rat food revealed that both wheat and oats contain dopa.,"Science (New York, N.Y.)","['D000821', 'D000818', 'D000830', 'D002854', 'D002523', 'D000455', 'D008892', 'D011402', 'D051381', 'D013025', 'D014908', 'D014443', 'D003313']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Animals, Laboratory', 'Chromatography, Paper', 'Edible Grain', 'Medicago sativa', 'Milk', 'Pronase', 'Rats', 'Soybeans', 'Triticum', 'Tyrosine', 'Zea mays']",Dihydroxyphenylalanine in rat food containing wheat and oats.,"['Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'pharmacology', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5061921,1972
6031432,"A method has been developed for the production of aflatoxin by growing Aspergillus flavus NRRL 3145 on solid substrate wheat. Optimal yields of 900 mug of aflatoxin G(1) and 900 mug of aflatoxin B(1) per g of substrate were obtained in 4 to 5 days at 28 C. A study of aflatoxin production on hulls and groats of oats and on whole oats by A. flavus strains NRRL 2999, NRRL 3000, and NRRL 3145 revealed that aflatoxin was produced on all three substrates, although production was very slight on hulls. Strain NRRL 3145 grown on solid substrate groats produced the largest amounts of aflatoxin: 580 mug of B(1) and 450 mug of G(1) per g of substrate. A densitometric method for reading thin-layer chromatographic plates is described; this is more objective and more accurate than the visual methods previously used for the determination of all four aflatoxins.",Applied microbiology,"['D000348', 'D001230', 'D002855', 'D003720', 'D002523', 'D005285', 'D014908']","['Aflatoxins', 'Aspergillus', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Densitometry', 'Edible Grain', 'Fermentation', 'Triticum']",Production of aflatoxin on wheat and oats: measurement with a recording densitometer.,"['Q000032', 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None]","['analysis', 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6031432,1967
