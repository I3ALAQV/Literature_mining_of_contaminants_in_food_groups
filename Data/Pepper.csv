35347716,"Fermentation of eight vegetables was studied as an alternative for reclamation of surplus volumes. Fermentation performance was predicted by comparing the amounts of acid that could be produced from the intrinsic sugar content with that buffered by the fresh vegetable matrices prior to reaching an inhibitory pH for fermentative microbes (3.30). Native fermentations were brined with 345.0 mM sodium chloride, 40.0 mM calcium chloride, 6.0 mM potassium sorbate, and vinegar to adjust the initial pH to 4.70. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis, pH, and carbon dioxide measurements and spiral plating on selective media were employed to monitor the progress of fermentations. The average colony counts for yeast and/or molds and Enterobacteriaceae declined to undetectable levels from 3.6 ± 1.5 log CFU/ml within 7 days of fermentation. The fermentation of sugars produced lactic, acetic, succinic, and/or malic acids, and ethanol. As predicted, the fermentation of vegetables with low sugar content, such as broccoli, green leaf lettuce, and green pea proceeded to completion. The fermentation of vegetables with a moderate sugar content, such as green bell pepper, red ripened tomato, and green bean were incomplete at pH 3.1 ± 0.2. The fermentation of high sugar vegetables including sweet potato and corn were expected and observed to be incomplete. It is concluded that the intrinsic sugar content and buffer capacity of surplus vegetables are relevant parameters in obtaining complete fermentations. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Vegetables are the second most wasted commodity in the United States and a substantial constituent of the global food waste. Development of fermentation to reclaim surplus vegetables from farms, grocery stores, and farmer's markets offers opportunities to ameliorate economic losses and environmental impact and add value to waste. The research described here suggests that a fraction of vegetables could be fermented in cover brines while others, with high sugar content, need specialized handling. Evidently, optimization of vegetable fermentation with starter cultures and added buffers represent an opportunity to stimulate complete bioconversions useful for reclaiming surplus volumes.",Journal of food science,[],[],Vegetable fermentations brined with low salt for reclaiming food waste.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35347716,2022
35195174,"Food loss due to contamination caused by fungi has much impact on agriculture and leads to significant economic losses. Synthetic and natural fungicides have been used for avoiding losses of several food products due to fungal contamination. As a result, species of the genus Capsicum have been used for preserving food because of their chemical compounds with antifungal activity. Therefore, this study aimed at identifying some phenolic compounds found in both ethyl acetate extract (EAE) and methanolic extract (ME) from habanero pepper (C. chinense) ripe fruit by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (LC-ESI-MS/MS) and at evaluating their antifungal activities against fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Rhizopus stolonifer and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Extracts resulted from a sequential process of maceration. Antifungal activity was evaluated by the disk diffusion method (DDM) at the following doses of both diluted extracts: 25 µL, 50 µL, 100 µL and 200 µL. The chemical analysis showed that there were protocatechuic acid, gentisic acid, vanillic acid, kaempferol-3-O-robinobiosideo and naringenin in both extracts. EAE showed high inhibition of mycelial growth at both doses 100µL and 200µL against the three fungi while methanolic exhibited weak activity even at the highest dose under investigation.

34812593,"Cera pepper (Capsicum pubescens) is an exotic fruit considered as a rich source of nutraceuticals with known benefits for human health and also an economic resource for local producers in Mexico. The present investigation reports on the in vitro and in situ antifungal activity of the essential oil from Mentha piperita and its two major volatiles (menthol and menthone) against Fusarium sambucinum, which is a causal agent of soft rot in cera pepper. The application of these components in pepper fruits previously infected with F. sambucinum caused a significant delay (p<0.05) in the emergence of soft rot symptoms. This effect was reflected in the maintenance of pH and fruit firmness during a period of 10 days. The nutrimental content of the fruits (protein, fiber, fat and other proximate parameters) was conserved in the same period of time. The nutraceutical content of these fruits was estimated by the quantification of seven carotenoids (violaxanthin, cis-violaxanthin, luteoxanthin, antheraxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin and β-carotene), ascorbic acid and capsaicinoids (capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin). According to our results, the essential oil from M. Piperita and its major volatiles exerted a preservative effect on these metabolites.

In the present study, the volatile profiles of 96 samples of two different ground bell peppers harvested in diverse Italian geographical areas, Altino (Abruzzo) and Senise (Lucania), and a commercial sweet paprika, have been studied by means of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The investigation of their volatile profile has led to the identification of 59 analytes. Eventually, a discriminant classifier, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), was exploited to discriminate samples according to their geographical origin. The model provided very accurate results in external validation; in fact, it correctly classified all the 30 test samples, achieving 100% correct classification (on the validation set). Furthermore, in order to understand which volatiles contribute the most at differentiating the bell peppers from the different origins, a variable selection approach, Variable Importance in Projection (VIP), was used.

33599813,"Pungent traits caused by capsaicinoids are characteristic of chili peppers (Capsicum spp.), and the pungent-variable sweet chili pepper 'Shishito' (Capsicum annuum) is unique in being known for the pungency in fruits with few seeds. In the present study, we tried to clarify the relationship between the number of seeds and pungency in 'Shishito'. First, we investigated the pungency of 'Shishito' by simple sensory evaluations and quantifications of capsaicinoids by high-performance liquid chromatography. As a result, few-seeded fruits had a larger fluctuation of capsaicinoid content than many-seeded ones. This indicates that the number of seeds, in particular a decrease of the seeds, has some sort of connection with the pungency of 'Shishito'. Then, we analyzed the relationship between pungency and gene expression involving capsaicinoid biosynthesis at the individual fruit level. We vertically separated the placental septum in which capsaicinoids are synthesized and performed quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for 18 genes involved in capsaicinoid biosynthesis. We also used the placental septum for capsaicinoid quantification so that the gene expression levels and capsaicinoid contents in the same fruits were obtained, and their correlations were analyzed using 20 biological replicates. Among the 18 genes, expression levels of 11 genes (WRKY9, CaMYB31, AT3, BCAT, BCKDH, KAS I, KAS III, ACL, CaKR1, FAT, and pAMT) had a significant positive correlation with the capsaicinoid concentration, and they were considered to upregulate capsaicinoid biosynthesis.

33454869,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are molecules present in several life forms, possess broad-spectrum of inhibitory activity against pathogenic microorganisms, and are a promising alternative to combat the multidrug resistant pathogens. The aim of this work was to identify and characterize AMPs from Capsicum chinense fruits and to evaluate their inhibitory activities against yeasts of the genus Candida and α-amylases. Initially, after protein extraction from fruits, the extract was submitted to anion exchange chromatography resulting two fractions. Fraction D1 was further fractionated by molecular exclusion chromatography, and three fractions were obtained. These fractions showed low molecular mass peptides, and in fraction F3, only two protein bands of approximately 6.5 kDa were observed. Through mass spectrometry, we identified that the lowest molecular mass protein band of fraction F3 showed similarity with AMPs from plant defensin family. We named this peptide CcDef3 (Capsicum chinense defensin 3). The antifungal activity of these fractions was analyzed against yeasts of the genus Candida. At 200 μg/mL, fraction F1 inhibited the growth of C. tropicalis by 26%, fraction F2 inhibited 35% of the growth of C. buinensis, and fraction F3 inhibited all tested yeasts, exhibiting greater inhibition activity on the growth of the yeast C. albicans (86%) followed by C. buinensis (69%) and C. tropicalis (21%). Fractions F1 and F2 promoted membrane permeabilization of all tested yeasts and increased the endogenous induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in C. buinensis and C. tropicalis, respectively. We also observed that fraction F3 at a concentration of 50 µg/mL inhibited the α-amylase activities of Tenebrio molitor larvae by 96% and human salivary by 100%.

The red bell peppers were evaluated based on quality attributes such as: total carotenoids content; polyphenols; vitamin C; antioxidant activity and sugars content. Vitamin C and sugar content were analyzed using liquid chromatography and other measurements were determined based on the spectrophotometric method. Results showed that the blanching in water or in steam reduced bioactive compounds concentration; whereas non-thermal treatments as pulsed electric field (PEF) applied separately or in combination with ultrasound (US + PEF) let to obtain similar or slightly lower content of bioactive compounds in comparison to untreated peppers.

The present study aimed to purify and characterize peptides from Capsicum chinense fruits and evaluate their inhibitory activities against different phytopathogenic fungi and also analyze the possible mechanisms of action involved in microbial inhibition. After fruit protein extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), different fractions were obtained, named F1 to F10. Peptides in the F4 and F5 fractions were sequenced and revealed similarity with the plant antimicrobial peptides like non-specific lipid transfer proteins and defensin-like peptide.

In addition, we identified two sequences of AMPs in the F2 and F3 fractions through mass spectrometry that showed similarity to an already well-characterized family of plant defensins. A plasma membrane permeabilization assay demonstrated that the peptides present in F2, F3, and F4 fractions induced changes in the membrane of some yeast strains, culminating in permeabilization. The production of reactive oxygen species was induced by the fractions in some yeast strains. Fractions F2, F3, and F4 also did not show toxicity in macrophage or monocyte cultures.

In addition, the fruit cutin lipid composition plays an important role in post-harvest water loss rates, which in turn causes shriveling and reduced fruit quality and storage. In this study, we integrated metabolome and transcriptome profiling pertaining to cutin in two habanero genotypes: PI 224448 and PI 257145. The fruits were selected by the waxy or glossy phenotype on their surfaces. Metabolomics analysis showed a significant variation in cutin composition, with about 6-fold higher cutin in PI 257145 than PI 224448. It also revealed that 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecanoic acid is the most abundant monomer in PI 257145. Transcriptomic analysis of high-cutin PI 257145 and low-cutin PI 224448 resulted in the identification of 2703 statistically significant differentially expressed genes, including 1693 genes upregulated and 1010 downregulated in high-cutin PI 257145. Genes and transcription factors such as GDSL lipase, glycerol-3 phosphate acyltransferase 6, long-chain acyltransferase 2, cytochrome P450 86A/77A, SHN1, ANL2 and HDG1 highly contributed to the high cutin content in PI 257145.

This is the first study of the transcriptome and metabolome pertaining to cutin in habanero peppers.

With this TD-ESI/MS/MS approach, 308 pesticides were monitored, where a mixture containing 15 pesticide standards was successfully identified to demonstrate the capability of this approach to screen trace multiresidue pesticides. The approach had reasonable detection limits (<50 ppb) and reproducibility (RSD: 8.43%, n = 9) from the analysis of a benthiazole standard solution. Real samples including a tomato and bell pepper were analyzed using this TD-ESI/MS/MS approach.

Biofilms form on surfaces after bacterial adhesion, and they function as bacterial reservoirs and as resistance and tolerance factors against antibiotics and the host immune response. Technological strategies to control biofilms and bacterial adhesion, such as the use of surface coatings, are being explored more frequently, and natural peptides may promote their development. In this study, we purified and identified antibiofilm peptides from Capsicum baccatum (red pepper) using chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, MALDI-MS, MS/MS and bioinformatics. These peptides strongly controlled biofilm formation by Staphylococcus epidermidis, the most prevalent pathogen in device-related infections, without any antibiotic activity. Furthermore, natural peptide-coated surfaces dislayed effective antiadhesive proprieties and showed no cytotoxic effects against different representative human cell lines. Finally, we determined the lead peptide predicted by Mascot and identified CSP37, which may be useful as a prime structure for the design of new antibiofilm agents.

These naturally occurring products induce beneficial consequences in plant metabolism and productivity. In most cases their modes of action, and consequences for the whole plant as well as parts, such as the fruit, are well characterized, but the precise mechanisms of action require further attention. This study examined the effects of the commercial biostimulant, Actium®, on Capsicum annuum L. cv Palermo leaves and fruits. The influence of time (characterized by ripening), after 14 and 28 days of treatment, treatment regimen, and their combined impact on the metabolome were studied using HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis of polar and apolar compounds. The results showed that flavonoids and capsianosides decreased with ripening in leaves, but organic acids, monosaccharides, and carotenoids increased in fruits. The treatment of Capsicum fruits with Actium® increased phenylalanine and total monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) compared to controls, suggesting a further stage in ripening. An increase in carotenoids concomitant with an increase of some digalactosyl diacylglycerols, which are part of the chromoplasts lipid machinery of enzymes involved in the synthesis of carotenoids, was also observed.

LOQ values of acetamiprid, chlorpyrifos and formetanate hydrochloride were estimated as 2, 10 and 5 µg/kg, respectively. Capia peppers grown in open fields were sprayed three times with pesticides. Peppers were harvested after 1st, 2nd and 3rd day of the treatments. Then the peppers were subjected to tap water, acetic acid and citric acid washing and ultrasonic cleaning treatments (for 2 and 5 min). Based on three different harvest times and two different washing durations, processing factors (PFs) and reduction rates were calculated for each washing treatment. The residues gradually decreased during washing treatments with increasing process duration. Similarly, a gradual reduction was noted with the progress of harvest times. This in turn corresponded to an increase in PF. Ultrasonic cleaning and citric acid (9%) washing were more effective than the others. Non-systemic pesticides (chlorpyrifos) were more readily removed than the systemic ones (acetamiprid).

Since this transition leads to the production of reactive species, chromoplasts are characteristic sites for biosynthesis and accumulation of carotenoids and other antioxidants. Here, we have analysed the chromoplast membranes from Capsicum annuum L. fruits, finding a significant expression of the capsanthin/capsorubin synthase. This enzyme was isolated by a very mild procedure allowing its analyses under quasi-native conditions. The isolated complex appeared as a red coloured homo-trimer, suggesting the retention of at least one of the typical carotenoids from C. annuum. Moreover, the protein complex was co-purified with a non-proteinaceous fraction of carotenoid aggregates carrying a high molecular weight and separable only by Size Exclusion Chromatography. This last finding suggested a relationship between the carotenoids synthesis on chromoplast membranes, the presence, and storage of organised carotenoids aggregates typical for chromoplasts. Further MS analyses also provided important hints on the interactome network associated to the capsanthin/capsorubin synthase, confirming its functional relevance during ripening.

Additionally, we used microstructural, organoleptic, and physicochemical investigations to monitor the primary physiological metabolism of bell peppers.

31027574,"Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is the most abundant capsaicinoids found in hot peppers (Capsicum annum and Capsicum frutescens). It has been well documented that capsaicin plays an important role in the defense against the attack of herbivores or pathogens on Capsicum plants. A few insect herbivores such as Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa assulta have been recorded to be capable of feeding on hot pepper fruits, suggesting that these insects evolve mechanisms against the toxicity of capsaicin. Although cytochrome P450-meidated detoxification is considered to be an important mechanism by which cotton bollworms cope with capsaicin, experimental evidence is lacking. In this study, we compared the capacity of four H. armigera P450s (CYP6B6, CYP9A12, CYP9A14 and CYP9A17) in capsaicin metabolism, and the capsaicin metabolites were screened and tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

We demonstrated that CaGGPPS1 interacts with a catalytically inactive small subunit homologue protein CaSSUII, and such an interaction promotes CaGGPPS1 enzymatic activity. We also revealed a protein-protein interaction between CaSSUII and a putative phytoene synthase and the repression of carotenoid accumulation by silencing CaSSUII in pepper fruits.

29754610,"Thread spray ambient ionization uses single threads as a medium for sampling and ionization. This approach was demonstrated through the detection of various capsaicinoids from the interior of pepper fruits without destruction of the sample. Pepper residues present on the thread were analyzed by the application of DC voltage and solvent to cause field-induced charged droplet generation. Capsaicinoids extracted from the sample are contained in the electrosprayed droplets and transported to the mass spectrometer for characterization. The thread spray mass spectrometry method was optimized using commercially available materials like 100% cotton, cotton:polyester (35/65), 100% polyester, and nylon fabrics and subsequently applied for in-situ analysis of six different pepper fruits and pepper spray residues on fabrics. The results indicated that the special physico-chemical characteristics of threads allowed a rapid and convenient sampling and ionization of pepper products for analysis by mass spectrometry.

However, studies about the bioaccessibility of polyphenols as a parameter to measure the nutritional quality and bioefficacy of them in the fruit after consumption are scarce. Chiltepin showed phenolic acids and flavonoids contents between 387 and 65 μg/g, respectively. Nevertheless, these values decreased after the digestion process. Before digestion, gallic acid, 4-hydroxibenzoinc acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, quercetin and luteolin were the main polyphenols found in chiltepin by HPLC-DAD and confirmed by FIA-ESI-IT-MS/MS. Gallic and chlorogenic acids were non-detected in the gastric phase, while only p-coumaric acid (5.35 ± 3.89 μg/g), quercetin (5.91 ± 0.92 μg/g) and luteolin (2.86 ± 0.62 μg/g) were found in the intestinal phase. The bioaccessibility of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and total polyphenols after the intestinal phase was around 24, 17 and 23%, respectively.

Important traits of Shimatogarashi peppers, such as color; proportion of organic acids, capsaicinoids, and aromatic compounds; and antioxidant activity in three stages of maturity (green (immature), orange (turning), and red (mature) stages) were characterized. The results indicated that the concentration of organic acids, including ascorbic, citric, and malic acid, increased during ripening. In addition, the amount of capsaicinoids, which are responsible for the pungent taste of chili peppers, increased as the fruit matured to the orange and red stages. The volatile compound profile of Shimatogarashi was dominated by the presence of esters, which mainly contributed to fruity notes. The total amount of volatile compounds analyzed by gas chromatography-headspace solid-phase microextraction (GC-HS-SPME), especially esters, decreased as the fruit changed in color from green to red. This was in contrast to the amount of terpenoids, especially limonene, which increased at the red stage, denoting a change in flavor from fruity to a more citrus-like aroma. Based on the total phenolic content (TPC), the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical method, the antioxidant capacity of Shimatogarashi showed an increase at the mature red stage.

In this study, we observed the hydrolyzing activity of a fungus-inducible pepper carboxylesterase (PepEST) on cell walls of C. gloeosporioides, causing growth retardation of the fungus by blocking appressorium formation. To determine the cellular basis for the growth inhibition, we observed the localization of PepEST on the fungus and found the attachment of the protein on surfaces of conidia and germination tubes. Moreover, we examined the decomposition of cell-wall materials from the fungal surface after reaction with PepEST, which led to the identification of 1,2-dithiane-4,5-diol (DTD) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Exogenous DTD treatment did not elicit expression of defense-related genes in the host plant but did trigger the necrosis of C. gloeosporioides. Furthermore, the DTD compound displayed protective effects on pepper fruits and plants against C. gloeosporioides and C. coccodes, respectively. In addition, DTD was also effective in preventing other diseases, such as rice blast, tomato late blight, and wheat leaf rust. Therefore, our results provide evidence that PepEST is involved in hydrolysis of the outmost layer of the fungal cell walls and that DTD has antifungal activity, suggesting an alternative strategy to control agronomically important phytopathogens.",Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,"['D002212', 'D043182', 'D002473', 'D020231']","['Capsicum', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Cell Wall', 'Colletotrichum']",A Fungus-Inducible Pepper Carboxylesterase Exhibits Antifungal Activity by Decomposing the Outer Layer of Fungal Cell Walls.,"['Q000201', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187']","['enzymology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29189097,2018

Thus, patients with Refsum's disease have to follow a specific diet resigning foods with high levels of phytanic acid and trans-phytol like products from ruminant animals with a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of ≤ 10 mg/d.

In this study we carried out in vitro-digestion experiments of PFAE with artificial digestion fluids. Our results demonstrate that PFAE actually are a source for bioavailable trans-phytol and thus add to the TDI. Eating only one portion of bell pepper (∼150 g) could therefore lead to exploitation of the TDI of up to 81%.

28678344,"The objective of this study was to investigate prebiotic potential, chemical composition, and antioxidant capacity of spice extracts. Seven culinary spices including black pepper, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, ginger, Mediterranean oregano, rosemary, and turmeric were extracted with boiling water. Major chemical constituents were characterized by RP-HPLC-DAD method and antioxidant capacity was determined by measuring colorimetrically the extent to scavenge ABTS radical cations. Effects of spice extracts on the viability of 88 anaerobic and facultative isolates from intestinal microbiota were determined by using Brucella agar plates containing serial dilutions of extracts. A total of 14 phenolic compounds, a piperine, cinnamic acid, and cinnamaldehyde were identified and quantitated. Spice extracts exhibited high antioxidant capacity that correlated with the total amount of major chemicals. All spice extracts, with the exception of turmeric, enhanced the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. All spices exhibited inhibitory activity against selected Ruminococcus species. Cinnamon, oregano, and rosemary were active against selected Fusobacterium strains and cinnamon, rosemary, and turmeric were active against selected Clostridium spp. Some spices displayed prebiotic-like activity by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppressing the growth of pathogenic bacteria, suggesting their potential role in the regulation of intestinal microbiota and the enhancement of gastrointestinal health. The identification and quantification of spice-specific phytochemicals provided insight into the potential influence of these chemicals on the gut microbial communities and activities.

This study was conducted to determine how cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected chilli plants affect the fitness and settling preferences of nonvector whitefly, Bemisia tabaci adults under dual-choice conditions with volatile organic compounds analyzed using solid phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results showed that the presence of CMV in chilli plants substantially affects the settling preferences of the B. tabaci, which preferred to settle on noninfected plants. Duration of the egg stage and the longevity and fecundity of adult B. tabaci on CMV-infected chilli plants were not markedly different from those on noninfected chilli plants. In contrast, the developmental time from egg to adult was significantly reduced in CMV-infected chilli plants compared to the noninfected plants. The results also showed that CMV-infected chilli plants released significantly more linalool and phenylacetaldehyde than noninfected plants. Overall, it was suggested that the behavioral response of B. tabaci might be modified by CMV-infected plants, which alter the release of specific headspace volatiles.

28208834,"Vitamin D deficiency is a global concern. Much research has concentrated on the endogenous synthesis of vitamin D in human skin following exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-315 nm). In many regions of the world there is insufficient UV-B radiation during winter months for adequate vitamin D production, and even when there is sufficient UV-B radiation, lifestyles and concerns about the risks of sun exposure may lead to insufficient exposure and to vitamin D deficiency. In these situations, dietary intake of vitamin D from foods or supplements is important for maintaining optimal vitamin D status. Some foods, such as fatty fish and fish liveroils, certain meats, eggs, mushrooms, dairy, and fortified foods, can provide significant amounts of vitamin D when considered cumulatively across the diet. However, little research has focussed on assessing edible plant foods for potential vitamin D content. The biosynthesis of vitamin D in animals, fungi and yeasts is well established; it is less well known that vitamin D is also biosynthesised in plants. Research dates back to the early 1900s, beginning with in vivo experiments showing the anti-rachitic activity of plants consumed by animals with induced rickets, and in vitro experiments using analytical methods with limited sensitivity. The most sensitive, specific and reliable method for measuring vitamin D and its metabolites is by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These assays have only recently been customised to allow measurement in foods, including plant materials.

This work describes the potential use of isothermal microcalorimetry to monitor the oxidation of linoleic acid, an important conjugated fatty acid responsible for the development of rancidity. The heat flow signal developed during the oxidation process reflects a multistep mechanism typical of radical chain reactions. From the analysis of the thermograms, it is possible to identify a period of the reaction that occurs with an order equal to 0.5. This period is correlated with the propagation period of the radical chain reaction. In addition, it allows detecting the early appearance of rancidity notes, as confirmed with the analysis of the samples headspace by Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS). The proposed approach was finally applied to compare the capacity of natural and synthetic antioxidants to inhibit the oxidation process of linoleic acid and the occurrence of rancidity.

28060498,"The aromatic descriptor ""green"", reflecting grape unripeness in French red wines, is frequently associated with the levels of 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines, particularly 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP), which has bell pepper nuances. Nevertheless, not all green aromatic expressions in red wines correlate with 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazine concentrations. This study considered sensory and chemical approaches using Cabernet Sauvignon wines obtained from grapes harvested at one-month intervals during the 2014 and 2015 vintages to investigate other volatile odoriferous compounds. Semipreparative HPLC fractionation of wine extracts revealed a fraction with specific green aromas in the early harvest wines. Its sensory impact was confirmed by omission and reconstitution tests. Then, multidimensional gas chromatography coupled with olfactometry and mass spectrometry (MDGC-O-MS/TOF) was used for molecular characterization of the aroma compounds associated with the green aromas. Surprisingly, eucalyptol (1,8-cineole), with menthol odor was highlighted and assayed at concentrations sometimes above its olfactory detection threshold in Cabernet Sauvignon and Fer Servadou wines. Sensory tests confirmed its impact at several concentrations detected in French red wines (up to 2.61 ± 0.03 μg/L) on the menthol nuance and overall green perception, particularly via an additive effect with IBMP. Quantitation of 1,8-cineole in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes during berry development in 2015 revealed its varietal origin with abundant concentrations in unripe berries and decrease during grape maturation. Moreover, the implication of an invasive plant (Artemisia verlotiorum) growing in certain vineyards was shown to be responsible for increased 1,8-cineole concentrations in some wines.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D019306', 'D002851', 'D003511', 'D000077591', 'D005504', 'D005602', 'D006801', 'D058865', 'D013058', 'D039821', 'D009812', 'D064367', 'D011719', 'D027843', 'D055549', 'D014920']","['Artemisia', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclohexanols', 'Eucalyptol', 'Food Analysis', 'France', 'Humans', 'Introduced Species', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Monoterpenes', 'Odorants', 'Olfactometry', 'Pyrazines', 'Vitis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Wine']","1,8-Cineole in French Red Wines: Evidence for a Contribution Related to Its Various Origins.","[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', None, None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28060498,2017

We therefore measured concentrations of aflatoxins (AFs) and ochratoxin A (OTA) in RCPs from areas of low, medium, and high incidence of GBC in India, and compared these concentrations with GBC incidence in each area. Twentyone RCP samples were collected from nine cities (eight from a lowincidence area, five from a mediumincidence area, and eight from a highincidence area). Concentrations of AFs and OTA were measured using highperformance liquid chromatography. No significant differences in mean concentrations of AFs and OTA were found in the three areas.

GO/SiO2-MISPE monolithic columns for RB detection were prepared by optimizing the supporting substrate, template, and polymerizing monomer under mild water bath conditions. Adsorption capacity and specificity, which are critical properties for the application of the GO/SiO2-MISPE monolithic column, were investigated. GO/SiO2-MIP was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. The recovery and the intraday and interday relative standard deviations for RB ranged from 83.7% to 88.4% and 2.5% to 4.0% and the enrichment factors were higher than 110-fold. The chip-based array columns effectively eliminated impurities in chili powder, indicating that the chip-based GO/SiO2-MISPE method was reliable for RB detection in food samples using high-performance liquid chromatography.

27156753,"For the rapid simultaneous determination of monosodium glutamate (MSG), benzoic acid (BA), and sorbic acid (SA) in canned food and other processed food samples, we developed a method that combines in-capillary derivatization with separation by capillary electrophoresis. This method employs the rapid derivatization of MSG with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) in the presence of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) and enables the detection of the resulting OPA-MSG derivative and of non-derivatized BA and SA at 230nm. The composition of the background electrolyte and the parameters of derivatization and separation are as follows: 25mM borax containing 5mM OPA and 6mM 3-MPA, separation voltage 25mV, injection at 30mbar for 20s, and column temperature 25°C. Because of the high reaction rate and suitably adapted effective electrophoretic mobilities, band broadening due to the derivatization reaction at the start of the separation process is kept to a minimum. The optimized method is validated with respect to LOD, LOQ, linearity, recovery, and precision. This method can be applied to real samples such as soy, fish, oyster and sweet and sour chili sauces after application of appropriate clean-up steps. Mechanisms of zone broadening and zone focusing are discussed showing the validity of the employed theoretical approach regarding the dependence of the peak shape for OPA-MSG on the concentration of MSG in the sample.

27129773,"The green odor of plants is characterized by green leaf volatiles (GLVs) composed of C6 compounds. GLVs are biosynthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acids in thylakoid membranes by a series of enzymes. A representative member of GLVs (E)-2-hexenal, known as the leaf aldehyde, has been assumed to be produced by isomerization from (Z)-3-hexenal in the biosynthesis pathway; however, the enzyme has not yet been identified. In this study, we purified the (Z)-3:(E)-2-hexenal isomerase (HI) from paprika fruits and showed that various plant species have homologous HIs. Purified HI is a homotrimeric protein of 110 kDa composed of 35-kDa subunits and shows high activity at acidic and neutral pH values. Phylogenetic analysis showed that HIs belong to the cupin superfamily, and at least three catalytic amino acids (His, Lys, Tyr) are conserved in HIs of various plant species. Enzymatic isomerization of (Z)-3-hexenal in the presence of deuterium oxide resulted in the introduction of deuterium at the C4 position of (E)-2-hexenal, and a suicide substrate 3-hexyn-1-al inhibited HI irreversibly, suggesting that the catalytic mode of HI is a keto-enol tautomerism reaction mode mediated by a catalytic His residue. The gene expression of HIs in Solanaceae plants was enhanced in specific developmental stages and by wounding treatment.

27086018,"The packed nanofiber solid-phase extraction of crude extracts of a mass viscous sample is challenging because the interference and recalcitrant particulates in the sample may attach to the nanofiber and block the column, which leads to insufficient sample extraction. A novel concentric layered nanofiber solid-phase extraction (SPE) column using polystyrene-based electrospun nanofiber as the stationary phase has been employed for the pretreatment of mass viscous crude extracts. The layered column was fabricated by using untouched nanofiber with its natural morphology rather than hand-packing of spoiled fiber to the control packing density of the column. In the novel column, the SPE packed bed was divided into a multi-layer structure to provide uniform radial and axial packing and to part the mobile phase stream by the isolated layer with great superiority in aspects such as lower column pressure and faster elution speed. The feasibility and efficiency of the LFSPE column were then evaluated via determination of rhodamine B (RB) from spiked chili samples. Based on the LFSPE column, a linear spiked calibration curve in the range of 0.02-5 mg/kg was obtained.

The method performance, including linearity, recovery, limits of detection (LOD), and quantitation (LOQ), was satisfactory. Throughout the experimental period, the residual levels of flonicamid and TFNG were not uniform, whereas that of TFNA remained constant. The total sum of the residues (flonicamid and its metabolites) was higher in the vinyl house with shade cover than in the glass house, under various conditions.

High humidity leads to decreases in the total sum of flonicamid residues in red bell pepper grown in a glass house, because it leads to an increase in the rate of water loss, which in turn accelerates the volatilization of the pesticide.

Twenty-seven out of 31 (87.1%) packed red pepper flake samples contained OTA at concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 μg kg(-1), whereas 100% of the unpacked red pepper flake samples contained OTA, in the range 1.1-31.7 μg( )kg(-1). Overall, only 4 unpacked samples (5.3%) contained OTA, with a mean value of 23.4 μg kg(-1), which is higher than the European Union limit. It is suggested that OTA content should be carefully considered in red pepper flake samples especially marketed in unpacked form. ","Food additives & contaminants.

26549520,"This investigation was undertaken to compare the dissipation pattern of flubendiamide in capsicum fruits under poly-house and open field after giving spray applications at the recommended and double doses of 48 g a.i. ha(-1) and 96 g a.i. ha(-1). Extraction and purification of capsicum fruit samples were carried out by the QuEChERS method. Residues of flubendiamide and its metabolite, des-iodo flubendiamide, were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array, and confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Limit of quantification of the method was 0.05 mg kg(-1), and recovery of the insecticides was in the range of 89.6-104.3%, with relative standard deviation being 4.5-11.5%. The measurement uncertainty of the analytical method was in the range of 10.7-15.7%. Initial residue deposits of flubendiamide on capsicum fruits grown under poly-house conditions were (0.977 and 1.834 mg kg(-1)) higher than that grown in the field (0.665 and 1.545 mg kg(-1)). Flubendiamide residues persisted for 15 days in field-grown and for 25 days in poly-house-grown capsicum fruits. The residues were degraded with the half-lives of 4.3-4.7 and 5.6-6.6 days in field and poly-house respectively. Des-iodo flubendiamide was not detected in capsicum fruits or soil. The residues of flubendiamide degraded to below the maximum residue limit notified by Codex Alimentarius Commission (FAO/WHO) after 1 and 6 days in open field, and 3 and 10 days in poly-house. The results of the study indicated that flubendiamide applied to capsicum under controlled environmental conditions required longer pre-harvest interval to allow its residues to dissipate to the safe level.","Journal of environmental science and health.

26334135,"The sweetpotato whitefly (WF), Bemisia tabaci, is a major pest that damages a wide range of vegetable crops in Malaysia. WF infestation is influenced by a variety of factors, including previous infestation of the host plant by other insect pests. This study investigated the effects of previous infestation of host chilli plants by the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) on the olfactory behavioural response of B. tabaci, using free-choice bioassay with a Y-tube olfactometer. We analysed volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by non-infested and M. persicae-infested chilli plants using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our results showed that female WFs preferred non-infested to pre-infested plants. Collection and analysis of volatile compounds emitted by infested plants confirmed that there were significant increases in the production of monoterpenes (cymene; 1,8-cineole), sesquiterpenes (β-cadinene, α-copaene), and methyl salicylate (MeSA) compared to non-infested plants. Our results suggest that host plant infestation by aphids may induce production of secondary metabolites that deter B. tabaci from settling on its host plants. These results provide important information for understanding WF host selection and dispersal among crops, and also for manipulating WF behaviour to improve IPM in chilli.

26320485,"Our previous study detected aflatoxins in red chili peppers from Chile, Bolivia, and Peru, each of which have a high incidence of gallbladder cancer (GBC). Since the aflatoxin B1 concentration was not so high in these peppers, it is important to clarify the presence of other mycotoxins. Here we attempted to determine any associations between the concentrations of aflatoxins and ochratoxin A (OTA) in red chili peppers, and the corresponding GBC incidences. We collected red chili peppers from three areas in Peru: Trujillo (a high GBC incidence area), Cusco (an intermediate GBC incidence area), and Lima (a low GBC incidence rate), and from Chile and Bolivia. Aflatoxins and OTA were extracted with organic solvents. The concentrations of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2, and OTA were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The values obtained were compared with the incidence of GBC in each area or country. All of the red chili peppers from the three areas showed contamination with aflatoxins below the Commission of the European Communities (EC) recommended limits (5 μg/kg), but the OTA contamination of two samples was above the EC recommended limit (15 μg/kg). The mean concentrations of OTA in the peppers from Chile (mean 355 μg/kg, range <5-1,059 μg/kg) and Bolivia (mean 207 μg/kg, range 0.8-628 μg/kg), which has a high incidence of GBC, were higher than that in Peru (14 μg/kg, range <5-47 μg/kg), which has an intermediate GBC incidence. The OTA contamination in the red chili peppers from Chile, Bolivia, and Peru was stronger than that of aflatoxins.

Although the transport of lipophilic molecules across the cuticle has been intensively studied, development of tools to measure the cuticle polarity has received little attention. We developed a rapid and simple analytical method to evaluate the polarity of cuticles in situ. This method uses Prodan, 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylaminonaphthalene), a medium-sensitive fluorescent probe. Tests on model surfaces with varied polarity (i.e., wax paraffin, polyethylene, C18) were carried out to test the feasibility of the measurement and to optimize the application of Prodan. Moreover, on the basis of the Kamlet-Taft solvatochromic comparison method, a relationship between the emission characteristics of Prodan and the number of carbon atoms in primary alcohols mimicking the solid medium was established. After optimization, the method was validated on three natural plant cuticles (leaf of Zamiifolia, skin of green pepper, and skin of white grape).

26129984,"A novel adsorbent composed of silica coated magnetic microparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2) and graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with phenylethyl amine (PEA) was synthesized and characterized using Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and CHN elemental analysis techniques. The adsorbent (Fe3O4@SiO2@GO-PEA) was then used in a magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of six organophosphorous pesticides (OPPs) including methyl parathion, fenitrothion, methidathion, ethion, methyl azinphos and coumaphos prior to gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus detection (GC-NPD). The fabricated adsorbent combines the advantages of superior adsorption capability of modified GO and magnetic separability of magnetite microparticles to provide high adsorption capacity, and easy isolation from sample solutions. The main experimental parameters affecting the extraction recovery of OPPs including extraction time, pH, adsorbent dosage, salt concentration, and desorption conditions were investigated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, linear responses were obtained in the concentration range of 0.06-200μgL(-1) with the determination coefficients (R(2)) between 0.9945 and 0.9996. The limits of detection were from 0.02 to 0.1μgL(-1) and the intraday and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 4.8 and 6.4%, respectively. The method was successfully applied for determination of the OPPs in apple, grape, pear, bell pepper, celery and water samples. The obtained recoveries were in the range of 90.4-108.0% (RSDs=1.9-6.6%, n=3) for fruits and vegetables, and 94.6-104.2% (RSDs=2.0-4.8%, n=3) for water samples. The excellent extraction performance of the adsorbent can be attributed to its structure characteristics where the phenyl rings of PEA grafted on the GO nanosheets are accessible to interact effectively with OPPs via delocalized π-electron system.

25913852,"Pepper fruits in green and red maturation stages were selected to study the protein pattern modified by oxidation measuring carbonylated proteins in isolated mitochondria, together with the accumulation of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide in the fruits. MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis identified as carbonylated proteins in both green and red fruits, formate dehydrogenase, NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, porin, and defensin, pointing to a common regulation by carbonylation of these proteins independently of the maturation stage. However, other proteins such as glycine dehydrogenase P subunit and phosphate transporter were identified as targets of carbonylation only in green fruits, whereas aconitase, ATPase β subunit, prohibitin, orfB protein, and cytochrome C oxidase, were identified only in red fruits. In general, the results suggest that carbonylation of mitochondrial proteins is a PTM that drives the complex ripening process, probably establishing the accumulation and functionality of some mitochondrial proteins in the nonclimacteric pepper fruit.

Typically, CNTF was immersed into the diluted solution of chilli oil for extraction, which was then placed directly under the visible plasma beam tip of the DCBI source for desorption and ionization. Under optimized conditions, five dyes were simultaneously determined using this method. Results showed that the analytes were enriched by the CNTF through the π-π interactions, and the proposed method could significantly improve the sensitivities of these compounds, compared to the direct analysis by DCBI-MS/MS. The method with a linear range of 0.08-12.8 μg g(-1) and good linear relationships (R(2) > 0.93) in a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was developed. Satisfactory reproducibility was achieved. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 20.0%. The recoveries ranged from 80.0 to 110.0%, and the limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 1.4-21 ng g(-1). Finally, the feasibility of the method was further exhibited by the determination of five illegal dyes in chilli powder. These results demonstrate that the proposed method consumes less time and solvent than conventional HPLC-based methods and avoids the contamination of chromatographic column and ion source from non-volatile oil.

Chili powder and chili oil samples were first extracted with acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) and acetonitrile, respectively. Then, RB from the extract was adsorbed to the polymer cation exchange (PCX) sorbent with the characteristics of ion exchange and reversed-phase retention. Subsequently, the analyte in PCX sorbent was eluted with ammonium hydroxide/methanol (1:99, v/v) through a simple unit device equipped with 1 mL syringe and 0.22 μm nylon syringe filter. All of the samples were analyzed by UHPLC–HRMS/MS on a Waters Acquity BEH C18 column with 0.1% formic acid and 4 mM ammonium formate in water/acetonitrile as the mobile phase with gradient elution. The matrix effect, recovery, and repeatability, within laboratory reproducibility, and the LODs and LOQs of the r-dSPE cleanup method were investigated. The method showed a good linearity (R2 > 0.999) in the ranges of 0.01–1 μg/L and 1–100 μg/L for the analyte. The LODs of RB for chili powder and chili oil samples were 0.5 μg/kg. The average recoveries of RB from the samples spiked at four different concentrations (2, 20, 500 and 5000 μg/kg) were in a range from 76.7 to 104.9%.

25495653,"This manuscript reports a new pesticide residue analysis method employing a microflow-liquid chromatography system coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (microflow-LC-ESI-QqQ-MS). This uses an electrospray ionization source with a narrow tip emitter to generate smaller droplets. A validation study was undertaken to establish performance characteristics for this new approach on 90 pesticide residues, including their degradation products, in three commodities (tomato, pepper, and orange). The significant benefits of the microflow-LC-MS/MS-based method were a high sensitivity gain and a notable reduction in matrix effects delivered by a dilution of the sample (up to 30-fold); this is as a result of competition reduction between the matrix compounds and analytes for charge during ionization. Overall robustness and a capability to withstand long analytical runs using the microflow-LC-MS system have been demonstrated (for 100 consecutive injections without any maintenance being required). Quality controls based on the results of internal standards added at the samples' extraction, dilution, and injection steps were also satisfactory. The LOQ values were mostly 5 μg kg(-1) for almost all pesticide residues. Other benefits were a substantial reduction in solvent usage and waste disposal as well as a decrease in the run-time. The method was successfully applied in the routine analysis of 50 fruit and vegetable samples labeled as organically produced.

Three groups of HAs, imidazopyridines (PhIP, DMIP, and 1,5,6-TMIP), imidazoquinoxalines (MeIQx and 4,8-DiMeIQx), and β-carbolines (harman and norharman), were detected and quantified in all of the samples. The results demonstrated that the total HA and imidazopyridine profiles could clearly be affected by 1% pricklyash peel (14.1 ± 0.76 and 6.06 ± 0.32 ng/g), chilli (41.0 ± 0.01 and 23.0 ± 0.52 ng/g), and cumin (59.9 ± 2.44 and 31.1 ± 3.06 ng/g), in comparison with control values of 21.8 ± 2.40 and 14.3 ± 2.04 ng/g, respectively.

25175039,"An LC-MS/MS ""dilute and shoot"" method for the determination of 295 fungal and bacterial metabolites was optimized and validated according to the guidelines established in the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs of the European Commission (SANCO) document No. 12495/2011. Four different types of food matrices were chosen for validation: apple puree for infants (high water content), hazelnuts (high fat content), maize (high starch and low fat content) and green pepper (difficult or unique matrix). Method accuracy and precision was evaluated using spiked samples in five replicates at two concentration levels. Method trueness was demonstrated through participation in various proficiency tests. Although the method covers a total number of 331 analytes, validation data were acquired only for 295 analytes, either due to the non-availability of analytical standards or due other reasons described in this paper. Concerning the apparent recovery, the percentage of 295 analytes matching the acceptable recovery range of 70-120% lied down by SANCO varied from 21% in green pepper to 74% in apple puree at the highest spiking level. At the levels close to limit of quantification only 20-58% of the analytes fulfilled this criterion. The extent of matrix effects was strongly dependent on the analyte/matrix combination. In general, the lowest matrix effects were observed in apple puree (59% of analytes were not influenced by enhancement/suppression at all at the highest validation level). The highest matrix effects were observed in green pepper, where only 10% of analytes did not suffer from signal suppression/enhancement. The repeatability of the method was acceptable (RSD≤20) for 97% of all analytes in apple puree and hazelnuts, for 95% in maize and for 89% in green pepper. Concerning the trueness of the method, Z-scores were generally between -2 and 2, despite a broad variety of different matrices. Based on these results it can be concluded that quantitative determination of mycotoxins by LC-MS/MS based on a ""dilute and shoot"" approach is also feasible in case of complex matrices.

Online solid-phase extraction was performed on the synthesized monolithic column using 10 mM ammonium acetate solution as the loading solution with the aid of an online cleanup chromatography system. The desorption of Sudan I-IV was achieved with acetonitrile as the eluting solution at the flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The extracted analytes were subsequently eluted into a C18 analytical column for chromatographic separation using a mixture of 10% acetonitrile/90% formic acid (0.5%) solution as the mobile phase.

Specifically, 31, 36, and 41 compounds were identified in healthy, medium-infected, and severely infected chili powder. Among these compounds, acetic acid (13.77%), propanal (2.477%), N-methylpyrrole (1.986%), and 2-methyl-propanal (1.768%) were leading volatiles in the healthy chili powder. In contrast, infected chili powder contained 9,12-octadecadienoic acid, ethyl ester (15.984%), acetic acid (11.249%), hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester (3.3%), N-methylpyrrole (3.221%), and 2-furanmethanol (2.629%) as major compounds. Trimethylamine and isosorbide were detected in both medium and severely infected chili, but not in healthy chili. This means that these compounds could be used as biomarkers to distinguish between healthy and infected chili. The proposed technique was applied to 12 commercial chili powders, and trimethylamine and isosorbide were detected in six samples.

24590604,"The reasons why some cultivars of hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) accumulate low levels of Cd are poorly understood. We aimed to compare the characteristics of Cd uptake and translocation in low-Cd and high-Cd hot pepper cultivars by determining the subcellular locations and chemical forms of Cd, and its distribution among different plant organs. We conducted a hydroponic experiment to investigate the subcellular distribution and chemical forms of Cd in roots, stems, and leaves of a low-Cd (Yeshengchaotianjiao, YCT) and a high-Cd cultivar (Jinfuzaohuangjiao, JFZ). The results showed that the concentrations of Cd in almost all subcellular fractions of roots, and in all chemical forms in roots, were higher in YCT than in JFZ. Compared with YCT, JFZ had higher Cd concentrations in almost all subcellular fractions of stems and leaves, and higher Cd concentrations in almost all chemical forms in stems and leaves. Additionally, YCT had significantly higher total Cd accumulation but a lower Cd translocation rate compared with JFZ. In general, the results presented in this study revealed that root-to-shoot Cd translocation via the xylem is the key physiological processes determining the Cd accumulation level in stems and leaves of hot pepper plants. Immobilization of Cd by the cell walls of different organs is important in Cd detoxification and limiting the symplastic movement of Cd.

24236083,"The genus Capsicum is New World in origin and represents a complex of a wide variety of both wild and domesticated taxa. Peppers or fruits of Capsicum species rarely have been identified in the paleoethnobotanical record in either Meso- or South America. We report here confirmation of Capsicum sp. residues from pottery samples excavated at Chiapa de Corzo in southern Mexico dated from Middle to Late Preclassic periods (400 BCE to 300 CE). Residues from 13 different pottery types were collected and extracted using standard techniques. Presence of Capsicum was confirmed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/MS-MS Analysis. Five pottery types exhibited chemical peaks for Capsicum when compared to the standard (dihydrocapsaicin). No peaks were observed in the remaining eight samples. Results of the chemical extractions provide conclusive evidence for Capsicum use at Chiapas de Corzo during a 700 year period (400 BCE-300 CE). Presence of Capsicum in different types of culinary-associated pottery raises questions how chili pepper could have been used during this early time period. As Pre-Columbian cacao products sometimes were flavored using Capsicum, the same pottery sample set was tested for evidence of cacao using a theobromine marker: these results were negative. As each vessel that tested positive for Capsicum had a culinary use we suggest here the possibility that chili residues from the Chiapas de Corzo pottery samples reflect either paste or beverage preparations for religious, festival, or every day culinary use. Alternatively, some vessels that tested positive merely could have been used to store peppers. Most interesting from an archaeological context was the presence of Capsicum residue obtained from a spouted jar, a pottery type previously thought only to be used for pouring liquids.

24147886,"The fundamental structure of capsinoids is a fatty acid ester with vanillyl alcohol, whereas in capsaicinoids, a fatty acid amide is linked to vanillylamine. To clarify the relationship between their biosynthesis in Capsicum plants, we carried out an in vivo tracer experiment using stable isotopically labeled putative precursors. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the uptake of isotopes into metabolites after injection of the labeled precursors into intact fruits of a pungent cultivar, Peru, and a non-pungent cultivar, CH-19 Sweet. Labeled vanillylamine was incorporated into capsaicinoids in both cultivars. While labeled vanillyl alcohol was incorporated into capsinoids in both cultivars, the accumulation of intact capsaicinoids in Peru was suppressed by over 60% after administration of vanillyl alcohol. In Peru, labeled vanillin was converted to both vanillylamine and, in 5-fold excess, vanillyl alcohol. Moreover, labeled vanillin was converted exclusively to vanillyl alcohol in CH-19 Sweet. These data are consistent with the incorporation of labeled vanillin into capsaicinoids and capsinoids in both cultivars. We conclude that pungent cultivars are highly potent producers of vanillyl alcohol that is incorporated into capsinoids and that biosynthesis of capsinoids is catalyzed by capsaicin synthase.

Other fraction composed of two peptides, in which the major peptide also showed similarity to thionins. Among the obtained fractions, fraction 1, which is composed of a single peptide of 7 kDa, was sequenced by Edman method and its comparative sequence analysis in database (nr) showed similarity to thionin-like peptides. Tests against microorganisms, fraction 1 presented inhibitory activity to the cells of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis and caused growth reduction to the bacteria species Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fraction 3 caused inhibitory activity only for C. albicans and C. tropicalis. This fraction was composed of two peptides of ∼7 and 10 kDa, and the main protein band correspondent to the 7 kDa peptide, also showed similarity to thionins.

Products containing chili peppers and salt were often suspected as sources of lead contamination, and included items such as candy that are routinely investigated. However, products such as hot sauces that contain similar ingredients have not been the focus of evaluations. This study quantified lead concentrations in imported hot sauces, evaluated product compliance to existing United States standards, and calculated potential dietary lead exposure for children using the Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model. Finally, recommendations for reducing the risk of lead exposure from hot sauces are provided. Twenty-five (25) bottles of imported hot sauces manufactured in Mexico and South America were purchased in Clark County, Nevada. All hot sauces were analyzed for lead concentrations, pH, and leaded packaging. Hot sauces were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and packaging was analyzed using x-ray fluorescence technology. Four brands of hot sauces (16%) exceeded 0.1 ppm lead, the current FDA action level for lead in candy. Hot sauces with lead concentrations >0.1 ppm lead contained salt and were manufactured in Mexico. Subsequent analysis of additional lots of hot sauces exceeding 0.1 ppm lead revealed inconsistent lead concentrations between and within manufacturer lots. The lead concentrations of the plastic hot sauce lids ranged from below the limit of detection to 2,028 ppm lead. There was no association between lead concentrations in hot sauces and pepper type. These results indicate the need for more rigorous screening protocols for products imported from Mexico, the establishment of an applicable standard for hot sauce, and resources to allow for the enforcement of existing food safety policies.

In this study, a solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS) method has been developed to detect the trace residues of three capsaicinoids (capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin and nonylic acid vanillylamide) in cooking oil. The oil sample was first extracted with 20 g/L sodium hydroxide, the C18 SPE cartridge was then used to clean-up the sample and enrich the analytes before the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detection. With this method, sixty seven blind samples provided by China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment were analyzed. The results showed that the capsaicinoids are good evaluation indices for the identification of ICO. In all the 48 ICO samples, 36 samples were successfully recognized. All the 19 normal oil samples were accurately identified. This method has been chosen and authorized as one of the four standard instrumental identification methods for ICO by the National Ministry of Health of China.",Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,"['D002211', 'D002212', 'D002853', 'D003296', 'D013058', 'D009821']","['Capsaicin', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cooking', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oils']",[A novel method for the identification of illegal cooking oil (1): detection of three capsaicinoids with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry].,"['Q000031', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","['analogs & derivatives', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23451509,2014

23314817,"Chromoplasts are unique plastids that accumulate massive amounts of carotenoids. To gain a general and comparative characterization of chromoplast proteins, this study performed proteomic analysis of chromoplasts from six carotenoid-rich crops: watermelon, tomato, carrot, orange cauliflower, red papaya, and red bell pepper. Stromal and membrane proteins of chromoplasts were separated by 1D gel electrophoresis and analysed using nLC-MS/MS. A total of 953-2262 proteins from chromoplasts of different crop species were identified. Approximately 60% of the identified proteins were predicted to be plastid localized. Functional classification using MapMan bins revealed large numbers of proteins involved in protein metabolism, transport, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and redox in chromoplasts from all six species. Seventeen core carotenoid metabolic enzymes were identified. Phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, ζ-carotene desaturase, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 were found in almost all crops, suggesting relative abundance of them among the carotenoid pathway enzymes. Chromoplasts from different crops contained abundant amounts of ATP synthase and adenine nucleotide translocator, which indicates an important role of ATP production and transport in chromoplast development. Distinctive abundant proteins were observed in chromoplast from different crops, including capsanthin/capsorubin synthase and fibrillins in pepper, superoxide dismutase in watermelon, carrot, and cauliflower, and glutathione-S-transferease in papaya. The comparative analysis of chromoplast proteins among six crop species offers new insights into the general metabolism and function of chromoplasts as well as the uniqueness of chromoplasts in specific crop species.

If the development of gallbladder cancer (GBC) in Chile is associated with a high level of consumption of aflatoxin-contaminated red chili peppers, such peppers from other countries having a high GBC incidence rate may also be contaminated with aflatoxins. We aimed to determine whether this might be the case for red chili peppers from Bolivia and Peru. A total of 7 samples (3 from Bolivia, 4 from Peru) and 3 controls (2 from China, 1 from Japan) were evaluated. Aflatoxins were extracted with acetonitrile:water (9:1, v/v) and eluted through an immuno-affinity column. The concentrations of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and then the detected aflatoxins were identified using HPLC-mass spectrometry. In some but not all of the samples from Bolivia and Peru, aflatoxin B1 or aflatoxins B1 and B2 were detected. In particular, aflatoxin B1 or total aflatoxin concentrations in a Bolivian samples were above the maximum levels for aflatoxins in spices proposed by the European Commission. Red chili peppers from Bolivia and Peru consumed by populations having high GBC incidence rates would appear to be contaminated with aflatoxins.

23124390,"Pepper fruit is typically red, but green, orange and yellow cultivars are gaining consumer acceptance. This color variation is mainly due to variations in carotenoid composition. Orange color in pepper can result from a number of carotenoid profiles, but its genetic basis is only partly known. We identified an EMS-induced orange-fruited mutant using the wild-type blocky red-fruited cultivar 'Maor' as progenitor. This mutant accumulates mainly β-carotene in its fruit, instead of the complex pattern of red and yellow carotenoids in 'Maor'. We identified an A(709) to G transition in the cDNA of β-CAROTENE HYDROXYLASE2 in the orange pepper and complete co-segregation of this single-nucleotide polymorphism with the mutated phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that β-CAROTENE HYDROXYLASE2 controls the orange mutation in pepper. Interestingly, the expression of β-CAROTENE HYDROXYLASE2 and additional carotenogenesis genes was elevated in the orange fruit compared with the red fruit, indicating possible feedback regulation of genes in the pathway. Because carotenoids serve as precursors for volatile compounds, we compared the volatile profiles of the two parents. The orange pepper contained more volatile compounds than 'Maor', with predominant elevation of norisoprenoids derived from β-carotene degradation, while sesquiterpenes predominated in the red fruit. Because of the importance of β-carotene as a provitamin A precursor in the human diet, the orange-fruited mutant might serve as a natural source for pepper fruit biofortification.

The present research presents data on the isolation and characterization of Capsicum chinense Jacq. peptides which were scrutinized in relation to their toxicity towards a diverse set of yeast species. The protein extract was separated with C18 reverse-phase chromatography in high performance liquid chromatography, resulting in three different peptide enriched fractions (PEFs) termed PEF1, PEF2 and PEF3. Tricine-SDS-PAGE of the PEF2 revealed peptides with molecular masses of approximately 5.0 and 8.5 kDa. These PEFs also exhibited strong antifungal activity against different yeasts. In the presence of the PEF2, Candida tropicalis exhibited morphological changes, including cellular agglomeration and formation of pseudohyphae. Determined N-terminal sequences of PEF2 and PEF3 were proven to be highly homologous to serine proteinase inhibitors, when analysed by comparative database sequence tools.

Pesticide residues were extracted from green pepper surfaces by swabbing  them with absorbent cotton moistened with acetone or acetonitrile. After spraying of pesticides, the extraction rate decreased gradually, except for thiacloprid. Presumably, extraction rates depend on the physicochemical properties of pesticides, especially water solubility. It was thought that the applicability of the proposed method greatly depended on the systemic speed of each pesticide, and water solubility was placed as the index that was important to  making certain.

22813205,"The rapidly growing demand for organic food requires the availability of analytical tools enabling their authentication. Recently, metabolomic fingerprinting/profiling has been demonstrated as a challenging option for a comprehensive characterisation of small molecules occurring in plants, since their pattern may reflect the impact of various external factors. In a two-year pilot study, concerned with the classification of organic versus conventional crops, ambient mass spectrometry consisting of a direct analysis in real time (DART) ion source and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) was employed. This novel methodology was tested on 40 tomato and 24 pepper samples grown under specified conditions. To calculate statistical models, the obtained data (mass spectra) were processed by the principal component analysis (PCA) followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The results from the positive ionisation mode enabled better differentiation between organic and conventional samples than the results from the negative mode. In this case, the recognition ability obtained by LDA was 97.5% for tomato and 100% for pepper samples and the prediction abilities were above 80% for both sample sets. The results suggest that the year of production had stronger influence on the metabolomic fingerprints compared with the type of farming (organic versus conventional). In any case, DART-TOFMS is a promising tool for rapid screening of samples. Establishing comprehensive (multi-sample) long-term databases may further help to improve the quality of statistical classification models.","Food additives & contaminants.

22685169,"Integrative comparative analyses of transcript and metabolite levels from climacteric and nonclimacteric fruits can be employed to unravel the similarities and differences of the underlying regulatory processes. To this end, we conducted combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and heterologous microarray hybridization assays in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum; climacteric) and pepper (Capsicum chilense; nonclimacteric) fruits across development and ripening. Computational methods from multivariate and network-based analyses successfully revealed the difference between the covariance structures of the integrated data sets. Moreover, our results suggest that both fruits have similar ethylene-mediated signaling components; however, their regulation is different and may reflect altered ethylene sensitivity or regulators other than ethylene in pepper. Genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis were not induced in pepper fruits. Nevertheless, genes downstream of ethylene perception such as cell wall metabolism genes, carotenoid biosynthesis genes, and the never-ripe receptor were clearly induced in pepper as in tomato fruit. While signaling sensitivity or actual signals may differ between climacteric and nonclimacteric fruit, the evidence described here suggests that activation of a common set of ripening genes influences metabolic traits. Also, a coordinate regulation of transcripts and the accumulation of key organic acids, including malate, citrate, dehydroascorbate, and threonate, in pepper fruit were observed.

Headspace analysis was performed by a Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometer (SIFT-MS). After blanching, (Z)-3-hexenal had a large significant decrease in concentration since it is a heat labile compound while most other volatiles did not change in concentration.

Samples including paprika, soils, and stems collected from seven fields in the Xinjiang Region, China, were detected by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Far from any anthropogenic addition, the ultratrace RhB concentrations in all the paprika samples provided unambiguous evidence that environmental RhB contamination in paprika had really occurred over its growth period. Further illation suggests that the soil contaminated by RhB is one of the major contamination sources and that there may be a degradation of RhB in paprika during the late maturation stage. The discovery has significant implications for re-evaluating the origin of the RhB in paprika- and chilli-containing products.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002212', 'D002681', 'D004396', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D012235', 'D012989']","['Capsicum', 'China', 'Coloring Agents', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Rhodamines', 'Soil Pollutants']",Discovery of environmental rhodamine B contamination in paprika during the vegetation process.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22524706,2012
22451064,"A fast and sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of Sudan dyes (I, II, III, and IV) in food samples was developed for the first time using partial filling micellar electrokinectic chromatography-mass spectrometry (MEKC-MS). The use of MEKC was essential to achieve the separation of these neutral analytes, while the partial filling technique was necessary to avoid the contamination of the ion source with non-volatile micelles. MEKC separation and MS detection conditions were optimized in order to achieve a fast, efficient, and sensitive separation of the four dyes. Filling 25% of the capillary with an MEKC solution containing 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 25 mM SDS, and 32.5% (v/v) acetonitrile, a baseline separation of the four azo-dyes was obtained in 10 min. Tandem MS was investigated in order to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the analysis. Limits of detection (LOD) values 5, 8, 15, and 29 times better were obtained for Sudan III, I, II, and IV, respectively, using partial filling MEKC-MS/MS instead of partial filling MEKC-MS. Under optimized conditions, LOD from 0.05 to 0.2 μg/mL were obtained. The suitability of the developed method was demonstrated through the fast and sensitive determination of Sudan I, II, III, and IV in spiked chilli powder samples.

Absolute threshold and JND were determined using 2 alternative forced-choice sensory tests tests. High-performance liquid chromatography technique was used to determine capsaicinoids concentration in samples used for sensory analysis. Sensory absolute threshold was 0.050 mg capsaicinoids/kg sample. Five JND values were determined using 5 reference solutions with different capsaicinoids concentration. JND values changed proportionally as capsaicinoids concentration of the reference sample solutions changed. Weber fraction remained stable for the first 4 reference capsaicinoid solutions (0.05, 0.11, 0.13, and 0.17 mg/kg) but changed when the most concentrated reference capsaicinoids solution was used (0.23 mg/kg). Quantification limit for instrumental analysis was 1.512 mg/kg capsaicinoids. Sensory methods employed in this study proved to be more sensitive than instrumental methods. Practical Application: A better understanding of the process involved in the sensory perception of pungency is currently required because ""hot"" foods are becoming more popular in western cuisine. Absolute thresholds and differential thresholds are useful tools in the formulation and development of new food products.

22098923,"An internal fruit rot disease of sweet peppers was first detected in Belgium in 2003. Research conducted mostly in Canada indicates that this disease is primarily caused by Fusarium lactis Pirotta. Ninety-eight Fusarium isolates obtained from diseased sweet peppers from Belgium, as well as from other countries (Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) were identified by sequencing the translation elongation factor 1α (EF). Of these 98 isolates, 13 were identified as F. oxysporum Schltdl., nine as F. proliferatum (Matsush.) Nirenberg and two belonged to clade 3 of the F. solani species complex. Of the 74 remaining isolates, the EF sequence showed 97% to 98% similarity to F. lactis. Of these isolates, the β-tubulin (TUB), calmodulin (CAM) and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) genes were also sequenced. Analysis of the combined sequences revealed that the 74 isolates share nine combined sequences that correspond to nine multilocus sequence types (STs), while the F. lactis neotype strain and one other strain, both isolated from figs, form a separate ST. Together, these 10 STs represent a monophyletic F. lactis species complex (FLASC). An unusually high level of genetic diversity was observed between (groups of) these STs. Two of them (ST5 and ST6) fulfilled the criteria for species recognition based on genealogical exclusivity and together represent a new monophyletic species lineage (FLASC-1). The seven other STs, together with the F. lactis neotype ST, form a paraphyletic species lineage in the African clade of the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (GFSC). From each of the 10 STs, the mycotoxin production was assessed using a multi-mycotoxin liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. Out of the 27 analyzed mycotoxins, beauvericin and fumonisins were detected in sweet pepper tissue and in maize kernels. The 10 STs clearly differed in the amount of mycotoxin produced, but there was only limited congruence between the production profile and the phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, the morphological characterization (based on mycelial growth rate and the length of macroconidia) showed distinct differences between the 10 STs, but again there was limited congruence with the phylogenetic results. In conclusion, the data presented in this study demonstrate that 75% of the isolates obtained from sweet pepper with internal fruit rot belong to a F. lactis species complex (FLASC), including a new FLASC-1 monophyletic species, and that the members of this complex display great genetic and phenotypic diversity.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D001530', 'D002147', 'D002170', 'D002212', 'D005670', 'D014644', 'D008969', 'D058885', 'D009183', 'D009426', 'D020648', 'D012319', 'D014404', 'D006113', 'D003313']","['Belgium', 'Calmodulin', 'Canada', 'Capsicum', 'Fusarium', 'Genetic Variation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multilocus Sequence Typing', 'Mycotoxins', 'Netherlands', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Tubulin', 'United Kingdom', 'Zea mays']",Genetic diversity and mycotoxin production of Fusarium lactis species complex isolates from sweet pepper.,"[None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235']","[None, 'genetics', None, 'microbiology', 'genetics', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22098923,2012

The carotenoid composition in a number of orange-coloured C. annuum cultivars was determined using HPLC and compared with transcript abundances for four carotenogenic enzymes, Psy, LcyB, CrtZ-2, and Ccs determined by qRT-PCR. There were unique carotenoid profiles as well as distinct patterns of transcription of carotenogenic enzymes within the seven orange-coloured cultivars. In one cultivar, 'Fogo', carrying the mutant ccs-3 allele, transcripts were detected for this gene, but no CCS protein accumulated. The premature stop termination in ccs-3 prevented expression of the biosynthetic activity to synthesize the capsanthin and capsorubin forms of carotenoids. In two other orange-coloured cultivars, 'Orange Grande' and 'Oriole', both with wild-type versions of all four carotenogenic enzymes, no transcripts for Ccs were detected and no red pigments accumulated. Finally, in a third case, the orange-coloured cultivar, Canary, transcripts for all four of the wild-type carotenogenic enzymes were readily detected yet no CCS protein appeared to accumulate and no red carotenoids were synthesized.

The presence of aflatoxins in hot pepper samples was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with a UV-Vis detector. Sampling for analysis of aflatoxins, total mold counts, and Aspergillus counts was carried out at 0, 50, 100, and 150 days of storage. Hot peppers packed in jute bags were more susceptible to aflatoxin contamination than those packed in polyethylene bags; aflatoxin concentrations were 75% higher in peppers stored in jute bags. The effect of storage temperature resulted in aflatoxin concentrations that were 61% higher in hot peppers stored at 25 and 30°C than in those stored at 20°C. Of the three pepper hybrids, Wonder King was more susceptible to aflatoxin contamination, with a maximum of 1.50 μg/kg when packed in jute bags and stored at 25°C for 150 days.

Volatiles were also measured before and after 1.5, 2.5, 3, 6, and 9 mo of frozen storage at -15 °C. The concentration of all lipoxygenase-derived compounds was significantly higher in unblanched jalapeño peppers compared to enzyme inhibited peppers. The maximum concentration of (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, and hexanal was detected at about 1.2, 1.5, and 1.5 min after tissue disruption, respectively. A decrease in (Z)-3-hexenal and an increase in dimethyl sulfide and methylbutanal occurred in blanched compared to stannous chloride-treated peppers due to heat. Frozen storage resulted in no major changes in the lipoxygenase-derived volatiles of whole and pureed blanched peppers after 9 mo. However, in whole unblanched peppers a gradual decrease of (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, hexanal, hexenol, and hexanol was observed over time; whereas in pureed unblanched peppers these compounds increased, reached maximum concentration, and then decreased. Similarly, the minor volatiles 2-pentenal, 1-penten-3-one, (E)-2-heptenal, (E)-2-octenal, and (E)-2-nonenal showed an initial increase followed by a decline in both whole and pureed unblanched peppers.

We include 2 California Wonder cultivars as C. annuum controls. A total of 16 carotenoids were identified and differences among species were mostly found at the quantitative level. Among red-fruited genotypes, capsanthin was the main carotenoid in the 3 species (25% to 50% contribution to carotenoid fraction), although ajíes contained the lowest contribution of this carotenoid. In addition, the contribution of capsanthin 5,6-epoxide to total carotenoids in this species was high (11% to 27%) in comparison to rocotos and red C. annuum. Antheraxanthin and violaxanthin were, in general, the next most relevant carotenoids in the red Andean peppers (6.1% to 10.6%). Violaxanthin was the major carotenoid in yellow-/orange-fruited genotypes of the 3 species (37% to 68% total carotenoids), although yellow rocotos were characterized by lower levels (<45%). Cis-violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and lutein were the next most relevant carotenoids in the yellow/orange Andean peppers (5% to 14%). As a whole, rocotos showed the highest contributions of provitamin A carotenoids to the carotenoid fraction. In terms of nutritional contribution, both ajíes and rocotos provide a remarkable provitamin A activity, with several accessions showing a content in retinol equivalents higher than California Wonder controls. Furthermore, levels of lutein in yellow/orange ajíes and rocotos were clearly higher than California Wonder pepper (≥1000 μg·100/g). Finally, the Andean peppers, particularly red ajíes, can be also considered as a noticeable source of capsanthin, the most powerful antioxidant compound among pepper carotenoids. Practical Application: Capsicum peppers are known for their content in carotenoids, although there is no information about 2 species with Andean origin: ajíes and rocotos.

Accessions represented four pepper species, Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, Capsicum chinense and Capsicum baccatum which were selected by their variation in morphological characters such as fruit color, pungency and origin. Major metabolites in fruits of pepper, carotenoids, capsaicinoids (pungency), flavonoid glycosides, and vitamins C and E were analyzed and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that composition and level of metabolites in fruits varied greatly between accessions and was independent of species and geographical location. Fruit color was determined by the accumulation of specific carotenoids leading to salmon, yellow, orange, red and brown colored fruits. Levels of both O- and C-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin and apigenin varied strongly between accessions. All non-pungent accessions were devoid of capsaicins, whereas capsaicinoid levels ranged from 0.07 up to 80 mg/100g fr. wt. in fruit pericarp. In general, pungent accessions accumulated the highest capsaicinoid levels in placenta plus seed tissue compared to pericarp. The non-pungent capsaicinoid analogs, capsiates, could be detected at low levels in some pungent accessions. All accessions accumulated high levels of vitamin C, up to 200 mg/100g fr. wt. The highest vitamin E concentration found was 16 mg/100g fr. wt.

The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) develop a procedure using headspace solid phase micro-extraction combined with GC-MS in the selected ion monitoring mode (HS-SPME-GC-MS-SIM) for analysis of MIBP in grape berries, and (2) determine the location of MIBP biosynthesis in grapevines by approach grafting clusters of Vitis vinifera L. cvs Cabernet Sauvignon and Muscat blanc onto each other. The soluble solids and pH of the grape juice/homogenate matrix from different grape berry developmental stages influenced the method precision; therefore, quantification via the method of standard addition was used. Using our developed method, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of MIBP were 0.1 ng L(-1) and 2 ng L(-1), respectively, measured in a model juice and non-MIBP containing Chardonnay juice. Spiked recoveries averaged between 91% and 112% in Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir homogenates and the overall relative standard deviation was less than 10%. The method was used to analyze MIBP in 29 grape cultivars and in fruit from clusters grafted to Cabernet Sauvignon or Muscat vines. Quantifiable levels were found only in Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc and Semillon, providing information on the genetic connection for the occurrence of MIBP in grapes. No MIBP was detected in the berries of Muscat blanc clusters grafted onto Cabernet Sauvignon vines when sampled at fruit maturity.

Two different commercial sweet pepper cultivars were inoculated with two different Fusarium proliferatum isolates that were sampled from diseased peppers. After 10 days of incubation at 20 °C in a closed container, the lesion caused by the fungal infection was dissected. Around the lesion, up to three concentric rings of pepper fruit tissue with a width of 5 mm were cut out and analyzed using a multimycotoxin LC-MS/MS method. The analyses resulted in the detection of beauvericin and fumonisins B(1), B(2), and B(3). Beauvericin was detected only in the lesions (95%), and the levels varied between 67 and 73800 μg/kg. Fumonisins B(1), B(2), and B(3) were detected in the lesions and in the surrounding tissue, indicating migration of these toxins into healthy parts of the sweet pepper. In the lesion the fumonisin B(1) level varied between 690 and 104000 μg/kg. Even in the outer ring fumonisin B(1) was still present. Mostly it was present at a lower level than in the lesion, with a maximum level of 556 μg/kg.

We hypothesized that IBMP is demethylated to 3-isobutyl-2-hydroxypyrazine (IBHP) during fruit maturation effectively reversing the final putative step of IBMP biosynthesis. A quantification method for IBHP was developed using solid-phase extraction coupled to one- or two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a recovery of ca. 80%. IBMP and IBHP in bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) and V. vinifera (cv. 'Cabernet Franc', 'Riesling', 'Pinot noir') were then measured at different maturities. IBMP and IBHP were inversely correlated in both bell peppers (R2=0.958) and Cabernet Franc grapes (R2=0.998) over a range of maturities. In bell peppers, we observed a significant decline in IBMP (125 to 15 ng/mL) and increase in IBHP (undetectable to 42 ng/mL) during ripening. In grapes, all cultivars had comparable IBHP concentrations preveraison (64 to 88 pg/mL) but differed in IBHP concentration by 2 orders of magnitude at the final sampling point (undetectable to 235 pg/mL). Higher preveraison IBMP was correlated with higher final IBHP across the three grape cultivars, with the order Cabernet Franc>Riesling>Pinot noir for both IBMP and IBHP.

More than 300 individual compounds could be detected in the studied genotypes; most of them could be identified by comparing mass spectra and retention times with authentic reference substances or literature data. Esters and terpenoids were the main groups, although other minor compounds, such as nitrogen and sulfur compounds, phenol derivatives, norcarotenoids, lipoxygenase derivatives, carbonyls, alcohols, and other hydrocarbons, were also identified. The sniffing test revealed that the diversity of aromas found among the studied cultivars is due to qualitative and quantitative differences of, at least, 23 odor-contributing volatiles (OCVs). C. chinense, and C. frutescens accessions, with fruity/exotic aromas, were characterized by a high contribution of several esters and ionones and a low or nil contribution of green/vegetable OCVs.

NVAs with a longer chain acyl moiety (LCNVAs) have been developed as attractive tools for medicinal usage because of their capsaicin-like bioactive and physiological properties, without harmful irritancy. In this study, we isolated four LCNVAs from Capsicum oleoresin. Their structures were determined to be N-vanillyl-hexadecanamide (palvanil, 2), N-vanillyl-octadecanamide (stevanil, 3), N-vanillyl-9E-octadecenamide (olvanil, 4), and N-vanillyl-9E,12E-octadecadienamide (livanil, 5) by spectroscopic analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of their methanolysis products. Furthermore, the existence of two LCNVAs in oleoresin, N-vanillyl-tetradecanamide (myrvanil, 1) and N-vanillyl-9E,12E,15E-octadecatrienamide (linvanil, 6), was suggested. The contents of these LCNVAs and the major capsaicinoids-capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin-in three Capsicum oleoresins and the fresh fruits of two hot peppers were measured by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system. The content ratios of the total LCNVAs, except for myrvanil, versus the capsaicin in the oleoresins (0.1-41%) was significantly larger than that in fresh fruits (<0.01%).

DART has been reported primarily for mass analyzers of low to moderate resolving power such as quadrupole ion traps and time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers. In the current work, a custom-built DART source has been successfully coupled to two different Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers for the first time. Comparison of spectra of the isobaric compounds, diisopropyl methylphosphonate and theophylline, acquired by 4.7 T FT-ICR MS and TOF MS, demonstrates that the TOF resolving power can be insufficient for compositionally complex samples. 9.4 T FT-ICR MS yielded the highest mass resolving power yet reported with DART ionization for 1,2-benzanthracene and 9,10-diphenylanthracene. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exhibit a spatial dependence in ionization mechanisms between the DART source and the mass spectrometer. The feasibility of analyzing a variety of samples was established with the introduction and analysis of food products and crude oil samples.

In addition, a micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) method was tested to analyze secondary metabolites produced by mold strains commonly found in paprika. This study was confirmed with a 5.8S-ITS region sequence analysis. A total of 31 isolates were identified by RFLP and MECC analysis. These showed stable RFLP profiles that were clearly different for the different genera and species, and were grouped into clusters together with the profiles of the 16 reference strains. MECC analysis provided additional characteristic peak patterns for the characterization of the mold species present. The characterized isolates were species of the genera Fusarium spp., Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., Cladosporium spp., Mucor spp. and Phlebia spp. The identifications were confirmed by the 5.8S-ITS region sequence analysis and by a BLAST search of the GenBank database.

Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) was used as a template molecule. A molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedure was developed for further application in the analysis of FB. The performance of the MIP throughout the clean-up of spiked bell pepper, rice and corn flake sample extracts was compared with the results obtained when using non-imprinted polymer, C(18), strong anion exchange and immunoaffinity sorbents. Extracts were analysed for FB with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after clean-up. Depending on the food matrix and the concentration range of the fumonisins, recoveries after MISPE varied from 62 to 86%, from 62 to 83%, and from 67 to 81% for fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)), fumonisin B(2) (FB(2)) and fumonisin B(3) (FB(3)), respectively. The selectivity of the synthesized MIP for mycotoxins belonging to the group of FB was confirmed by evaluating cross-reactivity from analogue structures and other mycotoxins. Analysis of 39 naturally contaminated samples (corn flakes) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry indicated that the synthesized MIP could be an excellent alternative for clean-up and pre-concentration of FB in food samples. Pearson correlations between immunoaffinity clean-up and MISPE were calculated and amounted to 0.923 for FB(1), 0.808 for FB(2), and 0.759 for FB(3).

This study involves separating capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin with sufficient purity and recovery using high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) with a solvent system composed of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water-acetic acid (20:20:20:20:2, v/v/v/v/v). Separation parameters such as sample volume, and sample concentration were first optimized on analytical HSCCC, and then scaled up to preparative HSCCC. 0.65 g capsaicin and 0.28 g dihydrocapsaicin were obtained from 1.2 g crude extract and their purities were 98.5 and 97.8%, respectively. The recoveries of the two compounds were 86.3 and 85.4%, respectively.

19489540,"Capsiconinoid is a group of nonpungent capsaicinoid analogues produced in Capsicum fruits, which we recently identified. Capsiconinoids have agonist activity for transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), which is reported to be a receptor for capsaicin. It is, therefore, important to screen cultivars containing high levels of capsiconinoid for their use as a vegetable or dietary supplement. This study describes the quantitative analysis of capsiconinoid content in fruits of 35 Capsicum cultivars: 18 cultivars of C. annuum, 7 of C. baccatum, 5 of C. chinense, 4 of C. frutescens, and 1 of C. pubescens. Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we found that 10 cultivars contained capsiconinoids. Capsiconinoid Baccatum (CCB) (C. baccatum var. praetermissum) showed the highest capsiconinoid content (3314 microg/g DW) and Charapita (C. chinense) had the second highest content. The other 8 cultivars had much lower capsiconinoid content than these two cultivars (<300 microg/g DW).

An earthy/bell pepper (EBP) flavor has been previously recognized in some of these cheeses. This study characterized the alkylmethoxypyrazine compounds causing EBP flavor in Farmstead Cheddar cheeses. Eight cheeses were divided into inner, outer, rind, and wrapper sections, and tested for descriptive sensory and instrumental analyses. To assess reproducibility of EBP flavor, cheeses from the same facilities were purchased and tested after 6 and 12 mo. EBP flavor was detected in four out of 8 Farmstead Cheddar cheeses by a trained sensory panel. 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine were identified as the main sources of EBP flavor in these cheeses by GC/O and GC/MS. In general, those alkylmethoxypyrazines were prevalent in the wrapper (106 to 730 ppb) and rind (39 to 444 ppb) sections of the cheeses. They were either not detected in inner and outer sections of the cheeses or were present at low concentrations. These results suggest that 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine are formed near the surface of the cheeses and migrate into the cheese during ripening. Threshold values in water and whole milk were 1 and 16 ppt for 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine, and 0.4 and 2.3 ppt for 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, respectively.

Despite the fruits' economic importance and decades of research, the regulation of the content of capsaicinoids in individual fruits is not completely elucidated, and no agricultural cultivation of chili of defined pungency is assured. Precursor candidates of the fatty acid moiety of the capsaicinoids, especially for the unique 8-methyl- trans-6-nonenoic acid, were examined. Thioesters, acyl-ACP and acyl-CoA, were isolated from the placenta of Capsicum fruits by means of DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, selectively converted to the corresponding N-butylamides, and analyzed by GC-MS. Fatty acid moieties characteristic for capsaicinoids were identified. In two different varieties ( Capsicum chinense var. Habanero orange and Capsicum annuum var. Jalapeno) it was shown that the fatty acid pattern corresponds to the distribution pattern of the capsaicinoids formed up to this time.

High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis of violet and black fruit tissue identified a single anthocyanin that was determined to be delphinidin-3-p-coumaroyl-rutinoside-5-glucoside. Leaf tissue of a black-pigmented foliage genotype contained the same anthocyanin found in fruit but at a considerably higher concentration in comparison to violet and black fruit tissue. Fruit chlorophyll concentration was approximately 14-fold higher in black fruit in comparison to violet fruit that contained relatively little chlorophyll. Beta-carotene, lutein, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin carotenoid concentrations in black fruit were also significantly greater in comparison to violet fruit. High concentrations of delphinidin in combination with chlorophyll and accessory carotenoid pigments produced the characteristic black pigmentation observed in fruits and leaves of selected genotypes. Anthocyanins were accumulated in the outer mesocarp of violet and black fruit and in the palisade and mesophyll cells of black leaves. Consistent with chlorophyll content of respective genotypes, chloroplast density was greater in cells of black fruits.

Stringent quality-based selection and the combination of different de novo sequencing methods substantially increase the catalog of significant peptide alignments. The de novo sequences passing a reliability filter are subsequently submitted to error tolerant BLAST searches and MS-BLAST hits are validated by a sampling technique.

Several classes of compounds belonging to different chemical families (triazines, organophosphorous, carbamates, phenylureas, neonicotinoids, etc.) were carefully chosen to cover a wide range of applications in the environmental field. Excellent chromatographic separation was achieved by the use of narrow accurate mass windows (0.05 Da) in a 30 min interval. Accurate mass measurements were always below 2 ppm error for all the pesticides studied. A table compiling the accurate masses for 101 compounds together with the accurate mass of several fragment ions is included. At least the accurate mass for one main fragment ion for each pesticide was obtained to achieve the minimum of identification points according to the 2002/657/EC European Decision, thus fulfilling the EU point system requirement for identification of contaminants in samples. The method was validated with vegetable samples. Calibration curves were linear and covered two orders of magnitude (from 5 to 500 microg/L) for most of the compounds studied. Instrument detection limits (LODs) ranged from 0.04 to 150 microg/kg in green-pepper samples.

17728301,"Ripe pepper (Capsicum sp.) fruits can display a range of colours from white to deep red. To understand better the regulatory mechanisms of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathways that underlie these ripening colours, Capsicum varieties that show seven different fully ripe colour types were analysed. The levels and composition of the carotenoid accumulation in these samples at different stages of ripening were measured, and the resulting data were analysed in conjunction with the expression patterns of the carotenoid biosynthetic genes. It was found that red peppers accumulate increasing levels of total carotenoids during ripening, whereas non-red peppers accumulate lower levels of total carotenoids of varying composition. The expression levels of the phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, and capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (Ccs) genes are high in peppers with high levels of total carotenoid, whereas one or two of these genes are not expressed in peppers with lower levels of total carotenoid. Surprisingly, it was found that the Ccs gene is present in two Capsicum varieties whose ripe colour is yellow. This gene has never previously been shown to be present in yellow peppers. Sequence analyses of the Ccs gene further revealed two structural mutations in yellow peppers that may result in either a premature stop-codon or a frame-shift.

17661486,"The quantitative inheritance of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin contents in fruits has been studied in an intraspecific cross of Capsicum annuum L. across two different environments, namely, fruits developed in spring and summer. A liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry [HPLC-ESI/MS(TOF)] method was used to identify and quantify capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin in extracts of pepper fruits. The analytical method used was able to determine the pungency of genotypes that, using other methods, would have been classified as non-pungent. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin contents varied largely among families, and families did not respond similarly in producing these capsaicinoids when their fruits were grown in spring and summer, with some families showing no increase, whereas in others, the increase was more than 2-fold. Heterosis for the pungency trait, assessed by the capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin contents in fruits, was found, indicating the existence of epistasis, over-dominance, or dominance complementation. Non-pungent parent alleles contributed to the capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin contents since transgressive segregation did occur. Furthermore, the type of gene action varied between capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, and a seasonal effect during fruit development could affect gene action.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002211', 'D002212', 'D002851', 'D003433', 'D004777', 'D005638', 'D005838', 'D006801', 'D021241', 'D013649']","['Capsaicin', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Environment', 'Fruit', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Taste']","Inheritance of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, determined by HPLC-ESI/MS, in an intraspecific cross of Capsicum annuum L.","['Q000031', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None]","['analogs & derivatives', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17661486,2007
17623368,"A simple and rapid microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) procedure combined with 1H-NMR spectrometry was developed and optimised for the extraction and quantitative determination of capsaicin in Capsicum frutescens. The influence of experimental variables, including irradiation power, extraction temperature and dynamic extraction time before reaching the selected extraction temperature, on the performance of the extraction procedure was systematically studied using a Box-Behnken experimental design followed by a conventional central composite design approach. Statistical treatment of the results together with results from some additional experiments suggested optimum extraction conditions as 120 degrees C and 150 W, for 15 min with acetone as extractant. The optimised MAE method provides extracts that can be analysed quantitatively using 1H-NMR without any preliminary clean-up or derivatisation steps. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of the crude extracts the doublet signal in the delta range 4.349-4.360 ppm was well separated from other resonances in deuterated chloroform. The quantity of the compound was calculated from the relative ratio of the integral value of the target peak to that of a known amount of dimethylformamide as internal standard. In comparison with traditional Soxhlet extraction, the proposed method is less labour-intensive and provides a drastic reduction of extraction time and solvent consumption.

17562464,"With the public perception that synthetic pesticides leave harmful residues in crop produce for human consumption, there has been increased interest in using natural products for pest control. The potential of using fruit extracts of hot pepper for controlling the cabbage looper, Trichopulsia ni (Hübner) and spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch is explored in this investigation. Crude extracts from fruits of Capsicum chinense, C. frutescens, C. baccatum, and C. annuum, were prepared and tested under laboratory conditions for their insecticidal and acaricidal performance. Mortality was greatest (94%) when fruit extract of accession PI-593566 (C. annuum) was sprayed on larvae of the cabbage looper, while crude extracts of accessions PI-241675 (C. frutescens) and PI-310488 (C. annuum) were repellent to the spider mite. We investigated differences in chemical composition of the crude fruit extracts that may explain the observed differences in mortality and repellency between accessions. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry spectrometric analysis revealed that capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, the pungent components of pepper fruit, were not correlated with toxicity or repellency, indicating that the two capsaicinoids are not likely related to the efficacy of pepper fruit extracts. Major compounds in hot pepper fruit extracts were detected and identified as pentadecanoic acid methyl ester, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, and octadecanoic acid methyl ester. Spectrometric analysis and toxicity to cabbage looper larvae revealed that pentadecanoic acid methyl ester is likely related to cabbage looper mortality. However, the concentration of pentadecanoic acid methyl ester in some accessions was insufficient to explain the observed mortality of cabbage looper and repellency of spider mite. Fruit extracts of accessions PI-593566 (C. annuum) and PI-241675 (C. frutescens) could be useful for managing populations of cabbage loopers and spider mites, which could reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides. Further study is needed to investigate performance of hot pepper extracts under ultra-violet light and field conditions.","Journal of environmental science and health. Part.

The combination of a novel strategy for database-independent detection of proteins from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data with standard database searches allowed us to identify 151 proteins with a high level of confidence. These include several well-known plastid proteins but also novel proteins that were not previously reported from other plastid proteome studies. The majority of the identified proteins are active in plastid carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.

17090122,"Stay-green mutants have been very useful for elucidating the chlorophyll catabolism pathway in higher plants. In the present study the possible relationship between the retention/catabolism of chlorophylls and the carotenogenic process taking place in ripening Capsicum annuum (L.) fruits has been investigated. Phytylated, dephytylated and oxidized chlorophyll derivatives, and total and individual carotenoids were analyzed over the whole ripening period. In general terms, the biosynthesis of carotenoid pigments taking place during the ripening of C. annuum fruits is identical in both red and stay-green lines, so that the carotenogenic process is independent of the retention of chlorophylls. However, it has been found that the carotenogenesis is slowed in the stay-green lines. Therefore, although the catabolism of chlorophylls and biosynthesis of carotenoids seem to be separate processes, the fact that they are taking place in the chloroplast/chromoplast suggests that some kind of interaction between the two processes may occur at different levels. Plastids corresponding to the wild genotype (red color fruit phenotype) show high plastoglobuli density and thylakoids are almost absent, whereas in the case of stay-green phenotype, thylakoids and plastoglobuli coexist in the same plastid (chlorochromoplasts).

17041029,"The U-box motif is a conserved domain found in the diverse isoforms of E3 ubiquitin ligase in eukaryotes. From water-stressed hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv Pukang) plants, we isolated C. annuum putative U-box protein 1 (CaPUB1), which encodes a protein containing a single U-box motif in its N-terminal region. In vitro ubiquitination and site-directed mutagenesis assays revealed that CaPUB1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and that the U-box motif was indeed essential for its enzyme activity. RNA gel-blot analysis showed that CaPUB1 mRNA was induced rapidly by a broad spectrum of abiotic stresses, including drought, high salinity, cold temperature, and mechanical wounding, but not in response to ethylene, abscisic acid, or a bacterial pathogen, suggesting its role in the early events in the abiotic-related defense response. Because transgenic work was extremely difficult in hot pepper, in this study we overexpressed CaPUB1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to provide cellular information on the function of this gene in the development and plant responses to abiotic stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively expressed the CaPUB1 gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter had markedly longer hypocotyls and roots and grew more rapidly than the wild type, leading to an early bolting phenotype. Microscopic analysis showed that 35S::CaPUB1 roots had increased numbers of small-sized cells, resulting in disordered, highly populated cell layers in the cortex, endodermis, and stele. In addition, CaPUB1-overexpressing plants displayed increased sensitivity to water stress and mild salinity. These results indicate that CaPUB1 is functional in Arabidopsis cells, thereby effectively altering cell and tissue growth and also the response to abiotic stresses. Comparative proteomic analysis showed that the level of RPN6 protein, a non-ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome complex, was significantly reduced in 35SCaPUB1 seedlings as compared to the wild type. Pull-down and ubiquitination assays demonstrated that RPN6 interacted physically with CaPUB1 and was ubiquitinated in a CaPUB1-dependent manner in vitro. Although the physiological function of CaPUB1 is not yet clear, there are several possibilities for its involvement in a subset of physiological responses to counteract dehydration and high-salinity stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings.",Plant physiology,"['D020816', 'D000595', 'D017360', 'D002212', 'D049109', 'D018076', 'D015180', 'D010450', 'D004926', 'D008969', 'D010641', 'D010940', 'D030821', 'D040901', 'D012441', 'D029701', 'D016415', 'D019032', 'D044767']","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Capsicum', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Endopeptidases', 'Escherichia coli', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Proteomics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",Heterologous expression and molecular and cellular characterization of CaPUB1 encoding a hot pepper U-Box E3 ubiquitin ligase homolog.,"[None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'genetics', 'enzymology', None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', 'genetics', None, None, 'chemistry', 'cytology', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17041029,2007
17031752,"The influence of soil contamination by inorganic and organic arsenic compounds on uptake, accumulation, and transformation of arsenic in pepper (Capsicum annum L.) was investigated in greenhouse pot experiments under controlled conditions. Pepper plants were cultivated in substrate amended by aqueous solutions of arsenite, arsenate, methylarsonic acid (MA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) applied individually into cultivation substrate at concentrations of 15 mg As per kg of substrate. The plant availability of the arsenicals increased in the order arsenite = arsenate < MA < DMA. The highest arsenic concentrations were found in roots followed by stems, leaves, and fruits regardless of arsenic compound applied. In the control samples of pepper fruits, As(III), As(V), and DMA were present (25%, 37%, and 39% of the water-extractable arsenic). In control stems + leaves and roots, As(V) was the major compound (63% and 53% in a phosphate buffer extract) followed by As(III) representing 33% and 42%. Additionally, low concentrations (not exceeding 5%) of DMA and MA were detected as well. In all the soils analyzed after the first harvest of pepper fruits, arsenate was the dominating compound followed by arsenite. Methylarsonic acid, methylarsonous acid, and DMA were present at varying concentrations depending on the individual soil treatments. In the treated plants, the arsenic compounds in plant tissues reflected predominantly the extractable portions of arsenic compounds present in soil after amendment, and this pattern was more significant in the first part of vegetation period. The results confirmed the ability of generative parts of plants to accumulate preferably organic arsenic compounds, whereas in the roots and aboveground biomass, mainly inorganic arsenic species are present.

According to HPLC-DAD-MS3 analyses the major anthocyanin in eggplant was delphinidin-3-rutinoside, while the predominant pigment in violet pepper was assigned to delphinidin-3-trans-coumaroylrutinoside-5-glucoside. Since virtually all anthocyanins were delphinidin-based, the effect of acylation and glycosylation patterns on colour stability and antioxidant capacity could be assessed. Application of two in vitro-assays for antioxidant capacity assessment revealed that eggplant generally exhibited higher values compared to violet pepper which was ascribed to 3,5-diglycosylated structures predominating in the latter. The higher extent of acylation in violet pepper was reflected by a more purplish colour shade of the extracts, but did not translate into a higher stability against fading which again was attributed to additional glycosyl substitution at C5. These findings support the relevance of structure-related activities of anthocyanins both for understanding food colour and their particular nutritional value.","Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

To further improve the usefulness of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), studies were carried out on the analysis of extracts containing up to eight of the following capsaicinoids: capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin-I, homocapsaicin-II, homodihydrocapsaicin-I, homodihydrocapsaicin-II, nonivamide, and nordihydrocapsaicin. HPLC was optimized by defining effects on retention times of (a) the composition of the mobile phase (acetonitrile/0.5% formic acid in H2O), (b) the length of the Inertsil column, and (c) the capacity values (k) of the column packing. Identification was based on retention times and mass spectra of individual peaks. Quantification was based on the UV response at 280 nm in HPLC and recoveries from spiked samples. The method (limit of detection of approximately 15-30 ng) was successfully used to quantify capsaicinoid levels of parts of the pepper fruit (pericarp, placenta, seeds, and in the top, middle, and base parts of whole peppers) in 17 species of peppers and in 23 pepper-containing foods.

16245725,"A strategy for rapid in situ elimination of interfering substances that are present in extracts of food samples during assay is described in this article. The novel feature of this method is that the sample purification is carried out as a part of the assay, and a separate sample cleanup step is not required. The assay procedure involves the sequential addition of standard or sample, cleaning solutions, and aflatoxin B1-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (AFB1-HRP) over antibody-spotted zones of a membrane, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate for visualization. We have determined that trifluoroacetic acid and propionic acids at concentrations of 100 mM are highly effective for cleaning groundnut, wheat, corn, and poultry feed samples and that NaHCO3 (100 mM) is successful in cleaning processed soybean. In all cases, subsequent washing was performed with phosphate-buffered saline solution to facilitate the removal of traces of adhering interfering substances. A batch of 12 samples can be analyzed within 8 min either by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards or, more precisely, by densitometry. The method was tested for the analysis of AFB1 in groundnut, wheat, corn, processed soybean, chili, and poultry feed. The detection limit obtained was 5 microg/kg, except for chili, where it was 10 microg/kg. The average recoveries from different noninfected food samples spiked with AFB1 at concentrations of 5 to 100 microg/kg were between 99 and 105%. The values obtained for infected corn and groundnut samples correlated well with the estimates obtained by high-pressure liquid chromatography.

Xyloglucans, solubilized from plant cell walls by a sequential (enzymatic and chemical) extraction procedure, were isolated, and their structures were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. All campanulids examined, including Lactuca sativa (lettuce, order Asterales), Tenacetum ptarmiciflorum (dusty miller, order Asterales), and Daucus carota (carrot, order Apiales), produce typical xyloglucans that have an XXXG-type branching pattern and contain alpha-d-Xylp-, beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Xylp-, and alpha-L-Fucp-(1-->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Xylp- side chains. However, the lamiids produce atypical xyloglucans. For example, previous analyses showed that Capsicum annum (pepper) and Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato), two species in the order Solanales, and Olea europaea (olive, order Lamiales) produce xyloglucans that contain arabinosyl and galactosyl residues, but lack fucosyl residues. The XXGG-type xyloglucans produced by Solanaceous species are less branched than the XXXG-type xyloglucan produced by Olea europaea. This study shows that Ipomoea pupurea (morning glory, order Solanales), Ocimum basilicum (basil, order Lamiales), and Plantago major (plantain, order Lamiales) all produce xyloglucans that lack fucosyl residues and have an unusual XXGGG-type branching pattern in which the basic repeating core contains five glucose subunits in the backbone. Furthermore, Neruim oleander (order Gentianales) produces an XXXG-type xyloglucan that contains arabinosyl, galactosyl, and fucosyl residues.

Seedlings of sweet pepper, Capsicum annuum L. cv. Bell Boy Hybrid and tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Mountain Spring F1 Hybrid were planted and sprayed with a Multi-Purpose Insecticide formulation that contains 0.2% pyrethrins, 1.0% piperonyl butoxide (PBO), 88% diatomaceous earth, and 10.8% inert ingredients. The formulation was sprayed on pepper and tomato foliage when tomato fruits became red ripe and pepper became mature green at the rate of 6 lbs of formulated product per acre (5.4 and 27.2 g AI of pyrethrins and PBO, respectively). Following spraying, pepper and tomato leaves and fruits were collected at different time intervals for residue analysis using a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a UV detector.

The transgenic rice plants require foliar application of amines to support synthesis of hydroxycinnamic acid amides, suggestive of limiting amine substrates in rice shoots. In addition, when T2 homozygous transgenic rice plants were grown in the presence of amines or phenolic acids, two novel compounds were exclusively identified in the leaves of the transgenic plants. These compounds eluted earlier than p-coumaroyltyramine and feruloyltyramine during HPLC chromatography and were identified as p-coumaroylserotonin and feruloylserotonin by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and other methods. To test whether the unpredicted production of serotonin derivatives is associated with the pepper N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase, the substrate specificity of the pepper enzyme was analyzed again. Purified recombinant pepper N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase exhibited a serotonin N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (SHT) activity, synthesized p-coumaroylserotonin and feruloylserotonin in vitro, and demonstrated a low K(m) for serotonin. SHT activity was inhibited by 10 to 50 mm tyramine. In addition, SHT activity was predominantly found in the root tissues of wild-type rice in parallel with the synthesis of serotonin derivatives, suggesting that serotonin derivatives are synthesized in the root of rice.

The nitrate () and nitrite () contents of various vegetables (Chinese cabbage, radish, lettuce, spinach, soybean sprouts, onion, pumpkin, green onion, cucumber, potato, carrot, garlic, green pepper, cabbage and Allium tuberosum Roth known as Crown daisy) are reported. Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables. The average nitrite contents in various vegetables were about 0.6 mg kg(-1), and the values were not significantly different among most vegetables. It was observed that nitrate contents in vegetables varied depending on the type of vegetables and were similar to those in vegetables grown in other countries.

Chilli powders were collected from different supermarkets in Hyderabad, AP. They were analysed for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) content by an indirect competitive ELISA. To avoid the influence of interfering substances present in chilli extracts, it was necessary to prepare the aflatoxin standards in methanol extracts of chillies free from aflatoxins. For nine representative samples there was good agreement between ELISA and HPLC estimations of AFB1 and the results suggested that the ELISA procedure adopted was dependable. Of the 182 chilli samples tested, 59% of the samples were contaminated with AFB1 and 18% contained the toxin at non-permissible levels. The highest AFB1 concentration of 969 microg/kg was found in one sample representing grade 3. Overall the maximum percentage of chilli pods showing AFB1 levels higher than 30 microg/kg (non-permissible levels) was in grade 3.

N-terminal sequences obtained indicated that the pepper leaf proteinase inhibitors (PLPIs) exhibit homology to two GenBank accessions that code for preproteins containing three isoinhibitors domains each that, when post-translationally processed, can account for the mixture of isoinhibitors that are reported herein from pepper leaves. A constitutive level of PLPI proteins was found in pepper leaves, and these levels increased up to 2.6-fold upon wounding of the lower leaves. Exposing intact plants to methyl jasmonate vapors induced the accumulation of PLPIs. Supplying excised young pepper plants with water through the cut stems induced PLPI proteins to levels higher than those found in intact plants, but with high variability. Supplying the excised plants with systemin did not result in an increase of PLPI levels that were statistically higher than levels found in excised plants. Gel-blot analyses of PLPI induction revealed the presence of two mRNA bands, having slightly different mobilities in agarose gels. Only the low M(r) mRNA is present in untreated control plants, and it appears to be responsible for the constitutive levels of PLPI found in leaves.

10888567,"Spice paprika (red pepper; Capsicum annuum) is the most cultivated spice worldwide and is used mainly for its color and pungency. However, current research is also focusing on the flavor as an important parameter. This paper deals with the kinetics of the formation of those volatiles that indicate a decrease in spice paprika quality due to Maillard reaction, hydrolytic reactions, and oxidative degradation reactions of lipids such as fatty acids and carotenoids. Spice paprika volatiles were quantitatively analyzed by means of headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The kinetics of their formation were investigated, and the respective activation energies determined. Strecker aldehyde, acetone, and methanol formation followed a pseudo-zero-order reaction kinetic, and formation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) was characterized by a first-order kinetic. The activation energies determined were between 86.3 and 101.8 for the Strecker aldehydes acetaldehyde (AA), 2-methylpropanal (2-MP), 3-methylbutanal (3-MB), and 2-methylbutanal (2-MB), 130.7 for acetone, 114.2 for methanol, and 109.7 kJ/mol for DMS. The amounts of Strecker aldehydes formed were correlated to the concentrations of the corresponding free amino acids present in the samples. The formation of hexanal and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one in Capsicum annuum during processing was confirmed, and the formation of beta-ionone was probably described for the first time.

10772170,"A collaborative study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of an immunoaffinity column cleanup liquid chromatography (LC) method for the determination of aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxins at European regulatory limits. The test portion is extracted with methanol-water (8 + 2) for dried figs and paprika, and with methanol-water (8 + 2) plus hexane (or cyclohexane) for peanut butter and pistachios. The sample extract is filtered, diluted with phosphate buffer saline, and applied to an immunoaffinity column. The column is washed with water and the aflatoxins are eluted with methanol. Aflatoxins are quantitated by reversed-phase LC with post-column derivatization (PCD) involving bromination. PCD is achieved with either an electrochemical cell (Kobra cell) and addition of bromide to the mobile phase or pyridinium hydrobromide perbromide. Determination is by fluorescence. Peanut butter, pistachio paste, dried fig paste, and paprika powder samples, both naturally contaminated with aflatoxins and containing added aflatoxins, were sent to 16 collaborators in 16 European countries.

10563856,"A study was conducted to investigate the change in quality attributes of red pepper (paprika) (Capsicum annuum L. var. Km-622) as a function of ripening and some technological factors. Of quality attributes, carotenoids and bioantioxidants (ascorbic acid and tocopherols) have been studied. It was found that the dynamics of fruit ripening with regard to carotenoids and bioantioxidants was influenced to a considerable extent by weather conditions of the production season. A rainy and cool season yielded fruits with more beta-carotene but less diesters of red xanthophylls as compared to those produced in a relatively dry and warm season. The ripening stage at harvest was found to affect the quality of paprika. Harvest at unripe stages (color break or faint red) resulted in a high accumulation of dehydroascorbic acid in the overripe fruits, whereas de novo biosynthesis of carotenoids and tocopherols was partially retarded. Application of pre-drying centrifugation resulted in a marked loss of ascorbic acid, and as a consequence, carotenoid stability was impaired during the storage of ground paprika. Sugar caramelization caused dry pods and ground paprika to retain more pigments and tocopherol as compared to those from control or centrifuged red pepper samples. During the storage of ground paprika, color stability was improved by grinding the seeds with the pericarp.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000975', 'D002212', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D010946']","['Antioxidants', 'Capsicum', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Plants, Medicinal']",Change in the carotenoid and antioxidant content of spice red pepper (paprika) as a function of ripening and some technological factors.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10563856,2000
9804838,"The differentiation of chloroplasts into chromoplasts involves a series of biochemical changes that culminate with the intense accumulation of long chain chromophore carotenoids such as lycopene, rhodoxanthin, astaxanthin, anhydroeschsoltzxanthin, capsanthin, and capsorubin. The signal pathways mediating these transformations are unknown. Chromoplast carotenoids are known to accumulate in green tissues experiencing stress conditions, and studies indicate that they provide efficient protection against oxidative stress. We tested the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as regulators of chromoplast carotenoid biosynthesis in vivo. The addition of ROS progenitors, such as menadione, tert-butylhydroperoxide, or paraquat and prooxidants such as diamide or buthionine sulfoximine to green pericarp discs of pepper fruits rapidly and dramatically induce the simultaneous expression of multiple carotenogenic gene mRNAS that give rise to capsanthin. Similarly, down-regulation of catalase by amitrole induces expression of carotenogenic gene mRNAs leading to the synthesis of capsanthin in excised green pericarp discs. ROS signals from plastids and mitochondria also contribute significantly to this process. Analysis of the capsanthin-capsorubin synthase promoter in combination with a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene reveals strong activation in transformed pepper protoplasts challenged with the above ROS.

9237940,"The pharmacokinetics of dietary capsanthin was measured in four male volunteers to assess the bioavailability of oxygenated carotenoids (xanthophylls). Capsanthin was used because this carotenoid was not detected in the men's plasma before ingestion of paprika juice. Supplementing capsanthin-rich paprika juice for 1 wk (equivalent to three doses of 5.4 micromol capsanthin/d; 16.2 micromol/d), the level of capsanthin reached a plateau (0.10-0.12 micromol/L) between d 2 and 7 and was not detectable by d 16. Capsanthin was distributed in the plasma lipoproteins (VLDL, 13 +/- 3%; LDL , 44 +/- 3%; HDL, 43 +/- 3%) at the end of the experiment. In a separate experiment involving the single ingestion of paprika juice (equivalent to 34.2 micromol capsanthin) in the same men, the plasma concentration of capsanthin ranged from 0.10 to 0.29 micromol/L at 8 h after ingestion. In contrast, the elevation of the plasma concentration of an acyclic hydrocarbon carotenoid, lycopene, by a single ingestion of tomato soup (equivalent to 186.3 micromol lycopene) in the same subjects was minimal (0.02-0.06 micromol/L). The areas under the curves (AUC) for capsanthin between 0 and 74 h and for lycopene between 0 and 72 h were 4.68 +/- 1.22 and 0.81 +/- 0.17(micromol.h)/L, respectively. The half-lives (t1/2) were calculated to be 20.1 +/- 1.3 and 222 +/- 15 h for capsanthin and lycopene, respectively.

The deduced peptide sequence revealed high similarity between the C. annuum cysteine synthase and its bacterial counterparts. In vitro transcription and translation of the cDNA and subsequent import experiments demonstrated that the encoded cysteine synthase is located in the plastids. The steady-state level of the cysteine synthase mRNA is almost constant in dark-grown hypocotyls, leaves, and fruits. However, a slight increase in this mRNA level was detected during fruit development (when the 25 S rRNA was taken as an internal standard). Similarly, the cysteine synthase activity in plastids was found to increase during fruit development and reaches the highest levels in the chromoplasts of red fruits. To address the physiological role of this phenomenon, we have shown that cysteine is engaged in the active metabolism of glutathione.

The characteristic carotenoids of the bright red paprika and cayenne-type chillies, the high character impact aroma stimuli, the methoxy pyrazine of green bell capsicum, the esters of ripe tabasco and the highly potent pungency stimuli, and the capsaicinoids of African and other Asian varieties of chillies, have been of great interest to chemists and biochemists. Research workers in other disciplines such as genetics and breeding, agriculture, and technology have been interested in this spice to develop new varieties with combinations of different optimal levels of the stimuli for the sensory attributes and to maximize production of storable products for specific end uses. Physiologists have been intensely studying the action of the highly potent pungency stimuli and social psychologists the curious aspect of growing acceptance and preference for the initially unacceptable pungency sensation. In the sequential review of all these aspects of the fruit spice Capsicum, the earlier two parts covered history, botany, cultivation and primary processing, and processed products, standards, world production, and trade. In Part III, the chemistry, the compositional variations, synthesis and biosynthesis of the functional components, the carotenoids, the volatiles, and the capsaicinoids are comprehensively reviewed.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,"['D002211', 'D002212', 'D002338', 'D055598', 'D002621', 'D002845', 'D005519', 'D005524', 'D006358', 'D007659', 'D008027', 'D008968', 'D009812', 'D010858', 'D010945', 'D010946', 'D011719', 'D012903', 'D013649', 'D014835', 'D024341']","['Capsaicin', 'Capsicum', 'Carotenoids', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography', 'Food Preservation', 'Food Technology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Ketones', 'Light', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Odorants', 'Pigmentation', 'Plants, Edible', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Pyrazines', 'Smell', 'Taste', 'Volatilization', 'Xanthophylls']","Capsicum--production, technology, chemistry, and quality.

7299076,Four sprays of 0.05 and 0.10% phosalone were given on chilli (Capsicum annuum Linn.) crop at an interval of 15 days starting from 21 days after transplanting. Residues were determined in the green chilli fruits by GLC after cleanup of extract on multiband thin-layer plate. The half-lives of residues were 1.55 and 1.68 days on chilli fruits from the crop treated with four sprays of 0.05 and 0.10% phosalone respectively. The time required to reach the tolerance limit of 1 ppm after last spray with 0.05 and 0.10% emulsion was 4.75 and 7.62 days respectively.

The pattern of dissipation of endosulfan was conventional showing half-life less than two days. The waiting periods worked out were 5 and 7 days after protecting the crop with four sprays of 0.03 and 0.08% endosulfan respectively. The dissipation of alpha isomer was found faster than that of beta isomer.

1249019,"A simple and accurate method has been developed for the quantitative determination of capsaicin in capsicum spices and their oleosresins. Capsaicin is extracted with acetone and separated from interfering substances, using an activated alumina column. The column is first eluted with acetone, and then the capsaicin is eluted with acetone-methanol-water (75+25+2). The capsaicin is quantitated by gas-liquid chromatography, using a Carbowax 20M-Teflon column and piperine as an internal standard. Results can be calculated as per cent capsaicin or Scoville units. Recovery of added capsaicin averaged 101%.",Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,"['D002211', 'D002212', 'D002849', 'D003212', 'D005231', 'D008722', 'D010946']","['Capsaicin', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Condiments', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Methods', 'Plants, Medicinal']",Gas-liquid chromatographic determination of capsaicin.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1249019,1976
