35347716,"Fermentation of eight vegetables was studied as an alternative for reclamation of surplus volumes. Fermentation performance was predicted by comparing the amounts of acid that could be produced from the intrinsic sugar content with that buffered by the fresh vegetable matrices prior to reaching an inhibitory pH for fermentative microbes (3.30). Native fermentations were brined with 345.0 mM sodium chloride, 40.0 mM calcium chloride, 6.0 mM potassium sorbate, and vinegar to adjust the initial pH to 4.70. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis, pH, and carbon dioxide measurements and spiral plating on selective media were employed to monitor the progress of fermentations. The average colony counts for yeast and/or molds and Enterobacteriaceae declined to undetectable levels from 3.6 ± 1.5 log CFU/ml within 7 days of fermentation. The fermentation of sugars produced lactic, acetic, succinic, and/or malic acids, and ethanol. As predicted, the fermentation of vegetables with low sugar content, such as broccoli, green leaf lettuce, and green pea proceeded to completion. The fermentation of vegetables with a moderate sugar content, such as green bell pepper, red ripened tomato, and green bean were incomplete at pH 3.1 ± 0.2. The fermentation of high sugar vegetables including sweet potato and corn were expected and observed to be incomplete. It is concluded that the intrinsic sugar content and buffer capacity of surplus vegetables are relevant parameters in obtaining complete fermentations. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Vegetables are the second most wasted commodity in the United States and a substantial constituent of the global food waste. Development of fermentation to reclaim surplus vegetables from farms, grocery stores, and farmer's markets offers opportunities to ameliorate economic losses and environmental impact and add value to waste. The research described here suggests that a fraction of vegetables could be fermented in cover brines while others, with high sugar content, need specialized handling. Evidently, optimization of vegetable fermentation with starter cultures and added buffers represent an opportunity to stimulate complete bioconversions useful for reclaiming surplus volumes.",Journal of food science,"['D018553', 'D005285', 'D005516', 'D006863', 'D012037', 'D012965', 'D017673', 'D000073893', 'D014675']","['Cucumis sativus', 'Fermentation', 'Food Microbiology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Refuse Disposal', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Sodium Chloride, Dietary', 'Sugars', 'Vegetables']",Vegetable fermentations brined with low salt for reclaiming food waste.,"['Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","['chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35347716,2022
34735138,"Dietary biomarkers show great promise for objectively assessing the food intake in humans. In this study, potential urinary biomarkers for red bell pepper intake were identified based on a dietary intervention study and a comprehensive metabolomics approach. Spot urine samples from 14 volunteers were collected in the two phases of the study (control phase: abstaining from any bell pepper/paprika products; case phase: consumption of a defined amount of fresh red bell pepper and abstaining from any further bell pepper/paprika products) and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS). Comparison of the obtained metabolomics data using statistical analysis revealed that the respective urine metabolomes differ significantly, which was attributable to the bell pepper intake. Some of the most discriminating metabolites were selected and isolated from human urine for unequivocal structure elucidation by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

34684758,"Dried and ground red pepper is a spice used as seasoning in various traditional dishes all over the world; nevertheless, the pedoclimatic conditions of the diverse cultivation areas provide different chemical characteristics, and, consequently, diverse organoleptic properties to this product. In the present study, the volatile profiles of 96 samples of two different ground bell peppers harvested in diverse Italian geographical areas, Altino (Abruzzo) and Senise (Lucania), and a commercial sweet paprika, have been studied by means of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The investigation of their volatile profile has led to the identification of 59 analytes. Eventually, a discriminant classifier, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), was exploited to discriminate samples according to their geographical origin. The model provided very accurate results in external validation; in fact, it correctly classified all the 30 test samples, achieving 100% correct classification (on the validation set). Furthermore, in order to understand which volatiles contribute the most at differentiating the bell peppers from the different origins, a variable selection approach, Variable Importance in Projection (VIP), was used.

As a thermal process, blanching in water and in steam was studied, while for non-thermal the sonication, pulsed electric field treatment and their combination were used in this experiment. The red bell peppers were evaluated based on quality attributes such as: total carotenoids content; polyphenols; vitamin C; antioxidant activity and sugars content. Vitamin C and sugar content were analyzed using liquid chromatography and other measurements were determined based on the spectrophotometric method. Results showed that the blanching in water or in steam reduced bioactive compounds concentration; whereas non-thermal treatments as pulsed electric field (PEF) applied separately or in combination with ultrasound (US + PEF) let to obtain similar or slightly lower content of bioactive compounds in comparison to untreated peppers. When sonication (US) and combined treatment as PEF + US were applied; in most cases reduction of bioactive compounds concentration occurred.

31505449,"Chromoplasts are typical plastids of fruits and flowers, deriving from chloroplasts through complex processes of re-organization and recycling. Since this transition leads to the production of reactive species, chromoplasts are characteristic sites for biosynthesis and accumulation of carotenoids and other antioxidants. Here, we have analysed the chromoplast membranes from Capsicum annuum L. fruits, finding a significant expression of the capsanthin/capsorubin synthase. This enzyme was isolated by a very mild procedure allowing its analyses under quasi-native conditions. The isolated complex appeared as a red coloured homo-trimer, suggesting the retention of at least one of the typical carotenoids from C. annuum. Moreover, the protein complex was co-purified with a non-proteinaceous fraction of carotenoid aggregates carrying a high molecular weight and separable only by Size Exclusion Chromatography. This last finding suggested a relationship between the carotenoids synthesis on chromoplast membranes, the presence, and storage of organised carotenoids aggregates typical for chromoplasts. Further MS analyses also provided important hints on the interactome network associated to the capsanthin/capsorubin synthase, confirming its functional relevance during ripening.

29131855,"Patients suffering from Refsum's disease show mutations in the enzyme necessary for the degradation of phytanic acid. Accumulation of this tetramethyl-branched fatty acid in inner organs leads to severe neurological and cardiac dysfunctions which can even result in death. Thus, patients with Refsum's disease have to follow a specific diet resigning foods with high levels of phytanic acid and trans-phytol like products from ruminant animals with a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of ≤ 10 mg/d. We recently reported the occurrence of phytyl fatty acid esters (PFAE, trans-phytol esterified with a fatty acid) in bell pepper with trans-phytol amounts of up to 5.4 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW). In this study we carried out in vitro-digestion experiments of PFAE with artificial digestion fluids. Our results demonstrate that PFAE actually are a source for bioavailable trans-phytol and thus add to the TDI. Eating only one portion of bell pepper (∼150 g) could therefore lead to exploitation of the TDI of up to 81%.

28060498,"The aromatic descriptor ""green"", reflecting grape unripeness in French red wines, is frequently associated with the levels of 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines, particularly 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP), which has bell pepper nuances. Nevertheless, not all green aromatic expressions in red wines correlate with 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazine concentrations. This study considered sensory and chemical approaches using Cabernet Sauvignon wines obtained from grapes harvested at one-month intervals during the 2014 and 2015 vintages to investigate other volatile odoriferous compounds. Semipreparative HPLC fractionation of wine extracts revealed a fraction with specific green aromas in the early harvest wines. Its sensory impact was confirmed by omission and reconstitution tests. Then, multidimensional gas chromatography coupled with olfactometry and mass spectrometry (MDGC-O-MS/TOF) was used for molecular characterization of the aroma compounds associated with the green aromas. Surprisingly, eucalyptol (1,8-cineole), with menthol odor was highlighted and assayed at concentrations sometimes above its olfactory detection threshold in Cabernet Sauvignon and Fer Servadou wines. Sensory tests confirmed its impact at several concentrations detected in French red wines (up to 2.61 ± 0.03 μg/L) on the menthol nuance and overall green perception, particularly via an additive effect with IBMP. Quantitation of 1,8-cineole in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes during berry development in 2015 revealed its varietal origin with abundant concentrations in unripe berries and decrease during grape maturation.

The method performance, including linearity, recovery, limits of detection (LOD), and quantitation (LOQ), was satisfactory. Throughout the experimental period, the residual levels of flonicamid and TFNG were not uniform, whereas that of TFNA remained constant. The total sum of the residues (flonicamid and its metabolites) was higher in the vinyl house with shade cover than in the glass house, under various conditions.

The adsorbent (Fe3O4@SiO2@GO-PEA) was then used in a magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of six organophosphorous pesticides (OPPs) including methyl parathion, fenitrothion, methidathion, ethion, methyl azinphos and coumaphos prior to gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus detection (GC-NPD). The fabricated adsorbent combines the advantages of superior adsorption capability of modified GO and magnetic separability of magnetite microparticles to provide high adsorption capacity, and easy isolation from sample solutions. The main experimental parameters affecting the extraction recovery of OPPs including extraction time, pH, adsorbent dosage, salt concentration, and desorption conditions were investigated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, linear responses were obtained in the concentration range of 0.06-200μgL(-1) with the determination coefficients (R(2)) between 0.9945 and 0.9996. The limits of detection were from 0.02 to 0.1μgL(-1) and the intraday and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 4.8 and 6.4%, respectively.

26018628,"An efficient extraction and analysis method was developed for the isolation and quantification of n-alkanes from bell peppers of different geographical locations. Five extraction techniques, i.e., accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), ball mill extraction, ultrasonication, rinsing, and shaking, were quantitatively compared using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Rinsing of the surface wax layer of freeze-dried bell peppers with chloroform proved to be a relatively quick and easy method to efficiently extract the main n-alkanes C27, C29, C31, and C33. A combined cleanup and fractionation approach on Teflon-coated silica SPE columns resulted in clean chromatograms and gave reproducible results (recoveries 90-95 %). The GC-MS method was reproducible (R(2) = 0.994-0.997, peak area standard deviation = 2-5%) and sensitive (LODs, S/N = 3, 0.05-0.15 ng/μL). The total main n-alkane concentrations were in the range of 5-50 μg/g dry weight. Seed extractions resulted in much lower total amounts of extracted n-alkanes compared to flesh and surface extractions, demonstrating the need for further improvement of pre-concentration and cleanup. The method was applied to 131 pepper samples from four different countries, and by using the relative n-alkane concentration ratios, Dutch peppers could be discriminated from those of the other countries, with the exception of peppers from the same cultivar.

The qualitative and quantitative determination of the major and minor capsaicinoids; alkaloids responsible for the pungency level, has been performed by a validated chromatographic procedure (HPLC-DAD) after a preliminary drying step and an opportune extraction procedure. Concentrations of total capsaicinoids varied from a not detectable value for Bell pepper to 31.84 mg g(-1) dried weight for Chiltepín. Samples were obtained from plants grown in experimental field and in greenhouse without temperature control, in order to evaluate temperature effect. Analysis of the two principal capsaicinoids in fruits showed that the amount of dihydrocapsaicin was always higher than capsaicin.

23314817,"Chromoplasts are unique plastids that accumulate massive amounts of carotenoids. To gain a general and comparative characterization of chromoplast proteins, this study performed proteomic analysis of chromoplasts from six carotenoid-rich crops: watermelon, tomato, carrot, orange cauliflower, red papaya, and red bell pepper. Stromal and membrane proteins of chromoplasts were separated by 1D gel electrophoresis and analysed using nLC-MS/MS. A total of 953-2262 proteins from chromoplasts of different crop species were identified. Approximately 60% of the identified proteins were predicted to be plastid localized. Functional classification using MapMan bins revealed large numbers of proteins involved in protein metabolism, transport, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and redox in chromoplasts from all six species. Seventeen core carotenoid metabolic enzymes were identified. Phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, ζ-carotene desaturase, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 were found in almost all crops, suggesting relative abundance of them among the carotenoid pathway enzymes. Chromoplasts from different crops contained abundant amounts of ATP synthase and adenine nucleotide translocator, which indicates an important role of ATP production and transport in chromoplast development. Distinctive abundant proteins were observed in chromoplast from different crops, including capsanthin/capsorubin synthase and fibrillins in pepper, superoxide dismutase in watermelon, carrot, and cauliflower, and glutathione-S-transferease in papaya.

Headspace analysis was performed by a Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometer (SIFT-MS). After blanching, (Z)-3-hexenal had a large significant decrease in concentration since it is a heat labile compound while most other volatiles did not change in concentration. The freezing process increased volatile levels in the puree only. Slow freeze peppers had higher levels of some LOX generated volatiles during storage than quick freeze. During frozen storage of blanched samples (E)-2-hexenal, (Z and E)-hexen-1-ol, and (E)-2-pentenal increased likely because of nonenzymatic autoxidation of fatty acids while other volatiles remained constant. In Raw Whole peppers, (Z)-3-hexenal, hexanal, and 2-pentylfuran were generated during storage likely because the LOX enzyme is still active during frozen storage. However, blanched samples had higher concentrations of (E)-2-hexenal, (Z and E)-hexen-1-ol, 1-penten-3-one, and (E)-2-heptenal because of enzymatic destruction of these volatiles in the raw samples. The levels of many of the volatiles in the raw samples, including (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z and E)-hexen-1-ol, hexanal, (E)-2-pentenal, and 2-pentylfuran, appeared to peak around 34 d after freezing.

The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) develop a procedure using headspace solid phase micro-extraction combined with GC-MS in the selected ion monitoring mode (HS-SPME-GC-MS-SIM) for analysis of MIBP in grape berries, and (2) determine the location of MIBP biosynthesis in grapevines by approach grafting clusters of Vitis vinifera L. cvs Cabernet Sauvignon and Muscat blanc onto each other. The soluble solids and pH of the grape juice/homogenate matrix from different grape berry developmental stages influenced the method precision; therefore, quantification via the method of standard addition was used. Using our developed method, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of MIBP were 0.1 ng L(-1) and 2 ng L(-1), respectively, measured in a model juice and non-MIBP containing Chardonnay juice. Spiked recoveries averaged between 91% and 112% in Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir homogenates and the overall relative standard deviation was less than 10%. The method was used to analyze MIBP in 29 grape cultivars and in fruit from clusters grafted to Cabernet Sauvignon or Muscat vines. Quantifiable levels were found only in Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc and Semillon, providing information on the genetic connection for the occurrence of MIBP in grapes. No MIBP was detected in the berries of Muscat blanc clusters grafted onto Cabernet Sauvignon vines when sampled at fruit maturity.

20707309,"Environmental factors affecting degradation of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP, ""green pepper aroma"") in wine grapes (V. vinifera) are widely studied, but the degradation pathway is not defined. We hypothesized that IBMP is demethylated to 3-isobutyl-2-hydroxypyrazine (IBHP) during fruit maturation effectively reversing the final putative step of IBMP biosynthesis. A quantification method for IBHP was developed using solid-phase extraction coupled to one- or two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a recovery of ca. 80%. IBMP and IBHP in bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) and V. vinifera (cv. 'Cabernet Franc', 'Riesling', 'Pinot noir') were then measured at different maturities. IBMP and IBHP were inversely correlated in both bell peppers (R2=0.958) and Cabernet Franc grapes (R2=0.998) over a range of maturities. In bell peppers, we observed a significant decline in IBMP (125 to 15 ng/mL) and increase in IBHP (undetectable to 42 ng/mL) during ripening. In grapes, all cultivars had comparable IBHP concentrations preveraison (64 to 88 pg/mL) but differed in IBHP concentration by 2 orders of magnitude at the final sampling point (undetectable to 235 pg/mL). Higher preveraison IBMP was correlated with higher final IBHP across the three grape cultivars, with the order Cabernet Franc>Riesling>Pinot noir for both IBMP and IBHP.

Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) was used as a template molecule. A molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedure was developed for further application in the analysis of FB. The performance of the MIP throughout the clean-up of spiked bell pepper, rice and corn flake sample extracts was compared with the results obtained when using non-imprinted polymer, C(18), strong anion exchange and immunoaffinity sorbents. Extracts were analysed for FB with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after clean-up. Depending on the food matrix and the concentration range of the fumonisins, recoveries after MISPE varied from 62 to 86%, from 62 to 83%, and from 67 to 81% for fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)), fumonisin B(2) (FB(2)) and fumonisin B(3) (FB(3)), respectively. The selectivity of the synthesized MIP for mycotoxins belonging to the group of FB was confirmed by evaluating cross-reactivity from analogue structures and other mycotoxins. Analysis of 39 naturally contaminated samples (corn flakes) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry indicated that the synthesized MIP could be an excellent alternative for clean-up and pre-concentration of FB in food samples. Pearson correlations between immunoaffinity clean-up and MISPE were calculated and amounted to 0.923 for FB(1), 0.808 for FB(2), and 0.759 for FB(3).

19021793,"Farmstead Cheddar cheeses with natural bandage wrappings have a distinctive flavor profile that is appealing to many consumers. An earthy/bell pepper (EBP) flavor has been previously recognized in some of these cheeses. This study characterized the alkylmethoxypyrazine compounds causing EBP flavor in Farmstead Cheddar cheeses. Eight cheeses were divided into inner, outer, rind, and wrapper sections, and tested for descriptive sensory and instrumental analyses. To assess reproducibility of EBP flavor, cheeses from the same facilities were purchased and tested after 6 and 12 mo. EBP flavor was detected in four out of 8 Farmstead Cheddar cheeses by a trained sensory panel. 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine were identified as the main sources of EBP flavor in these cheeses by GC/O and GC/MS. In general, those alkylmethoxypyrazines were prevalent in the wrapper (106 to 730 ppb) and rind (39 to 444 ppb) sections of the cheeses. They were either not detected in inner and outer sections of the cheeses or were present at low concentrations. These results suggest that 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine are formed near the surface of the cheeses and migrate into the cheese during ripening. Threshold values in water and whole milk were 1 and 16 ppt for 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine, and 0.4 and 2.3 ppt for 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, respectively.

17263473,"Because of the individual biological effects and the uncertain or missing information on levels of tocopherols (T) and tocotrienols (T3) in foods frequently consumed in Hawaii, 79 food items (50 in duplicate) were analyzed for alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol (alphaT, betaT, gammaT, and deltaT) and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol (alphaT3, betaT3, gammaT3, and deltaT3) in addition to alpha-tocopheryl acetate (alphaTac). Foods from local markets were stored according to usual household habits, freeze-dried, homogenized, and extracted three times with hexane containing butylated hydroxytoluene as a preservative and tocol as an internal standard. A normal-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography system was applied with fluorescence and photodiode array detection that resulted in baseline separation of all eight analytes and the internal standard tocol (To). The sum of all E vitamer concentrations, or total E vitamers (TEV), in all foods analyzed ranged an average from 0.6 to 828 mg/kg (T < or = 542 mg/kg and T3 < or = 432 mg/kg) and showed the following ranges: oils, 497-828 mg/kg (mainly alphaT and gammaT); margarines, 359-457 mg/kg (mainly gammaT); salad dressings, 20-291 mg/kg (mainly gammaT, except alphaT when soy oil was the main ingredient); cookies, 54-138 mg/kg (mainly gammaT); snacks, 101-220 mg/kg (mainly gammaT); nuts, 22-201 mg/kg (mainly alphaT); vegetables, 2-152 mg/kg (mainly alphaT); pasta, 24-90 mg/kg; cereals, 4-56 mg/kg (mainly betaT3 followed by alphaT); fish, 2-39 mg/kg (mainly alphaT); fried tofu, 64 mg/kg (mainly gammaT); breads, 20-22 mg/kg (mainly betaT3); fat-free mayonnaise, 5 mg/kg (mainly alphaT); poi (fermented taro root), 2 mg/kg (mostly alphaT); and fruits, 2 (papaya) to 13 mg/kg (canned pumpkin) with alphaT predominating. Cereals fortified with alphaTac ranked third and eighth among all foods assayed regarding alphaT and TEV levels, respectively. As compared to the few data available in the literature, our values agreed with some (corn flakes, mango fruit, fat-free mayonnaise, dry-roasted macadamia nuts, dry-roasted peanuts, mixed nuts, spaghetti/marinara pasta sauce, oils, and red bell pepper) but differed for many other items.

The combination of a novel strategy for database-independent detection of proteins from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data with standard database searches allowed us to identify 151 proteins with a high level of confidence. These include several well-known plastid proteins but also novel proteins that were not previously reported from other plastid proteome studies. The majority of the identified proteins are active in plastid carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Among the most abundant individual proteins are capsanthin/capsorubin synthase and fibrillin, which are involved in the synthesis and storage of carotenoids that accumulate to high levels in chromoplasts. The relative abundances of the identified chromoplast proteins differ remarkably compared with their abundances in other plastid types, suggesting a chromoplast-specific metabolic network.

Most aroma-active components of acidic and neutral/basic fractions have been previously associated with Cheddar cheese flavor. p-Cresol was mainly responsible for a ""cowy-barny"" note, whereas an intense ""soil-like"" note was due to 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine. At much lower odor intensity, 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine contributed a ""bell pepper-like"" note.

Previously, we showed that fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase from bell pepper fruits is a heme protein whose spectrophotometric properties greatly resemble a cytochrome P450. In order to ascertain the relationship of it to the P450 gene family, we have cloned cDNA encoding fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase from immature bell pepper fruits. The cDNA encodes 480 amino acids, and shares homology with P450s mostly at the C terminus. The heme binding cysteine is recognizable at position 441. The most closely related P450 is allene oxide synthase (CYP74A), with which it has 40% identity. It qualifies the lyase as a member of a new P450 subfamily, CYP74B.

1381358,"Cysteine synthase (O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase) has been purified to homogeneity from bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) fruit chromoplasts. This enzyme consists of two subunits of 35 kDa. Immunocytochemical localization experiments confirmed the plastid location of this enzyme. A full-length cDNA was isolated from an expression library of C. annuum. The deduced peptide sequence revealed high similarity between the C. annuum cysteine synthase and its bacterial counterparts. In vitro transcription and translation of the cDNA and subsequent import experiments demonstrated that the encoded cysteine synthase is located in the plastids. The steady-state level of the cysteine synthase mRNA is almost constant in dark-grown hypocotyls, leaves, and fruits. However, a slight increase in this mRNA level was detected during fruit development (when the 25 S rRNA was taken as an internal standard). Similarly, the cysteine synthase activity in plastids was found to increase during fruit development and reaches the highest levels in the chromoplasts of red fruits. To address the physiological role of this phenomenon, we have shown that cysteine is engaged in the active metabolism of glutathione. Thus, in connection with the previous demonstration of an active tocopherol metabolism, it is concluded that differentiation of chloroplast to chromoplast in C. annuum involves an active synthesis of potential antioxidants or redox modulators.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D000595', 'D002212', 'D002736', 'D002845', 'D002846', 'D002850', 'D002852', 'D003001', 'D003547', 'D004247', 'D017886', 'D006882', 'D008969', 'D008970', 'D010946', 'D012313', 'D012333', 'D011994', 'D012689', 'D014158']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Capsicum', 'Chloroplasts', 'Chromatography', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine Synthase', 'DNA', 'Durapatite', 'Hydroxyapatites', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'RNA', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",Cysteine synthase from Capsicum annuum chromoplasts.
