35382700,"This study aimed to assess the levels of selected pesticides residues in harvested tomatoes and their associated dietary risks to consumers at Makambako Town in Njombe region, Tanzania. Forty-two fresh tomatoes were sampled among tomato farmers during harvesting season and extraction of analytes was done using QuEChERS method and analysed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer. Residues of chlorpyrifos, profenofos, gamma cyhalothrin and cypermethrin were alternatingly detected in 78.51% of samples. The average concentrations of residues were 0.014, 0.056, 0.003 and 0.2 mg/kg for chlorpyrifos, profenofos, gamma cyhalothrin and cypermethrin and were all below their respective Codex MRLs. The highest concentration was 0.718 mg/kg for cypermethrin, above the Codex MRL of 0.2 mg/kg. The hazard indexes indicate no potential health hazards to the general population due to the lifetime consumption of fresh tomatoes from the study area. Periodic monitoring of residue levels of pesticides in vegetable fruits, including tomatoes, is recommended.","Food additives & contaminants.

35347716,"Fermentation of eight vegetables was studied as an alternative for reclamation of surplus volumes. Fermentation performance was predicted by comparing the amounts of acid that could be produced from the intrinsic sugar content with that buffered by the fresh vegetable matrices prior to reaching an inhibitory pH for fermentative microbes (3.30). Native fermentations were brined with 345.0 mM sodium chloride, 40.0 mM calcium chloride, 6.0 mM potassium sorbate, and vinegar to adjust the initial pH to 4.70. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis, pH, and carbon dioxide measurements and spiral plating on selective media were employed to monitor the progress of fermentations. The average colony counts for yeast and/or molds and Enterobacteriaceae declined to undetectable levels from 3.6 ± 1.5 log CFU/ml within 7 days of fermentation. The fermentation of sugars produced lactic, acetic, succinic, and/or malic acids, and ethanol. As predicted, the fermentation of vegetables with low sugar content, such as broccoli, green leaf lettuce, and green pea proceeded to completion. The fermentation of vegetables with a moderate sugar content, such as green bell pepper, red ripened tomato, and green bean were incomplete at pH 3.1 ± 0.2. The fermentation of high sugar vegetables including sweet potato and corn were expected and observed to be incomplete. It is concluded that the intrinsic sugar content and buffer capacity of surplus vegetables are relevant parameters in obtaining complete fermentations. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Vegetables are the second most wasted commodity in the United States and a substantial constituent of the global food waste. Development of fermentation to reclaim surplus vegetables from farms, grocery stores, and farmer's markets offers opportunities to ameliorate economic losses and environmental impact and add value to waste. The research described here suggests that a fraction of vegetables could be fermented in cover brines while others, with high sugar content, need specialized handling. Evidently, optimization of vegetable fermentation with starter cultures and added buffers represent an opportunity to stimulate complete bioconversions useful for reclaiming surplus volumes.",Journal of food science,[],[],Vegetable fermentations brined with low salt for reclaiming food waste.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35347716,2022
35325205,"Nucleus-encoded circular RNAs (ncircRNAs) have been widely detected in eukaryotes, and most circRNA identification algorithms are designed to identify them. However, using these algorithms, few mitochondrion-encoded circRNAs (mcircRNAs) have been identified in plants, and the role of plant mcircRNAs has not yet been addressed. Here, we developed a circRNA identification algorithm, mitochondrion-encoded circRNA identifier (MeCi), based on common features of plant mitochondrial genomes. We identified 7,524, 9,819, 1,699, 1,821, 1,809, and 5,133 mcircRNAs in maize (Zea mays), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), and grape (Vitis vinifera), respectively. These mcircRNAs were experimentally validated. Plant mcircRNAs had distinct characteristics from ncircRNAs, and they were more likely to be derived from RNA degradation but not intron backsplicing. Alternative circularization was prevalent in plant mitochondria, and most parental genomic regions hosted multiple mcircRNA isoforms, which have homogenous 5' termini but heterogeneous 3' ends. By analysis of mitopolysome and mitoribosome profiling data, 1,463 mcircRNAs bound to ribosomes were detected in maize and Arabidopsis. Further analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data identified 358 mcircRNA-derived polypeptides. Overall, we developed a computational pipeline that efficiently identifies plant mcircRNAs, and we demonstrated mcircRNAs are widespread and translated in plants.",Plant physiology,[],[],Mitochondrion-encoded circular RNAs are widespread and translatable in plants.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35325205,2022
35304759,"Pesticide residue in food commodities is a serious concern in relation to consumer safety and also the most significant barrier in the trade of food commodities. The dissipation pattern of four insecticides, namely novaluron, λ-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid, and fenazaquin, was evaluated on tomato fruits and cropped soil. The residues were extracted using the QuEChERS analytical method and quantized using a gas chromatograph with electron capture detector, gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, and high-performance liquid chromatography with photo diode array detector. The analytical method was validated using parameters like recovery, linearity, accuracy, matrix effect, and specificity, with limit of detection and limit of quantitation established to be 0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively, for all the pesticides. The average initial deposits (samples collected after 2 h of application) at the recommended dose of novaluron, λ-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid, and fenazaquin were 0.593, 0.293, 0.227, and 0.431 mg/kg on tomato fruits, respectively, and were below the limit of quantification in soil. The pre-harvest interval of 17, 8, 1, and 13 days was suggested for novaluron, λ-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid, and fenazaquin on tomato, respectively.

35243353,"Flubendiamide (FBD) is the first commercially available phthalic acid diamide that targets ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in insects, which play a major role in lepidoptera control. However, excessive use of FBD can influence the quality of treated products leading to toxic effects on human health. The availability of rapid and convenient methods for evaluating FBD amount in the environment is necessary. Therefore, analytical methods were developed for the determination of residues of FBD and its metabolite desiodo in different food matrices like tomato, cabbage, pigeon pea, apple, chilli and rice. The current review carries forward methods for FBD residues analysis in foods by using several chromatographic techniques including sample preparation steps. The comparison between the different methods employed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of food quality and safety is also discussed. Liquid chromatography (LC) is the predominant analytical method for assessing the quality of foods treated with FBD. Studies related to LC coupled multichannel detector (Ultraviolet (UV), Mass spectrometry (MS)) are also applied to detect pesticide residues.

DHCP attracts attention due to its cytotoxicity as well as potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its effects and the difficulty of its identification in food are mediated in part by the formation of Michael adducts of DHCP with amino acids. The results revealed that DHCP reacted efficiently with cysteine and glutathione, and to a lesser extent with histidine.

Though the non-edible parts of plants are not eaten by human beings directly, these parts are consumed by livestock and other animals, thereby facilitating the flow of chemical residues through the food chain. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the concentration of OCP residues in non-edible plant parts to provide insights on their potential ecotoxicological impacts. Eighteen OCP residues were extracted in nine different plant species (banana Musa acuminate, brinjal Solanum melongena, Casuarina equisetifolia, Eucalyptus globulus, lotus Nelumbo nucifera, paddy Oryza sativa, sugarcane Saccharum officinarum, tapioca Manihot esculenta, tomato Lycopersicon esculentum) following QuEChERS method. The concentrations of OCP residues in plant extracts were determined using Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The OCP residues, namely: γ-HCH (lindane), heptachlor epoxide isomer, dieldrin, endrin, endrin aldehyde and endrin ketone were found predominantly in seven plant species. Residues of γ-HCH (lindane) were reported in different parts of plant species such as stem (581.14 ng/g in paddy and 585.82 ng/g in tapioca) and leaf (583.3 ng/g in tomato). Seven samples contained residues of heptachlor epoxide isomer (512.53 to 1173.8 ng/g). Dieldrin was found in paddy stem (489.97 ng/g), tapioca stem (490.21 ng/g) and tapioca leaf (490.32 ng/g). The detected OCPs in the present study were 10-50 times higher than the Maximum Residue Limits (MRL, 0.01-0.1 mg/Kg) as prescribed in the Codex Alimentarius of the FAO/WHO.

In the present study, 50% of culture filtrate supplemented into PDA medium absolutely inhibited mycelial growth of B. cinerea whereas the highest concentration (960 mg/L) of different crude extracts including ethyl acetate, chloroform, and n-butanol crude extracts of B. velezensis CE 100, strongly inhibited mycelial growth of B. cinerea with the highest inhibition of 79.26%, 70.21% and 69.59% respectively, resulting in severe damage to hyphal structures with bulging and swellings. Hence, the antifungal compound responsible was progressively separated from ethyl acetate crude extract using medium pressure liquid chromatography. The purified compound was identified as methyl hippurate by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The inhibitory effect of methyl hippurate on both spore germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea was revealed by its dose-dependent pattern. The spore germination rate was completely restricted at a concentration of 3 mg/mL of methyl hippurate whereas no mycelial growth was observed in agar medium supplemented with 4 mg/mL and 6 mg/mL of methyl hippurate by poisoned food method. Microscopic imaging revealed that the morphologies of spores were severely altered by long-time exposure to methyl hippurate at concentrations of 1 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL and 3 mg/mL and hyphae of B. cinerea were severely deformed by exposure to methyl hippurate at concentrations of 2 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL and 6 mg/mL. No significant inhibition on tomato seed germination was observed in treatments with methyl hippurate (2 mg/mL) for both 6 h and 12 h soaking period as compared to the controls. Based on these results, B. velezensis CE 100 could be considered a potential agent for development of environmentally friendly disease control strategies as a consequence of the synergetic interactions of diverse crude metabolites and methyl hippurate.",World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,"['D001407', 'D020171', 'D005659', 'D006626', 'D025301', 'D018551', 'D010935', 'D013172']","['Bacillus', 'Botrytis', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Hippurates', 'Hyphae', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Plant Diseases', 'Spores, Fungal']","Antifungal compound, methyl hippurate from Bacillus velezensis CE 100 and its inhibitory effect on growth of Botrytis cinerea.","['Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000382', 'Q000382', 'Q000187']","['chemistry', 'drug effects', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', 'microbiology', 'microbiology', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420104,2021

However, there is a lack of a comprehensive comparative study that facilitates deep knowledge about the benefits of using each technique. In the present study, the same mass spectrometer was used coupled to both liquid and supercritical fluid chromatographies with a multiresidue method of 215 compounds, for the analysis of pesticide residues in food samples. Through the injection of the spiked extracts, separate experiments were conducted. A study of the optimum ion source temperature using the different chromatography modes was performed. The results were evaluated in terms of sensitivity with tomato, leek, onion, and orange as representative fruit and vegetable matrices. The compounds which reported the highest area values in each chromatography were evaluated through their substance groups and polarity values. The impact of matrix effects obtained in tomato matrix was similar for both cases; however, SFC clearly showed better results in analyzing matrices with a higher number of natural co-extracted compounds. This can be explained by the combination of two effects: (i) chromatography separation and (ii) ion source efficiency. The chromatographic elution presented different profiles of matrix components, which had diverse impact on the coelution with the analytes, being more beneficial when SFC was used in the matrices studied. The data showed that the best results obtained in SFC are also related to a higher ionization efficiency even when the ESI emitter tip was not optimized for SFC flow.

The presence of secondary metabolites, namely polyphenols, carotenoids and terpenes, in certain food matrices seems to contribute to their functional properties, expressed through an increased prevention in the development of certain chronic diseases, namely coronary heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and diabetes. However, some foods' volatile secondary metabolites also present important bioactive properties, although this is a poorly scientifically explored field. In this context, and in order to explore the potential bioactivity of volatile metabolites in different vegetables and fruits from regular consumption, the volatile composition was established using a green extraction technique, solid phase microextraction in headspace mode (HS-SPME), combined with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 320 volatile metabolites, comprising 51 terpenic compounds, 45 organosulfur compounds, 31 aldehydes, 37 esters, 29 ketones, 28 alcohols, 23 furanic compounds, 22 hydrocarbons, 19 benzene compounds, 13 nitrogenous compounds, 9 carboxylic acids, 7 ethers, 4 halogenated compounds and 3 naphthalene derivatives, were positively identified.

Moreover, antioxidant activities were evaluated by four chemical-based assays, and the influences of thermal treatment on the carotenoids in orange-colored tomatoes rich in tetra-cis (7Z, 9Z, 7'Z, and 9'Z)-lycopene, phytofluene, and phytoene were studied. The nine orange-colored tomatoes (OT) were divided into two categories: OT-B, containing five cultivars rich in β-carotene, and OT-L, containing the other four cultivars that were abundant in tetra-cis-lycopene, phytofluene, and phytoene. The antioxidant activities of OT-L were higher than those of OT-B and the SD-2 cultivar in OT-L showed similar antioxidant activity to the red tomatoes. During thermal processing, tetra-cis-lycopene in SD-2 decreased about 38% after being exposed to heat for 2 hr at 80 °C, while its content was still higher than other lycopene isomers. Other-Z-lycopenes and all-trans (E)-lycopene increased from 2.36 ± 0.19 to 14.73 ± 1.16 µg/g fresh weight (FW) and 0.75 ± 0.10 to 5.91 ± 1.02 µg/g FW, respectively.

The two main reasons are (i) the lower sensitivity especially in the case of the fragment ions produced and (ii) the lack of familiarity and an understanding of the most appropriate combination of HRMS acquisition modes to use. In fact, the number of different acquisition modes can appear as a puzzle to inexperienced users. This work was therefore focused on obtaining experimental data to gain a better understanding of the extended acquisition capabilities of a new Q-Orbitrap platform. Experimental data were obtained for 244 pesticides and their degradation products in commodities of varying matrix complexity (tomato, onion, avocado, and orange) using various combinations of acquisition modes. The best results for targeted analysis were obtained with a combination of full scan (FS), all-ions fragmentation (AIF) and target MS2 (tMS2) modes, and for non-target analysis using full scan (FS) and data-dependent MS2 (ddMS2) modes. All these acquisition modes (FS, AIF, tMS2, and ddMS2) could be applied simultaneously with cycle times ≤ 1 s. The tMS2 especially, proved to be a very powerful approach to increase sensitivity for MS2 fragments and identification rates. Overall, the results for the various pesticide-commodity combinations were fully satisfactory in terms of limit of quantitation (LOQ) repeatability and identification when considered against the SANTE EU Guideline criteria. In addition, the screening capabilities were evaluated for a non-target survey with the use of spectral libraries, the presence of non-target compounds was detected, thus proving the efficacy of the proposed approach. Another issue often overlooked is the optimization of use of spectral libraries, but in our experiments the compounds present in these libraries were not blindly sought in the screening analyses. To minimize the potential for false positives detects in our study, the extractability of the compounds present in the libraries, was also taken into account. The extractability of compounds using a QuEChERS acetonitrile procedure was estimated based on the physicochemical properties of target compounds. By removing compounds that will not be extracted, reduces the occurrences of false detects, reducing the time required for data processing and thus improving the efficiency of the overall screening workflow.",Talanta,"['D002851', 'D002853', 'D032084', 'D010573', 'D010575', 'D053719']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Pesticides', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Improving the simultaneous target and non-target analysis LC-amenable pesticide residues using high speed Orbitrap mass spectrometry with combined multiple acquisition modes.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773743,2021

However, recent evidence has highlighted possible effects of pesticide treatments on plant metabolism, with potential implications for fruit quality. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the impact of four different herbicides on the metabolic processes in industrial tomato plants. To this aim, plants were treated either with the selective herbicides metribuzin and rimsulfuron or with the non-selective herbicides glyphosate and pelargonic acid. Thereafter, leaves were analyzed using a metabolomics approach, and 247 differential compounds were selected by multivariate statistics and used to examine the changes at the molecular level. Data interpretation via the PlantCyc Pathway Tool revealed that the tested herbicides induced distinctive responses to the treatments, with the phytohormone profile (gibberellins and jasmonates) and secondary metabolism (including stress-related compounds, such as phenylpropanoids and glucosinolates) showing the largest modulation. Surprisingly, such metabolic reprogramming also affected several aspects of the fruits even though the herbicides were applied several weeks before, thus opening the possibility of effects on food quality.

The results indicated that moderately hydrophobic compounds including carbamazepine and lincomycin have average TSCF values of 0.43 and 0.79, respectively. The average uptake of DEET, estriol, acetaminophen, and bisphenol A was also measured as 0.34, 0.29, 0.22, and 0.1, respectively. The 2,4-dinitrotoluene was not detected in the stem transpiration stream and it was shown to degrade in the root zone. Based on these results together with plant physiology measurements, we concluded that physicochemical properties of the chemicals did predict uptake, however, the role of other factors should be considered in the prediction of TSCF. While NN model could predict TSCF based on physicochemical properties with acceptable accuracies (mean squared error less than 0.25), the results for 2,4-dinitrotoluene and other compounds confirm the needs for considering other parameters related to both chemicals (stability) and plant species (role of lipids, lignin, and cellulose).",The Science of the total environment,"['D001692', 'D018551', 'D016571', 'D018517', 'D018526', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Biological Transport', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Transpiration', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Investigating plant uptake of organic contaminants through transpiration stream concentration factor and neural network models.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181989,2020

By in vitro assay, VOCs generated by the antagonists belonging to the species A. subglaciale showed the highest inhibition percentage of the pathogen mycelial growth (65.4%). In vivo tests were conducted with tomatoes and grapes artificially inoculated with B. cinerea conidial suspension, and exposed to VOCs emitted by the most efficient antagonists of each species (AP1, AM10, AS14) showing that VOCs of AP1 (A. pullulans) reduced the incidence by 67%, partially confirmed by the in vitro results. Conversely, on table grape, VOCs produced by all the strains did not control the fungal incidence but were only reducing the infection severity (< 44.4% by A. pullulans; < 30.5% by A. melanogenum, and A. subglaciale). Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and subsequent gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry identified ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol as the most produced VOCs.

Recent evidences have shown that fungicides would exert a negative effect on gut microbiota and result in gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolism disorder on non-target organisms and even humans. However, research on residues and potential health risks of fungicides in daily consumed vegetables has received less attention compared to insecticides. In this study, we studied three widely applied fungicides, procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin, in China. We collected 551 samples of 10 different vegetables in 11 cities from Zhejiang province during 2015-2017. Three fungicides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The average apparent recoveries of three fungicides ranged from 84.2% to 110% with the relative standard deviations lower than 10%. The LOD values of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin was 2, 0.09, and 1 μg/kg, respectively. The levels of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin in those vegetables ranged from ND-875, ND-238, and ND-76 μg/kg, respectively. The highest mean concentrations of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin were found in eggplant (68 μg/kg), spinach (16.4 μg/kg), and kidney bean (4 μg/kg), respectively. Tomato (62.6% of samples), eggplant (44.3% of samples), and cucumber (41.6% of samples) were most frequently detected with fungicides. Solanaceous fruit vegetables have the highest detection rate than other vegetables, and fungicides were most frequently detected in winter. The mean concentrations of three fungicides in different vegetables were all below the maximum residue limits for the national food safety standards of China, and the health risks resulting from consuming those vegetables in adults and children were all within the safe ranges.

32208468,"Pesticides, widely used in modern agriculture, could potentially cause environmental pollution and affect human lives. Hence, the development of a highly sensitive sensing element to detect pesticide residues is crucial for food safety and ecosystem protection. Optical methods based on fluorescence properties provide an ideal approach for screening and quantification of these compounds in different medias including water, plant, and nutritional products. The development of fluorescence emitting carbon dot-based sensors for monitoring pesticides has attracted great attention in recent years. In comparison to other fluorophores, carbon dots have more promising optical features, higher quantum yields and better biocompatibility. This article aims to present a novel fluorescent sensing method of diazinon, glyphosate, and amicarbazone using plant-based carbon dots. A comprehensive characterization of carbon dots obtained from cauliflower was performed by methods including UV-visible, FTIR spectroscopy, fluorometry, AFM, DLS, and zeta sizer. Following this step, carbon dots were used to detect pesticides. The fluorescence quenching property of carbon dots has been utilized to identify detection limit of 0.25, 0.5, and 2 ng ml-1 for diazinon, amicarbazone, and glyphosate, respectively. Also, real sample study revealed that the detection of pesticides accompanied by our developed nano-sensor is repeatable and accurate.

Two polysaccharide-based columns were tested in this study, and the robustness of their combination with SFC was verified.

Here, RF-QDs were designed by two different color CdTe QDs. Based on the IFE, the AuNPs can quench the fluorescence of the RF-QDs. Because of the electrostatic attraction between protamine (PRO) and the AuNPs, the PRO can restore fluorescence effectively. Papain (PAP) can easily hydrolyze PRO and causes the quench of fluorescence quenching. The addition of CHL can inhibit PAP activity and restore the fluorescent signal. Through the characterization of the structural changes of PAP, the inhibition and mechanism of CHL on PAP activity were studied. The ability of CHL to inhibit PAP activity was evaluated by measuring the fluorescence of the RF-QDs. Under the optimal conditions, this sensing platform shows a response to CHL in the range of 0.34-2320 ng/mL and a detection limit of 0.0017 ng/mL. Based on the CHL inhibition of PAP activity, the RF-QDs showed good selectivity for CHL.

The superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in blood, and SOD, GR and lactoperoxidase (LPO) in milk were determined. Total antioxidant capacity (FRAP and ABTS assays), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls (PCs) were also measured. Milk fatty acid profile was investigated by gas chromatography. The results showed higher antioxidant capacity measured by FRAP or ABTS assays and a reduction in MDA in GM plasma than CON. All by-products enhanced the protection of milk proteins by oxidation, as evidenced by lower values of PCs compared with CON. GM supplementation increased PUFAn-6, due to increase in C18:2n-6, the main component of GM compared with CON. All by-products did not modify the nutritional indexes of milk fat.

In this study, ET production of several fungal pathogens was enhanced by light, probably through the free radicals produced by photochemical reactions. Real-time gas analysis showed a sharp increase in ET production when fungal cultures were moved from dark-to-light (DTL). Similarly, light accelerated ET production in the Botrytis cinerea-infected Arabidopsis thaliana plants even when pyrazinamide, the inhibitor for plant ET synthesis, was applied, suggesting that the fungus is responsible for ET production during host invasion. Furthermore, a sharp increase in ET production after DTL transition was observed in B. cinerea-infected tomatoes and grapes, but not in healthy or physically wounded fruits.

In the present work, we hence focused on combining field trials with dynamic modelling to simulate mass evolutions of the pesticide-plant-system for thiamethoxam applied to wheat, lettuce and tomato as three major food crops. Field trials were conducted with QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, which gave consistent maximum residue concentrations for thiamethoxam in wheat, lettuce and tomato. We used these residues to evaluate the related dietary risk of humans consuming these food crops. Our results indicated that thiamethoxam did not provide any unacceptable dietary risk for humans across these three food crops, which is in line with findings from previous studies.

31623116,"In general, greenhouse cultivation involves the rampant application of chemical fertilizers, with the aim of achieving high yields. Oversaturation with mineral nutrients that aid plant growth, development, and yield may lead to abiotic stress conditions. We explore the effects of excess magnesium on tomato plant metabolism, as well as tomato fruit quality using non-targeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic approaches. Tomato plants were subjected to three different experiments, including high magnesium stress (MgH), extremely high magnesium stress (MgEH), and a control with optimal nutrient levels. Leaves, roots, and fruits were harvested at 16 weeks following the treatment. A metabolic pathway analysis showed that the metabolism induced by Mg oversupply was remarkably different between the leaf and root. Tomato plants allocated more resources to roots by upregulating carbohydrate and polyamine metabolism, while these pathways were downregulated in leaves. Mg oversupply affects the fruit metabolome in plants. In particular, the relative abundance of threonic acid, xylose, fucose, glucose, fumaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, oxoglutaric acid, threonine, glutamic acid, phenylalanine, and asparagine responsible for the flavor of tomato fruits was significantly decreased in the presence of Mg oversupply. Altogether, we concluded that Mg oversupply leads to drastically higher metabolite transport from sources (fully expanded leaves) to sinks (young leaves and roots), and thus, produces unfavorable outcomes in fruit quality and development.",Metabolites,[],[],Comparative Metabolomics Unravel the Effect of Magnesium Oversupply on Tomato Fruit Quality and Associated Plant Metabolism.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623116,2020

Short-chain PFCAs (i.e., under C9) were mainly detected in vegetables; specifically, PFBA showed high concentration in tomato shoots. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots clearly showed that PFASs in vegetables were different from those of cultivated soil, air, and rainwater.

30993530,"Metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic acid hydroxy stearic acid (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi).

For the speciation of iAs the European standard EN:16802 based on anion exchange chromatography coupled to ICP-MS was used. The two market basket food groups cereals (including rice), and sweets and condiments (a mixed group of sugar, sweets, tomato ketchup and dressings), contained the highest iAs levels (means 9 and 7 μg iAs/kg), whereas other food groups, including fish, did not exceed 2 μg iAs/kg. Varying levels of iAs were found in separate samples of tomato ketchup, 2.4-26 μg/kg, and is suggested to be one reason of the rather high average level of iAs in the food group sweets and condiments. Some specific food products revealed iAs levels much higher, i.e. rice crackers 152 and Norway lobster 89 μg iAs/kg. The intake of iAs via food was estimated by data from two national consumption surveys, performed in 2010-11 (1797 adults) and 2003 (2259 children). The estimated median iAs intakes in adults and children were 0.047 and 0.095 μg/kg body weight and day, respectively.

Such extracts can contain protein that may theoretically represent a potential risk of IgE-mediated allergy. No method has yet been generally accepted or validated for assessment of the allergenic potential of proteins. For development of suitable methods datasets of allergenic and nonallergenic (or low allergenic) proteins are required that can serve, respectively, as positive and negative controls. However, data are unavailable on proteins that lack or have low allergenic potential. Here, low allergenic potential proteins are identified based on the assumption that proteins with established human exposure, but with a lack of an association with allergy, possess low allergenic potential. Proteins were extracted from sources considered to have less allergenic potential (corn, potato, spinach, rice, and tomato) as well as higher allergenic potential (wheat) regarding common allergenic foods. Proteins were identified and semi-quantified by label-free proteomic analysis conducted using mass spectrometry.

The use of high-ohmic resistor enabled the formation of stable electrospray of aqueous solutions at ambient conditions. In addition, corona discharge was avoided even with a high voltage applied. Quantitative analysis of vitamin B in water was successfully conducted by tip-ESI.

Fabric phase sorptive extraction combines the beneficial features of sol-gel derived microextraction sorbents with the rich surface chemistry of cellulose fabric substrate, which collectively form a highly efficient microextraction system. Fabric phase sorptive extraction membrane, when immersed directly into the sample matrix, may extract target analytes even when high percentage of matrix interferents are present. The technique also greatly simplifies sample preparation workflow. Most important fabric phase sorptive extraction parameters were investigated and optimized. The developed method displayed good linearity over the concentration range 0.5-500 ng/g. Under optimum experimental conditions, the limits of detection were found in the range of 0.033 to 0.136 ng/g. The relative standard deviations for the extraction of organophosphorus pesticides were < 5%. Subsequently, the new method was applied to beans, tomato, brinjal, and cabbage samples.

30105623,"Thermally labile pesticides (captafol, captan, dicofol, and folpet) are highly prone to suffer thermal degradation during sample introduction into a gas chromatograph (GC) to tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI), 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone (DCBP), and phthalimide (PI), respectively, mainly produced in the glass liner of the injector. This undesired behavior leads to inaccurate qualitative and quantitative results. Direct on-column injection (OCI) technique is evaluated as an alternative to avoid or minimize compound alteration during the analysis. This configuration was studied and evaluated for the determination of this group of thermally troublesome pesticides. The OCI inlet was operated in ""track oven"" temperature and connected to a wide-bore deactivated guard column that is itself connected to a capillary GC analytical column. This technique has demonstrated to be useful for avoiding degradation generated in the hot inlet. Limitations observed for OCI in routine analysis were injection volume, guard column length, and maintenance issues. Analytical standards spiked in vegetable solutions were injected in OCI, not observing any thermal degradation rate. On the contrary, classical splitless injection (SLI) produced high degradation rates in all cases. This OCI approach was validated in citrate QuEChERS extracts of tomato, apple, and orange matrices for these four compounds and their corresponding transformation products (THPI, DCBP, and PI), evaluating recoveries, repeatability, linearity, and matrix effect. This set-up enabled the correct identification and quantitation for most compounds at LOQs of 0.010 mg/kg in fruit and vegetable samples. The OCI grants evident differentiation between metabolites naturally occurring in food and thermal degradation products created during the analysis.

We describe the development of an LC-MS/MS method covering 17 toxins for investigating the natural occurrence of free and modified Alternaria toxins in tomato sauce, sunflower seed oil, and wheat flour. Target analytes included alternariol (AOH), AOH-3-glucoside, AOH-9-glucoside, AOH-3-sulfate, alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), AME-3-glucoside, AME-3-sulfate, altenuene, isoaltenuene, tenuazonic acid (TeA), tentoxin (TEN), altertoxin I and II, alterperylenol, stemphyltoxin III, altenusin, and altenuic acid III. Extensive optimization resulted in a time- and cost-effective sample preparation protocol and a chromatographic baseline separation of included isomers. Overall, adequate limits of detection (0.03-9 ng/g) and quantitation (0.6-18 ng/g), intermediate precision (9-44%), and relative recovery values (75-100%) were achieved. However, stemphyltoxin III, AOH-3-sulfate, AME-3-sulfate, altenusin, and altenuic acid III showed recoveries in wheat flour below 70%, while their performance was stable and reproducible. Our pilot study with samples from the Austrian retail market demonstrated that tomato sauces (n = 12) contained AOH, AME, TeA, and TEN in concentrations up to 20, 4, 322, and 0.6 ng/g, while sunflower seed oil (n = 7) and wheat flour samples (n = 9) were contaminated at comparatively lower levels. Interestingly and of relevance for risk assessment, AOH-9-glucoside, discovered for the first time in naturally contaminated food items, and AME-3-sulfate were found in concentrations similar to their parent toxins.

The absence of water in the mobile phase, also provided some important advantages regarding LC-MS/MS as (i) higher retention of polar compounds in the column, which elute with high sensitivity and good peak shape and (ii) a general increase of the sensitivity of the analysis, consequence of the high ionization and ion extraction efficiency. Pesticides evaluated were identified following the SANTE/11813/2017. At the spiking concentration of 5 μg/kg, 98% of the pesticides were identified in tomato, 98% in orange and 94% in leek, whereas for the concentration of 10 μg/kg all the compounds were identified in tomato and only spiromesifen was not identified in orange and leek. At the concentration of 20 μg/kg, spiromesifen was also identified in these two matrices. The linearity and reproducibility of the method were evaluated with results which guarantee high quality in the analytical measurements. Even though only 2 μL of final extract were injected, the sensitivity of the SFC method was enough to achieve stringent LOQs.Real samples, including 6 different fruits and vegetables, were analyzed by the SFC-MS/MS proposed method, the results being similar to those obtained by LC-MS/MS. The method was also applied to a proficiency test of fipronil in eggs with good results in all the cases.

29320571,"The fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea causes gray mold disease on various hosts, which results in serious economic losses. Over the past several decades, many kinds of fungicides have been used to successfully control the disease. Meanwhile, the uses of fungicides lead to environmental pollution as well as a potential threat to the human health by the chemical residues in tomato fruit. Also, the gray mold disease is difficult to control with fungicides. Therefore, exploring alternative measures such as biological controls could be the best choice to control the disease and alleviate damages caused by fungicides. In this study, we isolated and identified a novel Pseudomonas strain termed as QBA5 from healthy tomato plant based on the morphological, biochemical characteristics and molecular detection. The antifungal activity assays revealed that, in the presence of QBA5, conidia germination, germ tube elongation and mycelial growth of B. cinerea were significantly inhibited. Most importantly, QBA5 exerted a significant preventive effectiveness against gray mold on tomato fruits and plants. The possible mechanism of QBA5 involved in the inhibition of B. cinerea was investigated. It revealed that the conidia plasma membrane of B. cinerea was severely damaged by QBA5. Further, four different antifungal compounds in the supernatant of QBA5 were separated by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (PHPLC).

In this study, we observed the hydrolyzing activity of a fungus-inducible pepper carboxylesterase (PepEST) on cell walls of C. gloeosporioides, causing growth retardation of the fungus by blocking appressorium formation. To determine the cellular basis for the growth inhibition, we observed the localization of PepEST on the fungus and found the attachment of the protein on surfaces of conidia and germination tubes. Moreover, we examined the decomposition of cell-wall materials from the fungal surface after reaction with PepEST, which led to the identification of 1,2-dithiane-4,5-diol (DTD) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Exogenous DTD treatment did not elicit expression of defense-related genes in the host plant but did trigger the necrosis of C. gloeosporioides. Furthermore, the DTD compound displayed protective effects on pepper fruits and plants against C. gloeosporioides and C. coccodes, respectively. In addition, DTD was also effective in preventing other diseases, such as rice blast, tomato late blight, and wheat leaf rust.

Under the optimized conditions, the developed method exhibited a good linear range, low limits of detection, low relative standard deviations (<6.8%), good method recoveries between 80.8% and 117%, and high enrichment factors (51-106). For a better elucidation of the adsorption of the M-PPOP towards the analytes, the extraction performance of the M-PPOP for different types of organic compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenylurea insecticides, phenylurea herbicides and phenols was studied.

The approach is based on the use of reversed-phase C18nano columns with an integrated emitter, so that separation, ionization and detection are performed minimizing dead volumes. The use of nanoflow not only increases ionization efficiency and minimizes ionization suppression but also boost sensitivity compared to analytical-scale LC-MS methods. The nanoflow LC system was combined with full-scan high resolution mass spectrometry using a Q-Exactive Orbitrap instrument. The analytical performance was assessed for over 60 representative pesticides in five representative commodities (tomato, baby food, orange, fruit-based jam and olive oil).

28573856,"An aroma distillate was prepared by solvent extraction and subsequent SAFE distillation from Italian vine-ripe tomatoes eliciting an intense overall aroma. Application of gc/olfactometry and the aroma extract dilution analysis revealed 44 odor-active compounds, 42 of which could be identified. The highest odor activity value of 2048 was established for the green, grassy (Z)-3-hexenal, the metallic smelling trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal, the potato-like 3-(methylthio)propanal, and the caramel-like 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone. Of the further odorants, 13 compounds have previously not been reported as tomato odorants. Although most of these showed lower FD-factors, in particular, the coconut/dill-like smelling wine lactone ((3S,3aS,7aR)-3a,4,5,7a-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethylbenzofuran-2(3H)-one) appeared with a quite high FD factor. In addition, a fruity, almond-like odorant (6) with an FD factor of 1024 was detected. By application of high resolution mass spectrometry and polarity considerations, the structure of a methyl-2-ethoxytetrahydropyran isomer was suggested for 6. Four of the five possible isomers, the 3-methyl-, 4-methyl-, 5-methyl-, and 6-methyl-2-ethoxytetrahydropyran were synthesized and showed similar mass spectrometric patterns. However, these were excluded by their different retention indices. Although the synthesis of the remaining 2-methyl-2-ethoxytetrahydropyran resulted in only small yields, which were not sufficient for NMR measurements, this structure is very likely for 6. This compound was never reported as a food constituent before.

28434710,"In the last 10 years, the majority of the pesticide food control laboratories moved from GC-MS to GC-MS/MS as the preferred analytical technique to address GC amenable compounds. The main reason for this change was the negative impact on the single stage GC-MS analysis caused by the interference from coeluting matrix compounds. The new development of gas chromatography coupled to high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (GC-HRAMS) provides opportunities to overcome such matrix interferences as a result of its much higher selectivity; allowing laboratories to carry out full-scan analysis covering the most exigent analytical performance criteria. The aim of this work is the evaluation of the main analytical performance parameters for the multiresidue screening of pesticide residues by a gas chromatography-Orbitrap™ mass spectrometer in fruits and vegetables. Electron ionization and full-scan high resolution mass spectrometry was selected for this evaluation. Mass resolving power, selectivity, sensitivity, analyte identification and database generation are discussed in light of the analysis of various commodities and a large scope of pesticides. The selected operational conditions provided optimal mass accuracy, within ±1mDa and achieved LOQs of 10μg/kg or lower for practically all the selected pesticides and commodities. Applicability for quantitative residue analysis was verified by the validation of the 210 pesticides in four matrices (tomato, apple, leek and orange).

28300025,"The study was conducted to investigate matrix interferences using QuEChERS sample preparation to understand whether the dilution of matrix and/or the grouping of commodities can eliminate the need for selective individual matrix-matched standards in LC with tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis, and whether the calibration graph based on only one matrix can be used for quantification in the other matrixes. Matrix effects (MEs) were studied by comparing the slopes of calibration curves of the matrix-matched standards (diluted with mobile phase) vis-à-vis the solvent-based standards. The present study showed that MEs were dependent on the nature of both the commodity and the analyte. Among the test matrixes, the highest variability in ME was recorded in capsicum. Most of the pesticides showed signal suppression in tomato, capsicum, and cumin matrixes. In brinjal matrix, the signal of most of the pesticides showed slight enhancement. Due to the similar nature of the MEs in tomato and capsicum, these two commodities can be grouped together. Considering analyte variability, acetamiprid, 3-hydroxy carbofuran, dichlorvos, dimethoate, and spinosyn A and D showed no significant ME (≤20%) in tomato. Very high MEs (2360.9 and 1250.8%) were observed for quizalofop-p-tefuryl and tebuconazole, respectively. To check the effect of dilution in minimizing the ME, cucumber and brinjal matrixes were diluted 10×, and calibration curves were drawn with five concentration levels. It was found that about 60% of the total analyzed pesticides showed MEs ≤20%. In cumin, MEs ranged from -5.3% for triazophos to 661% for thiacloprid. Most of the pesticides showed recoveries in the acceptable range of 70-130% with calibration curves from both matrixes. To compensate for MEs, it is suggested that (1) tomato and capsicum matrixes, which show similar trends, can be grouped together; and (2) cucumber matrix, when diluted 10×, can be used to prepare calibration curves for the quantification of pesticides in various fruiting and cucurbit vegetable matrixes by LC-MS/MS.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002853', 'D005506', 'D010573', 'D017365', 'D053719', 'D014675']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Spices', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vegetables']",Evaluation of Matrix Effects in Multiresidue Analysis of Pesticide Residues in Vegetables and Spices by LC-MS/MS.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28300025,2017
28208834,"Vitamin D deficiency is a global concern. Much research has concentrated on the endogenous synthesis of vitamin D in human skin following exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-315 nm). In many regions of the world there is insufficient UV-B radiation during winter months for adequate vitamin D production, and even when there is sufficient UV-B radiation, lifestyles and concerns about the risks of sun exposure may lead to insufficient exposure and to vitamin D deficiency. In these situations, dietary intake of vitamin D from foods or supplements is important for maintaining optimal vitamin D status. Some foods, such as fatty fish and fish liveroils, certain meats, eggs, mushrooms, dairy, and fortified foods, can provide significant amounts of vitamin D when considered cumulatively across the diet. However, little research has focussed on assessing edible plant foods for potential vitamin D content. The biosynthesis of vitamin D in animals, fungi and yeasts is well established; it is less well known that vitamin D is also biosynthesised in plants. Research dates back to the early 1900s, beginning with in vivo experiments showing the anti-rachitic activity of plants consumed by animals with induced rickets, and in vitro experiments using analytical methods with limited sensitivity. The most sensitive, specific and reliable method for measuring vitamin D and its metabolites is by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These assays have only recently been customised to allow measurement in foods, including plant materials.

28108870,"There is a growing interest in the use of bioinoculants to assist mineral fertilizers in improving crop production and yield. Azotobacter and Pseudomonas are two agriculturally relevant strains of bacteria which have been established as efficient bioinoculants. An experiment involving addition of graded concentrations of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles was undertaken using log phase cultures of Azotobacter and Pseudomonas. Growth kinetics revealed a clear trend of gradual decrease with Pseudomonas; however, Azotobacter exhibited a twofold enhancement in growth with increase in the concentration of ZnO concentration. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), supported by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses, illustrated the significant effect of ZnO nanoparticles on Azotobacter by the enhancement in the abundance of globular biofilm-like structures and the intracellular presence of ZnO, with the increase in its concentration. It can be surmised that extracellular mucilage production in Azotobacter may be providing a barrier to the nanoparticles. Further experiments with Azotobacter by inoculation of wheat and tomato seeds with ZnO nanoparticles alone or bacteria grown on ZnO-infused growth medium revealed interesting results. Vigour index of wheat seeds reduced by 40-50% in the presence of different concentrations of ZnO nanoparticles alone, which was alleviated by 15-20%, when ZnO and Azotobacter were present together.

27561664,"Fruits harvested from off-season, greenhouse-grown tomato plants have a poor reputation compared to their in-season, garden-grown counterparts. Presently, there is a gap in knowledge with regard to the role of UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) in determining greenhouse tomato quality. Knowing that UV-B is a powerful elicitor of secondary metabolism and not transmitted through greenhouse glass and some greenhouse plastics, we tested the hypothesis that supplemental UV-B radiation in the greenhouse will impart quality attributes typically associated with garden-grown tomatoes. Environmentally relevant doses of supplemental UV-B radiation did not strongly affect antioxidant compounds of fruits, although the flavonol quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin) significantly increased in response to UV-B. Physicochemical metrics of fruit quality attributes and consumer sensory panels were used to determine if any such differences altered consumer perception of tomato quality. Supplemental UV-A radiation (315-400 nm) pre-harvest treatments enhanced sensory perception of aroma, acidity, and overall approval, suggesting a compelling opportunity to environmentally enhance the flavor of greenhouse-grown tomatoes. The expression of the genes COP1 and HY5 were indicative of adaptation to UV radiation, which explains the lack of marked effects reported in these studies. To our knowledge, these studies represent the first reported use of environmentally relevant doses of UV radiation throughout the reproductive portion of the tomato plant life cycle to positively enhance the sensory and chemical properties of fruits.

27478901,"Soil contains various essential and nonessential elements, all of which can be absorbed by plants. Plant ionomics is the study of the accumulation of these elements (the ionome) in plants. The ionomic profile of a plant is affected by various factors, including species, variety, organ, and environment. In this study, we cultivated various vegetable crop species and cultivars under the same field conditions and analyzed the level of accumulation of each element in the edible and nonedible parts using ionomic techniques. The concentration of each element in the edible parts differed between species, which could be partly explained by differences in the types of edible organs (root, leaf, seed, and fruit). For example, the calcium concentration was lower in seeds and fruit than in other organs because of the higher dependency of calcium accumulation on xylem transfer. The concentration of several essential microelements and nonessential elements in the edible parts also varied greatly between cultivars of the same species, knowledge of which will help in the breeding of vegetables that are biofortified or contain lower concentrations of toxic elements. Comparison of the ionomes of the fruit and leaves of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and eggplant (S. melongena) indicated that cadmium and boron had higher levels of accumulation in eggplant fruit, likely because of their effective transport in the phloem. We also found that homologous elements that have been reported to share the same uptake/transport system often showed significant correlation only in a few families and that the slopes of these relationships differed between families. Therefore, these differences in the characteristics of mineral accumulation are likely to affect the ionomic profiles of different families.

The procedure involved extraction of the rodenticides from samples with acetone, followed by liquid-liquid partitioning with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and 10% sodium chloride aqueous solution, then cleanup using GPC, and finally, analysis using LC-MS/MS. High recoveries from the GPC column were obtained for all rodenticides tested using a mobile phase of acetone/cyclohexane/triethylamine (400:1600:1, v/v/v). An ODS column, which contains low levels of metal impurities, gave satisfactory peak shapes for both hydroxycoumarin- and indandione-type rodenticides in the LC-MS/MS separation. The average recoveries of rodenticides from eight agricultural foods (apple, eggplant, cabbage, orange, potato, tomato, brown rice, and soybean) fortified at 0.0005-0.001 mg/kg ranged from 76 to 116%, except for bromadiolone in orange (53%) and diphacinone in soybean (54%), and the relative standard deviations ranged from 1 to 16%.

Several types of HPLC columns were tested for the liquid chromatographic separation of the toxins of interest that widely differ in their polarities. The focus was on gaining suitable retention while avoiding derivatization steps especially for TeA and AA-III. Three atmospheric pressure ionization techniques used with liquid chromatography (electrospray, chemical and photo ionization) were tested to obtain the best selectivity and sensitivity. Samples were diluted with sodium hydrogen carbonate buffer and extracted on a diatomaceous earth solid phase extraction cartridge. Method validation was carried out by using tomato juice, citrus juice and white wine as blank matrices. Limits of detection ranged from 0.10 to 0.59μgL(-1) and limits of quantification ranged from 0.4-3.1μgL(-1) depending on the toxin and matrix.

27142444,"Solanum diploconos is an unexploited Brazilian native fruit that belongs to the same genus of important food crops, such as tomato (Solanum lycorpersicum) and potato (Solanum tuberosum). In this study, we determined, for the first time, the profile of bioactive compounds (phenolic compounds, carotenoids, ascorbic acid and tocopherols) of the freeze-dried pulp and peel of Solanum diploconos fruits, as well as of an extract obtained from the whole fruit. Additionally, the antioxidant potential of the whole fruit extract was evaluated in vitro, against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Eighteen phenolic compounds were identified in the peel and pulp and 6 compounds were found in the whole fruit extract. Coumaric, ferulic and caffeic acid derivatives were revealed to be the major phenolic constituents. All-trans-β-carotene was the major carotenoid (17-38 μg g(-1), dry basis), but all-trans-lutein and 9-cis-β-carotene were also identified. The peel and pulp presented <2 μg per mL of tocopherols, and ascorbic acid was not detected. The whole fruit extract exhibited scavenging capacity against all tested ROS and RNS (IC50 = 14-461 μg mL(-1)) with high antioxidant efficiency against HOCl. Thus, Solanum diploconos fruits may be seen as a promising source of bioactive compounds with high antioxidant potential against the most physiologically relevant ROS and RNS.

The quantification step has been performed using the primary line (228.802nm) for cadmium and the adjacent secondary lines (228.725nm and 228.668nm) for iron and tin, respectively. The selected chemical modifier was an acid solution that contained a mixture of 0.1% (w/v) Pd and 0.05% (w/v) Mg. The absorbance signals were measured based on the peak area using 3 pixels for cadmium and 5 pixels for iron and tin. Under these conditions, cadmium, iron and tin have been determined in canned-food samples using the external calibration technique based on aqueous standards, where the limits of quantification were 2.10ngg(-1) for cadmium, 1.95mgkg(-1) for iron and 3.00mgkg(-1) for tin, and the characteristic masses were 1.0pg for cadmium, 0.9ng for iron and 1.1ng for tin. The precision was evaluated using two solutions of each metal ion, and the results, which were expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD%), were 3.4-6.8%. The method accuracy for cadmium and iron was confirmed by analyzing a certified reference material of apple leaves (NIST 1515), which was supplied by NIST.

Thus, understanding their uptake, transportation, and transformation in plants, especially food crops, is critical because it represents a potential pathway for human consumption. One of the primary challenges for the endeavor is the inadequacy of current analytical methodologies to characterize and quantify the nanomaterial in complex biological samples at environmentally relevant concentrations. Herein, a method was developed using single particle-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS) technology to simultaneously detect the size and size distribution of particulate Ce, particle concentration, and dissolved cerium in the shoots of four plant species including cucumber, tomato, soybean, and pumpkin. An enzymatic digestion method with Macerozyme R-10 enzyme previously used for gold nanoparticle extraction from the tomato plant was adapted successfully for CeO2NP extraction from all four plant species. This study is the first to report and demonstrate the presence of dissolved cerium in plant seedling shoots exposed to CeO2NPs hydroponically.

27129773,"The green odor of plants is characterized by green leaf volatiles (GLVs) composed of C6 compounds. GLVs are biosynthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acids in thylakoid membranes by a series of enzymes. A representative member of GLVs (E)-2-hexenal, known as the leaf aldehyde, has been assumed to be produced by isomerization from (Z)-3-hexenal in the biosynthesis pathway; however, the enzyme has not yet been identified. In this study, we purified the (Z)-3:(E)-2-hexenal isomerase (HI) from paprika fruits and showed that various plant species have homologous HIs. Purified HI is a homotrimeric protein of 110 kDa composed of 35-kDa subunits and shows high activity at acidic and neutral pH values. Phylogenetic analysis showed that HIs belong to the cupin superfamily, and at least three catalytic amino acids (His, Lys, Tyr) are conserved in HIs of various plant species. Enzymatic isomerization of (Z)-3-hexenal in the presence of deuterium oxide resulted in the introduction of deuterium at the C4 position of (E)-2-hexenal, and a suicide substrate 3-hexyn-1-al inhibited HI irreversibly, suggesting that the catalytic mode of HI is a keto-enol tautomerism reaction mode mediated by a catalytic His residue. The gene expression of HIs in Solanaceae plants was enhanced in specific developmental stages and by wounding treatment.

Pb content in mango was found to be six times higher than the safe limit at production level. Health risks associated with the intake of these metals were evaluated in terms of estimated daily intake (EDI), and carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks by target hazard quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI). EDI values of all the metals were found to be below the maximum tolerable daily intake (MTDI). The THQs of all metals were <1, suggesting no health hazards for adult population. However, total THQs of Mn and Cu were >1 through consumption of all vegetables, indicating significant health risks. HI was found to be <1 (0.825) for consumption of fruits; however, it was >1 (3.727) for vegetable consumption, suggesting adverse health effects from vegetable consumption only.

To bridge the knowledge gap, the current study was initiated to investigate the stereoselective degradation of sulfoxaflor in solar greenhouse cucumber and tomato from foliage and root uptake pathways. The stereoselective dissipation of sulfoxaflor was not statistically different between enantiomer pairs from foliage and root pathways of vegetables (P < 0.05).

Nevertheless, the concentrations of (+)-sulfoxaflor A and (-)-sulfoxaflor B were both slightly higher than that of their antipode.

We modified the widely used Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe (QuEChERS) method to measure several current-use pyrethroids (cis/trans-permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and cyhalothrin) and their environmental degradation products (3-PBA, cis/trans-DCCA, 4-F-3-PBA, DBCA, and MPA) in selected fresh fruits and vegetables. Using fortified samples, we determined extraction efficiencies from: tomatoes, oranges (whole, peeled, and rind), grapes, apples, bananas (peeled and rind only), onions, lettuce, green peppers, carrots and broccoli. For a subset of these food items (apples, grapes, tomatoes, lettuce and banana peel), we also established limits of detection (MDLs) and quantitation (MQLs).

When applied to real samples, RB was detected in several positive samples (chili powders) within the range from 0.042 to 0.177mgkg(-1).

26822807,"Recently, a new assay method that can quantify the singlet oxygen absorption capacity (SOAC) of natural antioxidants and food extracts was developed. The SOAC values were measured in ethanol-chloroform-D2O (50 + 50 + 1, v/v/v) solution at 35°C using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with a six-channel cell positioner and an electron-temperature control unit. In the present study, measurement of the SOAC values was performed for eight representative carotenoids and three vegetable extracts (tomato, carrot, and red paprika) using a versatile instrument, the microplate reader. A 24-well glass microplate was used for measurements because a plastic microplate, commonly used in the laboratory, dissolves in the ethanol-chloroform-D2O solution. The SOAC values of eight carotenoids and three vegetable extracts measured using a microplate reader were in good agreement with the corresponding values measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, suggesting that the microplate reader is an applicable instrument for the measurement of reliable SOAC values for general antioxidants and food extracts in solution.

26726936,"A simple and rapid extraction procedure for the simultaneous determination of eight mycotoxins (Alternaria toxins, ochratoxin A, patulin, citrinin) in a variety of fruit matrices has been developed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The procedure involves a one-step cleanup using homemade solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. By comparative evaluation among six various adsorbents (C18, PSA, HLB, MCX, Silica, NH2), the combination of MCX and NH2 was found to provide the most effective cleanup, removing the greatest number of matrix interferences and also allowing the quantification of all analyzed mycotoxins in fruits. The optimized extraction conditions including acidified aqueous acetonitrile and an additional salt-out step using NaCl were employed before SPE cleanup. Method validation was performed by analyzing samples spiked at three levels (LOQ, 2 LOQ and 10 LOQ). Four fruits including apple, sweet cherry, tomato and orange fruits were selected, and accuracy (recovery%), precision (RSD%), limits of quantification (LOQ), linearity and matrix effect were evaluated during validation. Matrix-matched linearity with correlation coefficients ≥ 0.9921 was established in the range of 5-200 ng mL(-1) for patulin and 1-200 ng mL(-1) for other mycotoxins, respectively. Recoveries between 74.2% and 102.4% and relative standard deviations lower than 4.7% were obtained for all tested fruits. The matrix effect observed was low (≤ ± 17%) in all three fruit matrixes with the exception of orange, for which strong ion suppression was observed for alternariol (25.3%), ochratoxin A (31.6%) and citrinin (40.3%). Therefore, matrix-matched calibration was used for a correct quantification in order to compensate for matrix effect. The limits of quantification (LOQ), ranging from 1 to 5 μg kg(-1) depending on mycotoxins type, were always lower than maximum permitted levels for every regulated mycotoxin by the current European legislation.",Journal of chromatography.

26703808,"Plant NAD(+)-dependent aminoaldehyde dehydrogenases (AMADHs, EC 1.2.1.19) belong to the family 10 of aldehyde dehydrogenases. They participate in the metabolism of polyamines or osmoprotectants. The enzymes are characterized by their broad substrate specificity covering ω-aminoaldehydes, aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes as well as nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aldehydes. The isoenzyme 1 from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum; SlAMADH1) oxidizes aliphatic aldehydes very efficiently and converts also furfural, its derivatives or benzaldehyde, which are present at low concentrations in alcoholic distillates such as fruit brandy. In this work, SlAMADH1 was examined as a bioanalytical tool for their detection. These aldehydes arise from fermentation processes or thermal degradation of sugars and their presence is related to health complications after consumption including nausea, emesis, sweating, decrease in blood pressure, hangover headache, among others. Sixteen samples of slivovitz (plum brandy) from local producers in Moravia, Czech Republic, were analyzed for their aldehyde content using a spectrophotometric activity assay with SlAMADH1. In all cases, there were oxidative responses observed when monitoring NADH production in the enzymatic reaction. Aldehydes in the distillate samples were also subjected to a standard determination using reversed-phase HPLC with spectrophotometric and tandem mass spectrometric detection after a derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Results obtained by both methods were found to correlate well for a majority of the analyzed samples.

In order to lead the synthesis of recognition materials, four original AOH surrogates have been designed, prepared and characterized. They bear different number of phenol groups in various positions and different degree of O-methylation on the dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one skeleton. A comprehensive library of mixtures of basic, acidic or neutral monomers, with divinylbenzene or ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate as cross-linkers, were polymerized at a small scale in the presence of the four molecular mimics of the toxin molecule. This polymer screening has allowed selection of the optimal composition of the microbeads (N-(2-aminoethyl)methacrylamide, EAMA, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate). The latter are able to bind AOH in water-acetonitrile (80:20, v/v) with an affinity constant of 109±10mM(-1) and a total number of binding sites of 35±2μmolg(-1), being alternariol monomethylether the only competitor species. Moreover, (1)H NMR titrations have unveiled a 1:2 surrogate-to-EAMA stoichiometry, the exact interaction sites and a binding constant of 1.5×10(4)M(-2).

26524547,"Pathogen-derived, small secreted cysteine-rich proteins (SSCPs) are known to be a common source of fungal effectors that trigger resistance or susceptibility in specific host plants. This group of proteins has not been well studied in Fusarium graminearum, the primary cause of Fusarium head blight (FHB), a devastating disease of wheat. We report here a comprehensive analysis of SSCPs encoded in the genome of this fungus and selection of candidate effector proteins through proteomics and sequence/transcriptional analyses. A total of 190 SSCPs were identified in the genome of F. graminearum (isolate PH-1) based on the presence of N-terminal signal peptide sequences, size (≤200 amino acids), and cysteine content (≥2%) of the mature proteins. Twenty-five (approximately 13%) SSCPs were confirmed to be true extracellular proteins by nanoscale liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis of a minimal medium-based in vitro secretome. Sequence analysis suggested that 17 SSCPs harbor conserved functional domains, including two homologous to Ecp2, a known effector produced by the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum. Transcriptional analysis revealed that at least 34 SSCPs (including 23 detected in the in vitro secretome) are expressed in infected wheat heads; about half are up-regulated with expression patterns correlating with the development of FHB. This work provides a solid candidate list for SSCP-derived effectors that may play roles in mediating F. graminearum-wheat interactions.

Their persistence both in the irrigation water and in the soil can lead to their transfer and bioaccumulation into agricultural plants.

The plant was exposed to either Microcystis aeruginosa crude extracts containing up to 100 μg eq.MC-LRL(-1) in a soil-plant system for 90 days or pure radiolabeled (14)C-MC-LR in a hydroponic condition for 48 h. Toxin bioaccumulation in the soil and different plant tissues was assessed both by the PP2A inhibition assay and by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). After 90 days of exposure, microcystins persisted in the soil and their free extractable concentrations accumulated were very low varying between 1.6 and 3.9 μg eq.MC-LR kg(-1) DW. Free MC-LR was detected only in roots and leaves with concentrations varying between 4.5 and 8.1 μg kg(-1) DW and between 0.29 and 0.55 μg kg(-1) DW, respectively.

In combination with an analysis time per sample of 12 min, the sample preparation is cost-effective and easy to handle. The method covers alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), tenuazonic acid (TeA), altenuene (ALT), iso-altenuene (isoALT), tentoxin (TEN), altertoxin-I (ATX-I), and the AAL toxins TA1 and TA2. Some Alternaria toxins which are either not commercially available or very expensive, namely AOH, AME, ALT, isoALT, and ATX-I, were isolated as reference compounds from fungal cultures. The method was extensively validated for tomato products, bakery products, sunflower seeds, fruit juices, and vegetable oils. AOH, AME, TeA, and TEN were found in quantifiable amounts and 92.1% of all analyzed samples (n = 96) showed low level contamination with one or more Alternaria toxins.

26212568,"Alternaria toxins and citrinin are mycotoxins produced by fungi growing on different raw materials and agricultural commodities. Maximum levels of these toxins in foods are currently under consideration by the European Commission as a risk management measure. In this study, a new quantitative method is described for the determination of five Alternaria toxins and citrinin in tomato and tomato juice samples based on LC-MS/MS detection. Samples were extracted with pure methanol, followed by a derivatisation step with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to improve the determination of tenuazonic acid and to decrease the wide polarity difference between the compounds of interest. Samples were purified on hydrophilic-modified styrene polymer solid-phase extraction cartridges. High-performance liquid chromatographic columns packed with different core-shell materials were tested for the separation of toxins and a C-18 phase was in the final method applied to achieve sufficient separation of all relevant analytes. A key element of this approach was to prove successful transferability of the method to three different triple quadrupole mass spectrometers. A full single laboratory method validation was performed on two LC-MS/MS systems and performance characteristics met the predefined requirements. Moreover, the method was used in an international proficiency test and the satisfactory z-scores obtained (-0.1 to 0.8 in tomato juice samples) demonstrated the reliability of the approach described. The method will be validated in an inter-laboratory collaborative study and if the criteria for method precision are met, the method will be proposed as a new Work Item to the European Committee for Standardisation.

For the latter, a mixing vessel with stator-rotor-system proved to be advantageous. The extraction procedure of dried fruits is much easier and safer than the Ultra Turrax and results in excellent validation data at a concentration level of 0.01mg/kg (116 of 118 analytes with recoveries in the range of 70-120%, 117 of 118 analytes with RSD <20%). After qualifying problematic lipophilic pesticides in fat-rich cereals (fat content >7%), predominantly organochlorines showed recoveries of <70% in quantification when the standard QuEChERS method with water was used. A second extraction was carried out analogous to the QuEChERS method, however, without the addition of water. With this simple modification, the problematic lipophilic pesticides, which had been strongly affected by the fat content of the commodities, could be determined with recoveries above 70% even at a concentration level of 0.01mg/kg. Moreover, a GC-MS/MS screening method for 120 pesticides at a concentration level of 0.01mg/kg was established by employing analyte protectants (ethylglycerol, gulonolactone, and sorbitol). The use of only one standardized calibration, made of an apple purée extract in combination with analyte protectants, allowed for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 120 pesticides in different matrix extracts (tomato, red pepper, sour cherries, dried apples, black currant powder, raisins, wheat flour, rolled oats, wheat germ).

The results showed that 270 (67.5%) of all samples contained benzoate ranging from 11.9 to 288.5 mg kg(-1) in lactic cheese and fruit juice, respectively. The levels of sorbate in 98 (24.5%) of the samples were 20.1 to 284.3 mg kg(-1) in doogh and fruit juice, respectively. Moreover, benzoate was detected in all dairy products ranging from 11.9 mg kg(-1) in lactic cheese to 91.2 mg kg(-1) in UF-Feta cheese. A low concentration of benzoate could originate naturally, due to specific biochemical mechanisms during cheese, yogurt and doogh maturation.

The method was validated for the following representative matrices: radish (tuber), tomato (eggplant fruit), cabbage (leafy), cowpea (bean), cucumber (melon) and so on. Samples were extracted with hexane-ethyl acetate (1:2, v/v), and then detected by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometry after being cleaned up with dispersive-solid phase purification procedure. Significant matrix effects were compensated by using the matrix-matched calibration curves. 18 preservatives showed good linearity over the range of 5.0-100.0 μg/L with correlation coefficients of 0.9904-1.000. The limits of detections were in the range of 0.04-4.16 μg/kg and the limits of quantity were in the range of 0.13-13.85 μg/kg. The recoveries of 18 preservatives ranged from 76.0% to 120.0% with the spiked levels of 2, 4 and 10 μg/kg into homogenized vegetables, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 0.3% to 14.8%.

With the aim to investigate the contribution of 7k-LTPs to the food allergies, we have identified, isolated and characterised a tomato seed 7k-LTP (Sola l 7k-LTP). The protein was purified by chromatographic separations, identified by direct protein sequencing and mass spectrometry and a molecular model was built. Functional evaluation of the allergen has been performed by skin testing. Sola l 7k-LTP consists of 68 amino acids producing a molecular mass of 7045Da and displays 41% sequence identity with Pru p 3, the allergenic 9k-LTP from peach. IgE antibodies specifically recognising Sola l 7k-LTP were found within the population claiming tomato ingestion-related symptoms, but also in subjects tolerant on tomato exposure. A few subjects were mono-sensitised to Sola l 7k-LTP, which is biologically active as shown by the positive skin test. In line with the immunological results, the molecular model shows structural similarities between the IgE binding regions of the two sub-families. Therefore, Sola l 7k-LTP shares some structural and immunological features with Pru p 3, but it also displays individual features that could be responsible for mono-specific IgE binding. In conclusion, Sola l 7k-LTP is a new identified allergenic LTP, the description of which may contribute to the improvement of allergy diagnosis and to the formulation of a safe and personalised diet. In addition, to avoid current confusing classifications, a new nomenclature policy for LTP sub-families is proposed in this paper. We now suggest that 7-kDa LTP (so far named LTP2) be renamed 7k-LTP and 9-kDa LTP (so far named LTP1) be renamed 9k-LTP.

In order to corroborate the fragmentation routes observed on XylGos, some commercial galacto-manno-oligosaccharides (GalMOs) and glucurono-xylo-oligosaccharides were also studied. The fragmentation pathways of the ionized GalMos were similar to those of XylGos ones. The product ion spectra were mainly characterized by prominent double cleavage (D) ions corresponding to the entire inner side chains. The directed fragmentation from the reducing end to the other end was observed for the main glycosylated backbone but also for the side-chains, allowing their complete sequencing. Relevant cross-ring cleavage ions from (0,2)X(j)-type revealed to be diagnostic of the 1-2-linked- glycosyl units from XylGos together with the 1-2-linked glucuronic acid unit from glucuronoxylans. Resonant activation in the LTQ Orbitrap allowed not only determining the type of all linkages but also the O-acetyl group location on fucosylated side-chains. Moreover, the fragmentation of the different side chains using the MS(n) capabilities of the LTQ/Orbitrap analyzer also allowed differentiating terminal arabinosyl and xylosyl substituents inside S and U side-chains of XylGos, respectively. The CID spectra obtained were very informative for distinction of isomeric structures differing only in their substitution pattern.

The levels of HCAs DMIP, MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, PhIP, harman and norharman were found to be between 0.93 and 27.52 ng g(-1), whereas IQ, MeIQ, AαC, MeAαC, Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were found either below the limit of quantification or not detected in the control sample. Nevertheless, for samples cooked using food condiments, the amounts of HCAs (DMIP, MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx and PhIP) were between 0.14 and 19.57 ng g(-1); harman and norharman were detected at higher concentrations up to 17.77 ng g(-1) while IQ and MeIQ were at levels below the limit of quantification; and AαC, MeAαC, Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were not detected in any of the samples. The outcomes revealed that the formation of HCAs (except harman and norharman) diminished after the addition of food condiments.

25495653,"This manuscript reports a new pesticide residue analysis method employing a microflow-liquid chromatography system coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (microflow-LC-ESI-QqQ-MS). This uses an electrospray ionization source with a narrow tip emitter to generate smaller droplets. A validation study was undertaken to establish performance characteristics for this new approach on 90 pesticide residues, including their degradation products, in three commodities (tomato, pepper, and orange). The significant benefits of the microflow-LC-MS/MS-based method were a high sensitivity gain and a notable reduction in matrix effects delivered by a dilution of the sample (up to 30-fold); this is as a result of competition reduction between the matrix compounds and analytes for charge during ionization. Overall robustness and a capability to withstand long analytical runs using the microflow-LC-MS system have been demonstrated (for 100 consecutive injections without any maintenance being required). Quality controls based on the results of internal standards added at the samples' extraction, dilution, and injection steps were also satisfactory. The LOQ values were mostly 5 μg kg(-1) for almost all pesticide residues. Other benefits were a substantial reduction in solvent usage and waste disposal as well as a decrease in the run-time.

With acetonitrile as the extraction solvent, the samples were pretreated with the improved QuEChERS method including extraction, salting-out and purification processes. Then all the sample extracts were analyzed with GC-MS in selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode, and quantified by matrix-matched standard solution in external standard method. Under electron ionization conditions, the analysis was carried out with a capillary column (DB-5 MS, 30 mx 0. 25 mm x 0. 25 μm) at a flow rate of 1. 1 mL/min. The quantitation was performed to detect ions of m/z 285, 371, 165 for flumorph and m/z 301, 387, 165 for dimethomorph. Good linearity was obtained in the range of 10-1 000 μg/kg for both pesticides with correlation coefficients greater than 0. 999. The recovery experiments were carried out by spiking blank samples of ginger, tomato, carrot, spinach, cabbage and tremella at the three levels of 10, 20 and 100 μg/kg.

An initial exploratory experiment indicated that the order of blending and thermal treatments had the highest impact on the phytochemicals in the purees. This blending-heating order effect was investigated in more depth by performing alternate blending-heating sequences in triplicate on the same batches of broccoli, tomato and carrot.

BIR showed higher decay rates of these pesticides during the whole trial, nevertheless residue averages remained higher than TOM reaching the time of harvest. Residues at the PHI were all below their Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs), but data indicated that they could exceed their legal limits especially if the above-mentioned active ingredients were employed more than once per crop cycle on cherry type tomatoes.

24828980,"An atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source has been used to enhance the potential of gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry (MS) for screening and quantification purposes in pesticide residue analysis. A screening method developed in our laboratory for around 130 pesticides has been applied to fruit and vegetable samples, including strawberries, oranges, apples, carrots, lettuces, courgettes, red peppers, and tomatoes. Samples were analyzed together with quality control samples (at 0.05 mg/kg) for each matrix and for matrix-matched calibration standards. The screening strategy consisted in first rapid searching and detection, and then a refined identification step using the QTOF capabilities (MS(E) and accurate mass). Identification was based on the presence of one characteristic m/z ion (Q) obtained with the low collision energy function and at least one fragment ion (q) obtained with the high collision energy function, both with mass errors of less than 5 ppm, and an ion intensity ratio (q/Q) within the tolerances permitted. Following this strategy, 15 of 130 pesticides were identified in the samples. Afterwards, the quantitation capabilities were tested by performing a quantitative validation for those pesticides detected in the samples. To this aim, five matrices were selected (orange, apple, tomato, lettuce, and carrot) and spiked at two concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg), and quantification was done using matrix-matched calibration standards (relative responses versus triphenyl phosphate used as an internal standard). Acceptable average recoveries and relative standard deviations were obtained for many but not all pesticide-matrix combinations. These figures allowed us to perform a retrospective quantification of positives found in the screening without the need for additional analysis. Taking advantage of the accurate-mass full-spectrum data provided by QTOF MS, we searched for a higher number of compounds (up to 416 pesticides) in a second stage by performing extra data processing without any new sample injection. Several more pesticides were detected, confirmed, and/or tentatively identified when the reference standard was unavailable, illustrating in this way the potential of gas chromatography-QTOF MS to detect pesticides in addition to the ones targeted in quantitative analysis of pesticides in food matrices.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D001274', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D010573', 'D014675']","['Atmospheric Pressure', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Vegetables']",Screening and quantification of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables making use of gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828980,2015

Ergosterol analysis was done by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Tomato paste samples were packaged in either aseptic bags or tin boxes and stored at 4, 20, 28, or 37°C for a period of 10 months. The detection limit of ergosterol was 0.1 mg/kg. Measurements showed that packaging and storage temperatures of 28 and 37°C have a considerable influence on ergosterol and HMC changes in the product. The poor precision of the ""percentage of discarded fruits"" and HMC methods has increased the importance of ergosterol for the microbiological quality evaluation of tomato and tomato products.

The suitability of the two versions of QuEChERS method for sample preparation was evaluated for the extraction of 51 carbamate pesticides in the six vegetables. One of the QuEChERS methods was the original un-buffered method published in 2003, and the other was AOAC Official Method 2007.01 using acetate buffer. As a result, the best effects were obtained from using the combination of C18 and PSA for extract cleanup in vegetables. The acetate-buffered version was suitable for the determination of all pesticides except dioxacarb. Un-buffered QuEChERS method gave satisfactory results for determining dioxacarb. Based on these results, the suitable QuEChERS sample preparation method and liquid chromatography-positive electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry under the optimized conditions were applied to determine the 51 carbamate pesticide residues in six vegetables.

Here, we examined the relationship between toxin production and the pathogenicity of Vmm strains and determined their bioactivities in several assays, for further elucidating the pathogenesis mechanisms of Vmm and for developing new procedures to control this disease. The toxins were quantified with the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, and the results showed that the strain with attenuated virulence produced low levels of toxins with only three to four kinds of compounds being detectable. In contrast, higher amounts of toxins were produced by the more aggressive strain, and all five compounds were detected. This indicated a significant correlation between the pathogenicity of Vmm strains and their ability to produce toxins. However, this correlation only existed in planta, but not in vitro. During the infection of Vmm, protocatechuic acid was first detected at three days post inoculation (dpi), and the others at seven or 11 dpi.

The main degradation observed was the oxidation of quercetin, since the hydroxy-function at the C-ring of this flavonoid is not blocked by a sugar moiety, unlike rutin.

24645516,"Functional and quantitative evaluation of analytes in crude extracts or semipure mixtures has been considered challenging due to variation in generated results. Some of the drawbacks have been linked to the texture, form, and content of the samples. The crude extracts contain multiple components and, in oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays, have exhibited complex reaction kinetics due to interference or matrix effect. The conventional ORAC assay utilized a single dilution factor that brought about a wide CV difference (60-110%) in antioxidant activity for each extract compared to other dilution factors applied. Due to precision errors introduced from these extremely high CV% differences, determination of antioxidant capacity based on a single dilution may introduce discrepant results. A novel standardized ORAC (SORAC) assay for the determination of antioxidant capacity of dietary plant extracts is described in this study. Using the SORAC assay, positive linear correlations (R2 = 0.95-0.99) were obtained for the sample extracts tested when a multiple dilution strategy was applied. Thus, on the strength of our observations, SORAC has been proposed as an effective tool for assessing antioxidant analytes in a biological matrix.

The determination of the target compounds was achieved within a 5.1min run time by using an UPLC HSS T3 column connected to an electrospray ionization source (ESI, positive ion mode) for oxathiapiprolin and the negative mode for the two metabolites. The method showed excellent linearity (R(2)>0.9904) for target compounds. The limit of detection (LOD) for the three compounds ranged from 0.5μgkg(-1) to 7.5μgkg(-1) and the limits of quantitation (LOQ) were 1μgkg(-1) and 10μgkg(-1) for oxathiapiprolin and the metabolites, respectively. The mean recoveries from seven matrices ranged from 81.5 to 110.7%, with intra-day relative standard deviations (RSDr) in the range of 0.8-12.0% for all three test compounds. The inter-day RSDR were less than 14.5% for all of the recovery tests. The method was successfully applied for simultaneous analysis of oxathiapiprolin and its metabolites in actual trial samples, indicating its effectiveness in investigating oxathiapiprolin and its metabolites in the food.

24418711,"A reproducible method for monitoring traces of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors in acetonitrile extracts from fruits and vegetables is described. The method is based on hypochlorite oxidation and ChE inhibition assay. Four common representative samples of produce were selected from a supermarket to investigate the effect of different matrices on pesticides recoveries and assay precision. The samples were extracted with acetonitrile to prepare them for ChE inhibition assays: if necessary, clean-up was performed using dispersive solid-phase extraction for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses. Chlorine was tested as an oxidising reagent for the conversion of thiophosphorus pesticides (P=S compounds) into their P=O analogues, which have high ChE-inhibiting activity. Chlorine consumption of individual acetonitrile extracts was determined and was strongly dependent on the individual types of fruits and vegetables. After treating the acetonitrile extracts with an excess hypochlorite at 25°C for 15 min, the ChE-inhibiting activities and detection limits for each chlorine-treated pesticide solution were determined. Matrix composition did not interfere significantly with the determination of the pesticides. Enhanced anti-ChE activities leading to low detection limits (ppb levels) were observed for the chlorine-treated extracts that were spiked with chlorpyrifos, diazinon, fenitrothion, and isoxathion. This combination of oxidative derivatisation and ChE inhibition assays was used successfully to monitor and perform semi-quantitative determination of ChE inhibitors in apple, tomato, cucumber, and strawberry samples.

24286212,"Formation of galactose-acylated monogalactosyldiacylglycerols has been shown to be induced by leaf homogenization, mechanical wounding, avirulent bacterial infection and thawing after snap-freezing. Here, lipidomic analysis using mass spectrometry showed that galactose-acylated monogalactosyldiacylglycerols, formed in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaves upon wounding, have acyl-galactose profiles that differ from those of wounded Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating that different plant species accumulate different acyl-galactose components in response to the same stress. Additionally, the composition of the acyl-galactose component of Arabidopsis acMGDG (galactose-acylated monogalactosyldiacylglycerol) depends on the stress treatment. After sub-lethal freezing treatment, acMGDG contained mainly non-oxidized fatty acids esterified to galactose, whereas mostly oxidized fatty acids accumulated on galactose after wounding or bacterial infection. Compositional data are consistent with acMGDG being formed in vivo by transacylation with fatty acids from digalactosyldiacylglycerols. Oxophytodienoic acid, an oxidized fatty acid, was more concentrated on the galactosyl ring of acylated monogalactosyldiacylglycerols than in galactolipids in general. Also, oxidized fatty acid-containing acylated monogalactosyldiacylglycerols increased cumulatively when wounded Arabidopsis leaves were wounded again. These findings suggest that, in Arabidopsis, the pool of galactose-acylated monogalactosyldiacylglycerols may serve to sequester oxidized fatty acids during stress responses.

This paper aims to evaluate the combination of enhanced mass resolution and concurrent selectivity and sensitivity in analyzing a complex mixture of 341 pesticides in grape, orange, tomato, okra and spinach by gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Timed-selective reaction monitoring (t-SRM) was found advantageous over segment SRM in terms of ease of method optimization and sensitivity. The optimized t-SRM method was used to test the applicability of ultra-SRM (USRM) in filtering out co-eluting interfering matrix compounds. False detections of benfluralin, dimethoate, etc. could be avoided when mass resolution was increased from 0.7 to 0.4 and 0.2Da (full width at half maximum). Similar observations were noted for chlorobenzilate, spiromesifen, tebuconazole, etc., in grape; omethoate, bendiocarb, monocrotophos, etc. in orange; omethoate, dimethoate, ethoxyquin, atrazine, etc., in tomato; and dichlobenil, omethoate, propoxur, monocrotophos, etc., in okra. The analysis at higher mass resolution could significantly minimize matrix effects (ME), e.g., 34% at 0.7Da for spiroxamine in grape to 0.6% (0.4Da) and -44% (0.7Da) for dichlorvos in okra to 8.8% (0.1Da).

23973661,"In order to broaden the available genetic variation of melon, we developed an ethyl methanesulfonate mutation library in an orange-flesh 'Charentais' type melon line that accumulates β-carotene. One mutagenized M2 family segregated for a novel recessive trait, a yellow-orange fruit flesh ('yofI'). HPLC analysis revealed that 'yofI' accumulates pro-lycopene (tetra-cis-lycopene) as its major fruit pigment. The altered carotenoid composition of 'yofI' is associated with a significant change of the fruit aroma since cleavage of β-carotene yields different apocarotenoids than the cleavage of pro-lycopene. Normally, pro-lycopene is further isomerized by CRTISO (carotenoid isomerase) to yield all-trans-lycopene, which is further cyclized to β-carotene in melon fruit. Cloning and sequencing of 'yofI' CRTISO identified two mRNA sequences which lead to truncated forms of CRTISO. Sequencing of the genomic CRTISO identified an A-T transversion in 'yofI' which leads to a premature STOP codon. The early carotenoid pathway genes were up regulated in yofI fruit causing accumulation of other intermediates such as phytoene and ζ-carotene. Total carotenoid levels are only slightly increased in the mutant. Mutants accumulating pro-lycopene have been reported in both tomato and watermelon fruits, however, this is the first report of a non-lycopene accumulating fruit showing this phenomenon.",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,"['D053898', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D028463', 'D005020', 'D000077276', 'D016296', 'D019207', 'D019745']","['Biosynthetic Pathways', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cucumis melo', 'Ethyl Methanesulfonate', 'Lycopene', 'Mutagenesis', 'beta Carotene', 'cis-trans-Isomerases']",Genetic and chemical characterization of an EMS induced mutation in Cucumis melo CRTISO gene.,"['Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['genetics', 'genetics', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23973661,2014

The uptake of cadmium and its accumulation by plants is dependent on various soil, plants and environmental factors. In order to identify soil properties with statistically significant influence on cadmium concentration in vegetables and to reduce the collection of data, time and costs, regression models can be applied. The main objective of this research was to develop regression models to predict the concentration of cadmium in 9-vegetable species: zucchini, tomato, cabbage, onion, potato, carrot, red beet, endive and chicory, based on soil properties. Soil samples were collected from 123 home gardens of the Municipality of Celje and 59 of these gardens were also included in vegetable sampling. The concentration of elements (e.g. arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc) in the samples was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Single (for cabbage, potato, red beet and chicory) and multiple (for tomato, onion, carrot and endive) linear regression models were developed. There was no statistically significant regression model for zucchini. The most significant parameter for the influencing the cadmium concentration in vegetables was the concentration of cadmium in soil. Other important soil properties were the content of organic matter, pH-value and the concentration of manganese.

After infestation of chewing insect, Peroxidase activity in the sap and TSP of all the studied plants were enhanced in the range of 1.6 to 3.14 fold. Similar observations were also obtained with feeding of sap sucking insects, in which increment in peroxidase activity of sap and TSP was in the range of 1.8 to 2.53 fold.

In this study, a sensitive and convenient chiral liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for simultaneous measurement of the enantiomers of metalaxyl and its major metabolite, metalaxyl acid, in tomato and cucumber. Separation was by reversed-phase chromatography on a Chiralcel OD-RH column under isocratic conditions using acetonitrile-water (60/40, v/v) as mobile phase. The proposed method was successfully applied to investigate the possible enantioselective transformation of metalaxyl as well as the formation of metalaxyl acid in tomato and cucumber. In both vegetables, the (-)-R-enantiomer was preferentially degraded, resulting in relative enrichment of the (+)-S-enantiomer. Furthermore, formation of the metalaxyl acid enantiomers was also shown to be enantioselective, with the R-metalaxyl acid formed at a faster rate.

CGAs (71 compounds), being esters of derivatives of cinnamic acids with quinic acid are widely distributed in plant materials. Coffee is among the highest found in plants, ranging from 4 to 14%. Besides, these are reported in plant foods such as apples, pears, carrot, tomato, sweet potato, Phyllostachys edulis, oilseeds, Prunus domestica L, cherries, and eggplant. The traditional Chinese medicinal plants such as flowers and buds of Lonicera japonica Thunb and the leaves of Eucommia ulmodies contained CGAs as bioactive compound. These play an important role in the formation of roasted coffee flavor and have a marked influence on coffee cup quality. CGAs are considered as main precursors of coffee flavor and pigments. Recent technological advancements in the separation and purification of CGAs such as molecular-imprinted polymer technique; microwave-assisted extraction; pH gradient counter current chromatography has also been described.

An inverse correlation with toxicity was observed in Cry3Aa proteolytic patterns generated by CPB midgut brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from Solanaceae-fed larvae, being the toxin most extensively proteolyzed on potato, followed by eggplant and tomato. We found that CPB cysteine proteases intestains may interact with Cry3Aa toxin and, in CPB BBMV from larvae fed all three Solanaceae, the toxin was able to compete for the hydrolysis of a papain substrate. In response to treatment with the JA-dependent plant inducer Hexanoic acid (Hx), we showed that eggplant reduced OPDA basal levels and both, potato and eggplant induced JA-Ile.

The critical micelle concentrations of detergent A and detergent B were about 250 mg L(-1) and 444 mg L(-1), respectively. Detergent A had a higher solubilizing ability for pesticides and hence washing effectiveness than detergent B. The apparent solubility of CHP increased with increasing detergent concentration, while that of CHT remained comparatively invariant independent of detergent concentration within the tested range. The apparent solubility of CHP was also consistently higher in solutions of both detergents as compared to CHT. Due probably to its lower logKow value, CHT was more readily washed off cherry tomatoes than CHP. In terms of washing, a duration of 10-20 min was sufficient for removal of pesticides on cherry tomatoes in distilled water and detergent solutions.

An in-vitro test was also performed to establish if tomato seeds were able to germinate in various proportions of biochar added to nutrient solution (MS). Biochar significantly increased arsenic concentrations in pore water (500 μg L(-1)-2000 μg L(-1)) whilst root and shoot concentrations were significantly reduced compared to the control without biochar. Fruit As concentrations were very low (<3 μg kg(-1)), indicating minimal toxicity and transfer risk. Fertilisation was required to significantly increase plant biomass above the control after biochar addition whilst plants transplanted to biochar only were heavily stunted and chlorotic. Given that increasing the amount of biochar added to nutrient solution in-vitro reduced seed germination by up to 40%, a lack of balanced nutrient provision from biochar could be concluded. In summary, solubility and mobility of As were increased by biochar addition to this soil, but uptake to plant was reduced, and toxicity-transfer risk was negligible.

In the AALLME method, which excludes any disperser solvent, much less volume of organic solvent is used. In order to form fine and dispersed organic droplets in the aqueous phase, the mixture of aqueous sample solution and extraction solvent is repeatedly aspirated and dispensed with a syringe. In the DLLME method, an appropriate mixture of extraction solvent and disperser solvent is rapidly injected by a syringe into the aqueous sample. Effect of the pertinent experimental factors on DLLME (i.e. identity and volume of the extraction and disperser solvents and ionic strength) and on AALLME (identity and volume of the extraction solvent, number of agitations, and ionic strength) were investigated. Under optimal conditions, limits of detection for the five target pesticides obtained by AALLME-GC-FID and DLLME-GC-FID ranged from 0.20 to 1.1ngmL(-1) and 1.9 to 5.9ngmL(-1), respectively.

In this study, a sensitive and convenient chiral liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for measuring hexaconazole enantiomers in tomato, cucumber, and soil.

The degradation of the two enantiomers of hexaconazole proved to be enantioselective and dependent on the media: The (+)-enantiomer showed a faster degradation in plants, while the (-)-enantiomer dissipated faster than the (+)-form in field soil, resulting in relative enrichment of the opposite enantiomer.

To gain a general and comparative characterization of chromoplast proteins, this study performed proteomic analysis of chromoplasts from six carotenoid-rich crops: watermelon, tomato, carrot, orange cauliflower, red papaya, and red bell pepper. Stromal and membrane proteins of chromoplasts were separated by 1D gel electrophoresis and analysed using nLC-MS/MS. A total of 953-2262 proteins from chromoplasts of different crop species were identified. Approximately 60% of the identified proteins were predicted to be plastid localized. Functional classification using MapMan bins revealed large numbers of proteins involved in protein metabolism, transport, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and redox in chromoplasts from all six species. Seventeen core carotenoid metabolic enzymes were identified. Phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, ζ-carotene desaturase, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 were found in almost all crops, suggesting relative abundance of them among the carotenoid pathway enzymes. Chromoplasts from different crops contained abundant amounts of ATP synthase and adenine nucleotide translocator, which indicates an important role of ATP production and transport in chromoplast development. Distinctive abundant proteins were observed in chromoplast from different crops, including capsanthin/capsorubin synthase and fibrillins in pepper, superoxide dismutase in watermelon, carrot, and cauliflower, and glutathione-S-transferease in papaya.

The first eluted enantiomer was (-)-cyflumetofen and the second eluted one was (+)-cyflumetofen. The method was validated for linearity, repeatability, accuracy, LOD, and LOQ. LOD ranged from 0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg, with the LOD varying from 0.33 to 0.5 mg/kg for each enantiomer, respectively. The average recoveries of the pesticide ranged from 71.4 to 102.0% at all fortification levels.

Its compounds, at levels present in foodstuffs and drinks, are generally considered to be safe for consumption, but for individuals who already suffer from contact allergy to Ni and may be subject to develop systemic reactions from its dietary ingestion, dietary exposure to Ni must be kept under control. Being the second most popular beverage, tea is a potential source of dietary Ni. Present knowledge on its speciation in tea infusions is poor. Therefore, complete speciation analysis, consisting of separation by liquid chromatography using a weak CIM DEAE-1 monolithic column, ""on-line"" detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and ""off-line"" identification of ligands by hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS), was implemented for the first time to study Ni speciation in tea infusions. Total concentrations of Ni in dry leaves of white, green, oolong and black tea (Camellia sinensis) and flowers of herbal chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) and hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa) tea were determined after microwave digestion by ICP-MS. They lay between 1.21 and 14.4 mg kg(-1). Good agreement between the determined and the certified values of the Ni content in the standard reference material SRM 1573a tomato leaves confirmed the accuracy of the total Ni determination. During the infusion process, up to 85 % of Ni was extracted from tea leaves or flowers. Separation of Ni species was completed in 10 min by applying aqueous linear gradient elution with 0.6 mol L(-1) NH(4)NO(3). Ni was found to be present in the chromatographic fraction in which quinic acid was identified by Q-TOF in all the tea infusions analysed, which had pH values between 5.6 and 6.0.

For the correct interpretation of analytical results, uncertainties of extraction and clean-up steps should be taken into account when the combined uncertainty of the analytical result is estimated. In the scope of this study, uncertainties of extraction and clean-up steps were investigated by spiking (14)C-labelled chlorpyrifos to analytical portions of tomato, orange, apple, green bean, cucumber, jackfruit, papaya and starfruit. After each step, replicate measurements were carried out with a liquid scintillation counter. Uncertainties in extraction and clean-up steps were estimated separately for every matrix and method combination by using within-laboratory reproducibility standard deviation and were characterised with the CV of recoveries. It was observed that the uncertainty of the ethyl acetate extraction step varied between 0.8% and 5.9%. The relative standard uncertainty of the clean-up step with dispersive SPE used in the method known as QuEChERS was estimated to be around 1.5% for tomato, apple and green beans. The highest variation of 4.8% was observed in cucumber. The uncertainty of the clean-up step with gel permeation chromatography ranged between 5.3% and 13.1%, and it was relatively higher than that obtained with the dispersive SPE method.","Food additives & contaminants.

Samples were spiked at two different levels: 50 and 100 pg/kg for NAA and 20 and 100 pg/kg for NAAm. These compounds were analyzed within the same chromatographic run with LC coupled to triple quadrupole MS (LC/(QqQ)MS/MS) in positive and negative electrospray ionization [ESI(+) and ESI(-)] modes for NAAm and NAA, respectively. For analyte confirmation, LC/ESI(-)QTOF-MS was also investigated given that NAA has only one multiple reaction monitoring transition (185.1-*140.9 m/z). These three common methods were used to determine linearity, recoveries, precision (RSD), matrix effects, repeatability, and reproducibility (n = 5) for the selected matrixes. In terms of the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (DG-SANCO) guidelines, only insignificant differences were found for the multiresidue methods tested, regardless of the commodity. Matrix-matched calibration was used, and LODs were below 10.1 pg/kg for NAA and 6.0 pg/kg for NAAm, which were lower than the MRLs established in current European Union legislation for these compounds. Obtained recoveries for NAA ranged from 87 to 107% with RSD values below 10% for mini-Luke, 83 to 107% with RSD <11% for EtOAc, and 76 to 85% with RSD <7% for QuEChERS. NAAm recoveries ranged from 74 to 102% with RSD 5 15% for mini-Luke, 76 to 97% with RSD <4% for EtOAc, and 76 to 93% with RSD < 5% for QuEChERS. The linearity of the response over two orders of magnitude was demonstrated (r2 > 0.996) for all methods used. Good repeatability and reproducibility in terms of RSD were obtained (11.3-17.8%) for these analytical methods. The results were acceptable within the studied ranges for both analytes in all methods.

23058941,"Multiresidue methods (MRMs) for pesticides residues determination in fruit and vegetables, based on GC-MS, are mainly performed in electron impact ionization mode. However an important group of them provide much better response working in negative chemical ionization mode due to the elimination of a high percentage of background signal. Considering that a selective and sensitive method has been developed for the determination of multiclass pesticide residues in different commodities by GC-MS with a triple stage quadrupole analyzer (GC-TSQ-MS); the pesticide signal has been optimized in MS-MS whilst working in negative chemical ionization mode using methane as the reagent gas. The proposed method was fully validated for 53 compounds in tomato, apple and orange matrices. The obtained limits of determination were lower than 0.1 μg/kg for more than 50% of the pesticides studied, and lower than 1 μg/kg for all pesticides studied, except for cypermethrin, boscalid, bifenthrin and deltamethrin. Linearity was studied in the 0.5-50 μg/kg range and a linear response was obtained for all pesticides in all matrices. Recoveries were evaluated at two different levels (1 and 50 μg/kg) and recoveries were ranged between 70 and 120% in tomato, apple and orange, except in the cases of chlorfenapyr, ofurace, chlozolinate, chlorothalonil, tolylfluanid and dichlofluanid with recovery values close to 60% at 1 μg/kg fortification levels. Repetitivity was evaluated and the relative standard deviation (RSD%) was lower than 10% in all cases.

The five pyrazole fungicides (bixafen, fluxapyroxad, furametpyr, pyraclostrobin, and rabenzazole) were extracted from seven matrices using acetonitrile and subsequently cleaned up by octadecylsilane (C(18)) or graphitized carbon black (GCB) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The determination of the target compounds was achieved in less than 3.0min using an electrospray ionization source in positive mode (ESI+) for furametpyr, pyraclostrobin, and rabenzazole, while negative mode (ESI-) for bixafen and fluxapyroxad. The method showed excellent linearity (at least R(2)≥ 0.990) for all studied analytes.

22964046,"This paper reports on the development and optimization of a modified Quick, Easy, Cheap Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) based extraction technique coupled with a clean-up dispersive-solid phase extraction (dSPE) as a new, reliable and powerful strategy to enhance the extraction efficiency of free low molecular-weight polyphenols in selected species of dietary vegetables. The process involves two simple steps. First, the homogenized samples are extracted and partitioned using an organic solvent and salt solution. Then, the supernatant is further extracted and cleaned using a dSPE technique. Final clear extracts of vegetables were concentrated under vacuum to near dryness and taken up into initial mobile phase (0.1% formic acid and 20% methanol). The separation and quantification of free low molecular weight polyphenols from the vegetable extracts was achieved by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) equipped with a phodiode array (PDA) detection system and a Trifunctional High Strength Silica capillary analytical column (HSS T3), specially designed for polar compounds. The performance of the method was assessed by studying the selectivity, linear dynamic range, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, trueness, and matrix effects. The validation parameters of the method showed satisfactory figures of merit. Good linearity (Rvalues2>0.954; (+)-catechin in carrot samples) was achieved at the studied concentration range. Reproducibility was better than 3%. Consistent recoveries of polyphenols ranging from 78.4 to 99.9% were observed when all target vegetable samples were spiked at two concentration levels, with relative standard deviations (RSDs, n=5) lower than 2.9%.

The separation of difenoconazole and CGA-205375 including their simultaneous enantioseparation was studied using four different polysaccharide-type chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in combination with n-hexane-polar organic alcohols mobile phase. Chiralcel OJ consisting of 25 % of cellulose tris(4-methylbenzoate) coated on wide-pore polysaccharide silica gel exhibited higher resolving ability compared to cellulose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) (Chiralcel OD) as well as to its similar amylose derivative (Chiralpak AD) CSPs for this particular set of chiral analytes.

22813205,"The rapidly growing demand for organic food requires the availability of analytical tools enabling their authentication. Recently, metabolomic fingerprinting/profiling has been demonstrated as a challenging option for a comprehensive characterisation of small molecules occurring in plants, since their pattern may reflect the impact of various external factors. In a two-year pilot study, concerned with the classification of organic versus conventional crops, ambient mass spectrometry consisting of a direct analysis in real time (DART) ion source and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) was employed. This novel methodology was tested on 40 tomato and 24 pepper samples grown under specified conditions. To calculate statistical models, the obtained data (mass spectra) were processed by the principal component analysis (PCA) followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The results from the positive ionisation mode enabled better differentiation between organic and conventional samples than the results from the negative mode. In this case, the recognition ability obtained by LDA was 97.5% for tomato and 100% for pepper samples and the prediction abilities were above 80% for both sample sets. The results suggest that the year of production had stronger influence on the metabolomic fingerprints compared with the type of farming (organic versus conventional). In any case, DART-TOFMS is a promising tool for rapid screening of samples. Establishing comprehensive (multi-sample) long-term databases may further help to improve the quality of statistical classification models.","Food additives & contaminants.

22685169,"Integrative comparative analyses of transcript and metabolite levels from climacteric and nonclimacteric fruits can be employed to unravel the similarities and differences of the underlying regulatory processes. To this end, we conducted combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and heterologous microarray hybridization assays in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum; climacteric) and pepper (Capsicum chilense; nonclimacteric) fruits across development and ripening. Computational methods from multivariate and network-based analyses successfully revealed the difference between the covariance structures of the integrated data sets. Moreover, our results suggest that both fruits have similar ethylene-mediated signaling components; however, their regulation is different and may reflect altered ethylene sensitivity or regulators other than ethylene in pepper. Genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis were not induced in pepper fruits. Nevertheless, genes downstream of ethylene perception such as cell wall metabolism genes, carotenoid biosynthesis genes, and the never-ripe receptor were clearly induced in pepper as in tomato fruit. While signaling sensitivity or actual signals may differ between climacteric and nonclimacteric fruit, the evidence described here suggests that activation of a common set of ripening genes influences metabolic traits. Also, a coordinate regulation of transcripts and the accumulation of key organic acids, including malate, citrate, dehydroascorbate, and threonate, in pepper fruit were observed.

22500289,"The molecular characteristics of chlorothalonil can cause particular determination difficulties in some vegetable commodities such as leek or garlic. These difficulties are mainly related to the low recoveries obtained using common multi-residue methods (MRMs)--a consequence of the very high interaction level with natural components in the matrix. These shortcomings were pointed out in the last European Proficiency Test for Pesticide Residues on Fruits and Vegetables, where false negatives for chlorothalonil in leek were observed at around 50%. In this study we have evaluated the ethyl acetate, the Dutch mini-Luke and the QuEChERS MRMs to compare their capabilities for chlorothalonil determination using GC-MS/MS in both the electron impact ionization (EI) and negative chemical ionization (NCI) modes. Best recoveries (in the range of 100-120%, with an RSD below 20%) were obtained using the Dutch mini-Luke method. Lower values (52-70%) were obtained for ethyl acetate whereas no recovery was obtained when the QuEChERS method was applied. Furthermore, tomato matrix was also included in the experiments in order to facilitate the comparability of results. Two ionization modes, electron impact ionization (EI) and negative chemical ionization (NCI) in GC-MS/MS, were applied to evaluate their respective advantages and disadvantages for quantification and identification. As expected, NCI showed limits of detection (LODs) 5 to 10 times lower than EI. However, in both cases, the LODs were still below 10 μg kg(-1).

At this stage of the stress period it was possible to discriminate between proteins involved in symptoms and proteins implicated in response. To investigate the changes in the tomato fruit proteome under this specific stressful condition, two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis coupled with spot identification by mass spectrometry was applied. This proteomic approach allowed the identification of differentially expressed proteins which are involved in two main biological functions: (i) defensive mechanisms represented by small heat shock and late embryogenesis proteins; and (ii) reaction to the uncoupling of photosynthetic processes and the protein degradation machinery. One of the first changes observed in chilled fruits is the down-regulation of ATP synthase, 26S proteasome subunit RPN11 and aspartic proteinase, whereas the first responses in order to deal with the stress are mainly multifunctional proteins involved not only in metabolism but also in stress regulation such as glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and invertase.

A homogenised sample was extracted with a mixture of methanol/water (90:10, v/v) and adjusted to pH <3 with formic acid. Primary secondary amine (PSA) adsorbent was used to clean up the sample. The determination was performed using electrospray ionisation (ESI) and a triple quadrupole (QqQ) analyser. Under the optimised method, the results showed that, except for ethephon, the recoveries were 81.8-98.1% in apples and tomatoes at the spiked concentrations of 0.005 to 2 mg/kg, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of less than 11.7%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were lower than their maximum residue limits (MRLs).

The phenomenon of ion suppression can lead to errors in the quantification of the analytes of interest, as well as can affect detection capability, precision, and accuracy of the method. Sample dilution is an easy and effective method to reduce interfering compounds, and so, to diminish matrix effects. In this work, matrix effects of 53 pesticides in three different matrices (orange, tomato and leek) were evaluated. Several dilutions of the matrix were tested in order to study the evolution of signal suppression. Dilution of the extracts led to a reduction of the signal suppression in most of the cases. A dilution factor of 15 demonstrated to be enough to eliminate most of the matrix effects, opening the possibility to perform quantification with solvent based standards in the majority of the cases. In those cases where signal suppression could not be reduced, a possible solution would be to use stable isotope-labelled internal standards for quantification of the problematic pesticides.",Journal of chromatography.

This enantioselective gas chromatographic separation was combined with a clean-up/enrichment procedure based on the modification of QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method. Co-extractives were removed with graphitized carbon black/primary secondary amine (GCB/PSA) solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges using acetonitrile:toluene (3:1, v/v) as eluent. Gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-ITMS) with electron ionization (EI) was then used for qualitative and quantitative determination of the simeconazole enantiomers. Two precursor-to-product ion transitions (m/z 121-101 and 195-153) with the best signal intensity were chosen to build the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) acquisition method. The limits of detection for each enantiomer of simeconazole in six food products ranged between 0.4 and 0.9 μg kg(-1), which were much lower than maximum residue levels (MRLs) established by Japan.

The performance of the instrumental method was evaluated, using seven pesticides, namely oxamyl, methomyl, aldicarb, carbofuran, pirimicarb, thiocarb, and ditalimfos. The limits of detection achieved with the capLC-μAPPI-MS/MS method in the positive ion mode were low, ranging from 0.25 ng mL(-1) for pirimicarb to 5 ng mL(-1) for oxamyl and methomyl, corresponding to 5 and 0.25 μg kg(-1) for tomato samples, respectively, which are clearly below the maximum residue limits for them in fruits and vegetables. The repeatability of the instrumental method ranged from 2.9 to 13.9% (RSD) at a low (0.05 μg mL(-1)) concentration level. An adequate linearity (r(2)=0.984-0.999) at a concentration range from 0.005 to 5.0 μg mL(-1) was observed for all pesticides.

21452898,"Quantitative method validation is a well-established process to demonstrate trueness and precision of the results with a given method. However, an assessment of qualitative results is also an important need to estimate selectivity and devise criteria for chemical identification when using the method, particularly for mass spectrometric analysis. For multianalyte analysis, automatic instrument software is commonly used to make initial qualitative identifications of the target analytes by comparison of their mass spectra against a database library. Especially at low residue levels in complex matrices, manual checking of results is typically needed to correct the peak assignments and integration errors, which is very time-consuming. Low-pressure gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (LP-GC-MS) has been demonstrated to increase the speed of analysis for GC-amenable residues in various foods and provide more advantages over the traditional GC-MS approach. LP-GC-MS on a time-of-flight (ToF) instrument was used, which provided high sample throughput with <10 min analysis time. The method had already been validated to be acceptable quantitatively for nearly 150 pesticides, and in this study of qualitative performance, 90 samples in total of strawberry, tomato, potato, orange, and lettuce extracts from the QuEChERS sample preparation approach were analyzed. The extracts were randomly spiked with different pesticides at different levels, both unknown to the analyst, in the different matrices. Automated software evaluation was compared with human assessments in terms of false-positive and -negative results. Among the 13590 possible permutations with 696 blind additions made, the automated software approach yielded 1.2% false presumptive positives with 23% false negatives, whereas the analyst achieved 0.8% false presumptive positives and 17% false negatives for the same analytical data files. False negatives frequently occurred due to challenges at the lowest concentrations, but 70% of them involved certain pesticides that degraded (e.g., captafol, folpet) or otherwise could not be detected. The false-negative rate was reduced to 5-10% if the problematic analytes were excluded. Despite its somewhat better performance in this study, the analyst approach was extremely time-consuming and would not be practical in high sample throughput applications for so many analytes in complicated matrices.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D005506', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D010573', 'D014675']","['Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Vegetables']","Qualitative aspects in the analysis of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables using fast, low-pressure gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.","['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21452898,2011

The preparation of the samples was very simple: an aliquot of the juice was centrifuged and it was ten-times diluted prior to analysis, which allowed reducing considerably the time and cost of the analyses. Besides, dilution of the samples permits reducing the amount of matrix going into the system, and thus, decreasing the matrix effects, so common in this type of commodities, opening the possibility to perform quantification with solvent based standards. Validation of the method was carried out in accordance with EU guidelines. Calibration curves covering three orders of magnitude were performed, and they were linear over the concentration range studied for all the matrices (from 0.1 to 100 μg L(-1)). Practical limits of quantification were in the low μg L(-1) range, far below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) of the EU regulations, which do not set specific MRLs for juices, and in this cases of processed food, MRLs of the raw product are applied. Repeatability of the instrumental method was studied in all matrices, obtaining good intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs).

An analytical methodology based on solid phase extraction (SPE) and detection by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector (HPLC/DAD) was used for acetamiprid and thiacloprid. Coupled SPE and detection by Gas Chromatography with Mass Selective Detector (GC/MSD) was used for the detection of azinphos-methyl, azoxystrobin, carbaryl, chlorfenapyr and chlorpyrifos residues. Curves were modeled mathematically with Solver program of Microsoft Excel. The best fit for acetamiprid and thiacloprid in peach was achieved with the exponential model (r(2)=0.961 and 0.944, respectively). In the case of peach fruits there is not a Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) for acetamiprid in the Codex Alimentarius, while 0.5 mg/kg is the value rated for thiacloprid. The MRLs accepted by the European Union (EU) are 0.1 mg/kg for acetamiprid and 0.3 mg/kg for thiacloprid. According to the curves determined in these experiments, thiacloprid residues 10 to 12 days after application (daa) were below the MRLs established by both sources. In the case of acetamiprid, 25 daa would be required, according to the exponential mathematical model, to get residues levels below the MRL values established by the EU.

20730643,"A rapid, simple and sensitive multi-residue method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 69 pesticides in fruit and vegetables using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The samples were extracted following the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method known as QuEChERS. Mass spectrometric conditions were individually optimised for each analyte in order to achieve maximum sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Using the developed chromatographic conditions, 69 pesticides can be separated in less than 17 min. Two selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays were used for each pesticide to obtain simultaneous quantification and identification in one run. With this method in SRM mode, more than 150 pesticides can be analysed and quantified, but their confirmation is not possible in all cases according to the European regulations on pesticide residues. Nine common representative matrices (zucchini, melon, cucumber, watermelon, tomato, garlic, eggplant, lettuce and pepper) were selected to investigate the effect of different matrices on recovery and precision. Mean recoveries ranged from 70% to 120%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20% for all the pesticides.

20681659,"Chemical changes in carotenoids and lipids were studied during production and storage of canned tomato juice using ATR infrared spectroscopy and HPLC. Samples from 10 groups of tomatoes with different carotenoid profiles were analyzed fresh, after hot-break and screening, after canning, and at five different time points during 1 year of storage. An apparent increase of carotenoids was observed after hot-break due to improved extraction efficiency. This increase was accompanied by some degree of lipid oxidation and carotenoid isomerization. Canning produced the most intense changes in the lipid profile with breakdown of triglycerides ( approximately 1743 cm(-1)), formation of fatty acids ( approximately 1712 cm(-1)), and degradation and isomerization of trans-carotenoids ( approximately 960 and approximately 3006 cm(-1)). Isomerization was corroborated by the relative increase of HPLC areas corresponding to carotenoid cis isomers. Canning reduced trans-lycopene, trans-delta-carotene, trans-beta-carotene, and trans-lutein by 30, 34, 43, and 67%, respectively. HPLC data indicate that canning causes a drastic reduction of tetra-cis-lycopene and promotes its isomerization to other geometric forms, including all-trans-lycopene. Infrared spectra of tomato juice lipid fractions correlated well with the number of days in storage (SECV < 11 days, r values > 0.99), demonstrating continuous degradation of lipids. Results demonstrated that individual carotenoids and their isomeric forms behave differently during production and storage of canned tomato juice.

20334192,"The matrix effects in HPLC/electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS analysis are difficult to compensate for because of their large variability. It is, therefore, often more practical to include uncertainty due to the matrix effect into the uncertainty budget rather than try to compensate. This work presents an empirical approach--the matrix effect graph approach--for estimating the uncertainty due to the matrix effect in HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. At certain time intervals (1 month), a calibration graph using extracts of different fruits/vegetables as calibration solutions is prepared, and a regression line is fitted through these data. These fruits/vegetables may be either from the commodity group of the samples or from different commodity groups. The relative residuals of the calibration point peak areas are calculated and plotted against the measurement time. We term the resulting graph the matrix effect graph. The root mean square of the relative residuals is calculated and used as the estimate of relative uncertainty of the sample peak areas caused by the matrix effect. The matrix effect graph obtained over fruits/vegetables from different commodity groups can also be used to identify fruits/vegetables with extreme matrix effects. The matrix effect graph approach was used for determination of thiabendazole, aldicarb, imazalil, and methiocarb and was validated with tomato, cucumber, and sweet corn matrixes at the 0.5 mg/kg concentration level. When different commodity groups were used to compile the matrix effect graph, results of analysis of all samples agreed with the spiked concentrations within the expanded uncertainties (at k=2 level).

The mean percent recoveries were 90 +/- 14, 87 +/- 14, 89 +/- 14, and 92 +/- 14% for GC-MS/SIM and 95 +/- 22, 93 +/- 14, 93 +/- 13, and 97 +/- 13% for GC-MS/MS at 10, 25, 100, and 500 microg/kg, respectively. GC-MS/MS was shown to be more effective than GC-MS/SIM due to its specificity and sensitivity in detecting pesticides in fresh produce samples.

The main objectives were to characterize dieldrin accumulation in plant tissues in relation to the levels of soil contamination; uptake capability among plants belonging to different species, varieties and cultivars. The presence of the contaminant was quantified by gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) and confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The results showed a translocation of residues in cucurbitaceous fruits and flowers confirming that zucchini, cucumber and melon are crops with high uptake capability. The maximum level of dieldrin residue at 0.01 mg/kg was found to be a threshold value to safeguard the quality production of cucurbits.

20178389,"Research has suggested that lycopene may be metabolized by eccentric cleavage, catalyzed by beta-carotene oxygenase 2, resulting in the generation of apo-lycopenals. Apo-6'-lycopenal and apo-8'-lycopenal have been reported previously in raw tomato. We now show that several other apo-lycopenals are also present in raw and processed foods, as well as in human plasma. Apo-lycopenal standards were prepared by in vitro oxidation of lycopene, and a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in negative mode was developed to separate and detect the apo-6'-, apo-8'-, apo-10'-, apo-12'-, apo-14'-, and apo-15'-lycopenal products formed in the reaction. Hexane/acetone extracts of raw tomato, red grapefruit, watermelon, and processed tomato products were analyzed, as well as plasma of individuals who had consumed tomato juice for 8 weeks. Apo-6'-, apo-8'-, apo-10'-, apo-12'-, and apo-14'-lycopenals were detected and quantified in all food products tested, as well as plasma. The sum of apo-lycopenals was 6.5 microg/100 g Roma tomato, 73.4 microg/100 g tomato paste, and 1.9 nmol/L plasma. We conclude that several apo-lycopenals, in addition to apo-6'- and -8'-lycopenal, are present in lycopene-containing foods.

19757452,"In recent years identification of the geographical origin of food has grown more important as consumers have become interested in knowing the provenance of the food that they purchase and eat. Certification schemes and labels have thus been developed to protect consumers and genuine producers from the improper use of popular brand names or renowned geographical origins. As the tomato is one of the major components of what is considered to be the healthy Mediterranean diet, it is important to be able to determine the geographical origin of tomatoes and tomato-based products such as tomato sauce. The aim of this work is to develop an analytical method to determine rare earth elements (RRE) for the control of the geographic origin of tomatoes. The content of REE in tomato plant samples collected from an agricultural area in Piacenza, Italy, was determined, using four different digestion procedures with and without HF. Microwave dissolution with HNO3 + H2O2 proved to be the most suitable digestion procedure. Inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICPQMS) and inductively coupled plasma sector field plasma mass spectrometry (ICPSFMS) instruments, both coupled with a desolvation system, were used to determine the REE in tomato plants in two different laboratories. A matched calibration curve method was used for the quantification of the analytes. The detection limits (MDLs) of the method ranged from 0.03 ng g(-1) for Ho, Tm, and Lu to 2 ng g(-1) for La and Ce. The precision, in terms of relative standard deviation on six replicates, was good, with values ranging, on average, from 6.0% for LREE (light rare earth elements) to 16.5% for HREE (heavy rare earth elements). These detection limits allowed the determination of the very low concentrations of REE present in tomato berries. For the concentrations of REE in tomato plants, the following trend was observed: roots > leaves > stems > berries.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D018551', 'D013058', 'D008674', 'D018514']","['Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metals, Rare Earth', 'Plant Structures']",Determination of rare earth elements in tomato plants by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry techniques.,"['Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19757452,2009
19733738,"Liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry--LC/ESI/MS--a primary tool for analysis of low volatility compounds in difficult matrices--suffers from the matrix effects in the ESI ionization. It is well known that matrix effects can be reduced by sample dilution. However, the efficiency of simple sample dilution is often limited, in particular by the limit of detection of the method, and can strongly vary from sample to sample. In this study matrix effect is investigated as the function of dilution. It is demonstrated that in some cases dilution can eliminate matrix effect, but often it is just reduced. Based on these findings we propose a new quantitation method based on consecutive dilutions of the sample and extrapolation of the analyte content to the infinite dilution, i.e. to matrix-free solution. The method was validated for LC/ESI/MS analysis of five pesticides (methomyl, thiabendazole, aldicarb, imazalil, methiocarb) in five matrices (tomato, cucumber, apple, rye and garlic) at two concentration levels (0.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1)). Agreement between the analyzed and spiked concentrations was found for all samples. It was demonstrated that in terms of accuracy of the obtained results the proposed extrapolative dilution approach works distinctly better than simple sample dilution. The main use of this approach is envisaged for (a) method development/validation to determine the extent of matrix effects and the ways of overcoming them and (b) as a second step of analysis in the case of samples having analyte contents near the maximum residue limits (MRL).",Analytica chimica acta,[],[],Combating matrix effects in LC/ESI/MS: the extrapolative dilution approach.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733738,2009

High-resolution tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify accurately peptide masses and their constituent sequences from partially purified plant virus preparations. Analysis of the peptide fragment masses against a virus database using pattern-matching algorithms identified sequences with homology to known virus peptides and also predicted peptides using de novo sequence analysis. This method provided sufficient information to confirm the identity of two known viruses that were included as controls (Cucumber mosaic virus and Tomato spotted wilt virus) and to identify unknown viruses in six viral isolates. The unknown viruses have been identified as four common viruses (Alfalfa mosaic virus, Tobacco streak virus, Citrus leaf blotch virus and Ribgrass mosaic virus), and two novel viruses (a potexvirus and a vitivirus).

19686752,"The enzyme pectin methylesterase (PME) was purified from red ripe tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) and through affinity chromatography two isoenzymes were fractionated (t1PME and t2PME). Further analysis of these two isoenzymes, both having a molar mass of 34.5kDa, revealed a difference in the N-terminal sequence and in amino acid composition. t1PME was identified as the major isoenzyme of PME in tomato fruit. In this study the aim was to develop a toolbox, consisting of monoclonal antibodies, that allows to gain insight into the in situ localization of PME in plant based food systems like tomatoes. A panel of six interesting monoclonal antibodies was raised against both isoenzymes, designated MA-TOM1-12E11, MA-TOM1-41B2, MA-TOM2-9H8, MA-TOM2-20G7, MA-TOM2-31H1 and MA-TOM2-38A11. The differences in epitopes between these monoclonal antibodies were determined using affinity tests towards denatured PME, cross-reactivity tests and inhibition tests. Characterization of these antibodies indicated an immunological difference between t1PME and t2PME, also revealing a conserved epitope on t2PME, carrot PME and strawberry PME. Different epitopes are recognized by the generated antibodies making them excellent probes for immunolocalization of PME by tissue printing. In tomato, t1PME and t2PME showed a pronounced co-localization, especially in the pericarp and the radial arms of the pericarp.

The protein was eluted through HiTrap DEAE FF and RESOURCE Q anion exchange chromatography and displayed as a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 36 kDa on silver staining sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The pI of the purified protein PebC1 was determined by 2-DE and was 4.85. Three peptide segments were obtained by MALDI-TOF. Similarity, the homology matching using protein BLAST search found that two proteins, viz. XP_001593856 and XP_001551609 were having high score and covered sequence of the three peptides. Protein XP_001551609, a deduced protein nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha-polypeptide, was more authentic because it was from Botryotinia fuckeliana that is better known as its anamorph, B.cinerea and showed 95% homology with the three polypeptides.

Metal contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, whereas pesticide residues were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after extraction performed using solid-phase microextraction technique. Soil characterization based on the determination of selected physical and chemical properties revealed heterogeneous soils belonging to different soil groups.

The presence of other herbicides, namely prometryn, chloridazon, acetochlor, flurochloridone, and napropamide, was registered in some soil samples as well. Among the insecticides investigated in the soil, fenitrothion and chlorpyrifos were the only ones detected.

The monitoring of cadmium has a significant role in the management of cadmium intake. Cadmium purification and quantification using immunochromatography were conducted in this study as an alternative means of cadmium analysis. The samples used in this study were rice, tomato, lettuce, garden pea, Arabidopsis thaliana (a widely used model organism for studying plants), soil, and fertilizer. The cadmium immunochromatography has been produced from the monoclonal antibody Nx2C3, which recognize the chelate form of cadmium, Cd.EDTA. The immunochromatography can be used for quantification of cadmium in a range from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/L at 20% mean coefficient of variance. A chelate column employing quaternary ammonium salts was used for the purification of cadmium from HCl extracts of samples. Recoveries of cadmium were near 100%, and the lowest recovery was 76.6% from rice leaves. The estimated cadmium concentrations from the immunochromatography procedure were evaluated by comparison with the results of instrumental analysis (ICP-AES or ICP-MS). By comparison of HCl extracts analyzed by ICP-MS and column eluates analyzed by immunochromatography of the samples, the estimated cadmium concentrations were closely similar, and their recoveries were from 98 to 116%.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002104', 'D002846', 'D010945', 'D012987']","['Cadmium', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Plants, Edible', 'Soil']",Cadmium purification and quantification using immunochromatography.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19489614,2009

Developing rapid and cost-effective techniques for identifying pathogens to subspecies is critical for tracking causes of foodborne disease outbreaks. The objective of this study was to develop a method for rapid identification and differentiation of Salmonella serovars and strains within these serovars through isolation on hydrophobic grid membrane filters (HGMFs), examination by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and microspectroscopy, and data analysis by multivariate statistical techniques. Salmonella serovars (Anatum, Enteritidis, Heidelberg, Kentucky, Muenchen, and Typhimurium), most of which were represented by multiple strains, were grown in tryptic soy broth (24 h at 42 degrees C), diluted to 10(2) to 10(3) CFU/ml, and filtered using HGMFs. The membranes were incubated on Miller-Mallinson agar (24 h at 42 degrees C), and typical Salmonella colonies were sonicated in 50% acetonitrile and centrifuged. Resulting pellets were vacuum dried on a ZnSe crystal and analyzed using IR spectroscopy. Alternatively, the membranes containing Salmonella growth were removed from the agar, vacuum dried, and colonies were analyzed directly by IR microspectroscopy. Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) models were developed from spectra. The method was validated by analyzing Salmonella-inoculated tomato juice, eggs, milk, and chicken. Salmonella serovars exhibited distinctive and reproducible spectra in the fingerprint region (1,200 to 900 cm(-1)) of the IR spectrum. SIMCA permitted distinguishing Salmonella strains from each other through differences in bacterial lipopolysaccharides and other membrane components. The model correctly predicted Salmonella in foods at serovar (100%) and strain (90%) levels.

As a result, manufacturers and regulatory agencies concerned with monitoring lot-to-lot product quality may find this approach an attractive alternative to the more classical acid-decomposition, cold vapor atomic absorption methodology. Dietary supplement samples analyzed included astragalus, calcium, chromium picolinate, echinacea, ephedra, fish oil, ginger, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, goldenseal, guggul, senna, St John's wort, and yohimbe products. Quality control samples analyzed with the dietary supplements indicated a high level of method accuracy and precision.

Evidence is mainly against all-E-beta-carotene, while there is no evidence against other carotenoids or against mixtures of beta-carotene stereoisomers. Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets.

Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to assess the effects of cooking on the micellarisation of beta-carotene, lycopene, beta-cryptoxanthin and lutein from courgette (zucchini), red pepper and tomato; and, to a minor extent, investigate uptake of lutein by Caco-2 cells from micellar fractions obtained from raw and cooked courgettes. Both raw and cooked vegetables were subjected to an in vitro digestion procedure. beta-Carotene levels were significantly decreased in the digesta from each vegetable after boiling, grilling, microwave-cooking, or steaming, however all of the cooking methods enhanced beta-carotene transfer to micelles. Carotenoid micellarisation ranged from 1.7% to 100% depending on the food, carotenoid, and the cooking method tested. Grilling and microwave-cooking were generally the most detrimental on the transfer of xanthophyll carotenoids, namely beta-cryptoxanthin, to the micelles. Caco-2 cells absorbed greater amounts of lutein from the micelles of microwave-cooked courgettes than those that were raw, boiled, grilled, or steamed. Depending on the cooking methods used, carotenoid retention as well as micellarisation varied for each carotenoid among the different vegetables and different carotenoids present in each particular food.","Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)","['D001682', 'D018938', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D003296', 'D028464', 'D004063', 'D006801', 'D007413', 'D008823', 'D008954', 'D014675']","['Biological Availability', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cooking', 'Cucurbita', 'Digestion', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Micelles', 'Models, Biological', 'Vegetables']",Micellarisation of carotenoids from raw and cooked vegetables.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587647,2008

Tomato fruit contain well-known antioxidants such as vitamin C, carotenoids, flavonoids, and hydroxycinnamic acids. The industrial processing of this fruit into tomato paste involves several treatments that potentially affect the final profile of antioxidants and other metabolites in the commercial product. Here we have used both biochemical and metabolomic techniques to assess the effect of each separate step in the industrial production chain starting from fresh fruit to the final tomato paste. Material was collected from five independent tomato paste production events spread over two successive years. Samples comprised the intact ripe fruits and semifinished products after fruit-breaking, separation of the pulp from skin and seeds, evaporation, and finally after canning and pasteurization. The effect of each processing step was determined by different types of analysis. First, the total antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content were determined by commonly used spectrophotometric methods. Second, individual antioxidants in the extracts were identified and compared using an HPLC with online antioxidant detection. Third, in each sample the levels of the major individual antioxidants present, i.e., vitamin C, phenolic compounds (such as rutin and chlorogenic acid), tocopherols, and carotenoids, were quantified. Fourth, an untargeted metabolomic approach using LC-QTOF-MS was used to identify those production steps that have the largest impact on the overall metabolic profile in the final paste as compared to the original fruits. This multifaceted approach has revealed that each processing step induces specific alterations in the metabolic profile, as determined by the different analysis procedures, and that in particular the fruit-breaking step and the removal of seed and skin significantly affect the levels of antioxidants and many other metabolites present in commercial tomato paste.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000975', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D038441', 'D005419', 'D005511', 'D005638', 'D018551', 'D013053']","['Antioxidants', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diet, Mediterranean', 'Flavonoids', 'Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Spectrophotometry']",Changes in antioxidant and metabolite profiles during production of tomato paste.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18205308,2008

In this study, we investigated complexation between Cu(II) and N(alpha)-(1-deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-L-histidine (D-fructose-L-histidine, FruHis). The content of FruHis in two types of commercial tomato powders was estimated by GLC-MS, using single ion monitoring of trimethylsilylated FruHis hydroxyoximate, as 40 mg/100 g, whereas the concentration of free histidine in the powder samples was about 53 mg/100 g. The Cu(II)-binding ability of FruHis was studied along with structurally related molecules L-histidine, dipeptide L-carnosine, and N(alpha)-(1-deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-L-arginine (FruArg) at 25 degrees C using pH-potentiometric titrations. Analysis of the titration curves showed that formation of Cu(II)-FruHis complex species occurs at pH values as low as 2 and that the complexes were redox stable in the pH range 2-10.5, at least for the time of the experiment. At physiological pH, Cu(II) and FruHis form a dominant coordination species of composition MLH-1 (log beta = 5.67), with a presumably deprotonated anomeric hydroxyl group of the fructose portion. The apparent stability constant of 1:1 complexes formed by FruHis and Cu(II) in neutral aqueous solutions is about 10(4) times higher than similar values calculated for L-histidine, L-carnosine, and FruArg. FruHis nearly completely protected hydroxyl radical-mediated fragmentation of polymeric DNA in the presence of the Cu/H2O2/ascorbate system, whereas neither of the reference compounds could inhibit the DNA fragmentation as efficiently in similar conditions.

Several classes of compounds belonging to different chemical families (triazines, organophosphorous, carbamates, phenylureas, neonicotinoids, etc.) were carefully chosen to cover a wide range of applications in the environmental field. Excellent chromatographic separation was achieved by the use of narrow accurate mass windows (0.05 Da) in a 30 min interval. Accurate mass measurements were always below 2 ppm error for all the pesticides studied. A table compiling the accurate masses for 101 compounds together with the accurate mass of several fragment ions is included. At least the accurate mass for one main fragment ion for each pesticide was obtained to achieve the minimum of identification points according to the 2002/657/EC European Decision, thus fulfilling the EU point system requirement for identification of contaminants in samples. The method was validated with vegetable samples. Calibration curves were linear and covered two orders of magnitude (from 5 to 500 microg/L) for most of the compounds studied.

Degradation half-lives in soil were found to be four times slower compared with half-lives on plant surfaces. In a second step, we explored measured plant surface half-lives directly with those in vegetation. The results were validated by comparing computed values with results obtained from an experimental set-up. The uptake and dissipation of alpha-cypermethrin (insecticide) and bromopropylate (acaricide) was studied by detecting pesticide residues in whole and peeled tomato fruits using gas chromatography. Half-lives within vegetation were found to be four times faster compared with plant surface half-lives.

17636940,"Fragaria x ananassa enone oxidoreductase (FaEO), earlier putatively assigned as quinone oxidoreductase, is a ripening-induced, negatively auxin-regulated enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (HDMF), the key flavor compound in strawberry fruit by the reduction of the alpha,beta-unsaturated bond of the highly reactive precursor 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-2-methylene-3(2H)-furanone (HMMF). Here we show that recombinant FaEO does not reduce the double bond of straight-chain 2-alkenals or 2-alkenones but rather hydrogenates previously unknown HMMF derivatives substituted at the methylene functional group. The furanones were prepared from 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone with a number of aldehydes and a ketone. The kinetic data for the newly synthesized aroma-active substrates and products are similar to the values obtained for an enone oxidoreductase from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyzing the alpha,beta-hydrogenation of 2-alkenals. HMMF, the substrate of FaEO that is formed during strawberry fruit ripening, was also detected in tomato and pineapple fruit by HPLC-ESI-MSn and became 13C-labeled when d-[6-13C]-glucose was applied to the fruits, which suggested that a similar HDMF biosynthetic pathway occurs in the different plant species. With a database search (http://ted.bti.cornell.edu/ and http://genet.imb.uq.edu.au/Pineapple/), we identified a tomato and pineapple expressed sequence tag that shows significant homology to FaEO.

The pathways involved in these processes are unique to plants and vary between species. Climacteric fruit ripening, especially in tomato, has been extensively studied; yet, ripening of non-climacteric fruit is poorly understood. Although the different species share common pathways; developmental programs, physiological, anatomical, biochemical composition and structural differences must contribute to the operation of unique pathways, genes and proteins. Citrus has a non-climacteric fruit ripening behavior and has a unique anatomical fruit structure. For the last few years a citrus genome-wide ESTs project has been initiated and consists of 222,911 clones corresponding to 19,854 contigs and 37,138 singletons. Taking advantage of the citrus database we analyzed the citrus proteome. Using LC-MS/MS we analyzed soluble and enriched membrane fractions of mature citrus fruit to identify the proteome of fruit juice cells.

Among the vegetables, tomatoes are a main component of the traditional Mediterranean diet, which has been associated with health protection and longevity. Eating tomatoes has been associated with reduced risks of some types of cancer and other diseases. These beneficial properties appear to be related to the antioxidant content of the fruit, particularly carotenoids (lycopene and beta-carotene), ascorbic acid, and phenols, which may play a role in inhibiting reactions mediated by reactive oxygen species. Due to the importance of antioxidant compounds in tomatoes and tomato products, we present here an overview of current analytical methods (from 2000 until the present date) for determining the different antioxidants. The analytical procedures used to determine individual compounds involve extraction from the sample, analytical separation, and quantification.

Although they are widespread throughout the plant kingdom, some flavonoid classes are specific for only a few plant species. Due to their presumed health benefits there is growing interest in the development of food crops with tailor-made levels and composition of flavonoids, designed to exert an optimal biological effect. In order to explore the possibilities of flavonoid engineering in tomato fruits, we have targeted this pathway towards classes of potentially healthy flavonoids which are novel for tomato. Using structural flavonoid genes (encoding stilbene synthase, chalcone synthase, chalcone reductase, chalcone isomerase and flavone synthase) from different plant sources, we were able to produce transgenic tomatoes accumulating new phytochemicals. Biochemical analysis showed that the fruit peel contained high levels of stilbenes (resveratrol and piceid), deoxychalcones (butein and isoliquiritigenin), flavones (luteolin-7-glucoside and luteolin aglycon) and flavonols (quercetin glycosides and kaempferol glycosides). Using an online high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) antioxidant detection system, we demonstrated that, due to the presence of the novel flavonoids, the transgenic tomato fruits displayed altered antioxidant profiles. In addition, total antioxidant capacity of tomato fruit peel with high levels of flavones and flavonols increased more than threefold.

Transgenic plants accumulated new compounds, not present in either wild-type or vector-transformed plants. These were identified, by high-pressure liquid chromatography, as trans-resveratrol and trans-resveratrol-glucopyranoside. The amounts of trans-resveratrol and its piceid form were evaluated in the transgenic fruit. It was found that the content of the metabolite varied during fruit maturation to up to 53 microg/g fresh weight of total trans-resveratrol at the red stage of ripening. This metabolite accumulation was possibly dependent on a combination of sufficiently high levels of stilbene synthase and the availability of substrates. With the aim of verifing the metabolic impairment, the amounts of chlorogenic acid and naringenin in both transgenic and wild-type ripening fruit were compared and no dramatic variation in the synthesis profile of the two metabolites was noted. To our knowledge, no data are available on the assessment of the effects of the expression of the StSy gene on other antioxidant compounds present in tomato fruit. To establish whether the presence of a novel antioxidant molecule affected the redox regulation in transgenic tomato fruit cells, the effect of resveratrol accumulation on the naturally present antioxidant pool was analysed. We showed that, in transgenic fruit which accumulate trans-resveratrol, there is an increase in the levels of ascorbate and glutathione, the soluble antioxidants of primary metabolism, as well as in the total antioxidant activity. Conversely, the content of tocopherol and lycopene, which are membrane-located antioxidants, is not affected.

16950327,"Trifloxystrobin, fenhexamid and famoxadone belong to the generation of fungicides acting against a broad spectrum of fungi and widely used in Integrated Pest Management strategies in different agricultural crops but mainly in viticulture. In the present work, a gas chromatographic (GC) method for their determination was developed and validated on tomato, grape and wine matrices. The method was based on a simple one step liquid-liquid microextraction with cyclohexane/dichloromethane (9+1, v/v) and determination of fungicides by gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorous (NP-) and electron capture (EC-) detection, and ion trap mass spectrometry (ITMS) for confirmation. The method was validated by recovery experiments, assessment of matrix effect and calculation of the associated uncertainty. Recoveries for GC-NPD and GC-ECD were found in the range of 81-102% with RSD <12%, while matrix-matched calibration solutions were imposed for quantification. LOQs ranged from 0.005 to 0.05 mg/kg and 0.01 to 0.10 mg/kg for the GC-ECD and GC-NPD, respectively, depending on the sensitivity of each compound with trifloxystrobin being the most sensitive. The expanded uncertainty, calculated for a sample concentration of 0.10 mg/kg, ranged from 4.8 to 13% for the GC-ECD and from 5.4 to 29% for the GC-NPD.

Here we present the Metabolome Tomato Database (MoTo DB), a metabolite database dedicated to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)- based metabolomics of tomato fruit (Solanum lycopersicum). A reproducible analytical approach consisting of reversed-phase LC coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight MS and photodiode array detection (PDA) was developed for large-scale detection and identification of mainly semipolar metabolites in plants and for the incorporation of the tomato fruit metabolite data into the MoTo DB. Chromatograms were processed using software tools for mass signal extraction and alignment, and intensity-dependent accurate mass calculation. The detected masses were assigned by matching their accurate mass signals with tomato compounds reported in literature and complemented, as much as possible, by PDA and MS/MS information, as well as by using reference compounds. Several novel compounds not previously reported for tomato fruit were identified in this manner and added to the database. The MoTo DB is available at http://appliedbioinformatics.wur.nl and contains all information so far assembled using this LC-PDA-quadrupole time-of-flight MS platform, including retention times, calculated accurate masses, PDA spectra, MS/MS fragments, and literature references.

Given the anionic character of ethephon, the use of ion-pairing liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS, triple quadrupole) allowed its direct determination in these matrices avoiding a derivatisation step and favouring the automation of the method. Samples were extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane/aqueous formic acid (pH 3) (1:1). Then, tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBA) was added as an ion-pairing reagent, and an aliquot of the aqueous extract was directly injected into the LC/MS/MS system. Quantification was performed with matrix-matched standards prepared from blank sample extracts. MS/MS measurements were made in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, using the most sensitive transition (m/z 107 > 79) for quantification, and up to four additional transitions for confirmation. Quantitative recoveries were obtained for all matrices (between 83% and 96%) at two concentration levels tested (0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg), with relative standard deviations lower than 9% in all cases. The addition of TBA directly into the sample extract contained in the injection vial was found sufficient to obtain satisfactory LC retention for the analyte. Under these conditions, the absence of ion-pairing reagent in the mobile phase minimised the ionisation suppression for ethephon in the MS source, leading to an increase in the sensitivity of the method and reaching limits of detection of 0.02 mg/kg for all matrices investigated. The acquisition of five specific MS/MS transitions for ethephon allowed the simultaneous and reliable quantification and confirmation of the analyte in the samples.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D002853', 'D009943', 'D010937', 'D021241', 'D014675']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Organophosphorus Compounds', 'Plant Growth Regulators', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Vegetables']",An ion-pairing liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method for the determination of ethephon residues in vegetables.,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","['methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16381059,2006

However, after irradiation of an unrealistically spiked apple (134 mg/kg) different photoproducts including aminoparathion (AP) were detectable by HPLC, proving that the hitherto postulated photochemistry of parathion indeed takes place in the fruit cuticle environment. Besides the photoreduction pathway it was shown for the first time that AP is also easily formed by reduction of the primary photoproduct nitrosoparathion with thiols (cysteine, glutathione), while ascorbic acid only leaves hydroxylaminoparathion. In the presence of polyphenols, AP was effectively bound to quinone intermediates formed by both silver oxide and polyphenol oxidases.

However, in the presence of caffeic acid, catechol, naringin, and quercetin, respectively, insoluble dark colored polymers precipitated within 48 h, while in the supernatants AP was not detectable any more. Polymer-bound and nonextractable AP was proven by transesterification with sodium ethoxide releasing O,O,O-triethyl thiophosphate which was determined by GC.

These unique peptides were found to be similar to the xyloglucan-specific fungal endoglucanase inhibitor protein (XEGIP) precursor in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and its homolog in potato (Solanum tuberosum). A pair of oligonucleotide primers was designed based on the potato and tomato sequences that were used to clone a 1,018-bp internal piece of nec4 cDNA from a stage 6 nectary cDNA library. The remaining portions of the cDNA were subsequently captured by 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Complete sequencing of the nec4 cDNA demonstrated that it belonged to a large family of homologous proteins from a wide variety of angiosperms. Related proteins include foliage proteins and seed storage proteins. Based upon conserved identity with the wheat (Triticum aestivum) xylanase inhibitor TAXI-1, we were able to develop a protein model that showed that NEC4 contains additional amino acid loops that are not found in TAXI-1 and that glycosylation sites are surface exposed. Both these loops and sites of glycosylation are on the opposite face of the NEC4 molecule from the site that interacts with fungal hemicellulases, as indicated by homology to TAXI-I. NEC4 also contains a region homologous to the TAXI-1 knottin domain; however, a deletion in this domain restructures the disulfide bridges of this domain, resulting in a pseudoknottin domain. Inhibition assays were performed to determine whether purified NEC4 was able to inhibit fungal endoglucanases and xylanases. These studies showed that NEC4 was a very effective inhibitor of a family GH12 xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase with a K(i) of 0.35 nm. However, no inhibitory activity was observed against other family GH10 or GH11 xylanases. The patterns of expression of the NEC4 protein indicate that, while expressed in nectar at anthesis, it is most strongly expressed in the nectary gland after fertilization, indicating that inhibition of fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes may be more important after fertilization than before.",Plant physiology,"['D000595', 'D002480', 'D002851', 'D003001', 'D018076', 'D018506', 'D006031', 'D008958', 'D008969', 'D010802', 'D010940', 'D011487', 'D012333', 'D016415', 'D019032', 'D014026']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cellulase', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Glycosylation', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Proteins', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tobacco']","Nectarin IV, a potent endoglucanase inhibitor secreted into the nectar of ornamental tobacco plants.

The chromatographic separation of the studied compounds and their MS parameters were optimized to improve selectivity and sensitivity. In both methods, separation was carried out with two coupled columns, first a C(18) and then a dC(18), using as mobile phase 70% methanol (0.005% acetic acid) and 30% acetic acid 0.05% for ascorbic acid determination and a mixture of methanol, tetrahydrofuran, and acetonitrile (60:30:10 v/v/v) for carotenoid analysis in isocratic mode. The molecular ion was selected for the quantification in selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Ascorbic acid was detected with electrospray ionization probe (ESI) in negative mode, while chemical ionization atmospheric pressure (APCI) in positive mode was used for the target carotenoids. The methodology for ascorbic acid analysis is based on an extraction with polytron using methanol and a mixture of methaphosphoric acid and acetic acid. Extraction of the carotenoids was carried out with tetrahydrofuran/methanol (1:1) (v/v). The proposed methods were applied, after their corresponding validations, to the analysis of four varieties of tomatoes, tomato in tin enriched and dried tomato, and to the analysis of mango and kiwi fruits, to compare the content in these compounds.

The combination of high sensitivity full-scan spectra incorporating accurate mass measurements (routinely better than 2 ppm accuracy) of the protonated molecules with the evidence from resolved isotopic clusters provides the ability to obtain a reduced number of possible elemental compositions (typically 1-2). Databases were then used to find the identity of the suspected species using the elemental composition as a searching criterion. The accurate mass and the generated elemental composition of characteristic fragment ions of the suspected species provide further evidence for the proposed species. With this approach we have identified the following chlorinated pesticides in different market-purchased fruit and vegetable extracts: Chlorotoluron (tomato), iprodione (apple), and procymidone (grapes). Finally, the confirmation and quantitation of these suspected species were successfully accomplished with standards. Other unknown compounds could be partially identified based on the data obtained within this study.

The analytical performance of the method was evaluated for different types of fruit and vegetables: pepper, broccoli, tomato, orange, lemon, apple and melon. The accurate mass measurements were compared in different matrices at significantly different concentration levels (from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg) obtaining accuracy errors lower than 2 ppm, which is well within the accepted limits for elemental confirmation. Linearity of response over two orders of magnitude was demonstrated (r > 0.99). Matrix effects resulting in suppression or enhancement of the response were frequently observed, most notably in broccoli and citrus. Instrumental limits of detection (LOD) were between 0.0005 and 0.03 mg/kg depending on the commodity and pesticide studied, all being within European Union regulations for food monitoring program. Finally, the methodology was applied to the analysis of two samples from an inter-laboratory exercise.

The method is based on stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) coupled to thermal desorption (TD) and retention time locked (RTL) GC-MS operating in the scan mode. Samples are extracted with methanol and diluted with water prior to SBSE. Dilution of the methanol extract before SBSE was optimized to obtain high sensitivity and to minimize adsorption onto the glass wall of the extraction vessel as well as to minimize sample matrix effects (particularly for the pesticides with high log K(o,w) values). The optimized method consists of a dual SBSE extraction performed simultaneously on respectively a twofold and a fivefold diluted methanol extract. After extraction, the two stir bars are placed in a single glass thermal desorption liner and are simultaneously desorbed. The method showed good linearity (r2 > 0.9900) and high sensitivity (limit of detection: < 5 microg kg(-1)) for most of the target pesticides.

Xyloglucans, solubilized from plant cell walls by a sequential (enzymatic and chemical) extraction procedure, were isolated, and their structures were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. All campanulids examined, including Lactuca sativa (lettuce, order Asterales), Tenacetum ptarmiciflorum (dusty miller, order Asterales), and Daucus carota (carrot, order Apiales), produce typical xyloglucans that have an XXXG-type branching pattern and contain alpha-d-Xylp-, beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Xylp-, and alpha-L-Fucp-(1-->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Xylp- side chains. However, the lamiids produce atypical xyloglucans. For example, previous analyses showed that Capsicum annum (pepper) and Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato), two species in the order Solanales, and Olea europaea (olive, order Lamiales) produce xyloglucans that contain arabinosyl and galactosyl residues, but lack fucosyl residues. The XXGG-type xyloglucans produced by Solanaceous species are less branched than the XXXG-type xyloglucan produced by Olea europaea. This study shows that Ipomoea pupurea (morning glory, order Solanales), Ocimum basilicum (basil, order Lamiales), and Plantago major (plantain, order Lamiales) all produce xyloglucans that lack fucosyl residues and have an unusual XXGGG-type branching pattern in which the basic repeating core contains five glucose subunits in the backbone. Furthermore, Neruim oleander (order Gentianales) produces an XXXG-type xyloglucan that contains arabinosyl, galactosyl, and fucosyl residues.

The mean proportion remaining after heating cypermethrin in water for 10 min was 66%, falling to 27% after 1 h. Similarly, thermal processing of canned tomatoes caused cypermethrin to degrade, with remaining levels in the final product ranging from 30 to 60% of the original.

15508043,"This study was initiated to demonstrate the impact of tolerance intervals calculated based on experimental data and standard criteria on the capability to detect and identify pesticide residues by GC-MS in plant extract. The tolerance intervals specified by the current guidelines and standards (EU, EPA, ISO, EC) result in a large number of false negative values. The tolerance intervals calculated based on the actually measured ion ratios at 2 different probability levels did not provide a better estimate. Based on experimental findings a 2-phase procedure for confirmation of pesticide residues is recommended. The first screening phase comprises identification of those pesticide residues that are likely to be present avoiding false negatives as far as possible. Relatively large tolerance intervals, +/-30% of absolute ion abundances ratios, have to be used at this point. When 2 or 3 selected ion ratios are within the established tolerance intervals the residue is confirmed. When the ions detected still indicate the possible presence of a residue the result may be reported as tentatively identified. However, when the result would lead to regulatory action, second confirmatory phase has to be undertaken. This can be achieved with the same GC-MS equipment, by injecting matrix-matched standards of the suspected analyte, in order to compensate for matrix influence on ion ratios.

The formulation was sprayed on pepper and tomato foliage when tomato fruits became red ripe and pepper became mature green at the rate of 6 lbs of formulated product per acre (5.4 and 27.2 g AI of pyrethrins and PBO, respectively). Following spraying, pepper and tomato leaves and fruits were collected at different time intervals for residue analysis using a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a UV detector. Residues of pyrethrins and PBO were generally higher on the leaves than fruits. Initial deposits (1 h following spraying) of pyrethrins were significantly higher on pepper than tomato fruits.

15096512,"The oomycetes form one of several lineages within the eukaryotes that independently evolved a parasitic lifestyle and consequently are thought to have developed alternative mechanisms of pathogenicity. The oomycete Phytophthora infestans causes late blight, a ravaging disease of potato and tomato. Little is known about processes associated with P. infestans pathogenesis, particularly the suppression of host defense responses. We describe and functionally characterize an extracellular protease inhibitor, EPI1, from P. infestans. EPI1 contains two domains with significant similarity to the Kazal family of serine protease inhibitors. Database searches suggested that Kazal-like proteins are mainly restricted to animals and apicomplexan parasites but appear to be widespread and diverse in the oomycetes. Recombinant EPI1 specifically inhibited subtilisin A among major serine proteases and inhibited and interacted with the pathogenesis-related P69B subtilisin-like serine protease of tomato in intercellular fluids. The epi1 and P69B genes were coordinately expressed and up-regulated during infection of tomato by P. infestans. Inhibition of tomato proteases by EPI1 could form a novel type of defense-counterdefense mechanism between plants and microbial pathogens.

Cucurbitacins are reported to be gibberellin antagonists that may preclude their use as seed treatments for these soil-dwelling insects. The crude extract of a bitter Hawkesbury watermelon containing cucurbitacin E-glycoside significantly inhibited germination of watermelon, squash, and tomato seeds. Although the germination of corn seed was not significantly inhibited, root elongation was inhibited by crude extracts, but not by high-performance liquid chromatography-purified cucurbitacin E-glycoside. Therefore, the effects of the major components in the bitter watermelon extract (e.g., sugars) on seed germination and root elongation were determined. Pure sugars (glucose and fructose), at concentrations found in watermelon extract, mimicked the inhibition of seed germination and root elongation seen with the crude bitter Hawkesbury watermelon extract.

14969513,"A simple, specific, and rapid analytical method for determining seven largely used carbamate insecticides in tomato, spinach, lettuce, zucchini, pear, and apple is here presented. This method is based on the matrix solid-phase dispersion technique, with heated water as extractant followed by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) equipped with a single quadrupole and an electrospray ion source. Target compounds were extracted from the vegetal matrixes by water heated at 50 degrees C. After acidification and filtration, 0.25 mL of any aqueous extract was injected in the LC column. MS data acquisition was performed in the selected ion monitoring mode, selecting three ions for each target compound. Heated water appeared to be an excellent extractant because recovery data ranged between 76 (carbaryl in spinach) and 99% (pirimicarb in spinach), with RSDs not larger than 10%. Using trimethacarb (an obsolete carbamate insecticide) as a surrogate internal standard, the accuracy of the analysis varied between 84 and 110%, with RSDs not larger than 9%. On the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, limits of quantification were estimated to range between 2 (pirimicarb) and 10 ppb (oxamyl) and were not influenced by the type of matrix. When trying to fractionate analytes by using a short chromatographic run time, marked weakening of the ion signals for oxamyl, methomyl, and aldicarb were observed.

We designed a study to examine changes in plasma and buccal mucosal cell (BMC) lycopene concentrations in healthy adults consuming standard daily servings of processed tomato products: spaghetti sauce, tomato soup, or vegetable juice. Thirty-six healthy subjects consumed a lycopene-free diet for 2 wk and were then assigned to one of three (n = 12) intervention groups consuming daily, single servings of sauce (21 mg lycopene per (1/2) cup), soup (12 mg lycopene per 1 cup), or juice (17 mg lycopene per 8 oz) for 4 wk. Fasting blood and BMC samples were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis for carotenoids and lycopene isomers. Total plasma lycopene concentrations (Mean +/- SEM) decreased from 1.05 +/- 0.07 to 0.54 +/- 0.05 micromol/l (49%, P < 0.0001) during the 2-wk washout period. Following intervention, plasma lycopene concentrations increased significantly for those consuming sauce, soup, and juice (compared with washout baseline) to 2.08 (192%, P < 0.0001), 0.91 (122%, P < 0.0001), and 0.99 (92%, P < 0.0001) micromol/l, respectively. Plasma isomer concentrations show a 61:39 ratio of cis:all-trans at the start of the study. During the 2-wk washout the decrease in plasma all-trans-lycopene was greater than that for pooled cis isomers (70:30 cis:trans ratio, P < 0.001). After 2 wk of dietary intervention isomer ratios returned to those observed at the start of the study. Total BMC lycopene concentrations did not significantly change during the brief washout. During the 4-wk intervention period, BMC total lycopene concentrations increased (P < 0.005) by 165, 42, and 48% nmol/mg protein for those consuming sauce, soup, and juice, respectively. This study demonstrates that plasma lycopene decreases by 50% after approximately 2 wk on a lycopene-free diet with a decrease in the ratio of all-trans compared with cis isomers.

12424324,"Recent epidemiological studies have suggested that the consumption of tomatoes and tomato-based food products reduce the risk of prostate cancer in humans. This protective effect has been attributed to carotenoids, which are one of the major classes of phytochemicals in this fruit. The most abundant carotenoid in tomato is lycopene, followed by phytoene, phytofluene, zeta-carotene, gamma-carotene, beta-carotene, neurosporene, and lutein. The distribution of lycopene and related carotenoids in tomatoes and tomato-based food products has been determined by extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-UV/Visible photodiode array detection. Detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of human serum, milk, and organs, particularly prostate, have revealed the presence of all the aforementioned carotenoids in biologically significant concentrations. Two oxidative metabolites of lycopene, 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diols A and B, which are only present in tomatoes in extremely low concentrations, have been isolated and identified in human serum, milk, organs (liver, lung, breast, liver, prostate, colon) and skin. Carotenoids may also play an important role in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, and other blinding disorders. Among 25 dietary carotenoids and nine metabolites routinely found in human serum, mainly (3R,3'R,6'R)-lutein, (3R,3'R)-zeaxanthin, lycopene, and their metabolites were detected in ocular tissues. In this review we identified and quantified the complete spectrum of carotenoids from pooled human retinal pigment epithelium, ciliary body, iris, lens, and in the uveal tract and in other tissues of the human eye to gain a better insight into the metabolic pathways of ocular carotenoids. Although (3R,3'R,6'R)-lutein, (3R,3'R)-zeaxanthin, and their metabolites constitute the major carotenoids in human ocular tissues, lycopene and a wide range of dietary carotenoids have been detected in high concentrations in ciliary body and retinal pigment epithelium. The possible role of lycopene and other dietary carotenoids in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration and other eye diseases is discussed.","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)","['D016588', 'D000975', 'D002338', 'D004032', 'D005123', 'D006801', 'D018551', 'D008895', 'D015394', 'D010084']","['Anticarcinogenic Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Carotenoids', 'Diet', 'Eye', 'Humans', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Milk, Human', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidation-Reduction']","Chemistry, distribution, and metabolism of tomato carotenoids and their impact on human health.","['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12424324,2002
12358437,"Tomatoes, a major food source for humans, accumulate a variety of secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds, phytoalexins, protease inhibitors, and glycoalkaloids. These metabolites protect against adverse effects of hosts of predators including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and insects. Because glycoalkaloids are reported to be involved in host-plant resistance, on the one hand, and to have a variety of pharmacological and nutritional properties in animals and humans, on the other, a need exists to develop a better understanding of the role of these compounds both in the plant and in the diet. To contribute to this effort, this integrated review presents data on the history, composition, and nutrition of tomatoes, with special focus on the assessment of the chemistry, analysis, composition, nutrition, microbiology, and pharmacology of the tomato glycoalkaloids comprising alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine; their content in different parts of the tomato plant, in processed tomato products, and in wild and transgenic tomatoes; their biosynthesis, inheritance, metabolism, and catabolism; plant-microbe relationships with fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects, and worms; interactions with ergosterol and cholesterol; disruption of cell membranes; tomatine-induced tomatinases, pantothenate synthetase, steroid hydroxylases, and cytokines; and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Also covered are tomato-human pathogen relationships and tomatine-induced lowering of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides and enhancement of the immune system. Further research needs in each of these areas are suggested. The overlapping aspects are discussed in terms of general concepts for a better understanding of the impact of tomato glycoalkaloids in the plant in general and in food in particular.

12228256,"The 1.6-A crystal structure of the covalent ketimine complex of apple 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase with the potent inhibitor l-aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) is described. ACC synthase catalyzes the committed step in the biosynthesis of ethylene, a plant hormone that is responsible for the initiation of fruit ripening and for regulating many other developmental processes. AVG is widely used in plant physiology studies to inhibit the activity of ACC synthase. The structural assignment is supported by the fact that the complex absorbs maximally at 341 nm. These results are not in accord with the recently reported crystal structure of the tomato ACC synthase AVG complex, which claims that the inhibitor only associates noncovalently. The rate constant for the association of AVG with apple ACC synthase was determined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry (2.1 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1)) and by the rate of loss of enzyme activity (1.1 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1)).

11767150,"Fungi of the genus Alternaria are parasitic on plants and other organic materials. A. alternata is a frequently occurring species of particular interest because it produces a number of mycotoxins, including alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), altenuene (ALT), altertoxins I, II, and III (ATX-I, -II, and -III), and L-tenuazonic acid (TeA). Cleanup procedures of analytical methods for foods and foodstuffs include solvent partition, generally used for TeA, and solid-phase extraction columns for AOH, AME, and ATX-I. These Alternaria mycotoxins have been determined by TLC, GC, and more usually LC, mainly with ultraviolet detection, although fluorescence and electrochemical detection have also been used for Alternaria toxins other than TeA. A Zn2+ salt is usually added to the LC mobile phase for TeA. Recently, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and electrospray LC/MS and LC-MS/MS have been applied to the determination and confirmation of AOH and AME in apple juice and other fruit beverages at sub ng/mL levels. Natural occurrences of AOH, AME, and in some cases other Alternaria toxins have been reported in various fruits, including tomatoes, olives, mandarins, melons, peppers, apples, and raspberries.

11599982,"Dithiocarbamates are a class of fungicides extensively used in many crops worldwide. The current residue definition of dithiocarbamates in food for compliance with maximum residue limits, at national and international levels, is total residues arising from the use of any or each dithiocarbamate fungicide, determined as CS(2). The analytical method most frequently used to analyze dithiocarbamate residues in food for monitoring purposes was proposed more than 30 years ago. In this method, total dithiocarbamates are decomposed to CS(2), which is purified and reacted with a cupric reagent. The yellow complex formed is quantified by spectrophotometry. In this paper, a new reaction system for the purification and complexation of CS(2) is proposed. The new system is less fragile than the traditional design, is easier to assemble, and allows for a higher sample throughput, in addition to being of low cost. Recovery of added mancozeb, thiram, or ziram (0.15-8.0 mg/kg) in rice, beans, apple, banana, orange, papaya, tomato, cucumber, and potato ranged from 82 to 120%, with relative standard deviations from 0 to 10% (n = 3 or 5).

The total flavonol content of the different varieties of tomato that were analyzed varied from 1.3 to 22.2 microgram/g of fresh weight (fw). Smaller cherry tomato fruits originating from warm sunny climates, such as Spain and Israel, were found to contain the highest concentration of flavonols. Among the tomato-based products investigated, tomato juice and tomato purée were rich in flavonols, containing 14-16 microgram/mL and 70 microgram/g fw, respectively. In contrast to fresh tomatoes, most tomato-based products contained significant amounts of free flavonols.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002851', 'D005419', 'D044948', 'D018551', 'D012431', 'D012621']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flavonoids', 'Flavonols', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Rutin', 'Seasons']",Occurrence of flavonols in tomatoes and tomato-based products.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10898604,2000
10889252,"Suspension-cultured cells of azuki bean (Vigna angularis) as well as the original root tissues were hypersensitive to Cd (<10 microM). Repeated subculturings with a sublethal level of Cd (1-10 microM) did not affect the subsequent response of cells to inhibitory levels of Cd (10-100 microM). The azuki bean cells challenged to Cd did not contain phytochelatin (PC) peptides, unlike tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) cells that have a substantial tolerance to Cd (>100 microM). Both of the cell suspensions contained a similar level of reduced glutathione (GSH) when grown in the absence of Cd. Externally applied GSH to azuki bean cells recovered neither Cd tolerance nor PC synthesis of the cells. Furthermore, enzyme assays in vitro revealed that the protein extracts of azuki bean cells had no activity converting GSH to PCs, unlike tomato. These results suggest that azuki bean cells are lacking in the PC synthase activity per se, hence being Cd hypersensitive. We concluded that the PC synthase has an important role in Cd tolerance of suspension-cultured cells.",Plant physiology,"['D019881', 'D019187', 'D002470', 'D002478', 'D002851', 'D007887', 'D005978', 'D008667', 'D054811', 'D010940', 'D018517', 'D010946', 'D013431']","['Aminoacyltransferases', 'Cadmium Compounds', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fabaceae', 'Glutathione', 'Metalloproteins', 'Phytochelatins', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Sulfates']",Azuki bean cells are hypersensitive to cadmium and do not synthesize phytochelatins.,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000096', None, 'Q000096', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000378']","['metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'biosynthesis', None, 'biosynthesis', 'enzymology', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10889252,2000

Its content in vitamins, minerals and chemical composition were evaluated in its canned presentation in tomato sauce. Samples proceeded from 3 fishery areas of the Mexican Pacific: (L1) Baja California Sur, (L2) Sonora and (L3) Sinaloa. The proximal chemical analysis was carried out by the AOAC methods; mineral content (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb) was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and vitamins A, B1, B2 and niacin were quantified by HPLC. Results showed a high moisture content from 69 to 82%, ether extract ranged between 7.8% (L2) and 10.2% (L3) and crude protein content between 10.6% (L3) and 14.6% (L1). Vitamin A (IU/100 g) was similar for all samples: L1 (63-66); thiamin (mg/100 g) was high in L1 (0.13) and low in L3 (0.09); riboflavin was high in L1 (0.15) and showed values of 0.13 for both L2 and L3; niacin content was high in all samples: L1 (2.24), L2 (1.48) and L3 (1.75). Minerals were abundant (mg/100 g) in Na, K, and P; L1 showed a great variation for Na (363-636) compared with L2 and L3 (250); K was very variable among the samples: L1 (597), L2 (100) and L3 (57). Phosphorous and magnesium had small variations: P (229, 243 and 212) and Mg (28, 23 and 23) for L1, L2 and L3.

9237940,"The pharmacokinetics of dietary capsanthin was measured in four male volunteers to assess the bioavailability of oxygenated carotenoids (xanthophylls). Capsanthin was used because this carotenoid was not detected in the men's plasma before ingestion of paprika juice. Supplementing capsanthin-rich paprika juice for 1 wk (equivalent to three doses of 5.4 micromol capsanthin/d; 16.2 micromol/d), the level of capsanthin reached a plateau (0.10-0.12 micromol/L) between d 2 and 7 and was not detectable by d 16. Capsanthin was distributed in the plasma lipoproteins (VLDL, 13 +/- 3%; LDL , 44 +/- 3%; HDL, 43 +/- 3%) at the end of the experiment. In a separate experiment involving the single ingestion of paprika juice (equivalent to 34.2 micromol capsanthin) in the same men, the plasma concentration of capsanthin ranged from 0.10 to 0.29 micromol/L at 8 h after ingestion. In contrast, the elevation of the plasma concentration of an acyclic hydrocarbon carotenoid, lycopene, by a single ingestion of tomato soup (equivalent to 186.3 micromol lycopene) in the same subjects was minimal (0.02-0.06 micromol/L). The areas under the curves (AUC) for capsanthin between 0 and 74 h and for lycopene between 0 and 72 h were 4.68 +/- 1.22 and 0.81 +/- 0.17(micromol.h)/L, respectively. The half-lives (t1/2) were calculated to be 20.1 +/- 1.3 and 222 +/- 15 h for capsanthin and lycopene, respectively. We conclude that the clearance of capsanthin is much faster than that of lycopene, although capsanthin is transported into plasma lipoproteins in larger amounts. This polar carotenoid may be metabolized in the human body more rapidly than lycopene.

9129299,"Ethylenethiourea (ETU) is a decomposition product from ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamates (EBDCs), the most widely used class of fungicides in the world. ETU has been classified as a possible human carcinogen. The maximum permitted residue level (MRL) in the European Union was set at 0.05 ppm. Gas chromatographic determination of ETU can be achieved only after derivatization. ETU is extracted from food samples and cleaned up by a combination of two-step derivatization and liquid-liquid partitioning. In the first step, ETU is derivatized with benzyl chloride to form S-benzyl ETU, which is then trifluoroacetylated to form the final product, which is amenable to GC. The determination is carried out with capillary gas chromatography using electron-capture (ECD) and nitrogen-phosphorus detection (NPD) as selective detection methods in parallel. The responses of ECD and NPD were found to be of the same order of magnitude. Therefore, the parallel response was found to be a useful criterion for peak identification down to the limit of detection. Reproducibility of the two-step derivatization of ETU to form trifluoroacetylated S-benzyl ETU was found to be satisfactory. The recoveries from apple, pear, tomato and a common baby food, at various concentration levels, were found to be between 82-92%, with a limit of detection of less than 1 ppb. Commercial samples, submitted for routine monitoring of dithiocarbamates (DTC) were also monitored in our laboratory for the presence of ETU. Four of the twenty samples found positive for DTC were also found to be contaminated with ETU in the range of 0.01 to 0.37 ppm. Three of these food samples were found to contain ETU residues above the MRL of 0.05, while those food samples containing DTC residues between 0.2 and 0.8 ppm were all below the MRL of DTC. No relation exists between the DTC residues concentration and the level of ETU. The screening data were further confirmed by electron impact mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring mode.

8896894,"An evaluation of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study has detected a lower prostate cancer risk associated with the greater consumption of tomatoes and related food products. Tomatoes are the primary dietary source of lycopene, a non-provitamin A carotenoid with potent antioxidant activity. Our goal was to define the concentrations of lycopene, other carotenoids, and retinol in paired benign and malignant prostate tissue from 25 men, ages 53 to 74, undergoing prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. The concentrations of specific carotenoids in the benign and malignant prostate tissue from the same subject are highly correlated. Lycopene and all-trans beta-carotene are the predominant carotenoids observed, with means +/- SE of 0.80 +/- 0.08 nmol/g and 0.54 +/- 0.09, respectively. Lycopene concentrations range from 0 to 2.58 nmol/g, and all-trans beta-carotene concentrations range from 0.09 to 1.70 nmol/g. The 9-cis beta-carotene isomer, alpha-carotene, lutein, alpha-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and beta-cryptoxanthin are consistently detectable in prostate tissue. No significant correlations between the concentration of lycopene and the concentrations of any other carotenoid are observed. In contrast, strong correlations between prostate beta-carotene and alpha-carotene are noted (correlation coefficient, 0.88; P < 0.0001), as are correlations between several other carotenoid pairs, which reflects their similar dietary origins. Mean vitamin A concentration in the prostate is 1.52 nmol/g, with a range of 0.71 to 3.30 nmol/g. We further evaluated tomato-based food products, serum, and prostate tissue for the presence of geometric lycopene isomers using high-performance liquid chromatography with a polymeric C30 reversed phase column. All-trans lycopene accounts for 79 to 91% and cis lycopene isomers for 9 to 21% of total lycopene in tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato soup. Lycopene concentrations in the serum of men range between 0.60 and 1.9 nmol/ml, with 27 to 42% all-trans lycopene and 58 to 73% cis-isomers distributed among 12 to 13 peaks, depending upon their chromatographic resolution. In striking contrast with foods, all-trans lycopene accounts for only 12 to 21% and cis isomers for 79 to 88% of total lycopene in benign or malignant prostate tissues. cis Isomers of lycopene within the prostate are distributed among 14 to 18 peaks. We conclude that a diverse array of carotenoids are found in the human prostate with significant intra-individual variation. The presence of lycopene in the prostate at concentrations that are biologically active in laboratory studies supports the hypothesis that lycopene may have direct effects within the prostate and contribute to the reduced prostate cancer risk associated with the reduced prostate cancer risk associated with the consumption of tomato-based foods. The future identification and characterization of geometric lycopene isomers may lead to the development of novel agents for chemoprevention studies.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology","['D000368', 'D016588', 'D000975', 'D015415', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D004032', 'D006801', 'D000077276', 'D008297', 'D008875', 'D011467', 'D011471', 'D012307', 'D014801', 'D019207']","['Aged', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Biomarkers', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diet', 'Humans', 'Lycopene', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamin A', 'beta Carotene']","cis-trans lycopene isomers, carotenoids, and retinol in the human prostate.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8896894,1997

24186277,"1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (EC 4.4.1.14) purified from apple (Malus sylvestris Mill.) fruit was subjected to trypsin digestion. Following separation by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, ten tryptic peptides were sequenced. Based on the sequences of three tryptic peptides, three sets of mixed oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and used to screen a plasmid cDNA library prepared from poly(A)(+) RNA of ripe apple fruit. A 1.5-kb (kilobase) cDNA clone which hybridized to all three probes were isolated. The clone contained an open reading frame of 1214 base pairs (bp) encoding a sequence of 404 amino acids. While the polyadenine tail at the 3'-end was intact, it lacked a portion of sequence at the 5'-end. Using the RNA-based polymerase chain reaction, an additional sequence of 148 bp was obtained at the 5'-end. Thus, 1362 bp were sequenced and they encode 454 amino acids. The deduced amino-acid sequence contained peptide sequences corresponding to all ten tryptic fragments, confirming the identity of the cDNA clone. Comparison of the deduced amino-acid sequence between ACC synthase from apple fruit and those from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and winter squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) fruits demonstrated the presence of seven highly conserved regions, including the previously identified region for the active site. The size of the translation product of ACC-synthase mRNA was similar to that of the mature protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), indicating that apple ACC-synthase undergoes only minor, if any, post-translational proteolytic processing. Analysis of ACC-synthase mRNA by in-vitro translation-immunoprecipitation, and by Northern blotting indicates that the ACC-synthase mRNA was undetectable in unripe fruit, but was accumulated massively during the ripening proccess. These data demonstrate that the expression of the ACC-synthase gene is developmentally regulated.

3105349,"A chiral phase HPLC method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the positional and optical isomers of the lipoxygenase-derived hydroxypolyenoic fatty acids. With a Bakerbond chiral phase HPLC column (dinitrobenzoyl phenylglycine as chiral phase) the positional and optical isomers of the reduced dioxygenation products (by triphenylphosphine or borohydride) of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid were separated after methylation of the carboxylic groups. No cumbersome chemical derivatization such as conversion to a diastereomer was necessary. As compared with the methods used up till now chiral phase HPLC proved to be simpler and more sensitive. About 10 pmol of hydroxy fatty acids suffice for an analysis. The chiral phase HPLC can be used for the preparative separation of the optical antipodes of the lipoxygenase products. An optical purity of more than 90% can be reached in one preparative run. The method was applied to the determination of the stereochemistry of the dioxygenation products of polyenoic fatty acids formed by the lipoxygenases from soybeans, reticulocytes, pea seeds (isoenzyme I and II), tomato fruits, by the quasilipoxygenase activity of hemoglobin, and by the methylene blue-mediated photooxidation of arachidonic acid.",Analytical biochemistry,"['D000818', 'D002850', 'D002851', 'D005231', 'D006880', 'D006893', 'D007527', 'D008084', 'D010944', 'D012156', 'D013237', 'D014908']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Hydroxy Acids', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids', 'Isoenzymes', 'Lipoxygenase', 'Plants', 'Reticulocytes', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Triticum']",Analysis of the stereochemistry of lipoxygenase-derived hydroxypolyenoic fatty acids by means of chiral phase high-pressure liquid chromatography.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000302', 'Q000302', 'Q000302', 'Q000378', 'Q000097', 'Q000201', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000201']","[None, 'methods', 'methods', 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', 'metabolism', 'blood', 'enzymology', 'enzymology', None, 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3105349,1987

7118782,"Dry and wet ashing methods have been used in the analysis of garden vegetables for Pb. The reliability of wet ashing has been verified by the method of standard additions. Comparison of dry and wet ashing showed good agreement for a variety of garden vegetables. Sample size was more strictly limited for the wet-ashed samples, which led to lower sensitivity. Vegetable samples are commonly analyzed for a number of trace elements, which introduces additional constraints on sample preparation, notably because of Cd loss on dry ashing. Pretreatment with HNO3/H2SO4 ash aid eliminated Cd loss. Reliability of dry ashing with pretreatment was shown with NBS SRM Orchard Leaves, Pine Needles, Spinach, and Tomato Leaves. The analysis was insensitive to ashing temperature in the range 480-625 degrees C. A practical detection limit for the method is about 2 ppm Pb, dry weight basis (DWB). Care must be exercised to avoid contamination of the sample with lead at this level by improper handling. Segregation and acid washing of glassware and protection of the sample from contact with any object not demonstrably clean was necessary. No evidence was found of Pb contamination at this level from tap water washing of fresh vegetables, forced-air oven drying, or grinding with mortar and pestle. No special clean room facilities or laboratory air purification measures were used. Sensitivity was increased 3-fold by extraction with dithizone in CHCl3 followed by back-extraction into dilute HCl. Detection limits were not improved, however, because of variation in the extraction results. The instrumental method for assessing effective correction for back-ground absorbance showed adequate compensation, although comparison of direct and extractive determinations showed a small but significant difference between the methods of about 1 ppm Pb (DWB).",Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,"['D006358', 'D007854', 'D013054', 'D014675']","['Hot Temperature', 'Lead', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Vegetables']",Sample preparation in determination of lead in garden vegetables by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7118782,1982

The enzyme was inhibited by cyanide but not by chloroform-ethanol, and appears to contain zinc and lesser amounts of copper. SOD-activity levels were high in immature green fruits, declined to a minimum in the mature-green and breaker stages known to be most susceptible to sunscald damage, increased again until the fruits were pink, and finally decreased through the red-ripe and overripe stages to the level of the mature-green fruit. When tolerance to sunscald damage was induced in mature-green fruits by controlled temperature treatment and samples of the fruits were challenged at various times during this process with a combined heat-and-light treatment known to cause sunscald, SOD activity was found to be inversely related to the susceptibility of the fruit to sunscald damage. It is suggested that superoxide is involved in sunscald injury to tomatoes and that tolerance is acquired through increases in SOD activity. Possibly SOD acts as a general protective agent against photodynamic damage to green tissues in plants that have become conditioned as the result of normal diurnal temperature fluctuations.

The levels of N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) in fried bacon and cooked-out bacon fats were also somewhat lower than those observed at the end of 1976, but the decrease may not be significant. Traces (mean, 1.5 micrograms/kg) of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) were detected in 21 of 22 samples of beers and ales.

The solubilized material was primarily polyuronide; smaller amounts of neutral sugar were released. Gel filtration chromatography indicated that an endopolygalacturonase was the only enzyme in the citrate extract able to hydrolyze isolated cell walls. However, this polygalacturonase in vitro did not lead to the substantial (40-60%) decrease in wall galactose which was observed in situ.
