35106614,"Analysis of the dipicolinic acid (DPA) released from Clostridium botulinum spores during thermal processing is crucial to obtaining a mechanistic understanding of the factors involved in spore heat resistance and related food safety applications. Here, we developed a novel mixed-mode liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for detection of the DPA released from C. botulinum type A, nonproteolytic types B and F strains, and nonpathogenic surrogate Clostridium sporogenes PA3679 spores. DPA was retained on a mixed-mode C18/anion exchange column and was detected using electrospray ionization (ESI) positive mode within a 4-min analysis time. The intraday and interday precision (%CV) was 1.94-3.46% and 4.04-8.28%, respectively. Matrix effects were minimal across proteolytic type A Giorgio-A, nonproteolytic types QC-B and 202-F, and C. sporogenes PA3679 spore suspensions (90.1-114% of spiked DPA concentrations). DPA recovery in carrot juice and beef broth ranged from 105 to 118%, indicating limited matrix effects of these food products. Experiments that assessed the DPA released from Giorgio-A spores over the course of a 5-min thermal treatment at 108 °C found a significant correlation (R = 0.907; P < 0.05) between the log reduction of spores and amount of DPA released. This mixed-mode LC-MS/MS method provides a means for rapid detection of DPA released from C. botulinum spores during thermal processing and has the potential to be used for experiments in the field of food safety that assess the thermal resistance characteristics of various C. botulinum spore types.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002853', 'D003014', 'D006358', 'D010848', 'D013171', 'D053719']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Clostridium botulinum', 'Hot Temperature', 'Picolinic Acids', 'Spores, Bacterial', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Rapid detection and quantitation of dipicolinic acid from Clostridium botulinum spores using mixed-mode liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35106614,2022

DHCP attracts attention due to its cytotoxicity as well as potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its effects and the difficulty of its identification in food are mediated in part by the formation of Michael adducts of DHCP with amino acids. The results revealed that DHCP reacted efficiently with cysteine and glutathione, and to a lesser extent with histidine.

These by-products represent an interesting and economical source of added value components with potential functionalities and/or bioactivities, which might be explored for industrial purposes, encouraging and promoting the circular economy concept. In this context, the current work aimed to evaluate the fatty acids (FAs) profile using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), as well as the determination of related health lipid indices (e.g., atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI)) as a powerful strategy to investigate the potential applications of different agri-food by-products for human nutrition and animal feeding. This work results showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the predominant group in grape pomace (72.7%), grape bunches (54.3%), and brewer's spent grain (BSG, 59.0%), whereas carrot peels are dominated by monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs, 47.3%), and grape stems (46.2%), lees (from 50.8 to 74.1%), and potato peels (77.2%) by saturated fatty acids (SFAs). These findings represent a scientific basis for exploring the nutritional properties of agri-food by-products. Special attention should be given to grape pomace, grape bunches, and BSG since they have a high content of PUFAs (from 54.3 to 72.7%) and lower AI (from 0.11 to 0.38) and TI (from 0.30 to 0.56) indexes, suggesting their potential to provide a variety of health benefits against cardiovascular diseases including well-established hypotriglyceridemia and anti-inflammatory effects, products to which they are added.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Evaluation of Fatty Acids Profile as a Useful Tool towards Valorization of By-Products of Agri-Food Industry.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34829147,2021

34203867,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studying and exploring the potential health benefits of foods, mainly from vegetables and fruits from regular intake. The presence of secondary metabolites, namely polyphenols, carotenoids and terpenes, in certain food matrices seems to contribute to their functional properties, expressed through an increased prevention in the development of certain chronic diseases, namely coronary heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and diabetes. However, some foods' volatile secondary metabolites also present important bioactive properties, although this is a poorly scientifically explored field. In this context, and in order to explore the potential bioactivity of volatile metabolites in different vegetables and fruits from regular consumption, the volatile composition was established using a green extraction technique, solid phase microextraction in headspace mode (HS-SPME), combined with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 320 volatile metabolites, comprising 51 terpenic compounds, 45 organosulfur compounds, 31 aldehydes, 37 esters, 29 ketones, 28 alcohols, 23 furanic compounds, 22 hydrocarbons, 19 benzene compounds, 13 nitrogenous compounds, 9 carboxylic acids, 7 ethers, 4 halogenated compounds and 3 naphthalene derivatives, were positively identified. Each investigated fruit and vegetable showed a specific volatile metabolomic profile. The obtained results revealed that terpenic compounds, to which are associated antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities, are the most predominant chemical family in beetroot (61%), orange carrot (58%) and white carrot (61%), while organosulfur compounds (antiviral activity) are dominant in onion, garlic and watercress.

34069856,"Food safety issues caused by pesticide residue have exerted far-reaching impacts on human daily life, yet the available detection methods normally focus on surface residue rather than pesticide penetration to the internal area of foods. Herein, we demonstrated gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-immersed paper imprinting mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) for monitoring pesticide migration behaviors in various fruits and vegetables (i.e., apple, cucumber, pepper, plum, carrot, and strawberry). By manually stamping food tissues onto AuNP-immersed paper, this method affords the spatiotemporal visualization of insecticides and fungicides within fruits and vegetables, avoiding tedious and time-consuming sample preparation. Using the established MSI platform, we can track the migration of insecticides and fungicides into the inner region of foods. The results revealed that both the octanol-water partition coefficient of pesticides and water content of garden stuffs could influence the discrepancy in the migration speed of pesticides into food kernels. Taken together, this nanopaper imprinting MSI is poised to be a powerful tool because of its simplicity, rapidity, and easy operation, offering the potential to facilitate further applications in food analysis. Moreover, new perspectives are given to provide guidelines for the rational design of novel pesticide candidates, reducing the risk of food safety issues caused by pesticide residue.","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Spatiotemporal Visualization of Insecticides and Fungicides within Fruits and Vegetables Using Gold Nanoparticle-Immersed Paper Imprinting Mass Spectrometry Imaging.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069856,2021

After enzymatic digestion with trypsin, few microliters of extract were analyzed by direct infusion in positive ion mode. A custom-made non-redundant fennel-specific proteome database was derived from the well-known NCBI database; additional proteins belonging to recognized allergenic sources (celery, carrot, parsley, birch, and mugwort) were also included in our database, since patients hypersensitive to these plants could also suffer from fennel allergy. The peptide sequence of each protein from that derived list was theoretically sequenced to produce calculated m/z lists of possible m/z ions after tryptic digestions. Then, by using a home-made Matlab algorithm, those lists were matched with the experimental FT-ICR mass spectrum of the fennel peptide mixture. Finally, Peptide Mass Fingerprint searches confirmed the presence of the matched proteins inside the fennel extract with a total of 70 proteins (61 fennel specific and 9 allergenic proteins).","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D017357', 'D030001', 'D005583', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D010449']","['Cyclotrons', 'Foeniculum', 'Fourier Analysis', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Peptide Mapping']",Investigation of fennel protein extracts by shot-gun Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509486,2021

We used acetylcholinesterase to catalytically convert acetylthiocholine into thiocholine. In turn, by competitive binding to the AgNPs, the produced thiocholine displaces AgNPs from the GQDs and thus induces fluorescence recovery. However, OP analytes inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase and, in so doing, retain the silver-graphene nanoparticle complex and fluorescence quenching. The degree of quenching is proportional to the concentration of OPs; the detection limit is as low as 0.017 μg/L. The ultraviolet-visible absorption of GQDs/AgNPs at 390 nm decreases-because of AgNP aggregation that occurs after desorption from the GQDs-and the absorbance is linearly proportional to the OP concentration.

Carrot seed essential oil was extracted using hydrodistillation method and extracts were prepared using different solvents viz. dichloromethane, hexane, and methanol. The pure compounds daucene, carotol, and daucol were isolated using column chromatography and derivatized using different reagents. The study demonstrated that antifungal potential of all tested compounds varied in a dose dependent manner. Structure activity relationship of isolated and derivatized compounds showed that polar moieties possessed more antifungal potential as compared to non-polar moieties. The results suggested that carrot seed methanol extract and carotol possessed strong antifungal potential as compared to other components tested. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Phytopathogenic fungi are the major problems causing harmful damage to the rice crop. Only available control of these diseases is synthetic fungicides but their repeated use led to serious environmental issues, residual toxicity, and development of resistance. Therefore, it's better to find some natural alternatives. The current study was conducted to evaluate in vitro antifungal potential of carrot seed essential oil, its constituents and extracts against phytopathogenic fungi of rice. The methanol extract and carotol possessed highest antifungal potential which might be due to their polar nature.

We evaluated the impact of the matrix effects on quantification of six neonicotinoid pesticides, acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam, in food by using deuterated internal standards. The calibration curves for each pesticide were obtained by using matrix-free and matrix-matched calibration solutions with blank brown rice, carrot, and green onion extracts. For brown rice and carrot, the matrix effects were not observed. In contrast, the slopes of calibration curves for each pesticide were influenced by presence of green onion extracts in calibration solutions (variability of the slopes was 4-9%), because the ratios of peak area for native pesticide to those for internal standards were influenced by matrix. The spike-and-recovery test with green onion was also performed. The analytical values obtained by using matrix-free calibration solution were biased from the spiked concentration, whereas those obtained by using matrix-matched calibration solution were comparable to the spiked concentration.

31065708,"Yellow and orange egg yolks are good sources of xanthophyll carotenoids, consumption of which is associated with health benefits, such as cancer prevention, eye health, and bone health. Industrial feed fortificants used to improve egg yolk color and carotenoid concentration typically are derived from marigold flowers. Green leafy vegetables are also concentrated sources of the xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin (L+Z), but they have not been rigorously evaluated in laying hen feeds as a yolk colorant. The addition of food manufacturing byproducts, including carrot leaves, to animal feed is a promoted method of improving animal nutrition. The ability of dehydrated carrot leaves to improve egg yolk color and L+Z concentration was evaluated by feeding laying hens (n = 40) white maize-based feeds fortified with 2 different dehydrated carrot leaves, marigold as a positive control, or no fortificant as a negative control for 28 D. After a 7-D washout period, the hens were separated into 4 groups, and eggs were collected every other day. Yolks were analyzed by using a portable colorimeter to define the color space and by ultra-performance liquid chromatography to determine the carotenoid profile. Carotenoid concentration rapidly declined from day 0 to 8, confirming adequate washout conditions. The white maize negative control (WM) day 28 lutein concentration (3.59 ± 0.51 nmol/g) was significantly less than orange-carrot leaf-treated (OCL) (5.34 ± 0.36 nmol/g) and red-carrot leaf-treated hens (RCL) (5.92 ± 1.00 nmol/g) in addition to the marigold-treated hens (MG). However, MG was significantly higher than both leaf-treated groups. From day 8 (3.93 ± 0.74 nmol/g) to 28 (9.32 ± 1.66 nmol/g), MG had the largest increase in lutein and was the only treatment to surpass day 0 initial concentrations (8.50 ± 1.64 nmol/g).

30993530,"Metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic acid hydroxy stearic acid (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi).

They are extracted from different sources, but black carrot has higher anthocyanin content compared with common fruits and vegetables. Here, we study alcoholic anthocyanin extracts from black carrot to enhance their stability. The objective of our research is to determine if microencapsulation with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) is a feasible option for preventing black carrot anthocyanin degradation. Extraction solvents were solutions of (1) ethanol/acetic acid and (2) ethanol/citric acid. Samples were purified through a resin column and microencapsulated using TEOS. Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of samples were obtained, and degradation studies were performed under different conditions of UV radiation, pH and temperature. Antioxidant activity was evaluated with radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging and electrochemical cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC). Color evaluation on food models were performed with CIE Lab at the beginning of experiments and after 25 days of storage. Results indicate that the more stable extracts against pH media changes are samples obtained with ethanol/acetic acid solution as extraction solvent. Extract purification through resin and TEOS microencapsulation had no significant effect on extract stability.

Moreover, α- and β-carotene were found to accumulate in both tissues. Then, using Trinity assembly into contigs and mapped back to contigs, these reads were assembled to 56,267 and 62,427 leaf and root unigenes, respectively, after Ns removal and paired-end extension. In addition, a total of 18,354 DEGs were found between the carrot leaf and root unigenes, and 99 of these DEGs were found to be involved in carotenoid biosynthesis as revealed by integrated function annotation.

Using the atomic absorption spectrometry method, concentrations of nine heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were measured in the selected samples. The results showed that, in five out of 28 samples analysed, six concentrations exceeded the maximum levels provided for in the regulations: five for Pb and one for Cd. Maximum regulated levels for Pb were exceeded in two samples of red potato, two samples of common bean, and one sample of carrot (17.9 %), and for Cd in a sample of red potato (3.6 %). In conclusion, the cause of the overstepping of the maximum levels for Pb and Cd in the vegetables analysed was most likely the contaminated soil.

This study aimed to investigate the polyphenol composition of black carrots. Particularly, the identification and quantification of phenolic compounds of the variety Deep Purple carrot (DPC), which presents a very dark color, was performed by HPLC-PDA and HPLC-ESI-MS(n) analyses. The separation of polyphenols from a DPC XAD-7 extract into an anthocyanin fraction (AF) and co-pigment fraction (CF; primarily phenolic acids) was carried out by membrane chromatography. Furthermore, possible anti-diabetic effects of the DPC XAD-7 extract and its AF and CF were determined. DPC samples (XAD-7, CF, and AF) inhibited α-amylase and α-glucosidase in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, DPC XAD-7 and chlorogenic acid, but not DPC CF and DPC AF, caused a moderate inhibition of intestinal glucose uptake in Caco-2 cells. However, DPC samples did not affect glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) activity. Overall, DPC exhibits an inhibitory effect on α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity and on cellular glucose uptake indicating potential anti-diabetic properties.

27196992,"Consumption of vegetables grown in arsenic (As)-contaminated soils is an important exposure route to the element for humans. The present study is focused on locally-grown, frequently-consumed vegetables, such as carrots (Daucus carota), beets (Beta vulgaris) and quinoa (Chenopodium) from the As-polluted Chiu Chiu area in Northern Chile. The latter region is affected both by As discharge from copper mining activity and natural As contamination, leading to a high As content in local food and water. For the selected vegetables, the following aspects were investigated: i) Their total As, Cu, Pb, Cr, Cd and Mn content; ii) Arsenic speciation in the edible part of the vegetables by liquid chromatography inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICPMS) analysis; iii) Arsenic bioaccessibility in the vegetables during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion; iv) Arsenic species present in the extracts obtained from in vitro gastrointestinal digestion; and v) Arsenic dietary exposure estimates for the assessment of the risk posed by the vegetables consumption. A significant degree of As contamination was found in the vegetables under study, their metal content having been compared with that of similar Spanish uncontaminated products. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion of the studied vegetables led to quantitative extraction of As from carrots and beets, whereas efficiency was about 40% for quinoa. For carrots, only As(III) and As(V) species were found, being their concentration levels similar. In the case of quinoa, around 85% of the element was present as As(V). For beets, inorganic As(V) and unknown overlapped As species (probably arsenosugars) were found. No significant transformation of the original As species was observed during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Arsenic dietary exposure values obtained for the three vegetables (0.017-0.021μg As person(-1)day(-1)) were much lower than the JFCFA's safety limit of 50μg As person(-1)day(-1). Therefore, no toxicological risk would be expected from the intake of these vegetables.

27187577,"The terrestrial slug Limax can learn to avoid the odor of some food (e.g., carrot juice) by the simultaneous presentation of an aversive stimulus (e.g., bitterness of quinidine). This type of associative memory critically depends on the higher olfactory center, the procerebrum in the central nervous system. The modulation of the local field potential (LFP) oscillation recorded on the procerebrum has been thought to reflect the information processing of the odor that elicits the behavioral change, such as avoidance of the aversively learned odor or approaching an attractive food's odor. Here we focused on octopamine, an important neuromodulator involved in learning and memory in invertebrates, and considered to be the invertebrate equivalent of noradrenaline. We identified a few octopaminergic neurons in the subesophageal and buccal ganglia, and a larger number near the procerebrum in the cerebral ganglia, using immunohistochmical staining and in situ hybridization of tyramine β-hydroxylase, an octopamine-synthesizing enzyme. Application of octopamine reduced the frequency of LFP oscillation in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was inhibited by preincubation with phentolamine. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed the presence of octopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline in the central nervous system. Unexpectedly, noradrenaline and adrenaline both accelerated the LFP oscillation, in contrast to octopamine. Our results suggest that octopamine and noradrenaline have distinct functions in olfactory information processing, in spite of their structural similarity. J. Comp.

FAMES were analyzed by gas chromatography-quadrupole time of flight (GC-QTOF) mass spectrometry. Triglycerides were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight (LC-QTOF) mass spectrometry. Petroselinic acid was the major fatty acid in all samples ranging from 57% of the total fatty acids in caraway up to 82% in fennel. All samples contained palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (C16:1n-9), stearic (C18:0), petroselinic (C18:1n-12), linoleic (C18:2n-6), linolinic (18:3n-3), and arachidic (C20:0) acids. TAG were analyzed using LC-QTOF for accurate mass identification and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MS/MS) techniques for regiospesific elucidation of the identified TAGs. Five major TAGs were detected in all samples but with different relative concentrations in all of the tested samples. Several other TAGs were detected as minor components and were present in some samples and absence in the others. Regiospecific analysis showed a non-random fatty acids distribution. Petroselinic acid was predominantly located at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions.

The present study focused on the changes in polyphenols from black carrot, peel, and pomace during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Total phenolic content (TPC), total monomeric anthocyanin content (TMAC), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were determined using spectrophotometric methods, whereas identification and quantification of polyphenols were carried out using UPLC-ESI-MS(E) and HPLC-DAD, respectively. TPC, TMAC, and TAC significantly decreased (23-82%) as a result of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Nevertheless, the amount of pomace anthocyanins released at all stages of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was higher than black carrot anthocyanins, suggesting that pomace may be a better source of bioaccessible anthocyanins.

The major staple diet in South Asia, rice, was chosen to study its interaction with UO2(2+), the active uranium species in water, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Highest uptake limit was checked by cooking rice at very high uranium concentration and it was found to be good scavenger of uranium. To gain insight into the mechanism of uptake, direct interaction of UO2(2+) with monosaccharides was also studied, using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry taking mannose as a model. The studies have been done with dissolved uranium salt, uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UO2(NO3)2·6H2O), as well as the leachate of a stable oxide of uranium, UO2(s), both of which exist as UO2(2+) in water. Among the eight different rice varieties investigated, Karnataka Ponni showed the maximum uranium uptake whereas unpolished Basmati rice showed the minimum. Interaction with other foodstuffs (potato, carrot, peas, kidney beans and lentils) with and without NaCl affected the extent of chemical interaction but was not consistent with the carbohydrate content. Uranium interaction with D-mannose monitored through ESI-MS, under optimized instrumental parameters, identified the peaks corresponding to uranyl adduct with mannose monomer, dimer and trimer and the species were confirmed by MS/MS studies. The product ion mass spectra showed peaks illustrating water loss from the parent ion as the collision energy was increased, an evidence for the strong interaction of uranium with mannose. This study would constitute the essential background for understanding interaction of uranium with various foods.

New molecularly imprinted polymer nanomicrospheres were synthesized by using typical structural analogue tolclofos-methyl as a dummy template via surface grafting polymerization on nanosilica. Then, these four pesticides in carrot and yacon were extracted and adsorbed using the imprinted nanomicrospheres and further determined by gas chromatography.

A greenhouse experiment was conducted to develop soil-plant transfer models to predict Pb concentrations in carrot (Daucus carota L.). Soil thresholds for food safety were then derived inversely using the prediction model in view of the maximum allowable limit for Pb in food. The 2 most important soil properties that influenced carrot Pb uptake factor (ratio of Pb concentration in carrot to that in soil) were soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC), as revealed by path analysis. Stepwise multiple linear regression models were based on soil properties and the pseudo total (aqua regia) or extractable (0.01 M CaCl2 and 0.005 M diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) soil Pb concentrations. Carrot Pb contents were best explained by the pseudo total soil Pb concentrations in combination with soil pH and CEC, with the percentage of variation explained being up to 93%.

The observed analytical values using isotope-labeled internal standards were more accurate for most target pesticides than that obtained using the external calibration method, but were still biased from the spiked concentrations when a matrix-free calibration solution was used for calibration. The respective calibration curves for each target pesticide were also prepared using matrix-free calibration solutions and matrix-matched calibration solutions with blank soybean extract. The intensity ratio of the peaks of most target pesticides to that of the corresponding isotope-labeled internal standards was influenced by the presence of the matrix in the calibration solution; therefore, the observed slope varied. The ratio was also influenced by the type of injection method (splitless or on-column).

24828980,"An atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source has been used to enhance the potential of gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry (MS) for screening and quantification purposes in pesticide residue analysis. A screening method developed in our laboratory for around 130 pesticides has been applied to fruit and vegetable samples, including strawberries, oranges, apples, carrots, lettuces, courgettes, red peppers, and tomatoes. Samples were analyzed together with quality control samples (at 0.05 mg/kg) for each matrix and for matrix-matched calibration standards. The screening strategy consisted in first rapid searching and detection, and then a refined identification step using the QTOF capabilities (MS(E) and accurate mass). Identification was based on the presence of one characteristic m/z ion (Q) obtained with the low collision energy function and at least one fragment ion (q) obtained with the high collision energy function, both with mass errors of less than 5 ppm, and an ion intensity ratio (q/Q) within the tolerances permitted. Following this strategy, 15 of 130 pesticides were identified in the samples. Afterwards, the quantitation capabilities were tested by performing a quantitative validation for those pesticides detected in the samples. To this aim, five matrices were selected (orange, apple, tomato, lettuce, and carrot) and spiked at two concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg), and quantification was done using matrix-matched calibration standards (relative responses versus triphenyl phosphate used as an internal standard). Acceptable average recoveries and relative standard deviations were obtained for many but not all pesticide-matrix combinations. These figures allowed us to perform a retrospective quantification of positives found in the screening without the need for additional analysis. Taking advantage of the accurate-mass full-spectrum data provided by QTOF MS, we searched for a higher number of compounds (up to 416 pesticides) in a second stage by performing extra data processing without any new sample injection. Several more pesticides were detected, confirmed, and/or tentatively identified when the reference standard was unavailable, illustrating in this way the potential of gas chromatography-QTOF MS to detect pesticides in addition to the ones targeted in quantitative analysis of pesticides in food matrices.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D001274', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D010573', 'D014675']","['Atmospheric Pressure', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Vegetables']",Screening and quantification of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables making use of gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828980,2015

24669707,"The raw extracts of six vegetables (tomato, green bean, shallot, broccoli, ginger and carrot) were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in full scan mode combined with NIST library search to confirm main matrix compounds. The effects of cleanup and adsorption mechanisms of primary secondary amine (PSA) , octadecylsilane (C18) and PSA + C18 on co-extractives were studied by the weight of evaporation residue for extracts before and after cleanup. The suitability of the two versions of QuEChERS method for sample preparation was evaluated for the extraction of 51 carbamate pesticides in the six vegetables. One of the QuEChERS methods was the original un-buffered method published in 2003, and the other was AOAC Official Method 2007.01 using acetate buffer. As a result, the best effects were obtained from using the combination of C18 and PSA for extract cleanup in vegetables. The acetate-buffered version was suitable for the determination of all pesticides except dioxacarb. Un-buffered QuEChERS method gave satisfactory results for determining dioxacarb. Based on these results, the suitable QuEChERS sample preparation method and liquid chromatography-positive electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry under the optimized conditions were applied to determine the 51 carbamate pesticide residues in six vegetables. The analytes were quantified by matrix-matched standard solution.

The uptake of cadmium and its accumulation by plants is dependent on various soil, plants and environmental factors. In order to identify soil properties with statistically significant influence on cadmium concentration in vegetables and to reduce the collection of data, time and costs, regression models can be applied. The main objective of this research was to develop regression models to predict the concentration of cadmium in 9-vegetable species: zucchini, tomato, cabbage, onion, potato, carrot, red beet, endive and chicory, based on soil properties. Soil samples were collected from 123 home gardens of the Municipality of Celje and 59 of these gardens were also included in vegetable sampling. The concentration of elements (e.g. arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc) in the samples was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Single (for cabbage, potato, red beet and chicory) and multiple (for tomato, onion, carrot and endive) linear regression models were developed. There was no statistically significant regression model for zucchini. The most significant parameter for the influencing the cadmium concentration in vegetables was the concentration of cadmium in soil. Other important soil properties were the content of organic matter, pH-value and the concentration of manganese. It was concluded that consuming carrots, red beets, endives, onions, potatoes and chicory which are grown in gardens with Cd concentrations (mgkg(-1) DW) above 2.4, 3.2, 6.3, 7.9, 8.3 and 10.9, respectively, might represent an important contribution to dietary Cd exposure.

To gain a general and comparative characterization of chromoplast proteins, this study performed proteomic analysis of chromoplasts from six carotenoid-rich crops: watermelon, tomato, carrot, orange cauliflower, red papaya, and red bell pepper. Stromal and membrane proteins of chromoplasts were separated by 1D gel electrophoresis and analysed using nLC-MS/MS. A total of 953-2262 proteins from chromoplasts of different crop species were identified. Approximately 60% of the identified proteins were predicted to be plastid localized. Functional classification using MapMan bins revealed large numbers of proteins involved in protein metabolism, transport, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and redox in chromoplasts from all six species. Seventeen core carotenoid metabolic enzymes were identified. Phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, ζ-carotene desaturase, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 were found in almost all crops, suggesting relative abundance of them among the carotenoid pathway enzymes. Chromoplasts from different crops contained abundant amounts of ATP synthase and adenine nucleotide translocator, which indicates an important role of ATP production and transport in chromoplast development. Distinctive abundant proteins were observed in chromoplast from different crops, including capsanthin/capsorubin synthase and fibrillins in pepper, superoxide dismutase in watermelon, carrot, and cauliflower, and glutathione-S-transferease in papaya.

The limit of detection based on three times the standard deviation of the blank was found to be 0.53 ng mL(-1) in original solution. Obtained sorption capacity for 1 g sorbent was 5.0 mg Pb. The linearity was maintained in the concentration range of 0.1-30.0 ng mL(-1) for the concentrated solution. Eight replicate determinations of 2.0 μg mL(-1) of lead in the final solution gave relative standard deviation of ±2.6 %.

It has been shown that such contaminants can be incorporated into crop plants. The metabolism of the bacteriostatic agents triclocarban, triclosan, and its transformation product methyl triclosan was investigated after their uptake into carrot cell cultures. A fast metabolization of triclosan was observed and eight so far unknown phase II metabolites, conjugates with saccharides, disaccharides, malonic acid, and sulfate, were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Triclocarban and methyl triclosan lack a phenolic group and remained unaltered in the cell cultures. Phase I metabolization was not observed for any of the compounds. All eight triclosan conjugates identified in the cell cultures were also detected in extracts of intact carrot plants cultivated on triclosan contaminated soils. Their total amount in the plants was assessed to exceed the amount of the triclosan itself by a factor of 5.

22964046,"This paper reports on the development and optimization of a modified Quick, Easy, Cheap Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) based extraction technique coupled with a clean-up dispersive-solid phase extraction (dSPE) as a new, reliable and powerful strategy to enhance the extraction efficiency of free low molecular-weight polyphenols in selected species of dietary vegetables. The process involves two simple steps. First, the homogenized samples are extracted and partitioned using an organic solvent and salt solution. Then, the supernatant is further extracted and cleaned using a dSPE technique. Final clear extracts of vegetables were concentrated under vacuum to near dryness and taken up into initial mobile phase (0.1% formic acid and 20% methanol). The separation and quantification of free low molecular weight polyphenols from the vegetable extracts was achieved by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) equipped with a phodiode array (PDA) detection system and a Trifunctional High Strength Silica capillary analytical column (HSS T3), specially designed for polar compounds. The performance of the method was assessed by studying the selectivity, linear dynamic range, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, trueness, and matrix effects. The validation parameters of the method showed satisfactory figures of merit. Good linearity (Rvalues2>0.954; (+)-catechin in carrot samples) was achieved at the studied concentration range. Reproducibility was better than 3%. Consistent recoveries of polyphenols ranging from 78.4 to 99.9% were observed when all target vegetable samples were spiked at two concentration levels, with relative standard deviations (RSDs, n=5) lower than 2.9%.

A commercially available baby food (carrot/potato-based mash) was spiked with 11 pesticides at the respective EU maximum residue limits (MRLs), and further processed by either freezing or freeze-drying. Batches of some 150 units were produced per material type. First, the materials were assessed for the relative amount of pesticide recovered after processing (ratio of pesticide concentration in the processed material to the initially spiked pesticide concentration). In addition, the materials' homogeneity (bottle-to-bottle variation), and the short-term (1 month) and mid-term (5 months) stability at different temperatures were assessed. For this, an in-house validated GC-EI-MS method operated in the SIM mode with a sample preparation procedure based on the QuEChERS (""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe"") principle was applied. Measurements on the frozen material provided the most promising results (smallest analyte losses during production), and also freeze-drying proved to be a suitable alternative processing technique for most of the investigated pesticides.

21770413,"In plants, folate occurs predominantly as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF) polyglutamyl forms. Differences in stability and bioavailability of food folate compared to synthetic folic acid have been attributed to the presence of the polyglutamyl chain. High-pressure processing (HPP) was tested for whether it might shorten polyglutamyl chains of 5MTHF species in fresh vegetables by enabling action of native γ-glutamylhydrolase (GGH). A validated ultrahigh-performance reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using stable isotope as internal standard was applied for characterizing 5MTHF polyglutamyl profiles. HPP conditions included 300, 450, and 600 MPa at 30 °C for 0 or 5 min, and vegetables were vacuum-packed before treatment. Investigated vegetables included cauliflower (Brassica oleracea), baby carrots (Daucus carota), and carrot greens (D. carota). HPP treatment caused conversion of polyglutamyl 5MTHF species to short-chain and monoglutamyl forms. Maximal conversion of polyglutamyl folate to monoglutamyl folate occurred at the highest pressure/time combination investigated, 600 MPa/30 °C/5 min. Under this condition, cauliflower monoglutamyl folate increased nearly 4-fold, diglutamyl folate 32-fold, and triglutamyl folate 8-fold; carrot monoglutamyl increased 23-fold and diglutamyl 32-fold; and carrot greens monoglutamyl increased 2.5-fold and the diglutamyl form 19-fold. Although some folate degradation was observed at certain intermediate HPP conditions, total 5MTHF folate was largely preserved at 600 MPa/5 min.

According to many researchers vegetables from organic production and their products contain more beneficial nutrients than conventional vegetables. However the results in this field are not fully consistent. The research has been established to solve the rising doubts. The aim of work was to evaluate the level of bioactive compounds in organic and conventional carrot roots. Two varieties of carrots from organic and conventional system have been chosen to study: Flacoro and Perfekcja.

This study shows that carrot juice contains substances such as beta-carotene, phenylalanine or terpenes that may act as precursors for benzene formation during food processing. As benzene exposure has been associated with childhood leukaemia and other cancers, this study aimed to provide a quantitative risk assessment. To accomplish this, we used measured food consumption data from the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed (DONALD) study, along with survey data on benzene in different juice categories. The calculated exposures for infants between 3 and 12 months were low, with averages between 1 and 10 ng/kg bw/day, resulting in a margin of exposure above 100,000. The exposures were judged as unlikely to pose a health risk for infants. Nevertheless, carcinogenic contaminants should be reduced to levels as low as reasonably achievable.

19686752,"The enzyme pectin methylesterase (PME) was purified from red ripe tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) and through affinity chromatography two isoenzymes were fractionated (t1PME and t2PME). Further analysis of these two isoenzymes, both having a molar mass of 34.5kDa, revealed a difference in the N-terminal sequence and in amino acid composition. t1PME was identified as the major isoenzyme of PME in tomato fruit. In this study the aim was to develop a toolbox, consisting of monoclonal antibodies, that allows to gain insight into the in situ localization of PME in plant based food systems like tomatoes. A panel of six interesting monoclonal antibodies was raised against both isoenzymes, designated MA-TOM1-12E11, MA-TOM1-41B2, MA-TOM2-9H8, MA-TOM2-20G7, MA-TOM2-31H1 and MA-TOM2-38A11. The differences in epitopes between these monoclonal antibodies were determined using affinity tests towards denatured PME, cross-reactivity tests and inhibition tests. Characterization of these antibodies indicated an immunological difference between t1PME and t2PME, also revealing a conserved epitope on t2PME, carrot PME and strawberry PME. Different epitopes are recognized by the generated antibodies making them excellent probes for immunolocalization of PME by tissue printing. In tomato, t1PME and t2PME showed a pronounced co-localization, especially in the pericarp and the radial arms of the pericarp.

Evidence is mainly against all-E-beta-carotene, while there is no evidence against other carotenoids or against mixtures of beta-carotene stereoisomers. Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets. Population consumption patterns of carotenoid isomers using a comprehensive database are used to improve our understanding in disease prevention.

Pesticides were extracted from homogenized food samples with acetonitrile and decontaminated via the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) technique, using a primary secondary amine as sorbent prior to GPC-GC/MS analysis. A slightly modified preparation method and automated GPC step proved useful in minimizing matrix interference.

A low flow rate of 0.1 mL/min in GPC resulted in a 40-fold reduction in solvent consumption compared with conventional GPC column applications. The combination of MSPD technique and GPC-GC/MS for the analysis of the 97 pesticides can be accomplished within 90 min.

Residue uptake from soils depended on plant variety; Desiree potato and Nairobi carrot varieties were more susceptible to PAH contamination. Likewise, uptake of PCBs and OCPs depended on potato variety. There were significant positive correlations between the PCB and OCP concentrations (P<0.05) in soils and carrots but no significant correlation was found between the concentrations of any contaminants in soils and potatoes.

Xyloglucans, solubilized from plant cell walls by a sequential (enzymatic and chemical) extraction procedure, were isolated, and their structures were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. All campanulids examined, including Lactuca sativa (lettuce, order Asterales), Tenacetum ptarmiciflorum (dusty miller, order Asterales), and Daucus carota (carrot, order Apiales), produce typical xyloglucans that have an XXXG-type branching pattern and contain alpha-d-Xylp-, beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Xylp-, and alpha-L-Fucp-(1-->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Xylp- side chains. However, the lamiids produce atypical xyloglucans. For example, previous analyses showed that Capsicum annum (pepper) and Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato), two species in the order Solanales, and Olea europaea (olive, order Lamiales) produce xyloglucans that contain arabinosyl and galactosyl residues, but lack fucosyl residues. The XXGG-type xyloglucans produced by Solanaceous species are less branched than the XXXG-type xyloglucan produced by Olea europaea. This study shows that Ipomoea pupurea (morning glory, order Solanales), Ocimum basilicum (basil, order Lamiales), and Plantago major (plantain, order Lamiales) all produce xyloglucans that lack fucosyl residues and have an unusual XXGGG-type branching pattern in which the basic repeating core contains five glucose subunits in the backbone. Furthermore, Neruim oleander (order Gentianales) produces an XXXG-type xyloglucan that contains arabinosyl, galactosyl, and fucosyl residues. The appearance of this intermediate xyloglucan structure in oleander has implications regarding the evolutionary development of xyloglucan structure and its role in primary plant cell walls.",Carbohydrate research,"['D000438', 'D019659', 'D002212', 'D002236', 'D002473', 'D002851', 'D018552', 'D005936', 'D007477', 'D018545', 'D018551', 'D009682', 'D013058', 'D009844', 'D010802', 'D013045', 'D019032', 'D014990']","['Alcohols', 'Asteraceae', 'Capsicum', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cell Wall', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Daucus carota', 'Glucans', 'Ions', 'Lettuce', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Phylogeny', 'Species Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Xylans']",Structural analysis of xyloglucans in the primary cell walls of plants in the subclass Asteridae.,"['Q000737', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15975566,2005

The tested column configurations employed the same 3 m x 0.15 mm i.d. restriction capillary at the inlet end, but different analytical columns attached to the vacuum: (A) a 10 m x 0.53 mm i.d., 1 microm film thickness RTX-5 Sil MS column; and (B) a 10 m x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 microm film thickness DB-5MS column.

An extraction procedure was designed to prepare food cold-water soluble, hot-water soluble, cold-alkaline soluble, and hot-alkaline soluble fractions. A fluorescence microassay based on aniline blue dye, which bound specifically to 1,3-beta-G, was developed to measure its content in the food fractions. Curdlan was used as standard to construct the 1,3-beta-G calibration curve, and a linear correlation within a 14 microg/mL concentration range was obtained. This microassay displayed selectivities among various 1,3-beta-G species. Biologically active ones such as pachyman and yeast glucan possessed much stronger fluorescent signals than others such as laminarin and barley glucan. Possible fluorescent interference from food proteins was estimated. This assay tolerated up to 50% of bovine serum albumin in 10 microg/mL curdlan. Analysis of the four food fractions showed that besides the well-known lentinan-containing shiitake, popular foods such as celery, chin-chian leaves, carrot, and radish contained nearly 20% 1,3-beta-G in their total sugar. Soybean dry weight contained 0.8% 1,3-beta-G, which was twice the amount compared to shiitake.

The nitrate () and nitrite () contents of various vegetables (Chinese cabbage, radish, lettuce, spinach, soybean sprouts, onion, pumpkin, green onion, cucumber, potato, carrot, garlic, green pepper, cabbage and Allium tuberosum Roth known as Crown daisy) are reported. Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables. The average nitrite contents in various vegetables were about 0.6 mg kg(-1), and the values were not significantly different among most vegetables. It was observed that nitrate contents in vegetables varied depending on the type of vegetables and were similar to those in vegetables grown in other countries. From the results of our studies and other information from foreign sources, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to establish limits of nitrates contents of vegetables cultivated in Korea due to the co-presence of beneficial elements such as ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol which are known to inhibit the formation of nitrosamine.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000490', 'D001530', 'D001937', 'D002212', 'D002852', 'D004032', 'D006801', 'D007391', 'D007723', 'D009566', 'D009573', 'D019697', 'D031224', 'D012621', 'D013025', 'D013056', 'D006113', 'D014675']","['Allium', 'Belgium', 'Brassica', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Diet', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Korea', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrites', 'Onions', 'Raphanus', 'Seasons', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'United Kingdom', 'Vegetables']",Survey of nitrate and nitrite contents of vegetables grown in Korea.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'adverse effects', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12888387,2003

Among these bitter compounds, 3-methyl-6-methoxy-8-hydroxy-3,4-dihydroisocoumarin (6-methoxymellein), 5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2-methylchromone (eugenin), 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (gazarin), (Z)-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diin-3,8-diol (falcarindiol), (Z)-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diin-3-ol (falcarinol), and (Z)-3-acetoxy-heptadeca-1,9-diene-4,6-diin-8-ol (falcarindiol 3-acetate) could be identified on the basis of MS as well as 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments. Due to the low concentrations of <0.1 mg/kg and the high taste thresholds found for eugenin and gazarin, these compounds could be unequivocally excluded as important contributors to the bitter taste of carrots. Calculation of bitter activity values as the ratio of their concentration to their bitter detection threshold clearly demonstrated that neither in fresh and stored carrots nor in commercial carrot puree did 6-methoxymellein contribute to the bitter off-taste. In contrast, the concentrations of falcarindiol in stored carrots and, even more pronounced, in carrot puree were found to be 9- and 13-fold above its low bitter detection concentration of 0.04 mmol/kg, thus demonstrating that this acetylenic diol significantly contributes to the bitter taste of the carrot products investigated.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000480', 'D002850', 'D002851', 'D003080', 'D003374', 'D018552', 'D053280', 'D005233', 'D005519', 'D005707', 'D005960', 'D006801', 'D049934', 'D010936', 'D012997', 'D013649']","['Alkynes', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cold Temperature', 'Coumarins', 'Daucus carota', 'Diynes', 'Fatty Alcohols', 'Food Preservation', 'Gallic Acid', 'Glucosides', 'Humans', 'Isocoumarins', 'Plant Extracts', 'Solvents', 'Taste']",Structural and sensory characterization of compounds contributing to the bitter off-taste of carrots (Daucus carota L.) and carrot puree.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000031', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12797757,2003

These phenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health protecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic compounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known about alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the present study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount of selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In zucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic acid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin and quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In potatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, beans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher content of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with larger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of phenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was observed.

12374416,"A collaborative study was conducted to determine multiple pesticide residues in apple, green bean, and carrot by using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Seventeen laboratories from 7 countries participated in the final study, and a variety of different instruments was used by collaborators. The procedure simply entails 3 steps: (1) mix 1.1 g drying agent (Hydromatrix) per 1 g frozen precomminuted sample, and load 4-5.5 g of this mixture into a 7-10 mL extraction vessel; (2) perform SFE for 20-30 min with a 1-2 mL/min flow rate of carbon dioxide at 0.85 g/mL density (320 atm, 60 degrees C); and (3) inject the extract, which was collected on a solid-phase or in a liquid trap, into the gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, using either an ion-trap instrument in full-scan mode or a quadrupole-type instrument in selected-ion monitoring mode. The ability of GC/MS to simultaneously quantitate and confirm the identity of the semivolatile analytes at trace concentrations is a strong feature of the approach. The selectivity of SFE and GC/MS avoids the need for post-extraction cleanup steps, and the conversion of the CO2 solvent to a gas after SFE eliminates the solvent evaporation step common in traditional methods. The approach has several advantages, but its main drawback is the lower recoveries for the most polar analytes, such as methamidophos and acephate, and the most nonpolar analytes, such as pyrethroids. Recoveries for most pesticides are >75%, and recoveries of nonpolar analytes are still >50%. The (within-laboratory) repeatability relative standard deviation (RSDr) values of the recoveries are generally <15%. More specifically, the average results from the 9-14 laboratories in the final analysis of 6 blind duplicates at 3 concentrations for each pesticide are as follows: carbofuran in apple (75-500 ng/g), 89% recovery, 7% RSDr, 9% reproducibility relative standard deviation (RSDR); diazinon in apple (60-400 ng/g), 83% recovery, 13% RSDr, 17% RSDR; vinclozolin in apple (6-400 ng/g), 97% recovery, 13% RSDr, 18% RSDR; chlorpyrifos in apple (50-300 ng/g), 105% recovery, 11% RSDr, 13% RSDR; endosulfan sulfate in apple (150-1000 ng/g), 95% recovery, 15% RSDr, 17% RSDR; trifluralin in green bean (30-200 ng/g), 58% recovery, 11% RSDr, 27% RSDR; dacthal in green bean (60-400 ng/g), 88% recovery, 11% RSDr, 17% RSDR; quintozene in green bean (60-400 ng/g), 79% recovery, 13% RSDr, 18% RSDR; chlorpyrifos in green bean (50-300 ng/g), 84% recovery, 11% RSDr, 17% RSDR; p,p'-DDE in green bean (45-300 ng/g), 64% recovery, 14% RSDr, 27% RSDR; atrazine in carrot (75-500 ng/g), 90% recovery, 11% RSDr, 15% RSDR; metalaxyl in carrot (75-500 ng/g), 89% recovery, 8% RSDr, 12% RSDR; parathion-methyl in carrot (75-500 ng/g), 84% recovery, 14% RSDr, 15% RSDR; chlorpyrifos in carrot (50-300 ng/g), 77% recovery, 13% RSDr, 19% RSDR; and bifenthrin in carrot (90-600 ng/g), 63% recovery, 12% RSDr, and 25% RSDR.

This method uses ion-exchange liquid chromatography coupled on-line to atomic fluorescence spectrometry through continuous hydride generation. Various extraction procedures have been studied in detail using three plant certified reference materials. None of the procedures tested revealed fully satisfying results with all kinds of plant samples; microwave assisted extraction with 0.3 mol dm-3 orthophosphoric acid was found to be the most convenient for dealing with terrestrial plants. Species stability appears good. This method was applied to real world cultivated plant parts. Arsenate appears to predominate in soils, roots and leaves; unidentified species (probably arsenosugars) play an important role (60%) in rice fruits. Carrot was found to be the most contaminated edible plant part, containing 1 mg kg-1 essentially as arsenate species. MMAA was detected in all soils and some plant parts especially shallots at low levels, whereas DMAA was found only in one soil sample and in hot pepper leaves.

11823572,"The extent to which processing affects the carotene or vitamin A value of foods is poorly understood. An extrinsic reference method was used to estimate the mass of carotenes and vitamin A derived from various preparations made from the same lot of carrots. Using a repeated-measures design, nine healthy adult subjects consumed test meals of either carrot puree (commercial baby food) or boiled-mashed carrots on separate days; six of the subjects also consumed a test meal of raw-grated carrot. Test meals supplied 34.7 micromol (18.6 mg) carrot beta-carotene (beta C), plus 6 micromol deuterium-labeled retinyl acetate (d(4)-RA) in oil solution. Baseline-adjusted carotene and retinyl ester (R-ester) area-under-curve (AUC) responses in the triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein (TRL) fraction (0-8.5 h) were determined using HPLC and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The masses of absorbed beta C, alpha-carotene (alpha C) and R-ester were estimated by comparing their AUC values with that of deuterium-labeled retinyl ester (d(4)-R-ester), assuming the latter represented 80% of the d(4)-RA reference dose. Absorption of beta C and alpha C was approximately twofold greater from carrot puree than from boiled-mashed carrots, whereas the retinol yield was only marginally (P = 0.11) influenced by treatment. Carotene and R-ester absorption from raw-grated carrot was intermediate to, and did not differ significantly from the cooked preparations. The vitamin A yield (puree, 0.53 mg; boiled-mashed, 0.44 mg) of cooked carrot containing 18.6 mg beta C was substantially less than that predicted by current convention and limited primarily by intestinal carotene uptake.

By HPLC fractionation and tracking the biological activity with the carrot test, we isolated the sulfakinin EQFDDY(SO3H) GHMRFamide (Pea-SK). A synthetic version of the peptide inhibited food intake when injected at doses of 1 microg (50% inhibition) and 10 microg (60% inhibition). The sulfate group was required for food-intake inhibition.

Both Pyr c 5 and Bet v 6 allergens had similar IgE binding characteristics in immunoblotting and enzyme allergosorbent tests (EAST), and bound IgE from 10 sera of birch-pollen-allergic patients including six pear-allergic subjects. EAST inhibition experiments with Pyr c 5 as the solid phase antigen suggested that homologous allergens may be present in many vegetable foods such as apple, peach, orange, lychee fruit, strawberry, persimmon, zucchini (courgette), and carrot. In extracts of pear, apple, orange, and persimmon, the presence of proteins of approximately 30-35 kDa containing Bet v 6 cross-reactive epitopes was demonstrated with two Bet v 6-specific monoclonal antibodies. Recombinant Pyr c 5 triggered a strong, dose-dependent mediator release from basophils of a pear-allergic subject, suggesting that Pyr c 5 has the potential to elicit type I allergic reactions.",European journal of biochemistry,"['D000485', 'D000595', 'D029662', 'D003001', 'D003429', 'D005512', 'D005638', 'D006636', 'D006801', 'D006967', 'D007106', 'D015151', 'D007073', 'D008969', 'D009249', 'D010088', 'D044925', 'D011058', 'D017386', 'D014675']","['Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Betula', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cross Reactions', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Fruit', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NADP', 'Oxidoreductases', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors', 'Pollen', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Vegetables']","Phenylcoumaran benzylic ether and isoflavonoid reductases are a new class of cross-reactive allergens in birch pollen, fruits and vegetables.","['Q000737', None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000276', 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000276', 'Q000276', None, 'Q000276', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000201']","['chemistry', None, 'enzymology', None, 'immunology', 'immunology', 'enzymology', None, None, 'immunology', 'immunology', None, 'immunology', None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'enzymology', None, 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11606193,2001
11556334,"A fast method of analysis for 20 representative pesticides was developed using low-pressure gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (LP-GC-MS). No special techniques for injection or detection with a common quadrupole GC-MS instrument were required to use this approach. The LP-GC-MS approach used an analytical column of 10 m x 0.53 mm I.D., 1 microm film thickness coupled with a 3 m x 0.15 mm I.D. restriction capillary at the inlet end. Thus, the conditions at the injector were similar to conventional GC methods, but sub-atmospheric pressure conditions occurred throughout the analytical column (MS provided the vacuum source). Optimal LP-GC-MS conditions were determined which achieved the fastest separation with the highest signal/noise ratio in MS detection (selected ion monitoring mode). Due to faster flow-rate, thicker film, and low pressure in the analytical column, this distinctive approach provided several benefits in the analysis of the representative pesticides versus a conventional GC-MS method, which included: (i) threefold gain in the speed of chromatographic analysis; (ii) substantially increased injection volume capacity in toluene; (iii) heightened peaks with 2 s peak widths for normal MS operation; (iv) reduced thermal degradation of thermally labile analytes, such as carbamates; and (v) due to larger sample loadability lower detection limits for compounds not limited by matrix interferences. The optimized LP-GC-MS conditions were evaluated in ruggedness testing experiments involving repetitive analyses of the 20 diverse pesticides fortified in a representative food extract (carrot), and the results were compared with the conventional GC-MS approach. The matrix interferences for the quantitation ions were worse for a few pesticides (acephate, methiocarb, dimethoate, and thiabendazole) in LP-GC-MS, but similar or better results were achieved for the 16 other analytes, and sample throughput was more than doubled with the approach.",Journal of chromatography.

As part of a screening process, the growth of 15 cultures in a vegetable juice medium (VJM) was characterized by automated spectrophotometry. Acidification patterns as well as viability during storage of the LAB were also established. There were greater differences between the pure cultures than the mixed ones with respect to growth in VJM and viability during storage. Reductions in viable cell counts during storage of the fermented VJM occurred more rapidly with a Leuconostoc strain than for pediococci or lactobacilli. Inoculation of vegetables was carried out with cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum NK-312, Pediococcus acidilactici AFERM 772 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides BLAC which were rehydrated in a brine. This rehydration procedure was not detrimental to viability. During fermentation of a carrot/cabbage vegetable mix, sugar metabolism was characterized by the assimilation of both glucose and fructose, but sugars remained in the fermented vegetables when acidification stopped. The pH in the LAB-inoculated vegetables after 72 h at 20 degrees C was significantly lower (by 0.2 units) than the uninoculated control. Inoculation with LAB designed for silage fermentation resulted in the inhibition of acetic acid production, and reduced the production of ethanol during fermentation.

The stability of some colorants has been studied in sugar and non-sugar drink models at three pH values (3, 4, and 5) under thermal and light conditions simulating rapid food aging. At a given pH, color stability mainly depends on the structures of anthocyanins and of colorless phenolic compounds. Colorants rich in acylated anthocyanins (purple carrot, red radish, and red cabbage) display great stability due to intramolecular copigmentation. The protection of red chromophore is higher for diacylated anthocyanins in red radish and red cabbage. For colorants without acylated anthocyanins (grape-marc, elderberry, black currant, and chokeberry), intermolecular copigmentation plays a key role in color protection. Colorants rich in flavonols and with the highest copigment/pigment ratio show a remarkable stability. By contrast, catechins appear to have a negative effect on red colorants, quickly turning yellowish in drink models. This effect is more pronounced when the pH is increased.

9381082,"The research was performed to determine both safety of carrot dishes consumption taking into account lead and cadmium intake and prospect of lowering content of these elements in carrot during culinary processing. Different but unspecified varieties of investigated carrot came from the Warsaw market and from allotments and fields in Upper Silesia. Lead and cadmium level was determined in raw material as well as the elements' distribution in different parts of carrot root. The impact of initial treatment including peeling and soaking in water of the crumbled vegetable was studied. The carrot was cooked traditionally beginning with boiling or cold water. Lead and cadmium content were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry for extracts of APDC complexes. The investigated raw material contained little lead (an average 0.019 mg/kg) and cadmium (average 0.015 mg/kg). Both elements are distributed in layers in entire carrot root. The highest concentration of both lead and cadmium can be found in the skin (0.075 mg Pb and 0.0115 mg Cd/kg skin), lower in parenchyma (0.028 mg Pb and 0.066 mg Cd/kg parenchyma) and the lowest in the core (0.027 mg Pb and Cd/kg core). Because of unequal concentration of both elements in each layer, peeling eliminates up to 25% lead and about 19% cadmium. Keeping carrot in water showed a tendency to diminish the level of both elements in raw material. Soaking carrot for 24 h made it shed 40% of lead and 67% of cadmium. Cooking process decreased both metal's concentration in the vegetable. The traditional cooking method diminished lead content by 6-47% and cadmium content by 35-44%.",Roczniki Panstwowego Zakladu Higieny,"['D002104', 'D003296', 'D018552', 'D005511', 'D007854', 'D011044', 'D013054']","['Cadmium', 'Cooking', 'Daucus carota', 'Food Handling', 'Lead', 'Poland', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",[The influence of culinary processing on content of lead and cadmium in carrots].,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9381082,1997
24227308,"Ovipositing black swallowtail butterflies,Papilio polyxenes, make their final host-selection decisions on the basis of compounds present on the leaf surface. Little information is available, however, on the chemistry of leaf surfaces. The purpose of this study was to develop a technique to extract and quantify the concentrations of compounds from the leaf surfaces ofDaucus carota, one of the main host species forP. polyxenes, with particular reference to compounds already identified as contact oviposition stimulants, namelytrans-chlorogenic acid (CA) and luteolin-7-O-(6″-O-malonyl)-β-D-glucopyranoside (L7MG), as well as its degradation product luteolin-7-glucoside (L7G). Plant surfaces were extracted by dipping leaves sequentially in pairs of solvents: (1) CHCl3-MeOH, (2) near-boiling H2O, (3) CHCl3-near-boiling H2O, and (4) CH2Cl2-CH2Cl2. The resulting extracts were fractionated and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The leaf-surface concentrations of each compound were calculated using regressions relating leaf surface area to leaf weight that were obtained from measurements of field-collected carrot plants. All four methods removed the three compounds from carrot leaf surfaces, but the solvent systems differed in effectiveness. The chloroform-near-boiling water solvent system performed better than the other solvent combinations, but not significantly so. This system also extracted the highest number of polar, UV-absorbing compounds. Methylene chloride was significantly less efficient than the other methods. An additional test confirmed that the chloroform-near-boiling water method removed compounds from the surface alone and probably not from the apoplast or symplast. Surface concentrations of CA (up to 600 ng/cm(2) leaf surface) were substantially greater than those of the two flavonoid compounds. No clear seasonal trend in concentrations was evident from the limited number of sampling dates.

8994352,"In the fly, thorough retinoid deprivation is possible, to optimize investigation of the effects of vitamin A metabolites and retinoic acid (RA) on visual development. Retinoids had been found to control fly opsin gene transcription, though this finding was contested. Northern blots on Drosophila heads showed that mRNA of Rh1 (the predominant rhodopsin) was high in vitamin A replete controls, very low in deprived flies, and increased upon feeding carrot juice to deprived flies as early as 1 hr. Expression of the ribosomal protein 49 [rp49] gene (the control) was equal both in deprivation and in replacement. Recovery of Rh1 protein upon such carotenoid replacement followed, barely detectable on Western blots at 4 hr but conspicuous by 8 hr. Alternative chromophore deprivation with yeast-glucose food yielded flies with opsin mRNA on Northerns but not rhodopsin, as demonstrated by Western blots, spectrophotometry and the electroretinogram (ERG). Rh1's mRNA but not Rh1 protein resulted from rearing flies from egg to adult on the otherwise deprivational medium supplemented with RA or beef brain-heart infusion. By comparing results from these different media it was concluded that: [1] deprivation and replacement affect opsin gene transcription; and [2] contradictory conclusions were from chromophore deprivation which does not eliminate all retinoid dependent factors which could affect the opsin promoter. Preliminary evidence shows that carotenoid deprivation decreases two proteins relevant to visual function: [1] phospholipase C (PLC); and [2] Drosophila retinoid binding protein (DRBP).",Experimental eye research,"['D000818', 'D015152', 'D015153', 'D002338', 'D004331', 'D004596', 'D005786', 'D015591', 'D012333', 'D017299', 'D014212']","['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carotenoids', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electroretinography', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Microspectrophotometry', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rod Opsins', 'Tretinoin']",Control of Drosophila opsin gene expression by carotenoids and retinoic acid: northern and western analyses.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000008', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000494']","[None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', 'genetics', None, 'drug effects', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8994352,1997

For this reason, microwave digestion with HNO3 and cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS) with tin (II) chloride reduction, were used. Both digestion and determination conditions were experimentally optimized. The procedure was checked using two real food samples: apple juice and preserved carrot with peas both spiked on two levels with mercury. On these results basic statistic parameters that characterized the method as standard deviation, relative standard deviation and recovery, were calculated. The precision was generally better than 10%, and recovery ranged from 96 to 100%. The detection limit of the entire procedure, defined as the mercury concentration corresponding to three times the standard deviation of ten consecutive determinations of blank measurement, was 0.012 microgram/l. Taking into account the amount of a sample and the factor of dilution the detection limit corresponds to 0.3 microgram/kg for 1.0 g, 1.0 microgram/kg for 0.3 g, and 0.15 microgram/l for 2 ml of a sample. Accuracy of the analytical procedure was tested by analysing five certified reference plant materials with the mercury contents ranged from 6 to 280 micrograms/kg. The obtained results were in a good agreement with their certified values.

Comparative values are given from a background area, namely a domestic garden located in the North Yorkshire Dales National Park area. Analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quality control assessment using four international biological reference materials; BCR:CRM 62 Olive Leaves, NIST 1575 Pine Needles, NIST 1573 Tomato Leaves, and NIST 1572 Citrus Leaves. Inter-analytical method comparison is given using two methods of ICP-MS; namely conventional pneumatic nebulisation of sample solution, and direct solids analysis by laser ablation; and neutron activation analysis methods (NAA). For the elements listed there is a good precision obtained by ICP-MS and NAA. In particular levels of < +/- 1-10% (rsd) are obtained. Comparison of data with certified values and other analytical methods are generally of very good agreement. Lead levels in background areas ranged from 0.0008 to 0.340 microgram/g (fresh weight) for plant material; with the lead magnitude greater for grasses > herbs > vegetables > cereals > fruits. Measured values are in good agreement with reported literature values. The lowest Pb values are for marrow, lettuce, tomato and sweet corn samples (approximately 0.001-0.021 microgram/g).

In cherry, strawberry, black and red currant jams the concentrations were from 6.30 to 97.38 mg KNO3/kg, the highest content was in cherry jam. In plum jam nitrates were found in low amounts from 11.65 to 12.09 mg/kg. In ""Bobofrut"" juices the nitrate content was higher than in the above products, ranging from 26.37 to 182.75 mg KNO3/kg. Nitrite content in all these groups of products was low, not exceeding 1 mg NaNO2/kg, with the exception of plum jam where the maximal value was found 1.65 mg NaNO2/kg. In stewed fruit and herb syrups and in honey nitrates ranged from 1.0 to 94.5 mg KNO3/kg. Nitrite content ranged from 0.17 to 1.92 mg/kg in herb syrups, from 0.0 to 1.20 mg/kg in stewed fruit, and from 0.0 to 0.40 mg NaNO2/kg in honey. The study showed that higher levels of nitrates were present as a rule in vegetable juices. However, the found concentrations were not harmful to the health of children, although this is possible in the case of carrot juice, especially when kept at room temperature for 24 hours.",Roczniki Panstwowego Zakladu Higieny,"['D002648', 'D002664', 'D005519', 'D005628', 'D005638', 'D006722', 'D006801', 'D009566', 'D009573', 'D013053', 'D014675']","['Child', 'Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Food Preservation', 'Frozen Foods', 'Fruit', 'Honey', 'Humans', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrites', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Vegetables']","[Occurrence of nitrates and nitrites in certain frozen fruits, jams, stewed fruit and fruit-vegetable juices for children and in certain types of bee honey].","[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2637478,1990
7299074,"Permethrin, cypermethrin, fenpropanate and fenvalerate (emulsifiable concentrates) were applied at 280 g AI/ha and incorporated into mineral and organic soil contained in small field plots. Radishes and carrots were grown to serve as indicators of insecticide uptake. Similar plots were treated with the same insecticides at 140 g AI/ha and the soil surface was left undisturbed following application. Soil cores were removed at appropriate intervals and the crops were harvested when mature. The insecticide concentration in all samples was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The amount of insecticide in the soil declined rapidly to less than 50% of the initial value in 1 month or less for most material-soil-treatment combinations and within 2 months for all cases. Concentrations remained in excess of 0.01 ppm in the organic soil for at least six months for all material-treatment combinations but fell below this level over 2-5 months in the mineral soils. Organic soil incorporated fenvalerate was the most persistent combination overall with 25, 17 and 7% remaining at 6, 18 and 28 months respectively. The trans-isomers of permethrin and cypermethrin disappeared more quickly than the cis-isomers but the insecticidally active IR isomers were not preferentially degraded relative to the inactive 1S. No residues (less than 0.01 ppm) were found in the radish or carrot crops. First order disappearance rates were not constant for any of the combinations. A comparison of partial rate constants showed: 1) 0-1 mo rates were generally greater in mineral than organic soil, 2) 1-6 mo rates in organic soil were lower than 0-1 mo rates, 3) 1-6 mo rates for surface applications to organic soil were generally less than for incorporated applications. In laboratory experiments, 0-1 mo rates for fenvalerate disappearance in a mineral soil were 2-3x greater for 0.5 ppm than for 10 ppm while 1-6 mo rates were independent of insecticide concentration but were 1.5x greater for 0.5% moisture than for 5%.","Journal of environmental science and health.

546852,"The gas-liquid chromatographic behavior of methomyl (methyl N-[(methyl-carbamoyl)oxy]thioacetimidate), oxamyl (methyl N',N'-dimethyl-N-[(methylcarbamoyl)oxyl]-1-thiooxamimidate), their respective oxime hydrolysis products and the trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers of the oximes on 5% OV-1 was studied under isothermal conditions using a flame-photometric detector in the sulfur-selective mode. In contrast to the behavior of the parent carbamates and underivatized oximes, the oxime-TMS ethers readily produced symmetrical peaks of consistent size. Quantities of derivative equivalent to at least 0.25 ng of oxime were easily measurable. Derivative formation was reproducible for standards over the range 10.0 to 0.25 microgram/ml in benzene and at 10.0 and 0.50 microgram/ml in the presence of extractives from tomato, carrot and celery at concentrations equivalent to 10 g/ml of crop. Derivative yields from crop extract fotifications were 89% or better in most cases. Both the carbamates and oximes were simply and consistently recovered in high yield from crops fortified at 1.00 and 0.05 ppm using the procedures described. The inclusion of a second analytical step provided separate analysis for oximes and carbamates. The application of these observations to the analyses of residues in crops is discussed.",Journal of chromatography,"['D002219', 'D002849', 'D006868', 'D007306', 'D008724', 'D010091', 'D010573', 'D014297', 'D014675']","['Carbamates', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Hydrolysis', 'Insecticides', 'Methomyl', 'Oximes', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Trimethylsilyl Compounds', 'Vegetables']",Determination of residues of methomyl and oxamyl and their oximes in crops by gas-liquid chromatography of oxime trimethylsilyl ethers.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/546852,1980

Skin reactions among other atopics were rare, and non-atopic patients showed no reactions to fresh fruits and vegetables. Apple and carrot as well as apple seeds and carrot seeds were fractionated using column chromatography. Two major fractions were obtained, one with sugar and proteins, and one with proteins, the latter giving skin reactions more often than the former. The correlation between clinical symptoms and skin test results with the fractionated material was somewhat lower than that obtained with the non-fractionated fresh material.
