35292709,"Diet based on cereal, vegetables, oleaginous and dried fish are providing essential metallic elements. It can be also a source of exposure to toxic metallic elements. The aims of this study were to evaluate the contents on nine metallic trace elements (Fe, Zn, Mn, Co, Cd, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr) in some major raw foodstuffs including rice, maize, peanut, tomato and dried fish in Burkina Faso and assess the health risk of these elements. Two hundred twenty-two samples were collected and analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. The health risk assessment was based on the United States Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) model. Iron and Zinc were the elements with the highest concentrations in the investigated foodstuffs. The iron highest median value (68.80 mg/kg) was observed in dried fish followed by maize (43.09 mg/kg) and peanuts (28.92 mg/kg). Rates of 77.95%, 66.66% and 32.5% obtained respectively fro tomato, maize and rice samples were above the maximum limit of lead set by Codex Alimentarius while 47.6%, 71.16% and 0% of maize, tomato and rice samples respectively have shown concentration above the maximum limit of cadmium. Chromium had shown higher contribution rate to the maximum daily intake of 167.11%, 34%, 2% and 8.53% for rice, maize and peanut respectively.

35267361,"Consumption of tree nuts and peanuts has considerably increased over the last decades due to their nutritional composition and the content of beneficial compounds. On the other hand, such widespread consumption worldwide has also generated a growing incidence of allergy in the sensitive population. Allergy to nuts and peanuts represents a global relevant problem, especially due to the risk of the ingestion of hidden allergens as a result of cross-contamination between production lines at industrial level occurring during food manufacturing. The present review provides insights on peanuts, almonds, and four nut allergens-namely hazelnuts, walnuts, cashew, and pistachios-that are likely to cross-contaminate different food commodities. The paper aims at covering both the biochemical aspect linked to the identified allergenic proteins for each allergen category and the different methodological approaches developed for allergens detection and identification. Attention has been also paid to mass spectrometry methods and to current efforts of the scientific community to identify a harmonized approach for allergens quantification through the detection of allergen markers.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Tree Nuts and Peanuts as a Source of Beneficial Compounds and a Threat for Allergic Consumers: Overview on Methods for Their Detection in Complex Food Products.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35267361,2022
35201367,"The design and production of incurred test materials are critical for the development and validation of methods for food allergen analysis. This is because production and processing conditions, together with the food matrix, can modify allergens affecting their structure, extractability and detectability. For the ThRAll project, which aims to develop a mass spectrometry-based reference method for the simultaneous accurate quantification of six allergenic ingredients in two hard to analyse matrices. Two highly processed matrices, chocolate bars and broth powder, were selected to incur with six allergenic ingredients (egg, milk, peanut, soy, hazelnut and almond) at 2, 4, 10 and 40 mg total allergenic protein/kg food matrix using a pilot-scale food manufacturing plant. The allergenic activity of the ingredients incurred was verified using food-allergic patient serum/plasma IgE, the homogeneity of the incurred matrices verified and their stability at 4 °C assessed over at least 30-month storage using appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Allergens were found at all levels from the chocolate bar and were homogenously distributed, apart from peanut and soy which could only be determined above 4 mg total allergenic ingredient protein/kg. The homogeneity assessment was restricted to analysis of soy, milk and peanut for the broth powder but nevertheless demonstrated that the allergens were homogeneously distributed.

This study presents an optical method for determining the adulteration level of EVOO with soybean oil as well as peanut oil using LED-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. Eight LEDs with central wavelengths from ultra-violet (UV) to blue are tested to induce the fluorescence spectra of EVOO, peanut oil, and soybean oil, and the UV LED of 372 nm is selected for further detection. Samples are prepared by mixing olive oil with different volume fractions of peanut or soybean oil, and their fluorescence spectra are collected. Different pre-processing and regression methods are utilized to build the prediction model, and good linearity is obtained between the predicted and actual adulteration concentration. This result, accompanied by the non-destruction and no pre-treatment characteristics, proves that it is feasible to use LED-induced fluorescence spectroscopy as a way to investigate the EVOO adulteration level, and paves the way for building a hand-hold device that can be applied to real market conditions in the future.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","['D010367', 'D005506', 'D000069463', 'D010938', 'D013024', 'D013050']","['Arachis', 'Food Contamination', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Soybean Oil', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']","Quantitative Detection of Extra Virgin Olive Oil Adulteration, as Opposed to Peanut and Soybean Oil, Employing LED-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35161972,2022
35080159,"Disulfoton, an organophosphorus pesticide, is used to control cotton, beet, potato, and other seedling period aphids, leaf moths, underground pests, etc., with internal absorption, killing, gastric poisoning, and fumigation. Disulfoton is a highly toxic organophosphate pesticide, which can inhibit cholinesterase activity, resulting in neurophysiological disorders by inhalation, feeding, and transdermal absorption. Disulfoton is difficult to degrade in the environment, which leads to enrichment in organisms and interference with endocrine. This compound is harmful to the ecological environment and human health. To ensure the quality and safety of food, it is important to develop a detection method for disulfoton and its metabolites in agricultural products.

After roasting, Ara h 2 and its derivatives in the matrix were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC). The structure and allergenicity of Ara h 2 were analyzed by circular dichroism, mass spectrometry (MS), western blotting, the enzyme-linked immunoassay, and cell modeling. Our results showed that a large portion of Ara h 2 was fragmented and cross-linked. Ara h 2 monomers accounted for only 13% of the total proteins after IAC purification. In addition, the structure of Ara h 2 changed after roasting. In addition to methylation and oxidation modification, the disulfide bonds of Ara h 2 were found to be rearranged after roasting. In the conformational structure of Ara h 2, the content of the α-helix decreased from 27.1 to 21.6% after roasting, while the content of the random coil increased from 29.1 to 34.3%. Six cleavage sites of trypsin were exposed, while three were covered. In terms of allergenicity, most of the cross-linking products were not recognized by patients' sera. Only one faint band around 40 kDa was observed in our blotting. For Ara h 2 monomers, roasting enhanced their IgE binding capacity and ability to stimulate the degranulation of basophils.

Fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) is a novel lipid class that was discovered as an endogenous lipid; FAHFAs have shown anti-diabetic effects in a mammalian system. We analyzed the overall FAHFA composition in nut oils and other common oils: almond (raw, roasted), walnut, peanut, olive, palm, soybean, and rapeseed oils. We developed a method of liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) for a comprehensive target analysis of FAHFAs. The analysis revealed wide variation in the FAHFA profiles (15 compounds and 62 peaks). For 7-11 compounds of FAHFA, a total level of 8-29 pmol/mg oil was detected in nuts oils; for 11 compounds, 4.9 pmol/mg oil was detected in olive oil, and for 4-9 compounds, < 2 pmol/mg oil was detected in palm, soy, and rapeseed oils. The major FAHFAs were FAHFA 36:3, FAHFA 36:2, and FAHFA 36:4 in nut oil, FAHFA 36:2, FAHFA 34:1, and FAHFA 36:1 in olive oil, and FAHFA 32:1, FAHFA 34:0, FAHFA 36:0, and FAHFA 36:1 in all of the common oils. The composition of FAHFAs in nut oils is mainly unsaturated fatty acids, whereas those in olive oil are unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. The composition of FAHFAs in common oils was mainly saturated fats. This is the first report to demonstrate the quality and quantity of the FAHFAs in the nut oils.

In this research, we measured the content of As, Cd, Pb and Hg in a wide variety of edible nuts. To determine the As content, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was applied. Cd and Pb were detected by the electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry analytical technique (ETAAS) with Zeeman background correction, while atomic absorption spectrometry method (AAS) with the amalgamation technique in the case of Hg was used. The study material consisted of 120 samples without replications (10 for each subgroup) including the following nuts: Almonds, Brazil nuts, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, pecan nuts, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts. Indicators such as the target hazard quotient (THQ), cancer risk (CR) and hazard index (HI) were used to assess the health risk. The highest median As, Cd, Pb and Hg contents were observed for pistachios (192.42 µg/kg), pine nuts (238.40 µg/kg), peanuts (82.06 µg/kg) and pecans (82.06 µg/kg), respectively. The exceedance of the established limits was found in the case of Pb for nine samples: macadamia nuts (221.49 µg/kg; 2350.94 µg/kg; 2581.43 µg/kg), pine nuts (266.33 µg/kg), peanuts (1353.80 µg/kg) and pecans (2689.13 µg/kg, 2758.26 µg/kg, 2992.29 µg/kg and 3169.41 µg/kg). Extremely high (>2500 µg/kg) Pb content was found in 33% of studied pecans imported from the USA. The health risk indicators did not identify increased health risk. This research is significant considering the food safety issues and indicates the need to regularly control the content of toxic elements in food, as well as to establish the specific limits for heavy metals content in nuts. The chemometric analysis included cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Cluster analysis made it possible to distinguish four subgroups on the basis of the ability to accumulate toxic elements: pine nuts, pecans, pistachios and other analysed nuts. PCA indicated primarily factor 1, distinguishing mainly pecans, macadamia nuts and peanuts.

34677022,"An analysis method based on gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) with single acquisition was established for the simultaneous rapid screening and accurate confirmation of 197 pesticide residues in edible vegetable oil. First, a standard library of the 197 pesticides was established. The library contained GC-TOF-MS information such as retention time, accurate mass measurements of quantitative and quantitative ions, and ratio of the qualitative ion. According to the European Union regulation (SANTE/11945/2015), the standard for qualitative determination by HRMS was determined; that is, each compound was confirmed by at least two ions. Second, the instrument conditions and sample pretreatment conditions for the determination of different pesticides were optimized. The following observations were made: the extraction efficiency of acetonitrile was better than that of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid because pesticide recovery in the former case was in the range of 70%-120%; C18 and PSA adsorbents exerted a better purification effect than did the other two purification materials (C18 and Z-Sep adsorbent or PRiME HLB column), thus ensuring good recovery of the target compounds; most pesticides showed a matrix enhancement effect, necessitating the use of a matrix-matched external calibration method for quantitation. Finally, based on the above findings, the experimental procedure was established. The edible vegetable oil samples were ultrasonically extracted with acetonitrile, and the resultant solution was subjected ot fat removal by freezing at -20 ℃ for 2 h. The supernatant (1.0 mL) was cleaned-up by dispersive solid phase extraction using 50 mg C18 and 50 mg PSA powder. The compounds were separated on an HP-5MS UI capillary column (30 m×0.25 mm×0.25 μm) and ionized using an electron impact ion source. Qualitative and quantitative detection of the pesticides was completed in full scan mode. The retention time, mass accuracy, and qualitative ion matching ratio were used for qualitative screening, while the peak areas of the quantitative ion were used for quantification. The limits of quantification (LOQs) of 174 pesticides were 0.01 mg/kg, and the LOQs of the other 23 pesticides ranged from 0.025 to 0.1 mg/kg. The linear ranges were LOQs to 200 μg/L for 196 pesticides, and from 2 to 100 μg/L for biphenyl, with the correlation coefficients being greater than 0.99. The recoveries of 156 pesticides were in the range of 70% to 120% at three spiked levels (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg), accounting for 79% of the total pesticides. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of pesticide residues in 23 edible vegetable oil samples. Chlorpyrifos was detected in all six peanut oil samples. Bromopropylate, fenpropathrin, oxadiazon, permethrin, tebufenpyrad, cyproconazole and pirimiphos-methyl were detected in a fourth-grade rapeseed oil sample.

Oil body protein extracts (OBPEs), mainly oleosins, contribute to the unique physicochemical stability of OBs. The application of OBPEs in aqueous environment has been greatly limited by their highly hydrophobic structures. In this study, OBPEs were successfully extracted from peanut seeds and their profiles were characterized by LC-MS/MS. OBPEs nanoparticles were successfully assembled in aqueous environment for the first time using the antisolvent precipitation method. The mean diameter of OBPEs nanoparticles was 215.6 ± 1.8 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.238 ± 0.005. The morphology of these colloidal particles was found to be roughly spherical shape as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) are markers of choice for DNA fingerprinting studies as they exhibit high polymorphism due to variable number of repeats. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate and optimize a method for DNA isolation from groundnut oil and study the possibility of using the isolated DNA for molecular traceability using SSR markers. Four methods to isolate DNA from groundnut oil were evaluated. All the four methods were modified CTAB protocols, but differed in procedures for extraction, buffer compositions, amount of oil used and DNA carriers. For molecular traceability of oils, extraction and recovery of DNA from edible oil is a key step, especially in refined oils. A method that employed DNA enrichment prior to extraction with CTAB buffer yielded amplifiable DNA from cold pressed GNO, crude hexane extracted GNO and refined GNO. The optimized method for isolation of DNA from groundnut oil is simple, efficient, less costly and reproducible when compared to chromatography and spectroscopy based techniques.",Journal of food science and technology,[],[],"Evaluation of DNA extraction methods for molecular traceability in cold pressed, solvent extracted and refined groundnut oils.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366473,2021

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has emerged as an orthogonal technique in complement to immunochemical-based assays. However, the absence of established guidelines for MS-based quantification of allergens in food has limited harmonization among the method development community. In this study, different quantification strategies were evaluated using a previously developed multiplexed LC-MS/MS method for the detection of egg, milk, and peanut. Peptide performance criteria (retention time, signal-to-noise ratio, and ion ratio tolerance) were established and quantification approaches using varying calibrants, internal standards, background matrices, and calibration curve preparation schemes were systematically evaluated to refine the previous method for routine laboratory use. A matrix-matched calibration curve using allergen ingredients as calibrants and stable isotope-labeled peptides as internal standards provided the most accurate quantitative results. The strategy was further verified with commercially available reference materials and allowed for the confident detection and quantification of food allergens.

This study used headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to examine the differences in the peanut oil aroma on the basis of variety, roasting temperatures, and pressing components. The results revealed that the optimal conditions for extracting peanut oil were achieved through the use of 50/30 μm DVB/CAR/PDMS fibers at 60 °C for 50 min. The primary compounds present in peanut oil were pyrazines. When peanuts were roasted, the temperature raised from 120 °C to 140 °C and the content of aldehydes in peanut oil increased; however, the content of aldehydes in No. 9 oil at 160 °C decreased. The components of peanut shell oil varied depending on the peanut variety. The most marked difference was observed in terms of the main compound at the two roasting temperatures. This compound was a pyrazine, and the content increased with the roasting temperature in hekei oils. When the roasting temperature was lower, No. 9 oil contained more fatty acid oxidation products such as hexanal, heptanal, and nonanal.

Very few studies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have studied blood lead levels (BLLs) and non-gasoline sources of exposure in children. Data from a birth cohort in Benin (2011-2013) suggested that 58% of 1-year-old children had BLLs > 50 ug/L. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of elevated BLLs (>50 µg/L and >100 µg /L) among 425 of these children at 6 years of age in 2016-2018 and to compare BLLs between age 1 and 6 years, and study sources of lead at age 6 years. BLLs were analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression and quantile regressions were used to study potential sources of lead. The prevalence of BLLs > 50 µg/L in children was 59.5% (Geometric Mean (GM) 56.4 µg/L, 95% CI: 54.1-58.7) at 6 years of age compared to 54.8% (GM 56.5 µg/L, 95% CI: 53.4-59.6) at 1 year of age. The prevalence of children with BLLs > 100 µg/L decreased from 14.4% at 1 year of age to 8.2% at 6 years of age. After adjustment for all other covariates, consumption of peanuts more than once per month was significantly associated with a 22.0% (95% CI: 4.6, 42.5) increment in BLLs at age 6 years compared with no consumption. Consumption of bushmeat killed by lead bullets at age 6 years was associated with an increase in the higher percentiles of BLLs (P75) compared with the absence of this source.

33186497,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), chemicals frequently used in agriculture, are a group of highly toxic and persistent organic pollutants. This study assesses the distribution and congener profiles of residual OCPs in 11 types of vegetable oils collected from Chinese markets. All samples were extracted using the modified QuEChERS method prior to analysis by gas chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The sesame oil samples had the highest concentration of OCPs, within the range of 15.30-59.38 ng/g, whereas the peanut oil samples had the lowest OCP concentrations, within the range of 10.83-35.65 ng/g. The possible effect of the processing technology on the pesticide residues in these vegetable oils was also evaluated. It was found that the pressing method leaves more OCPs in vegetable oils than the aqueous extraction and cold-pressing, but the result for leaching was not obvious. In light of the obtained results, it was estimated that the average daily intake of different pesticides is between 0.01 and 2.20 ng/kg bw/day for urban and rural households. Hence, it can be affirmed that, given the amount of the concentration of OCPs detected in the vegetable oils collected from Chinese markets, there are no obvious health risks for urban and rural households by intake.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002681', 'D003257', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D006843', 'D010573', 'D010938']","['China', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plant Oils']",Analysis of Organochlorine Pesticide Residues in Various Vegetable Oils Collected in Chinese Markets.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186497,2021

32930255,"Aflatoxins (AFs), as the secondary metabolites of the toxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, are well known to be extremely harmful to humans and animals because of their high toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity. Recurring and increasing studies on AF ingestion incidents indicate that AF contamination is a serious food safety issue worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, the IAC method may be limited to some laboratories because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) clean-up method based on humic acids (HAs), which is followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAs could be directly used as a DSPE sorbent after simple treatment without any chemical modification. In the HA-DSPE, AFs could remain on the HA sorbent by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was retained on HA via only hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix could be sufficiently washed off by n-hexane, whereas the AFs could still be retained on HA; thus, the selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices were achieved. Under the optimal conditions of HA-DSPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.3% to 106.2% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices i.e. blended oil, mixed olive oil, tea oil, sunflower seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, rice oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. Minor matrix effects ranging from 89.3% to 112.9% were obtained for the four AFs, which were acceptable. Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.063 and 0.102 μg kg-1 completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union (EU), China, or other countries. The proposed methodology was further validated using a naturally contaminated peanut oil, and the results indicated that the accuracy of the HA-DSPE could match the accuracy of the referenced IAC. In addition, HA-DSPE can be used to directly treat diluted edible oil without liquid-liquid extraction and HA is cheap and can be easily obtained from the market worldwide; these advantages make the proposed methodology simple, low-cost, and accessible for the determination of AFs in edible oils.",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,"['D000348', 'D001230', 'D001231', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004042', 'D005504', 'D006812', 'D010938', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Aflatoxins', 'Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Humic Substances', 'Plant Oils', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Facile dispersive solid-phase extraction based on humic acid for the determination of aflatoxins in various edible oils.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930255,2021

32691795,"As plant proteins are increasingly used as a source of amino acids in the diet, studies on in vitro digestion of plant proteins are key to understand the different factors affecting proteolysis, with the ultimate goal of optimising the nutritional composition/intake of plant protein-rich products. More realistic scenarios including the most likely food matrix and physiologically relevant gastrointestinal (GI) conditions should be considered when assessing the in vitro digestion of proteins. The research described here compares the extent of hydrolysis of proteins from peanuts and wheat bread, in particular the vicilin-like 7S globulin (Ara h 1) and gliadin, respectively, with three GI scenarios simulating either infant, early phase adult (fed state) or late phase adult (fasted state) conditions. The digestibility of these proteins, in isolation or when naturally present in the respective food matrix, has been evaluated with SDS-PAGE, LC-MS/MS and a spectrophotometric assay. Results from the food matrices showed lower extent of total protein GI digestion under simulated infant conditions, intermediate behaviour under fed state adult conditions and larger extent under fasted state adult conditions. This was also the case for isolated gliadin. However, isolated Ara h 1 only showed lower extent of proteolysis in the gastric phase under infant conditions, reaching a similar extent to both adult conditions over the course of the intestinal phase.

Thus, it is important to understand the relationship between microorganisms to predict, manage and estimate the diversity in the peanut supply chain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate aflatoxin production during the co-cultivation of Aspergillus section Flavi and Salmonella both isolated from peanuts. Three strains of A. section Flavi: A. flavus producing aflatoxin B, A. flavus non-producing aflatoxin and A. parasiticus producing aflatoxin B and G were co-cultivated with seven serotypes of Salmonella of which six were isolated from the peanut supply chain (S. Muenster, S. Miami, S. Glostrup, S. Javiana, S. Oranienburg and S. Yoruba) and one was S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028. First of all, each Salmonella strain was inoculated by pour plate (ca. 5 log cfu/mL) in PDA (potato dextrose agar). Then, each pre-cultured fungus was inoculated in the center of the petri dish. The plates were incubated at 30 °C and the fungal colony diameter was measured once a day for 7 days. As a control each Aspergillus strain was cultivated in the absence of Salmonella culture. All three strains of Aspergillus with absence of Salmonella (control) reached the maximum colony diameter and their growth rate was influenced when co-cultivated (p < 0.05) with all Salmonella serotypes tested. The maximum inhibition in the colony diameter was 20% for A. flavus aflatoxin B producer and A. parasiticus, and 18% for A. flavus non- aflatoxin producer when cultivated with Salmonella. However, no significant difference (p < 0.05) in reduction of colony diameter was observed among the Salmonella serotypes. Aflatoxin production was determined previously, by using the agar plug technique on thin layer chromatography (TLC). The production of aflatoxin G by A. parasiticus in co-cultivation with Salmonella was not observed. On the other hand, A. flavus preserved their characteristics of aflatoxin B production. The quantification of aflatoxin reduction by Salmonella interaction was evaluated using HPLC method. There was a maximum reduction of aflatoxin production of 88.7% and 72.9% in A. flavus and A. parasiticus, respectively, when cultivated with Salmonella.

Peptides similar to the 13cp in PN and TN allergens bound IgE from sera of patients allergic to PN and TN in peptide microarray analysis.

The cpAB bound more specifically to allergens and nut extracts containing multiple repeats similar to the 13 cp, such as almond (Pru du 6), peanut (Ara h 2) and walnut (Jug r 2). IgE binding to various nut extracts is inhibited by recombinant J2LS sequence and synthetic 31cp. Thus, several repeated sequences similar to the 13cp are bound by IgE.

The proteins of all the substrates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC-MS/MS. Individual amino acid composition was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). EAA/NEAA (essential amino acids/ nonessential amino acids) ratios in the substrates from low to high were as follows: wheat bran cereals, peanuts, collagen, zein, whey protein, sorghum, pigeon peas, and black beans. The results revealed sorghum, whey protein, and zein as good sources of BCAA. In all substrates, no intact protein from the substrates was visually detected by SDS-PAGE after the intestinal phase of in vitro digestion with the INFOGEST protocol.

32125467,"Peanut is a major cause of severe IgE-mediated food allergic reactions, which can be exacerbated by factors, such as exercise, that may increase allergen uptake into the circulation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been used to determine allergen uptake into serum, but there are concerns over their specificity and a confirmatory method is required. Mass spectrometry (MS) methods have the potential to provide rigorous alternatives for allergen determination. A suite of peptide targets representing the major clinically relevant peanut allergens previously applied in food analysis were used to develop a targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method for determination of peanut in serum. Depletion of serum using affinity chromatography was found to be essential to allow detection of the peptide targets. A comparison of triple quadrupole and Q-TOF methods showed that one Ara h 2 peptide was only detected by the Q-TOF, the other peptide targets giving similar assay sensitivities with both MS platforms, although transitions for all the peptides were detected more consistently with the Q-TOF. The Q-TOF MRM assay detected peanut from spiked serum more effectively than the triple quadrupole assay, with Ara h 3 being detected down to 3 mg total peanut protein/L of serum, comparable with an Ara h 3-specific ELISA. The poor recoveries observed for both methods are likely due to loss of peanut immune complexes during the serum depletion process. Nevertheless, the Q-TOF MRM method has much promise to confirm the uptake of peanut proteins in serum samples providing immune complexes can be disrupted effectively prior to depletion.

The objective of this research was to characterize umami fractions obtained by ultrafiltration and chromatography of both oncoms. The first step, water-soluble extracts of oncoms were ultrafiltered using a membrane with cutoff 3,000 Da and followed by gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G-25) to obtain umami fractions. Ultrafiltration fractions of red oncom (molecular weight [MW] less than 3,000 Da) and black oncom (MW more than 3,000 Da) had an intense umami taste. The further fractionation by gel filtration chromatography linked to taste dilution analysis yielded umami fractions. Chemical characterization revealed that free glutamic acid, free phenylalanine, and peptides containing their residual amino acids were present in the fractions.

Our aim was identification, purification of Buchanania lanzan (Bl-11 kDa) protein along with characterization and assessment of allergenic potential of clinically relevant allergen. Further study was executed in clinical samples of sensitive patients, BALB/c mice, and in-vitro. A major IgE binding 11-kDa protein from Buchanania lanzan was purified by anion exchange chromatography, reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and characterized using peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). Buchanania lanzan (Bl-11 kDa) protein shows the pepsin resistance and depicts IgE interacting capacity to Buchanania lanzan allergic patient's sera as well as sensitized mice sera. It also showed increase in the allergic mediator's like IgE, IgG1, histamine levels in sensitized mice sera. Further study was carried out in-vitro (RBL-2H3 cells) and increased release mast cell degranulation mediators such as β-hexosaminidase, histamine, CysL and PGD2 in the culture supernatant was found. The activation of Th2 cytokines/transcription factors and expression of molecular markers in the downstream of mast cell signaling were up-regulated while the Th1 transcriptional factor (T-bet) was decreased in Bl-11 kDa protein treated mice.

31162510,"Peanuts are a source of proteins and fats but they are also considered a harmful food for individuals who are allergic to them due to their ability to trigger severe and life-threatening reactions. Strict avoidance of peanuts is the most effective means to prevent the development of an allergic reaction. Physical or chemical strategies employing autoclaving can represent a valid alternative to produce a final food with a decreased allergenic power as in the case of peanuts. Thermal processing might induce protein modifications in foods and affect protein digestibility or absorption of nutrients across the intestinal mucosa. Besides, the type of processing could also alter food protein allergenicity thus influencing the interplay with the biological system at the gut level. In this paper, we investigated the influence of autoclaving based treatments on the proliferation of epithelial cells at the intestinal level. Extractable proteins of raw and autoclaved peanuts were analysed by SDS-PAGE and untargeted LC-high resolution-MS/MS to investigate the peptide composition. Our findings show that when raw peanuts were assayed on Caco 2 cell lines, an antiproliferative effect was observed. By contrast, peanuts subjected to hydration and autoclaving did not show an inhibition of proliferation on Caco-2 cells. In parallel, extensive fragmentation induced by autoclaving treatments on the original peanut proteins was also recorded by LC-MS/MS analysis with a consequent increase in the number of peptides detected. These results indicate that the processing applied to peanuts can have an influence on both the nutritional and allergological sides, and more investigations will be required on this issue to understand the alteration of inflammatory mediators induced by the treatment applied.",Food & function,"['D000485', 'D010367', 'D018938', 'D049109', 'D002853', 'D003296', 'D004847', 'D006358', 'D006801', 'D010940', 'D012639', 'D053719']","['Allergens', 'Arachis', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cooking', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Plant Proteins', 'Seeds', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Investigation on the allergen profile of the soluble fraction of autoclaved peanuts and its interaction with Caco-2 cells.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000166', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'cytology', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162510,2019

As a result, the sensory properties of peanut varieties, especially in southern Africa, are not known. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to determine the sensory properties of the Malawi peanut varieties and the volatile compounds associated with roasted peanut flavor. Six dominant Malawi peanut varieties (Chalimbana, CG7, Nsinjiro, Kakoma, Baka, and Chitala) were evaluated in this study. All peanut samples were shelled and then, roasted in a convection oven to reach medium doneness as indicated by the surface color lightness (L) value of approximately 50. A hybrid descriptive analysis (DA) was done to determine the sensory profile of the roasted peanuts. Volatile compounds were extracted from equilibrated ground peanut sample using headspace-solid phase microextraction technique and analyzed by GC-MS. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of the DA data showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in the sensory profiles of the peanut varieties. Nsinjiro and Baka had a significantly higher intensity of roasted peanutty aroma and flavor (P < 0.05). The GC-MS results showed that pyrazines and furans were the dominant volatile compounds but, their respective concentrations, in the evaluated peanut varieties, were significantly different (P < 0.05). Among the pyrazines, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl pyrazine was strongly correlated with roasted peanutty flavor (r = 0.927) just like 2,5 dimethyl pyrazine (r = 0.916). Therefore, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl pyrazine and 2,5-dimethyl pyrazine production pathways could provide more insights into the origins of roasted peanut flavor.

The saturated adsorption of ochratoxin A by aptamer-modified magnetic MIL-101 was 7.9 times greater than that by magnetic metal-organic framework MIL-101 due to the former's high selective recognition as well as good stability.

30408562,"Food allergies are a growing worldwide concern and the contamination of products with food allergens represents a significant health risk to allergic consumers. With the introduction of reference doses, quantitative methods are needed for the monitoring of allergen levels, and the potential of LC-MS/MS is of hugely growing interest. In this study, we demonstrate that relevant food matrices (bakery products and chocolates) and thermal food processing substantially influence the quantification of 18 marker peptides from various nut and peanut allergens via targeted proteomics. In addition, we characterize the individual release kinetics of marker peptides and provide examples for metastable marker peptide candidates. Matrix recovery rates overall ranged between 15 and 250% with the observed variation being linked to the individual peptide structure as well as to specific matrix interferences. In contrast, thermal processing considerably influences the detectability of allergens on the protein level as different marker peptides from the identical parent allergen are similarly affected, leading to a loss in signal of up to 83% in extreme cases after a 45-min simulated baking. Provided data are finally used for evaluation of different calibrators as well as the overall potential and challenges of LC-MS for the absolute quantification of food allergens. SIGNIFICANCE: With the scientific discussion moving towards a risk-based management of food allergens, including the establishment of threshold doses, robust methods for the absolute quantification of allergens in food samples are urgently needed. Because the currently used antibody- and DNA-based technologies show severe limitations in terms of specificity and reproducibility, LC-MS has emerged as a promising alternative. Its application to absolute quantification, however, first requires an understanding of the various impacts that affect quantification results, including different food matrices, sample preparation, and thermal processing of foodstuffs.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the 47 kDa grass pea protein revealed sequence homology to 47 kDa vicilin from pea and Len c 1 from lentil. Interestingly the grass pea vicilin was found to be susceptible to pepsin digestion in vitro. We have also isolated a cDNA encoding the grass pea 47 kDa vicilin (β-lathyrin), and the deduced amino acid sequence revealed extensive homology to several known allergens, including those from peanut and soybean. A homology model structure of the grass pea β-lathyrin, generated using the X-ray crystal structure of the soybean β-conglycinin β subunit as a template, revealed potential IgE-binding epitopes located on the surface of the molecule. The similarity in the three-dimensional structure and the conservation of the antigenic epitopes on the molecular surface of vicilin allergens explains the IgE-binding cross-reactivity.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000485', 'D010367', 'D005512', 'D006023', 'D006801', 'D007073', 'D027807', 'D027806', 'D013058', 'D010940', 'D055314']","['Allergens', 'Arachis', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Lathyrus', 'Lens Plant', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Plant Proteins', 'Seed Storage Proteins']","Identification and Characterization of β-Lathyrin, an Abundant Glycoprotein of Grass Pea ( Lathyrus sativus L.), as a Potential Allergen.","['Q000737', 'Q000235', 'Q000276', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'genetics', 'immunology', 'chemistry', None, 'immunology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30052442,2018
29912639,"The peanut supply chain in Malaysia is dominated by three main stakeholders (importers, manufacturers, retailers). The present study aimed to determine the levels and critical points of aflatoxin and fungal contamination in peanuts along the supply chain. Specifically, two types of raw peanuts and six types of peanut-based products were collected (N = 178). Samples were analysed for aflatoxins by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results revealed that the aflatoxin contamination was significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) in raw peanuts and peanut-based products from the retailers. However, there was no significant difference (P ≥ 0.05) in fungal contamination for both types of peanuts except for the total fungal count in raw peanuts from the retailers. Furthermore, raw peanut kernels from the retailers were the most contaminated ones ranged from <LOD to 1021.4 µg/kg (mean: 120.7 µg/kg, median: 1.4 µg/kg) followed by the samples collected from the manufacturers which was ranged from < LOD to 181.9 µg/kg (mean: 20.5 µg/kg, median: 0.0 µg/kg). About 38% and 22% of the samples from the retailers and manufacturers were found to have exceeded the Malaysian Regulation limit (raw peanuts:15 µg/kg; peanut-based products:10 µg/kg), respectively. In contrast, no aflatoxins were detected in samples from the importers. On the other hand, 15.0% and 5.9% of peanut-based products from retailers and manufacturers, respectively, were found to have exceeded the limit. Fungal contamination (0.3-3.6 log CFU/g) was relatively higher in raw peanuts compared to that of peanut-based products (0.6-2.7 log CFU/g). In conclusion, the manufacturers and retailers were the critical points for aflatoxin contamination in peanuts. However, fungal contamination was more critical in the raw peanuts compared to peanut-based products. The study was limited by a minimal number of samples from the importer. Therefore, further investigations on a larger sample size should be conducted to confirm the findings in this present study.","Food additives & contaminants.

In this investigation, performance provided by a high resolution (HR) hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap™ MS platform for the multiple allergens detection in processed food matrix is presented. In particular, three different acquisition modes were compared: full-MS, targeted-selected ion monitoring with data-dependent fragmentation (t-SIM/dd2), and parallel reaction monitoring. In order to challenge the HR-MS platform, the sample preparation was kept as simple as possible, limited to a 30-min ultrasound-aided protein extraction followed by clean-up with disposable size exclusion cartridges. Selected peptide markers tracing for five allergenic ingredients namely skim milk, whole egg, soy flour, ground hazelnut, and ground peanut were monitored in home-made cookies chosen as model processed matrix. Timed t-SIM/dd2 was found the best choice as a good compromise between sensitivity and accuracy, accomplishing the detection of 17 peptides originating from the five allergens in the same run.

29389948,"Multiplex serological immunoassays, such as implemented on microarray or microsphere-based platforms, provide greater information content and higher throughput, while lowering the cost and blood volume required. These features are particularly attractive in pediatric food allergy testing to facilitate high throughput multi-allergen analysis from finger- or heel-stick collected blood. However, the miniaturization and microfluidics necessary for creating multiplex assays make them highly susceptible to the ""matrix effect"" caused by interference from non-target agents in serum and other biofluids. Such interference can result in lower sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and quantitative accuracy. These problems have in large part prevented wide-spread implementation of multiplex immunoassays in clinical laboratories. We report the development of a novel method to eliminate the matrix effect by utilizing photocleavable capture antibodies to purify and concentrate blood-based biomarkers (a process termed PC-PURE) prior to detection in a multiplex immunoassay. To evaluate this approach, it was applied to blood-based allergy testing. Patient total IgE was purified and enriched using PC-PURE followed by multiplex microsphere-based detection of allergen-specific IgEs (termed the AllerBead assay). AllerBead was formatted to detect the eight most common pediatric food allergens: milk, soy, wheat, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fin fish and shellfish, which account for >90% of all pediatric food allergies. 205 serum samples obtained from Boston Children's Hospital were evaluated. When PC-PURE was employed with AllerBead, excellent agreement was obtained with the standard, non-multiplex, ImmunoCAP® assay (average sensitivity above published negative predictive cutoffs = 96% and average Pearson r = 0.90; average specificity = 97%). In contrast, poor ImmunoCAP®-correlation was observed when PC-PURE was not utilized (average sensitivity above published negative predictive cutoffs = 59% and average Pearson r = 0.61; average specificity = 97%).

29370131,"Adulteration of edible oils has attracted attention from more researchers and consumers in recent years. Complex multispecies adulteration is a commonly used strategy to mask the traditional adulteration detection methods. Most of the researchers were only concerned about single targeted adulterants, however, it was difficult to identify complex multispecies adulteration or untargeted adulterants. To detect adulteration of edible oil, identification of characteristic markers of adulterants was proposed to be an effective method, which could provide a solution for multispecies adulteration detection. In this study, a simple method of multispecies adulteration detection for camellia oil (adulterated with soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil) was developed by quantifying chemical markers including four isoflavones, trans-resveratrol and sinapic acid, which used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) combined with solid phase extraction (SPE). In commercial camellia oil, only two of them were detected of daidzin with the average content of 0.06 ng/g while other markers were absent. The developed method was highly sensitive as the limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.02 ng/mL to 0.16 ng/mL and the mean recoveries ranged from 79.7% to 113.5%, indicating that this method was reliable to detect potential characteristic markers in edible oils. Six target compounds for pure camellia oils, soybean oils, peanut oils and rapeseed oils had been analyzed to get the results.

29202922,"There is currently no cure for food allergies, and sufferers can only rely on the correct labeling of foods to avoid allergens. Hence, it is important that analytical methods are sensitive and accurate enough to screen for the presence of multiple allergens in food products. In this study, we developed an LC-tandem MS method that is able to simultaneously screen or quantify the signature tryptic peptides of multiple allergen commodities. This method is capable of screening and identifying egg white, skim milk, peanut, soy, and tree nuts (almond, Brazil nut, cashew, hazelnut, pecan, pine nut, pistachio, and walnut) at a detection limit of 10 ppm in incurred bread and cookies.

Although several studies optimized LC-MS detection strategies specific for peanuts, the presence of complex components in the spices (e.g., phenolic components) makes method optimization and validation necessarily. Focus was laid on validation of the method with real incurred chili peppers (whereby a known amount of peanut is added) at low concentrations, to deal with possible matrix interferences.

28725476,"Food allergy prevalence is rising worldwide, motivating the development of assays that can sensitively and reliably detect trace amounts of allergens in manufactured food. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a promising alternative to commonly employed antibody-based assays owing to its ability to quantify multiple proteins in complex matrices with high sensitivity. In this review, we discuss a targeted MS workflow for the quantitation of allergenic protein in food products that employs selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We highlight the aspects of SRM method development unique to allergen quantitation and identify opportunities for simplifying the process. One promising avenue identified through a comprehensive survey of published MS literature is the use of proteotypic peptides, which are peptides whose presence appears robust to variations in food matrix, sample preparation protocol, and MS instrumentation. We conclude that proteotypic peptides exist for a subset of allergenic milk, egg, and peanut proteins. For less studied allergens such as soy, wheat, fish, shellfish, and tree nuts, we offer guidance and tools for peptide selection and specificity verification as part of an interactive web database, the Allergen Peptide Browser (http://www.AllergenPeptideBrowser.org).

28506119,"Aflatoxins are among the most powerful carcinogens in nature. The major aflatoxin-producing fungi are Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. Numerous crops, including peanut, are susceptible to aflatoxin contamination by these fungi. There has been an increased use of RNA interference (RNAi) technology to control phytopathogenic fungi in recent years. In order to develop molecular tools targeting specific genes of these fungi for the control of aflatoxins, it is necessary to obtain their genome sequences. Although high-throughput sequencing is readily available, it is still impractical to sequence the genome of every isolate. Thus, in this work, the authors proposed a workflow that allowed prescreening of 238 Aspergillus section Flavi isolates from peanut seeds from Georgia, USA. The aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster (ABC) of the isolates was fingerprinted at 25 InDel (insertion/deletion) loci using capillary electrophoresis. All isolates were tested for aflatoxins using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. The neighbor-joining, three-dimension (3D) principal coordinate, and Structure analyses revealed that the Aspergillus isolates sampled consisted of three main groups determined by their capability to produce aflatoxins. Group I comprised 10 non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus; Group II included A. parasiticus; and Group III included mostly aflatoxigenic A. flavus and the three non-aflatoxigenic A. caelatus. Whole genomes of 10 representative isolates from different groups were sequenced. Although InDels in Aspergillus have been used by other research groups, this is the first time that the cluster analysis resulting from fingerprinting was followed by whole-genome sequencing of representative isolates. In our study, cluster analysis of ABC sequences validated the results obtained with fingerprinting. This shows that InDels used here can predict similarities at the genome level. Our results also revealed a relationship between groups and their capability to produce aflatoxins.

We report on the isolation and characterization of a VOCs-emitting endophytic fungus, isolated from an olive tree (Olea europaea L.) growing in Israel; the isolate was identified as Daldinia cf. concentrica. We found that the emitted VOCs were active against various fungi from diverse phyla. Results from postharvest experiments demonstrated that D. cf. concentrica prevented development of molds on organic dried fruits, and eliminated Aspergillus niger infection in peanuts. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the volatiles led to identification of 27 VOCs. On the basis of these VOCs we prepared two mixtures that displayed a broad spectrum of antifungal activity. In postharvest experiments these mixtures prevented development of molds on wheat grains, and fully eliminated A. niger infection in peanuts.

However, the degradation products of aflatoxins under UV irradiation and their safety or toxicity have not been clear in practical production such as edible oil industry. In this study, the degradation products of aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) in peanut oil were analyzed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph-Thermo Quadrupole Exactive Focus mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQEF-MS/MS). The high-resolution mass spectra reflected that two main products were formed after the modification of a double bond in the terminal furan ring and the fracture of the lactone ring, while the small molecules especially nitrogen-containing compound may have participated in the photochemical reaction. According to the above results, the possible photodegradation pathway of AFB₁ in peanut oil is proposed.

It also contributed to maintenance of normal morphological features and inhibited malondialdehyde formation and the lactate dehydrogenase release in erythrocytes under oxidative stress. Further analysis revealed that caffeic acid effectively inhibited AAPH-induced free-radical production and maintained the normal metabolism of the erythrocytic redox system, including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione.

After preparation of 2-amino-6-(3-methylpyridin-1-ium-1-yl)hexanoic acid (MP-lysine) as reference material, its amounts were quantitated in acrolein-modified peanut proteins by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS after acid hydrolysis, showing that at low acrolein concentrations, the modification of lysine could be entirely explained by the formation of MP-lysine. Furthermore, for the first time, MP-lysine was quantitated in peanut samples in amounts up to 10.2 mg/kg, showing an increase depending on the roasting time. Thus, MP-lysine might represent a marker to evaluate the extent of food protein lipation by acrolein.

27476797,"In this work, novel hybrid nanostructured surfaces, consisting of dense arrays of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) functionalized by Ag nanoparticles (AgNP/SiNWs), were used for the laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LDI-TOF MS) analysis of some typical unsaturated food components (e.g. squalene, oleic acid) to assess their MS performance. The synthesis of the novel platforms is an easy, cost-effective process based on the maskless wet-etching preparation at room temperature of SiNWs followed by their decoration with AgNPs, produced by pulsed laser deposition. No particular surface pretreatment or addition of organic matrixes/ionizers was necessary. Moreover, oil extracts (e.g. extra virgin olive oil, peanut oil) could be investigated on AgNP/SiNWs surfaces, revealing their different MS profiles. It was shown that such substrates operate at reduced laser energy, typically generating intense silver cluster ions and analyte adducts. A comparison with bare SiNWs was also performed, indicating the importance of AgNP density on NW surface. In this case, desorption/ionization on silicon was invoked as probable LDI mechanism. Finally, the influence of SiNW length and surface composition on MS results was assessed. The combination of typical properties of SiNWs (hydrophobicity, antireflectivity) with ionization ability of metal NPs can be a valid methodology for the further development of nanostructured surfaces in LDI-TOF MS applications.

The results demonstrated that boiling, glycation and frying induced the down-regulation of the allergenicity of Ara h 2 in Balb/c mice, the collapse of its tertiary/secondary structure, and a reduction in the core epitope binding capacity; roasting showed a comparable allergenicity and the weakest inhibitory effect on core epitope binding capacity.

Four proteins: glutamine ammonia ligase, chitin class II, actin isoform B, and beta tubulin, involved in metabolism, defense and cellular biogenesis, are unique in tolerant cultivar and showed positive interactions with other proteins. In addition, four proteins: serine/threonine protein phosphate PP1, choline monooxygenase, peroxidase 43, and SNF1-related protein kinase regulatory subunit beta-2, that play a role as cryoprotectants through signal transduction, were induced in drought tolerant cultivar following WS.

The optimization step of the hydride generation was performed using a two-level full factorial design involving the parameters: hydrochloric acid, sodium tetrahydroborate and potassium iodide concentrations. So, using the chemical conditions optimized, this method allows the determination of these elements employing the external calibration technique using aqueous standards with limits of detection and quantification of 0.04 and 0.14µgL(-1) for antimony, 0.04 and 0.14µgL(-1) for arsenic and 0.14 and 0.37µgL(-1) for selenium, respectively. Additionally, the effect of vanadium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, zinc, copper, iron and molybdenum on the generation of chemical vapour was also studied. The precision expressed as relative standard deviation varied from 1.2 to 3.6% for antimony, 1.8-3.9% for arsenic and 1.8-2% for selenium. The accuracy for arsenic and selenium was confirmed using the certified peach leaves reference material SRM 1547 produced by National Institute of Standard and Technology. The proposed method showed 45 injection throughput (h(-1)) using 1.6mL sample volume for each element, 0.8mL NaBH4 0.5% (w/v) containing NaOH 0.05% (w/v), 0.8mL HCl 5M and 0.4mL KI 14% (w/v) containing L-ascorbic acid 2.5% (w/v).

27146636,"Aflatoxins (AFs) are hepatocarcinogenic mycotoxins that can contaminate grains and oil seeds in tropical and sub-tropical areas and have been detected in maize and peanut products of Haiti. The first objective was to assess human exposure to AFs among Haitians at an urban hospital (GHESKIO) and a rural health centre (HCBH). The second objective was to test the association between AF exposure and reported dietary intake of potentially contaminated foods, such as maize, peanut products and milk. Measurement of urinary AFM1 by HPLC revealed that among 367 participants 14% and 22% at GHESKIO and HCBH, respectively, had detectable AFM1. The maximum and median AFM1 concentrations for all detected samples were 700 pg AFM1 ml(-1) and 11.7 pg ml(-1), respectively. Detection of AFM1 was significantly associated with peanut consumption (p < 0.05). Controlling for diet and age group in a logit model, patients who reported peanut consumption the day of the survey and patients from HCBH had greater log odds of excreting detectable AFM1 (p < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively); females had lower log odds (p = 0.020). Recalled frequency of consuming non-dairy animal-sourced foods, an indicator of diet quality, approached significance (p = 0.056) as an inverse predictor of urinary AFM1 detection. The findings augur the need for interventions that will improve food safety in Haiti and limit exposure to AFs, particularly among rural communities. ","Food additives & contaminants.

Whilst targeted methods are likely to offer the most robust approach for detection and quantification, little is known about how food processing may affect the behaviour of peptide targets. A systematic study has been undertaken to investigate the effects of thermal processing (boiling, roasting, frying) on the behaviour of a suite of peanut peptide targets representing the major clinically-relevant allergens. Initially the effect of thermal processing on protein extractability was investigated and a mass spectrometry-compatible buffer identified comprising 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 containing 50 mM dithiothreitol and 0.04% (w/v) acid labile detergent which was able to extract 45-100% of protein from raw, boiled, roasted and fried peanuts using sonication at 60 °C. Eight peptide targets were identified including two peptides from each cupin allergen, Ara h1 and Ara h3 and four peptides from the prolamin superfamily allergens Ara h2, 6 and 7. AQUA peptide standards were synthesised and used to undertake multiple-reaction monitoring experiments, giving assay sensitivities of 0.1-30 amoles of peptide on-column (3 : 1 signal : noise), calculated limits of quantification between 96-1343 amoles of peptide on-column and a linear dynamic range of 4-5 orders of magnitude. Absolute quantification of individual peanut allergens in thermally processed samples showed that peptide targets in the cupin allergens were more prone to processing-induced effects than those from Ara h2, 6 and 7. Targets flanked by arginine residues showed greater thermostability. Identification of processing-stable targets, coupled with more efficient extraction procedures and a wide dynamic range, shows that targeted mass spectrometry methods have great potential as an additional method for quantifying peanut allergens in complex food matrices.

A cDNA library was constructed from seven stages of developing soybean seeds to investigate candidate allergens. We searched the library for cDNAs encoding a seed-specific biotinylated protein (SBP) based on its allergenicity in boiled lentils. A full-length cDNA clone was retrieved and expressed as a 75.6-kDa His-tagged recombinant protein (rSBP) in Escherichia coli. Western immunoblotting of boiled bacterial extracts demonstrated specific IgE binding to rSBP, which was further purified by metal affinity and anion exchange chromatographies. Of the 23 allergic sera screened by ELISA, 12 contained IgEs specific to the purified rSBP. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a predominantly unordered structure consistent with SBP's heat stability. The natural homologues (nSBP) were the main proteins isolated from soybean and peanut embryos after streptavidin affinity purification, yet they remained low-abundance proteins in the seed as confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Using capture ELISAs, the soybean and peanut nSBPs were bound by IgEs in 78 and 87% of the allergic sera tested. The soybean nSBP was purified to homogeneity and treatments with different denaturing agents before immunoblotting highlighted the diversity of its IgE epitopes. In vitro activation of basophils was assessed by flow cytometry in a cohort of peanut-allergic children sensitized to soybean.

27002610,"A toxin-free enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for aflatoxins was developed using an anti-idiotype nanobody VHH 2-5 as surrogate standard. Anti-idiotype nanobody VHH 2-5 was generated by immunizing an alpaca with anti-aflatoxin monoclonal antibody 1C11. This assay was used to detect aflatoxins in agro-products after a simple extraction with 75 % methanol/H2O. Aflatoxin concentration was calculated by a two-step approach: the concentration of VHH 2-5 was first obtained by a four-parameter logistic regression from the detected absorbance value at 450 nm, and then converted to aflatoxin concentration by a linear equation. The assay exhibits a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.015 ng mL(-1), which is better than or comparable with conventional immunoassays. The performance of our VHH surrogate-based ELISA was further validated with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for total aflatoxins determination in 20 naturally contaminated peanut samples, displaying a good correlation (R (2) = 0.988). In conclusion, the proposed assay represents a first example applying an anti-idiotype VHH antibody as a standard surrogate in ELISA.

26948441,"Mycotoxins usually found in agricultural products such as peanut, corn, and wheat, are a serious threat to human health and their detection requires multiplexed and sensitive analysis methods. Herein, a simultaneous determination for aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2, ochratoxin A, zearalanone and T-2 toxin was investigated using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in a single run via a home-made multiple immunoaffinity column. Four monoclonal antibodies were produced in our lab against aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, zearalanone and T-2 toxin, respectively, then combined as a pool and bound to Sepharose-4B for affinity chromatography. Seven mycotoxins were effectively extracted from the agricultural product samples by using acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (80:19:1, v/v/v) Then, the extraction was cleanup by multiple immunoaffinity column. This method demonstrated a considerable linear range of 0.30-25, 0.12-20, 0.30-20, 0.12-20, 0.60-30, 0.30-25, and 1.2-40μgkg(-1)and lower limits of detection at 0.1, 0.04, 0.1, 0.04, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.4μgkg(-1) for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, OTA, ZEN and T-2, respectively, in comparison with previously reported methods, as well as excellent recoveries. The mIAC capacity for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, OTA, ZEN, and T-2 were 187, 181, 153, 151, 105, 130, 88ng, respectively. It was found that all of the 7 mycotoxins were present in 90 agricultural product samples. The proposed method meets the requirements for rapid sample preparation and highly sensitive identification of multiple mycotoxins in agricultural product and food safety. This method provides a promising alternative with high throughput and high sensitivity for rapid analysis of seven mycotoxins in the monitoring of food safety. ","Journal of chromatography.

26921497,"Four different market classes of peanut (Runner, Virginia Spanish, and Valencia) are commonly consumed in Western countries, but for some consumers peanuts are a main cause of food-induced anaphylaxis. Limited information is available on the comparative allergenicity of these distinct market classes. The aim of this study was to compare allergenicity attributes of different peanut cultivars. The protein content and protein profiles were highly comparable for all tested cultivars. All cultivar samples contained the major allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and Ara h 6, as assessed by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC, although some minor differences in major allergen content were found between samples. All samples were reactive in commercial ELISAs for detection and quantification of peanut protein. IgE-binding potency differed between samples with a maximum factor of 2, indicating a highly comparable allergenicity. Based on our observations, we conclude that peanuts from the main market types consumed in Western countries are highly comparable in their allergenicity attributes, indicating that safety considerations with regard to peanut allergy are not dependent on the peanut cultivar in question.",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"['D000485', 'D010367', 'D002851', 'D004591', 'D004797']","['Allergens', 'Arachis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay']",Allergenicity attributes of different peanut market types.,"['Q000737', 'Q000276', None, None, None]","['chemistry', 'immunology', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26921497,2016
26894851,"Supercritical fluid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) is an effective tool in separation science which uses the nontoxic CO2 fluid for better control of analyte retention. Also the technology of a postcolumn additive to complement MS/MS ensure the high-selectivity determination. In this paper, a green and sensitive analytical method was developed for the enantioselective separation and determination of isofenphos-methyl enantiomers in foodstuff and soil by SFC-MS/MS. The enantioseparation was performed within 3.50 min using Chiralpak IA-3 column with CO2/isopropanol (90:10, v/v) as the mobile phase at 2.2 mL/min flow rate. The postcolumn compensation technology provided with 0.1% formic acid/methanol greatly improved the ionization efficiency of mass spectrometry. Column temperature, auto back pressure regulator pressure, and flow rate of compensation solvent were optimized to 30 °C, 2200 psi, and 0.1 mL/min, respectively. The QuEChERs method was adopted in this study, which mean recoveries of isofenphos-methyl enantiomers ranged from 75.7% to 111.4%, with relative standard deviations less than 11.3% at three concentration levels in all matrices. The limits of detection for both enantiomers varied from 0.02 μg/kg to 0.15 μg/kg, while the limit of quantification did not exceed 0.50 μg/kg. The proposed method was then successfully applied to analyze authentic samples, confirming that it was a versatile strategy for the analysis of isofenphos-methyl enantiomers in food and environmental matrices.","Journal of chromatography.

26769163,"Beginning in the autumn of 2014, millions of dollars of food and over 675 products were recalled in the United States due to the presence of undeclared peanut, attributed to cumin used in the manufacture of the products. Initial analyses also indicated the presence of almond. Subsequent research showed that the presence of peanut and almond did not fully explain the analytical results for the cumin samples. Using a combination of mass spectrometry, DNA-based methods (i.e., PCR and Sanger DNA Sequencing), microscopy, and antibody-based technologies (i.e., ELISA, Western blot analysis, and a novel xMAP multiplex assay) the presence of peanut was confirmed. Screening for secondary sources of adulteration (e.g., tree nuts, mahleb, peach, and cherry) supported the assessment that the cumin contained multiple contaminants. These results demonstrate the limitations of single analyte-specific assays and the need for orthogonal multiplex methods to detect food allergens irrespective of varietal or other differences.

28911397,"Mycotoxins are toxic food contaminants that are naturally produced by certain fungi. They induce negative effects on human health by making food unsafe for consumption. In this study, analyses were performed to determine the levels and incidence of aflatoxins (AFs) in peanut products, tree nuts, spices, and Coix seeds; ochratoxin A (OTA) in wheat and roasted coffee, as well as OTA and AFs in rice; and citrinin (CIT) in red yeast rice (RYR) products. A total of 712 samples from nine different food categories were collected between 2012 and 2013. The samples were analyzed over 2 years for AFs, OTA, and CIT by methods recommended by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. These official analytical methods were extensively validated in-house and through interlaboratory trials. The analytical values of suspected contaminated specimens were confirmed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify the specific mycotoxin present in the sample. We show that 689 samples (96.8%) complied with the regulations set by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. AFs were found in four peanut-candy products, one peanut-flour product, one pistachio product, one Sichuan-pepper product, and one Coix seed product. All had exceeded the maximum levels of 15 parts per billion for peanut and 10 parts per billion for other food products. Furthermore, 14 RYR samples contained CIT above 5 parts per million, and one RYR tablet exceeded the maximum amount allowed. Instances of AFs in substandard Sichuan pepper and Coix seeds were first detected in Taiwan. Measures were taken by the relevant authorities to remove substandard products from the market in order to decrease consumer exposure to mycotoxin. Border control measures were applied to importing food commodities with a higher risk of mycotoxin contamination, such as peanut, Sichuan pepper, and RYR products. Declining trends were observed in the noncompliance rate of AFs in peanut products, as well as that of CIT in RYR raw materials monitored from 2010 to 2013.",Journal of food and drug analysis,[],[],Mycotoxin monitoring for commercial foodstuffs in Taiwan.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28911397,2019
26709851,"The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that 25% of the food crops in the world are contaminated with aflatoxins. That represents 100 million tons of food being destroyed or diverted to non-human consumption each year. Aflatoxins are powerful carcinogens normally accumulated by the fungi Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus in cereals, nuts, root crops and other agricultural products. Silencing of five aflatoxin-synthesis genes by RNA interference (RNAi) in peanut plants was used to control aflatoxin accumulation following inoculation with A. flavus. Previously, no method existed to analyze the effectiveness of RNAi in individual peanut transgenic events, as these usually produce few seeds, and traditional methods of large field experiments under aflatoxin-conducive conditions were not an option. In the field, the probability of finding naturally contaminated seeds is often 1/100 to 1/1,000. In addition, aflatoxin contamination is not uniformly distributed. Our method uses few seeds per transgenic event, with small pieces processed for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) or small RNA sequencing, and for analysis of aflatoxin accumulation by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). RNAi-expressing peanut lines 288-72 and 288-74, showed up to 100% reduction (p ≤ 0.01) in aflatoxin B1 and B2 compared to the control that accumulated up to 14,000 ng · g(-1) of aflatoxin B1 when inoculated with aflatoxigenic A. flavus. As reference, the maximum total of aflatoxins allowable for human consumption in the United States is 20 ng · g(-1). This protocol describes the application of RNAi-mediated control of aflatoxins in transgenic peanut seeds and methods for its evaluation. We believe that its application in breeding of peanut and other crops will bring rapid advancement in this important area of science, medicine and human nutrition, and will significantly contribute to the international effort to control aflatoxins, and potentially other mycotoxins in major food crops.",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"['D000348', 'D010367', 'D001231', 'D002853', 'D018556', 'D015870', 'D034622', 'D060888', 'D012639', 'D019076']","['Aflatoxins', 'Arachis', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'Gene Expression', 'RNA Interference', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seeds', 'Transgenes']",RNAi-mediated Control of Aflatoxins in Peanut: Method to Analyze Mycotoxin Production and Transgene Expression in the Peanut/Aspergillus Pathosystem.,"['Q000096', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None]","['biosynthesis', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26709851,2016

Several protein allergens, mainly water-soluble, have been described. We studied the non water-soluble fraction from these 4 food sources using immunoproteomics tools and techniques. Flour extracts were solubilized in detergent and chaotropes and analysed in 1 and 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D). Results showed numerous proteins exhibiting wide ranges of isoelectric points and relative molecular masses. When IgE immunoreactivities of 18 food allergy patients were individually tested in 1 and 2D western-blots, a very diversified IgE repertoire was observed, reflecting extensive cross-reactivities but also co-sensitizations. Besides already well known and characterized allergens, mass spectrometry analysis allowed the identification of 22 allergens undescribed until now: 10 in peanut, 2 in soybean, 3 in sesame and 7 in lentil. Three allergens are legume storage proteins and the others belong to transport proteins, nucleotide binding proteins and proteins involved in the regulation of metabolism. Seven proteins are potentially similar to allergens described in plants and fungi and 11 are not related to any known allergen.

The survey results found that the aflatoxin contamination of peanuts was significantly high in 2013. The determination coefficient (R²) of multiple regression reflected by the aflatoxin B₁ content with average precipitation and mean temperature in different periods showed that climatic conditions one month before harvest had the strongest impact on aflatoxin B₁ contamination, and that Hunan and Jiangxi provinces were greatly influenced.

At least two peptides were selected to represent peanut, almond, pecan, cashew, walnut, hazelnut, pine nut, Brazil nut, macadamia nut, pistachio nut, chestnut and coconut; to determine the presence of trace levels of peanut and tree nuts in food by a novel multiplexed LC-MS method.",Food chemistry,"['D010367', 'D002853', 'D009754', 'D010455', 'D053719']","['Arachis', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Nuts', 'Peptides', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Discovery of highly conserved unique peanut and tree nut peptides by LC-MS/MS for multi-allergen detection.,"['Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","['chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26471545,2016
26340625,"Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with its nutraceutical characteristics substantially contributes as a major nutrient to the health benefit of the Mediterranean diet. Unfortunately, the adulteration of EVOO with less expensive oils (e.g., peanut and corn oils), has become one of the biggest source of agricultural fraud in the European Union, with important health implications for consumers, mainly due to the introduction of seed oil-derived allergens causing, especially in children, severe food allergy phenomena. In this regard, revealing adulterations of EVOO is of fundamental importance for health care and prevention reasons, especially in children. To this aim, effective analytical methods to assess EVOO purity are necessary. Here, we propose a simple, rapid, robust and very sensitive method for non-specialized mass spectrometric laboratory, based on the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled to unsupervised hierarchical clustering (UHC), principal component (PCA) and Pearson's correlation analyses, to reveal corn oil (CO) adulterations in EVOO at very low levels (down to 0.5%).

The crude extract was prepared with acetone (60% v/v) and purified using chromatographic methods, including a semipreparative HPLC technique. As a result, two proanthocyanidins were isolated and identified using NMR, epicatechin-(2 β → O → 7, 4 β → 8)-catechin (proanthocyanidin A1) and epicatechin-(β → 2 O → 7, 4 β → 8)-epicatechin (proanthocyanidin A2).

26215119,"Parathion and chlorpyrifos are organophosphorus insecticides (OPs) that elicit acute toxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The endocannabinoids (eCBs, N-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA; 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2AG) are endogenous neuromodulators that regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release in neurons throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. While substantial information is known about the eCBs, less is known about a number of endocannabinoid-like metabolites (eCBLs, e.g., N-palmitoylethanolamine, PEA; N-oleoylethanolamine, OEA). We report the comparative effects of parathion and chlorpyrifos on AChE and enzymes responsible for inactivation of the eCBs, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), and changes in the eCBs AEA and 2AG and eCBLs PEA and OEA, in rat striatum. Adult, male rats were treated with vehicle (peanut oil, 2 ml/kg, sc), parathion (27 mg/kg) or chlorpyrifos (280 mg/kg) 6-7 days after surgical implantation of microdialysis cannulae into the right striatum, followed by microdialysis two or four days later. Additional rats were similarly treated and sacrificed for evaluation of tissue levels of eCBs and eCBLs. Dialysates and tissue extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. AChE and FAAH were extensively inhibited at both time-points (85-96%), while MAGL activity was significantly but lesser affected (37-62% inhibition) by parathion and chlorpyrifos. Signs of toxicity were noted only in parathion-treated rats. In general, chlorpyrifos increased eCB levels while parathion had no or lesser effects. Early changes in extracellular AEA, 2AG and PEA levels were significantly different between parathion and chlorpyrifos exposures. Differential changes in extracellular and/or tissue levels of eCBs and eCBLs could potentially influence a number of signaling pathways and contribute to selective neurological changes following acute OP intoxications.",Neurotoxicology,"['D000110', 'D000577', 'D000581', 'D000818', 'D001095', 'D004390', 'D002800', 'D003342', 'D063388', 'D004983', 'D005989', 'D050356', 'D008297', 'D008994', 'D009829', 'D010169', 'D010278', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D053719', 'D013997']","['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Amides', 'Amidohydrolases', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Corpus Striatum', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Ethanolamines', 'Glycerides', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Male', 'Monoacylglycerol Lipases', 'Oleic Acids', 'Palmitic Acids', 'Parathion', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Time Factors']",Comparative effects of parathion and chlorpyrifos on endocannabinoid and endocannabinoid-like lipid metabolites in rat striatum.,"['Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000494', None, None, None, None]","['metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26215119,2016
26156033,"Peanut represents one of the most harmful allergenic foods capable of triggering severe and sometimes lethal reactions in allergic consumers upon ingestion of even small amounts. Several proteins capable of inducing allergic reactions that have been recognised by patients' IgE antibodies have been identified from this nut source. Methods mainly based on ELISA assays have been developed in order to detect peanuts in several food commodities. In addition LC-MS/MS methods based on different mass analysers have also been devised for tracing peanut contamination in different foods achieving low limits of detection. The applicability of a benchtop high-resolution Exactive™ mass spectrometer has never been investigated for the rapid screening of peanut contamination in complex food matrices like mixtures of nuts. We report in this paper the design of suitable peanut markers and the development of an high-resolution Orbitrap™ mass spectrometer-based method for peanut detection in a mixture of nuts species. With this aim, different types of samples were prepared: (1) nuts-based powder made up of a mixture of hazelnuts, pistachios, almonds and walnuts; and (2) nuts powder fortified with peanuts. Different levels of fortifications were produced and the applicability of the method was tested. Finally, a subset of six peptides fulfilling specific analytical requirements was chosen to check the suitability of the method tailored to the detection of peanuts in nuts-based products, and two of them, peptides VYD and WLG, were selected as quantitative markers. The method proved to be a suitable screening tool to assess the presence of traces of peanuts in other tree nuts with a limit of detection as low as 4 µg of peanuts proteins or 26 µg of peanuts in 1 g of matrix.","Food additives & contaminants.

In the present work, we describe the PESI mass spectra obtained by in situ measurement of soybeans and several nuts (peanuts, walnuts, cashew nuts, macadamia nuts and almonds) using different solid needles as sampling probes. It was found that PESI-MS is a valuable approach for in situ lipid analysis of these seeds. The phospholipid and triacylglycerol PESI spectra of different nuts and soybean were compared by principal component analysis (PCA). PCA shows significant differences among the data of each family of seeds. Methanolic extracts of nuts and soybean were exposed to air and sunlight for several days. PESI mass spectra were recorded before and after the treatment. Along the aging of the oil (rancidification), the formation of oxidated species with variable number of hydroperoxide groups could be observed in the PESI spectra. The relative intensity of oxidated triacylglycerols signals increased with days of exposition. Monitoring sensitivity of PESI-MS was high.

26070817,"In this investigation, off-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry using a single column has been applied for the identification and quantification of triacylglycerols in edible oils. A novel mixed-mode phenyl-hexyl chromatographic column was employed in this off-line two-dimensional separation system. The phenyl-hexyl column combined the features of traditional C18 and silver-ion columns, which could provide hydrophobic interactions with triacylglycerols under acetonitrile conditions and can offer π-π interactions with triacylglycerols under methanol conditions. When compared with traditional off-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography employing two different chromatographic columns (C18 and silver-ion column) and using elution solvents comprised of two phases (reversed-phase/normal-phase) for triacylglycerols separation, the novel off-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography using a single column can be achieved by simply altering the mobile phase between acetonitrile and methanol, which exhibited a much higher selectivity for the separation of triacylglycerols with great efficiency and rapid speed. In addition, an approach based on the use of response factor with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry has been developed for triacylglycerols quantification. Due to the differences between saturated and unsaturated acyl chains, the use of response factors significantly improves the quantitation of triacylglycerols. This two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system was successfully applied for the profiling of triacylglycerols in soybean oils, peanut oils and lord oils. A total of 68 triacylglycerols including 40 triacylglycerols in soybean oils, 50 triacylglycerols in peanut oils and 44 triacylglycerols in lord oils have been identified and quantified. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data were analyzed using principal component analysis. The results of the principal component analysis enabled a clear identification of different plant oils.

26066859,"Cooking fumes are an important indoor source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Because indoor pollution has a more substantial impact on human health than outdoor pollution, PAHs from cooking fumes have drawn considerable attention. In this study, 16 PAHs emitted through deep-frying and frying methods using rapeseed, soybean, peanut, and olive oil were examined under a laboratory fume hood. Controlled experiments were conducted to collect gas- and particulate-phase PAHs emitted from the cooking oil fumes, and PAH concentrations were quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results show that deep-frying methods generate more PAHs and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) (1.3 and 10.9 times, respectively) because they consume greater volumes of edible oil and involve higher oil temperatures relative to those of frying methods. In addition, the total B[a]Peq concentration of deep-frying is 2.2-fold larger than that of frying. Regarding the four types of edible oils studied, rapeseed oil produced more PAH emission than the other three oil varieties. For all of the cooking tests, three- and four-ringed PAHs were the main PAH components regardless of the food and oil used. Concerning the PAH partition between gas and particulate phase, the gaseous compounds accounted for 59-96 % of the total. Meanwhile, the particulate fraction was richer of high molecular weight PAHs (five-six rings). Deep-frying and frying were confirmed as important sources of PAH pollution in internal environments.

Chromatographic time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay offered a magnified positive signal and low signal-to-noise ratio in time-resolved mode due to the absence of noise interference caused by excitation light sources.

This study aimed to establish whether albumin was a contaminant in those studies or actually present in the tubular cells, and if so, identify the albumin containing cells and commence exploration of the origin of the intracellular albumin. In addition to the expected proximal tubular albumin immunoreactivity, albumin was localized to mouse renal type-A intercalated cells and cells in the interstitium by three anti-albumin antibodies. Albumin did not colocalize with markers for early endosomes (EEA1), late endosomes/lysosomes (cathepsin D) or recycling endosomes (Rab11). Immuno-gold electron microscopy confirmed the presence of albumin-containing large spherical membrane associated bodies in the basal parts of intercalated cells. Message for albumin was detected in mouse renal cortex as well as in a wide variety of other tissues by RT-PCR, but was absent from isolated connecting tubules and cortical collecting ducts. Wild type I MDCK cells showed robust uptake of fluorescein-albumin from the basolateral side but not from the apical side when grown on permeable support. Only a subset of cells with low peanut agglutinin binding took up albumin. Albumin-aldosterone conjugates were also internalized from the basolateral side by MDCK cells. Aldosterone administration for 24 and 48 hours decreased albumin abundance in connecting tubules and cortical collecting ducts from mouse kidneys. We suggest that albumin is produced within the renal interstitium and taken up from the basolateral side by type-A intercalated cells by clathrin and dynamin independent pathways and speculate that the protein might act as a carrier of less water-soluble substances across the renal interstitium from the capillaries to the tubular cells.

25818139,"A novel method for the UHPLC-MS/MS analysis of (E)-4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is described. The method is based on derivatization of 4-HNE with pentafluorophenylhydrazine (1) or 4-trifluoromethylphenylhydrazine (2) in acetonitrile in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as catalyst at room temperature and allows complete analysis of one sample of vegetable oil in only 21 min, including sample preparation and chromatography. The method involving hydrazine 1, implemented in an ion trap instrument with analysis of the transition m/z 337→154 showed LOD=10.9 nM, average accuracy of 101% and precision ranging 2.5-4.0% RSD intra-day (2.7-4.1% RSD inter-day), with 4-HNE standard solutions. Average recovery from lipid matrices was 96.3% from vaseline oil, 91.3% from sweet almond oil and 105.3% from olive oil.

25814275,"To help safeguard the food supply and detect the presence of undeclared food allergens and gluten, most producers and regulatory agencies rely on commercial test kits. Most of these are ELISAs with a few being PCR-based. These methods are very sensitive and analyte specific, requiring different assays to detect each of the different food allergens. Mass spectrometry offers an alternative approach whereby multiple allergens may be detected simultaneously. However, mass spectrometry requires expensive equipment, highly trained analysts, and several years before a quantitative approach can be achieved. Using multianalyte profiling (xMAP®) technology, a commercial multiplex test kit based on the use of established antibodies was developed for the simultaneous detection of up to 14 different food allergens plus gluten. The assay simultaneously detects crustacean seafood, egg, gluten, milk, peanut, soy, and nine tree nuts (almond, Brazil nut, cashew, coconut, hazelnut, macadamia, pine nut, pistachio, and walnut). By simultaneously performing multiple tests (typically two) for each analyte, this magnetic bead-based assay offers built-in confirmatory analyses without the need for additional resources. Twenty-five of the assays were performed on buffer extracted samples, while five were conducted on samples extracted using reduced-denatured conditions. Thus, complete analysis for all 14 allergens and gluten requires only two wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. This makes it possible to include in a single analytical run up to 48 samples. All 30 bead sets in this multiplex assay detected 5 ng/mL of food allergen and gluten with responses greater than background. In addition, 26 of the bead sets displayed signal/noise ratios of five or greater. The bead-based design makes this 30-plex assay expandable to incorporate new antibodies and capture/detector methodologies by ascribing these new detectors to any of the unassigned bead sets that are commercially available.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000485', 'D028527', 'D004797', 'D005504', 'D005512', 'D005983', 'D007118', 'D059346']","['Allergens', 'Cuminum', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Glutens', 'Immunoassay', 'Magnets']",Multiplex detection of food allergens and gluten.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25814275,2016

The type of sorbents in dispersive-SPE (d-SPE) was optimized for the above matrices. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which mixed other materials like PSA (Primary Secondary Amines), GCB (Graphitized Carbon Black) and C18 (Octadecyl-silica), showed brilliant cleanup performance in multi residue monitoring (MRM) pesticide residue analysis. Cleanup effects with d-SPE and m-PFC methods were examined. When spiked at 3 concentration levels of 10, 100, 500 μg/kg in above matrices, for both d-SPE and m-PFC methods, the recoveries ranged from 70 to 110% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20%. Limits of quantification (LOQs) for both cleanup methods ranged from 1 to 25 μg/kg. Matrix-matched calibrations were performed with the coefficients of determination more than 0.99 between concentration levels of 10-1000 μg/kg. It was found that m-PFC was more convenient and effective than d-SPE with the same sorbents, due to the increased contact time and contact area between the extracts and compressed sorbents.

25285504,"Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi that may contaminate food and pose a health risk, especially in developing countries, where there is a lack of food security and quality is subsumed by food insufficiency. Aflatoxins are the most toxic known mycotoxins and are a significant risk factor for liver and kidney cancer, teratogenicity, undernutrition, and micronutrient malabsorption in both humans and animals. The main aim of the study was to determine the extent of fungal and aflatoxin contamination in peanuts and peanut butter being sold in both the formal and informal markets in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Eighteen peanut samples and 11 peanut butter samples were purchased from retail shops and the informal market. Fungal contamination was determined using standard mycology culture methods, while aflatoxin contamination was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection. Four of the six peanut samples tested for fungal contamination were infected with Aspergillus flavus/parasiticus, ranging from 3 to 20% of the kernels examined, while 27% (3 of 11) of the peanut butter samples were infected with A. flavus/parasiticus. Ninety-one percent (10 of 11) of the peanut butter samples were contaminated with aflatoxins (mean, 75.66 ng/g, and range, 6.1 to 247 ng/g), and aflatoxin B1 was the most prevalent (mean, 51.0 ng/g, and range, 3.7 to 191 ng/g).

25157831,"The rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode associated Bacillus cereus and the antifungal compounds produced by this bacterium were evaluated for their activity in reducing postharvest decay of peanut kernels caused by Aspergillus species in in vitro and in vivo tests. The results showed that B. cereus had a significant effect on biocontrol effectiveness in in vitro and in vivo conditions. The antifungal compounds produced by the B. cereus were purified using silica gel column chromatography and their structure was elucidated using extensive spectral analyses. The compounds were identified as diketopiperazines (DKPs) [cyclo-(L-Pro-Gly), cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Tyr), cyclo-(L-Phe-Gly) and cyclo(4-hydroxy-L-Pro-L-Trp)]. The antifungal activities of diketopiperazines were studied against five Aspergillus species and best MIC of 2 µg/ml was recorded against A. flavus by cyclo(4-hydroxy-L-Pro-L-Trp). To investigate the potential application of cyclo(4-hydroxy-L-Pro-L-Trp) to eliminate fungal spoilage in food and feed, peanut kernels was used as a food model system. White mycelia and dark/pale green spores of Aspergillus species were observed in the control peanut kernels after 2 days incubation. However the fungal growth was not observed in peanut kernels treated with cyclo(4-hydroxy-L-Pro-L-Trp). The cyclo(4-hydroxy-L-Pro-L-Trp) was nontoxic to two normal cell lines [fore skin (FS) normal fibroblast and African green monkey kidney (VERO)] up to 200 µg/ml in MTT assay. Thus the cyclo(4-hydroxy-L-Pro-L-Trp) identified in this study may be a promising alternative to chemical preservatives as a potential biopreservative agent which prevent fungal growth in food and feed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that the entomopathogenic nematode associated B. cereus and cyclo(4-hydroxy-L-Pro-L-Trp) could be used as a biocontrol agents against postharvest fungal disease caused by Aspergillus species.

Roasted peanut color, odor activity values (OAVs), descriptive sensory panel analysis, free fatty acid, and peroxide values were determined. Color and OAVs were also analyzed on 2 commercial peanut butters. OAVs were calculated using volatile levels quantified with selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry and known odor thresholds. All treatments resulted in a minimum of 3 log reduction of inoculated bacterial population. Resistance to the process was not influenced by storage of inoculated peanuts prior to treatment. Roasting by different methods produced equivalent, commercially ideal L* color. Based on the OAVs, treatments had similar volatiles important to flavor compared to the commercial samples. Descriptive sensory analysis showed no significant difference between the roasting treatments for most of the sensory attributes. Lipid oxidation was not significantly different between the roasting methods, displaying no evidence that roasting time or temperature affected lipid oxidation, when ideal color was produced.

A comprehensive understanding of seed metabolism and the effects of water-deficit stress on the incorporation of the main storage reserves in seeds, such as proteins, fatty acids, starch, and secondary metabolites, will enhance our ability to improve seed quality and yield through molecular breeding programs. In the present study, we employed a label-free quantitative proteomics approach to study the functional proteins altered in the midmature (65-70 days postanthesis) peanut seed grown under water-deficit stress conditions. We created a pod-specific proteome database and identified 93 nonredundant, statistically significant, and differentially expressed proteins between well-watered and drought-stressed seeds. Mapping of these differential proteins revealed three candidate biological pathways (glycolysis, sucrose and starch metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism) that were significantly altered due to water-deficit stress. Differential accumulation of proteins from these pathways provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed physiological changes, which include reductions in pod yield and biomass, reduced germination, reduced vigor, decreased seed membrane integrity, increase in storage proteins, and decreased total fatty acid content. Some of the proteins encoding rate limiting enzymes of biosynthetic pathways could be utilized by breeders to improve peanut seed production during water-deficit conditions in the field.

Lotus japonicus (Lotus) is an established legume plant model system for studies of symbiotic and pathogenic microbial interactions and, due to its well characterized genotype/phenotype and easily manipulated genome, may also be suitable for studies of legume food allergy. Here we present a comprehensive study of the Lotus N-glycoproteome. The global and site-specific N-glycan structures of Lotus seed globulins were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based glycomics and glycoproteomics techniques. In total, 19 N-glycan structures comprising high mannose (∼20%), pauci-mannosidic (∼40%), and complex forms (∼40%) were determined. The pauci-mannosidic and complex N-glycans contained high amounts of the typical plant determinants β-1,2-xylose and α-1,3-fucose. Two abundant Lotus seed N-glycoproteins were site-specifically profiled; a predicted lectin containing two fully occupied N-glycosylation sites carried predominantly pauci-mannosidic structures in different distributions. In contrast, Lotus convicilin storage protein 2 (LCP2) carried exclusively high mannose N-glycans similar to its homologue, Ara h 1, which is the major allergen in peanut. In silico investigation confirmed that peanut Ara h 1 and Lotus LCP2 are highly similar at the primary and higher protein structure levels. Hence, we suggest that Lotus has the potential to serve as a model system for studying the role of seed proteins and their glycosylation in food allergy.

In vitro assays, GAE showed remarkable antioxidant activity to scavenge free radicals (ABTS, DPPH, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals), inhibit lipid peroxidation and show reducing power. In food system, GAE exhibited the obvious capacity to inhibit the oxidation of peanut oil and lard, which may be attributed to its high content of phenolic compounds. Moreover, GAE could effectively protect Caco-2 cell against H2O2-induced oxidative injury. With the isolation and purification by chromatography, quercetin was identified as the main antioxidant component of GAE, which was capable of scavenging ABTS, DPPH, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. These results suggest that G. affine is a potential source for preparing functional foods and nutraceuticals in food industry.

23675783,"Rice, the staple food of south and east Asian counties, is considered to be hypoallergenic. However, several clinical studies have documented rice-induced allergy in sensitive patients. Rice proteins with molecular weights of 14-16, 26, 33, and 56 kDa have been identified as allergens. Recently, it was documented that the 56 kDa rice allergen was responsible for rice-induced anaphylaxis. The 14-16 kDa allergens have been identified as α-amylase inhibitors; the 26 kDa protein has been identified as α-globulin; and the 33 kDa protein has been identified as glyoxalase I. However, the identity of the 56 kDa rice allergen has not yet been determined. In this study, we demonstrate that serum from patients allergic to maize shows IgE binding to a 56 kDa protein that was present in both maize and rice but not in the oil seeds soybean and peanut. The 56 kDa IgE-binding protein was abundant in the rice endosperm. We have purified this protein from rice endosperm and demonstrated its reactivity to IgE antibodies from the serum of maize-allergic patients. The purified protein was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, resulting in identification of this rice allergen as granule-bound starch synthase, a product of the Waxy gene. Immunoblot analysis using protein extracts from a waxy mutant of rice revealed the absence of the 56 kDa IgE-binding protein. Our results demonstrate that the 56 kDa rice allergen is granule-bound starch synthase and raise the possibility of using waxy mutants of rice as a potential source of the hypoallergenic diet for patients sensitized to the 56 kDa rice allergen.

Test portions of homogenized grain or nut products were extracted with acetonitrile/water (85:15, v/v), followed by high-speed centrifugation and dilution with water. Mean recoveries (± standard deviations) were 84 ± 6, 89 ± 6, 97 ± 9, 87 ± 12, 104 ± 16, and 92 ± 18% from corn, rice, wheat, almond, peanut, and pistachio products, respectively, and the matrix-dependent instrument quantitation limits ranged from 0.2 to 12.8 μg/kg, depending on the mycotoxin. Matrix effects, as measured by the slope ratios of matrix-matched and solvent-only calibration curves, revealed primarily suppression and were more pronounced in nuts than in grains. The measured mycotoxin concentrations in 11 corn and wheat reference materials were not different from the certified concentrations. Nineteen mycotoxins were identified and measured in 35 of 70 commercial grain and nut products, ranging from 0.3 ± 0.1 μg/kg (aflatoxin B1 in peanuts) to 1143 ± 87 μg/kg (fumonisin B1 in corn flour).

The method includes all mycotoxins regulated in the European Union and mycotoxins regularly found in food. After extraction with an acidified acetonitrile water mixture, the raw extract was diluted and injected directly into the UHPLC-MS/MS system. In two chromatographic runs, analysis was performed in positive and in negative ionisation mode. The method was in-house validated for the most important 65 analytes in these four commodities. Apparent recoveries between 80 and 120% were obtained for about half of the analyte-matrix combinations. Good repeatabilities (standard deviations < 10%) were achieved for the vast majority (83%) of all cases. Only in 6% of all combinations did the standard deviations exceed 15%. Matrix effects, arising during electrospray ionisation, significantly influenced the determination. For instance, signal suppression was observed for several early-eluting analytes and also signal enhancement up to 295% for physcion in peanuts was determined. Concerning extraction recovery, 94% of the analyte-matrix combinations showed values higher than 50%. Lower limits of quantification ranged between 0.04 μg kg(-1) for enniatin B3 in peanuts and 500 μg kg(-1) for HC toxin in hazelnuts. Additionally, the applicability of the developed method was demonstrated through the analysis of 53 naturally contaminated nut samples from Austria and Turkey.

Structure alignment revealed that Ara h 5 is more similar to Bet v 2 than to Hev b 8, although sequence alignment suggested that Ara h 5 is more closely related to Hev b 8 than to Bet v 2, indicating that homology-model-based prediction of immunoglobulin E epitopes needs to be interpreted with caution.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000485', 'D052179', 'D010367', 'D002852', 'D006023', 'D015394', 'D010940', 'D051304', 'D017433']","['Allergens', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Arachis', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Glycoproteins', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plant Proteins', 'Profilins', 'Protein Structure, Secondary']",Crystal structure of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) allergen Ara h 5.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23350842,2014
23305769,"Mold spoilage is the main cause of substantial economic loss in cereals and might also cause public health problems due to the production of mycotoxins. The aim of this study was to separate and purify and to identify antifungal compounds of bacterium associated with novel entomopathogenic nematode and check the antifungal property of identified compound in particular food model systems. The antifungal compound was purified using silica gel column chromatography, TLC and HPLC and its structure was elucidated using NMR (¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, ¹H-¹H COSY, ¹H-¹³C HMBC), HRMS and Marfey's method. Based on the spectral data, the active compounds were identified as diketopiperazine [cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu)]. The antifungal activity of cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) was studied by MIC and paper disk assay against Aspergillus flavus MTCC 277 and Aspergillus niger MTCC 282 and best MIC value of 8μg/ml was recorded against A. flavus. Cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) strongly inhibit mycelia growth of fungus and thereby affecting aflatoxin production. To investigate the potential application of the cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) and to eliminate fungal spoilage in food and feed, soybean and peanut were used as models. White mycelia and dark/pale green spores of A. flavus were observed in the control soybeans after 2-day incubation. However the fungal growth was not observed in soybeans treated with cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu). Almost the same result was observed for peanuts treated with cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) for A. niger. The cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) was nontoxic to two normal human cell lines (FS normal fibroblast and L231 lung epithelial) up to 200μg/ml. Thus the diketopiperazine derivative identified in the study may be a promising alternative to chemical preservatives as a potential biopreservative which prevent fungal growth and mycotoxin formation in food and feed.",Microbiological research,"['D000818', 'D000935', 'D010367', 'D001231', 'D001234', 'D001409', 'D002460', 'D002851', 'D002853', 'D002855', 'D054659', 'D002523', 'D006801', 'D009682', 'D008826', 'D025282', 'D009348', 'D013025']","['Animals', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Arachis', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'Aspergillus niger', 'Bacillus cereus', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Diketopiperazines', 'Edible Grain', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Mycelium', 'Nematoda', 'Soybeans']","Purification of an antifungal compound, cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) for cereals produced by Bacillus cereus subsp. thuringiensis associated with entomopathogenic nematode.","[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000382', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000382', None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000382', 'Q000382']","[None, 'chemistry', 'microbiology', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'microbiology', None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'microbiology', 'microbiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23305769,2013

Some of these pharmaceutical excipients are produced from allergenic foods (e.g., milk, egg, peanut, soybean, and sesame) and removing proteins completely from such excipients is difficult. Therefore, if individuals with food allergy consume drugs containing allergenic food-derived excipients, eliminating the risk of developing specific allergic symptoms induced by them may not be possible. We determined the levels of proteins in pharmaceutical excipients and ethical drugs (inhalants and injections) by spectrophotometric analyses.

Despite the severity of allergic reactions and growing prevalence in children and adults, there is no cure for peanut allergy, leaving avoidance as the primary mode of treatment. To improve analytical methods for peanut allergen detection, researchers must overcome obstacles involved in handling complex food matrices while attempting to decipher the chemistry that underlies allergen protein interactions. To address such challenges, we conducted a global proteome characterization of raw peanuts using a sophisticated GELFrEE-PAGE-LC-MS/MS platform consisting of gel-based protein fractionation followed by mass spectrometric identification. The in-solution mass-selective protein fractionation: (1) enhances the number of unique peptide identifications, (2) provides a visual map of protein isoforms, and (3) aids in the identification of disulfide-linked protein complexes. GELFrEE-PAGE-LC-MS/MS not only overcomes many of the challenges involved in the study of plant proteomics, but enriches the understanding of peanut protein chemistry, which is typically unattainable in a traditional bottom-up proteomic analysis.

The study presents a novel suspension array technology for quantifying four mycotoxins, namely, aflatoxin B1, deoxynivalenol, T-2 toxin, and zearalenone, in corn and peanut. Using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride, the complete antigens of the mycotoxins became attached to the microspheres with viable activity. The optimal concentrations of each antibody and biotin-rabbit anti-goat IgG were obtained through chessboard titration. The four mycotoxins were detected simultaneously and quantitatively in corn and peanut using indirect competitive immunoassay. Multi-channel standard curves with appropriate logistic correlation (R(2)>0.9819) were respectively plotted. The broad working ranges with three to four orders of magnitude were calculated, and limits of detection at the pg level were found to be better than those obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography. The recovery rates in the actual samples generally ranged from 80.16% to 117.65%, with an intra-assay coefficient of variation lower than 15%, which indicated high accuracy and repeatability.

22969785,"Soybean (Glycinemax) is a hugely valuable soft commodity that generates tens of billions of dollars annually. This value is due in part to the balanced composition of the seed which is roughly 1:2:2 oil, starch, and protein by weight. In turn, the seeds have many uses with various derivatives appearing broadly in processed food products. As is true with many edible seeds, soybeans contain proteins that are anti-nutritional factors and allergens. Soybean, along with milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and wheat, elicit a majority of food allergy reactions in the United States. Soybean seed composition can be affected by breeding, and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture, insect/pathogen load, and/or soil nutrient levels). The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of genotype and environment on allergen and anti-nutritional proteins in soybean. To address genetic and environmental effects, four varieties of non-GM soybeans were grown in six geographically distinct regions of North America (Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Ontario, and Pennsylvania). Absolute quantification of proteins by mass spectrometry can be achieved with a technique called multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), during which signals from an endogenous protein are compared to those from a synthetic heavy-labeled internal standard. Using MRM, eight allergens were absolutely quantified for each variety in each environment. Statistical analyses show that for most allergens, the effects of environment far outweigh the differences between varieties brought about by breeding.",Frontiers in plant science,[],[],Environmental effects on allergen levels in commercially grown non-genetically modified soybeans: assessing variation across north america.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22969785,2012
22948807,"Food allergy has become a major public health concern in westernized countries, and allergic reactions to peanuts are particularly common and severe. Allergens are defined as antigens that elicit an IgE response, and most allergenic materials (e.g., pollens, danders, and foods) contain multiple allergenic proteins. This has led to the concept that there are ""major"" allergens and allergens of less importance. ""Major allergens"" have been defined as allergens that bind a large amount of IgE from the majority of patients and have biologic activity. However, the ability of an allergen to cross-link complexes of IgE and its high-affinity receptor FcεRI (IgE/FcεRI), which we have termed its allergic effector activity, does not correlate well with assays of IgE binding. To identify the proteins that are the most active allergens in peanuts, we and others have employed in vitro model assays of allergen-mediated cross-linking of IgE/FcεRI complexes and have demonstrated that the most potent allergens are not necessarily those that bind the most IgE. The importance of a specific allergen can be determined by measuring the allergic effector activity of that allergen following purification under non-denaturing conditions and by specifically removing the allergen from a complex allergenic extract either by chromatography or by specific immunodepletion. In our studies of peanut allergens, our laboratory has found that two related allergens, Ara h 2 and Ara h 6, together account for the majority of the effector activity in a crude peanut extract. Furthermore, murine studies demonstrated that Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 are not only the major elicitors of anaphylaxis in this system, but also can effectively desensitize peanut-allergic mice. As a result of these observations, we propose that the definition of a major allergen should be based on the potency of that allergen in assays of allergic effector activity and demonstration that removal of that allergen from an extract results in loss of potency. Using these criteria, Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 are the major peanut allergens.",Immunologic research,"['D000485', 'D000818', 'D052179', 'D010367', 'D006801', 'D007073', 'D021183']","['Allergens', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Arachis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Peanut Hypersensitivity']",Redefining the major peanut allergens.,"['Q000276', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000276', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000276']","['immunology', None, 'immunology', 'immunology', None, 'immunology', 'immunology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22948807,2013

22506710,"The conversion of two agricultural wastes, sugar beet pulp and peanut hulls, into sustainable activated carbons is presented and their potential application for the treatment of arsenate solution is investigated. A direct and physical activation is selected as well as a simple chemical treatment of the adsorbents. The material properties, such as BET surface areas, porous volumes, elemental analysis, ash contents and pH(PZC), of these alternative carbonaceous porous materials are determined and compared with a commercial granular activated carbon. An adsorption study based on experimental kinetic and equilibrium data is conducted in a batch reactor and completed by the use of different models (intraparticle diffusion, pseudo-second-order, Langmuir and Freundlich) and by isotherms carried out in natural waters. It is thus demonstrated that sugar beet pulp and peanut hulls are good precursors to obtain activated carbons for arsenate removal.","Journal of environmental science and health.

22475946,"Aflatoxins are among the most toxic mycotoxins. Early detection and quantification of aflatoxin-producing species is crucial to improve food safety. In the present work, two protocols of real-time PCR (qPCR) based on SYBR Green and TaqMan were developed, and their sensitivity and specificity were evaluated. Primers and probes were designed from the o-methyltransferase gene (omt-1) involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis. Fifty-three mold strains representing aflatoxin producers and non-producers of different species, usually reported in food products, were used as references. All strains were tested for aflatoxins production by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The functionality of the proposed qPCR method was demonstrated by the strong linear relationship of the standard curves constructed with the omt-1 gene copy number and Ct values for the different aflatoxin producers tested. The ability of the qPCR protocols to quantify aflatoxin-producing molds was evaluated in different artificially inoculated foods. A good linear correlation was obtained over the range 4 to 1 log cfu/g per reaction for all qPCR assays in the different food matrices (peanuts, spices and dry-fermented sausages). The detection limit in all inoculated foods ranged from 1 to 2 log cfu/g for SYBR Green and TaqMan assays. No significant effect was observed due to the different equipment, operator, and qPCR methodology used in the tests of repeatability and reproducibility for different foods. The proposed methods quantified with high efficiency the fungal load in foods.

Consumption data for the selected foodstuffs were collected by means of a food-frequency questionnaire. The studied population was grouped by age in infants, children, adolescents and adults; and exposure to OTA through the specified foodstuffs, and through wine and coffee, was assessed. Exposure assessment was done through deterministic and probabilistic modelling of the contamination and consumption data. OTA occurrence and mean of positive samples (ng g(-1) or ng ml(-1), for beer) were the following: 8.7% and 0.233 in baby foods; 88.7% and 0.022 in beer; 2.8% and 0.728 in corn-based breakfast cereals; 25% and 0.293 in wheat-based breakfast cereals; 12.9% and 0.283 in loaf bread; 41.7% and 0.241 in peanuts; and 2.9% and 0.228 in pistachios.

The applicability of these assay formats was demonstrated by evaluating the performance characteristics of both tests through performing multiple experiments on different days. Both assays were further evaluated by analyzing naturally contaminated samples in the laboratory and also in the field under tropical conditions (Cameroon, West Africa).

The present study was aimed to isolate and characterize a major allergenic protein from blackgram (Phaseolus mungo). Respiratory allergy patients with history of blackgram allergy were skin prick tested (SPT) and sera were collected from SPT positive patients. The blackgram extract was fractionated using a combination of anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The purified protein was characterized by indirect ELISA, immunoblot, ELISA inhibition, SPTs, stripped basophil histamine release, lymphoproliferation assay and digestibility assay. The purified protein separated at 28 kDa on 12% gel and showed IgE binding with 81% of blackgram hypersensitive patients' sera on immunoblot indicating it to be a major allergen. Periodic Acid Schiff's and meta-periodate treatment staining detected it to be a glycoprotein. The 28 kDa protein recognized 7/9 (77.8%) of blackgram positive patients by SPT, where as all 9 patients showed significant histamine release on stimulation with protein as compared to controls. The 28 kDa protein remained stable up to 15 min on incubation with SGF. Bands of 14-16 kDa appeared after 15 min of pepsin digestion that remained stable up to 60 min of incubation. However, purified protein degraded within 5 min after incubation with SIF. The N-terminus-12 residues sequence of 28 kDa protein was GRREDDYDNLQL. A stretch of residues 'DDYDNLQL' showed homology with Rho-specific inhibitor of transcription termination (E=0.42, Identity=87%) and NBS-LRR type disease resistant protein from peanut (Arachis hypogaea) (E=2, Identity=77%).

The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for peak integration were assessed both statistically and empirically respectively. 2-Pentyl furan was detected from 10 of 45 food stuffs tested. Levels were highest from soymilk (3 of 3 brands), lower from pumpkin, peanuts, rolled oats 2, Ensure Plus, tinned asparagus, tinned beans and a vegetable exact (Marmite). No 2-PF was detectable in anti-fungal medications used to treat IA or commonly used cosmetics tested. There was no difference in 2-PF breath levels between morning and afternoon or fasting and non fasting samples taken from healthy subjects eating a diet without 2-PF rich foods. 2-Pentyl furan levels were present in breath samples immediately after a mouth rinse with soy milk (P<0.001), and in some subjects after ingesting soy milk and rinsing their mouth with water. The breath test for 2-PF can be conducted without an overnight fast or at a specified time provided the mouth has been rinsed 30 min or more from when 2-PF containing products have been ingested.","Journal of chromatography.

The method was based on our earlier published LC-MS(2)-based method in a research frame aimed at the identification and determination of hidden allergens in foods by using selective biomarker peptides. A C18 particle-packed column and a silica-based C18 monolithic column were compared in terms of chromatographic performances, such as peak shape, resolution, analysis time and selectivity. The C18 particle-packed column exhibited better performances and was further used for method development and validation. By operating under MS(2) selected reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition mode, linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation, trueness and precision were evaluated on breakfast samples enriched with a mix of the five nuts. Good linearity of the matrix matched-calibration curves was obtained and detection limit values generally varied from 14 to 55 mg nut/kg matrix.

Does this evolution reflect improvements due to the introduction of standardised methods? Is there an improvement in performance parameters such as repeatability, reproducibility and measurement uncertainty? To answer these questions, data from six interlaboratory studies, performed in the last 20 years for the certification of aflatoxins in peanut meal, peanut butter and animal feed, have been re-evaluated.

20345176,"Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is one of the most important sources of plant protein. Current selection of genotypes requires molecular characterization of available populations. Peanut genome database has several EST cDNAs which can be used to analyze gene expression. Analysis of proteins is a direct approach to define function of their associated genes. Proteome analysis linked to genome sequence information is critical for functional genomics. However, the available protein expression data is extremely inadequate. Proteome analysis of peanut leaf was conducted using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with sequence identification using MALDI/TOF to determine their identity and function related to growth, development and responses to stresses. Peanut leaf proteins were resolved into 300 polypeptides with pI values between 3.5 and 8.0 and relative molecular masses from 12 to 100 kDa. A master leaf polypeptide profile was generated based on the consistently expressed protein pattern. Proteins present in 205 spots were identified using GPS software and Viridiplantae database (NCBI). Identity of some of these proteins included RuBisCO, glutamine synthetase, glyoxisomal malate dehydrogenase, oxygen evolving enhancer protein and tubulin. Bioinformatical analyses showed that there are 133 unique protein identities. They were categorized into 10 and 8 groups according to their cellular compartmentalization and biological functionality, respectively. Enzymes necessary for carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis dominated in the set of identified proteins. The reference map derived from a drought-tolerant cv.Vemana should serve as the basis for further investigations of peanut physiology such as detection of expressed changes due to biotic and abiotic stresses, plant development. Furthermore, the leaf proteome map will lead to development of protein markers for cultivar identification at seedling stage of the plant.

Fresh and cooked green beans were tested by a prick + prick technique. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and IgE immunoblotting were performed with boiled vegetable extract, and the N-terminal sequence of the immunoreactive protein was obtained by analyzing the excised band in a protein sequencer. Immunoblotting inhibition of cooked green bean with in-house-purified peach lipid transfer protein (LTP) Pru p 3 was performed. An interesting green bean protein was chromatographically purified, tested with a pool serum, and inhibited with Pru p 3. Moreover, its molecular mass was determined by mass spectrometry. Prick + prick tests with raw and cooked green beans were positive for all of the patients. IgE immunoblotting showed that all of the patients reacted toward a unique IgE-binding protein at about 9 kDa. The obtained N-terminal sequence revealed the following amino acids: Ala-Ile-Ser-X-Gly-Qln-Val-Thr-Ser-Ser-Leu-Ala, corresponding to an LTP.

To this end, 240 samples of peanut products traded in the cities of Araras, Leme, Pirassununga and Porto Ferreira were collected from June 2006 to May 2007. The samples were analyzed for aflatoxins (AF) B(1), B(2), G(1) and G(2) by high performance liquid chromatography. Results showed 44.2% samples positive for AF at levels of 0.5 to 103.8 microg x kg(-1). Nine of the positive samples (3.7% of the analysed samples) had total aflatoxin concentrations (B(1)+B(2)+G(1)+G(2)) higher than the limit established by Brazilian regulations (20 microg x kg(-1)). Based on the above data, the probable mean daily intake (PDI(M)) of aflatoxins from peanut products in the Northeast region of São Paulo was estimated to be 0.23 ng kg b.w. day(-1). Although this PDI(M) value was relatively low, results indicate that aflatoxin contamination of peanut products may be a public health concern in Brazil, when considering the potential exposure of highly susceptible consumers. For example, it should be emphasized that children are potentially exposed to aflatoxins, since they consume large quantities of peanut candies, and these products had the highest number of samples positive for AFB(1).",International journal of molecular sciences,"['D000348', 'D010367', 'D001230', 'D001938', 'D005504']","['Aflatoxins', 'Arachis', 'Aspergillus', 'Brazil', 'Food Analysis']","Determination of aflatoxins in peanut products in the northeast region of São Paulo, Brazil.","['Q000032', 'Q000382', None, None, None]","['analysis', 'microbiology', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19333440,2014

Here, we present a practical comparison of gel-free and label-free methods, peak integration and spectral counting, using a linear trap mass spectrometer. The results show that both methods are linear and reproducible with protein standards from 5-200 ng, however, bioinformatic analysis for spectral counting is much simpler and therefore more amenable to high-throughput sample processing. We therefore applied spectral counting towards the analysis of transgenic peanut lines targeting the reduction of a prominent allergen.

The AP and tocopherol were mixed into a 10% (w/w) WPI solution containing 6.7% glycerol. Process 1 (P1) blended an AP and tocopherol mixture directly into the WPI solution using a high-speed homogenizer.

After peanuts were coated with WPI solutions, color changes of peanuts were measured during 16 wk of storage at 25 degrees C, and the oxidation of peanuts was determined by hexanal analysis using solid-phase micro-extraction samplers and GC-MS. Regardless of the presence of antioxidants in the coating layer, the formation of hexanal from the oxidation of peanut lipids was reduced by WPI coatings, which indicates WPI coatings protected the peanuts from oxygen permeation and oxidation.

In this study, the purified alcohol-soluble, non-reduced protein (prolamin) fraction from rice seed was investigated for the occurrence of O-linked oligosaccharides. As storage prolamins are unlikely to be O-glycosylated, any O-glycosylation found was likely to belong to co-extracted proteins, whether because of association with the protein body or solubility. SDS-PAGE and MS analyses revealed 14 and 16kDa protein families in fractions that bound to the lectins peanut agglutinin (PNA), Vicia villosa lectin (VVL) and Jacalin, indicative of the presence of O-linked saccharides. Enzymatic cleavage, fluorescent labeling and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis demonstrated a peak consistent with Gal-beta-(1-->3)-GalNAc, with similar MS/MS fragmentation. Additionally, upon chemical analysis, a GlcNAc-containing O-linked carbohydrate moiety was discovered. Protein blotting with anti-O-GlcNAc antibody (clone CTD110.6) was positive in a subpopulation of the 14kDa alcohol-soluble protein fraction, but a hot capping experiment was negative. Therefore, the GlcNAc residue in this case is unlikely to be terminal. Additionally, a positive reaction with CTD110.6mAb cannot be taken as absolute proof of O-GlcNAc modification and further confirmatory experiments should be employed. We hypothesize that O-glycosylation may contribute to protein functionality or regulation. Further investigation is required to identify the specific proteins with these modifications.

The composition of the plasticizers in the gaskets was analysed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) and phthalates were determined in the homogenized food samples. ESBO was the principal plasticizer in five of the gaskets; in 14 it was phthalates. ESBO was found in seven of the food samples at concentrations from 6 to 100 mg kg(-1). The highest levels (91-100 mg kg(-1)) were in oily foods such as garlic, chilli or olives in oil. Phthalates, i.e. di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP) and di-iso-nonylphthalates (DINP), were found in seven samples at 6-173 mg kg(-1). The highest concentrations (99-173 mg kg(-1)) were in products of garlic and tomatoes in oil and in fatty food products such as sauce béarnaise and peanut butter. For five of the samples the overall migration from unused lids to the official fatty food simulant olive oil was determined and compared with the legal limit of 60 mg kg(-1). The results ranged from 76 to 519 mg kg(-1) and as a consequence the products were withdrawn from the market.","Food additives & contaminants.

18348046,"Mycotoxin analysis is usually carried out by high performance liquid chromatography after immunoaffinity column cleanup or in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. These methods normally involve determination of single compounds only. EU legislation already exists for the aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and patulin in food, and legislation will come into force for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and the fumonisins in 2007. To enforce the various legal limits, it would be preferable to determine all mycotoxins by routine analysis in different types of matrices in one single extract. This would also be advantageous for HACCP control purposes. For this reason, a multi-method was developed with which 33 mycotoxins in various products could be analysed simultaneously. The mycotoxins were extracted with an acetonitrile/water mixture, diluted with water and then directly injected into a LC-MS/MS system. The mycotoxins were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and detected using an electrospray ionisation interface (ESI) and tandem MS, using MRM in the positive ion mode, to increase specificity for quality control. The following mycotoxins could be analysed in a single 30-min run: Aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, alpha-zearalenol, alpha-zearalanol, beta-zearalanol, sterigmatocystin, cyclopiazonic acid, penicillic acid, fumonisins B1, B2 and B3, diacetoxyscirpenol, 3- and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, zearalanone, ergotamin, ergocornin, ergocristin, alpha-ergocryptin, citrinin, roquefortin C, fusarenone X, nivalenol, mycophenolic acid, alternariol and alternariol monomethyl ether. The limit of quantification for the aflatoxins and ochratoxin A was 1.0 microg kg(-1) and for deoxynivalenol 50 microg kg(-1). The quantification limits for the other mycotoxins were in the range 10-200 microg kg(-1). The matrix effect and validation data are presented for between 13 and 24 mycotoxins in peanuts, pistachios, wheat, maize, cornflakes, raisins and figs. The method has been compared with the official EU method for the determination of aflatoxins in food and relevant FAPAS rounds. The multi-mycotoxin method has been proven by the detection of more than one mycotoxin in maize, buckwheat, figs and nuts. The LC-MS/MS technique has also been applied to baby food, which is subject to lower limits for aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A, ergot alkaloids in naturally contaminated rye and freeze-dried silage samples.","Food additives & contaminants.

18303822,"Aflatoxins are a group of very carcinogenic mycotoxins that can be found on a wide range of food commodities including nuts, cereals, and spices. In this study, the first LC-MS/MS stable isotope dilution assay (SIDA) for the determination of aflatoxins in foods was developed. The development of this method was enabled by easily accessible isotope-labeled (deuterated) aflatoxins B2 and G2, which were synthesized by catalytic deuteration of aflatoxin B1 and G1, purified, and well-characterized by NMR and MS. All four aflatoxins of interest (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were quantified in food samples by using these two labeled internal standards. The response factors (RF) of the linear calibrations were revealed to be matrix independent for labeled aflatoxin B2/aflatoxin B2 and labeled aflatoxin G2/aflatoxin G2. For labeled aflatoxin B 2/aflatoxin B 1 and labeled aflatoxin B2/aflatoxin G1 matrix-matched calibration was performed for the model matrices almonds and wheat flour, showing significant differences of the RFs. Limits of detection (LOD) were determined by applying a statistical approach in the presence of the two model matrices, yielding 0.31 microg/kg (aflatoxin B1), 0.09 microg/kg (aflatoxin B2), 0.38 microg/kg (aflatoxin G1), and 0.32 microg/kg (aflatoxin G2) for almonds (similar LODs were obtained for wheat flour). Recovery rates were between 90 and 105% for all analytes. Coefficients of variation (CV) of 12% (aflatoxin B1), 3.6% (aflatoxin B2), 14% (aflatoxin G1), and 4.8% (aflatoxin G2) were obtained from interassay studies. For further validation, a NIST standard reference food sample was analyzed for aflatoxins B1 and B2. The method was successfully applied to determine trace levels of aflatoxins in diverse food matrices such as peanuts, nuts, grains, and spices.

The LC/MS/MS method was based on the determination of four different peptide biomarkers selective for the Ara h2 and Ara h3/4 peanut proteins. The performance of this method was compared with that of a non-competitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method with ICP-MS detection of the metal used to tag the antibody for the quantitative peanut protein analysis in food. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantitation of the ICP-MS immunoassay were 2.2 and 5 microg peanuts g(-1) matrix, respectively, the recovery ranged from 86 +/- 18% to 110 +/- 4% and linearity was proved in the 5-50 microg g(-1) range. The LC/MS/MS method allowed us to obtain LODs of 1 and 5 microg protein g(-1) matrix for Ara h3/4 and Ara h2, respectively, thus obtaining significantly higher values with respect to the ELISA ICP-MS method, taking into account the different expression for concentrations. Linearity was established in the 10-200 microg g(-1) range of peanut proteins in the food matrix investigated and good precision (RSD <10%) was demonstrated. Both the two approaches, used for screening or confirmative purposes, showed the power of mass spectrometry when used as a very selective detector in difficult matrices even if some limitations still exist, i.e. matrix suppression in the LC/ESI-MS/MS procedure and the change of the Ag/Ab binding with matrix in the ICP-MS method.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D000485', 'D010367', 'D002099', 'D002851', 'D002523', 'D005504', 'D006358', 'D007118', 'D008670', 'D015203', 'D012680', 'D021241', 'D013194']","['Allergens', 'Arachis', 'Cacao', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Analysis', 'Hot Temperature', 'Immunoassay', 'Metals', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Staining and Labeling']",Determination of peanut allergens in cereal-chocolate-based snacks: metal-tag inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry immunoassay versus liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'methods', None, None, None, 'methods', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18278822,2008

One hundred four of the 694 samples were found to give positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) readings for AFB1 and were further investigated with high-performance liquid chromatography. Thirty-two samples, including 2 maize samples, 3 soybean products, 20 peanut samples, nut samples, and their products, and 7 spices, were found to be contaminated with AFB1 (4.6% incidence), up to 48.6 microg kg(-1). The level of AFB1 contamination in 28 of the 32 food products was below 10 microg kg(-1), which is the legal tolerance limit in Korea. From data on daily food consumption, the exposure dose of AFB1 was estimated to be 6.42 x 10(-7) mg kg(-1) body weight (bw) day(-1).

17899033,"A liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS-MS) method based on the detection of biomarker peptides from allergenic proteins was devised for confirming and quantifying peanut allergens in foods. Peptides obtained from tryptic digestion of Ara h 2 and Ara h 3/4 proteins were identified and characterized by LC-MS and LC-MS-MS with a quadrupole-time of flight mass analyzer. Four peptides were chosen and investigated as biomarkers taking into account their selectivity, the absence of missed cleavages, the uniform distribution in the Ara h 2 and Ara h 3/4 protein isoforms together with their spectral features under ESI-MS-MS conditions, and good repeatability of LC retention time. Because of the different expression levels, the selection of two different allergenic proteins was proved to be useful in the identification and univocal confirmation of the presence of peanuts in foodstuffs. Using rice crisp and chocolate-based snacks as model food matrix, an LC-MS-MS method with triple quadrupole mass analyzer allowed good detection limits to be obtained for Ara h 2 (5 microg protein g(-1) matrix) and Ara h 3/4 (1 microg protein g(-1) matrix). Linearity of the method was established in the 10-200 microg g(-1) range of peanut proteins in the food matrix investigated.

17854935,"Peanut is an important food commodity in Argentina. Last year Córdoba Province accounted for approximately 96% of the total Argentinian production. Few surveys of peanuts for the natural occurrence of ochratoxins and ochratoxin-producing fungi have been reported. The objectives of this study were to investigate the occurrence of Aspergillus section Nigri and ochratoxin A (OTA) in storage peanuts during a three-month-period. The capacity to produce OTA by Aspergillus section Nigri was also studied. A total of 100 samples were collected from May to July 2004. The frequency of contaminating fungi were determined by surface-disinfection the seeds and plating onto several agar types. Detection of OTA in seed samples was performed using an HPLC method. Strains belonging to Aspergillus section Nigri or Flavi were detected in all seeds samples. From the section Nigri, the species belonging to A. niger aggregate were isolated in 100% of the samples. The main ochratoxigenic specie, A. carbonarius, was present at low levels throughout the study period. OTA was found in 50% of the peanut samples, with mean levels ranging from 5.6 to 130 ng g(-1). The mean value of OTA obtained after the first month of storage (30 ng g(-1)) was significantly higher from those obtained after the second (6.5 ng g(-1)) and third (13 ng g(-1)) month (p<0.0001). One hundred and four (32%) of 322 strains of Aspergillus section Nigri, were OTA producers. The levels of toxin produced ranged from 2 to 24 ng ml(-1) of culture medium (mean level: 12.7 ng ml(-1)). These results indicate that humans and animals being may be frequently exposed to OTA in Argentina through the ingestion of peanut seed and foods based on peanuts.

17574636,"Resveratrol and its derivatives are natural stilbenes associated with many health benefits that include those conferred by their antioxidant and anticancer properties. While stilbenes can be recovered as an extract from a selected number of plants, these products are not suitable for many applications in the food/pharmaceutical sectors due to high levels of impurities as well as the overall low concentration of resveratrol and its derivatives in the extract. To deliver a highly defined and enriched resveratrol product, hairy root cultures of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) were established and tested as a bioproduction system for resveratrol and associated derivatives. Analyses by HPTLC and GC-MS of ethyl acetate extracts showed that a single 24 h sodium acetate elicitation resulted in a 60-fold induction and secretion of trans-resveratrol into the medium of peanut hairy root cultures. trans-Resveratrol accumulated to levels of 98 microg/mg of the dried extract from the medium representing 99% of the total resveratrol produced. Other stilbenes, including trans-pterostilbene, were also detected in the medium. Our results demonstrate the capacity of hairy root cultures as an effective bioprocessing system for valued nutraceuticals like resveratrol and resveratrol derivatives.

The analytical data obtained were used to perform databank searching in combination with de novo sequencing and led to the identification of a multitude of sequence tags for all three peanut allergens. Food processing such as roasting of peanuts is known to affect the stability of proteins and was shown to influence the detection of allergen sequence tags.

When using bagasse as the carbon source, the xylanolytic enzymes that simultaneously accumulated in the broth in a 500 mL Hinton flask after 72 h of cultivation at 50 degrees C were measured as xylanase (14.0 U/mL), beta-xylosidase (74.1 mU/mL), and acetyl esterase (29.1 mU/mL). The optimum pH and temperature for xylanases were 6.0-8.0 and 70 degrees C, respectively. Six proteins with xylanase activity were identified by zymogram analysis of isoelectric focusing gel. This was followed by heat treatment at 70 degrees C for 30 min that eliminated 90% of the beta-xylosidase activity. The xylanase and acetyl esterase activities were still 100%.

Foods from local markets were stored according to usual household habits, freeze-dried, homogenized, and extracted three times with hexane containing butylated hydroxytoluene as a preservative and tocol as an internal standard. A normal-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography system was applied with fluorescence and photodiode array detection that resulted in baseline separation of all eight analytes and the internal standard tocol (To).

17245391,"Indigenous people of the Torres Strait Islands have been concerned about the safety of their traditional seafoods since the discovery of high cadmium levels in the liver and kidney of dugong and turtle in 1996. This study explored links between urinary cadmium levels and consumption frequency of these traditional foods and piloted a community-based methodology to identify potential determinants of cadmium exposure and accumulation. Consultations led to selection of one community for study from which 60 women aged 30 to 50 years participated in health and food frequency survey, urine collection and a routine health check. Urinary cadmium levels were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry; data were analysed using SPSS-14. The geometric mean cadmium level in this group of women was 1.17 (arithmetic mean 1.86) microg/g creatinine with one-third exceeding 2.0 microg/g creatinine. Heavy smoking (>or=300 pack years) was linked to higher cadmium in urine, as was increasing age and waist circumference. Analysis of age-adjusted residuals revealed significant associations (P<0.05) between cadmium level and higher consumption of turtle liver and kidney, locally gathered clams, peanuts, coconut, chocolate and potato chips. Dugong kidney consumption approached significance (P=0.06). Multiple regression revealed that 40% (adjusted r(2)) of variation in cadmium level was explained by the sum of these associated foods plus heavy smoking, age and waist circumference. No relationships between cadmium and pregnancy history were found.

Samples were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for FLA parent compound and metabolites. DNA was isolated from the tissues and subjected to (32)P-post labeling to measure FLA-DNA adducts. The concentrations of unchanged FLA (FLA parent compound) and its metabolites showed an increase for the saturated fat treatment group compared with mono- and polyunsaturated fat groups. The FLA-DNA adduct concentrations were high in tissues of rats that received FLA through saturated fat. The toxicokinetic parameters, concentrations of FLA metabolites and FLA-DNA adduct showed a dose-dependent increase, and this increase was statistically significant (P<.05) for saturated fat.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of potentially mutagenic substances emitted from cooking oils heated at high temperatures. The objective of this study was to investigate whether deep frying with different oils under different conditions leads to the development of PAHs either in the oil or in the fried product (snacks). PAH analysis was carried out with solid-phase extraction followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and spectrofluorometric detection. Different oils were used to fry chips and extruded snacks in different industrial plants (continuous frying) at temperatures between 170 and 205 degrees C, and peanut oil was used to fry French fries and fish (discontinuous frying) at temperatures between 160 and 185 degrees C. No appreciable differences in PAH load was observed in the same oil before and after frying. Both before and after frying, the benzo[a]pyrene concentration in oils ranged from trace to 0.7 ppb.

Further, concentrations in rice were compared to total soil concentrations in paddy fields. Compared to the reference area, food items produced in the contaminated area had increased levels of Cd, Co, Ni and Mn in particular, while levels of Mo were lower. In contrast, total soil concentrations of Cd and Mn in particular have decreased whereas especially Mo was increased. In combination with the observed soil acidification, it is likely that the bioavailable concentration of most elements in the contaminated soil is higher (except for Mo) due to an increased weathering rate and/or input via the contaminated irrigation water. In terms of human health, concentrations in foods were generally within normal literature values.

16160820,"Resveratrol is a phytoalexin produced in various plants like wine, peanut or pine in response to fungal infection or UV irradiation, but it is absent in members of the Brassicaceae. Moreover, resveratrol and its glucoside (piceid) are considered to have beneficial effects on human health, known to reduce heart disease, arteriosclerosis and cancer mortality. Therefore, the introduction of the gene encoding stilbene synthase for resveratrol production in rapeseed is a tempting approach to improve the quality of rapeseed products. The stilbene synthase gene isolated from grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) was cloned under control of the seed-specific napin promotor and introduced into rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) by Agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation together with a ds-RNA-interference construct deduced from the sequence of the key enzyme for sinapate ester biosynthesis, UDP-glucose:sinapate glucosyltransferase (BnSGT1), assuming that the suppression of the sinapate ester biosynthesis may increase the resveratrol production in seeds through the increased availability of the precursor 4-coumarate. Resveratrol glucoside (piceid) was produced at levels up to 361 microg/g in the seeds of the primary transformants. This value exceeded by far piceid amounts reported from B. napus expressing VST1 in the wild type sinapine background. There was no significant difference in other important agronomic traits, like oil, protein, fatty acid and glucosinolate content in comparison to the control plants. In the third seed generation, up to 616 microg/g piceid was found in the seeds of a homozygous T3-plant with a single transgene copy integrated. The sinapate ester content in this homozygous T3-plant was reduced from 7.43 to 2.40 mg/g. These results demonstrate how the creation of a novel metabolic sink could divert the synthesis towards the production of piceid rather than sinapate ester, thereby increasing the value of oilseed products.",TAG.

15913323,"Peanuts are one of the most common and severe food allergens. Nevertheless, the occurrence of peanut allergy varies between countries and depends on both the exposure and the way peanuts are consumed. Processing is known to influence the allergenicity of peanut proteins. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of thermal processing on the IgE-binding capacity of whole peanut protein extracts and of the major peanut allergens Ara h 1 and Ara h 2. Whole proteins, Ara h 1, and Ara h 2 were extracted and purified from raw, roasted and boiled peanuts using selective precipitation and multiple chromatographic steps, and were then characterized by electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The immunoreactivity of whole peanut extracts and purified proteins was analyzed by the enzyme allergosorbent test (EAST) and EAST inhibition using the sera of 37 peanut-allergic patients. The composition of the whole protein extracts was modified after heat processing, especially after boiling. The electrophoretic pattern showed protein bands of low molecular weight that were less marked in boiled than in raw and roasted peanuts. The same low-molecular-weight proteins were found in the cooking water of peanuts. Whole peanut protein extracts obtained after the different processes were all recognized by the IgE of the 37 patients. The IgE-binding capacity of the whole peanut protein extracts prepared from boiled peanuts was 2-fold lower than that of the extracts prepared from raw and roasted peanuts. No significant difference was observed between protein extracts from raw and roasted peanuts. It is noteworthy that the proteins present in the cooking water were also recognized by the IgE of peanut-allergic patients. IgE immunoreactivity of purified Ara h 1 and Ara h 2 prepared from roasted peanuts was higher than that of their counterparts prepared from raw and boiled peanuts. The IgE-binding capacity of purified Ara h 1 and Ara h 2 was altered by heat treatment and in particular was increased by roasting. However, no significant difference in IgE immunoreactivity was observed between whole protein extracts from raw and roasted peanuts.

Fish treated with TNT had an increased glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and glutathione reductase (GR) activity, and a decreased percentage of oxidised glutathione (%GSSG) compared to the control group. In addition to increased methemoglobin, the increased glutathione and glutathione dependent enzyme activities indicate that TNT oxidises macromolecules and activates antioxidant defence systems which may be useful as general biomarkers of TNT-exposure. The fish bile was analysed for TNT and its metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the toxicity of the bile was determined with the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia. A dose-dependent increase in TNT, 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT) was found in the hydrolysed bile of the TNT-treated fish. These results indicate that the fish are able to detoxify and excrete TNT and suggest that the detection of TNT, 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT in bile may be suitable as a direct marker of exposure to TNT.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000704', 'D000818', 'D001646', 'D015415', 'D033361', 'D004305', 'D004784', 'D008401', 'D019803', 'D005980', 'D005982', 'D007113', 'D007274', 'D008099', 'D008706', 'D017686', 'D014303']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Bile', 'Biomarkers', 'Cladocera', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Glutathione Disulfide', 'Glutathione Reductase', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Liver', 'Methemoglobin', 'Oncorhynchus mykiss', 'Trinitrotoluene']","Tentative biomarkers for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in fish (Oncorhynchus mykiss).","[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000276', 'Q000008']","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', None, 'methods', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'immunology', 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15820102,2005

In recent years an increasing prevalence of peanut allergies both in children and adults has been observed in the USA and in Europe. In vitro identification and characterization of allergens including those from peanut have been frequently performed by Western blotting. However this method may alter the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody reactivity since the proteins are denatured by detergent treatment and/or reduction of disulfide bonds by reducing reagents and does not answer the question how peanut allergens interact with the human digestive apparatus and immune system. Size exclusion chromatography of peanut extract shows that approximately 90% of the total protein content is eluted as one peak in the exclusion volume with a molecular mass of over 200 kDa. The proteins of this fraction were analyzed by blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), immunoblotting, two-dimensional PAGE and Western blotting. A complex of Ara h 1 (Acc. no.

A comparison of the peanut allergen sequences of Ara h 3/4, Ara h 3, Ara h 4 and peanut trypsin inhibitor (AF487543) and the proteins Gly 1 and iso-Ara h 3, not yet described as allergens, leads to the conclusion that these proteins are isoallergens of each other.

Several peptides obtained from the enzymatic digestion of the most abundant peanut allergen, Ara h 1, were identified as specific peptide biomarkers for peanut protein. Using ice cream as a model food matrix, a method was developed for the detection of the allergen peptide biomarkers. A key component of the method was the use of molecular mass cutoff filters to enrich the Ara h 1 in the protein extracts. By applying the method to ice cream samples containing various levels of peanut protein, levels as low as 10 mg/kg of Ara h 1 could routinely be detected. This method provides an unambiguous means of confirming the presence of the peanut allergen, Ara h 1, in foods and can easily be modified to detect other food allergens.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000485', 'D000595', 'D052179', 'D002851', 'D005504', 'D006023', 'D007054', 'D013058', 'D008565', 'D008969', 'D010940']","['Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Glycoproteins', 'Ice Cream', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Proteins']","Confirmation of the allergenic peanut protein, Ara h 1, in a model food matrix using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).","['Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15137814,2004
15137476,"The most widely used ingredients in food formulation are proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. Proteins-lipids and proteins-polysaccharides interactions play a key role in the structure, stability, sensorial and nutritional properties of formulated foods. The objective of the present study is to highlight the importance of proteins-lipids and proteins-polysaccharides interactions, on the immuno-reactivity of allergenic proteins. Two models have been studied, on the one hand refined and not refined oils (soya and sunflower) and soya lecithin, on the other hand mixtures based on peanut proteins and polysaccharides (arabic gum, pectin, xylan). STUDY OF OILS: We have extracted proteins, using a PBS buffer, from refined and not refined oils from soya, sunflower and from soya lecithin, determined protein concentrations and identified allergenic proteins using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immuno-blotting. Phospholipids are determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The protein determination and SDS-PAGE show the presence of a higher amount of proteins in not refined oils and lecithin as compared to refined oils. An important amount of proteins associated to phospholipids are eliminated by degumming on the form of lecithin. On the other hand, residual proteins from refined oils are accompanied by phospholipids. Immuno-blots reveal the presence of a 56 kDa allergen in oils issued from soya seeds and soya lecithin, and the presence of a 67 kDa allergen in oils issued from sunflower seeds. We conclude that the presence or elimination of proteins, especially allergens from oils is linked to amphiphilic association to phospholipids. STUDY OF PEANUT PROTEINS-POLYSACCHARIDES MIXTURES: We have digested in vitro proteins in a dialysis bag using a multi-enzymatic method and characterized proteins and peptides using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immuno-blotting. Our results confirm that peanut proteins alone are digested by proteases and that a number of large peptides still have epitopes recognized by anti-peanut proteins antibodies. Our results also show that the presence of polysaccharides changes the peptidic profile after digestion and that, depending on the polysaccharide type, smaller or larger peptides can be obtained in the dialysis bag. Smaller peptides are obtained using pectin whereas larger peptides are obtained using arabic gum and xylan. In the latter case, an increasing amount of peptides reacts to antibodies. Our first observations clearly show the need to better understand modifications of proteins allergenicity induced by the presence of other ingredients such as polysaccharides and lipids, in relation to technological treatments.",European annals of allergy and clinical immunology,"['D000485', 'D010367', 'D004040', 'D004041', 'D004044', 'D004527', 'D004591', 'D010450', 'D005504', 'D005512', 'D006023', 'D006801', 'D015151', 'D007073', 'D066298', 'D046911', 'D008970', 'D009584', 'D010455', 'D010743', 'D010938', 'D011134', 'D030262']","['Allergens', 'Arachis', 'Dietary Carbohydrates', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Egg Proteins', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endopeptidases', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nitrogen', 'Peptides', 'Phospholipids', 'Plant Oils', 'Polysaccharides', 'Soybean Proteins']",[Food allergy: effect of proteins-lipids and proteins-polysaccharides interactions].,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000276', 'Q000276', 'Q000276', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000276', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'immunology', 'immunology', 'immunology', 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, 'immunology', 'chemistry', None, None, 'immunology', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15137476,2004
15030196,"In this work the quantitative determination and analytical speciation of arsenic were undertaken in different types of nuts, randomly purchased from local markets. The hardness of the whole nuts and high lipid content made the preparation of this material difficult for analysis. The lack of sample homogeneity caused irreproducible results. To improve the precision of analysis, arsenic was determined separately in nut oil and in the defatted sample. The lipids were extracted from the ground sample with the two portions of a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1). The defatted material was dried and ground again, yielding a fine powder. The nut oil was obtained by combining the two organic extracts and by evaporating the solvents. The two nut fractions were microwave digested, and total arsenic was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results obtained for oils from different types of nuts showed element concentration in the range 2.9-16.9 ng g(-)(1). Lower levels of arsenic were found in defatted material (<0.1 ng g(-)(1) with the exception of Brazil nuts purchased with and without shells, 3.0 and 2.8 ng g(-)(1) respectively). For speciation analysis of arsenic in nut oils, elemental species were extracted from 2 g of oil with 12 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 8 mL of deionized water. The aqueous layer, containing polar arsenic species, was evaporated and the residue dissolved and analyzed by ion chromatography-ICP-MS. The anion exchange chromatography enabled separation of As(III), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAs(V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAs(V)), and As(V) within 8 min. Several types of nuts were analyzed, including walnuts, Brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, pine nuts, peanuts, pistachio nuts, and sunflower seeds. The recovery for the speciation procedure was in the range 72.7-90.6%. The primary species found in the oil extracts were As(III) and As(V). The arsenic concentration levels in these two species were 0.7-12.7 and 0.5-4.3 ng g(-)(1), respectively. The contribution of As in DMAs(V) ranged from 0.1 +/- 0.1 ng g(-)(1) in walnuts to 1.3 +/- 0.3 ng g(-)(1) in pine nuts.

One of the three major allergens in peanut, Ara h 2, is a member of the conglutin family of seed storage proteins. Ara h 2 shows high sequence homology to proteins of the 2S albumin family. Presently, only very few structural data from allergenic proteins of this family exist. For a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of food-induced allergies and for the development of therapeutic strategies knowledge of the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of allergenic proteins is essential. We report a method for the efficient large-scale preparation of properly folded Ara h 2 for structural studies and report CD-spectroscopic data. In contrast to other allergenic 2S albumins, Ara h 2 exists as a single continuous polypeptide chain in peanut seeds, and thus heterologous expression in Escherichia coli was possible. Ara h 2 was expressed as Trx-His-tag fusion protein in E. coli Origami (DE3), a modified E. coli strain with oxidizing cytoplasm which allows the formation of disulfide bridges.

Dry-grinding peanuts for homogenization of aflatoxins produced high temperatures that killed most of the A. flavus/A. parasiticus propagules. Addition of water to produce a slurry kept the temperature from rising above levels that killed the fungi. A 7 min grind time provided optimal homogenization for both the fungi and aflatoxins, so long as the temperature of the slurry did not exceed 45 degrees C. In the analysis of 60 shelled peanut samples, total aflatoxin concentrations ranged from 0 to 10,000 ng/g and total A. flavus/A. parasiticus ranged from 1.4 x 10(3) to 3.2 x 10(6) CFU/g. Regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation (p < 0.0001) between the quantities of A. flavus/A. parasiticus and aflatoxin (R2 = 0.82).",Journal of AOAC International,"['D000348', 'D010367', 'D001230', 'D001231', 'D002623', 'D002853', 'D015169', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D013696', 'D014867']","['Aflatoxins', 'Arachis', 'Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Temperature', 'Water']",Simultaneous quantitation of Aspergillus flavus/A. parasiticus and aflatoxins in peanuts.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000302', 'Q000302', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', None, 'methods', 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12180687,2003
12115809,"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of lipids on the pharmacokinetics of halofantrine enantiomers. Rats were given (+/-)-halofantrine HCl 2 mg/kg i.v., or 7 mg/kg orally. Some rats were rendered hyperlipidemic by intraperitoneal administration of poloxamer 407 1 g/kg, followed by (+/-)-halofantrine HCl intravenously. In other normolipidemic rats, (+/-)-halofantrine was administered under fasted conditions, or after peanut oil given orally. Halofantrine enantiomer plasma concentrations were considerably (>10-fold) increased in hyperlipidemia. Decreases were noted in the clearance, volume of distribution and the unbound fraction in plasma of the hyperlipidemic rats. Peanut oil caused a significant 28% reduction in clearance of the (-), but not the (+) enantiomer (mean clearance reduced 11%) of halofantrine. After oral halofantrine, peanut oil resulted in a two- to threefold increase in the plasma area under the curves of halofantrine enantiomers. Halofantrine enantiomer pharmacokinetics are highly dependent upon plasma lipid concentrations. Oral lipids may result in a stereoselective interaction at the level of clearance. Because lipids may affect clearance of drugs that bind to lipoproteins, in determining bioavailability of such drugs in food-effect studies, reference intravenous groups should be included to separate true increase in bioavailability from the effects of decreased clearance.",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,"['D000284', 'D000818', 'D000962', 'D019540', 'D001682', 'D001798', 'D002784', 'D002851', 'D004041', 'D018565', 'D006949', 'D007275', 'D050356', 'D008055', 'D008074', 'D008297', 'D000074241', 'D010616', 'D010938', 'D020442', 'D011485', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D013237', 'D014280']","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Availability', 'Blood Proteins', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dietary Fats', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Hyperlipidemias', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids', 'Lipoproteins', 'Male', 'Peanut Oil', 'Phenanthrenes', 'Plant Oils', 'Poloxamer', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Triglycerides']",The influence of lipids on stereoselective pharmacokinetics of halofantrine: Important implications in food-effect studies involving drugs that bind to lipoproteins.,"[None, None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000097', 'Q000097', None, None, 'Q000008', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', None, None, None, None, 'Q000097']","[None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'metabolism', 'blood', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'blood', 'blood', None, None, 'administration & dosage', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', None, None, None, None, 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12115809,2003

12009972,"Aflatoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus are commonly found in human and animal foods including grains, cereals, peanut products, sorghum, and soy seeds. Exposure to aflatoxins has been associated with carcinogenicity. This paper reports a simple, portable, and rapid fluorescence polarization (FP) assay for aflatoxin determination in grains. This immunoassay is field portable, homogeneous, and without any washing and cleaning steps. The assay is based upon the competition between free aflatoxin and an aflatoxin-fluorescein tracer for an aflatoxin-specific monoclonal antibody in solution. A series of naturally contaminated corn, sorghum, peanut butter, and peanut paste samples were analyzed by FP and compared with HPLC results. Similarly, spiked popcorn samples were analyzed by FP. FP results of naturally contaminated samples correlated well with HPLC (r (2) = 0.97). FP analysis of spiked popcorn samples (with a mixture of B(1)/B(2)/G(1)/G(2), 7/1/3/1, w/w) gave a good correlation with spiked values (r (2) = 0.99). However, FP consistently underestimated the aflatoxin contents. This was perhaps due to low cross-reactivity of the antibody used toward B(2), G(1), and G(2) aflatoxins. These results combined with the portability and simplicity of the assay suggest that the assay can be used for screening total aflatoxin in grains.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000348', 'D000818', 'D010367', 'D001667', 'D002851', 'D004355', 'D002523', 'D005454', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D007202', 'D012680', 'D003313']","['Aflatoxins', 'Animals', 'Arachis', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Stability', 'Edible Grain', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Zea mays']",Development of a fluorescence polarization assay for the determination of aflatoxins in grains.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12009972,2002

11982442,"Peanut lots are subject to aflatoxin levels high enough to cause concern to health agencies and trade channels. A possible solution would be to mechanically sort out high aflatoxin nuts from the process stream. Only highly contaminated nuts would need to be removed. However, there exists at present no sorting mechanism which meets commercial needs of adequate reduction and product preservation. To build such a sorter requires knowledge of the properties that can be used for sorting. The first step in the design is to select on the order of one hundred undamaged contaminated nuts which can be compared with noncontaminated ones. Because contaminated nuts are rare, a very large number of nuts needs to be examined nondestructively. We present a method to rapidly carry out such a selection. The method is based on dipping nuts into extraction fluid and examining the resulting fluid by tandem MS without preliminary cleanup. This method has been applied to examine over 65,000 nuts, yielding approximately 120 nuts, each containing more than 250-43000 ng/g aflatoxin (depending on process stream).",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000348', 'D010367', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D013058', 'D012996']","['Aflatoxins', 'Arachis', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Solutions']","Rapid, non-destructive selection of peanuts for high aflatoxin content by soaking and tandem mass spectrometry.","['Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11982442,2002

11339268,"One of the most important concerns in the decontamination of aflatoxin-containing feed commodities is the safety of the products for food-producing animals and for human consumption of products derived from these animals. A new method, based on the use of florisil and C18 solid phase extraction columns, was developed for the preparation of extracts from decontaminated peanut meal, which allowed testing with in vitro genotoxicity assays without interference of the residual aflatoxin B1. Recovery of degradation products in the extracts was evaluated by the use of radiolabelled [14C]-aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) added to naturally-contaminated peanut meal (3.5 mg AFB1/kg). The meal was treated by a small-scale version of an industrial decontamination process based on ammoniation. Following decontamination, more than 90% of the label could not be extracted from the meal. AFB1 accounted for about 10% of the radiolabel present in the extractable fraction, indicating a total AFB1 reduction of more than 99%. Decontamination of the meal by a number of other small- and industrial-scale ammonia-based processes resulted in similar efficiencies. Application of the extraction procedure resulted in AFB1-rich and AFB1-poor fractions, the latter containing half of the extractable decontamination products but less than 1% of the residual AFB1. Testing in the Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay (TA 100, with S9-mix) of the original crude extracts and AFB1-rich fractions prepared from non-treated and decontaminated meal, showed the positive results expected from the AFB1 contents as determined by HPLC analysis. Analysis and testing of the AFB1-poor fractions showed that the various decontamination processes not only resulted in a successful degradation of AFB1 but also did not produce other potent mutagenic compounds. Slight positive results obtained with these extracts were similar for the untreated and treated meals and may be due to unknown compounds originally present in the meal. Results obtained with an unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) and Comet assay with rat hepatocytes supported this conclusion. Positive results obtained with the micronucleus assay, using immortalized mouse hepatocytes (GKB), did not clearly reflect the mycotoxin levels and require further examination. It is concluded that the newly developed extraction procedure yields highly reproducible fractions and hence is very suitable for examining the possible formation of less potent degradation products of aflatoxins in short-term genotoxicity tests.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000348', 'D000821', 'D000818', 'D010367', 'D002851', 'D003666', 'D004586', 'D008297', 'D009152', 'D051381', 'D011916', 'D012680']","['Aflatoxins', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arachis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Decontamination', 'Electrophoresis', 'Male', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']","Genotoxicity testing of extracts from aflatoxin-contaminated peanut meal, following chemical decontamination.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11339268,2001

11312807,"Peanut and its derivatives, especially peanut butter, are extensively consumed in many countries, mainly in the United States, which is also the major exporter of these products. trans-Resveratrol is present in peanuts, and recently this compound has been quantified in peanut butter. It is well-known that there are beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, the piceid, in health. The absorption of trans-resveratrol has been proven in animals, and certain studies show that the absorption of some phenols is enhanced by conjugation with glucose, so that it could be possible that trans-piceid would be more absorbed than its aglycon (trans-resveratrol). In our work, we have identified the presence of trans-piceid in peanut butter with a new method to quantify trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid (3-beta-glucose of trans-resveratrol). This fact is very interesting because the glucosilated form could be more easily absorbed by the intestinal gut; in this way trans-piceid would exercise its beneficial function more efficiently than trans-resveratrol.

10910733,"We previously cloned a panel of peanut allergens by phage display technology. Examination of the codons used in these sequences indicated that most of the cDNAs contain an excess of the least used codons in Escherichia coli, namely AGG/AGA, that correspond to a minor tRNA, the product of the dnaY gene. To achieve high-level expression of the peanut allergens, the cDNAs were subcloned into an expression vector of the pET series (Novagen) in order to produce (His)(10)-tagged fusion proteins in conventional E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The peanut allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 6 with an AGG/AGA codon content of 8-10% were only marginally expressed, whereas the peanut profilin Ara h 5, with an AGG/AGA codon content of only 0.8%, was efficiently expressed in these cells. Hence, by using modified BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, namely BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) with extra copies of E. coli argU, ileY, and leuW tRNA genes, it was possible to attain high-level expression of the proteins affected by rare codon usage. IPTG-induced expression of several recombinant peanut allergens, such as Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 6, was greatly increased in these special cells compared to the expression yield achieved by conventional E. coli hosts. The purification of the soluble and the insoluble fraction of Ara h 2 was performed by metal-affinity chromatography and yielded a total of about 30 mg (His)(10)-tagged recombinant protein per liter of culture of transformed BL21(DE3)CodonPlus-RIL cells.

For analysis of foods by gas chromatography (GC), sample preparation may include mincing, homogenation, centrifugation, distillation, simple solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized-fluid extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, Soxhlet extraction, or methylation. For high-performance liquid chromatography of amines in fish, cheese, sausage and olive oil or aldehydes in fruit juice, sample preparation may include solvent extraction and derivatization.

Twenty-two peanut and eight corn products from Malaysia and the Philippines were analysed for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2 firstly by the MFC method and then by the IMC method. For peanut products, 14 out of 22 samples were positive by the two methods in the range of 1-378 micrograms/kg of AF, and correlation coefficients (r) for AFB1 and AFB2 were 0.987 and 0.997, respectively. For corn and corn products, all the samples were positive in the range of 1-130 micrograms/kg, and r values were 0.992 and 0.805 for AFB1 and AFB2 respectively. Thus, the results were significantly (p < 0.01) in close agreement, particularly for lower range of 1-50 micrograms/kg of AF concentrations in all the samples.

Data on mothers' milk FA and dietary habits which allowed food selection were recently published (Rocquelin et al., 1998). Most foods were locally produced. Food samples were collected at local markets, bleached if necessary to avoid microbial degradation, and stored at +4 degrees C or -20 degrees C. They were lyophilized upon their arrival in the laboratory before lipid analyses. FA composition of food lipids was determined by capillary gas chromatography. Staple diets included low-fat, high-carbohydrate foods (processed cassava roots, wheat bread) and high-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) foods: soybean oil (high in 18 : 2 n-6 and alpha-18 : 3 n-3), bushbutter (dacryodes edulis), peanuts, avocado (high in fat and 18 : 2 n-6), freshwater and salt-water fish (high in LC n-3 and/or n-6 PUFA), and leafy green vegetables (low in fat but very high in alpha-18 : 3 n-3). Their frequent consumption by nursing mothers provided enough EFA to meet requirements due to lactation. It also explains why mothers' breast milk was rich in C8-C14 saturated FA (26% of total FA) and in n-6, n-3 PUFA (respectively 15.0% and 2.4% of total FA) highly profitable for breastfed infants' development.

9325571,"Immunoaffinity columns (IACs) are widely used for cleanup and isolation of mycotoxins extracted from foods and biological fluids, particularly aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and fumonisins. The columns are prepared by binding antibodies specific for a given mycotoxin to a specially activated solid-phase support and packing the support suspended in aqueous buffer solution into a cartridge. The mycotoxin in the extract or fluid binds to the antibody, impurities are removed with water or aqueous solution, and then the mycotoxin is desorbed with a miscible solvent such as methanol. Further separation can be performed with IAC, followed by liquid chromatographic (LC) quantitation, either off-line or on-line in an automated system, or by fluorometry. IACs have been used by laboratories that developed the antibodies but are also available commercially for aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, zearalenone, and deoxynivalenol. Among commercial IACs, Aflatest P is used as the cleanup step in an LC method and in a solution fluorometry method for corn, peanuts, and peanut butter that was adopted as an AOAC INTERNATIONAL Official Method after evaluation by an international collaborative study. As part of a fluorometer-based test kit, aflatest P was further certified by the AOAC Research Institute to measure total aflatoxins in 10 grains and grain products. IACs can concentrate the analyte from a large amount of sample, allowing detection limits at low parts-per-trillion levels in some cases (e.g., for aflatoxin M1 and ochratoxin A in liquid food matrixes).

9552426,"The influence of simulated high-fat meals on drug release from beads coated with modified-release ethylcellulose coating formulations was investigated as a function of plasticizer type and concentration, and coating level. Ethylcellulose-coated beads were soaked in peanut oil prior to testing to simulate the influence of concomitant administration of the dosage form with ingestion of fatty meals. The USP apparatus 3 dissolution procedure was employed to study the drug release properties of the beads. It was found that the ethylcellulose-coated beads plasticized with either triethyl citrate (TEC) or dibutyl sebacate (DBS) had faster drug release rates after the peanut oil treatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the peanut oil soak caused the polymeric films to detach from the surface of the bead, producing a series of uneven ridges and cracks in the coating. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) demonstrated that the glass transition temperature was increased for DBS-plasticized films soaked in peanut oil, and that it was not influenced for TEC plasticized films. Similar results were found for the puncture strength, percent elongation, and modulus of elasticity for the DBS- and TEC-plasticized films soaked in peanut oil. The results verified that the DBS was solubilized and extracted from the plasticized film during the peanut oil soak, and that the film plasticized with the TEC was not significantly affected by the peanut oil soak.

8946711,"The suitability of 3 methods for determining aflatoxins in melon seeds was examined. The first 2 are the Contaminants Branch (CB) method and the Best Foods (BF) method, both official methods for determining aflatoxins in peanuts and peanut products. The third method, the modified CB method-Rapid Modification of the Cottonseed (CB-RCS-Mod) method, devised in this work, was derived by combining steps from the CB method and the Rapid Modification of the Cottonseed method. The CB method was superior to the other 2 methods for quantitation of aflatoxins. It gave better recoveries and cleaner extracts that exhibit less fluorescent interference for thin-layer chromatography (TLC) than the BF method. Also, its solvent efficiency was better than that of the CB-RCS-Mod method. With the CB method, recoveries from spiked samples were 85.0% for aflatoxin B1 and 90.0% for aflatoxin B2. Recoveries of G aflatoxins were more variable, averaging 90.0% for aflatoxin G1 and 72.5% for aflatoxin G2. Total aflatoxin recovery was 86.5% for the CB method. At a low aflatoxin contamination level (8 micrograms B1/kg sample), aflatoxin B1 was detectable by the CB method but not by the BF method.

The determination of naphthalene in the packaging material by gas chromatography showed levels of naphthalene ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 micrograms g-1. Analysis of the milk samples at the time of purchase by gas chromatography after extraction using a Dean and Stark apparatus showed levels of naphthalene in the range 0.01-0.03 microgram ml-1. The level of contamination in milk increased with storage time at room temperature (25 degrees C) and, depending on the concentration of naphthalene in the packaging material, values of 0.08-0.27 microgram ml-1 were found at the expiry date. Migration studies were carried out using peanut oil as a food stimulant. The amount of naphthalene extracted by milk from the polyethylene at 25 degrees C over a period of 60 d was related to the amount that could be extracted using peanut oil at 66 degrees C for 30 h.

8012216,"Suitability of the negative binomial function for use in estimating the distribution of sample aflatoxin test results associated with testing farmers' stock peanuts for aflatoxin was studied. A 900 kg portion of peanut pods was removed from each of 40 contaminated farmers' stock lots. The lots averaged about 4100 kg. Each 900 kg portion was divided into fifty 2.26 kg samples, fifty 4.21 kg samples, and fifty 6.91 kg samples. The aflatoxin in each sample was quantified by liquid chromatography. An observed distribution of sample aflatoxin test results consisted of 50 aflatoxin test results for each lot and each sample size. The mean aflatoxin concentration, m; the variance, S2 mean among the 50 sample aflatoxin test results; and the shape parameter, k, for the negative binomial function were determined for each of the 120 observed distributions (40 lots times 3 sample sizes). Regression analysis indicated the functional relationship between k and m to be k = 0.000006425m0.8047. The 120 observed distributions of sample aflatoxin test results were compared to the negative binomial function by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The null hypothesis that the true unknown distribution function was negative binomial was not rejected at the 5% significance level for 114 of the 120 distributions. The negative binomial function failed the KS test at a sample concentration of 0 ng/g in all 6 of the distributions where the negative binomial function was rejected. The negative binomial function always predicted a smaller percentage of samples testing 0 ng/g than was actually observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Journal of AOAC International,"['D000348', 'D000383', 'D010367', 'D005506', 'D008433', 'D012044']","['Aflatoxins', 'Agriculture', 'Arachis', 'Food Contamination', 'Mathematics', 'Regression Analysis']",Predicting the distribution of aflatoxin test results from farmers' stock peanuts.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8012216,1994

Eighteen artificially contaminated samples plus blanks of raw peanuts and peanut butter and corn containing varying amounts of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 were distributed to participating laboratories. The method consists of elements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Contaminants Branch (CB) (AOAC Method 968.22) and FDA, Best Foods (BF) (AOAC Method 970.45) methods with reduced requirements for solvents. Participating laboratories used either visual or densitometric techniques during the final determinative step. Statistical analysis of the data was performed to determine or confirm outliers and to compute repeatability and reproducibility of the method using either visual or densitometric techniques for the determinative step. Reported results from laboratories using a densitometer showed that, for corn, the relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) for aflatoxin B1 ranged from 56.6 to 41.7% for contamination levels ranging from 5 to 50 ng/g.

Almost 77% of the isolates produced aflatoxin; aflatoxins B1 and B2 were formed by most of the isolates. Simultaneous production of aflatoxins of groups B and G was detected in only 0.5% of the isolates. Microscopic examination revealed that 98% of the isolates were A. flavus and only 2% A. parasiticus. Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) was detected in 22.5% of the isolates, including 3.5% that produced only CPA. Sterigmatocystin was detected in only 2% of the isolates and only one isolate produced aflatoxin simultaneously with CPA and sterigmatocystin. The dry weight (DW) of mycelium, 7 days after inoculating the medium, was between 71-110 mg/30 ml medium in more than 70% of the isolates. A general decrease in the pH was observed and 75% of the isolates reduced the pH to 4.5 or below. After 14 days, a small increase in DW and an increase in the pH toward neutrality was observed.

8318839,"The precision parameters of the method-performance (collaborative) studies for mycotoxins published in the literature through 1991 have been recalculated on a uniform basis by following the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry protocol. About 80% of the 793 accepted assays for mycotoxins, almost all of which have been conducted by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), liquid chromatography (LC), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), exhibit relative standard deviations among laboratories (RSDR) that are less than 2 times the values predicted from the Horwitz equation: RSDR, % = 2(1-0.5log10C) where C is the concentration expressed as a decimal fraction. The precision of TLC and LC methods is about the same, but that of ELISA is somewhat poorer. For those commodities for which sufficient data exist to provide a meaningful comparison, the methods applied to cottonseed products have the best precision and corn the worst, with peanuts intermediate. Overall, however, the primary factor affecting RSDR is concentration, more or less independent of analyte, method, matrix, and age of the study. If it is assumed that the test results are normally distributed and that an RSDR of 50% is the point where effective control of the results begins to be lost (a value equivalent to the production of 2% false-negative values), then relying on the Horwitz curve, the limit of quantitative measurement is the single digit, i.e., 5, micrograms/kg (10(-9); ppb) concentration for solid food commodities. Such a value must be considered as a limit applicable to a single analyte, aflatoxin B1, and not as a mean, and not applicable to the sum of the individual components, each of whose associated standard deviation would lie in the unacceptable region. Enforcement of a 5 micrograms aflatoxin B1/kg limit, under the assumptions made, requires that a responsible manufacturer and a prudent regulator operate at opposite extremes of tolerance limits: e.g., the producer at 2 micrograms/kg and the consumer at 10. A proposed Codex ""maximum level"" of 0.05 micrograms aflatoxin M1/kg milk cannot be supported by the available data applied in an interlaboratory enforcement environment.

Addition of unlabeled T4 displaced [125I]T4 from the 55-kDa site and unmasked an adjacent site of higher molecular weight. E2 increased the proportion of T4 bound to the low-affinity (150 kDa) site relative to that bound to the high-affinity (55 kDa) site, increased the level of protein associated with the 1,500-kDa site and its T4 binding, and also initiated the production of presumed vitellogenin (VTG), which bound a small amount of T4.

1757420,"A liquid chromatographic (LC) technique has been developed that uses the Mycosep multifunctional cleanup (MFC) column. MFC columns provide a rapid 1-step extract purification. They are designed to retain particular groups of compounds that may create interferences in analytical methods. At the same time, MFC columns allow compounds of interest to pass through. In the method presented, test samples are extracted in a blender with acetonitrile-water (9 + 1). A portion of the extract is forced through an MFC column designed especially for analysis of numerous mycotoxins. Analytical interferences are retained, while aflatoxins pass through the column. Aflatoxins B1 and G1 are converted to their hemiacetals by heating a mixture of purified extract and water-trifluoroacetic acid-acetic acid (7 + 2 + 1) at 65 degrees C for 8.5 min.

31051606,"Randomly chosen, commercially available, market basket samples of on-the-shelf brands of peanut butter were routinely tested for the presence of aflatoxin from 1982 to 1989. Standard analytical procedures were employed which included high performance liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography. During the eight years studied, 74% of the samples were positive for the presence of aflatoxin. Of those samples testing positive which excluded no detect samples or ""zero values"", 8.6% were found to be contaminated between 20 and 50 ppb, 3.7% were between 50 and 100 ppb, and 2.2% were above 100 ppb. The total for this evaluation approach was 14.5%. When all samples including nondetectable were considered, only 9.8% of 2510 samples exceeded the U.S. Food and Drug Administration action level for total aflatoxin. With the exception of 1986 and 1987, aflatoxin levels in commercially available peanut butter offered for sale to the public in this particular state have been well controlled. It is a monitoring effort such as this, conducted as checks on the final product on sale to the public, that provides the final line to protect public health from exposure to mycotoxins. Based on these regional data for an eight-year period reported herein, it is apparent that the findings could be used in conjunction with other regional and national studies to support a reduction of the 20 ppb U.S. action level.",Journal of food protection,[],[],The Occurrence of Aflatoxin in Peanut Butter From 1982 to 1989.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31051606,2019
1880317,"Peanuts are among the most common causes of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to foods. Serum from nine patients with atopic dermatitis and a positive double-blind, placebo-controlled, food challenge to peanut were used to begin the process of identification and purification of the major peanut allergens. Identification of a major peanut allergen was accomplished by use of anion-exchange column chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, thin-layer isoelectric focusing, and IgE-specific immunoblotting. Anion-exchange chromatography revealed several fractions that bound IgE from the serum of the challenge-positive patient pool. By measuring antipeanut-specific IgE in the ELISA and in IgE-specific immunoblotting, we identified an allergenic component with two Coomassie brilliant blue staining bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a mean molecular weight of 63.5 kd. Examination of this fraction by the IgE antipeanut ELISA with individual serum and by the ELISA-inhibition assay with pooled serum, we identified this fraction as a major allergen. Thin-layer isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting of this 63.5 kd fraction revealed it to have an isoelectric point of 4.55.

1917816,"A modified version of the Conditt and Baumgardner gas chromatographic/mass spectroscopic (GC/MS) method for determination of daminozide in peanut butter and raw peanuts is described. Daminozide in the food product is hydrolyzed to unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) by sodium hydroxide digestion. The generated UDMH is distilled from the food matrix and captured by reaction with salicylaldehyde in a condensation trap. Resulting high pH distillates generated by peanuts and peanut products are adjusted back to a pH of 5-6 through addition of glacial acetic acid. After thermal incubation and extraction into methylene chloride, salicylaldehyde dimethylhydrazone is separated from interferences by capillary GC and quantitated by MS using the selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Quantitation of daminozide is based on the ratio of the salicylaldehyde dimethylhydrazone molecular ion (m/z 164) to the molecular ion (m/z 153) of the internal standard, 4-nitroanisole. Confirmation of daminozide identity is determined by relative intensity of the m/z 164 ion to the m/z 120 (C7H4ON) ion. Improved m/z 164 ion intensity and reduction of neighboring interferences due to acetic acid treatment permitted a daminozide detection limit of 0.005 ppm in a 50 g sample and an associated 0.02 ppm limit of quantitation.

2175457,"The cadmium mobilizing properties of two newly synthesized esters of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid in mice have been examined. They are: di(2'-methoxyethyl) meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate ([-CH(SH)COOCH2CH2OR]2, R = CH3; MEDMS), and di(2'-ethoxyethyl) meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate ([-CH(SH)COOCH2CH2OR]2, R = CH2CH3; EEDMS), conveniently prepared from dimercaptosuccinate acid with 2-methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol, respectively. Mobilization studies in mice of aged in vivo cadmium deposits using five ip injections of 0.40 mmol/kg of each chelator in peanut oil clearly indicate that both compounds, MEDMS and EEDMS, are significantly superior to 2,3-dimercaptopropan-1-ol (BAL) in depleting the whole body burden of cadmium. The reductions caused by MEDMS and EEDMS were approximately 20 and 26%, respectively, whereas under similar dosage regimens BAL effected about only a 12% reduction. The esters were neither equal nor superior to BAL for the reduction of renal cadmium levels, MEDMS being the least effective. For the mobilization of hepatic cadmium deposits, both were quite promising (MEDMS, 20%; EEDMS, 34% reduction) compared to BAL (only 2% reduction). There was no accumulation of cadmium with either MEDMS or EEDMS in any of the other organs examined--spleen, testes, pancreas, and particularly the brain. These compounds enhance the fecal excretion of cadmium by a factor of 25- to 40-fold but have very little effect on the urinary excretion of this element.

2808244,"Methyl bromide (MB, bromomethane) is determined in a variety of foods by headspace capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection. The comminuted food sample as an aqueous sodium sulfate slurry is equilibrated with stirring for 1 h at room temperature before a 1 mL headspace aliquot is removed and injected using a modified on-column syringe needle. Methyl bromide is cryogenically focussed at -60 degrees C and then eluted by temperature programming. The procedure requires blending of soft samples, e.g. raisins, prunes, or oranges, and ultrasonic homogenization of hard samples, e.g. wheat, cocoa beans, corn, or nuts, with portions of water and ice so the final temperature of the food-water slurry is less than 1 degree C. A 20 g aliquot (4 g food) is then added to a cold headspace vial containing 4 g sodium sulfate. Losses of MB during a 3.5 min ultrasonic homogenization of wheat were 11% at 0.95 ppb and 4.4% at 4.8 ppb. For flour, cocoa, and finely divided spices, which do not require blending, 4 g is added to the cold headspace vial containing 16 mL cold water and 4 g sodium sulfate. Studies show that comminution of wheat or peanuts must be carried out to release MB trapped within the food so the headspace equilibrium can be attained in 1 h as well as to obtain homogeneous samples and representative sampling.

2526734,"The O-glycosylation of leukosialin, a major sialoglycoprotein found on leukocytes, has been studied in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562. The appearance of its O-linked chains has been followed in pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine by immunoprecipitation with an anti-peptide antiserum as well as with a lectin from Salvia sclarea seeds (SSA) specific for GalNAc-Ser/Thr and the peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin (PNA) which recognizes Gal beta 1----3GalNAc-Ser/Thr structures. An O-glycan-free precursor was converted into the fully O-glycosylated mature form within the 10-min labeling period and no intermediates carrying only GalNAc-Ser/Thr structures could be detected. The ionophore monensin was used in order to slow down intracellular traffic and thus O-glycan synthesis. The drug partly inhibited the transport from rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) to the Golgi and also the cell-surface expression of leukosialin. It was found to have a marked effect on the synthesis of O-linked carbohydrate structures of leukosialin since the amount of O-glycans containing only GalNAc or NeuNAc alpha 2----6GalNAc was significantly increased after monensin treatment. Under these conditions the biosynthesis of the N-glycan on leukosialin was completely arrested in an endoglycosidase-H-sensitive step of processing, whereas the O-glycans already contained galactose and sialic acid although at a reduced level. On the other hand, the small amounts of leukosialin expressed on the cell surface of monensin-treated cells carried the same glycans as those remaining blocked inside the cell. In addition, immunocytochemical studies using SSA and PNA on untreated K562 cells suggested the absence of detectable amounts of GalNAc-Ser/Thr-bearing glycoproteins in the RER as well as in the Golgi. In contrast Gal beta 1----3GalNAc structures could be detected on intracellular membranes which were tentatively identified as the cis-Golgi. Together these results lead us to the following conclusions: N-glycan transfer occurs in the RER before the initiation of O-glycans which takes place at the entrance of the protein into the Golgi; further elongation of O-glycans with galactose and sialic acid follows very rapidly, probably before the final processing of N-glycans to complex-type structures.",European journal of biochemistry,"['D015703', 'D001692', 'D002460', 'D002850', 'D004591', 'D004721', 'D006026', 'D006031', 'D006056', 'D006801', 'D037102', 'D004915', 'D051917', 'D008854', 'D008985', 'D009844', 'D011134', 'D012795']","['Antigens, CD', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Glycosylation', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Humans', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukosialin', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monensin', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Polysaccharides', 'Sialoglycoproteins']",O-glycosylation of leukosialin in K562 cells.

Emission intensity was not in a linear relationship with AFB1 level in the medium and was higher than at a corresponding concentration of AFB1 standard solution.

Twelve raw and roasted peanut and corn portions containing various concentrations of natural aflatoxins and supplemented when appropriate with aflatoxin B1 were distributed to participating laboratories for testing. The assay is based on competition between an enzyme-conjugated aflatoxin B1 and (free) aflatoxins in the test sample for aflatoxin-specific antibodies coated onto interior surfaces of microtiter wells. After a wash step to remove all unbound aflatoxins, a substrate added to each well is catalyzed from a colorless to a blue solution by any bound enzyme-conjugated aflatoxin B1 present. The intensity of the color decreases as the amount of free aflatoxin B1 in the test portion increases.

3417591,"A gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) method for determining daminozide in high protein products has been developed. Daminozide is hydrolyzed in the presence of a strong base to form unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) which is then distilled from the food matrix. A stable derivative is formed by reacting UDMH with salicyladehyde to form salicyaldehyde dimethylhydrazone. This derivative is separated and quantitated by GC/MS using selected ion monitoring (SIM) of key ions in the fragmentation pattern: m/z 164 (molecular ion of hydrazone) and m/z 120 (C7H6ON). An internal standard, 4-nitroanisole, is monitored at m/z 153 (molecular ion) and m/z 123 (C6H5O2N). The limit of detection is 0.01 ppm daminozide in a 50 g sample; however, because of variation at low levels, the limit of quantitation is 0.1 ppm. Recoveries are 90% or greater from peanuts and peanut butter spiked at the 0.1-2 ppm level. Reproducibility of the method depends on the food matrix and is 26% RSD in the worst case.

A modified minicolumn cleanup is used for sample preparation, and a preliminary estimation of aflatoxin content by minicolumn can be made so that highly contaminated samples can be diluted before LC analysis. The use of the simple, quick minicolumn cleanup eliminates the need for further column or cartridge cleanup, thus greatly reducing sample preparation time.

Purification steps include fractionation with protamine sulfate and ammonium sulfate followed by column chromatography on Bio-Gel and DEAE-cellulose; synthetase purified over 300-fold is obtained. The enzyme has a molecular weight estimated to be approximately 250,000 and a broad pH optimum with maximal activity at approximately pH 7.5. Maximal rates of activity are obtained with NH+4 (Km = 3.7 mM) as the amide donor and the enzyme is highly specific for 4-methylene-L-glutamic acid (Km = 2.7 mM) as the amide acceptor. Product identification and stoichiometric studies establish the reaction catalyzed to be: 4-methyleneglutamic acid + NH4+ + ATP Mg2+----4-methyleneglutamine + AMP + PPi. PPi accumulates only when F- is added to inhibit pyrophosphatase activity present in synthetase preparations. This enzymatic activity is completely insensitive to the glutamine synthetase inhibitors, tabtoxinine-beta-lactam and F-, and is only partially inhibited by methionine sulfoximine.

Protein quality ratings based on chemical score were variable. Both the chemical score and predicted first-limiting amino acid for a given protein often differed with data source and choice of reference pattern. Some of the predictions contradicted those previously validated by bioassays. The variability in protein quality ratings was reduced somewhat by expressing the data as essential amino acid indices. But this also reduced the degree of difference in protein quality among the various proteins. Although the amino acid profile of food proteins provides an important perspective on their nutritive value, it appears that the imprecision and uncertain accuracy of routine hydrolysis and analytical procedures confound the use of amino acid data for regulating protein quality.

The former method combines the speed and simplicity of the Holaday extraction and cleanup with the sensitivity of the minicolumn originally described by Velasco. The combination method has been approved by the AOAC and the AACC for determining aflatoxin in corn. The Holaday method was modified by substituting toluene for benzene in the solvent partition, and methylene chloride for chloroform in the minicolumn development to eliminate use of hazardous solvents. The neutral alumina in the Holaday minicolumn was changed from activity V to activity III to provide a more stable column. At aflatoxin levels in raw peanuts of 13-20 ng/g, the presence of aflatoxin was missed by the modified Holaday method in 4 analyses (3 laboratories) of 42 reported.

84852,"The major environmental problem associated with the use of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH, lindane) has been the appearance of the more oncogenic alpha- and beta- isomers as terminal residues in nature. To account for these residues it was suggested that gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane had been bioisomerized to the more stable alpha- and beta- isomers. In this study the effect of dose and duration of treatment on the proposed bioisomerization of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane in the rat was investigated. Weanling female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups receiving Purina Lab Chow fortified with 0, 130, 215, or 350 ppm gamma-HCH. Six animals from each group were sacrificed after 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks of treatment. Twenty-four hours prior to sacrifice all rats received a single oral dose of gamma-HCH in peanut oil. There were no significant differences in food consumption or body weights, and no deaths occurred throughout the study. The in vitro dechlorinase activity of the treated rats was significantly higher after 1, 4, and 24 weeks of treatment. Except at 4 weeks after treatment began, the liver/body weight ratios of the rats fed diets containing 350 ppm and 215 ppm lindane were significantly greater than the controls; while those receiving 130 ppm lindane were significantly greater than the controls after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment. No beta-HCH was detected in any of the samples analyzed throughout the study. The levels of alpha-HCH found in the adipose tissue after 24 weeks of treatment could be accounted for by trace contamination of the lindane used in this study.

31767,"Cottonseeds contain protein with desirable food functional and nutritional properties. Storage globulins make up most of the protein stored in cottonseed and can be separated into five fractions by gel filtration chromatography. Each fraction is distinguishable from the other by its amino acid and polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic properties. Proteins of cottonseed contribute greatly to the functional properties of emulsions, co-isolates, and texturized derivatives. For example, increasing the amount of high protein cottonseed flour in wheat suspensions from 2% to 10% improved the capacity (54-97 ml of oil) and viscosity (5,000-100,000+ cps) of emulsions. The 10% suspension formed emulsions with increasing oil capacity (84-100 ml) and viscosity (28,000-100,000+ cps) as the pH was adjusted from 4.5 to 9.5. Consistencies of the products ranged from that of salad dressing (low percent suspensions, or acid pH) to that of mayonnaise (high percent, or basic pH). These data were utilized to derive a multiple regression model to predict optimum use of cottonseed proteins in emulsions of varying consistencies. A coprecipitated isolate containing greater than 94% protein was prepared from a blend of cottonseed and peanut flours. Amino acid content of the co-isolate reflected that of the protein in the two flours of the composite. The co-isolate has lower gossypol level and improved color and functional properties than a cottonseed protein isolate. Storage protein isolate of cottonseed suspended in aqueous solution and heated with constant stirring forms a texturized product; the quality of the product depends on heat, pH, salt, and the quantity of nonstorage proteins.

5064985,"Mellein and 4-hydroxymellein are isocoumarin compounds produced by Aspergillus ochraceus Wilhelm. They are structurally similar to the dihydroisocoumarin moiety of ochratoxin A, a toxic metabolite of the same fungus, and they possibly have similar biological properties. Production of mellein and 4-hydroxymellein on synthetic media and natural solid substrates was determined. Several carbon and nitrogen sources supported production of these metabolites in stationary culture. Additional zinc and molybdenum increased production of both metabolites in stationary culture, but were not required for maximum production in shaken culture. Mellein and 4-hydroxymellein were produced on yellow corn, but neither was produced on wheat, peanuts, or soybeans.",Applied microbiology,"['D000704', 'D010367', 'D001230', 'D050260', 'D002855', 'D003374', 'D003470', 'D005374', 'D005971', 'D008982', 'D009584', 'D009793', 'D013025', 'D013053', 'D013395', 'D013997', 'D014131', 'D014908', 'D014466', 'D003313', 'D015032']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Arachis', 'Aspergillus', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Coumarins', 'Culture Media', 'Filtration', 'Glutamates', 'Molybdenum', 'Nitrogen', 'Ochratoxins', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Sucrose', 'Time Factors', 'Trace Elements', 'Triticum', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Zea mays', 'Zinc']",Mellein and 4-hydroxymellein production by Aspergillus ochraceus Wilhelm.,"[None, None, 'Q000254', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000494', 'Q000378', 'Q000096', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000494']","[None, None, 'growth & development', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', 'biosynthesis', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5064985,1972

It also grows on shredded wheat, potatoes, and laboratory culture media such as wort, potato dextrose, and Sabouraud agars, and synthesizes aflatoxin on these substrates. Thin-layer chromatograms of the chloroform-soluble toxin produced by the mold when grown on shredded wheat show fluorescent bands with R(F) values identical with those of the fractions B(1), B(2), G(1), and G(2) of the toxin produced by Aspergillus flavus.
