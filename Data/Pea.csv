35347716,"Fermentation of eight vegetables was studied as an alternative for reclamation of surplus volumes. Fermentation performance was predicted by comparing the amounts of acid that could be produced from the intrinsic sugar content with that buffered by the fresh vegetable matrices prior to reaching an inhibitory pH for fermentative microbes (3.30). Native fermentations were brined with 345.0 mM sodium chloride, 40.0 mM calcium chloride, 6.0 mM potassium sorbate, and vinegar to adjust the initial pH to 4.70. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis, pH, and carbon dioxide measurements and spiral plating on selective media were employed to monitor the progress of fermentations. The average colony counts for yeast and/or molds and Enterobacteriaceae declined to undetectable levels from 3.6 ± 1.5 log CFU/ml within 7 days of fermentation. The fermentation of sugars produced lactic, acetic, succinic, and/or malic acids, and ethanol. As predicted, the fermentation of vegetables with low sugar content, such as broccoli, green leaf lettuce, and green pea proceeded to completion. The fermentation of vegetables with a moderate sugar content, such as green bell pepper, red ripened tomato, and green bean were incomplete at pH 3.1 ± 0.2. The fermentation of high sugar vegetables including sweet potato and corn were expected and observed to be incomplete. It is concluded that the intrinsic sugar content and buffer capacity of surplus vegetables are relevant parameters in obtaining complete fermentations. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Vegetables are the second most wasted commodity in the United States and a substantial constituent of the global food waste. Development of fermentation to reclaim surplus vegetables from farms, grocery stores, and farmer's markets offers opportunities to ameliorate economic losses and environmental impact and add value to waste. The research described here suggests that a fraction of vegetables could be fermented in cover brines while others, with high sugar content, need specialized handling. Evidently, optimization of vegetable fermentation with starter cultures and added buffers represent an opportunity to stimulate complete bioconversions useful for reclaiming surplus volumes.",Journal of food science,[],[],Vegetable fermentations brined with low salt for reclaiming food waste.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35347716,2022

35243353,"Flubendiamide (FBD) is the first commercially available phthalic acid diamide that targets ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in insects, which play a major role in lepidoptera control. However, excessive use of FBD can influence the quality of treated products leading to toxic effects on human health. The availability of rapid and convenient methods for evaluating FBD amount in the environment is necessary. Therefore, analytical methods were developed for the determination of residues of FBD and its metabolite desiodo in different food matrices like tomato, cabbage, pigeon pea, apple, chilli and rice. The current review carries forward methods for FBD residues analysis in foods by using several chromatographic techniques including sample preparation steps. The comparison between the different methods employed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of food quality and safety is also discussed. Liquid chromatography (LC) is the predominant analytical method for assessing the quality of foods treated with FBD. Studies related to LC coupled multichannel detector (Ultraviolet (UV), Mass spectrometry (MS)) are also applied to detect pesticide residues. Extraction and clean up steps are essential to obtain reliable results.

35080159,"Disulfoton, an organophosphorus pesticide, is used to control cotton, beet, potato, and other seedling period aphids, leaf moths, underground pests, etc., with internal absorption, killing, gastric poisoning, and fumigation. Disulfoton is a highly toxic organophosphate pesticide, which can inhibit cholinesterase activity, resulting in neurophysiological disorders by inhalation, feeding, and transdermal absorption. Disulfoton is difficult to degrade in the environment, which leads to enrichment in organisms and interference with endocrine. This compound is harmful to the ecological environment and human health. To ensure the quality and safety of food, it is important to develop a detection method for disulfoton and its metabolites in agricultural products.

34201792,"Pulse crop seed coats are a sustainable source of antioxidant polyphenols, but are typically treated as low-value products, partly because some polyphenols reduce iron bioavailability in humans. This study correlates antioxidant/iron chelation capabilities of diverse seed coat types from five major pulse crops (common bean, lentil, pea, chickpea and faba bean) with polyphenol composition using mass spectrometry. Untargeted metabolomics was used to identify key differences and a hierarchical analysis revealed that common beans had the most diverse polyphenol profiles among these pulse crops. The highest antioxidant capacities were found in seed coats of black bean and all tannin lentils, followed by maple pea, however, tannin lentils showed much lower iron chelation among these seed coats. Thus, tannin lentils are more desirable sources as natural antioxidants in food applications, whereas black bean and maple pea are more suitable sources for industrial applications. Regardless of pulse crop, proanthocyanidins were primary contributors to antioxidant capacity, and to a lesser extent, anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols, whereas glycosylated flavonols contributed minimally.

As food anti-microbials, the compounds will have to withstand the cooking process without changing to toxic compounds. With this Communication, we address the question of whether PEA and EAA are altered when heated to 73.9 °C or 93.3 °C. A combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was used to analyze solutions of PEA(-HCl) or EAA in beef broth or water. In addition, the anti-microbial activity of PEA-HCl and EAA was compared between heated and unheated samples at a range of concentrations. The gas chromatograms of PEA(-HCl) and EAA showed one peak at early retention times that did not differ between the heated and unheated samples. The mass spectra for PEA and EAA were near identical to those from a spectral database and did not show any differences between the heated and unheated samples.

Surface modification of nanoparticles may change nanoparticle-environment interaction, and therefore affects compounds in plants. In this research, uncoated and glucose-, levan-, and pullulan-coated cerium oxide nanoparticles were used for wheat and pea treatment during the growth. The aim was the screening of semi-volatile organic compounds from plants' shoots using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, a powerful separation technique allowing to reach unique separation resolution, and investigation of qualitative changes after the treatment with coated cerium oxide nanoparticles. The results were analyzed by the identification of individual peaks and fingerprint analysis by image processing. Wheat samples contained a higher number of semi-volatile organic compounds (108) compared to pea (77) but were less affected by the treatments with coated nanoparticles. The highest number of compounds was detected in wheat after the treatment with levan- and pullulan-coated nanoparticles, and in pea after treatment with levan-coated nanoparticles.

We found that protein recovery yield increased from 49.20% to 57.56% as the alkaline extraction pH increased from 8.5 to 9.5. However, increasing the extraction pH promoted the formation of protein aggregates which decreased the percent protein solubility although there was no influence on protein secondary structure. PPI extracted at pH 9.0 possessed the lowest beany flavor as revealed by the selected six beany flavor markers including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and pyrazine.

The aim of the present work was to study protein hydrolysis in a selection of different protein sources using the harmonized INFOGEST static protocol: three isolated proteins (collagen, zein, and whey protein) and five foods (sorghum flour, wheat bran cereals, peanuts, black beans, and pigeon peas). The proteins of all the substrates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC-MS/MS. Individual amino acid composition was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). EAA/NEAA (essential amino acids/ nonessential amino acids) ratios in the substrates from low to high were as follows: wheat bran cereals, peanuts, collagen, zein, whey protein, sorghum, pigeon peas, and black beans. The results revealed sorghum, whey protein, and zein as good sources of BCAA. In all substrates, no intact protein from the substrates was visually detected by SDS-PAGE after the intestinal phase of in vitro digestion with the INFOGEST protocol. However, digestion-resistant peptides were detected in all substrates after the intestinal digestion phase.

31991085,"Aphids are phloem-feeding insects known as major pests in agriculture that are able to transmit hundreds of plant viruses. The majority of these viruses, classified as noncirculative, are retained and transported on the inner surface of the cuticle of the needle-like mouthparts while the aphids move from plant to plant. Identification of receptors of viruses within insect vectors is a key challenge because they are promising targets for alternative control strategies. The acrostyle, an organ discovered earlier within the common food/salivary canal at the tip of aphid maxillary stylets, displays proteins at the cuticle-fluid interface, some of which are receptors of noncirculative viruses. To assess the presence of stylet- and acrostyle-specific proteins and identify putative receptors, we have developed a comprehensive comparative analysis of the proteomes of four cuticular anatomical structures of the pea aphid, stylets, antennae, legs, and wings. In addition, we performed systematic immunolabeling detection of the cuticular proteins identified by mass spectrometry in dissected stylets. We thereby establish the first proteome of stylets of an insect and determine the minimal repertoire of the cuticular proteins composing the acrostyle. Most importantly, we propose a short list of plant virus receptor candidates, among which RR-1 proteins are remarkably predominant.

For this reason, a modified QuEChERS combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS) method was investigated. The optimization of UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS separation and QuEChERS procedure was performed. Under optimum conditions, the excellent chromatographic performance of the whole separation was accomplished within 6.3 min analyzing time. Meanwhile, the recoveries ranged from 77.2% to 101.7%, while relative standard deviation (RSD) remained between 0.0% and 9.4%. The limit of detection (LOD, 0.50-1.00 µg/L) and the limit of quantification (LOQ, 1.65-3.30 µg/L) were lower than those permitted by legislation in food matrices, which demonstrated the high sensitivity and applicability of this efficient method. This validated method was also applied in a pilot study to analyze BAs in 81 wine samples from Hexi Corridor Region (Gansu Province, Northwest China), CAD, HEX, HIS, PEA, PUT, and TYR were detected to varying degrees in the samples. However, when compared with the existing standards, the BAs in all 81 wine samples did not exceed the prescribed limit value or toxic dose (2-40 mg/L). Moreover, a statistical approach was also conducted using Pearson correlation analysis, and to evaluate their concentrations in terms of wine parameters (storage time, grape variety, wine type, and basic physicochemical index). The results showed that, among the seven kinds of BAs, the concentration of HIS had a certain correlation with alcoholic degree and grape variety. In addition, the level of PEA had a certain correlation with the wine pH and wine storage time. It is worth noting that this seems to be the first report regarding the application of QuEChERS-UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the analysis of BAs in wine in this region.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Development and Application of a New QuEChERS Method in UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS to Detect Seven Biogenic Amines in Chinese Wines.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694278,2020
31655856,"Intestinal diamine oxidase (DAO) acts as a protective barrier against exogenous histamine. A deficit of DAO activity can lead to the appearance of histamine intolerance, a clinical condition that may be treated by a low-histamine diet and oral DAO supplementation to enhance intestinal histamine degradation. As sources of DAO, porcine kidneys and certain legume seedlings are suitable components for the formulation of a DAO supplement. The aim of this work was to develop a rapid and reliable methodology for the in vitro determination of DAO activity in food matrices based on an enzymatic assay coupled to UHPLC-FL. The proposed method showed a satisfactory linearity and sensitivity and provided a relative standard deviation lower than 3%, guaranteeing method precision, and a mean recovery greater than 99% both for lyophilized pea sprouts and porcine kidney protein extracts. A high specificity is a key attribute of this method due to the use of histamine as the reaction substrate and the direct quantification of its degradation. Moreover, the lack of interference of catalase and hydrogen peroxide is another advantage in comparison with previously published methods. Lyophilized pea sprouts showed the greatest histamine-degrading activity (0.40 ± 0.01 mU/mg), followed by porcine kidney protein extracts (0.23 ± 0.01 mU/mg) and commercial DAO supplements (0.09 ± 0.06 mU/mg).

Methionine and lysine were typically lower in plant-based proteins (1.0 ± 0.3 and 3.6 ± 0.6%) compared with animal-based proteins (2.5 ± 0.1 and 7.0 ± 0.6%) and muscle protein (2.0 and 7.8%, respectively). In conclusion, there are large differences in EAA contents and AA composition between various plant-based protein isolates.

30052442,"Grass pea, a protein-rich, high-yielding, and drought-tolerant legume, is used as food and livestock feed in several tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The abundant seed proteins of grass pea are salt-soluble globulins, which can be separated into vicilins and legumins. In many other legumes, the members of vicilin seed proteins have been identified as major allergens. However, very little information is available on the allergens of grass pea. In this study, we have identified an abundant 47 kDa protein from grass pea, which was recognized by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies from sera drawn from several peanut-allergic patients. The IgE-binding 47 kDa protein was partially purified by affinity chromatography on a Con-A sepharose column. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the 47 kDa grass pea protein revealed sequence homology to 47 kDa vicilin from pea and Len c 1 from lentil. Interestingly the grass pea vicilin was found to be susceptible to pepsin digestion in vitro. We have also isolated a cDNA encoding the grass pea 47 kDa vicilin (β-lathyrin), and the deduced amino acid sequence revealed extensive homology to several known allergens, including those from peanut and soybean. A homology model structure of the grass pea β-lathyrin, generated using the X-ray crystal structure of the soybean β-conglycinin β subunit as a template, revealed potential IgE-binding epitopes located on the surface of the molecule. The similarity in the three-dimensional structure and the conservation of the antigenic epitopes on the molecular surface of vicilin allergens explains the IgE-binding cross-reactivity.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000485', 'D010367', 'D005512', 'D006023', 'D006801', 'D007073', 'D027807', 'D027806', 'D013058', 'D010940', 'D055314']","['Allergens', 'Arachis', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Lathyrus', 'Lens Plant', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Plant Proteins', 'Seed Storage Proteins']","Identification and Characterization of β-Lathyrin, an Abundant Glycoprotein of Grass Pea ( Lathyrus sativus L.), as a Potential Allergen.","['Q000737', 'Q000235', 'Q000276', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'genetics', 'immunology', 'chemistry', None, 'immunology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30052442,2018

The quantification of naphthalene and its by-products were also recorded by Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC / MS) in soil and in the different plant parts (roots, stems, leaves and fruit). In our controlled laboratory studies, plants exposed to naphthalene were able to efficiently grow and maintain their content of chlorophyll and carotenoids comparatively to the control plants. However, the pollutant slightly increased the amounts of fatty acid peroxides and strongly those of malonyldialdehyde, the product of lipid peroxidation. The glutathione S transferase activity was also increased for all concentrations used especially in leaves. Chromatograms showed that naphthalene has fallen sharply in the soil or even disappeared for the highest concentration from the second to third week. Furthermore, the removal ratio of 67% of the pollutant from the soil was distributed between two metabolites (ion 47 and ion 59) in the leaves for this same concentration in only three weeks of cultivation.

In this study, we describe the sourcing of VR present in food based on chemical analysis of attribution signatures by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) combined with multivariate data analysis. Analytical data was acquired from seven different foods spiked with VR batches that were synthesized via six different routes in two separate laboratories. The synthesis products were spiked at a lethal dose into seven food matrices: water, orange juice, apple purée, baby food, pea purée, liquid eggs and hot dog. After acetonitrile sample extraction, the samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS operated in MRM mode. A multivariate statistical calibration model was built on the chemical attribution profiles from 118 VR spiked food samples. Using the model, an external test-set of the six synthesis routes employed for VR production was correctly identified with no observable major impact of the food matrices to the classification.

The newly produced PPI and PF fractions were processed into pasta-like sheets with varying protein to fiber ratios (100/0, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 and 50/50, respectively) using high temperature compression molding. We studied protein polymerization, molecular structure and protein-fiber interactions, as well as mechanical performance and cooking characteristics of processed PPI-PF blends. Bi-modal particle size distribution and chemical composition of the PPI and PF fractions influenced significantly the physicochemical properties of the pasta-like sheets. Polymerization was most pronounced for the 100 PPI, 90/10 and 80/20 PPI-PF samples as studied by SE-HPLC, and polymerization decreased with addition of the PF fraction. The mechanical properties, as strength and extensibility, were likewise the highest for the 100 PPI and 90/10 PPI-PF blends, while the E-modulus was similar for all the studied blends (around 38 MPa). The extensibility decreased with the increasing amount of PF in the blend. The highest amounts of β-sheets were found in the pasta-like sheets with high amounts of PPI (100, 90 and 80%), by FT-IR. An increase in PF fraction in the blend, resulted into the high amounts of unordered structures as observed by FT-IR, as well as in an increase in the molecular scattering distances observed by SAXS. The water uptake increased and cooking loss decreased with increased proportions of the PF fraction, and the consistency of 10 min cooked pasta-like sheets were alike al dente texture. The new knowledge obtained in this study on the use of extraction-fractionation method to produce novel PPI and PF fractions for developing innovative high nutritious food can be of a great importance.

The production of ""mixed"" thermal aggregates would involve both the formation of new disulfide bonds and noncovalent interactions between the denatured βlg and Glob subunits. The majority of ""mixed"" soluble aggregates displayed higher molecular weight and smaller diameter than those for Glob heated in isolation.

It is crucial to establish a rapid as well as reliable detection methodology for β-ODAP content in various Lathyrus plants. Currently available HPLC based methods involve multi-step derivatization of the sample. To overcome this, we have developed β-ODAP analysis method by HPLC without any prior derivatization. This method is statistically significant in the range of 2 to 100μg/ml and exhibited linear response with r2 > 0.99. Limit of detection and quantitation of the later method was determined to be 5.56 μg/ml and 16.86 μg/ml, respectively. In addition to this, a TLC based method has also been developed. The limit of detection of β-ODAP is 0.6μg and for its substrate, L-1,2-diaminopropionic acid is 5μg.

There is a need to examine Br pathways in plants and evaluate the factors important for Br accumulation in a plant. In the present work, the effects of different Br compounds on an uptake of Br by two plant species (wheat and pea) that tolerate Br differently (pea is more sensitive to Br compared with wheat) have been studied. The growth medium was spiked with either KBr or NaBr at concentrations 0, 10, 50 and 100 mg/L. Elemental analysis of the plants was performed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and ICP-MS analytical techniques after leaching of the samples with tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide at mild temperature (60 °C). The experimental results have shown that wheat and pea seedlings can accumulate rather large amounts of Br. An increase of Br concentration in a plant was not always directly proportional to the variations in the Br concentration in the growth medium. In wheat, the greater part of Br was accumulated during first 7 days. In pea, the uptake of Br lasted until the end of the experiment. Certain differences in the ability of plants to accumulate Br were observed when the plants were grown in a medium spiked with different Br compounds. In most cases, Br accumulation was higher in the leaves of the plants grown in the medium spiked with KBr.

The endocannabinoids (eCBs, N-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA; 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2AG) are endogenous neuromodulators that regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release in neurons throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. While substantial information is known about the eCBs, less is known about a number of endocannabinoid-like metabolites (eCBLs, e.g., N-palmitoylethanolamine, PEA; N-oleoylethanolamine, OEA). We report the comparative effects of parathion and chlorpyrifos on AChE and enzymes responsible for inactivation of the eCBs, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), and changes in the eCBs AEA and 2AG and eCBLs PEA and OEA, in rat striatum. Adult, male rats were treated with vehicle (peanut oil, 2 ml/kg, sc), parathion (27 mg/kg) or chlorpyrifos (280 mg/kg) 6-7 days after surgical implantation of microdialysis cannulae into the right striatum, followed by microdialysis two or four days later. Additional rats were similarly treated and sacrificed for evaluation of tissue levels of eCBs and eCBLs. Dialysates and tissue extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. AChE and FAAH were extensively inhibited at both time-points (85-96%), while MAGL activity was significantly but lesser affected (37-62% inhibition) by parathion and chlorpyrifos. Signs of toxicity were noted only in parathion-treated rats. In general, chlorpyrifos increased eCB levels while parathion had no or lesser effects. Early changes in extracellular AEA, 2AG and PEA levels were significantly different between parathion and chlorpyrifos exposures.

The adsorbent (Fe3O4@SiO2@GO-PEA) was then used in a magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of six organophosphorous pesticides (OPPs) including methyl parathion, fenitrothion, methidathion, ethion, methyl azinphos and coumaphos prior to gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus detection (GC-NPD). The fabricated adsorbent combines the advantages of superior adsorption capability of modified GO and magnetic separability of magnetite microparticles to provide high adsorption capacity, and easy isolation from sample solutions. The main experimental parameters affecting the extraction recovery of OPPs including extraction time, pH, adsorbent dosage, salt concentration, and desorption conditions were investigated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, linear responses were obtained in the concentration range of 0.06-200μgL(-1) with the determination coefficients (R(2)) between 0.9945 and 0.9996.

It has been previously shown that rust (Uromyces pisi) infection can be reduced in pea (Pisum sativum) by exogenous applications of systemic acquired resistance elicitors such as BTH and BABA. This protection is known to be related with the induction of the phenolic pathway but the particular metabolites involved have not been determined yet. In this work, we tackled the changes induced in phytoalexin content by BTH and BABA treatments in the context of the resistance responses to pea rust. Detailed analysis through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed qualitative and quantitative differences in the content, as well as in the distribution of phytoalexins. Thus, following BTH treatment, we observed an increase in scopoletin, pisatin and medicarpin contents in all, excreted, soluble and cell wall-bound fraction. This suggests fungal growth impairment by both direct toxic effect as well as plant cell wall reinforcement. The response mediated by BTH was genotype-dependent, since coumarin accumulation was observed only in the resistant genotype whereas treatment by BABA primed phytoalexin accumulation in both genotypes equally. Exogenous application to the leaves of scopoletin, medicarpin and pisatin lead to a reduction of the different fungal growth stages, confirming a role for these phytoalexins in BTH- and BABA-induced resistance against U. pisi hampering pre- and postpenetration fungal stages.",Planta,"['D000613', 'D000935', 'D001487', 'D018532', 'D010935', 'D012717']","['Aminobutyrates', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Basidiomycota', 'Peas', 'Plant Diseases', 'Sesquiterpenes']",BTH and BABA induce resistance in pea against rust (Uromyces pisi) involving differential phytoalexin accumulation.,"['Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000382', 'Q000378']","['pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'microbiology', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26059606,2016

Volatile compounds were measured with static-headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (SH-GC-MS); biogenic amine measurements were carried out with a newly developed method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). In total, 56 CNS strains from five different species were used, namely Staphylococcus carnosus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus equorum, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus xylosus. With respect to the production of volatile compounds, the leucine-derived 3-methyl butanol was produced over time by most CNS strains, up to 52 μM for S. xylosus W1-1 after 48 h of incubation. The average production by strains of S. xylosus was significantly higher than for strains of S. carnosus, whereas strains of S. epidermidis turned out to be poor producers. Yet, differences between species were blurred to a large degree because of the high strain variability. A few strains also produced 3-methyl butanal on top of the amount that was already present in the medium background, although most CNS led to a decrease of this compound. Concerning biogenic amines, the average total concentrations per species remained below 100 μM after 48 h of incubation. The most abundant variant was 2-phenylethylamine (PEA), especially within S. carnosus (average of 65 μM after 48 h of incubation).

25956648,"The present work report the unusual uranium uptake by foodstuff, especially those rich in carbohydrates like rice when they are cooked in water, contaminated with uranium. The major staple diet in South Asia, rice, was chosen to study its interaction with UO2(2+), the active uranium species in water, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Highest uptake limit was checked by cooking rice at very high uranium concentration and it was found to be good scavenger of uranium. To gain insight into the mechanism of uptake, direct interaction of UO2(2+) with monosaccharides was also studied, using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry taking mannose as a model. The studies have been done with dissolved uranium salt, uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UO2(NO3)2·6H2O), as well as the leachate of a stable oxide of uranium, UO2(s), both of which exist as UO2(2+) in water. Among the eight different rice varieties investigated, Karnataka Ponni showed the maximum uranium uptake whereas unpolished Basmati rice showed the minimum. Interaction with other foodstuffs (potato, carrot, peas, kidney beans and lentils) with and without NaCl affected the extent of chemical interaction but was not consistent with the carbohydrate content. Uranium interaction with D-mannose monitored through ESI-MS, under optimized instrumental parameters, identified the peaks corresponding to uranyl adduct with mannose monomer, dimer and trimer and the species were confirmed by MS/MS studies.

Malachite green (4-[(4-dimethylaminophenyl) phenyl-methyl]-N,N-dimethylaniline) is a hazardous dye that is used to treat fungal and protozoan infections in fish and is a common adulterant (coloring agent) in green pea and other green vegetables because of its green color. In the present work, malachite green was determined in various foodstuffs using a direct injection technique on an RP C18 column with isocratic elution. The optimum mobile phase consisted of 0.15 M sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 6% pentanol buffered at pH 5. Detection was carried out at 620 nm. Malachite green was eluted in 9.2 min without any interference caused by endogenous compounds. Linearities (r > 0.9999), intraday and interday precision (RSD less than 1.00%) in micellar media, and robustness were studied for method validation. LOD and LOQ were 0.10 and 0.25 ppm, respectively.

25540007,"The effect of a typical polyaromatic hydrocarbon, naphthalene (Naph), on photosystem 2 (PS-2) photochemical activity in thylakoid membrane preparations and 20-day-old pea leaves was studied. Samples were incubated in water in the presence of Naph (0.078, 0.21, and 0.78 mM) for 0.5-24 h under white light illumination (15 μmol photons·m(-2)·s(-1)). The PS-2 activity was determined by studying fast and delayed chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence. Incubation of samples in water solutions at Naph concentrations of 0.21 and 0.78 mM led to a decrease in the maximum PS-2 quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm), noticeable changes in the polyphasic induction kinetics of fluorescence (OJIP), and a decrease in the amplitudes of the fast and slow components of delayed fluorescence of Chl a. The rate of release of electrolytes from leaves that were preliminarily incubated with Naph (0.21 mM) was also increased. Significant decrease in the fluorescence parameters in thylakoid membrane preparations was observed at Naph concentration of 0.03 mM and 12-min exposure of the samples. Chlorophyll (a and b) and carotenoid content (mg per gram wet mass) was insignificantly changed. The quantum yields of electron transfer from QA to QB (φET2o) and also to the PS-1 acceptors (φRE1o) were reduced. These results are explained by the increase in the number of QB-non-reducing centers of PS-2, which increased with increasing Naph concentration and exposure time of leaves in Naph solution. The suppression of PS-2 activity was partly abolished in the presence of the electron donor sodium ascorbate. Based on these results, it is suggested that Naph distorts cell membrane intactness and acts mainly on the PS-2 acceptor and to a lesser degree on the PS-2 donor side.",Biochemistry.

There is a need to deplete the vicilins from maize embryo extracts for enhanced proteomics analysis. We here reported a chloroform-assisted phenol extraction (CAPE) method for vicilin depletion. By CAPE, maize embryo proteins were first extracted in an aqueous buffer, denatured by chloroform and then subjected to phenol extraction. We found that CAPE can effectively deplete the vicilins from maize embryo extract, allowing the detection of low-abundance proteins that were masked by vicilins in 2-DE gel. The novelty of CAPE is that it selectively depletes abundant storage proteins from embryo extracts of both monocot (maize) and dicot (soybean and pea) seeds, whereas other embryo proteins were not depleted. CAPE can significantly improve proteome profiling of embryos and extends the application of chloroform and phenol extraction in plant proteomics.

25038681,"""Fava Santorinis"", is a protected designation of origin (PDO) yellow split pea species growing only in the island of Santorini in Greece. Due to its nutritional quality and taste, it has gained a high monetary value. Thus, it is prone to adulteration with other yellow split peas. In order to discriminate ""Fava Santorinis"" from other yellow split peas, four classification methods utilising rare earth elements (REEs) measured through inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are studied. The four classification processes are orthogonal projection analysis (OPA), Mahalanobis distance (MD), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and k nearest neighbours (KNN). Since it is known that trace elements are often useful to determine geographical origin of food products, we further quantitated for trace elements using ICP-MS. Presented in this paper are results using the four classification processes based on the fusion of the REEs data with the trace element data. Overall, the OPA method was found to perform best with up to 100% accuracy using the fused data.

MPs are commonly studied pyrazines in food science due to their contribution of aroma and flavor to numerous vegetables such as peas and asparagus. They are described as highly odorous compounds with a very low olfactory threshold. The grape varietals that exhibit green or herbaceous aromas that are characteristic of MPs are predominantly Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc, but include others. The most extensively studied MPs include 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine, 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine, and 3-sec-butyl-2-methoxypyrazine. It outlines the significance of methoxypyrazines in grapes, musts, and wines in terms of the concentrations that are capable of contributing their sensory characteristics to wines. This review discusses methods for analyzing MPs including gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (one or two dimension) and high-performance liquid chromatography, the appropriate extraction techniques, and the efficacy of these methods. Additionally, this review explores factors that affect pyrazine content of grapes, must, and wines, such as the effects of different viticultural practices, effects of light exposure and grape maturation, climate, soil, the multi-colored Asian lady beetle and the effects of different vinification processes.

23686467,"Recent studies on animal alarm signaling have shown that alarm calls generally are not uniform, but may vary depending on the type and intensity of threat. While alarm call variability has been studied intensively in birds and mammals, little is known about such variation in insects. We investigated variability in alarm signaling in aphids, group-living insect herbivores. Under attack, aphids release droplets containing a volatile alarm pheromone, (E)-β-farnesene (EBF), that induces specific escape behavior in conspecifics. We used a handheld gas chromatograph (zNose™), which allows real-time volatile analysis, to measure EBF emission by pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, under attack from different predators, lacewing or ladybird larvae. We demonstrate that aphid alarm signaling is affected by the predator species attacking. Ladybirds generally elicited smaller EBF emission peaks and consumed aphids more quickly, resulting in lower total EBF emission compared to lacewing attacks. In 52 % of the replicates with lacewings and 23 % with ladybirds, no EBF was detectable in the headspace, although aphids secreted cornicle droplets after attack. We, therefore, examined EBF amounts contained in these droplets and the aphid body. While all aphid bodies always contained EBF, many secreted droplets did not. Our experiments show that alarm signaling in insects can be variable, and both the attacker as well as the attacked may affect alarm signal variation. While underlying mechanisms of such variation in aphid-predator interactions need to be investigated in more detail, we argue that at least part of this variation may be adaptive for the predator and the aphid.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000819', 'D000818', 'D001042', 'D002849', 'D001517', 'D020387', 'D007313', 'D007814', 'D010675', 'D012717']","['Animal Communication', 'Animals', 'Aphids', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Coleoptera', 'Food Chain', 'Insecta', 'Larva', 'Pheromones', 'Sesquiterpenes']",Modulation of aphid alarm pheromone emission of pea aphid prey by predators.,"[None, None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000254', None, 'Q000254', 'Q000254', 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'physiology', None, 'growth & development', None, 'growth & development', 'growth & development', 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686467,2013

Half (9 of 17) of the samples of canned fish in oil collected in April 2010 contained cyclo-diBA with an average concentration of 1025 μg/kg and a maximum of 1980 μg/kg. In September 2012, cyclo-diBA was detectable (>25 μg/kg) in merely 13 from 44 such products; the average concentration in these was 807 μg/kg and the maximum now reached 2640 μg/kg. Fish in brine contained far less cyclo-diBA. The majority of the canned meat products contained cyclo-diBA at a mean concentration of 477 μg/kg and a maximum of 1050 μg/kg. All prepared meals, such as ravioli or soups, contained cyclo-diBA, with a mean at 287 μg/kg. In canned tomatoes, peas and other vegetables in water or fruits in syrup, no cyclo-diBA was detected (<25 μg/kg). Since no experimental toxicity data are available except for its cytotoxicity, an in silico hazard profiling was performed. Cyclo-diBA seems to be stable and of low reactivity. There is indication for considerable oral bioavailability and for the potential to accumulate in the human body. Cyclo-diBA can be metabolized into cyclic and acyclic compounds. Based on SAR assessment for cyclo-diBA and read-across from BADGE to linear cyclo-diBA metabolites, genotoxic effects are improbable. Specific binding of cyclo-diBA to nuclear receptors, such as ERβ, can be predicted, indicating a potential endocrine-disrupting potency. The limit by the EFSA guidelines of 50 μg/person/d for compounds shown not to be genotoxic as well as the TTC-based Cramer structural class III value of 90 μg/person/d could be exceeded several fold by high consumers of canned fish in oil with high brand loyalty.

Crantz), focusing on the influence of environmental factors on nutritional quality parameters. Field experiments with precrop barley were conducted in Norway in the growing seasons 2007, 2008, and 2009. Trials were fully randomized with two levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization, 0 and 120 kg total N ha(-1), and two levels of sulfur (S) fertilization, 0 and 20 kg total S ha(-1). Weather conditions, that is, temperature and precipitation, were recorded. Additional experiments were performed in the years 2008 and 2009 to evaluate the effects of replacing precrop barley with precrop pea. Seed oil content was measured by near-infrared transmittance, and crude oil compositions of fatty acids, phytosterols, tocopherols, and phospholipids were analyzed by chromatography and mass spectrometry. Results showed significant seasonal variations in seed oil content and oil composition of fatty acids, tocopherols, phytosterols, and phospholipids that to a great extent could be explained by the variations in weather conditions. Furthermore, significant effects of N fertilization were observed. Seed oil content decreased at the highest level of N fertilization, whereas the oil concentrations of α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), erucic acid (22:1n-9), tocopherols, and campesterol increased. Pea compared to barley as precrop also increased the 18:3n-3 content of oil. S fertilization had little impact on oil composition, but an increase in tocopherols and a decrease in brassicasterol were observed. In conclusion, organically grown camelina seems to be well suited for the production of edible oil.

23330715,"Starch has unique physicochemical characteristics among food carbohydrates. Starch contributes to the physicochemical attributes of food products made from roots, legumes, cereals, and fruits. It occurs naturally as distinct particles, called granules. Most starch granules are a mixture of 2 sugar polymers: a highly branched polysaccharide named amylopectin and a basically linear polysaccharide named amylose. The starch contained in food products undergoes changes during processing, which causes changes in the starch molecular weight and amylose to amylopectin ratio. The objective of this study was to develop a new, simple, 1-step, and accurate method for simultaneous determination of amylose and amylopectin ratio as well as weight-averaged molecular weights of starch in food products. Starch from bread flour, canned peas, corn flake cereal, snack crackers, canned kidney beans, pasta, potato chips, and white bread was extracted by dissolving in KOH, urea, and precipitation with ethanol. Starch samples were solubilized and analyzed on a high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) system. To verify the identity of the peaks, fractions were collected and soluble starch and beta-glucan assays were performed additional to gas chromatography analysis. We found that all the fractions contain only glucose and soluble starch assay is correlated to the HPSEC fractionation.

Protein samples enriched in chickpea legumin and vicilin were obtained by anion exchange chromatography, and were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. IgE-immunoassays of globulin fractions from chickpeas revealed that vicilin (50 kDa) and the basic subunit of legumin (20 kDa) were bound by IgE from patient sera. Pea and lentil protein extracts strongly inhibited the IgE binding to chickpea globulin. We speculate that vicilin and the basic subunit of legumin are major chickpea allergens.

Epidemiological studies have provided convincing evidence that natural dietary compounds, which humans consume as food, possess many biological activities, including chemopreventative activities against various chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we investigated the effect of 50% ethanol extracts of pigeon pea, as well as its major component, cyanidin-3-monoglucoside, an anthocyanin, on DNA damage, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and free radical scavenging capacity in hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-treated RAW264.7 macrophages. High-pressure liquid chromatography results indicated that 2 mg of the 50% ethanol extracts of pigeon pea contained 45 μg of cyanidin-3-monoglucoside. A comet assay indicated that 50% ethanol extracts of pigeon pea (2 mg mL(-1)) and of cyanidin-3-monoglucoside (10 μM) protected RAW264.7 cells from DNA damage induced by a 24 h H(2)O(2) treatment. These results can be attributed to the prevention of reduction in antioxidant enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation in H(2)O(2)-treated murine RAW264.7 macrophages by the 50% ethanol extracts of pigeon pea. Moreover, as there is an active interplay between oxidative stress and inflammation, we also evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of the 50% ethanol extracts of pigeon pea and cyanidin-3-monoglucoside in lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW264.7 macrophages. We found that the 50% ethanol extracts of pigeon pea and of cyanidin-3-monoglucoside suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in these macrophages.

After the re-absorption correction, the solar-induced fluorescence under different Cu stress was obtained, and a positive relationship was found between the height of far RED fluorescence (FRF) and the copper contents in leaves.",Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu,"['D001937', 'D002734', 'D003300', 'D018556', 'D005453', 'D018532', 'D018515', 'D013050', 'D014908']","['Brassica', 'Chlorophyll', 'Copper', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'Fluorescence', 'Peas', 'Plant Leaves', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Triticum']",[A novel method for extracting leaf-level solar-induced fluorescence of typical crops under Cu stress].,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000633', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'toxicity', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22827073,2015
22608116,"The simultaneous analysis of fat- and water-soluble vitamins from foods is a difficult task considering the wide range of chemical structures involved. In this work, a new procedure based on a sequential extraction and analysis of both types of vitamins is presented. The procedure couples several simple extraction steps to LC-MS/MS and LC-DAD in order to quantify the free vitamins contents in fresh-cut vegetables before and after a 10-days storage period. The developed method allows the correct quantification of vitamins C, B(1), B(2), B(3), B(5), B(6), B(9), E and provitamin A in ready-to-eat green leafy vegetable products including green lettuce, ruby red lettuce, watercress, swiss chard, lamb's lettuce, spearmint, spinach, wild rocket, pea leaves, mizuna, garden cress and red mustard. Using this optimized methodology, low LOQs were attained for the analyzed vitamins in less than 100 min, including extraction and vitamin analysis using 2 optimized procedures; good repeatability and linearity was achieved for all vitamins studied, while recoveries ranged from 83% to 105%. The most abundant free vitamins found in leafy vegetable products were vitamin C, provitamin A and vitamin E. The richest sample on vitamin C and provitamin A was pea leaves (154 mg/g fresh weight and 14.4 mg/100g fresh weight, respectively), whereas lamb's lettuce was the vegetable with the highest content on vitamin E (3.1 mg/100 g fresh weight).

22213812,"Peroxisomes, single-membrane-bounded organelles with essentially oxidative metabolism, are key in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Recently, the presence of nitric oxide (NO) described in peroxisomes opened the possibility of new cellular functions, as NO regulates diverse biological processes by directly modifying proteins. However, this mechanism has not yet been analysed in peroxisomes. This study assessed the presence of S-nitrosylation in pea-leaf peroxisomes, purified S-nitrosylated peroxisome proteins by immunoprecipitation, and identified the purified proteins by two different mass-spectrometry techniques (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight and two-dimensional nano-liquid chromatography coupled to ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry). Six peroxisomal proteins were identified as putative targets of S-nitrosylation involved in photorespiration, β-oxidation, and reactive oxygen species detoxification. The activity of three of these proteins (catalase, glycolate oxidase, and malate dehydrogenase) is inhibited by NO donors. NO metabolism/S-nitrosylation and peroxisomes were analysed under two different types of abiotic stress, i.e. cadmium and 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D). Both types of stress reduced NO production in pea plants, and an increase in S-nitrosylation was observed in pea extracts under 2,4-D treatment while no total changes were observed in peroxisomes. However, the S-nitrosylation levels of catalase and glycolate oxidase changed under cadmium and 2,4-D treatments, suggesting that this post-translational modification could be involved in the regulation of H(2)O(2) level under abiotic stress.",Journal of experimental botany,"['D015084', 'D000429', 'D000445', 'D002104', 'D002374', 'D008291', 'D009569', 'D020030', 'D018532', 'D020675', 'D010936', 'D018515', 'D010940', 'D011499', 'D040901', 'D017382', 'D026422', 'D013312']","['2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Aldehyde Oxidoreductases', 'Cadmium', 'Catalase', 'Malate Dehydrogenase', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Donors', 'Peas', 'Peroxisomes', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Proteins', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteomics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'S-Nitrosoglutathione', 'Stress, Physiological']",S-Nitrosylated proteins in pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaf peroxisomes: changes under abiotic stress.,"['Q000494', 'Q000378', 'Q000037', 'Q000494', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000494', 'Q000201', 'Q000201', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000494', 'Q000502']","['pharmacology', 'metabolism', 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', 'enzymology', 'enzymology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', 'physiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22213812,2014

23572726,"Besan, the flour of Bengal gram (Cicer arietinum Linn), a legume, is a popular ingredient of many culinary dishes in India. Because of its high demand, its flour is often adulterated by that of other legumes, such as, Lathyrus sativus (lathyrus) or Pisum sativum (pea) by unscrupulous traders. There are chemical methods of paper chromatography and HPLC by which the adulteration with the flour of L. sativus can be established but they are sophisticated techniques. At present, there are no chemical methods by which the adulteration with the flour of P. sativum can be detected. Microscopy is a simple technique and has been used for detection of adulteration of a number of food grains. Microscopic observation of the flour of these three legumes showed that their seed testa macrosclereids are distinct in their shape and size. The macrosclereids of C. arietinum are longer with a mean length of 155.6 microns and are bent at one end. Those of either P. sativum or L. sativus are shorter with a mean length of 61.8 and 72 microns respectively, with flat ends and with a different morphology. The seed testa macrosclereids of other edible legumes also show differences in morphology. Thus, it was observed that microscopic observation of the besan flour for the macrosclereids of other legumes is a powerful but simple means by which detection of adulteration of besan with the flour of P. sativum or L. sativus or by other edible legumes can be made.

Parameters such as Fv/Fm, performance index (PI), and reaction centre to absorbance ratio (RC/ABS) were deduced using radial plots from fluorescence induction curves obtained with a plant efficiency analyser (PEA). To derive precise information on fluorescence induction kinetics, energy pipeline leaf models were plotted using biolyzer hp3 software. At 35 °C, there was no effect on photosynthetic efficiency, including the oxygen-evolving complex, and the donor side of PSII remained active. At 40 °C, activity was reduced by 14%, while at 45 °C, a K intermediate step was observed, indicating irreversible damage to the oxygen-evolving complex.

The permeate was freeze-dried and fractionated on a cationic solid-phase extraction (SPE) column. All fractions were tested for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), renin, and calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase 1 (CaMPDE). With the exception of the first eluted fraction, inhibitory properties of the SPE fractions against CaMPDE (but not ACE and renin) were directly related to cationic character (residence time on the column). However, the fraction that eluted with 1% ammonium hydroxide (SPE 1%) had the highest peptide yield and was subsequently fractionated using two consecutive rounds of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to obtain three peaks with major peptides identified as IR, KF, and EF by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The three dipeptides showed weak inhibitory properties toward CaMPDE but strong inhibitions (IC50 values <25 mM) of ACE and renin.

20462810,"Endogenous ethanolamides (fatty acid amides), including arachidonyl ethanolamide (anandamide, AEA), oleoyl ethanolamide (OEA), and palmitoyl ethanolamide (PEA), are substrates of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). FAAH may play an important role for pain, anxiety/depression, and metabolic disorders. Ethanolamides are considered to be potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers to determine target engagement for FAAH inhibition by novel pharmaceutical agents. A highly selective, sensitive, and high-throughput liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for simultaneous quantitation of AEA, OEA, and PEA in human plasma. The method employed D(4)-AEA, D(4)-OEA, and (13)C(2)-PEA as ""surrogate analytes"" to establish the concentration-mass response relationship, i.e. a regression equation. The concentrations of AEA, OEA, and PEA were calculated based on the regression equations derived from the surrogate analytes. This approach made it possible to prepare calibration standard and quality control (QC) samples in plasma devoid of interferences from the endogenous analytes. The analytical methodology required 150 microL of human plasma that was processed via liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) using a 96-well plate format. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column using gradient elution, and the run time was 3 min. The method was fully validated and it demonstrated acceptable accuracy, precision, linearity, and specificity. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 0.1/0.5/0.5 ng/mL for AEA/OEA/PEA, which was sensitive enough to capture the basal plasma levels in healthy subjects. Bench-top stability in plasma, freeze-thaw stability in plasma, frozen long-term stability in plasma, autosampler stability, and stock solution stability all met acceptance criteria (%Bias within +/-12.0%). Characterization of stability in purchased/aged blood indicated that ethanolamides are subject to degradation mediated by intracellular membrane-bound FAAH, which has been shown to be inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). In the presence of PMSF, ethanolamide levels increased slightly over time, suggesting that blood cells release ethanolamides into plasma. Whole blood stability conducted in fresh blood immediately following collection revealed that there was significant elevation of ethanolamide concentrations (approximately 1.3-2.0-fold on ice and approximately 1.5-3.0-fold at room temperature by 2h), indicating that de novo synthesis and release from blood cells were the predominant factors affecting ethanolamide concentrations ex vivo. Accordingly, conditions that ensured rapid separation of plasma from blood cells and consistency in the blood harvesting procedures were established and implemented for clinical studies to minimize the ex vivo elevation of plasma ethanolamide concentrations. The variability (intra-subject and inter-subject) of plasma ethanolamide levels was evaluated in healthy subjects during a Phase 0 study (no drug administration) that simulated the design of single-ascending dose and multiple-ascending dose clinical trials in terms of sample collection time points, population, food, and activity. The data indicated there was relatively large inter- and intra-subject variation in plasma ethanolamide concentrations. In addition, apparent variations due to time of day and/or food effects were also revealed. Understanding the variability of ethanolamide levels in humans is very important for study design and data interpretation when changes in ethanolamide levels are used as target engagement biomarkers in clinical trials.","Journal of chromatography.

A limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 microg/kg was achieved for all target analytes, in all samples. Standard addition was used for quantification of PFC levels. All 11 of the targeted PFCs were detected in 75 individual food items. In 70% of the samples, including all meat other than offal, none of the analytes were present above the LOD. The highest levels found were 59 microg/kg perfluorooctanesulphonic acid (PFOS) and 63 microg/kg total PFCs (SigmaPFCs) in an eel sample, and 40 microg/kg PFOS (62 microg/kg SigmaPFCs) in a whitebait sample. The highest level in an offal sample was 10 microg/kg, in a wild roe deer liver. There were six samples with SigmaPFCs >15 microg/kg (fish, shellfish, crustaceans), a further seven samples with SigmaPFCs ranging 11-15 microg/kg (including a liver), nine with SigmaPFCs ranging 6-10 microg/kg (fish and livers), 31 with SigmaPFCs in the range 2-5 microg/kg (including kidneys, popcorn and processed peas) and a further 22 with SigmaPFCs close to the LOD of 1 microg/kg (including eggs and potatoes).

20145254,"The small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and alpha-crystallins are highly effective, ATP-independent chaperones that can bind denaturing client proteins to prevent their irreversible aggregation. One model of sHSP function suggests that the oligomeric sHSPs are activated to the client-binding form by dissociation at elevated temperatures to dimers or other sub-oligomeric species. Here we examine this model in a comparison of the oligomeric structure and chaperone activity of two conserved classes of cytosolic sHSPs in plants, the class I (CI) and class II (CII) proteins. Like the CI sHSPs, recombinant CII sHSPs from three divergent plant species, pea, wheat, and Arabidopsis, are dodecamers as determined by nano-electrospray mass spectrometry. While at 35 to 45 degrees C, all three CI sHSPs reversibly dissociate to dimers, the CII sHSPs retain oligomeric structure at high temperature. The CII dodecamers are, however, dynamic and rapidly exchange subunits, but unlike CI sHSPs, the exchange unit appears larger than a dimer. Differences in dodecameric structure are also reflected in the fact that the CII proteins do not hetero-oligomerize with CI sHSPs. Binding of the hydrophobic probe bis-ANS and limited proteolysis demonstrate CII proteins undergo significant, reversible structural changes at high temperature.

20144460,"This article describes the comparison of different versions of an easy, rapid and low-cost sample preparation approach for the determination of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables by concurrent use of gas and liquid chromatography (GC and LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) for detection. The sample preparation approach is known as QuEChERS, which stands for ""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe"". The three compared versions were based on the original unbuffered method, which was first published in 2003, and two interlaboratory validated versions: AOAC Official Method 2007.01, which uses acetate buffering, and European Committee for Standardization (CEN) Standard Method EN 15662, which calls for citrate buffering. LC-MS/MS and GC-MS analyses using each method were tested from 50 to 1000ng/g in apple-blueberry sauce, peas and limes spiked with 32 representative pesticides. As expected, the results were excellent (overall average of 98% recoveries with 10% RSD) using all 3 versions, except the unbuffered method gave somewhat lower recoveries for the few pH-dependent pesticides. The different methods worked equally well for all matrices tested with equivalent amounts of matrix co-extractives measured, matrix effects on quantification and chemical noise from matrix in the chromatographic backgrounds. The acetate-buffered version gave higher and more consistent recoveries for pymetrozine than the other versions in all 3 matrices and for thiabendazole in limes. None of the versions consistently worked well for chlorothalonil, folpet or tolylfluanid in peas, but the acetate-buffered method gave better results for screening of those pesticides. Also, due to the recent shortage in acetonitrile (MeCN), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) was evaluated as a substitute solvent in the acetate-buffered QuEChERS version, but it generally led to less clean extracts and lower recoveries of pymetrozine, thiabendazole, acephate, methamidophos, omethoate and dimethoate. In summary, the acetate-buffered version of QuEChERS using MeCN exhibited advantages compared to the other tested methods in the study.",Journal of chromatography.

Four groups of individual phenolic compounds, including phenolic acids, anthocyanins, and flavan-3-ols, as well as flavonols and flavones were quantified using HPLC, respectively. As compared to the original raw legumes, all processing methods caused significant (p<0.05) reduction in total phenolic content, procyanidin content, total saponin content, phytic acid content, chemical antioxidant capacities in terms of ferric reducing antioxidant power and peroxyl radical scavenging capacity, and cellular antioxidant activity as well as antiproliferation capacities of cool-season food legumes. Different cooking methods have varied effects on reducing total phenolics, saponins, phytic acids, and individual phenolic compounds. For all cool-season food legumes, steaming appeared to be a better cooking method than boiling in retaining antioxidants and phenolic components, whereas boiling appeared to be effective in reducing saponin and phytic acid contents. In the case of lentil, all thermal processing methods (except conventional steaming) caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in gallic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, sinapic, subtotal benzoic, subtotal cinnamic acid, and total phenolic acid.

An attempt was made to partially purify and characterize the diffusible antifungal metabolite/s produced by the strain RP24 and its negative mutant (NM) in potato dextrose medium. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of partially purified extract of RP24 showed the presence of lipopeptide antibiotic iturin as a major peak that was comparable to that of standard iturin A (5.230 min) from Sigma-Aldrich whereas the corresponding peak was absent in extract of NM. The structure was further confirmed by liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric (LCMS) analysis as iturin A. LCMS analysis also showed the presence of surfactin and fengycin besides iturin A. Amplification of the lpa-14 (encodes the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase required for the maturation of template enzyme of iturin A) and ituD (encodes a putative malonyl coenzyme A transacylase, whose disruption results in a specific deficiency in iturin A production) genes of iturin operon of strain RP24 was carried out and the sequences obtained were compared with the existing database of NCBI. The sequences of lpa-14 and ituD gene of RP24 showed 98% and 97% homology with lpa-14 and ituD genes of B. subtilis in the existing database.

We investigated OEA and PEA tissue level regulation by the nutritional status in lean and obese rats. OEA and PEA levels in the brainstem, duodenum, liver, pancreas, and visceral (VAT) or subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissues of 7-week-old wild-type (WT) and Zucker rats, fed ad libitum or following overnight food deprivation, with and without refeeding, were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In WT rats, duodenal OEA, but not PEA, levels were reduced by food deprivation and restored by refeeding, whereas the opposite was observed for OEA in the pancreas, and for both mediators in the liver and SAT. In ad lib fed Zucker rats, PEA and OEA levels were up to tenfold higher in the duodenum, slightly higher in the brainstem, and lower in the other tissues. Fasting/refeeding-induced changes in OEA levels were maintained in the duodenum, liver, and SAT, and lost in the pancreas, whereas fasting upregulated this compound also in the VAT. The observed changes in OEA levels in WT rats are relevant to the actions of this mediator on satiety, hepatic and adipocyte metabolism, and insulin release. OEA dysregulation in Zucker rats might counteract hyperphagia in the duodenum, but contribute to hyperinsulinemia in the pancreas, and to fat accumulation in adipose tissues and liver.

We report here the presence in pea (Pisum sativum) mitochondria and nuclei of a Trx isoform (PsTrxo1) that seems to belong to the Trx o group, although it differs from this Trx type by its absence of introns in the genomic sequence. Western-blot analysis with isolated mitochondria and nuclei, immunogold labeling, and green fluorescent protein fusion constructs all indicated that PsTrxo1 is present in both cell compartments. Moreover, the identification by tandem mass spectrometry of the native mitochondrial Trx after gel filtration using the fast-protein liquid chromatography system of highly purified mitochondria and the in vitro uptake assay into isolated mitochondria also corroborated a mitochondrial location for this protein. The recombinant PsTrxo1 protein has been shown to be reduced more effectively by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial Trx reductase Trr2 than by the wheat (Triticum aestivum) cytoplasmic reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent Trx reductase.

After hypoxia treatment for 4 days, the motor behavior of the snail was suppressed. Electrophysiological measurements from Pedal A (PeA) interneurons showed that hypoxia increased the frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic excitatory potentials (sEPSPs), but reduced the firing frequency, the amplitude, and the half-width duration (APD(50)) of spontaneous action potentials. Imaging with a fluorescent phosphate label, Pro-Q Diamond, revealed that the neuronal phosphoprotein level was reduced after the hypoxia treatment. The hypoxia-induced changes in the phosphoproteome of the central ganglia were quantified using one-dimensional gel-electrophoresis by comparing the fluorescence intensity ratio of phospholabeled phosphoproteins versus total proteins between the hypoxia and control groups. We analyzed 16 protein bands: eight showed decreased phosphorylation levels after hypoxia treatment, and eight did not change.

Like soybean (Glycine max) and pea (Pisum sativum), Lotus develops straight seed pods and each pod contains approximately 20 seeds that reach maturity within 40 days. Histological sections show the characteristic three developmental phases of legume seeds and the presence of embryo, endosperm, and seed coat in desiccated seeds. Furthermore, protein, oil, starch, phytic acid, and ash contents were determined, and this indicates that the composition of mature Lotus seed is more similar to soybean than to pea. In a first attempt to determine the seed proteome, both a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis approach and a gel-based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach were used. Globulins were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and five legumins, LLP1 to LLP5, and two convicilins, LCP1 and LCP2, were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. For two distinct developmental phases, seed filling and desiccation, a gel-based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach was used, and 665 and 181 unique proteins corresponding to gene accession numbers were identified for the two phases, respectively.

Two isoproteic (44.8%) and isolipidic (19.6%) extruded diets were formulated: a fish-meal-based diet (FM diet), containing fish meal as the sole protein source; a plant-protein-based diet (PP diet), where pea protein concentrate and wheat gluten meal replaced 80% of fish meal protein.

18944341,"ABSTRACT Inflorescences of field-grown grapevines (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Gamay) were inoculated with a Botrytis cinerea conidia suspension or dried conidia at different stages during bloom in moist weather. Approximately 10% of the conidia germinated within 72 h, resulting in two to three times more latent infections than uninoculated controls in pea-size (7 mm in diameter) berries. In surface-sterilized pea-size berries, latent B. cinerea was present predominantly in the receptacle area. After veraison, latent B. cinerea also was found in the style and, in mature berries, latent colonies were distributed throughout the pulp. Inoculation at full bloom led to the highest disease severity (66%) at harvest, compared with 38% in controls. Stilbene stress metabolites in the flowers were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Resveratrol accumulated mainly after pre-bloom and full-bloom inoculation, but did not prevent infection. Piceid levels did not change following inoculation, while epsilon-viniferin was found in necrotic tissues only, and pterostilbene and alphaviniferin were not detected at all. B. cinerea conidia suspensions also were applied to various locations on flowers of pot-grown cvs. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Inoculation of the receptacle area, but not that of the stigma and ovary, resulted in latent infections. Stilbene synthesis was similar to the field results, with resveratrol accumulating mainly in the calyptra and receptacle area. Constitutive soluble phenolic compounds (mainly derivatives of quercetin and hydroxy-cinnamic acid) were present at high concentrations in the calyptra but at low levels in the receptacle area. These experiments confirmed bloom as a critical time for B. cinerea infection in grapes and suggest that the most likely site of infection is the receptacle area or cap scar exposed at anthesis. Stilbenes may have a limited role in inhibition of flower infection and latency in susceptible grape cultivars, and epsilon-viniferin may be a by-product rather than a deterrent of infection.",Phytopathology,[],[],"Botrytis cinerea Infection in Grape Flowers: Defense Reaction, Latency, and Disease Expression.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18944341,2012

18621732,"Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and the related alpha-crystallins are ubiquitous chaperones linked to neurodegenerative diseases, myopathies, and cataract. To better define their mechanism of chaperone action, we used hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry (HXMS) to monitor conformational changes during complex formation between the structurally defined sHSPs, pea PsHsp18.1, and wheat TaHsp16.9, and the heat-denatured model substrates malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and firefly luciferase. Remarkably, we found that even when complexed with substrate, the highly dynamic local structure of the sHSPs, especially in the N-terminal arm (>70% exchange in 5 s), remains unchanged. These results, coupled with sHSP-substrate complex stability, indicate that sHSPs do not adopt new secondary structure when binding substrate and suggest sHSPs are tethered to substrate at multiple sites that are locally dynamic, a feature that likely facilitates recognition and refolding of sHSP-bound substrate by the Hsp70/DnaK chaperone system. Both substrates were found to be stabilized in a partially unfolded state that is observed only in the presence of sHSP. Furthermore, peptide-level HXMS showed MDH was substantially protected in two core regions (residues 95-156 and 228-252), which overlap with the MDH structure protected in the GroEL-bound MDH refolding intermediate. Significantly, despite differences in the size and structure of TaHsp16.9-MDH and PsHsp18.1-MDH complexes, peptide-level HXMS patterns for MDH in both complexes are virtually identical, indicating that stabilized MDH thermal unfolding intermediates are not determined by the identity of the sHSP.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D000818', 'D018834', 'D003903', 'D041961', 'D029968', 'D018840', 'D006360', 'D008291', 'D013058', 'D046912', 'D018532', 'D010940', 'D017510', 'D011994', 'D013552', 'D014908']","['Animals', 'Chaperonin 60', 'Deuterium', 'Deuterium Exchange Measurement', 'Escherichia coli Proteins', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Malate Dehydrogenase', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Peas', 'Plant Proteins', 'Protein Folding', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Swine', 'Triticum']",Insights into small heat shock protein and substrate structure during chaperone action derived from hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18621732,2008

The procedure involved the extraction of minute quantities (300-700 mg) of homogenized food sample with an aqueous solution containing 10% of THF and 0.5% of decanoic acid, conditions under which the coacervate (around 340 microL) formed in situ and instantaneously. The overall sample treatment, which included extraction and centrifugation, took about 25-30 min, and several samples could be simultaneously treated using conventional lab equipment. No clean-up or solvent evaporation were required. Extraction efficiencies mainly depended on the decanoic acid and THF concentration in the aqueous solution and were not affected by the pH or the temperature in the ranges studied (1-4 and 20-60 degrees C, respectively). Recoveries in samples ranged between about 81 and 96%.

At pH below 4, the uptake for As(III) and As(V) in roots was 137 and 124 mg As kg(-1) dry weight (d wt), respectively. Translocation of arsenic to the aerial part was relatively low ( approximately 5mg As kg(-1) d wt). The uptake for As(III) and As(V) in roots at pH 5.8 was about 43 and 30 mg As kg(-1) d wt, respectively, and translocation of As to the aerial part was not detectable. None of the arsenic treatments affected the total amylolitic activity in roots; however, the shoots from all treatments showed an increase in the total amylolitic activity. Alpha-amylase activity in the pea leaves was not significantly affected by arsenic treatments. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies showed a reduction of As(V) to As(III) in the roots.

This study was designed to compare the efficiency of four substrates, namely L-methionine (L-MET), 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid (KMBA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), and calcium carbide (CaC2) for ethylene biosynthesis in a sandy clay loam soil by gas chromatography. The classic ""triple"" response in etiolated pea seedling was employed as a bioassay to demonstrate the effect of substrate-dependent microbialy produced ethylene on plant growth. Results revealed that an amendment with L-MET, KMBA, ACC (up to 0.10 g/kg soil) and CaC2 (0.20 g/kg soil) significantly stimulated ethylene biosynthesis in soil. Overall, ACC proved to be the most effective substrate for ethylene production (1434 nmol/kg soil), followed by KMBA, L-MET, and CaC2 in descending order. Results further revealed that ethylene accumulation in soil released from these substrates created a classic ""triple"" response in etiolated pea seedlings with different degrees of efficacy. A more obvious classic ""triple"" response was observed at 0.15, 0.10, and 0.20 g/kg soil of L-MET, KMBA/ACC, and CaC2, respectively. Similarly, direct exposure of etiolated pea seedlings to commercial ethylene gas also modified the growth pattern in the same way. A significant direct correlation (r = 0.86 to 0.97) between substrate-derived [C2H4] and the classic triple response in etiolated pea seedlings was observed.

16169004,"The osmotic pressure of the body fluids of aphids is lower than in their diet of plant phloem sap. It is hypothesised that aphids reduce the osmotic pressure of ingested food by sucrase-mediated hydrolysis of dietary sucrose to glucose and fructose, and the polymerisation of glucose into oligosaccharides of low osmotic pressure per hexose unit. To test this hypothesis, the impact of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose on the sugar relations and osmoregulation of aphids was explored. Acarbose inhibited sucrase activity in gut homogenates and the production of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides in the honeydew of live aphids. Acarbose caused an increase in the haemolymph osmotic pressure for aphids reared on a diet (containing 0.75 M sucrose) hyperosmotic to the haemolymph and not on the isoosmotic diet containing 0.2 M sucrose. It did not affect aphid feeding rate over 2 days, except at high concentrations on 0.75 M sucrose diet, and this may have been a secondary consequence of osmotic dysfunction. Acarbose-treated aphids died prematurely. With 5 microM dietary acarbose, mean survivorship on 0.2 M sucrose diet was 4.2 days, not significantly different from starved aphids, indicating that, although these aphids fed, they were deprived of utilisable carbon; and on 0.75 M sucrose diet, mean survivorship was just 2.8 days, probably as a consequence of osmotic failure.

15825684,"This paper reports the results of studies performed to investigate the potential of applying thin layer chromatography (TLC) detection in combination with selected extraction and cleanup methods, for providing an alternative cost-effective analytical procedure for screening and confirmation of pesticide residues in plant commodities. The extraction was carried out with ethyl acetate and an on-line extraction method applying an acetone-dichloromethane mixture. The extracts were cleaned up with SX-3 gel, an adsorbent mixture of active carbon, magnesia, and diatomaceous earth, and on silica micro cartridges. The Rf values of 118 pesticides were tested in eleven elution systems with UV, and eight biotest methods and chemical detection reagents. Cabbage, green peas, orange, and tomatoes were selected as representative sample matrices for fruits and vegetables, while maize, rice, and wheat represented cereal grains. As an internal quality control measure, marker compounds were applied on each plate to verify the proper elution and detection conditions. The Rf values varied in the different elution systems. The best separation (widest Rf range) was achieved with silica gel (SG)--ethyl acetate (0.05-0.7), SG--benzene, (0.02-0.7) and reverse phase RP-18 F-254S layer with acetone: methanol: water/30:30:30 (v/v) (0.1-0.8). The relative standard deviation of Rf values (CV(Rf)) within laboratory reproducibility was generally less than 20%, except below 0.2 Rf, where the CVRf rapidly increased with decreasing Rf values. The fungi spore inhibition, chloroplast inhibition, and enzyme inhibition were found most suitable for detection of pesticides primarily for confirming their identity or screening for known substances. Their use for determination of pesticide residues in samples of unknown origin is not recommended.","Journal of environmental science and health. Part.

These major peptides were variants of pea albumin 1b (PA1b) with methionine sulfoxide rather than methionine at position 12. Peptide 3752 showed additional variations at positions 29 (valine for isoleucine) and 34 (histidine for asparagine). A minor, 37 amino acid peptide with a molecular mass of 3788 Da was also sequenced and differed from a known PA1b variant at positions 1, 25, and 31. Sequence variants of PA1b with their molecular masses were compiled, and variants that matched the accurate masses of the experimental peptides were used to narrow the search. MALDI postsource decay experiments on pronase fragments helped to confirm the sequences. Whole and dehulled field peas gave insecticidal C8 extracts in the laboratory that were enriched in peptides with masses of 3736, 3741, and 3789 Da, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

The biochemical role of PCNA in rolling circle replication (RCR) of geminivirus DNA has not been explored in detail. The initiation of RCR of the bipartite genome of a geminivirus, Indian mung bean yellow mosaic virus (IMYMV), is mainly controlled by viral protein Rep (or AL1 or AC1). The role of host PCNA in RCR of IMYMV was revealed by studying the physical and functional interactions between recombinant PCNA and recombinant IMYMV Rep. Pea nuclear PCNA as well as recombinant pea PCNA showed binding to recombinant Rep in experiments involving both affinity chromatography and yeast two-hybrid approaches. The contacting amino acid residues of PCNA seemed to be present throughout a wide region of the trimeric protein, while those of Rep appeared to be localized only in the middle part of the protein. The site-specific nicking-closing activity and the ATPase function of IMYMV Rep were impaired by PCNA.

Pea (Pisum sativum) is severely affected, and only moderate levels of genetic resistance have so far been identified. In the present work we selected the most resistant accession available (Ps 624) and compared it with a susceptible (Messire) cultivar. Experiments were performed by using pot and Petri dish bioassays, showing little differences in the percentage of broomrape seed germination induced by both genotypes, but a significant hamper in the number of successfully installed tubercles and their developmental stage in the Ps 624 compared to Messire. The protein profile of healthy and infected P. sativum root tissue were analysed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Approximately 500 individual protein spots could be detected on silver stained gels. At least 22 different protein spots differentiated control, non-infected, Messire and Ps 624 accessions. Some of them were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and database searching as cysteine proteinase, beta-1,3-glucanase, endochitinase, profucosidase, and ABA-responsive protein. Both qualitative and quantitative differences have been found among infected and non-infected root extracts. Thus, in the infected susceptible Messire genotype 34 spots were decreased, one increased and three newly detected, while in Ps 624, 15 spots were increased, three decreased and one newly detected. In response to the inoculation, proteins that correspond to enzymes of the carbohydrate metabolism (fructokinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase), nitrogen metabolism (ferredoxin-NADP reductase) and mitochondrial electronic chain transport (alternative oxidase 2) decreased in the susceptible check, while proteins that correspond to enzymes of the nitrogen assimilation pathway (glutamine synthetase) or typical pathogen defence, PR proteins, including beta-1,3-glucanase and peroxidases, increased in Ps 624.

Some of the functional properties of these proteins, including solubility, foaming, and emulsifying capacities, were investigated and compared. The solubility of purified cowpea vicilin was reduced at pH 5.0, increasing markedly below and above this value. Pea vicilin exhibited poor solubility between pH 5.0 and pH 6.0, and CPI was little soluble in the pH range from 4.0 to 6.0. At neutral pH, the emulsifying activity indexes (EAI) of purified pea vicilin and CPI were 194 and 291 m(2)/g, respectively, which compare quite favorably to EAIs of 110 and 133 m(2)/g for casein and albumin, respectively. Remarkably, purified cowpea vicilin exhibited an EAI of 490 m(2)/g, indicating a very high emulsifying activity.

Four discrete spectral forms of Pchlide, with emission peaks around 633, 640, 656 and 670 nm, could be distinguished after Gaussian deconvolution. In maize and wheat the 656 nm component was the most prominent, whereas for wild-type pea and its lip1 mutant, the 633 and 640 nm components contributed mostly to the fluorescence emission spectra. For the fluorescence lifetimes measured at 77 K a double exponential model was the most adequate to describe the Pchlide fluorescence decay not only for the Pchlide(650-656) form but also for the short-wavelength Pchlide forms. A fast component in the range 0.3-0.8 ns and a slow component in the range 5.1-7.1 ns were present in all samples, but the values varied, depending on species. The long-wavelength Pchlide(650-656) form had a slow component with a lifetime between 5.1 and 6.7 ns, probably reflecting the fluorescence from aggregated Pchlide. The short-wavelength Pchlide(628-633) form had values of the slow component varying between 6.2 and 7.1 ns. This represents a monomeric but probably protein-bound Pchlide form because the free Pchlide in solution has a much longer lifetime around 10 ns at 77 K.

A methacrylic acid-based imprinted polymer was prepared by precipitation polymerisation using propazine as template and toluene as porogen. After removal of the template by Soxhlet extraction, the optimum loading, washing, and elution conditions for MISPE of the selected triazines were established. The optimised MISPE procedure was applied to the extraction of the selected triazines in pea, potato, and corn sample extracts and a high degree of clean-up was obtained. However, some remaining interferences, non-specifically and strongly bound to the polymeric matrix, appeared in the chromatogram, preventing quantification of DIA in potatoes and DIA, DEA, and propazine in corn samples. Thus, a new clean-up protocol based on the use of a non-imprinted polymer for removal of these interferences prior to the MISPE step was developed.

Cell fractionation studies showed that the protein was abundant in the cytoskeleton fraction in dark-grown pea seedlings, but essentially was absent from the nucleus. Gel filtration column chromatography indicated that the native protein exists as a dimer, while isoelectric focusing suggested that there were at least four HMP isotypes. The protein co-eluted with ribosomes from a heparin affinity column in vitro, consistent with ribosome/polysome interactions in vivo. Significantly, sequence analysis of the C-terminal SNc motif may accurately predict nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization resulting in potentially very different functional roles for this protein family in different organisms.

In pea embryos, a granule-bound starch synthase protein (GBSSIa) is required for the synthesis of a significant portion of the amylose. However, this protein seems to be insignificant in the synthesis of amylose in pea leaves. cDNA clones encoding a second isoform of GBSSI, GBSSIb, have been isolated from pea leaves. Comparison of GBSSIa and GBSSIb activities shows them to have distinct properties. These differences have been confirmed by the expression of GBSSIa and GBSSIb in the amylose-free mutant of potato. GBSSIa and GBSSIb make distinct forms of amylose that differ in their molecular mass. These differences in product specificity, coupled with differences in the tissues in which GBSSIa and GBSSIb are most active, explain the distinct forms of amylose found in different tissues of pea.

By preserving the noncovalent interactions between subunits in the mass spectrometer, we show that these proteins are dodecameric. After mixing PsHSP18.1 and TaHSP16.9, a distribution of heterododecamers is formed. A comparison with spectra obtained from statistical modeling demonstrates that after equilibration the distribution of these heterocomplexes is governed by the starting ratio of the two components rather than an inherent preference for certain stoichiometries. This finding suggests that the two different sHSP subunits interact in a very similar manner. Following the kinetics of this reaction by mass spectrometry reveals that exchange proceeds via sequential incorporation of subunits with dimeric species being the principal units of exchange. Therefore, we conclude that sHSP complexes are in rapid dissociation/reassociation equilibria with suboligomeric forms.

In faba beans and peas, a reduction was observed which was more pronounced in the case of peas. For lupine seeds, the ripening produced an increase (34%) in the available/total niacin ratio 50 days after flowering (DAF).

Apple, asparagus, avocado, banana, carrot, celery, hazelnut, kiwi, onion, orange, pear, pignoli, strawberry, and walnut were particularly rich in Le(a)-carrying N-glycans. Although traces of Le(a)-containing structures were also present in almond, pistachio, potato, and tomato, no such glycans could be found in cauliflower. Coconut exhibited almost exclusively N-glycans containing only xylose but no fucose. Oligomannosidic N-glycans dominated in buckwheat and especially in the legume seeds mung bean, pea, peanut, and soybean. Papaya presented a unique set of hybrid type structures partially containing the Le(a) determinant.

In plants, very few actin-binding proteins have been identified and most are thought to modulate cytoskeleton function. To identify actin-binding proteins that are unique to plants, the development of new biochemical procedures will be critical. Affinity columns using actin monomers (globular actin, G-actin) or actin filaments (filamentous actin, F-actin) have been used to identify actin-binding proteins from a wide variety of organisms. Monomeric actin from zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) hypocotyl tissue was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and shown to be native and competent for polymerization to actin filaments. G-actin, F-actin and bovine serum albumin affinity columns were prepared and used to separate samples enriched in either soluble or membrane-associated actin-binding proteins. Extracts of soluble actin-binding proteins yield distinct patterns when eluted from the G-actin and F-actin columns, respectively, leading to the identification of a putative F-actin-binding protein of approximately 40 kDa. When plasma membrane-associated proteins were applied to these columns, two abundant polypeptides eluted selectively from the F-actin column and cross-reacted with antiserum against pea annexins. Additionally, a protein that binds auxin transport inhibitors, the naphthylphthalamic acid binding protein, which has been previously suggested to associate with the actin cytoskeleton, was eluted in a single peak from the F-actin column.

Effluents were collected through a nasointestinal tube and analysed for the enrichment in [15N] to evaluate the dietary nitrogen fraction. Detection and quantification of CMP was performed by an inhibition Elisa procedure. No trace of CMP was detected in the ileum of volunteers after the ingestion of the casein meal. The results showed that CMP appears in the jejunal effluents within the first 20 min after meal ingestion at a level varying from meal to meal. During digestion of whey protein, CMP appeared rapidly as a single peak and in high amounts, whereas it is discharged slowly in moderate proportions with the casein meal. These results demonstrate that CMP is emptied from the stomach in significant amounts during milk products digestion and support the hypothesis that food-born peptides could exert a physiological function. Moreover, in the present study a relation could be assumed between the amount of CMP in the meal and the stimulation of luminal endogenous nitrogen secretion. However, the specific physiological activity of CMP in humans, particularly on the digestion process, requires further studies.",Die Nahrung,"['D000328', 'D002364', 'D002851', 'D004032', 'D004797', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007082', 'D007413', 'D007583', 'D008297', 'D008894', 'D009584', 'D010446', 'D014674', 'D000067816', 'D015014']","['Adult', 'Caseins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diet', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ileum', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Jejunum', 'Male', 'Milk Proteins', 'Nitrogen', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Plant Proteins, Dietary', 'Whey Proteins', 'Yogurt']",Intraluminal immunoreactive caseinomacropeptide after milk protein ingestion in humans.,"[None, 'Q000276', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000493', 'Q000378', 'Q000276', 'Q000493', None, None]","[None, 'immunology', None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'pharmacokinetics', 'metabolism', 'immunology', 'pharmacokinetics', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10399354,1999

Acetyl-CoA and CoASH constituted at least 90% of the total CoA in freshly isolated chloroplasts. For a given chloroplast preparation, the concentration of endogenous acetyl-CoA was the same when extractions were performed using HClO4, trichloroacetic acid, propan-2-ol or chloroform/methanol, and the extracts analysed by quantitative HPLC after minimal processing. During fatty acid synthesis from acetate, concentrations of CoASH within spinach and pea chloroplasts varied from less than 0.1 to 5.0 microM. Malonyl-CoA concentrations were also very low (<0.1-3.0 microM) during fatty acid synthesis but could be calculated from radioactivity incorporated from [1-14C]acetate. Concentrations of CoASH in chloroplasts synthesizing fatty acids could be doubled in the presence of Triton X-100, suggesting that the detergent stimulates fatty acid synthesis by increasing the turnover rate of acyl-CoA. However, although taken up, exogenous CoASH (1 microM) did not stimulate fatty acid synthesis by permeabilized spinach chloroplasts. Calculated rates for acetyl-CoA synthetase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and malonyl-CoA-acyl-carrier protein transacylase reactions at the concentrations of metabolites measured here are < 0.1-4% of the observed rates of fatty acid synthesis from acetate by isolated chloroplasts.

Ten healthy male volunteers ingested 5 g of CP, wheat peptide (WP), pea peptide (PP), alanine, or leucine 30 min before alcohol intake at a dose of 0.5 g/kg, and blood ethanol and plasma amino acid concentrations were measured during a 2-h observation period after alcohol intake. In subjects who ingested CP, the blood ethanol level was lower than that in the WP, alanine and leucine ingestion groups, but did not decrease as compared to the control when they ingested PP. Similarly there was a difference in the blood ethanol level between alanine and leucine ingestion groups, and leucine ingestion was more effective than alanine against the reduction of the increase in blood ethanol level. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the plasma concentrations of individual amino acids except alanine, leucine, or lysine after alcohol intake among experimental groups as compared to the control. CP ingestion significantly elevated plasma alanine and leucine rather than other groups during a 2-h observation period. These results suggested that CP may have the effect on the reduction of increase in blood ethanol level after alcohol intake by the marked elevation of plasma alanine and leucine, especially leucine, but neither by the delay of ethanol release from the stomach nor malabsorption of ethanol in the gastrointestinal tracts.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","['D000328', 'D000409', 'D002492', 'D002851', 'D000431', 'D006801', 'D007930', 'D008297', 'D009842', 'D018532', 'D014674', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Adult', 'Alanine', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ethanol', 'Humans', 'Leucine', 'Male', 'Oligopeptides', 'Peas', 'Plant Proteins, Dietary', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",The effects of corn peptide ingestion on facilitating alcohol metabolism in healthy men.,"[None, 'Q000494', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'pharmacology', 'blood', None, 'blood', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9339548,1998

We analyzed whether CFBPases from different phylogenetic origin contain a common epitope. To this end a DNA fragment of 1200 base pairs encoding 338 amino acid residues of wheat CFBPase (38 kDa) was cloned in the expression plasmid pGEX-1 in frame with the gene coding for glutathione S-transferase (GT) of Schistosoma japonicun (26.5 kDa). Upon transformation of Escherichia coli and induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, centrifugation of the lysate partitioned 10% of the fusion protein in the supernatant fraction and the remaining 90% in the precipitate. The expected 65 kDa protein was purified from both the soluble and the particulate fraction by affinity chromatography on columns of glutathione-agarose. This fusion protein was successfully used to produce a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognized the CFBPase region of the fusion protein but not the GT moiety. Moreover, the monoclonal antibody immunoreacted not only with polypeptides (ca. 40 kDa) present in leaf crude extracts of other varieties of wheat (Triticum spelta, T. aestivum and T. durum), but also with homogeneous preparations of the spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) enzymes.

For this reason, microwave digestion with HNO3 and cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS) with tin (II) chloride reduction, were used. Both digestion and determination conditions were experimentally optimized. The procedure was checked using two real food samples: apple juice and preserved carrot with peas both spiked on two levels with mercury. On these results basic statistic parameters that characterized the method as standard deviation, relative standard deviation and recovery, were calculated. The precision was generally better than 10%, and recovery ranged from 96 to 100%. The detection limit of the entire procedure, defined as the mercury concentration corresponding to three times the standard deviation of ten consecutive determinations of blank measurement, was 0.012 microgram/l. Taking into account the amount of a sample and the factor of dilution the detection limit corresponds to 0.3 microgram/kg for 1.0 g, 1.0 microgram/kg for 0.3 g, and 0.15 microgram/l for 2 ml of a sample. Accuracy of the analytical procedure was tested by analysing five certified reference plant materials with the mercury contents ranged from 6 to 280 micrograms/kg.

Epidermal extracts from Brassica, pea, and leek exhibited higher activities toward saturated acyl-ACPs relative to 18:1-ACP when compared to total leaf or leaf parenchymal extracts.

8076634,"We show that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is present in maize, pea and wheat nuclei. We have identified the enzyme product as poly(ADP-ribose) by purification and electrophoresis on a DNA sequencing gel. This reveals a polymer ladder consisting of up to 45 residues. The polymer product from maize, after digestion with snake venom phosphodiesterase, gave only 5'-AMP and (phosphoribosyl)-AMP; the mean chain length of the polymer was 5 and 11 residues in two separate experiments. The optimum pH of the plant enzyme is greater than pH 7.0 in pea, wheat and maize; the optimum temperature for enzyme activity is approximately 15 degrees C. The Km for NAD+ for the enzyme from maize is estimated to be approximately 50 microM under optimal conditions. Several compounds (nicotinamide, deoxythymidine, 3-aminobenzamide, 3-methoxybenzamide and 5-bromodeoxyuridine) that specifically inhibit the animal enzyme also inhibit the enzyme from plants. The ratio of the IC50 for 5-bromodeoxyuridine to the IC50 for 3-aminobenzamide in maize is similar to that of the animal enzyme indicating that the enzyme involved is poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and not mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase.

They were separated on a reversed phase column with gradient elution using an acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran/imidazole buffer mobile phase and chemilumigenically determined using bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)-oxalate/hydrogen peroxide as post column reagents. The lower determination limits were as low as 1 x 10(-14)-3 x 10(-14) mol. AP, NE, pOHAP and PEA were derivatized with naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde, and were separated on a reversed phase column using an acetonitrile/imidazole buffer mobile phase and chemilumigenically determined. The lower determination limits were 3 x 10(-16)-1.5 x 10(-15) mol.

The proportion of cytosol aldolase as part of total aldolase activity was 8, 9, 14, and 4.5% in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), pea, wheat, and corn leaves, respectively. For corn leaves we also obtained values of up to 15%. The K(m) (FBP) values were about 5-fold lower for the cytosol (1.1-2.3 micromolar concentration) than for the chloroplast enzymes (8.0-10.5 micromolar concentration). The respective K(m) (fructose-1-phosphate, F1P) values were about equal for the cytosol (1.0-2.3 millimolar concentration) and for the chloroplast aldolase (0.6-1.7 millimolar concentration). The ratio V (FIP)/V (FBP) was 0.20 to 0.27 for the cytosol and 0.07 to 0.145 for the chloroplast aldolase. Thus, cytosol and chloroplast aldolases from spinach, pea, wheat, and corn leaves differ quite considerably in the elution pattern from DEAE-cellulose, in immunoprecipitability with antisera against the respective isoenzymes from spinach leaves, and in the affinity to FBP.",Plant physiology,[],[],"Distinction between Cytosol and Chloroplast Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolases from Pea, Wheat, and Corn Leaves.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16664617,2010

In different food samples iron to phosphorus ratio in phytate generally deviated significantly from the theoretical 1.20 value. Wheat flour products, maize, rice, beans, peas, lentil and soy from Vietnam and Hungary, furthermore several bakery products from Hungary and some imported soy products were analysed for phytate content. The effect of heat and fermentation on phytate content was also checked in breads and other foods.

6435524,"When infested with the fungus Rhizoctonia leguminicola, certain forages, e.g., red clover hay, can cause a ""slobber syndrome"" of varying severity when consumed by ruminants. The causative agent has been presumed to be slaframine [(1S,6S,8aS)-1-acetoxy-6-aminooctahydroindolizine], which is produced by R. leguminicola. In one serious outbreak of the slobber syndrome in horses, the red clover forage involved was carefully examined and found to contain R. leguminicola and slaframine. An identical hay sample is shown here by ion-exchange chromatographic and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of appropriate hay extracts to also contain swainsonine [(1S,2R,8R,8aR)-1,2,8-trihydroxyoctahydroindolizine], a potent alpha-mannosidase inhibitor. Swainsonine has previously been isolated from pure cultures of R. leguminicola and from higher plants, namely the Darling pea (Swainsona canescens) and spotted locoweed (Astragalus lentiginosus). Consumption of Darling pea and spotted locoweed by livestock results in a severe neurological condition resembling that observed in hereditary mannosidosis in cattle and humans. Our findings indicate that swainsonine may be viewed as a mycotoxin when present in moldy forages consumed by livestock.

An active epimerase in the membranes rapidly interconverted the two pentosyl nucleotides. Chromatographic analysis of the lipid extract revealed that both substrates gave rise to xylose- and arabinose-containing neutral lipids, xylolipid with properties similar to a polyisoprenol monophosphoryl derivative, and highly charged lipid-linked arabinosyl oligosaccharide. When UDP-[14C]pentose or the extracted lipid-linked [14C]arabinosyl oligosaccharide were used as substrates, their 14C was also incorporating into sodium dodecyl sulphate-soluble and -insoluble fractions as major end products. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of sodium dodecyl sulphate-soluble products indicated the formation of mobile components with Mr values between 40 000 and 200 000 (Sepharose CL-6B). The lipid-linked [14C]arabinosyl oligosaccharide possessed properties comparable with those of unsaturated polyisoprenyl pyrophosphoryl derivatives. It was hydrolysed by dilute acid to a charged product (apparent Mr 2300) that could be fractionated in alkali. It was degraded to shorter labelled oligosaccharides by slightly more concentrated acid and eventually to [14C]arabinose as the only labelled component.

This acceptor could not be distinguished from liver dolichyl monophosphate by t.l.c.

These results, together with those already reported [Pont Lezica, Brett, Romero Martinez & Dankert (1975) Biochem, Biophys. Res.

An enzyme preparation from pea seedlings was shown to use endogenous acceptors to form lipid phosphate sugars containing mannose and N-acetylglucosamine from GDP-mannose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.
