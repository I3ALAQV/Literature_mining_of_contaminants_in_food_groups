35347716,"Fermentation of eight vegetables was studied as an alternative for reclamation of surplus volumes. Fermentation performance was predicted by comparing the amounts of acid that could be produced from the intrinsic sugar content with that buffered by the fresh vegetable matrices prior to reaching an inhibitory pH for fermentative microbes (3.30). Native fermentations were brined with 345.0 mM sodium chloride, 40.0 mM calcium chloride, 6.0 mM potassium sorbate, and vinegar to adjust the initial pH to 4.70. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis, pH, and carbon dioxide measurements and spiral plating on selective media were employed to monitor the progress of fermentations. The average colony counts for yeast and/or molds and Enterobacteriaceae declined to undetectable levels from 3.6 ± 1.5 log CFU/ml within 7 days of fermentation. The fermentation of sugars produced lactic, acetic, succinic, and/or malic acids, and ethanol. As predicted, the fermentation of vegetables with low sugar content, such as broccoli, green leaf lettuce, and green pea proceeded to completion. The fermentation of vegetables with a moderate sugar content, such as green bell pepper, red ripened tomato, and green bean were incomplete at pH 3.1 ± 0.2. The fermentation of high sugar vegetables including sweet potato and corn were expected and observed to be incomplete. It is concluded that the intrinsic sugar content and buffer capacity of surplus vegetables are relevant parameters in obtaining complete fermentations. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Vegetables are the second most wasted commodity in the United States and a substantial constituent of the global food waste. Development of fermentation to reclaim surplus vegetables from farms, grocery stores, and farmer's markets offers opportunities to ameliorate economic losses and environmental impact and add value to waste. The research described here suggests that a fraction of vegetables could be fermented in cover brines while others, with high sugar content, need specialized handling. Evidently, optimization of vegetable fermentation with starter cultures and added buffers represent an opportunity to stimulate complete bioconversions useful for reclaiming surplus volumes.",Journal of food science,[],[],Vegetable fermentations brined with low salt for reclaiming food waste.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35347716,2022
35080159,"Disulfoton, an organophosphorus pesticide, is used to control cotton, beet, potato, and other seedling period aphids, leaf moths, underground pests, etc., with internal absorption, killing, gastric poisoning, and fumigation. Disulfoton is a highly toxic organophosphate pesticide, which can inhibit cholinesterase activity, resulting in neurophysiological disorders by inhalation, feeding, and transdermal absorption. Disulfoton is difficult to degrade in the environment, which leads to enrichment in organisms and interference with endocrine. This compound is harmful to the ecological environment and human health. To ensure the quality and safety of food, it is important to develop a detection method for disulfoton and its metabolites in agricultural products. A reliable method based on dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) with ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was developed for the determination of disulfoton and its metabolites (disulfoton sulfone, disulfoton sulfoxide, demeton-",Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,"['D002851', 'D004222', 'D006801', 'D037742', 'D009943', 'D010575', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Disulfoton', 'Humans', 'Nanotubes, Carbon', 'Organophosphorus Compounds', 'Pesticides', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",[Determination of disulfoton and its metabolites in agricultural products by dispersive soild phase extraction-ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry].,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35080159,2022
34985214,"Chlorpropham is a plant growth regulator and a herbicide. It is commonly used in the post-harvest treatment of potato to inhibit germination. It can also be used for flower thinning and fruit thinning of fruit trees, and for controlling annual gramineous weeds and a few broad-leaved weeds. Improper or excessive use of chlorpropham in crop cultivation will affect the safety of animal-derived food and impair human health through the food chain and water cycle. Therefore, accurate quantification of chlorpropham is imperative for risk assessment and mitigating risks to food safety. A method based on solid phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS) was established for the determination of chlorpropham in animal-derived food. First, the pretreatment conditions were optimized. To purify the samples and remove impurities, SPE column cartridges with different packing materials such as PXC, PXA, Florisil, and PLS were investigated. Based on the retention of chlorpropham, the ProElut PLS SPE column was selected as the pretreatment purification column. The washing solution and eluents were then optimized. When water was used as the washing solution, chlorpropham remained adsorbed on the SPE column and was not eluted along with other water-soluble substances. When the proportion of acetonitrile exceeded 40%, chlorpropham adsorbed on the filler of the SPE column could be gradually washed down. Acetonitrile-water solution(30∶70, v/v) was used for washing the SPE column. The elution ability of seven eluents for chlorpropham on the SPE column was then investigated. Among them, pure methanol, pure acetonitrile, and 1% (v/v) formic acid-methanol showed better elution effect. Considering that acetonitrile was used in the sample extraction, it was chosen as the mobile phase eluent. Subsequently, the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters were optimized. By examining the ionization cracking of chlorpropham, the quasimolecular ions and corresponding fragmentations in the chlorpropham primary MS were determined. The separation effect of three C18 columns was investigated. Based on the retention ability and peak effect of chlorpropham on the column, the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) column was used for chlorpropham separation. The response of chlorpropham in the positive and negative ionization modes was investigated and optimized. The results showed that the response was better in the positive ion mode than that in the negative ion mode. After optimizing the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters, the sensitivity of the method was improved. Finally, the analytes were separated on the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) under a gradient elution program using acetonitrile and 0.2% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution as the mobile phases.

These by-products represent an interesting and economical source of added value components with potential functionalities and/or bioactivities, which might be explored for industrial purposes, encouraging and promoting the circular economy concept. In this context, the current work aimed to evaluate the fatty acids (FAs) profile using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), as well as the determination of related health lipid indices (e.g., atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI)) as a powerful strategy to investigate the potential applications of different agri-food by-products for human nutrition and animal feeding. This work results showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the predominant group in grape pomace (72.7%), grape bunches (54.3%), and brewer's spent grain (BSG, 59.0%), whereas carrot peels are dominated by monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs, 47.3%), and grape stems (46.2%), lees (from 50.8 to 74.1%), and potato peels (77.2%) by saturated fatty acids (SFAs). These findings represent a scientific basis for exploring the nutritional properties of agri-food by-products.

In this context, knowledge of the sensory properties of whole sterilised chickpeas is required to be able to make them more attractive to the consumers. The sensory quality of chickpeas is largely dependent on the aroma and flavour, which can be influenced by storage conditions. In this study, sterilised chickpeas in two different packaging materials with different oxygen permeabilities, stored up to 52 weeks at ambient temperature (20 °C) were investigated using both descriptive sensory profiling and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry - olfactometry analysis (GC-MS-O). During storage, intense, sulphury and meat-like aromas decreased in intensity, while with longer storage time hay-like, green-like and potato-like flavours and aromas became more apparent. A total of 40 odour-active volatiles were detected, of which some had properties reminiscent of the chickpea flavour profiles. However, no clear relationships could be established between these odorants and the sensory changes observed during storage by descriptive sensory analysis. It was concluded that, significant changes in the sensory attributes of sterilised chickpeas occurred during 52 weeks of storage, but that packaging material does not seem to largely influence the sensory attributes during storage.",Current research in food science,[],[],Flavour stability of sterilised chickpeas stored in pouches.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34786560,2021

34677020,"Starch occurs naturally in the form of semicrystalline granules, and is composed of two types of carbohydrate molecules, amylose (AM) and amylopectin (AP). Starch granules and starch molecules have sizes in the range of 1-100 μm and 20-250 nm, respectively; these size ranges are among the key factors affecting the functional properties of starch. Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) is a size-based separation technique. The major difference between AF4 and dynamic light scattering or microscopy techniques is that AF4 enables the separation of particles based on their size; consequently, the elution profile can be converted to the size distribution of the samples. In the last two decades, AF4 systems, when coupled online with multiangle light scattering (MALS) and differential refractive index (dRI) detectors (AF4-MALS-dRI), have demonstrated to be applicable for the size characterization of starch at the molecular level. Unlike size exclusion chromatography (SEC), AF4 systems use an open channel that does not require a stationary phase or packing materials. Thus, the shear scission of AP molecules during AF4 separation is minimized. The size detection range of a commercial AF4 system ranges from 1 nm to 10 μm, which is smaller than the size range of starch granules. In this study, a home-made AF4 system was developed, and its capability for the size characterization of starch granules extracted from sweet potato, lotus seed, and rice was investigated. The performance of the developed AF4 system was evaluated by running a mixture of polystyrene (PS) with diameter of 2, 6, 12, and 20 μm, respectively. Baseline separation of four PS samples was achieved, and the resolution for 6 μm PS and 12 μm PS was 1.40. The detection limit of the developed AF4 system was higher than that of commercial AF4 systems. Thus, the developed AF4 system is promising for the separation and characterization of starch granules. The effect of the composition of the carrier liquid on the AF4 separation of starch granules was also studied. Moreover, the accuracy of AF4 in terms of size characterization of the starch granules was evaluated by optical microscopy (OM). The results revealed that the type of dispersant and viscosity of the carrier liquid affect the accuracy of size characterization of the starch granules.

A procedure based on headspace solid-phase microextraction (HP-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed to investigate the volatile compounds of sweet potato. The experimental conditions (fiber coating, incubation temperature and time, extraction time) were optimized for the extraction of volatile compounds from sweet potato. The samples incubated at 80 °C for 30 min and extracted at 80 °C by the fiber with a divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) coating for 30 min gave the most effective extraction of the analytes. The optimized method was applied to study the volatile profile of four sweet potato cultivars (Anna, Jieshu95-16, Ayamursaki, and Shuangzai) with different aroma. In total, 68 compounds were identified and the dominants were aldehydes, followed by alcohols, ketones, and terpenes. Significant differences were observed among the volatile profile of four cultivars. Furthermore, each cultivar was characterized by different compounds with typical flavor. The results substantiated that the optimized HS-SPME GC-MS method could provide an efficient and convenient approach to study the flavor characteristics of sweet potato.

34448159,"The potato is among the most important food crops in the world and of incalculable value for global food security. In 2012, the crop area for potato in Northern and Western Europe reached almost 1 million ha and a production of over 37 million tons with an average yield between 18 and 45 tons/ha. However, current potato production is put in jeopardy by a number of important biotic stress factors including late blight (Phytophthora infestans), which was responsible for the disastrous Irish potato famine during 1843-1845. P. infestans shows a remarkable capacity for adaptation with respect to host genotype and applied fungicides. This has made disease management to become more and more difficult and put substantial emphasis on gaining more detailed insight into the molecular bases of plant pathogen interactions, in order to find more sophisticated ways for biological pest control. The plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) play central roles in the regulation of plant responses to biotic foes. In addition, other phytohormones including auxins and abscisic acid (ABA) have also been associated with plant defense responses. For this reason, the parallel analysis of multiple plant hormones in small tissue amounts represents an important field of research in contemporary plant sciences.

Because of the increased incidence of self-consciousness in people owing to thinning hair, in this study, we examined the hair growth-inducing effects of shochu oil. Minoxidil, the only topical medication approved for hair growth treatment in Japan, was used as a control for the evaluation of hair growth-promoting activity of shochu oil. Human follicle dermal papilla cells treated with shochu oil showed upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that shochu oil induced the activation of the hair growth cycle. In vivo, epidermal treatment with shochu oil also promoted hair growth in C3H mice. More than 35 components were detected in shochu oil via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The main components, accounting for 98.5% of shochu oil, were as follows, in order of decreasing concentration: ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl oleate, ethyl stearate, ethyl caprate, ethyl laurate, ethyl myristate, and ethyl α-linolenate. Among these, ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate, and ethyl α-linolenate promoted hair growth in C3H mice. These results indicate that shochu oil can be used as a hair restorer.

33294837,"The fast and non-invasive detection of odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by gas sensors and electronic noses is a growing field of interest, mostly due to a large scope of potential applications. Additional drivers for the expansion of the field include the development of alternative and sustainable sensing materials. The discovery that isolated cross-linked polymeric structures of suberin spontaneously self-assemble as a film inspired us to develop new sensing composite materials consisting of suberin and a liquid crystal (LC). Due to their stimuli-responsive and optically active nature, liquid crystals are interesting probes in gas sensing. Herein, we report the isolation and the chemical characterization of two suberin types (from cork and from potato peels) resorting to analyses of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The collected data highlighted their compositional and structural differences. Cork suberin showed a higher proportion of longer aliphatic constituents and is more esterified than potato suberin. Accordingly, when casted it formed films with larger surface irregularities and a higher C/O ratio. When either type of suberin was combined with the liquid crystal 5CB, the ensuing hybrid materials showed distinctive morphological and sensing properties towards a set of 12 VOCs (comprising heptane, hexane, chloroform, toluene, dichlormethane, diethylether, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetone, ethanol, methanol, and acetic acid). The optical responses generated by the materials are reversible and reproducible, showing stability for 3 weeks. The individual VOC-sensing responses of the two hybrid materials are discussed taking as basis the chemistry of each suberin type. A support vector machines (SVM) algorithm based on the features of the optical responses was implemented to assess the VOC identification ability of the materials, revealing that the two distinct suberin-based sensors complement each other, since they selectively identify distinct VOCs or VOC groups. It is expected that such new environmentally-friendly gas sensing materials derived from natural diversity can be combined in arrays to enlarge selectivity and sensing capacity.",Materials today.

In this study, EOs of the Lemongrass (LGO) and Clove (CO) were used against Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), a causal agent of take-all disease of wheat. To provide controlled delivery of the EOs, they were encapsulated into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) and then compared to the effects of pure EOs both in- vitro and in- vivo. MSNPs were synthesized via the sol-gel process. Various techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and UV-Vis spectroscopy were used to evaluate the successful loading of the EOs into the pore of MSNPs. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) was calculated as high as 84.24% for LGO and 80.69% for CO, while loading efficiency (LE) was determined 36% and 29% for LGO and CO, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) displayed spherical shapes and porous structures with average diameters of 50-70 nm. Recognition of the main components of the EOs via gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) before and after the EO loading, detected eugenol and citral as the most frequent compounds in LGO and CO, respectively. For antifungal test in- vitro, selected concentrations of the pure EOs, EOs loaded in MSNPs (EOs- MSNPs) and Mancozeb ® fungicide based on pre-tests were mixed using potato dextrose agar (PDA). The inhibition percentage (IP) of fungal growth at each concentration, as well as minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFC) were obtained. The results indicated that antifungal effects in the encapsulated form increased by up to three times. In- vivo, the sterile wheat seeds were treated with pure EOs, EOs-MSNPs, and mancozeb at MFC concentration. Also, in order to keep on the EOs-MSNPs around the seeds, sodium alginate was used. The consequences of in- vivo experiments indicated that rate of disease control in presence of EOs-MSNPs and mancozeb was the same (~70%) and higher than pure EOs (LGO: 57.44%, CO: 49%). Also, improving the growth parameters in wheat plant, the covering of the EOs-MSNPs in alginate, had better control (84%) than that of EOs-MSNPs alone. Further, the release kinetics studies showed a gradual release of LGO and CO from MSNPs for four weeks in water and for five weeks in the soil-plant system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the control effect of LGO, CO, and their nanocapsule in MSNPs against the take-all disease of wheat.

Therefore, there is a risk that these pesticides are present in tubers, thus posing a toxicological risk to the consumer. In this respect, it is necessary to monitor the presence of these compounds in edible plants. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to develop a novel, simple and robust analytical procedure for simultaneous determination of above-mentioned pesticides in potato tubers. To develop an analytical procedure that fulfills SANTE demands, quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method and matrix solid phase dispersion technique were investigated.

Principal component analysis (PCA) combined with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) approach was performed to explore their relationships. The variables contributing most to the PCA results were extracted for CCA, and the results indicated that several amino acids, including lysine, tryptophan, alanine, phenylalanine, aspartate, and glutamate, have significant impacts on acrylamide and β-carboline heterocyclic amine formation. Moreover, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid, α-solanine, and α-chaconine were also important factors associated with acrylamide and β-carboline heterocyclic amine formation.

32454365,"Although Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus are the main microorganisms of concern in peanuts, due to aflatoxin contamination, several Salmonella outbreaks from this product have been reported over the last ten decades. Thus, it is important to understand the relationship between microorganisms to predict, manage and estimate the diversity in the peanut supply chain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate aflatoxin production during the co-cultivation of Aspergillus section Flavi and Salmonella both isolated from peanuts. Three strains of A. section Flavi: A. flavus producing aflatoxin B, A. flavus non-producing aflatoxin and A. parasiticus producing aflatoxin B and G were co-cultivated with seven serotypes of Salmonella of which six were isolated from the peanut supply chain (S. Muenster, S. Miami, S. Glostrup, S. Javiana, S. Oranienburg and S. Yoruba) and one was S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028. First of all, each Salmonella strain was inoculated by pour plate (ca. 5 log cfu/mL) in PDA (potato dextrose agar). Then, each pre-cultured fungus was inoculated in the center of the petri dish. The plates were incubated at 30 °C and the fungal colony diameter was measured once a day for 7 days. As a control each Aspergillus strain was cultivated in the absence of Salmonella culture. All three strains of Aspergillus with absence of Salmonella (control) reached the maximum colony diameter and their growth rate was influenced when co-cultivated (p < 0.05) with all Salmonella serotypes tested. The maximum inhibition in the colony diameter was 20% for A. flavus aflatoxin B producer and A. parasiticus, and 18% for A. flavus non- aflatoxin producer when cultivated with Salmonella. However, no significant difference (p < 0.05) in reduction of colony diameter was observed among the Salmonella serotypes. Aflatoxin production was determined previously, by using the agar plug technique on thin layer chromatography (TLC). The production of aflatoxin G by A. parasiticus in co-cultivation with Salmonella was not observed. On the other hand, A. flavus preserved their characteristics of aflatoxin B production. The quantification of aflatoxin reduction by Salmonella interaction was evaluated using HPLC method. There was a maximum reduction of aflatoxin production of 88.7% and 72.9% in A. flavus and A. parasiticus, respectively, when cultivated with Salmonella. These results indicate that some serotypes of Salmonella may interfere with aflatoxin production and fungal growth of A. flavus and A. parasiticus in the peanut supply chain.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D016604', 'D000348', 'D000898', 'D010367', 'D001231', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D012475']","['Aflatoxin B1', 'Aflatoxins', 'Antibiosis', 'Arachis', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Salmonella']",Interaction of Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus with Salmonella spp. isolated from peanuts.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000502', 'Q000382', 'Q000254', 'Q000517', None, 'Q000302']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'physiology', 'microbiology', 'growth & development', 'prevention & control', None, 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32454365,2020
32310016,"Acrylamide, a known carcinogen, is formed during preparation of food containing reducing sugar and asparagine. Because acrylamide exposure of the population is primarily through food, the maximum levels of acrylamide in food were set by the European Commission in 2017. Moreover, in the 2016 Korean Total Diet study, acrylamide showed the lowest margin of exposure among 23 food-processing-related chemicals, necessitating risk reduction options. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the variation of acrylamide content in different food items and identify the food categories, to provide options for risk management. Acrylamide was analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in more than 1,000 processed food items. To estimate acrylamide exposure, the analytical data obtained herein and the food consumption data of Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2013 to 2017 were used. A non-parametric technique of a probabilistic model was used for exposure estimation. Confectioneries (here this category includes potato and similar savoury snacks) contained a wide range of acrylamide content. Particularly, the highest acrylamide content was detected in a tea made of Jerusalem artichoke. The presence of acrylamide in turmeric along with the Jerusalem artichoke was reported in this study for the first time. The main contributors of dietary acrylamide exposure were confectioneries for youths aged 3-18 years and coffee for adults aged 19-80 years. Therefore, risk management in confectionery and coffee could help reduce acrylamide exposure for Koreans. In addition, the mitigation strategies for food containing high acrylamide content, such as Jerusalem artichoke tea, are needed to reduce acrylamide exposure to loyal consumers.","Food additives & contaminants.

Matrices tested included 2 types of pet food jerky treats (chicken and sweet potato), bovine blood, and bovine liver and kidney. The instrument comparison study confirmed that ICP-MS provided the sensitivity necessary for the analysis of all heavy metals tested at concentrations below the level of concern for routine diagnostic testing. The ""in-house"" method comparison samples, spiked at low (0.04 µg/g), medium (0.4 µg/g), and high (8.0 µg/g; note: the high validation level spike for mercury was 2 µg/g) concentration levels, indicated that ICP-MS can meet U.S. FDA acceptance criteria for both accuracy (90-105% recovery) and precision (< 6% coefficient of variation).

Overall, our study showed that ICP-MS is a reproducible method for the analysis of heavy metals in spite of minor differences in methodology.","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc","['D000821', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D007668', 'D008099', 'D013058', 'D019216']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metals, Heavy']",Interlaboratory comparison of heavy metal testing in animal diagnostic specimens and feed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000662', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'blood', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'veterinary', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32052705,2020
31846858,"This paper describes a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (HILIC-MS/MS) method for determining acrylamide in food. The method primary optimised for gingerbread samples that have high sugar contents. A new sample preparation process was optimized using an experiment design based on a central composition design (CCD). A mixture of acidified aqueous acetonitrile was established as a suitable extraction medium. The extracts were further diluted and separation of acrylamide on TSKgel Amide-80 HILIC column was carried out within 8 min. The method was validated using naturally contaminated quality check (QC) as well as spiked samples. The developed method showed acceptable accuracy (101% - 105%) and precision (2.9% - 7.6%). The limit of quantification was 20 µg/kg. The method was also tested by analysing acrylamide in other food samples (bread, roasted coffee, instant coffee, cappuccino powder and fried potato). The acrylamide concentrations found in samples were between 20 µg/kg and 667 µg/kg, which were lower than the benchmark levels set by the European Union (EU). The main advantage of the newly developed method over the standard methods included the easier sample preparation and faster analysis with reduced ion suppression.","Journal of chromatography.

Fifteen volatile compounds with the highest odor activity values (OAV > 100) were selected as the key odors contributing to the flavor profile of microwaved sesame oil, including 2-methyl-propanal (pungent, malt, green), 2-methyl-butanal (cocoa, almond), furaneol (caramel), 1-octen-3-one (mushroom), 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one (sweet), 1-nonanol (fat, citrus, green), 2-methyl-phenol (phenol), 2-methoxy-phenol (smoke, sweet), 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (clove, curry), 2,5-dimethyl-pyrazine (cocoa, roasted nut, roast beef), 2-furfurylthiol (coffee, roast), 2-thiophenemethanethiol (sulfur), methanethiol (gasoline, garlic), methional (cooked potato), and dimethyl trisulfide (fish, cabbage). The OAVs significantly increased with a longer microwave process.

However, unlike cereal and potato products, there are no standardized methods or certified reference materials for olives and no harmonization between laboratories performing routine analyses. The industry has observed inconsistencies between laboratories using different analytical methods. To narrow the cause of this variability, acrylamide was extracted from olives using a single protocol and analyzed with the most commonly used routine methods: liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (LC-UV) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) without bromination and LC-UV and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) following bromination. This design specifically evaluated the effects of sample derivatization and detector on acrylamide measurements, which has not been documented for any food. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, linearity, and reproducibility were assessed, and 10 commercial olive samples were analyzed. LC-MS/MS demonstrated the best overall performance. Although derivatization decreased precision and reproducibility, all detection methods had comparable accuracy and calculated acrylamide values.

Despite being one of the most important foods, there is no simple way to control tuber quality and, in particular, controlling sprouting. Chemical suppression such as chlorpropham is used to inhibit sprouting, however, the regulatory status of such chemical inhibition differs in each country. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was applied to identify the applicable biomarkers for prediction of potato sprouting during long-term storage. Sprouting was measured in chipping potatoes, and these were also subjected to metabolite profiling to develop a predictive model. The model was based on projections to latent structures (PLS) regression calculated from a metabolome data set obtained before storage and was consistent with actual measured sprouting values.

30186828,"Dietary plant foods are characterized by a vast molecular diversity of glycosylated sterols (SG) that differ in the structure of the steryl backbone. The identification of these polar steryl conjugates represents a major challenge as they are structurally highly similar, and commercial standards are limited to a few naturally abundant species. Spectral databases do not yet contain MS/MS spectra of these sterol conjugates obtained by electrospray ionization (ESI), which would facilitate their reliable identification. Thus, this study aimed at providing novel information on ESI-MS/MS spectra of both abundant and minor SG found in foods. As a first step, however, free sterols (FS) were investigated for their fragmentation behavior as they share the same intermediate ion as SG. Pure SG were obtained from commercially available standard mixtures and minor SG were extracted from different food sources (oat bran, wheat bran, pumpkin seeds, melon, rapeseeds, and potato peel). ESI-MS/MS spectra of 15 FS were assessed and fragment ions reflective of structural features were identified and rationalized. Subsequently, 14 SG were identified at four different levels, while relative retention times from chromatographic separation and spectral features of FS served to identify five SG. Spectral data from FS were directly transferable to SG when analyzed as aglycone ions as shown by similarity scores while SG were characterized by shorter retention times in reverse phase chromatography and the additional analysis as sodiated adduct confirmed their glycosidic nature. Moreover, we report for the first time the occurrence of 24-methylenecholesterol and a 4-monomethyl sterol as glycosidic conjugates in higher plants.

We compared EAA contents and AA composition of a large selection of plant-based protein sources with animal-based proteins and human skeletal muscle protein. AA composition of oat, lupin, wheat, hemp, microalgae, soy, brown rice, pea, corn, potato, milk, whey, caseinate, casein, egg, and human skeletal muscle protein were assessed using UPLC-MS/MS. EAA contents of plant-based protein isolates such as oat (21%), lupin (21%), and wheat (22%) were lower than animal-based proteins (whey 43%, milk 39%, casein 34%, and egg 32%) and muscle protein (38%). AA profiles largely differed among plant-based proteins with leucine contents ranging from 5.1% for hemp to 13.5% for corn protein, compared to 9.0% for milk, 7.0% for egg, and 7.6% for muscle protein. Methionine and lysine were typically lower in plant-based proteins (1.0 ± 0.3 and 3.6 ± 0.6%) compared with animal-based proteins (2.5 ± 0.1 and 7.0 ± 0.6%) and muscle protein (2.0 and 7.8%, respectively). In conclusion, there are large differences in EAA contents and AA composition between various plant-based protein isolates. Combinations of various plant-based protein isolates or blends of animal and plant-based proteins can provide protein characteristics that closely reflect the typical characteristics of animal-based proteins.",Amino acids,"['D000596', 'D000601', 'D002853', 'D055951', 'D006801', 'D009124', 'D018482', 'D014674', 'D014176', 'D053719']","['Amino Acids', 'Amino Acids, Essential', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Functional Food', 'Humans', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Plant Proteins, Dietary', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Protein content and amino acid composition of commercially available plant-based protein isolates.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30167963,2019

Potato peel powders were prepared from the following fresh commercial potato varieties by hand-peeling and then freeze-drying and grinding the peels into powder: non-organic (conventionally grown) gold, red, and Russet and organically grown Russet. Mice diets (25% fat by weight) were supplemented with either 10 or 20% potato peel powders for 3 weeks. In comparison to the control diet, the isocaloric and isonitrogenous peel-containing diets induced a reduction in weight gain that ranged from 17-45% (10% peel diets) to 46-73% (20% peel diets), suggesting that differences in weight gain are associated with the potato peel source and peel concentration of the diet. Weight reductions were accompanied by reduced epididymal white adipose tissue ranging from 22 to 80% as well as changes in the microbiota analyzed using next-generation sequencing and in obesity-associated genetic biomarkers determined by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Safety aspects and possible mechanisms of the antiobesity effects are discussed in terms of the composition of the bioactive potato peel compounds, which were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography.

28664422,"Metabolite profiling of tuber flesh and peel for selected colored potato varieties revealed cultivar and tissue specific profiles of anthocyanins and other polyphenols with variations in composition and concentration. Starchy tubers of Solanum tuberosum are a staple crop and food in many countries. Among cultivated potato varieties a huge biodiversity exists, including an increasing number of red and purple colored cultivars. This coloration relates to the accumulation of anthocyanins and is supposed to offer nutritional benefits possibly associated with the antioxidative capacity of anthocyanins. However, the anthocyanin composition and its relation to the overall polyphenol constitution in colored potato tubers have not been investigated closely. This study focuses on the phytochemical characterization of the phenolic composition of a variety of colored potato tubers, both for peel and flesh tissues. First, liquid chromatography (LC) separation coupled to UV and mass spectrometry (MS) detection of polyphenolic compounds of potato tubers from 57 cultivars was used to assign groups of potato cultivars differing in their anthocyanin and polyphenol profiles. Tissues from 19 selected cultivars were then analyzed by LC separation coupled to multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) to detect quantitative differences in anthocyanin and polyphenol composition. The measured intensities of 21 anthocyanins present in the analyzed potato cultivars and tissues could be correlated with the specific tuber coloration. Besides secondary metabolites well-known for potato tubers, the metabolic profiling led to the detection of two anthocyanins not described for potato tuber previously, which we tentatively annotated as pelargonidin feruloyl-xylosyl-glucosyl-galactoside and cyanidin 3-p-coumaroylrutinoside-5-glucoside. We detected significant correlations between some of the measured metabolites, as for example the negative correlation between the main anthocyanins of red and blue potato cultivars. Mainly hydroxylation and methylation patterns of the B-ring of dihydroflavonols, leading to the formation of specific anthocyanidin backbones, can be assigned to a distinct coloring of the potato cultivars and tuber tissues. However, basically the same glycosylation and acylation reactions occur regardless of the main anthocyanidin precursor present in the respective red and blue/purple tissue. Thus, the different anthocyanin profiles in red and blue potato cultivars likely relate to superior regulation of the expression and activities of hydroxylases and methyltransferases rather than to differences for downstream glycosyl- and acyltransferases. In this regard, the characterized potato cultivars represent a valuable resource for the molecular analysis of the genetic background and the regulation of anthocyanin side chain modification.",Planta,"['D000872', 'D000975', 'D053898', 'D002853', 'D016000', 'D005838', 'D013058', 'D009928', 'D010858', 'D010860', 'D035281', 'D059808', 'D011198', 'D013045']","['Anthocyanins', 'Antioxidants', 'Biosynthetic Pathways', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Genotype', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Organ Specificity', 'Pigmentation', 'Pigments, Biological', 'Plant Tubers', 'Polyphenols', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Species Specificity']",Metabolite profiling of red and blue potatoes revealed cultivar and tissue specific patterns for anthocyanins and other polyphenols.,"['Q000032', 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000032', 'Q000235', None]","['analysis', 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'analysis', 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28664422,2017

28573856,"An aroma distillate was prepared by solvent extraction and subsequent SAFE distillation from Italian vine-ripe tomatoes eliciting an intense overall aroma. Application of gc/olfactometry and the aroma extract dilution analysis revealed 44 odor-active compounds, 42 of which could be identified. The highest odor activity value of 2048 was established for the green, grassy (Z)-3-hexenal, the metallic smelling trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal, the potato-like 3-(methylthio)propanal, and the caramel-like 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone. Of the further odorants, 13 compounds have previously not been reported as tomato odorants. Although most of these showed lower FD-factors, in particular, the coconut/dill-like smelling wine lactone ((3S,3aS,7aR)-3a,4,5,7a-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethylbenzofuran-2(3H)-one) appeared with a quite high FD factor. In addition, a fruity, almond-like odorant (6) with an FD factor of 1024 was detected. By application of high resolution mass spectrometry and polarity considerations, the structure of a methyl-2-ethoxytetrahydropyran isomer was suggested for 6. Four of the five possible isomers, the 3-methyl-, 4-methyl-, 5-methyl-, and 6-methyl-2-ethoxytetrahydropyran were synthesized and showed similar mass spectrometric patterns. However, these were excluded by their different retention indices. Although the synthesis of the remaining 2-methyl-2-ethoxytetrahydropyran resulted in only small yields, which were not sufficient for NMR measurements, this structure is very likely for 6. This compound was never reported as a food constituent before.

Penicillium chrysogenium has been devoted to the green synthesis of melanin whereby optimizing its culture and environmental conditions. The impacts of alternative economic L-tyrosine natural sources (unprecedented alternate origins) and gamma radiation were pledged for the potential growing of the pigment. Herein, notable increases in melanin yield (6.4mg/ml; much higher than nonoptimized one by 40 folds) was obtained by optimizing the culture, and environmental requirements [potato starch (3.0%), yeast extract (5.0%), copper sulfate (0.2mM), 0.25% L-tyrosine, 0.1% L-glycine, and 0.1% Tween 20 at pH5.0, and 30°C for 7.0days using 180.0rpm shaking speed]. The addition of banana's peel (2.0%) has been led to increase the melanin production up to (8.3mg/ml; much higher than optimized one by 1.29 folds). It stimulated the induced enzymes, (i.e., tyrosinase) because it contained significant amounts of L-tyrosine, dopamine, and L-DOPA as resources for melanin biosynthesis. Then irradiated P. chrysogenium (2.5kGy) induced the pigment yield to 10.3mg/ml; much higher than optimized one by (1.61 folds). On the other hand, we tailored a methodology involved the product of melanin and gamma rays (25.0kGy) to an eco-friendly synthesis of Bismuth oxide nanoparticles (BiONPs) at the room temperature. Melanin under such alkaline condition functioning as simultaneously hydrolyzes, photoprotection of the Bi seeds, and stabilizer against the uncontrolled growth and the free radicals attack. Whereas the gamma irradiation induced the room temperature condensation reaction to occur, a novel mechanism proposal was discussed. BiONPs were characterized by UV-Vis., DLS, XRD, SEM, EDX, and FTIR. DLS and XRD calculations with TEM analysis exhibited the mean diameter of BiONPs was 29.82nm. Moreover, the as-prepared BiONPs presented a unique antimicrobial activity against some oral, standard ATCC, and multidrug resistant microbes with ultralow concentrations (0.8μg/ml). Also, the photocatalytic degradation of Tartrazine dye (TZ), under the UV-Light irradiation, reached 85.0% in 140.0min. Thereby, owing to its unique characteristics such as cost-effective and scalability method with long-term stabilization, nontoxic nature, excellent chemical inertness, biocompatibility and active properties of BiONPs can find possible purposes in the medical, dental, and cosmetic approaches.","Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether polyphenol oxidase (PPO), an important eggplant enzyme, acts as an allergen. The proteins of eggplant peel extract were separated on phenyl-Sepharose (PS), and analyzed by skin prick test (SPT), ELISA and IgE-immunoblotting; the components were analyzed for PPO activity, presence of protein-bound copper, and recognition by rabbit polyclonal anti-sweet potato PPO antiserum. LC-MS/MS and in silico analysis were employed to identify the separated allergens and prediction of IgE epitopes. Eggplant allergens were separated into 5 components (PS1-PS5), of which component PS2 exhibited high specific PPO activity. SPT and ELISA with PPO-rich pool (PS2) were positive in all 6 eggplant-allergic subjects; the 43, 64 and 71kDa proteins displayed strong IgE-binding ability.

Previous work has shown that these permeates contribute to salty taste without contributing significantly to sodium content. The objective of this study was to explore the sensory characteristics and compositional analysis of permeates from different milk and whey streams and a low-sodium product application made from them. Skim milk, Cheddar, cottage, and Mozzarella cheese whey permeates were manufactured in triplicate, and delactosed whey permeate was obtained in triplicate. Composition (protein, fat, solids, minerals) was conducted on permeates. Organic acid composition was determined using HPLC. Volatile compounds were extracted from permeates by solid phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A trained sensory panel documented sensory attributes of permeates and cream of broccoli soups with and without salt or permeates followed by consumer acceptance testing (n=105) on the soups. Cottage cheese whey permeate contained a higher lactic acid content than other permeates, which has been shown to contribute to a higher salty taste. Cottage cheese whey permeate also contained potato or brothy and caramel flavors and sour and salty tastes, whereas delactosed whey permeate had high intensities of cardboard and beefy or brothy flavors and salty taste. Milk, Cheddar, and Mozzarella cheese whey permeates were characterized by sweet taste and cooked milky flavor. Permeates with higher cardboard flavor had higher levels of aldehydes. All permeates contributed to salty taste and to salty taste perception in soups; although the control soup with added salt was perceived as saltier and was preferred by consumers over permeate soups. Soup with permeate from cottage cheese was the least liked of all soups, likely due to its sour taste. All other permeate soups scored at parity for liking.

A proper risk assessment of those substances requires the availability of robust occurrence data; in this respect concerns have been raised regarding the reliability of results obtained with the currently available methods to determine those substances in processed food. This article presents an indirect analytical procedure for the simultaneous determination of 3-MCPDEs, 2-MCPDEs and GEs in a wide variety of food products after extraction by pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) and determination by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). For the differentiation of MCPDEs and GEs, the latter were first converted to monobromopropanediol esters (MBPDEs) in acid aqueous solution of sodium bromide. MCPDEs and MBPDEs were then hydrolysed under acidic conditions followed by derivatisation of the released free (non-esterified) form in ethyl acetate with phenyl boronic acid (PBA). Quantification of the analytes was carried out using the isotopic labelled analogues of both MCPDEs and GEs. Limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) were in the range of 7-17mgkg(-1) and 13-31mgkg(-1) respectively, while the working range of the method was between LOQ and 1850mgkg(-1) expressed on fat basis.

The procedure involved extraction of the rodenticides from samples with acetone, followed by liquid-liquid partitioning with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and 10% sodium chloride aqueous solution, then cleanup using GPC, and finally, analysis using LC-MS/MS. High recoveries from the GPC column were obtained for all rodenticides tested using a mobile phase of acetone/cyclohexane/triethylamine (400:1600:1, v/v/v). An ODS column, which contains low levels of metal impurities, gave satisfactory peak shapes for both hydroxycoumarin- and indandione-type rodenticides in the LC-MS/MS separation. The average recoveries of rodenticides from eight agricultural foods (apple, eggplant, cabbage, orange, potato, tomato, brown rice, and soybean) fortified at 0.0005-0.001 mg/kg ranged from 76 to 116%, except for bromadiolone in orange (53%) and diphacinone in soybean (54%), and the relative standard deviations ranged from 1 to 16%.

It is, however, significantly sensitive to a number of soil-borne pathogens that affect roots and tubers, causing considerable economic losses. So far, most research on potato has been dedicated to tubers and hence little attention has been paid to root structure and function. Methods In the present study we characterized root border cells using histochemical staining, immunofluorescence labelling of cell wall polysaccharides epitopes and observation using laser confocal microscopy. The monosaccharide composition of the secreted exudates was determined by gas chromatography of trimethylsilyl methylglycoside derivatives. The effects of root exudates and secreted arabinogalactan proteins on bacterial growth were investigated using in vitro bioassays. Key Results Root exudate from S. tuberosum was highly enriched in galactose-containing molecules including arabinogalactan proteins as major components. Treatment of the root with an elicitor derived from Pectobacterium atrosepticum, a soil-borne pathogen of potato, altered the composition of the exudates and arabinogalactan proteins. We found that the growth of the bacterium in vitro was differentially affected by exudates from elicited and non-elicited roots (i.e. inhibition versus stimulation). Conclusions Taken together, these findings indicate that galactose-containing polymers of potato root exudates play a central role in root-microbe interactions.",Annals of botany,[],[],Root exudate of Solanum tuberosum is enriched in galactose-containing molecules and impacts the growth of Pectobacterium atrosepticum.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27390353,2020

Coumaric, ferulic and caffeic acid derivatives were revealed to be the major phenolic constituents. All-trans-β-carotene was the major carotenoid (17-38 μg g(-1), dry basis), but all-trans-lutein and 9-cis-β-carotene were also identified. The peel and pulp presented <2 μg per mL of tocopherols, and ascorbic acid was not detected. The whole fruit extract exhibited scavenging capacity against all tested ROS and RNS (IC50 = 14-461 μg mL(-1)) with high antioxidant efficiency against HOCl. Thus, Solanum diploconos fruits may be seen as a promising source of bioactive compounds with high antioxidant potential against the most physiologically relevant ROS and RNS.

To investigate this type of adulteration, this study used shotgun proteomics analyses by MS(E) (multiplexed, low- and high-collision energy, data-independent acquisition) of WP-based supplements. Seventeen WP-based supplement samples were evaluated. Chicken, maize, rice, potato, soybean, and wheat proteins were considered as probable sources of bovine whey adulteration. Collectively, 523 proteins were identified across all 16 samples and replicates, with 94% of peptides inside a normal distribution within 10ppm of maximum error. In 10 of the 16 samples analyzed, only proteins from bovine whey could be detected, while in the other samples several other protein sources were detected in high concentrations, especially soybean, wheat, and rice.

Potato is an important food commodity that needs large inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. To overcome high fertilizer demand (especially nitrogen), five bacteria, i.e., Azospirillum sp. TN10, Agrobacterium sp. TN14, Pseudomonas sp. TN36, Enterobacter sp. TN38 and Rhizobium sp. TN42 were isolated from the potato rhizosphere on nitrogen-free malate medium and identified based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Three strains, i.e., TN10, TN38, and TN42 showed nitrogen fixation (92.67-134.54 nmol h(-1)mg(-1) protein), while all showed the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which was significantly increased by the addition of L-tryptophan. Azospirillum sp. TN10 produced the highest amount of IAA, as measured by spectrophotometry (312.14 μg mL(-1)) and HPLC (18.3 μg mL(-1)). Inoculation with these bacteria under axenic conditions resulted in differential growth responses of potato. Azospirillum sp. TN10 incited the highest increase in potato fresh and dry weight over control plants, along with increased N contents of shoot and roots. All strains were able to colonize and maintain their population densities in the potato rhizosphere for up to 60 days, with Azospirillum sp. and Rhizobium sp. showing the highest survival. Plant root colonization potential was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy of root sections inoculated with Azospirillum sp. TN10. Of the five test strains, Azospirillum sp. TN10 has the greatest potential to increase the growth and nitrogen uptake of potato.

Objective The current study explores scientific validation for this traditional medication. Materials and methods We used ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazil (DPPH) assays to estimate antioxidant activity of P. guajava leaf extracts (methanol, hexane and chloroform). Antitumour and in vivo cytotoxic activities were determined using potato disc assay (PDA) and brine shrimp lethality assay, respectively. Three human carcinoma cell lines (KBM5, SCC4 and U266) were incubated with different doses (10-100 μg/mL) of extracts and the anticancer activity was estimated by MTT assay. NF-κB suppressing activity was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Chemical composition of the three extracts was identified by GC-MS. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were measured by colorimetric assays. Results and discussions The order of antioxidant activity of three extracts was methanol > chloroform > hexane. The IC50 values ranged from 22.73 to 51.65 μg/mL for KBM5; 22.82 to 70.25 μg/mL for SCC4 and 20.97 to 89.55 μg/mL for U266 cells. The hexane extract exhibited potent antitumour (IC50  value = 65.02 μg/mL) and cytotoxic (LC50  value = 32.18 μg/mL) activities. This extract also completely inhibited the TNF-α induced NF-κB activation in KBM5 cells. GC-MS results showed that pyrogallol, palmitic acid and vitamin E were the major components of methanol, chloroform and hexane extracts. We observed significant (p < 0.05) difference in total phenolic and flavonoid contents of different solvent extracts.

Simple, cost-effective, and sensitive methods for the rapid detection of AA are needed to ensure food safety. Herein, a novel colorimetric method was proposed for the visual detection of AA based on a nucleophile-initiated thiol-ene Michael addition reaction. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were aggregated by glutathione (GSH) because of a ligand-replacement, accompanied by a color change from red to purple. In the presence of AA, after the thiol-ene Michael addition reaction between GSH and AA with the catalysis of a nucleophile, the sulfhydryl group of GSH was consumed by AA, which hindered the subsequent ligand-replacement and the aggregation of AuNPs. Therefore, the concentration of AA could be determined by the visible color change caused by dispersion/aggregation of AuNPs. This new method showed high sensitivity with a linear range from 0.1 μmol L(-1) to 80 μmol L(-1) and a detection limit of 28.6 nmol L(-1), and especially revealed better selectivity than the fluorescence sensing method reported previously.

The total of nine carotenoids was analysed by HPLC using a C30 column and PDA detection. The total carotenoid content for all cultivars ranged from 1.44 to 40.13 μg/g DM. Yellow cultivars showed a much higher average total carotenoid content (26.22 μg/g DM) when compared to red/purple-fleshed potatoes (5.69 μg/g DM). Yellow cultivars were dominated by antheraxanthin, whereas neoxanthin was the main carotenoid in red/purple cultivars. Thermal processing significantly impacted all potato cultivars. Boiling decreased the total carotenoids by 92% compared to baking (88%). Lutein was the most stable carotenoid against thermal processing (decreased by 24-43%) followed by β-carotene (decreased by 78-83%); other carotenoids were degraded nearly completely.

26479897,"The applicability of liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) for the quantitative analysis of pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits was demonstrated. The LC-QTOF-MS parameters, such as cone voltage, capillary voltage, collision energy and mass extraction window, were carefully optimised for the analysis of pesticide residues. The LC-QTOF-MS method was validated for 149 pesticides in four vegetables and fruits, i.e. apple, potato, cabbage and spinach, at a spiking level of 0.01 mg kg(-1). The samples were prepared according to the Japanese official multi-residue method with a modification to the column clean-up procedure. Of the 149 pesticides, recoveries in the range of 70-120% were achieved for 147 pesticides in apple, 145 in potato, 141 in cabbage and 131 in spinach, with intra-day precisions (RSDs) of < 25% and inter-day precisions (RSDs) of < 30%, which are within the acceptable range given in the Japanese method validation guideline. Matrix effects were negligible for the majority of the target pesticides. Except for spiroxamine in spinach, no interfering peaks were observed in the blank samples. The target pesticides, except those with low sensitivity, achieved calibration curves with satisfactory linearity, with correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.995 in the concentration range of 0.002-0.1 μg ml(-1). Furthermore, the majority of the target pesticides provided more than one fragment ion or isotope ion that could be used for confirmation. The overall results suggest that LC-QTOF-MS is a powerful tool for the quantification of pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits at the level of 0.01 mg kg(-1). ","Food additives & contaminants.

Tamluk Mitha) essential oil (BLEO) and modelling its effect on growth of Penicillium expansum on semi-synthetic medium. Gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) analysis of BLEO revealed the presence of different bioactive phenolic compounds in significant amounts. Among 46 different components identified, chavibetol (22.0%), estragole (15.8%), β-cubebene (13.6%), chavicol (11.8%), and caryophyllene (11.3%) were found to be the major compounds of BLEO. A disc diffusion and disc volatilization method were used to evaluate antifungal activity of the oil against a selected food spoilage mould. The logistic model was used to study the kinetics of spore germination. Prediction and validation of antifungal effect of BLEO was performed on semi-synthetic medium (apple juice agar) using predictive microbiological tools. The Baranyi and Roberts model was used to estimate maximum growth rate (μmax in mm/day) and apparent lag time (λ in days) of the mould. Secondary modelling was performed using a re-parameterized Monod-type equation based on cardinal values to study the effect of different BLEO concentration on estimated growth parameters. Emax (minimum concentration of oil at which mould growth was inhibited) and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration of BLEO at which lag time is infinite) value of BLEO against P. expansum was estimated to be 0.56 and 0.74 μl/ml, respectively, which was found to be similar on potato dextrose agar (PDA) as well as apple juice agar (AJA) medium. The correlation between estimated growth parameters of the mould on both the media was obtained with satisfactory statistical indices (R(2) and RMSE).

26286222,"Phosphorus (P) is an important element for crop productivity and is widely applied in fertilizers. Most P fertilizers applied to land are sorbed onto soil particles, so research on improving plant uptake of less easily available P is important. In the current study, we investigated the responses in root morphology and root-exuded organic acids (OAs) to low available P (1 μM P) and sufficient P (50 μM P) in barley, canola and micropropagated seedlings of potato-three important food crops with divergent root traits, using a hydroponic plant growth system. We hypothesized that the dicots canola and tuber-producing potato and the monocot barley would respond differently under various P availabilities. WinRHIZO and liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry results suggested that under low P availability, canola developed longer roots and exhibited the fastest root exudation rate for citric acid. Barley showed a reduction in root length and root surface area and an increase in root-exuded malic acid under low-P conditions. Potato exuded relatively small amounts of OAs under low P, while there was a marked increase in root tips. Based on the results, we conclude that different crops show divergent morphological and physiological responses to low P availability, having evolved specific traits of root morphology and root exudation that enhance their P-uptake capacity under low-P conditions. These results could underpin future efforts to improve P uptake of the three crops that are of importance for future sustainable crop production.

The major staple diet in South Asia, rice, was chosen to study its interaction with UO2(2+), the active uranium species in water, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Highest uptake limit was checked by cooking rice at very high uranium concentration and it was found to be good scavenger of uranium. To gain insight into the mechanism of uptake, direct interaction of UO2(2+) with monosaccharides was also studied, using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry taking mannose as a model. The studies have been done with dissolved uranium salt, uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UO2(NO3)2·6H2O), as well as the leachate of a stable oxide of uranium, UO2(s), both of which exist as UO2(2+) in water. Among the eight different rice varieties investigated, Karnataka Ponni showed the maximum uranium uptake whereas unpolished Basmati rice showed the minimum. Interaction with other foodstuffs (potato, carrot, peas, kidney beans and lentils) with and without NaCl affected the extent of chemical interaction but was not consistent with the carbohydrate content. Uranium interaction with D-mannose monitored through ESI-MS, under optimized instrumental parameters, identified the peaks corresponding to uranyl adduct with mannose monomer, dimer and trimer and the species were confirmed by MS/MS studies. The product ion mass spectra showed peaks illustrating water loss from the parent ion as the collision energy was increased, an evidence for the strong interaction of uranium with mannose. This study would constitute the essential background for understanding interaction of uranium with various foods.

Our objective was to evaluate the use of a portable infrared instrument for the rapid quantitation of major sugars and amino acids in raw potato tubers using single-bounce attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and dial path accessories as an alternative to time-consuming chromatographic techniques. Samples representing a total of 84 experimental and commercial potato varieties harvested in two consecutive growing seasons (2012 and 2013) were used in this study. Samples had wide ranges of sugars determined by HPLC-RID (non-detectable (ND)-7.7 mg glucose, ND-9.4 mg fructose and 0.4-5.4 mg sucrose per 1 g fresh weight), and asparagine and glutamine levels determined by GC-FID (0.7-2.9 mg and 0.3-1.7 mg per 1 g fresh weight). Infrared spectra collected from 64 varieties were used to create partial least squares regression (PLSR) calibration models that predicted the sugar and amino acid levels in an independent set of 16 validation potato varieties. Excellent linear correlations between infrared predicted and reference values were obtained. PLSR models had a high correlation coefficient of prediction (rPred >0.95) and residual predictive deviation (RPD) values ranging between 3.1 and 5.5.

The sample preparation procedure was carefully optimized for the efficient removal of co-extracted matrix components. The method involves extraction of acidic pesticides with acetonitrile containing hydrochloric acid, removal of water from crude extract by salting out, and sequential cleanup by octadecylsilyl silica gel and silica gel columns. For samples containing high amounts of pigments, such as spinach, additional cleanup using a graphitized carbon column was performed prior to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Recovery tests were performed for five times for each sample of cabbage, spinach, potato, eggplant, orange, and apple fortified at 0.01 mg kg-1. Out of the 73 tested pesticides, 70 for cabbage, 67 for spinach, 69 for potato, 67 for eggplant, 64 for orange, and 70 for apple were within the range of 70-120%, with relative standard deviations below 25%. Nitenpyram and pyrasulfotole showed low recoveries for all the samples tested, probably due to low recoveries from silica gel column. The developed method effectively removed co-extracted matrix components and was highly selective, with no interfering peaks found in the chromatograms of blank samples.

At the end of digestion, acrylamide reduction was between 49.2% and 73.4% in biscuits. Binary model systems composed of acrylamide and amino acids were used to understand the mechanism of acrylamide reduction. High-resolution mass spectrometry analyses confirmed Michael addition of amino acids to acrylamide during digestion. In contrast to bakery products, acrylamide levels increased significantly during gastric digestion of fried potatoes.

Fourier transform infrared spectra showed the increase of a carbonyl (C = O) peak at 1701 cm(-1) and a decrease in the intensity of the absorption at 3400 cm(-1) (O-H stretching) in cAOB-o. Acylation was inferred to mainly occur on the hydroxyl groups of flavones C-glycosides according to the change of high-performance liquid chromatography spectra and the contents of total flavonoids and phenolic acids. cAOB-o with the addition of 0.02% significantly increased oxidative stability of palm oil 1.59 times, lard 3.74 times, and fried potato chips 2.08 times, which was better than the effect of oil-soluble tea polyphenol (P < 0.01).

In this study, The identification ability of optical spectroscopy techniques, including near-infrared (NIR) Raman spectroscopy and NIR fluorescence spectroscopy, for invasive detection of potato cultivars was evaluated. A rapid NIR Raman spectroscopy system was applied to measure the composite Raman and NIR fluorescence spectroscopy of 3 different species of potatoes (98 samples in total) under 785 nm laser light excitation. Then pure Raman and NIR fluorescence spectroscopy were abstracted from the composite spectroscopy, respectively. At last, the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was utilized to analyze and classify Raman spectra of 3 different types of potatoes. All the samples were divided into two sets at random: the calibration set (74samples) and prediction set (24 samples), the model was validated using a leave-one-out, cross-validation method. The results showed that both the NIR-excited fluorescence spectra and pure Raman spectra could be used to identify three cultivars of potatoes. The fluorescence spectrum could distinguish the Favorita variety well (sensitivity: 1, specificity: 0.86 and accuracy: 0.92), but the result for Diamant (sensitivity: 0.75, specificity: 0.75 and accuracy: 0. 75) and Granola (sensitivity: 0.16, specificity: 0.89 and accuracy: 0.71) cultivars identification were a bit poorer.

They were compared with controls stored in the same conditions. Three different inoculation time courses were employed in order to obtain diseased potatoes showing clear signs of advanced infection (for standard detection) and diseased potatoes with no apparent evidence of infection (for early detection). A total of 156 samples were processed by PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and k-means clustering. Results show a clear discrimination between controls and diseased potatoes for all experiments with no difference among observations from standard and early detection.

However, when consumed they can cause intoxication, especially in humans. Therefore, effective quantitative methods for assessing the dietary exposure of this toxic fungal metabolite are required. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the effect on the use of a bio-wipe kit, which is a faecal material collection kit, to detect the presence of FB1. Faecal materials were collected from a rural farming community in Gauteng Province, South Africa. In total, 200 samples of faecal material were analysed for Fusarium species using a serial dilution method, while FB1 was further analysed and quantified by reversed-phase TLC and HPLC. The study showed the presence of 11 different Fusarium species grown on potato dextrose agar culture medium of which F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, producers of FB1, and F. oxysporum were the dominant species. Fumonisin B1 was recorded at an incidence rate of 65% of the total using TLC. Results from HPLC showed that 84% were positive at different ranges of concentration for FB1.

Potatoes are a major component of the human diet and contain CGA, but little is known about their abundance in these important tubers. We therefore used a rapid, sensitive, and selective method for quantifying CGAs in food using ultra-high performance LC diode array detection (UHPLC-DAD). We also established an optimized sample preparation protocol based on ultrafiltration and used these techniques to quantify the CGA contents of selected potato varieties (fresh and after storage) and potato products. The measured CGA concentrations in potato skins were 37-636 mg/100 g dry weight (DW) and were three to four times greater than those in the flesh. Storage reduced the CGA levels in potatoes by up to 81%. The studied potato purees contained 4-11 mg CGA/100 g DW. In addition, the quinic acid contents of potato flesh (11-95 mg/100 g DW) and puree (11-22 mg/100 g DW) were measured using stable isotope dilution analysis.

Effect of different process parameters, namely, PEG, potassium phosphate buffer, NaCl concentration, and pH of the system, on partition coefficient, purification factor, and yield of PPO enzyme were evaluated. Response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized as a statistical tool for the optimization of ATPS. Optimized experimental conditions were found to be PEG1500 17.62% (w/w), potassium phosphate buffer 15.11% (w/w), and NaCl 2.08 mM at pH 7. At optimized condition, maximum partition coefficient, purification factor, and yield were found to be 3.7, 4.5, and 77.8%, respectively. After partial purification of PPO from ATPS, further purification was done by gel chromatography where its purity was increased up to 12.6-fold. The purified PPO enzyme was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by Km value 3.3 mM, and Vmax value 3333 U/mL, and enzyme stable ranges for temperature and pH of PPO were determined.

24998264,"Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a worldwide food staple, but substantial waste accompanies the cultivation of this crop due to wounding of the outer skin and subsequent unfavorable healing conditions. Motivated by both economic and nutritional considerations, this metabolite profiling study aims to improve understanding of closing layer and wound periderm formation and guide the development of new methods to ensure faster and more complete healing after skin breakage. The polar metabolites of wound-healing tissues from four potato cultivars with differing patterns of tuber skin russeting (Norkotah Russet, Atlantic, Chipeta, and Yukon Gold) were analyzed at three and seven days after wounding, during suberized closing layer formation and nascent wound periderm development, respectively. The polar extracts were assessed using LC-MS and NMR spectroscopic methods, including multivariate analysis and tentative identification of 22 of the 24 biomarkers that discriminate among the cultivars at a given wound-healing time point or between developmental stages. Differences among the metabolites that could be identified from NMR- and MS-derived biomarkers highlight the strengths and limitations of each method, also demonstrating the complementarity of these approaches in terms of assembling a complete molecular picture of the tissue extracts. Both methods revealed that differences among the cultivar metabolite profiles diminish as healing proceeds during the period following wounding. The biomarkers included polyphenolic amines, flavonoid glycosides, phenolic acids and glycoalkaloids. Because wound healing is associated with oxidative stress, the free radical scavenging activities of the extracts from different cultivars were measured at each wounding time point, revealing significantly higher scavenging activity of the Yukon Gold periderm especially after 7 days of wounding.

This paper reports the isolation of colourless caffeoyl compounds from purple sweet potato using AB-8 macroresin absorption and semi-preparative HPLC-DAD. The structures of the five isolated monomers were identified as: 5-caffeoylquinic acid (1), 6-O-caffeoyl-β-d-fructofuranosyl-(2-1)-α-d-glucopyranoside (2) and trans-4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3), 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (4), 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (5), and by ESI/MS and NMR. Compounds 1, 4 and 5 were reported previously in combination with anthocyanins in purple sweet potato, whereas 2 and 3 were found for the first time.

This is the first study comparing amylose size distributions from various plant sources. Chain-length distributions (CLDs) of amylose and amylopectin branches (""fine structure"") are characterized using size-exclusion chromatography [sometimes termed gel permeation chromatography (GPC)] and parametrized by both biosynthesis-based and empirical fits, to understand the starch biosynthesis mechanism and identify associations with starch digestibility. All starches show bimodal amylose weight CLDs, varying with plant sources, with potato tuber and sweet potato root starch having relatively longer branches than the others. The digestograms of all starches fit first-order kinetics. Unlike what has been seen in cooked grains/flours, amylose and amylopectin fine structures have no association with the digestibility of freshly gelatinized starch.

First, a direct headspace GC-MS method, followed by two indirect methods on the basis of derivatization with either pentafluorophenylhydrazine (GC-MS) or 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (LC-MS/MS), was developed. All methods are also suitable for the quantitation of acrolein using the standard [¹³C₃]-acrolein. Applying these three methods on five different types of fats and oils varying in their fatty acid compositions revealed significantly varying crotonaldehyde concentrations for the different samples, but nearly identical quantitative data for all methods. Formed amounts of crotonaldehyde were dependent not only on the type of oil, e.g., 0.29-0.32 mg/kg of coconut oil or 33.9-34.4 mg/kg of linseed oil after heat-processing for 24 h at 180 °C, but also on the applied temperature and time. The results indicated that the concentration of formed crotonaldehyde seemed to be correlated with the amount of linolenic acid in the oils. Furthermore, the formation of crotonaldehyde was compared to that of its homologue acrolein, demonstrating that acrolein was always present in higher amounts in heat-processed oils, e.g., 12.3 mg of crotonaldehyde/kg of rapeseed oil in comparison to 23.4 mg of acrolein/kg after 24 h at 180 °C.

24372644,"The metabolic peculiarities of anthracene and pyrene by Pycnoporus sanguineus H1 were investigated. The fungus H1 could grow on potato dextrose agar plates with anthracene and anthraquinone as carbon sources. In liquid medium, the strain degraded 8.5% of anthracene as the sole carbon source, with no ligninolytic enzymes detected, indicating that intracellular catabolic enzymes might be responsible for the initial oxidation of anthracene. When bran was added to the medium, the degradation rate of anthracene and pyrene increased to 71.3% and 30.2%, respectively, and the laccase activities increased to a maximal value of 501.2 and 587.6 U/L, respectively. By gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, anthraquinone was detected as the unique intermediate product of anthracene oxidation, with a yield molar ratio of 0.3. In vitro experiments showed that the extracellular culture fluid containing laccase transformed anthracene to anthraquinone with a yield molar ratio of 1.0, which was less than that of the in vivo experiment, indicating that anthraquinone could be further metabolized by the strain.

Pesticide residues in 10 g of homogenized agricultural products were extracted with 30 mL of acetonitrile and salted out with 4 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and 1 g of sodium chloride in the presence of citrate salts for buffering in a disposable tube. Co-extractives were removed by use of our original triple layered column (C18/GC/PSA; 60/30/60 mg). According to the method validation guideline of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, we conducted recovery tests in 5 kinds of agricultural products (brown rice, kiwi, cabbage, sweet potato and spinach) spiked with 60 pesticides at the level of 0.01 or 0.1 μg/g. Each concentration of pesticide spiked was extracted from 2 samples per day on 5 days. Pesticides in the test solution were determined by two types of LC-MS/MS using scheduled MRM.

24274280,"Acrylamide in food has drawn worldwide attention since 2002 due to its neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects. These influences brought out the dual polar and non-polar characters of acrylamide as they enabled it to dissolve in aqueous blood medium or penetrate the non-polar plasma membrane. In the current work, a simple HPLC/UV system was used to reveal that the penetration of acrylamide in non-polar phase was stronger than its dissolution in polar phase. The presence of phosphate salts in the polar phase reduced the acrylamide interaction with the non-polar phase. Furthermore, an eco-friendly and costless coupling of the HPLC/UV with ionic liquid based ultrasonic assisted extraction (ILUAE) was developed to determine the acrylamide content in food samples. ILUAE was proposed for the efficient extraction of acrylamide from bread and potato chips samples. The extracts were obtained by soaking of potato chips and bread samples in 1.5 mol L(-1) 1-butyl-3-methylimmidazolium bromide (BMIMBr) for 30.0 and 60.0 min, respectively and subsequent chromatographic separation within 12.0 min using Luna C18 column and 100% water mobile phase with 0.5 mL min(-1) under 25 °C column temperature at 250 nm. The extraction and analysis of acrylamide could be achieved within 2h. The mean extraction efficiency of acrylamide showed adequate repeatability with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 4.5%. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation were 25.0 and 80.0 ng mL(-1), respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was tested by recovery in seven food samples giving values ranged between 90.6% and 109.8%. Therefore, the methodology was successfully validated by official guidelines, indicating its reliability to be applied to analysis of real samples, proven to be useful for its intended purpose.

24252761,"Acrylamide is a neurotoxin and potential carcinogen, but is found in various thermally processed foods such as potato chips, biscuits, and coffee. Simple and sensitive methods for on-line detection of acrylamide are needed to ensure food safety. In this paper, a novel fluorescent sensing method based on acrylamide polymerization-induced distance increase between quantum dots (QDs) was proposed for detecting acrylamide in potato chips. The functional QDs were prepared by their binding with N-acryloxysuccinimide (NAS), which was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FR-IR) spectra. The carbon-carbon double bonds of NAS modified QDs polymerized with assistance of photo initiator under UV irradiation, leading to QDs getting closer along with fluorescence intensity decreasing. Acrylamide in the sample participated in the polymerization and induced an increase of fluorescence intensity. This method possessed a linear range from 3.5×10(-5) to 3.5 g L(-1) (r(2)=0.94) and a limit of detection of 3.5×10(-5) g L(-1).

24013513,"A series of 695 food crops were collected on 539 soils throughout Belgium. All samples were collected on commercial production fields, omitting private gardens. All crops were analyzed for their selenium (Se) concentration. The soils represent different soil types occurring in Belgium, with soil textures ranging from sand to silt loam, and including a few clay soils. They were analyzed for Se concentration, organic carbon content, cation exchange capacity and extractable sulphur (S) concentration. The Se concentrations in the soils were low (range 0.14-0.70 mg kg(-1) dw), but increasing soil Se concentrations were observed with increasing clay content. Stepwise multiple regressions were applied to determine relations between Se concentrations in crops and soil characteristics. Among field crops, wheat is the most important accumulator of selenium but the concentration remains rather low on the Belgian low Se-soils. Based on dry weight, leafy vegetables contain more Se than wheat. The soil is the most important source of Se and the element is transported with the water stream to the leaves, where it is accumulated. Vegetables rich in S, e.g. some Brassica and Allium species, have a higher capacity to accumulate Se as it can replace S in the proteins, although this accumulation is still limited at low soil Se concentrations. In loamy soils, weak correlations were found between the soil Se concentration and its concentration in wheat and potato. The uptake of Se increased with increasing pH. The Se concentrations in Belgian soils are far too low to generate a driving force on Se uptake. General climatic conditions such as temperature, air humidity and soil moisture are also important for the transfer of Se within the plant, and plant linked factors such as cultivar, growth stage and edible part are important as well, although their influence remains limited at low soil Se concentrations.",The Science of the total environment,"['D000704', 'D001530', 'D018556', 'D004784', 'D013058', 'D012643', 'D012987']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Belgium', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Selenium', 'Soil']",Selenium content of Belgian cultivated soils and its uptake by field crops and vegetables.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000706', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'statistics & numerical data', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24013513,2014

Metal monitoring in food, like sweet potatoes, provides basic information on safety aspects in regulatory processes as well as nutritional values. One hundred five samples of three varieties of sweet potatoes were randomly obtained from supermarkets, farmers markets, and farmers' plots in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). The edible portion (pulp) was the only part considered for analysis. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine the contents of sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn), while the levels of chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The mean concentrations were 500 Na, 4409 K, 564 Ca, 609 Mg, 1.291 Cu, 6.554 Fe, 2.324 Mn, 2.348 Zn, 0.028 Cr, 0.048 Ni, 0.001 Cd, and 0.003 Pb mg/kg, respectively. Potassium presented the highest contents in all varieties of sweet potatoes. Iron was the most abundant microelement. The orange fleshed sweet potato variety offered greater nutritional contributions to the recommended intakes than the rest of the varieties studied. The estimated mean daily intake of Ni (0.72 mg/day) detected in our samples was highly consistent with other studies. Average daily intakes of Cd (0.015 μg/day) and Pb (0.045 μg/day) were below toxicological reference values.

23909659,"Potatoes from Galicia (northwestern Spain) are subjected to a Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) according to European legislation. Ten trace elements (Li, Na, K, Rb, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Cu, and Zn) have been determined by atomic spectrometry in two sets of potato samples: Geo-Origin.set and Variety.set. The first data set is composed of samples of the only variety authorized by PGI (Kennebec) with two geographical origins: Galician and non-Galician. The second set corresponds to samples from different varieties but with only Galician geographical origin. Chemometric pattern recognition techniques have been applied to the study of potato geographical and varietal origins in relation to their capability for translocating metals from soil to tuber. Also, authentication models for classifying potato samples with Galician PGI based on metal fingerprints have been developed. The results obtained showed that samples of the same variety, Kennebec, have different metal fingerprints when they have been produced in different geographic locations. Also, diverse potato varieties cultivated on equal geographic Galician origin presented different metal profiles as well. Therefore, it can be concluded that classification studies on the differentiation of geographical origin of foods should take into account information of production area together with varietal data. Otherwise, classification obtained on the basis of the geographical origin could be due to the different variety or vice versa. Finally, two models were constructed for Kennebec Galician samples against Kennebec from other origins as well as against other varieties cultivated in Galicia (Liseta and Baraka). Both models achieved adequate classification rates (93-100%), good sensitivities, and total specificities (100%), allowing the fraud detection in the PGI label.

In this context, the objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the presence of fungi and mycotoxins (aflatoxins and cyclopiazonic acid) in 110 stored samples of cultivated Brazil nut (55 samples of nuts and 55 samples of shells) collected monthly for 11 months in Itacoatiara, State of Amazonas, Brazil. The samples were inoculated in duplicate onto Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus agar and potato dextrose agar for the detection of fungi, and the presence of mycotoxins was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The most prevalent fungi in nuts and shells were Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., and Penicillium spp. A polyphasic approach was used for identification of Aspergillus species. Aflatoxins and cyclopiazonic acid were not detected in any of the samples analyzed. The low water activity of the substrate was a determinant factor for the presence of fungi and the absence of aflatoxin in Brazil nut samples.

The main objective of this research was to develop regression models to predict the concentration of cadmium in 9-vegetable species: zucchini, tomato, cabbage, onion, potato, carrot, red beet, endive and chicory, based on soil properties. Soil samples were collected from 123 home gardens of the Municipality of Celje and 59 of these gardens were also included in vegetable sampling. The concentration of elements (e.g. arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc) in the samples was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Single (for cabbage, potato, red beet and chicory) and multiple (for tomato, onion, carrot and endive) linear regression models were developed. There was no statistically significant regression model for zucchini. The most significant parameter for the influencing the cadmium concentration in vegetables was the concentration of cadmium in soil. Other important soil properties were the content of organic matter, pH-value and the concentration of manganese.

To evaluate the model specificity, 80 adulterated LRP samples prepared by blending pure LRP with different levels of four cheaper and commonly used starches were measured and predicted. For multivariate quality models, two class modeling methods, the traditional soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) and a recently proposed partial least squares class model (PLSCM) were used. Different data preprocessing techniques, including smoothing, taking derivative and standard normal variate (SNV) transformation were used to improve the classification performance. The results indicate that smoothing, taking second-order derivatives and SNV can improve the class models by enhancing signal-to-noise ratio, reducing baseline and background shifts. The most accurate and stable models were obtained with SNV spectra for both SIMCA (sensitivity 0.909 and specificity 0.938) and PLSCM (sensitivity 0.909 and specificity 0.925). Moreover, both SIMCA and PLSCM could detect LRP samples mixed with 5% (w/w) or more other cheaper starches, including cassava, sweet potato, potato and maize starches.

23849637,"Sour cream is a widely popular acidified dairy product. Volatile compounds and organic acids and their specific contributions to flavor or acceptance have not been established, nor has a comprehensive study been conducted to characterize drivers of liking for sour cream. The objective of this study was to characterize chemical and sensory properties of sour cream and to determine the drivers of liking for sour cream. Descriptive sensory and instrumental analyses followed by consumer testing were conducted. Flavor and texture attributes of 32 (22 full-fat, 6 reduced-fat, and 4 fat-free) commercial sour creams were evaluated by a trained descriptive sensory panel. Percent solids, percent fat, pH, titratable acidity, and colorimetric measurements were conducted to characterize physical properties of sour creams. Organic acids were evaluated by HPLC and volatile aroma active compounds were evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with gas chromatography-olfactometry. Consumer acceptance testing (n=201) was conducted on selected sour creams, followed by external preference mapping. Full-fat sour creams were characterized by the lack of surface gloss and chalky textural attributes, whereas reduced-fat and fat-free samples displayed high intensities of these attributes. Full-fat sour creams were higher in cooked/milky and milk fat flavors than the reduced-fat and fat-free samples. Reduced-fat and fat-free sour creams were characterized by cardboard, acetaldehyde/green, and potato flavors, bitter taste, and astringency. Lactic acid was the prominent organic acid in all sour creams, followed by acetic and citric acids. High aroma-impact volatile compounds in sour creams were 2,3-butanedione, acetic acid, butyric acid, octanal, 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, 1-octene-3-one, and acetaldehyde. Positive drivers of liking for sour cream were milk fat, cooked/milky and sweet aromatic flavors, opacity, color intensity, and adhesiveness. This comprehensive study established sensory and instrumental properties of sour creams and their relationship to consumer acceptance.

This dataset is by far the largest ever compiled relating to acrylamide levels in potato crisps. Analysis of variance was applied to the data and showed a clear, significant downward trend for mean levels of acrylamide, from 763 ± 91.1 ng g⁻¹ (parts per billion) in 2002 to 358 ± 2.5 ng g⁻¹ in 2011; this was a decrease of 53% ± 13.5%. The yearly 95th quantile values were also subject to a clear downward trend. The effect of seasonality arising from the influence of potato storage on acrylamide levels was evident, with acrylamide in the first 6 months of the year being significantly higher than in the second 6 months. The proportion of samples containing acrylamide at a level above the indicative value of 1000 ng g⁻¹ for potato crisps introduced by the European Commission in 2011 fell from 23.8% in 2002 to 3.2% in 2011.

23768188,"Phenolics are widespread dietary antioxidants. Among these, chlorogenic acids (CGAs) received considerable attention for their wide distribution and part of human diet with potential biological effects. CGAs (71 compounds), being esters of derivatives of cinnamic acids with quinic acid are widely distributed in plant materials. Coffee is among the highest found in plants, ranging from 4 to 14%. Besides, these are reported in plant foods such as apples, pears, carrot, tomato, sweet potato, Phyllostachys edulis, oilseeds, Prunus domestica L, cherries, and eggplant. The traditional Chinese medicinal plants such as flowers and buds of Lonicera japonica Thunb and the leaves of Eucommia ulmodies contained CGAs as bioactive compound. These play an important role in the formation of roasted coffee flavor and have a marked influence on coffee cup quality. CGAs are considered as main precursors of coffee flavor and pigments. Recent technological advancements in the separation and purification of CGAs such as molecular-imprinted polymer technique; microwave-assisted extraction; pH gradient counter current chromatography has also been described.

Feeding tests with CPB larvae reared on three solanaceous plants (potato, eggplant and tomato) resulted in variable larval growth rates and differential susceptibility to Bacillus thuringiensis Cry3Aa toxin as a function of the host plant. An inverse correlation with toxicity was observed in Cry3Aa proteolytic patterns generated by CPB midgut brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from Solanaceae-fed larvae, being the toxin most extensively proteolyzed on potato, followed by eggplant and tomato. We found that CPB cysteine proteases intestains may interact with Cry3Aa toxin and, in CPB BBMV from larvae fed all three Solanaceae, the toxin was able to compete for the hydrolysis of a papain substrate. In response to treatment with the JA-dependent plant inducer Hexanoic acid (Hx), we showed that eggplant reduced OPDA basal levels and both, potato and eggplant induced JA-Ile.

23332857,"Previous studies have established that whey protein manufacture unit operations influence the flavor of dried whey proteins. Additionally, manufacturers generally instantize whey protein isolate (WPI; ≥ 90% protein) by agglomeration with lecithin to increase solubility and wettability. Whey protein isolate is often subjected to additional postprocessing steps in beverage manufacturing, including acidification and heat treatment. These postprocessing treatments may further influence formation or release of flavors. The objective of the first study was to characterize the effect of 2 processing steps inherent to manufacturing of acidic protein beverages (acidification and heat treatment) on the flavor of non-instant WPI. The second study sought to determine the effect of lecithin agglomeration, a common form of instantized (INST) WPI used in beverage manufacturing, on the flavor of WPI after acidification and heat treatment. In the first experiment, commercial non-instantized (NI) WPI were rehydrated and evaluated as is (control); acidified to pH 3.2; heated to 85°C for 5 min in a benchtop high temperature, short time (HTST) pasteurizer; or acidified to 3.2 and heated to 85°C for 30s (AH-HTST). In the second experiment, INST and NI commercial WPI were subsequently evaluated as control, acidified, heated, or AH-HTST. All samples were evaluated by descriptive sensory analysis, solid-phase microextraction (SPME), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Acidification of NI WPI produced higher concentrations of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and sensory detection of potato/brothy flavors, whereas heating increased cooked/sulfur flavors. Acidification and heating increased cardboard, potato/brothy, and malty flavors and produced higher concentrations of aldehydes, ketones, and sulfur compounds. Differences between INST and NI WPI existed before treatment; INST WPI displayed cucumber flavors not present in NI WPI. After acidification, INST WPI were distinguished by higher intensity of cucumber flavor and higher concentrations of E-2-nonenal. No perceivable differences were observed between INST and NI WPI after heating; sulfur and eggy flavors increased in both types of WPI. After treatment, AH-INST-HTST samples were differentiated from AH-NI-HTST by grassy/hay and grainy flavor and increased lipid oxidation products.

Starch contributes to the physicochemical attributes of food products made from roots, legumes, cereals, and fruits. It occurs naturally as distinct particles, called granules. Most starch granules are a mixture of 2 sugar polymers: a highly branched polysaccharide named amylopectin and a basically linear polysaccharide named amylose. The starch contained in food products undergoes changes during processing, which causes changes in the starch molecular weight and amylose to amylopectin ratio. The objective of this study was to develop a new, simple, 1-step, and accurate method for simultaneous determination of amylose and amylopectin ratio as well as weight-averaged molecular weights of starch in food products. Starch from bread flour, canned peas, corn flake cereal, snack crackers, canned kidney beans, pasta, potato chips, and white bread was extracted by dissolving in KOH, urea, and precipitation with ethanol. Starch samples were solubilized and analyzed on a high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) system. To verify the identity of the peaks, fractions were collected and soluble starch and beta-glucan assays were performed additional to gas chromatography analysis. We found that all the fractions contain only glucose and soluble starch assay is correlated to the HPSEC fractionation.

This success is related to the advances in biotechnology and also to the possibility of working with techniques such as the ""OSMAC"" (one strain-many compounds) to achieve different fungal secondary metabolites profiles upon modifying the culturing conditions. Using this approach, the fungal species Paecilomyces lilacinus was cultivated in potato dextrose broth under 14 different fermentative conditions by adding the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium to the growing medium in order to provide biotic stress. S. typhimurium was added alive or after inactivation by autoclave or microwave irradiation in different stages of fungal growth. Extracts were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate, a medium polarity solvent in order to avoid extracting culturing media components. Production of fatty acids of relevance for the pharmaceutical and food industries was enhanced by the modified fermentative conditions and they were identified and quantified. The extracts were evaluated for acetylcholinesterase inhibition and the more active extract (91±2.91% inhibition) was prepared in large scale.

23039105,"Potatoes can be stored for up to 1 year before being processed and consumed. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which fresh and stored color-fleshed potatoes retain their anticancer properties after baking and chipping compared with unprocessed potatoes. We utilized white-, yellow-, and purple-fleshed potato clones and tested their phenolic and anthocyanin content, antioxidant activity, metabolite profile, and antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic properties. When compared with unprocessed samples, baking or chipping led to significant losses in the phenolic and anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity of the potatoes. However, with storage, total phenolic and anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity increased in baked samples while in the chipped samples they remained constant. Ethanolic extracts of baked and chipped samples suppressed proliferation and elevated apoptosis (p < 0.05) in HCT-116 (p53 wild-type; ras mutated) and HT-29 (p53 mutated; ras wild-type) human colon cancer cell lines. Antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic properties of baked potatoes were similar to that of fresh potatoes, while chipping caused a significant suppression. Phenolic content and antioxidant activity of purple-fleshed potatoes, after baking, were comparable with those of anthocyanin-rich berries. Hence, purple-fleshed potatoes can be a healthier choice for consumers as they possess greater levels of bioactive compounds and anticancer properties even after processing as compared with their white- and yellow-fleshed counterparts.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000872', 'D000975', 'D017209', 'D045744', 'D049109', 'D002853', 'D003110', 'D005511', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D010636', 'D011198']","['Anthocyanins', 'Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Food Handling', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Phenols', 'Solanum tuberosum']",Combined effects of storage and processing on the bioactive compounds and pro-apoptotic properties of color-fleshed potatoes in human colon cancer cells.,"['Q000008', 'Q000008', None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['administration & dosage', 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23039105,2013

Mixtures of the sludge, SD and OW were composted for 57 days in insulated containers at two C:N ratios (approximately 30 : 1 and approximately 20 : 1) and SD textures (coarse- and fine-textured SD). The parameters monitored over this period were pH, electrical conductivity (EC), C:N ratio, CO2 evolution and two spectrophotometric ratios (Q2/6 and Q2/4). All the studied parameters were in general similarly influenced by initial C:N ratio and texture of SD except for EC, Q2/6 and Q2/4. At high C:N ratio of both textures, the EC of the final products increased but were less than those of low C:N ratio of both textures. Thus, final product can be used alone as growth medium without the need for grinding or blending with other materials. The spectrophotometric ratios (Q2/6 and Q2/4) dramatically decreased two weeks after composting and then slightly increased at the end of composting process. However, coarse-textured SD at the low C:N ratio and fine-textured SD at both C:N ratios resulted in lower Q2/6 and Q2/4 ratios, reflecting a better degree of aromatic condensation and organic matter humification.

In the present study, general adult population in Daegu, Korea (n=140, >20 years of old) was recruited, collected for serum, and analyzed for 13 major PFAAs. The influence of dietary and water consumption on serum PFAA levels was also evaluated. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) were frequently detected with relatively higher concentrations in blood serum. Most PFAA concentrations except for PFOA were detected in higher concentrations among males, and were positively correlated with age and body mass index (BMI). PFOA concentrations were relatively higher among the female of childbearing age, e.g., 20-49years old, raising concerns on potential impacts on fetus through transplacental transfer or lactation. In addition, the concentrations of PFOA in Daegu population were higher than other areas of Korea, suggesting a presence of distinctive sources in the area. Among food items, potato consumption was identified to be significant contributor to serum PFOA. For PFUnDA and PFTrDA levels, intake of fish/shellfish was positively associated.

A commercially available baby food (carrot/potato-based mash) was spiked with 11 pesticides at the respective EU maximum residue limits (MRLs), and further processed by either freezing or freeze-drying. Batches of some 150 units were produced per material type. First, the materials were assessed for the relative amount of pesticide recovered after processing (ratio of pesticide concentration in the processed material to the initially spiked pesticide concentration). In addition, the materials' homogeneity (bottle-to-bottle variation), and the short-term (1 month) and mid-term (5 months) stability at different temperatures were assessed. For this, an in-house validated GC-EI-MS method operated in the SIM mode with a sample preparation procedure based on the QuEChERS (""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe"") principle was applied. Measurements on the frozen material provided the most promising results (smallest analyte losses during production), and also freeze-drying proved to be a suitable alternative processing technique for most of the investigated pesticides.

Highest values of seedling length and vigour were recorded with Methylobacterium sp. (NC28). HPLC analysis of production by bacterial strains ranged from 1.09 to 9.89 μg ml(-1) of cytokinins in the culture filtrate.

To facilitate its analysis, a highly selective and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for determination of 5-HMF in food has been developed. A specific polyclonal antibody was produced against a conjugate of 5-HMF coupled to bovine serum albumin. The IC(50) and limit of method detection were 0.15 ± 0.012 mg L(-1) and 0.02 ± 0.002 mg L(-1), respectively. The proposed method was applied to detect 5-HMF in French mini bread, potato chips, French soft bread, and wheat chicken nuggets with recoveries ranging from 84.07 to 97.09% and relative standard deviation (n = 3) below 8.65% in all samples.

Vacuole sap proteins fractionated by gel filtration were studied by mass spectrometric analyses of trypsin and chymotrypsin digestions. The tuber vacuole appears to be a typical protein storage vacuole absent of proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes. The major soluble storage proteins included 28 Kunitz protease inhibitors, nine protease inhibitors 1, eight protease inhibitors 2, two carboxypeptidase inhibitors, eight patatins and five lipoxygenases (lox), which all showed cultivar-specific sequence variations. These proteins, except for lox, have typical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptides and putative vacuolar sorting determinants of either the sequence or structure specific type or the C-terminal type, or both. Unexpectedly, sap protein variants imported via the ER showed multiple molecular forms because of extensive and unspecific proteolytic cleavage of exposed N- and C-terminal propeptides and surface loops, in spite of the abundance of protease inhibitors. Some propeptides are potential novel vacuolar targeting peptides. In the insoluble vacuole fraction two variants of phytepsin (aspartate protease) were identified.

To systematically identify the proteins associated with this process, we employed a comparative proteomics approach using isobaric, stable isotope coded labels to compare the proteomes of potato tubers after 0 and 5 months of storage at 5 °C. We evaluated both high pH reverse phase (hpRP) liquid chromatography (LC) and off-gel electrophoresis (OGE) as first dimension fractionation methods followed by nanoLC-MS/MS, using two high performance mass spectrometry platforms (Q-TOF and Orbitrap). We found that hpRP-LC consistently offered better resolution, reduced expression ratio compression, and a more MS-compatible workflow than OGE and consistently yielded more unique peptide/protein identifications and higher sequence coverage with better quantification. In this study, a total of 4463 potato proteins were identified, of which 46 showed differential expressions during potato tuber cold storage. Several key proteins important in controlling starch-sugar conversion, which leads to cold-induced sweetening, as well as other proteins that are potentially involved in this process, were identified.

A pyrolysis temperature of 900 degrees C and atomization temperature of 2000 degrees C were used. This method allowed the determination of lead with a characteristic mass of 35 pg; LOD and LOQ of 0.6 and 2 nglg, respectively, were found. The precision was investigated in terms of reproducibility and repeatability. Reproducibility was estimated by analysis of nine different portions of a certified reference material (CRM) of spinach leaves, and the repeatability was determined through the analysis of nine aliquots of the same solution. The reproducibility and repeatability were found to be 4.27 and 2.94% RSD, respectively. The accuracy was confirmed by analysis of whole meal flour, spinach leaves, and orchard leaves CRMs, all furnished by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified rAp-S (3085.80Da) showed the addition of a glycine residue on its N-terminal end derived from vector design and peptide purification. The purified rApS fraction was assayed for antifungal activity by direct addition of purified rApS elution to potato dextrose agar media at a final concentration of 81nM. These assays showed important growth inhibitions of both biotrophic (Fusarium oxysporum, Trichoderma harzianum) and necrotrophic (Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria spp.) fungi in that the hyphae structures and spore count were affected in all cases.

A LIF detection method mediated by water-soluble CdTe quantum dots capped with mercaptopropyl acid (MPA) is thus developed for AAM quantitation. The optimized conditions are as follows: 30 mmol/L SDS, 0.1 mmol/L quantum dot, and 40 mmol/L phosphate buffer solution at pH 8.0 under 18 kV run voltage with LIF detection at 473 nm excitation and 568 nm fluorescence.

21452898,"Quantitative method validation is a well-established process to demonstrate trueness and precision of the results with a given method. However, an assessment of qualitative results is also an important need to estimate selectivity and devise criteria for chemical identification when using the method, particularly for mass spectrometric analysis. For multianalyte analysis, automatic instrument software is commonly used to make initial qualitative identifications of the target analytes by comparison of their mass spectra against a database library. Especially at low residue levels in complex matrices, manual checking of results is typically needed to correct the peak assignments and integration errors, which is very time-consuming. Low-pressure gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (LP-GC-MS) has been demonstrated to increase the speed of analysis for GC-amenable residues in various foods and provide more advantages over the traditional GC-MS approach. LP-GC-MS on a time-of-flight (ToF) instrument was used, which provided high sample throughput with <10 min analysis time. The method had already been validated to be acceptable quantitatively for nearly 150 pesticides, and in this study of qualitative performance, 90 samples in total of strawberry, tomato, potato, orange, and lettuce extracts from the QuEChERS sample preparation approach were analyzed. The extracts were randomly spiked with different pesticides at different levels, both unknown to the analyst, in the different matrices. Automated software evaluation was compared with human assessments in terms of false-positive and -negative results. Among the 13590 possible permutations with 696 blind additions made, the automated software approach yielded 1.2% false presumptive positives with 23% false negatives, whereas the analyst achieved 0.8% false presumptive positives and 17% false negatives for the same analytical data files. False negatives frequently occurred due to challenges at the lowest concentrations, but 70% of them involved certain pesticides that degraded (e.g., captafol, folpet) or otherwise could not be detected. The false-negative rate was reduced to 5-10% if the problematic analytes were excluded. Despite its somewhat better performance in this study, the analyst approach was extremely time-consuming and would not be practical in high sample throughput applications for so many analytes in complicated matrices.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D005506', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D010573', 'D014675']","['Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Vegetables']","Qualitative aspects in the analysis of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables using fast, low-pressure gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.","['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21452898,2011

30743679,"In northern Italy, blue mold can occur generally on apples after 3 months of storage under controlled atmospheres. The mold can be caused by Penicillium griseofulvum Dierckx (synonym P. urticae Bainier). During 2008, several postharvest fruit rots were observed on apples (cv. Golden Delicious) after 180 to 240 days of storage at 1°C. Approximately 8% of the fruits showed blue mold. Apples had been cultivated in Aosta (Aosta Valley Region) and Lagnasco (Piedmont Region). Infected fruits showed soft, watery, brown spots enlarging rapidly at 20°C. There was a distinct margin between soft rotted flesh and firm healthy tissues. Under high humidity, masses of blue-green spores formed on the surface of the lesion. Apple fruit excisions from the margin between the healthy and diseased tissues were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), pH 5.6. The recovered fungus produced abundant mycelium and conidia, with the colonies attaining a diameter of 2.0 to 2.4 cm after 7 days at 20 ± 2°C on PDA. Colonies were mostly yellow-green, with a yellowish-to-orange brown underside. Conidiophores were mononematous or loosely synnematous, hyaline, with branches strongly divergent. Phialides were cylindrical with a very short neck. Conidia were ellipsoidal, sometimes subglobose, 2.5 to 3.5 × 2.2 to 2.5 μm, hyaline to greenish. Preliminary morphological identification of the fungus (2) was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from mycelia of pure cultures. Two sequences, obtained through the amplification of ribosomal region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (1), were blast searched in GenBank and showed 99% sequence coverage and 99% similarity to ribosomal sequences of P. griseofulvum. Two sequences were deposited in GenBank with Accession Nos. HQ012498 (a strain from Aosta Valley) and HQ012499 (a strain from the Piedmont Region).

Conidial suspensions (30 μl of 105 conidia/ml) of the fungus were placed on artificial wounds generated on the apple surface. Control fruits were treated with sterile water. Seven days after inoculation, the symptoms were reproduced on the four cultivars and P. griseofulvum was reisolated on PDA from the inoculated fruits of all four cultivars. Control fruits were symptomless. An analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array of the rotting tissues associated with inoculated fruits of all four cultivars (4) confirmed, as in the case of other strains of P. griseofulvum, the production of the mycotoxin patulin (12.1 to 44.4 mg kg",Plant disease,[],[],First Report of Penicillium griseofulvum Causing Blue Mold on Stored Apples in Italy (Piedmont).,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30743679,2019

Granules were large, triangular, or shell-shaped with monomodal particle size distribution between 24.5 and 35.5 μm. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses revealed onset gelatinization temperatures from 69.1 to 73.4 °C with high gelatinization enthalpy changes from 22.4 to 25.3 J g(-1). All X-ray diffractograms of starches exhibit B-type crystallinity. Crystallinity degrees varied from 24% to 40%. The highest crystallinity was found for the genotype having the highest amylose content. Iodo-colorimetric, amperometric, and DSC amylose determinations varied from 1.4 to 8.7%, 2.2 to 5.9%, and 1.4 to 3.5% for Amazonian genotypes, in comparison with commercial Mapuey starches: 12.0, 9.5, and 8.7%, respectively. Solubility and swelling power at 90 °C varied from 2.1 to 4.4% and 20.5 to 37.0%, respectively. Gel clarity fluctuated from 22.4 to 79.2%, and high rapid visco analyzer (RVA) viscosity was developed at 5% starch suspension (between 1430 and 2250 cP). Amylopectin weight average molar mass M(w), radius of gyration R(G), hydrodynamic coefficient ν(G), and apparent molecular density d(Gapp) were determined using high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation (A4F) techniques coupled with multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) on the Dioscorea trifida genotypes exhibiting the lowest and highest amylose contents.

20962911,"The fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis can infect wheat kernels, causing red smudge, and has been shown to produce the anthraquinone mycotoxins emodin, catenarin, and islandicin. The growth of 8 fungal isolates from diverse regions was evaluated on various culture media and was found to be generally slowest on the semisynthetic Fries medium. The choice of carbon source had a significant effect on mycotoxin production, as assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The highest emodin concentration (194.18 ± 16.26 µg/g medium) was observed for isolate Alg 3-24 on Fries medium supplemented with fructose, while the highest catenarin concentration (302.54 ±13.92 µg/g medium) was observed for TS93-71B on Fries medium supplemented with starch. Islandicin was not produced by any isolate under the conditions tested. Evaluation of the dynamics of mycotoxin production by isolate 331-2 on V8-potato dextrose agar medium revealed a rapid accumulation of emodin and catenarin during the first week of incubation, followed by a large decline by 14 days. Differences in the growth of and mycotoxin production by isolates of P. tritici-repentis likely resulted from the differential composition of the media and (or) intraspecies variability.

In this study, we used immunoproteomic and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) methods to investigate the allergenicity of transgenic potatoes expressing Arabidopsis DREB1A (dehydration responsive element-binding protein 1A), driven by the rd29A promoter or the 35S promoter. Immunoproteomic analysis using sera from potato-allergic patients revealed several immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding protein spots. The patterns of protein binding were almost the same between transgenic and non-transgenic potatoes. The IgE-binding proteins in potato were identified as patatin precursors, a segment of serine protease inhibitor 2, and proteinase inhibitor II by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS/MS. 2D-DIGE analysis revealed several differences in protein expression between non-transgenic potato and transgenic potato; those showing increased expression in transgenic potatoes were identified as precursors of patatin, a major potato allergen, and those showing decreased expression in transgenic potatoes were identified as lipoxygenase and glycogen (starch) synthase. These results suggested that transgenic potatoes may express slightly higher levels of allergens, but their IgE-binding patterns were almost the same as those of control potatoes.

Biofortification of major staple crops (wheat [Triticum aestivum], rice [Oryza sativa], maize [Zea mays], and potato [Solanum tuberosum]) with β-carotene has the potential to alleviate this nutritional problem. Previously, we engineered transgenic ""Golden"" potato tubers overexpressing three bacterial genes for β-carotene synthesis (CrtB, CrtI, and CrtY, encoding phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, and lycopene β-cyclase, respectively) and accumulating the highest amount of β-carotene in the four aforementioned crops. Here, we report the systematic quantitation of carotenoid metabolites and transcripts in 24 lines carrying six different transgene combinations under the control of the 35S and Patatin (Pat) promoters. Low levels of B-I expression are sufficient for interfering with leaf carotenogenesis, but not for β-carotene accumulation in tubers and calli, which requires high expression levels of all three genes under the control of the Pat promoter. Tubers expressing the B-I transgenes show large perturbations in the transcription of endogenous carotenoid genes, with only minor changes in carotenoid content, while the opposite phenotype (low levels of transcriptional perturbation and high carotenoid levels) is observed in Golden (Y-B-I) tubers. We used hierarchical clustering and pairwise correlation analysis, together with a new method for network correlation analysis, developed for this purpose, to assess the perturbations in transcript and metabolite levels in transgenic leaves and tubers.

However, no methods for the specific detection of celery protein in foods have been published. In the present study, a sandwich celery ELISA using polyclonal anticelery antibodies for capture and detection was developed and validated. The method has an LOD of 0.5 mg/kg in buffer; however, it is applicable only for the screening of food products because of extensive cross-reactivity with potato and carrot proteins. Using nanoLC-ion-trap MS/MS, a number of proteins in the three vegetable species were identified as candidates for causing cross-reactions due to amino acid sequence homologies. Among others, a novel patatin (Sola t 1)-like protein was detected in celery and a flavin adenine dinucleotide binding domain-containing protein (Api g 5)-like protein was identified in carrot. The utility of triple-quadrupole MS/MS for specific and quantitative analysis of celery, potato, and carrot allergens was evaluated using whole protein extracts.

Proximate analysis, size exclusion chromatography, and two different degrees of hydrolysis (DH) analytical methods were also conducted. WPH were evaluated by a trained descriptive sensory panel, and volatile compounds were extracted by solid phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O). Eleven representative WPH were selected, and 15 aroma active compounds were quantified by GC-MS via the generation of external standard curves. Potato/brothy, malty, and animal flavors and bitter taste were key distinguishing sensory attributes of WPH. Correlations between bitter taste intensity, degree of hydrolysis (using both methods), and concentration of different molecular weight peptides were documented, with high DH samples having high bitter taste intensity and a high concentration of low molecular weight peptides and vice versa. The four aroma-active compounds out of 40 detected by GC-O present at the highest concentration and with consistently high odor activity values in WPH were Strecker derived products, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), 3-methyl butanal, 2-methyl butanal, and methional.

Maillard chemical models containing the amino acid asparagine and glucose with or without niacin were closely examined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Comparison of the chemical profiles revealed two additional peaks in models where niacin was present together with the AA precursors, which thus suggests the formation of compounds from reactions between niacin and other chemical species in the model systems. The predicted molecular weights of these two analytes were consistent with adducts formed between niacin and asparagine or AA, respectively. The niacin-acrylamide adduct was also detected in fried potato strips pretreated with niacin. In addition, the niacin-acrylamide adduct was subsequently purified and characterized by NMR spectroscopy as 1-propanamide-3-carboxy pyridinium, a novel compound that has never been reported previously. Furthermore, incubation of niacin with AA in simulated physiological conditions showed that niacin was capable of significantly reducing the level of AA.

In this study, six fruit extracts (apple, blueberry, mangosteen, longan, dragon fruit with white flesh, and dragon fruit with red flesh) were compared for their activities against acrylamide formation in chemical models containing equal molar quantities of glucose and asparagine in distilled water (160 degrees C for 30 min). Apple extract demonstrated potent inhibition on acrylamide formation. Blueberry, mangosteen, and longan extracts did not have significant impact, whereas dragon fruit extracts enhanced acrylamide formation. Column chromatography guided by chemical model analysis showed that the proanthocyanidin-rich subfraction played a key role in mediating the inhibitory activity.

The influence of different domestic cooking conditions, boiling, microwaving, and baking, on total phenolics (TP), antioxidant capacity, phenolic composition, and tryptophan content was studied using eight commercial potato varieties. The antioxidant capacity was detected by the methods of oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH(*)) assay. The phenolic composition and tryptophan content were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), whereas phenolics and tryptophan were identified by means of HPLC-mass spectrometry, HPLC-DAD, and authentic standards. Antioxidant capacity was influenced by potato variety and cooking conditions; however, cooked potatoes retained 68-97% ORAC value depending on cooking procedure and variety. Chlorogenic acid and its isomers dominated the phenolic composition of each variety involved in this study. ORAC and TP were highly and positively correlated (r = 0.9119). Norkotah ranked highest in chlorogenic acid content and antioxidant value. Principal component analysis showed different cooking processes did not influence the trend of the antioxidant profile of the eight potato varieties, but specific compounds exert influence on the antioxidant capacity.

An attempt was made to partially purify and characterize the diffusible antifungal metabolite/s produced by the strain RP24 and its negative mutant (NM) in potato dextrose medium. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of partially purified extract of RP24 showed the presence of lipopeptide antibiotic iturin as a major peak that was comparable to that of standard iturin A (5.230 min) from Sigma-Aldrich whereas the corresponding peak was absent in extract of NM. The structure was further confirmed by liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric (LCMS) analysis as iturin A. LCMS analysis also showed the presence of surfactin and fengycin besides iturin A. Amplification of the lpa-14 (encodes the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase required for the maturation of template enzyme of iturin A) and ituD (encodes a putative malonyl coenzyme A transacylase, whose disruption results in a specific deficiency in iturin A production) genes of iturin operon of strain RP24 was carried out and the sequences obtained were compared with the existing database of NCBI. The sequences of lpa-14 and ituD gene of RP24 showed 98% and 97% homology with lpa-14 and ituD genes of B. subtilis in the existing database.

Slicing triggered differentiation processes that lead to changes in metabolism, activation of defence and cell-wall reinforcement. Proteins related to storage, cell growth and division, cell structure, signal transduction, energy production, disease/defence mechanisms and secondary metabolism were detected. Image analysis of the 2-DE gels revealed a time-dependent change in the complexity of the polypeptide patterns. By microscopic observation the polyalyphatic domain of suberin was clearly visible by D4, indicating that a closing layer (primary suberisation) was formed by then. A PCA of the six sampling dates revealed two time phases, D0-D2 and D4-D8, with a border position between D2 and D4. Moreover, a PCA of differentially expressed proteins indicated the existence of a succession of proteomic events leading to wound-periderm reconstruction. Some late-expressed proteins (D6-D8), including a suberisation-associated anionic peroxidase, have also been identified in the native periderm.

19680950,"Furan is a possible human carcinogen (IARC group 2B) with widespread occurrence in many types of foods. In this study, a survey of furan contamination in 230 commercially jarred ready-to-eat infant food products was conducted using headspace sampling in combination with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) with a detection limit of 0.2 microg kg(-1). The incidence of furan contamination in jarred infant beverages, cereals and fruits was relatively low, with average concentrations below 10 microg kg(-1). Significantly higher concentrations were found in pasta (34.8 +/- 14.5 microg kg(-1)), meals containing meat (28.2 +/- 15.0 microg kg(-1)), and meals containing vegetables (31.2 +/- 17.3 microg kg(-1)). The average exposure of 6-month-old infants to furan was estimated to be 0.2 microg per kg bodyweight per day. The margin of exposure calculated using the T25 dose descriptor would be 2692, which points to a possible public health risk. In contrast to commercially jarred food products, none of 20 freshly home-prepared baby foods contained furan above the limit of detection. Only after re-heating in closed vessels was furan found to have formed. Furan was especially prevalent in reheated foods containing potatoes, with values ranging between 2.3 and 29.2 microg kg(-1). The formation of furan in potato-containing baby foods was increased by addition of ascorbic acid, by longer heating times above 1 h and by temperatures above 50 degrees C. Research regarding reduction of furan in commercial baby foods should be conducted, with a priority aimed at reducing this heat-induced contaminant without concomitantly increasing the microbiological risk.","Food additives & contaminants.

The work was based on the square wave voltammetry responses of diquat, which presented two well-defined and reversible reduction peaks, at -0.56 V (peak 1) and -1.00 V (peak 2). The experimental and voltammetric parameters were optimised, and the analytical curves were constructed and compared to similar curves performed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometric detector (HPLC/UV-vis). The responses were directly proportional to diquat concentration in a large interval of concentration, and the calculated detection limits were very similar, around 10 microg L(-1) (10 ppb) for voltammetric and chromatographic experiments. These values were lower than the maximum residue limit established for natural water by the Brazilian Environmental Agency. The recovery percentages in pure electrolyte, natural water and potato samples showed values from 70% to 130%, demonstrating that the voltammetric methodology proposed is suitable for determining any contamination by diquat in different samples, minimising the toxic residues due to the use of liquid mercury or the adsorptive process relative to use of other solid surfaces.",Talanta,"['D002845', 'D004563', 'D004566']","['Chromatography', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes']",A simple and sensitive detection of diquat herbicide using a dental amalgam electrode: a comparison using the chromatographic technique.,"[None, None, None]","[None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19635349,2009

One alpha-amylase was isolated from whole larval midguts of T. molitor using non-denaturing SDS-PAGE, while two other alpha-amylase fractions were isolated from whole larval midguts of Z. subfasciatus using hydrophobic interaction chromatography., Digested starch granules from larvae fed on maize, potato or wheat were isolated from midgut contents. Combinations of starch granules with isolated alpha-amylases from both species showed similar patterns of granule degradation. In vitro enzymatic degradation of maize starch granules by the three different alpha-amylase fractions began by creating small holes and crater-like areas on the surface of the granules. Over time, these holes increased in number and area resulting in extensive degradation of the granule structure. Granules from potato did not show formation of pits and craters on their surface, but presented extensive erosion in their interior. For all types of starch, as soon as the interior of the starch granule was reached, the inner layers of amylose and amylopectin were differentially hydrolyzed, resulting in a striated pattern.

Soil, vegetable, and fruit samples from the most important agricultural city areas were collected from July to November of 2006. Metal contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, whereas pesticide residues were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after extraction performed using solid-phase microextraction technique. Soil characterization based on the determination of selected physical and chemical properties revealed heterogeneous soils belonging to different soil groups. The concentrations of lead, cadmium, copper, and zinc in soil samples do not exceed the limits established by national and international regulations. Residues of the herbicide atrazine were detected in three soil samples, with levels lower than the relevant limit. The presence of other herbicides, namely prometryn, chloridazon, acetochlor, flurochloridone, and napropamide, was registered in some soil samples as well. Among the insecticides investigated in the soil, fenitrothion and chlorpyrifos were the only ones detected. In most of the investigated vegetable samples from the Obrenovac area, Pb and Cd contents are higher in comparison with the maximum levels, indicating the emission of coal combustion products from local thermal power plants as a possible source of contamination. Residue levels of some herbicides and insecticides (metribuzin, trifluralin, pendimethalin, bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos, and cypermethrin) determined in tomato, pepper, potato, and onion samples from Slanci, Ovca, and Obrenovac areas are even several times higher than the maximum residue levels.

19534529,"The influence of a commercial production process for dehydrated potato flakes on the content of free phenolic compounds, total phenolics, and glycoalkaloids in potatoes during the subsequent processing steps was determined. Processing byproducts, such as potato peel (steam peeling), mashed potato residues, and side streams (blanching and cooking waters), have also been investigated. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to separate and quantify caffeic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, p-hydoxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, catechin, and three isomers of caffeoylquinic acid: chlorogenic, neochlorogenic and cryptochlorogenic acid. Determination of the glycoalkaloids alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine was performed by using a high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method. The deliverables reveal that processing potatoes to potato flakes remarkably diminishes the content of the analyzed compounds, mainly due to peeling and leaching. The influence of thermal exposure is less significant. About 43% of the initial phenolic acids and 10% of the glycoalkaloids remain after processing. The results of the total phenolic content assay by Folin-Ciocalteu reagent are proportional to the content of phenolic compounds determined by HPLC. Steam peeling has a higher influence on glycoalkaloid losses compared to that on phenolics. The highest amounts of phenolic compounds and glycoalkaloids were found in peeling byproduct.

Foods included fish (sardine, hake, and tuna), meat (veal steak, loin of pork, breast and thigh of chicken, and steak and rib of lamb), string bean, potato, rice, and olive oil. For each food item, two composite samples were prepared for metal analyses, whose levels in raw and cooked (fried, grilled, roasted, and boiled) samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The highest concentrations of As, Hg, and Pb (raw and cooked samples) were mainly found in fish, with a clear tendency, in general, to increase metal concentrations after cooking. However, in these samples, Cd levels were very close to their detection limit. In turn, the concentrations of metals in raw and cooked meat samples were detected in all samples (As) or only in a very few samples (Cd, Hg, and Pb). A similar finding corresponded to string beans, rice, and olive oil, while in potatoes, Hg could not be detected and Pb only was detected in the raw samples.

Although primarily a pathogen of cereals, it also can infect noncereal crops such as potato and sugar beet in the United States. We used a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method based on intergenic sequences specific to the trichodiene synthase gene (Tri5) from F. graminearum. TaqMan probe and primers were designed and used to estimate DNA content of the pathogen (FgDNA) in the susceptible wheat cv. Grandin after inoculation with the 21 isolates of F. graminearum collected from potato, sugar beet, and wheat. The presence of nine mycotoxins was analyzed in the inoculated wheat heads by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. All isolates contained the Tri5 gene and were virulent to cv. Grandin. Isolates of F. graminearum differed significantly in virulence (expressed as disease severity), FgDNA content, and mycotoxin accumulation. Potato isolates showed greater variability in producing different mycotoxins than sugar beet and wheat isolates. Correlation analysis showed a significant (P < 0.001) positive relationship between FgDNA content and FHB severity or deoxynivalenol (DON) production. Moreover, a significant (P < 0.001) positive correlation between FHB severity and DON content was observed. Our findings revealed that F. graminearum causing potato dry rot and sugar beet decay could be potential sources of inoculum for FHB epidemics in wheat. Real-time PCR assay provides sensitive and accurate quantification of F. graminearum in wheat and can be useful for monitoring the colonization of wheat grains by F. graminearum in controlled environments, and evaluating wheat germplasms for resistance to FHB.",Phytopathology,[],[],"Real-time PCR Quantification and Mycotoxin Production of Fusarium graminearum in Wheat Inoculated with Isolates Collected from Potato, Sugar Beet, and Wheat.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18943932,2012

To cope with the inherent complexity, techniques based on targeted quantification using proteotypic peptides are arising. This is an essential systems biology approach; however, for the exploratory discovery of unexpected markers, nontargeted detection of proteins, and protein modifications is indispensable. We present a rapid label-free shotgun proteomics approach that extracts relevant phenotype-specific peptide product ion spectra in an automated workflow without prior identification. These product ion spectra are subsequently sequenced with database search and de novo prediction algorithms. We analyzed six potato tuber cultivars grown on three plots of two geographically separated fields in Germany. For data mining about 1.5 million spectra from 107 analyses were aligned and statistically examined in approximately 1 day. Several cultivar-specific protein markers were detected. Based on de novo-sequencing a dominant protein polymorphism not detectable in the available EST-databases was assigned exclusively to a specific potato cultivar. The approach is applicable to organisms with unsequenced or incomplete genomes and to the automated extraction of relevant mass spectra that potentially cannot be identified by genome/EST-based search algorithms.",Proteomics,"['D015415', 'D002853', 'D010641', 'D010940', 'D020641', 'D040901', 'D015203', 'D020539', 'D011198', 'D049490', 'D053719']","['Biomarkers', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Proteins', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Systems Biology', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",A rapid approach for phenotype-screening and database independent detection of cSNP/protein polymorphism using mass accuracy precursor alignment.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None]","['analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18924179,2009

18624452,"Potentially toxic acrylamide is largely derived from heat-induced reactions between the amino group of the free amino acid asparagine and carbonyl groups of glucose and fructose in cereals, potatoes, and other plant-derived foods. This overview surveys and consolidates the following dietary aspects of acrylamide: distribution in food originating from different sources; consumption by diverse populations; reduction of the acrylamide content in the diet; and suppression of adverse effects in vivo. Methods to reduce adverse effects of dietary acrylamide include (a) selecting potato, cereal, and other plant varieties for dietary use that contain low levels of the acrylamide precursors, namely, asparagine and glucose; (b) removing precursors before processing; (c) using the enzyme asparaginase to hydrolyze asparagine to aspartic acid; (d) selecting processing conditions (pH, temperature, time, processing and storage atmosphere) that minimize acrylamide formation; (e) adding food ingredients (acidulants, amino acids, antioxidants, nonreducing carbohydrates, chitosan, garlic compounds, protein hydrolysates, proteins, metal salts) that have been reported to prevent acrylamide formation; (f) removing/trapping acrylamide after it is formed with the aid of chromatography, evaporation, polymerization, or reaction with other food ingredients; and (g) reducing in vivo toxicity. Research needs are suggested that may further facilitate reducing the acrylamide burden of the diet. Researchers are challenged to (a) apply the available methods and to minimize the acrylamide content of the diet without adversely affecting the nutritional quality, safety, and sensory attributes, including color and flavor, while maintaining consumer acceptance; and (b) educate commercial and home food processors and the public about available approaches to mitigating undesirable effects of dietary acrylamide.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D020106', 'D000293', 'D000328', 'D000368', 'D000369', 'D001215', 'D001216', 'D002648', 'D002675', 'D004032', 'D002523', 'D005260', 'D005504', 'D005511', 'D005947', 'D006358', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D008297', 'D008875', 'D011198']","['Acrylamide', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asparaginase', 'Asparagine', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diet', 'Edible Grain', 'Female', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Glucose', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Solanum tuberosum']",Review of methods for the reduction of dietary content and toxicity of acrylamide.,"['Q000008', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['administration & dosage', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18624452,2008

Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets. Population consumption patterns of carotenoid isomers using a comprehensive database are used to improve our understanding in disease prevention. Consumption in Israel seems to be generally higher than that reported in studies conducted elsewhere, and varies by ethnic group.",International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

Christmas sweets, olives, traditionally made potato crisps, pastry products, sweet fritters (""churros"") and one of Spain's most famous dishes, Spanish omelette, were selected. Using the mass spectra information provided by an ion trap analyzer in combination with the accurate mass measurements from time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometry a co-extractive interference present in some potato products was identified as valine. A porous graphitic carbon column, which enabled the co-extractive and acrylamide to be separated, and ion trap or triple quadrupole analyzers, depending on the acrylamide concentration, were used to determine this genotoxic compound in foodstuffs. The highest values were found in potato products, sweet fritters, Christmas sweets and pastry products, with values ranging between 70 and 2000 microg/g.

To prepare an effective immunogen compound for acrylamide, N-acryloxysuccinimide (NAS) was conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) at a high molar ratio of 21.2:1. Antisera were obtained by immunization of rabbits with additional booster injections of the NAS-BSA conjugate after the regular process. The IgGs purified by an ammonium sulfate precipitation method were further fractionated with a BSA-immobilized immunoaffinity column. The affinity constant between the collected antibody and coated antigen (NAS-ovalbumin) is found to be 6.7 x 10(7) L mol(-1). Asparagine, the key precursor of acrylamide formation in foods, showed negligible cross-reactivity to the antibody.

18473469,"Potato and wheat starch granules were soaked in 1% aqueous solutions of copper(II) salts: acetate, chloride, and sulfate. Such treatment caused sorption of Cu(2+) ions at the granule surface and their penetration into the granule interior as was proven, for sectioned granules of investigated starch, by scanning electron microscopy combined with an X-ray microanalysis system (energy dispersive spectroscopy). Copper ions incorporated into the granules influenced the starch thermal stability. Uptake of Cu(2+) by potato, determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry, was much higher than obtained for the wheat starch. Moreover, it was dependent on copper counteranions present in the solution. In all investigated granules, the most effective sorption occurred in the acetate solution. Starch dehydration or/and freezing and thawing, affecting the water-dependent inner structure of the granules, also influenced the amount of Cu(2+) taken from the solutions. Thus, compared to that in native starch, this value was considerably higher in Cu(CH 3COO)2, almost unchanged in CuSO4, and significantly lower in the case of CuCl2 solution. The influence of chloride and sulfate anions seemed to correlate with their water structure-making and structure-breaking ability, affecting the migration of Cu(2+) in the amorphous parts of the granules. However, high Cu uptake observed for acetate solution could be explained on the basis of acetate anion hydrolysis activating the polysaccharide matrix for cation binding.

Because antioxidative phenolic compounds are also reported to participate in enzymatic browning reactions and to exhibit health-promoting effects in humans, a need exists for accurate methods to measure their content in fresh and processed potatoes. To contribute to our knowledge about the levels of phenolic compounds in potatoes, we validated and used high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to measure levels of chlorogenic acid, a chlorogenic isomer, and caffeic acid in flowers, leaves, stems, and tubers of the potato plant and in home-processed potatoes. The total phenolic acid content of flowers (626 mg/100 g fresh wt) was 21 and 59 times greater than that of leaves and stems, respectively. For all samples, chlorogenic acid and its isomer contributed 96-98% to the total.

Storage starch is packed densely in tuber amyloplasts, which become starch granules. Amyloplasts of soil-grown mini-tubers and agar-grown micro-tubers of cv. Kuras were purified. The mini-tuber amyloplast preparation was enriched 10-20-fold and the micro-tuber amyloplast approximately fivefold over comparative total protein extracts. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were digested with trypsin, analysed by mass spectrometry and identified by mascot software searches against an in-house potato protein database and the NCBI non-redundant plant database. The differential growth conditions for mini- and micro-tubers gave rise to rather different protein profiles, but the major starch granule-bound proteins were identical for both and dominated by granule-bound starch synthase I, starch synthase II and alpha-glucan water dikinase. Soluble proteins were dominated by starch phosphorylase L-1, other large proteins of the classes 'starch and sucrose metabolism', 'pentose phosphate pathway', 'glycolysis', 'amino acid metabolism', and other proteins such as plastid chaperonins. The majority of the identified proteins had a predicted plastid transit peptide, supporting their presence in the amyloplast.

18215649,"The spontaneous formation of the neurotoxic carcinogen acrylamide in a wide range of cooked foods has recently been discovered. These foods include bread and other bakery products, crisps, chips, breakfast cereals, and coffee. To date, the diminutive size of acrylamide (71.08 Da) has prevented the development of screening immunoassays for this chemical. In this study, a polyclonal antibody capable of binding the carcinogen was produced by the synthesis of an immunogen comprising acrylamide derivatised with 3-mercaptobenzoic acid (3-MBA), and its conjugation to the carrier protein bovine thyroglobulin. Antiserum from the immunised rabbit was harvested and fully characterised. It displayed no binding affinity for acrylamide or 3-MBA but had a high affinity for 3-MBA-derivitised acrylamide. The antisera produced was utilised in the development of an ELISA based detection system for acrylamide. Spiked water samples were assayed for acrylamide content using a previously published extraction method validated for coffee, crispbread, potato, milk chocolate and potato crisp matrices. Extracted acrylamide was then subjected to a rapid 1-h derivatisation with 3-MBA, pre-analysis. The ELISA was shown to have a high specificity for acrylamide, with a limit of detection in water samples of 65.7 microgkg(-1), i.e. potentially suitable for acrylamide detection in a wide range of food commodities. Future development of this assay will increase sensitivity further.

18211375,"Generally the main component of fishy flavor is considered to be trimethylamine. On the other hand, carbonyl compounds, produced from oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid by lipoxygenase or by autoxidation, might have some contribution to the fishy flavor. Since sardine skin contains high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and lipoxygenase, carbonyl compounds may be generated more easily than trimethylamine. In this study, volatile flavor compounds of sardine were analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry and gas chromatograph-olfactometry combined with solid phase microextraction. Then, the flavor components that contribute to fishy flavor were identified. At normal pH (6.2), trimethylamine was not detected or sensed from the fresh sardines. When the pH was raised, the amount of trimethylamine became higher. Trimethylamine flavor was weak at pH 9 and strongly sensed at pH 11 or higher. On the other hand, 33 other compounds were positively or tentatively identified, including 8 hydrocarbons, 5 ketones, 1 furan, 1 sulfur compound, 12 aldehydes, and 6 alcohols in fresh sardines. Among them, 2,3-pentanedione, hexanal, and 1-penten-3-ol were the main components. Forty-seven flavors were detected by gas chromatograph-olfactometry. Among them, paint-like (1-penten-3-one), caramel-like (2,3-pentanedione), green-like (hexanal), shore-like ((Z)-4-heptenal), citrus note (octanal), mushroom-like (1-octen-3-one), potato-like (methional), insect-like ((E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal), and bloody note (not identified) were strongly sensed.

We have recently shown that a CLA-rich soy oil can be produced by simple isomerization of linoleic acid in soy oil by photoirradiation. This oil may allow greatly increased dietary CLA without significantly elevating fat intake. The objective of this study was to prepare CLA-rich potato chips by frying in CLA-rich soy oil. Soy oil was photoisomerized in the presence of iodine catalyst with UV/visible light. The irradiated oil was clay processed to remove the residual iodine and this oil was then used to fry potato chips. Oil was extracted from fried chips and analyzed for its CLA content with gas chromatography. A 1-oz serving of CLA-rich potato chips contained approximately 2.4 g CLA as compared to 0.1 g CLA in 3-oz serving of steak fillet and 0.06 g CLA in 8-oz serving of whole milk.

17995763,"In this study, the formation of acrylamide upon treatment with microwave and conventional heating, boiling, or frying was investigated in both Asn/Fru and Asn/Glc model systems and in potato chips. Acrylamide levels were analyzed by HPLC method, which was confirmed by HPLC-MS/MS. Present results in model systems showed that pH value had a complex influence on the formation of acrylamide in the 2 systems during both microwaving (600 W) and boiling (120 +/- 1 degrees C). At pH < 8.0, acrylamide content increased with increasing the pH value, reaching the maximum at pH 8.0 whereas acrylamide content decreased with the increase of pH. Regardless of pH and heating methods, acrylamide content generally increased with increasing treatment time. Surprisingly, all present results showed that microwave heating not only induced acrylamide formation in the 2 model systems but also facilitated more acrylamide to be formed as compared to the boiling method at identical pH and treatment time. At pH 4.0, 8.0, and 10.0, the larger the microwave power, the more the acrylamide content. Consistent with the above observation, treatment of potato chips with microwave heating for 2.5 to 3.5 min in the range 550 to 750 W similarly resulted in acrylamide formation. The highest acrylamide content was formed by 750 W microwave treatment as 0.897 +/- 0.099 mg/kg, which was significantly higher than that produced by traditional frying (180 +/- 1 degrees C), 0.645 +/- 0.035 mg/kg (P < 0.05).",Journal of food science,"['D020106', 'D002851', 'D003296', 'D005504', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D006863', 'D008872', 'D008956', 'D011198', 'D013997']","['Acrylamide', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cooking', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Microwaves', 'Models, Chemical', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Time Factors']",A comparative study of acrylamide formation induced by microwave and conventional heating methods.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None]","['analysis', None, None, 'methods', 'methods', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17995763,2008

Higher levels of BaP were detected in fried chicken (5.25-5.55 BaP microg/kg) and smoked dried beef (5.47 microg/kg) compared to relatively lower levels measured in sesame oil (0.36 microg/kg) and peanut (0.44 microg/kg). The BaP levels in nonmeat items were generally low in detection, but certain potato chip products showed levels up to 4.06 BaP microg/kg. In terms of chronic daily intake of BaP, fried chicken was shown to be the highest (70.09 ng/person/d) and perilla oil was the lowest (0.05 ng/person/d). The total daily intake of BaP due to the consumption of various food items investigated was estimated to be 124.55 ng/person/d, based on daily food consumption and the contaminant level of BaP. The dietary BaP-related cancer risk using carcinogenic potency factor of BaP as 7.3E + 0 (mg/kg/d)(-1) was assessed to be 1.52 x 10(-5).

For all three species, the relationships were non-linear with an increasing slope with increasing SPAD. The relationships for birch and wheat were strong (r (2) approximately 0.9), while the potato relationship was comparatively weak (r (2) approximately 0.5). Birch and wheat had very similar relationships when the chlorophyll concentration was expressed per unit leaf area, but diverged when it was expressed per unit fresh weight. Furthermore, wheat showed similar SPAD-[chl] relationships for two different cultivars and during two different growing seasons. The curvilinear shape of the SPAD-[chl] relationships agreed well with the simulated effects of non-uniform chlorophyll distribution across the leaf surface and multiple scattering, causing deviations from linearity in the high and low SPAD range, respectively. The effect of non-uniformly distributed chlorophyll is likely to be more important in explaining the non-linearity in the empirical relationships, since the effect of scattering was predicted to be comparatively weak. The simulations were based on the algorithm for the calculation of SPAD-502 output values.

This study explored links between urinary cadmium levels and consumption frequency of these traditional foods and piloted a community-based methodology to identify potential determinants of cadmium exposure and accumulation. Consultations led to selection of one community for study from which 60 women aged 30 to 50 years participated in health and food frequency survey, urine collection and a routine health check. Urinary cadmium levels were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry; data were analysed using SPSS-14. The geometric mean cadmium level in this group of women was 1.17 (arithmetic mean 1.86) microg/g creatinine with one-third exceeding 2.0 microg/g creatinine. Heavy smoking (>or=300 pack years) was linked to higher cadmium in urine, as was increasing age and waist circumference. Analysis of age-adjusted residuals revealed significant associations (P<0.05) between cadmium level and higher consumption of turtle liver and kidney, locally gathered clams, peanuts, coconut, chocolate and potato chips. Dugong kidney consumption approached significance (P=0.06). Multiple regression revealed that 40% (adjusted r(2)) of variation in cadmium level was explained by the sum of these associated foods plus heavy smoking, age and waist circumference. No relationships between cadmium and pregnancy history were found.

Potato crisps and French fries were immersed into different contents of AOB solution, and the frying processing parameters were optimized. The acrylamide content was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The sensory evaluation was performed in double blind manner. Our results showed that nearly 74.1% and 76.1% of acrylamide in potato crisps and French fries was reduced when the AOB addition ratio was 0.1% and 0.01% (w/w), respectively.

17193744,"The main source of acrylamide in the diet are thermally processed carbohydrate-rich products, mainly those obtained from potatoes. Acrylamide is a substance with neurotoxic, genotoxic and carcinogenic properties. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified it as a potential human carcinogen in 1994. The purpose of this study was to assess acrylamide content in 24 samples of crisps randomly collected in Poland in 2004. Acrylamide was determined in the form of brominated derivatives by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The average acrylamide content in the crisp samples examined was 998 mg/kg of the product, ranging from 352 to 3647 microg/kg, depending on the type of the crisps. The factor determining the differences in acrylamide content in the product was also the manufacturer. The average content of acrylamide in the crisps produced by three different manufacturers (manufacturers 1-3) was ca. 600-900 microg/kg, and in the crisps produced by manufacturer 4 was ca. 3 times higher. Moreover, substantial differences were found between the same types of crisps produced by the same manufacturers but originating from different manufacturing batches.

Pesticides were extracted from homogenized food samples with acetonitrile and decontaminated via the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) technique, using a primary secondary amine as sorbent prior to GPC-GC/MS analysis. A slightly modified preparation method and automated GPC step proved useful in minimizing matrix interference. To evaluate the performance of the system, 97 target pesticides were spiked at a concentration of 0.1mg/kg into a range of food types, including potato, cabbage, carrot, apple, orange, cucumber, and rice. A low flow rate of 0.1 mL/min in GPC resulted in a 40-fold reduction in solvent consumption compared with conventional GPC column applications. The combination of MSPD technique and GPC-GC/MS for the analysis of the 97 pesticides can be accomplished within 90 min. Most pesticides were recovered in the range of 70-120%, with relative standard deviation generally less than 10%.

Controls included wildtype tubers, tubers produced from plants regenerated through tissue culture (including a callus phase) and tubers derived from transformation with the 'empty vector' i.e. no specific target gene included (with the exception of the kanamycin resistance gene as a selectable marker). Metabolite analysis included soluble carbohydrates, glycoalkaloids, vitamin C, total nitrogen and fatty acids. Trypsin inhibitor activity was also assayed. These cover the major compounds recommended by the OECD in their Consensus Document on Compositional Considerations for New Varieties of Potatoes: Key Food and Feed Nutrients, Anti-Nutrients and Toxicants (2002). Data was statistically analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for individual compounds and, where applicable, principal component analysis (PCA). In general, targeted compositional analysis revealed no consistent differences between GM lines and respective controls. No construct specifically induced unintended effects. Statistically significant differences between wildtype controls and specific GM lines did occur but appeared to be random and not associated with any specific construct. Indeed such significant differences were also found between wildtypes and both tissue culture derived tubers and tubers derived from transformation with the empty vector. This raises the possibility that somaclonal variation (known to occur significantly in potato, depending on genotype) may be responsible for an unknown proportion of any differences observed between specific GM lines and the wildtype.

16684499,"Soybeans are a rich source of protein and a key feed ingredient in livestock production, but lack sufficient levels of cysteine and methionine to meet the nutritional demands of swine or poultry as feed components. Although engineering the sulfur assimilatory pathway could lead to increased sulfur-containing amino acid content, little is known about this pathway in legumes. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of soybean ATP sulfurylase (ATPS), which acts as the metabolic entry point into the sulfur assimilation pathway. Analysis of the ATPS clone isolated from a soybean seedling cDNA library revealed an open-reading frame, encoding a 52 kDa polypeptide with an N-terminal chloroplast/plastid transit peptide, which was related to the enzymes from Arabidopsis, potato, human, and yeast. Soybean ATP sulfurylase was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. Based on gel-filtration chromatography, the enzyme functions as a 100 kDa homodimer. Analysis of genomic DNA by Southern blotting revealed that multiple genes encode ATP sulfurylase in soybean. Analysis of the transcript profiles retrieved from a soybean EST database indicated that ATP sulfurylase mRNA was most abundant in root tissue. Cold treatment induced mRNA accumulation and enhanced the specific activity of ATP sulfurylase in root tissue. Northern blot analysis indicated a decline in the ATP sulfurylase transcript levels during seed development. Likewise, ATP sulfurylase specific activity also declined in the later stages of seed development. Increasing the expression levels of this key enzyme during soybean seed development could lead to an increase in the availability of sulfur amino acids, thereby enhancing the nutritional value of the crop.",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,"['D002736', 'D003001', 'D003080', 'D018076', 'D019281', 'D004926', 'D018507', 'D015971', 'D018506', 'D005810', 'D010940', 'D018517', 'D020836', 'D012333', 'D036226', 'D012639', 'D013025', 'D013430', 'D013455', 'D014158']","['Chloroplasts', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cold Temperature', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dimerization', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Multigene Family', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Seedlings', 'Seeds', 'Soybeans', 'Sulfate Adenylyltransferase', 'Sulfur', 'Transcription, Genetic']","Soybean ATP sulfurylase, a homodimeric enzyme involved in sulfur assimilation, is abundantly expressed in roots and induced by cold treatment.","['Q000201', None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000196', None, 'Q000096', 'Q000201', 'Q000201', 'Q000196', 'Q000096', 'Q000378', 'Q000502']","['enzymology', None, None, 'genetics', None, 'genetics', 'physiology', 'physiology', 'physiology', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'embryology', None, 'biosynthesis', 'enzymology', 'enzymology', 'embryology', 'biosynthesis', 'metabolism', 'physiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16684499,2006

The method included defatting with n-hexane, extraction with aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl), derivatization with potassium bromate (KBrO3) and potassium bromide (KBr), and liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. The final acrylamide extract was analyzed by GC-ECD for quantification and by GC-MS for confirmation. The chromatographic analysis was performed on the HP-INNOWax capillary column, and good retention and peak response of acrylamide were achieved under the optimal conditions (numbers of theoretical plates N = 83,815). The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 0.1 microg kg(-1) on the basis of ECD technique. Recoveries of acrylamide from conventional samples spiked at levels of 150, 500 and 1000 microg kg(-1) (n = 4 for each level) ranged between 87 and 97% with relative standard deviations (RSD) of less than 4%. Furthermore, the GC-ECD method showed that no clean-up steps of acrylamide derivative would be performed prior to injection and was slightly more sensitive than the MS/MS-based methods.

16536568,"Immunoaffinity supports (IAS) were prepared using broad specific polyclonal anti-sulfonylurea (SU) antibodies immobilized in sol-gel glass. Two different kinds of supports were applied, crushed sol-gel monoliths and sol-gel-coated highly porous silica particles. Both were used for the quantitative enrichment of SUs in natural water and food samples followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet/diode array detection (HPLC-UV/DAD) and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), respectively. Loading, washing, and elution conditions of IAS were optimized. The capacity of supports was determined for 30 SUs and compared with the cross-reactivity pattern of the direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The capacities correlated well with the affinity to individual SU compounds. Even analytes to which the polyclonal antibodies showed only a lower cross-reactivity could be enriched to a certain degree, if a sufficient capacity of IAS was provided. The IAS could be reused at least 10 times without a loss of effectiveness. Recovery of 16 selected SUs extracted from spiked water and food samples was dependent on the affinity of both immobilized antibodies to single compounds and matrix interferences. In water, 13 SUs showed recoveries higher than 80% when immunoaffinity extraction was used in combination with LC-UV/DAD. On the basis of the enrichment of 200 mL of aqueous sample, corresponding limit of detection (LOD) values ranged between 20 and 100 ng/L.

16524605,"An anionic potato peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7, APP) thought to be involved in suberization after wounding was isolated from slices of Solanum tuberosum in order to elucidate the first steps of dehydrogenative polymerization between pairs of different hydroxycinnamic acids (FA, CafA, CA and SA) present in wound-healing plant tissues. Use of a commercial horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-H2O2 catalytic system gave the identical major products in these coupling reactions, providing sufficient quantities for purification and structural elucidation. Using an equimolar mixture of pairs of hydroxycinnamic acid suberin precursors, only caffeic acid is coupled to ferulic acid and sinapic acid in separate cross-coupling reactions. For the other systems, HRP and APP reacted as follows: (1) preferentially with ferulic acid in a reaction mixture that contained p-coumaric and ferulic acids; (2) with sinapic acid in a mixture of p-coumaric and sinapic acids; (3) with sinapic acid in a mixture of ferulic and sinapic acids; (4) with caffeic acid in a reaction mixture of p-coumaric and caffeic acids. The resulting products, isolated and identified by NMR and MS analysis, had predominantly beta-beta-gamma-lactone and beta-5 benzofuran molecular frameworks. Five cross-coupling products are described for the first time, whereas the beta-O-4 dehydrodimers identified from the caffeic acid and sinapic acid cross-coupling reaction are known materials that are highly abundant in plants.

16438318,"Acrylamide is formed in high-carbohydrate foods during high temperature processes such as frying, baking, roasting and extrusion. Although acrylamide is known to form during industrial processing of food, high levels of the chemical have been found in home-cooked foods, mainly potato- and grain-based products. This chapter will focus on the effects of cooking conditions (e.g. time/temperature) on acrylamide formation in consumer-prepared foods, the use of surface color (browning) as an indicator of acrylamide levels in some foods, and methods for reducing acrylamide levels in home-prepared foods. As with commercially processed foods, acrylamide levels in home-prepared foods tend to increase with cooking time and temperature. In experiments conducted at the NCFST, we found that acrylamide levels in cooked food depended greatly on the cooking conditions and the degree of ""doneness"", as measured by the level of surface browning. For example, French fries fried at 150-190 degrees C for up to 10 min had acrylamide levels of 55 to 2130 microg/kg (wet weight), with the highest levels in the most processed (highest frying times/temperatures) and the most highly browned fries. Similarly, more acrylamide was formed in ""dark"" toasted bread slices (43.7-610.7 microg/kg wet weight), than ""light"" (8.27-217.5 microg/kg) or ""medium"" (10.9-213.7 microg/kg) toasted slices. Analysis of the surface color by colorimetry indicated that some components of surface color (""a"" and ""L"" values) correlated highly with acrylamide levels. This indicates that the degree of surface browning could be used as an indicator of acrylamide formation during cooking. Soaking raw potato slices in water before frying was effective at reducing acrylamide levels in French fries. Additional studies are needed to develop practical methods for reducing acrylamide formation in home-prepared foods without changing the acceptability of these foods.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"['D020106', 'D000178', 'D002241', 'D002853', 'D003296', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D019649', 'D006358', 'D013058', 'D008956', 'D035281', 'D011198', 'D013696', 'D013997']","['Acrylamide', 'Acrylamides', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cooking', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Food Industry', 'Hot Temperature', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Models, Chemical', 'Plant Tubers', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",Effects of consumer food preparation on acrylamide formation.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16438318,2006

16438312,"The discovery of acrylamide in processed potato products has brought increased interest in the controlling Maillard reaction precursors (reducing sugars and amino acids) in potato tubers. Because of their effects on nonenzymatic browning of fried potato products, reducing sugars and amino acids have been the focus of many potato research and breeding programs. This study focused on changes in sugars and amino acids in diploid potatoes selected for their storage qualities and their effect on acrylamide formation in the fried product. In addition, a second study was performed using cultivated lines that evaluated the effect of nitrogen fertilization on amino acid levels in tubers. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, and asparagine concentrations in tubers increased upon storage at 2 degrees C. Glucose and fructose concentrations in the tubers were significantly and positively correlated with subsequent acrylamide formation in the products.

16438310,"We previously reported that in potato chip and French fry models, the formation of acrylamide can be reduced by controlling pH during processing steps, either by organic (acidulants) or inorganic acids. Use of phytate, a naturally occurring chelator, with or without Ca++ (or divalent ions), can reduce acrylamide formation in both models. However, since phytate itself is acidic, the question remains as to whether the effect of phytate is due to pH alone or to additional effects. In the French fry model, the effects on acrylamide formation of pH, phytate, and/or Ca++ in various combinations were tested in either blanching or soaking (after blanching) steps. All treatments significantly reduced acrylamide levels compared to control. Among variables tested, pH may be the single most important factor for reducing acrylamide levels, while there were independent effects of phytate and/or Ca++ in this French fry model.

The present paper summarizes our follow-up studies on the characterization of parameters that influence the formation and degradation of acrylamide in heated foods. The system designed and used for studies of the influence of added factors was primarily homogenized potato heated in an oven. The net content of acrylamide after heating was examined with regard to the following parameters: heating temperature, duration of heating, pH and concentrations of various components. Higher temperature (200 degrees C) combined with prolonged heating led to reduced levels of acrylamide, due to elimination/degradation processes. At certain concentrations, the presence of asparagine or monosaccharides (in particular fructose, glucose and glyceraldehyde) was found to increase the net content of acrylamide. Addition of other free amino acids or a protein-rich food component strongly reduced the acrylamide content, probably by promoting competing reactions and/or covalently binding of formed acrylamide. The pH-dependence of acrylamide formation exhibited a maximum around pH 8; lower pH enhanced elimination and decelerated formation of acrylamide. In contrast, the effects of additions of antioxidants or peroxides on acrylamide content were not significant.

This 60-kD protein has a blocked N terminus. Three tryptic peptides of the protein were isolated and sequenced using tandem mass spectroscopy. These unique peptides were found to be similar to the xyloglucan-specific fungal endoglucanase inhibitor protein (XEGIP) precursor in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and its homolog in potato (Solanum tuberosum). A pair of oligonucleotide primers was designed based on the potato and tomato sequences that were used to clone a 1,018-bp internal piece of nec4 cDNA from a stage 6 nectary cDNA library. The remaining portions of the cDNA were subsequently captured by 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Complete sequencing of the nec4 cDNA demonstrated that it belonged to a large family of homologous proteins from a wide variety of angiosperms. Related proteins include foliage proteins and seed storage proteins. Based upon conserved identity with the wheat (Triticum aestivum) xylanase inhibitor TAXI-1, we were able to develop a protein model that showed that NEC4 contains additional amino acid loops that are not found in TAXI-1 and that glycosylation sites are surface exposed. Both these loops and sites of glycosylation are on the opposite face of the NEC4 molecule from the site that interacts with fungal hemicellulases, as indicated by homology to TAXI-I. NEC4 also contains a region homologous to the TAXI-1 knottin domain; however, a deletion in this domain restructures the disulfide bridges of this domain, resulting in a pseudoknottin domain. Inhibition assays were performed to determine whether purified NEC4 was able to inhibit fungal endoglucanases and xylanases. These studies showed that NEC4 was a very effective inhibitor of a family GH12 xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase with a K(i) of 0.35 nm. However, no inhibitory activity was observed against other family GH10 or GH11 xylanases. The patterns of expression of the NEC4 protein indicate that, while expressed in nectar at anthesis, it is most strongly expressed in the nectary gland after fertilization, indicating that inhibition of fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes may be more important after fertilization than before.",Plant physiology,"['D000595', 'D002480', 'D002851', 'D003001', 'D018076', 'D018506', 'D006031', 'D008958', 'D008969', 'D010802', 'D010940', 'D011487', 'D012333', 'D016415', 'D019032', 'D014026']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cellulase', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Glycosylation', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Proteins', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tobacco']","Nectarin IV, a potent endoglucanase inhibitor secreted into the nectar of ornamental tobacco plants.

Marigold flower, a good rotation crop for the control of nematodes in tobacco fields was found to contain 0.77% lutein (after saponification, on dry basis). A high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method using a two-phase solvent system consisting of hexane-ethanol-water (6:4.5:1.5, v/v/v) was developed for the purification of lutein from the saponification mixture of marigold flower extract. The purity of lutein prepared using this HSCCC method was 97%. Free lutein was found to be the predominant form in three squash varieties, and it was mostly found in the peel rather than the commonly consumed flesh. Sweet Mamma, Buttercup and Pepper squash varieties contained 25.4, 18.4 and 30.1mg/100g fresh weigh (FW) of lutein in the peels, respectively. These concentrations were significantly higher than that in spinach and kale (3.7 and 12.3 mg/100 g FW). beta-Carotene was found most in the peel of Sweet Mamma squash at 13.6 mg/100g FW, whereas it was below 2mg/100g FW in all other samples. Cooking increased extractable free lutein by 22-65% in squash peels. Lutein in Yukon Gold potato was at ca. 0.4 mg/100 g FW. Certain Yukon Gold was also found to contain violaxanthin (0.35 mg/100 g FW). Structures of lutein, beta-carotene and violaxanthin were identified by LC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization MS in positive ion mode, and by comparing the retention time and UV-vis spectral data with standards. Results from this study suggest the selected crops and agri-food industrial processing by-products of these can be a good source of free lutein.",Journal of chromatography.

16205940,"Simon extracts are vitamin K(1)-rich food materials extracted from the leaves of the Simon sweet potato. Although vitamin K is known to stimulate bone formation, we postulated that Simon extracts also contain unknown biological compounds having the ability to regulate bone resorption. Here we prepared the vitamin K-free fraction from the Simon extracts and investigated the ability of this fraction on the differentiation of osteoclasts. A remarkable inhibitory effect of osteoclastogenesis was observed when osteoclast precursors were treated with this fraction in rat bone marrow culture systems as well as in a pure differentiation system using murine osteoclast precursor cell line. The vitamin K-free Simon extracts markedly suppressed severe bone destruction mediated by abundant osteoclasts associated with adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that the vitamin K-free Simon extracts contained three types of low molecular weight inhibitors for osteoclastogenesis; caffeic acid, chlorogenic acids and isochlorogenic acids. Among these substances, caffeic acid showed the most powerful inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis. Caffeic acid significantly suppressed expression of NFATc1, a key transcription factor for the induction of osteoclastogenesis.

16152941,"A simple and inexpensive liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method was developed for the quantitation of acrylamide in various food products. The method involved spiking the isotope-substituted internal standard (1-C13 acrylamide) onto 6.00 g of the food product, adding 40 mL distilled/deionized water, and heating at 65 degrees C for 30 min. Afterwards, 10 mL ethylene dichloride was added and the mixture was homogenized for 30 s and centrifuged at 2700 x g for 30 min, and then 8 g supernatant was extracted with 10, 5, and 5 mL portions of ethyl acetate. The extracts were combined, dried with sodium sulfate, and concentrated to 100-200 microL. Acrylamide was determined by analysis of the final extract on a single quadrupole, bench-top mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization, using a 2 mm id C18 column and monitoring m/z = 72 (acrylamide) and m/z = 73 (internal standard). For difficult food matrixes, such as coffee and cocoa, a solid-phase extraction cleanup step was incorporated to improve both chromatography and column lifetime. The method had a limit of quantitation of 10 ppb, and coefficients of determination (r2) for calibration curves were typically better than 0.998. Acceptable spike recovery results were achieved in 11 different food matrixes. Precision in potato chip analyses was 5-8% (relative standard deviation).

The acrylamide content in chips began to increase after 3 days of storage at 2 degrees C in response to the increase of glucose and fructose contents in the tubers. There was strong correlation between the reducing sugar content and acrylamide level, R(2)=0.873 for fructose and R(2)=0.836 for glucose. The sucrose content had less correlation with the acrylamide content because of its decrease after 4 weeks of storage at 2 degrees C, while the reducing sugar in potato tubers and the acrylamide in chips continued to increase. The contents of the four amino acids, i.e., asparatic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid and glutamine, showed no significant correlation with the acrylamide level.

15995980,"A rapid, reliable method has been developed for the multi-residue analysis of aniline metabolites of chlorpropham in potato samples. The method involves the precolumn derivatization of aniline metabolites with 5-(4,6-dichloro-s-triazin-2-ylamino) fluorescein (DTAF) and their subsequent separation and determination by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography with laser-induced fluorescence detection (MEKC-LIF). The optimum procedure includes a derivatization step of the aniline metabolites (3-chloroaniline, 3-chloro-4-hydroxyaniline and 3-chloro-4-methoxyaniline) at 40 degrees C for 40 min and a 5-fold dilution prior to MEKC analysis, which is conducted within about 7 min using negative-charged mixed micelles (SDS/Triton X-100) in the running buffer.

15675804,"The influence of the addition of carbohydrates with different physicochemical properties on weight loss and formation of heterocyclic amines (HAs) during the frying of beef burgers was examined. Furthermore, the capability of carbohydrates to bind HAs was tested. Beef burgers containing 1.5% NaCl and 0.3% tripolyphosphate (reference), with the addition of 1.5% carbohydrate, were fried for 5 min at 200 degrees C in a double-sided pan fryer. The beef burgers were analyzed for HAs with solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. 2-Amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyl-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), and 9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (Norharman) were detected in all of the beef burgers. The addition of carbohydrates affected both the weight loss and the formation of HAs during cooking. The formation of HAs could be correlated to depend on both the weight loss and the type of the added carbohydrate. Of the 11 different carbohydrates tested, raw potato starch was most capable of inhibiting the formation of HAs, while potato fiber gave the lowest weight loss and a comparably low amount of PhIP. Wheat bran and potato fiber were found to reversibly bind HAs. It is concluded that adding small amounts of certain carbohydrates may be a simple and effective way of reducing the amount of HAs and can easily be applied in households and commercial preparations of beef burgers.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002241', 'D002417', 'D055598', 'D002627', 'D004043', 'D006571', 'D006358', 'D008460', 'D011810', 'D011198', 'D013213']","['Animals', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cattle', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Heterocyclic Compounds', 'Hot Temperature', 'Meat', 'Quinoxalines', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Starch']",Addition of various carbohydrates to beef burgers affects the formation of heterocyclic amines during frying.,"[None, 'Q000008', None, None, None, 'Q000008', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000008']","[None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15675804,2005

15479016,"HPLC was used to analyze the content of ascorbic acid (AA) in tubers of four Korean potato cultivars (Chaju, Sumi, Deso, and Dejima), in a series of baked, boiled, braised, fried, microwaved, pressure-cooked, and sauteed potato slices from the Dejima cultivar and in 14 commercial Korean and 14 processed potato foods sold in the United States (chips, snacks, mashed potatoes, fries). The AA content for the four cultivars ranged from 16 to 46 mg/100 g of fresh weight. The distribution of AA in each of the eight potato slices (sticks, plugs) cut horizontally from the stem end of the Dejima potato ranged from 6.8 to 19.3% of the total. The corresponding distribution in seven sticks cut vertically was much narrower, ranging from 11.7 to 17.5% of the total. Losses of AA in water (pH 5.2) were significantly greater than in 5% metaphosphoric acid (pH 1.0). Less degradation occurred in water solutions of the vitamin stored at 1 degree C than at 25 degrees C. Losses of AA observed during home-processing of three varieties with low (Dejima, 16 mg/100 g), intermediate (Sumi, 32 mg/100 g), and high (Chaju, 42 mg/100 g) AA contents were as follows: boiling in water, 77-88%; boiling in water containing 1-3% NaCl, 61-79%; frying in oil, 55-79%; sauteing, 61-67%; pressure-cooking in water, 56-60%; braising, 50-63%; baking, 33-51%; and microwaving, 21-33%.

These results permit optimization of the vitamin C content of the diet by (a) using high-vitamin C potato varieties such as Chaju, (b) selecting sticks cut horizontally for frying, (c) baking or microwaving rather than boiling or frying, and (d) selecting commercial potato foods with a high vitamin C content.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001205', 'D002851', 'D004355', 'D005511', 'D010084', 'D035281', 'D011198']","['Ascorbic Acid', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Stability', 'Food Handling', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plant Tubers', 'Solanum tuberosum']",Distribution of ascorbic acid in potato tubers and in home-processed and commercial potato foods.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15479016,2004
15378368,"Native and wound periderm was isolated enzymatically from potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Desirée) tubers at different time intervals between 0 days up to 4 weeks after harvesting. Wound periderm formation was induced by carefully removing native periderm from freshly harvested tubers before storage. The chemical composition of lipids (waxes) obtained by chloroform extraction, as well as the monomeric composition of native and wound suberin polymer after transesterification by boron trifluoride/methanol, was analyzed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Both types of periderm contained up to 20% extractable lipids. Besides linear long-chain aliphatic wax compounds, alkyl ferulates were detected as significant constituents. In wound periderm they amounted to more than 60% of the total extracts. Within 1 month of storage, suberin amounts in the polymer increased 2-fold in native periderm (180 microg cm(-2)), whereas in wound periderm about 75.0 microg cm(-2) suberin polymer was newly synthesized. Native potato tuber periderm developed a very efficient transport barrier for water with permeances decreasing from 6.4 x 10(-10) m s(-1) to 5.5 x 10(-11) m s(-1) within 1 month of storage. However, the water permeability of wound periderm was on average 100 times higher with permeances decreasing from 4.7 x 10(-8) m s(-1) after 3 days to only 5.4 x 10(-9) m s(-1) after 1 month of storage, although suberin and wax amounts in wound periderm amounted to about 60% of native periderm. From this result it must be concluded that the occurrence of suberin with wax depositions in cell walls does not necessarily allow us to conclude that these cell walls must be nearly perfect barriers to water transport. In addition to the occurrence of the lipophilic biopolymer suberin and associated waxes, the still unknown molecular arrangement and precisely localized deposition of suberin within the cell wall must contribute to the efficiency of suberin as a barrier to water transport.",Planta,"['D007700', 'D008055', 'D008563', 'D010935', 'D018517', 'D018526', 'D011198', 'D017550', 'D014885']","['Kinetics', 'Lipids', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Plant Diseases', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Transpiration', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Waxes']",Wax and suberin development of native and wound periderm of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and its relation to peridermal transpiration.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000166', 'Q000502', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'cytology', 'physiology', 'cytology', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15378368,2005

15183015,"Acrylamide (ACR) is a water-soluble, vinyl monomer that has multiple chemical and industrial applications: e.g., waste water management, ore processing. In addition, ACR is used extensively in molecular laboratories for gel chromatography and is present in certain foods that have been prepared at very high temperatures. Extensive studies in rodents and other laboratory animals have provided evidence that exposure to monomeric ACR causes cellular damage in both the nervous and reproductive systems, and produces tumors in certain hormonally responsive tissues. Whereas human epidemiological studies have demonstrated a significantly elevated incidence of neurotoxicity in occupationally exposed populations, such research has not, to date, revealed a corresponding increase in cancer risk. Since the announcement by a Swedish research group in April 2002 [J. Ag. Food Chem. 50 (2002) 4998] regarding the presence of ACR in potato and grain-based foods, there has been a renewed interest in the toxic actions of this chemical. Therefore, in this review, we consider the different toxic effects of ACR. The neurotoxic actions of ACR will be the focal point since neurotoxicity is a consequence of both human and laboratory animal exposure and since this area of investigation has received considerable attention over the past 30 years. As will be discussed, a growing body of evidence now indicates that the nerve terminal is a primary site of ACR action and that inhibition of corresponding membrane-fusion processes impairs neurotransmitter release and promotes eventual degeneration. The electrophilic nature of ACR suggests that this neurotoxicant adducts nucleophilic sulfhydryl groups on certain proteins that are critically involved in membrane fusion. Adduction of thiol groups also might be common to the reproductive and carcinogenic effects of ACR. A final goal of this review is to identify data gaps that retard a comprehensive understanding of ACR pathophysiological processes.",Neurotoxicology,"['D020106', 'D000818', 'D002273', 'D004785', 'D006801', 'D020258']","['Acrylamide', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Humans', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes']",The changing view of acrylamide neurotoxicity.,"['Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","['metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15183015,2004

In potato shapes with low SVR, acrylamide content consistently increased with increasing temperature and processing times. By contrast, in shapes with intermediate to high SVR, maximal acrylamide formation occurred at 160-180 degrees C, while higher temperatures or prolonged processing times caused a decrease of acrylamide levels.

15096512,"The oomycetes form one of several lineages within the eukaryotes that independently evolved a parasitic lifestyle and consequently are thought to have developed alternative mechanisms of pathogenicity. The oomycete Phytophthora infestans causes late blight, a ravaging disease of potato and tomato. Little is known about processes associated with P. infestans pathogenesis, particularly the suppression of host defense responses. We describe and functionally characterize an extracellular protease inhibitor, EPI1, from P. infestans. EPI1 contains two domains with significant similarity to the Kazal family of serine protease inhibitors. Database searches suggested that Kazal-like proteins are mainly restricted to animals and apicomplexan parasites but appear to be widespread and diverse in the oomycetes. Recombinant EPI1 specifically inhibited subtilisin A among major serine proteases and inhibited and interacted with the pathogenesis-related P69B subtilisin-like serine protease of tomato in intercellular fluids.

Inhibition of tomato proteases by EPI1 could form a novel type of defense-counterdefense mechanism between plants and microbial pathogens.

The extract was passed through an OASIS HLB cartridge and the eluate was injected into the HPLC system using a column-switching technique. The HPLC system consisted of two pumps, two 6-port-2-position valves, two columns and a UV detector. At first, the sample solution was chromatographed on an ODS column with a mobile phase of water, then the flow of the mobile phase was switched using a 6-port-2-position valve, and the acrylamide peak fraction was introduced into an aqueous gel permeation column (analytical column). The fraction was chromatographed again on the analytical column with a mobile phase of water, and the eluate was monitored with a UV detector (205 nm). The recoveries of acrylamide from potato chips, fried potato, croquette and instant noodle fortified at levels of 50 to 1,000 micrograms/kg were 93.1 to 101.5% and the coefficient of variation was 1.5 to 5.2%.

15036012,"Although both non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and resistant starches (RS) are included in current definitions of dietary fibre, our previous work has suggested fundamental differences in the way in which these two classes of material affect the disposition and absorption of a dietary carcinogen. The present studies explore whether different effects on carcinogen metabolism could play a role in the contrasting patterns seen previously. Groups of female Wistar rats were pre-fed for 4 weeks one of five types of defined diet (AIN-76). The control diet contained 35% maize starch and no dietary fibre. The RS-containing diets had all the maize starch substituted with either Hi-maize or potato starch. In the NSP-containing diets, 10% of the maize starch was substituted with dietary fibre in the form of either lignified plant cell walls (wheat straw) or soluble dietary fibre (apple pectin). Pre-fed rats were gavaged with the food carcinogen, [2-14C] 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), and plasma and urinary metabolites characterized using HPLC at various time intervals after administration. After 4 h gavage, plasma from rats on both RS-containing diets contained significantly higher levels of intact IQ and lower levels of the major metabolites, IQ-5-O-glucuronide and IQ-5-sulfate, as compared with plasma from the negative control group at this time. In contrast, plasma from animals on the NSP-containing wheat straw diet (and to a lesser extent the apple pectin diet) showed significantly lower levels of intact IQ, and significantly higher levels of the two major metabolites, as compared with those from the control rats. These different metabolite profiles were also reflected in different urinary excretion profiles. Urine from rats pre-fed RS-containing diets revealed significantly slower metabolite excretion as compared with urine from rats that had been given the NSP-containing diets. Western blotting methodologies also profiled differences between the effects of these two types of dietary fibre in the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. We conclude that changes in activity and expression of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes could play a role in the contrasting effects of these two types of dietary fibre on carcinogen uptake and disposition.","Journal of chromatography.

On growth media such as malt extract agar and potato dextrose agar, it was found that trichodiene was produced by toxigenic strains of Fusarium sambucinum and Fusarium sporotrichioides. It was the main volatile metabolite in the headspace extract of the cultures. On the other hand, deoxynivalenol producing Fusarium graminearum showed a completely different pattern of volatile sesquiterpenes and could easily be distinguished from a zearalenone producing strain of F. graminearum based on the headspace profile.

14769478,"We have previously reported that polysaccharides extracted from fruiting bodies or cultured mycelia of Antrodia camphorata exhibit an anti-hepatitis B virus effect. In this study, we intended to elucidate the anti-inflammatory potency of six mycelial extracts, namely PDB-ext, CK-ext, CM-ext, CO-ext, CC-ext, and CKO-ext, isolated from mycelia of A. camphorata cultured with six different media including potato dextrose broth (PDB) and five water-soluble fractions from the wood of different Cinnamomum species, i.e. C. kanehirae (CK), C. micranthum (CM), C. osmophloeum (CO), C. camphora (CC), and C. kotoense (CKO), against reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in peripheral human neutrophils (PMN) or mononuclear cells (MNC). ROS produced by PMN or MNC act as inflammatory mediators and also signal immune responses. Pretreatment with these mycelial extracts (1-50 microg ml(-1)) concentration-dependently diminished fMLP- or PMA-induced ROS production in PMN or MNC, as measured by lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence, with 50% inhibition concentrations (IC(50)) ranging from 2 to 20 microg ml(-1). Among these extracts evaluated, CM-ext, CO-ext, or CKO-ext exhibited higher potency than the others. Using high performance liquid chromatography, we identified two lanostane-type compounds, i.e. dehydrosulfurenic acid and 15alpha-acetyl-dehydrosulfurenic acid, which could be involved in the anti-inflammatory actions of these extracts. The anti-inflammatory actions of these extracts were not due to cytotoxic effects. In summary, these data suggest that extracts from cultured mycelia of A. camphorata display anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting ROS production in human leukocytes at a pharmacologically applicable concentration.

In the present study, a protein termed tobacco RIP (TRIP) was isolated from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves and purified using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography in combination with yeast ribosome depurination assays. TRIP has a molecular mass of 26 kD as evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and showed strong N-glycosidase activity as manifested by the depurination of yeast rRNA. Purified TRIP showed immunoreactivity with antibodies of RIPs from Mirabilis expansa. TRIP released fewer amounts of adenine residues from ribosomal (Artemia sp. and rat ribosomes) and non-ribosomal substrates (herring sperm DNA, rRNA, and tRNA) compared with other RIPs. TRIP inhibited translation in wheat (Triticum aestivum) germ more efficiently than in rabbit reticulocytes, showing an IC50 at 30 ng in the former system. Antimicrobial assays using highly purified TRIP (50 microg mL(-1)) conducted against various fungi and bacterial pathogens showed the strongest inhibitory activity against Trichoderma reesei and Pseudomonas solancearum. A 15-amino acid internal polypeptide sequence of TRIP was identical with the internal sequences of the iron-superoxide dismutase (Fe-SOD) from wild tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia), Arabidopsis, and potato (Solanum tuberosum).

14667708,"Eight commercial starches, including common corn, waxy corn, wheat, tapioca, potato, Hylon V, Hylon VII, and mung bean starch, were annealed by a multiple-step process, and their gelatinization characteristics were determined. Annealed starches had higher gelatinization temperatures, reduced gelatinization ranges, and increased gelatinization enthalpies than their native starches. The annealed starches with the highest gelatinization enthalpies were subjected to acid hydrolysis with 15.3% H2SO4, and Naegeli dextrins were prepared after 10 days' hydrolysis. Annealing increased the acid susceptibility of native starches in the first (rapid) and the second (slow) phases with potato starch showing the greatest and high amylose starches showing the least changes. Starches with a larger shift in onset gelatinization temperature also displayed a greater percent hydrolysis. The increase in susceptibility to acid hydrolysis was proposed to result from defective and porous structures that resulted after annealing. Although annealing perfected the crystalline structure, it also produced void space, which led to porous structures and possible starch granule defects. The molecular size distribution and chain length distribution of Naegeli dextrins of annealed and native starches were analyzed. The reorganization of the starch molecule during annealing occurred mainly within the crystalline lamellae. Imperfect double helices in the crystalline lamellae improved after annealing, and the branch linkages at the imperfect double helices became protected by the improved crystalline structure.

Several kinds of foods (industrially produced) representing different food/product groups available on the Swedish market have been analysed for acrylamide. A considerable variation in levels of acrylamide between single foodstuffs (different brands) within food categories were found, which also applies for levels in different food categories. Using recent Swedish food consumption data the dietary intake of acrylamide for the Swedish adult population was assessed based on foodstuffs with low to high levels of acrylamide (<30-2300 microg/kg), such as processed potato products, bread, breakfast cereals, biscuits, cookies, snacks and coffee. The estimated dietary intake of acrylamide per person (total population) given as the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile were 9.1, 27 and 62 microg/day respectively, from those food/product groups (mean 31 microg/day). No acrylamide was found in many other foodstuffs analysed and those were therefore not included in the dietary intake assessment of acrylamide.

12963010,"At the end of April 2002, the Swedish Food Administration reported the presence of acrylamide in heat treated food products. Acrylamide has been shown to be toxic and carcinogenic in animals, and has been classified by the WHO/IARC among others as 'probably carcinogenic for humans'. The purposes of this study were firstly to analyse acrylamide contents of the most important foods contributing to such exposure, secondly, to estimate the acrylamide exposure in a representative sample of the Dutch population, and thirdly to estimate the public health risks of this consumption. We analysed the acrylamide content of foods with an LC-MS-MS method. The results were then used to estimate the acrylamide exposure of consumers who participated in the National Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) in 1998 (n=6250). The exposure was estimated using the probabilistic approach for the total Dutch population and several age groups. For 344 food products, acrylamide amounts ranged from <30 to 3100 microg/kg. Foods with the highest mean acrylamide amounts were potato crisps (1249 microg/kg), chips (deep-fried) (351 microg/kg), cocktail snacks (1060 microg/kg), and gingerbread (890 microg/kg). The mean acrylamide exposure of the NFCS participants was 0.48 microg/kg bw/day. Risk of neurotoxicity is negligible.

The nitrate () and nitrite () contents of various vegetables (Chinese cabbage, radish, lettuce, spinach, soybean sprouts, onion, pumpkin, green onion, cucumber, potato, carrot, garlic, green pepper, cabbage and Allium tuberosum Roth known as Crown daisy) are reported. Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables. The average nitrite contents in various vegetables were about 0.6 mg kg(-1), and the values were not significantly different among most vegetables. It was observed that nitrate contents in vegetables varied depending on the type of vegetables and were similar to those in vegetables grown in other countries. From the results of our studies and other information from foreign sources, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to establish limits of nitrates contents of vegetables cultivated in Korea due to the co-presence of beneficial elements such as ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol which are known to inhibit the formation of nitrosamine.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000490', 'D001530', 'D001937', 'D002212', 'D002852', 'D004032', 'D006801', 'D007391', 'D007723', 'D009566', 'D009573', 'D019697', 'D031224', 'D012621', 'D013025', 'D013056', 'D006113', 'D014675']","['Allium', 'Belgium', 'Brassica', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Diet', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Korea', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrites', 'Onions', 'Raphanus', 'Seasons', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'United Kingdom', 'Vegetables']",Survey of nitrate and nitrite contents of vegetables grown in Korea.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'adverse effects', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12888387,2003

AA was extracted with a mixture of water and acetone from homogenized food samples after the addition of 13C-labeled acrylamide (AA-1-(13)C) as an internal standard. The extract was concentrated, washed with dichloromethane for defatting, and cleaned up on Bond Elut C18, PSA and ACCUCAT cartridge-columns, and then AA was determined by LC/MS in the selected ion recording (SIR) mode. For the LC/MS analysis, four LC columns were connected in-line and the flow of the mobile phase was switched according to a time-program. Monitoring ions for AA were m/z 72 and 55, and those for AA-1-(13)C were m/z 73 and 56. AA and AA-1-(13)C were determined without interference from the matrices in all samples. The recoveries of AA from potato chips, corn snack, pretzel and roasted tea spiked at the level of 500 ng/g of AA were 99.5-101.0% with standard deviations (SD) in the range from 0.3 to 1.6%. The limits of detection and quantification of the developed method were 9 and 30 ng/g for AA in samples, respectively. The method was applied to the analysis of AA in various processed or cooked food samples purchased from retail markets. High levels of AA were found in potato chips and French-fried potato (467-3,544 ng/g). Fried and sugar-coated dough cakes (karinto) contained 374 and 1,895 ng/g.

The optimised MISPE procedure was applied to the extraction of the selected triazines in pea, potato, and corn sample extracts and a high degree of clean-up was obtained. However, some remaining interferences, non-specifically and strongly bound to the polymeric matrix, appeared in the chromatogram, preventing quantification of DIA in potatoes and DIA, DEA, and propazine in corn samples. Thus, a new clean-up protocol based on the use of a non-imprinted polymer for removal of these interferences prior to the MISPE step was developed.

However, the implications of contamination of agricultural soils from long-term irrigation with As-contaminated groundwater for phyto-accumulation in food crops, and thence dietary exposure to As, and other metals, has not been assessed previously in Bangladesh. Various vegetables were sampled in Samta village in the Jessore district of Bangladesh, and screened for As, Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). These local food products are the basis of human nutrition in this region and of great relevance to human health. The results revealed that the individual vegetables containing the highest mean As concentrations microg x g(-1)) are snake gourd (0.489), ghotkol (0.446), taro (0.440), green papaya (0.389), elephant foot (0.338) and Bottle ground leaf (0.306), respectively. The As concentration in fleshy vegetable material is low. In general, the data show the potential for some vegetables to accumulate heavy metals with concentrations of Pb greater than Cd. Some vegetables such as bottle ground leaf, ghotkol, taro, eddoe and elephant foot had much higher concentrations of Pb. Other leafy and root vegetables, contained higher concentrations of Zn and Cu. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) values, based on dry weight, were below 1 for all metals. In most cases, BCF values decreased with increasing metal concentrations in the soil. From the heavily As-contaminated village in Samta, BCF values for As in ladies finger, potato, ash gourd, brinjal, green papaya, ghotkol and snake gourd were 0.001, 0.006, 0.006, 0.014, 0.030, 0.034 and 0.038, respectively. Considering the average daily intake of fresh vegetables per person per day is only 130 g, all the vegetables grown at Samta had Pb concentrations that would be a health hazard for human consumption.

12643640,"Solanidine is a steroidal aglycon of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) glycoalkaloids and a very important precursor for the synthesis of hormones and some pharmacologically active compounds. Glycoalkaloids are hydrolyzed by mineral acid, yielding solanidine. This paper deals with the kinetics of solanidine hydrolytic extraction in different solid-liquid-liquid systems. The dried and milled potato (S. tuberosum L.) vines were used as a source of glycoalkaloids and as the solid phase. The solutions of hydrochloric acid in 2 and 10% (w/v) aqueous acetic acid, in 50% (volume) aqueous methanol, and in 50% (volume) aqueous ethanol were first liquid phase, and the medium for glycoalkaloid extraction from potato vines and their hydrolysis to solanidine. The chloroform, trichloroethylene, or carbon tetrachloride were the second, organic, liquid phase and the medium for solanidine extraction. This procedure combines three different processes: extraction of glycoalkaloids from potato vines, their hydrolysis to solanidine, and the extraction of solanidine, in a single step. The term hydrolytic extraction of solanidine was used for these processes. The purpose of the paper was to choose an optimal solid-liquid-liquid system for solanidine extraction and to define the procedure for its isolation from the organic liquid phase. The best degree of solanidine hydrolytic extraction (DHE) of more than 98% was achieved when 10% (w/v) hydrochloric acid in 50% (volume) methanol were the first liquid phase and chloroform was the second liquid phase, after 90 min. The yield of solanidine (q(S)) under these conditions is calculated to be 0.24 g/100 g of potato vines. Approximately 78% of the maximal possible yield of solanidine was isolated from chlorofom liquid phase.

In GM tubers the expression level of the G1-1 gene, which regulates transition from dormancy to sprouting tubers, was inhibited by antisense technology. The analysis of antisense transformed lines showed that several of them exhibited a significant delay in sprouting relative to the control lines, in accordance with a decrease in the transcript level. Preliminary attempts to compare the protein patterns obtained from transformed and control lines using traditional electrophoresis were not able to reveal differences in the low-kDa range. Instead, MALDI-TOFMS applied to total peptide extract without any purification was able to distinguish spectral patterns of transformed and untransformed lines.

12172021,"Amyloses with distinct molecular masses are found in the starch of pea embryos compared with the starch of pea leaves. In pea embryos, a granule-bound starch synthase protein (GBSSIa) is required for the synthesis of a significant portion of the amylose. However, this protein seems to be insignificant in the synthesis of amylose in pea leaves. cDNA clones encoding a second isoform of GBSSI, GBSSIb, have been isolated from pea leaves. Comparison of GBSSIa and GBSSIb activities shows them to have distinct properties. These differences have been confirmed by the expression of GBSSIa and GBSSIb in the amylose-free mutant of potato. GBSSIa and GBSSIb make distinct forms of amylose that differ in their molecular mass. These differences in product specificity, coupled with differences in the tissues in which GBSSIa and GBSSIb are most active, explain the distinct forms of amylose found in different tissues of pea. The shorter form of amylose formed by GBSSIa confers less susceptibility to the retrogradation of starch pastes than the amylose formed by GBSSIb.

12166997,"Reaction products (adducts) of acrylamide with N termini of hemoglobin (Hb) are regularly observed in persons without known exposure. The average Hb adduct level measured in Swedish adults is preliminarily estimated to correspond to a daily intake approaching 100 microg of acrylamide. Because this uptake rate could be associated with a considerable cancer risk, it was considered important to identify its origin. It was hypothesized that acrylamide was formed at elevated temperatures in cooking, which was indicated in earlier studies of rats fed fried animal feed. This paper reports the analysis of acrylamide formed during heating of different human foodstuffs. Acrylamide levels in foodstuffs were analyzed by an improved gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method after bromination of acrylamide and by a new method for measurement of the underivatized acrylamide by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), using the MS/MS mode. For both methods the reproducibility, given as coefficient of variation, was approximately 5%, and the recovery close to 100%. For the GC-MS method the achieved detection level of acrylamide was 5 microg/kg and for the LC-MS/MS method, 10 microg/kg. The analytic values obtained with the LC-MS/MS method were 0.99 (0.95-1.04; 95% confidence interval) of the GC-MS values. The LC-MS/MS method is simpler and preferable for most routine analyses. Taken together, the various analytic data should be considered as proof of the identity of acrylamide. Studies with laboratory-heated foods revealed a temperature dependence of acrylamide formation. Moderate levels of acrylamide (5-50 microg/kg) were measured in heated protein-rich foods and higher contents (150-4000 microg/kg) in carbohydrate-rich foods, such as potato, beetroot, and also certain heated commercial potato products and crispbread. Acrylamide could not be detected in unheated control or boiled foods (<5 microg/kg). Consumption habits indicate that the acrylamide levels in the studied heated foods could lead to a daily intake of a few tens of micrograms.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D020106', 'D002273', 'D002853', 'D004032', 'D005504', 'D008401', 'D006454', 'D006358', 'D013058', 'D012307']","['Acrylamide', 'Carcinogens', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Diet', 'Food Analysis', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hemoglobins', 'Hot Temperature', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Risk Factors']","Analysis of acrylamide, a carcinogen formed in heated foodstuffs.","['Q000008', 'Q000008', None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None]","['administration & dosage', 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12166997,2002

Due to its non-cariogenicity and low calorific value it is an ideal sugar substitute for use in food production. Palatinose is produced on an industrial scale from sucrose by an enzymatic rearrangement using immobilized bacterial cells. To explore the potential of transgenic plants as alternative production facilities for palatinose, a chimeric sucrose isomerase gene from Erwinia rhapontici under control of a tuber-specific promoter was introduced into potato plants. The enzyme catalyses the conversion of sucrose into palatinose. Expression of the palI gene within the apoplast of transgenic tubers led to a nearly quantitative conversion of sucrose into palatinose. Despite the soluble carbohydrates having been altered within the tubers, growth of palI expressing transgenic potato plants was indistinguishable from wild type plants. Therefore, expression of a bacterial sucrose isomerase provides a valid tool for high level palatinose production in storage tissues of transgenic crop plants.",Journal of biotechnology,"['D019149', 'D002851', 'D003001', 'D007534', 'D011198']","['Bioreactors', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Isomaltose', 'Solanum tuberosum']",Potato tubers as bioreactors for palatinose production.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000031', 'Q000235']","[None, None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12142148,2002

Minimal processing caused an overall increase in PPO, POD, and PAL activities. The isoform pattern of PPO was the same for all of the cultivars before and after processing. No latent PPO was detected. The isoperoxidase pattern was approximately the same among cultivars. An increase in POD activity was related to the specific induction of an acidic isoperoxidase. PAL showed an induction pattern characterized by the presence of a maximum peak of activity after 4 days of processing for all of the cultivars. The sequence of browning susceptibility of potato cultivars was as follows: Monalisa > Spunta > Liseta > Cara > Agria. Browning development was only partially correlated to PAL activity (only during the first 4 days after wounding). However, this correlation could not explain the above sequence of browning susceptibility. Minimal processing caused an increase of chlorogenic acid, whereas tyrosine content remained unchanged.

On the basis of a number of publications, potato is considered to be a heat-labile allergen, but the molecular explanation for this behavior was not given. In this work, heat treatment of patatin in the absence and presence of other potato proteins mimicking the proteinaceous environment of the potato was studied. Using far-UV circular dichrosim spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry, the molecular transitions during heating of patatin were investigated. It was found that as long as patatin is not aggregated, denaturation of patatin on a secondary or tertiairy folding level is reversible with only a minor effect on the IgE affinity. Aggregation of patatin results in a nonreversible unfolding and a concomitant important decrease in affinity for IgE (25-fold). Aggregation of patatin in the presence of other potato proteins results in a less condensed aggregate compared to the situation of isolated patatin, resulting in a more pronounced decrease of affinity for IgE (110-fold).

To discover the causes of the fissuring, and thus to shed light on factors that influence starch granule morphology in general, SSIII antisense lines were compared with lines with reductions in the major granule-bound isoform of starch synthase (GBSS) and lines with reductions in activity of both SSIII and GBSS (SSIII/GBSS antisense lines). This revealed that fissuring resulted from the activity of GBSS in the SSIII antisense background. Control (untransformed) lines and GBSS and SSIII/GBSS antisense lines had unfissured granules. Starch analyses showed that granules from SSIII antisense tubers had a greater number of long glucan chains than did granules from the other lines, in the form of larger amylose molecules and a unique fraction of very long amylopectin chains. These are likely to result from increased flux through GBSS in SSIII antisense tubers, in response to the elevated content of ADP-glucose in these tubers.

11599982,"Dithiocarbamates are a class of fungicides extensively used in many crops worldwide. The current residue definition of dithiocarbamates in food for compliance with maximum residue limits, at national and international levels, is total residues arising from the use of any or each dithiocarbamate fungicide, determined as CS(2). The analytical method most frequently used to analyze dithiocarbamate residues in food for monitoring purposes was proposed more than 30 years ago. In this method, total dithiocarbamates are decomposed to CS(2), which is purified and reacted with a cupric reagent. The yellow complex formed is quantified by spectrophotometry. In this paper, a new reaction system for the purification and complexation of CS(2) is proposed. The new system is less fragile than the traditional design, is easier to assemble, and allows for a higher sample throughput, in addition to being of low cost. Recovery of added mancozeb, thiram, or ziram (0.15-8.0 mg/kg) in rice, beans, apple, banana, orange, papaya, tomato, cucumber, and potato ranged from 82 to 120%, with relative standard deviations from 0 to 10% (n = 3 or 5).

Most of these toxins were also isolated from M. verrucaria spores and mycelia grown on potato dextrose agar medium, including epiroridin E (32.3 mg/g), epiisororidin E (28.6 mg/g), roridin E (0 mg/g), roridin H (60 mg/g), trichoverrin A (1.3 mg/g), trichoverrin B (1.8 mg/g), verrucarin A (13.8 mg/g), and verrucarin J (131 mg/g). When M. verrucaria was cultured on liquid media, the numbers but not the amounts of toxins decreased. Only epiroridin E (28.3 mg/g), epiisororidin E (29.6 mg/g), verrucarin B (195 mg/g) and verrucarin J (52.6 mg/g) were measured when the fungus was cultured on cornsteep medium. On soyflour-cornmeal broth M. verrucaria produced several toxins, including epiroridin E (58.1 mg/g), epiisororidin E (5.8 mg/g), verrucarin B (29.9 mg/g) and verrucarin J (32 mg/g).

Purified macrocyclic trichothecenes (verrucarin A and T-2 toxin) were very cytotoxic to the same cell lines (< or = 2 ng/ml). These results show that neither intact macrocyclic trichothecenes nor toxic metabolites could be detected in plant tissues after treatment with M. verrucaria spores.

They were then infused with various combinations of sugars (glucose and/or fructose) and amino acids (asparagine, glutamine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and/or methionine) and fried. Volatile compounds were trapped onto Tenax prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Relative amounts of compounds (relative to the internal standard) and relative yields (per mole of amino acid infused into the slices) were determined. Amounts of 10 pyrazines, 4 Strecker aldehydes, and 4 other compounds were monitored. Relative amounts and relative yields of compounds varied according to the composition of the system. For the single amino acid-glucose systems, leucine gave the highest relative amount and relative yield of its Strecker aldehyde. Asparagine and phenylalanine gave the highest total relative amount and total relative yield, respectively, of pyrazines. In the system containing all of the amino acids and glucose, the relative amount of 3-methylbutanal was higher, whereas the amounts of the other monitored Strecker aldehydes were lower. Most of the relative amounts of individual pyrazines were lower compared to the glucose-asparagine system, whereas the total relative yield of pyrazines was lower, compared to all of the single amino acid-glucose mixtures. Addition of fructose to the mixed amino acid-glucose model system generated Strecker aldehydes and pyrazines in ratios that were more similar to those of untreated potato chips than to those from the same system but without fructose.

11513640,"Recently, transgenic potato plants were created with overexpression of the 14-3-3 protein derived from Cucurbita pepo. Detailed analysis of those plants suggested that the function of the isolated 14-3-3 isoform is in the control of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the plants. 14-3-3 protein overexpression gave rise to an increase in soluble sugar and catecholamine contents in both leaves and tubers. It is proposed that 14-3-3 protein affects carbohydrate metabolism in potato plants via regulation of catecholamine synthesis. Furthermore, genetically modified potato tubers with 14-3-3 protein overexpression showed changes in lipid content and composition. The transgenic potato tubers contained 69% more total fat compared to the wild-type plant. Separation of tuber lipids into polar and nonpolar fractions revealed that the transgenic potato tubers contained almost 3 times more nonpolar lipids than the control. Analysis of fatty acid composition, conducted by the means of gas chromatography, showed that linoleic acid was the main fatty acid present in the tubers of both modified and control potato plants.

Here we report a simple and reliable method for processing milligram quantities of dried plant material for the analysis of the carbon isotope composition of lipids, soluble sugars, starch and cellulose from the same sample. We evaluated three different starch preparation methods, namely (1) enzymatic hydrolysis by alpha-amylase, (2) solubilization by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) followed by precipitation with ethanol, and (3) partial hydrolysis by HCl followed by precipitation of the resulting dextrins by ethanol. Starch recovery for three commercially available native starches (from potato, rice and wheat) varied from 48 to 81% for the techniques based on precipitation, whereas the enzymatic technique exhibited yields between 99 and 105%. In addition, the DMSO and HCl techniques introduced a significant (13)C fractionation of up to 1.9 per thousand, while the carbon isotope composition of native starches analyzed after enzymatic digestion did not show any significant difference from that of untreated samples. The enzymatic starch preparation method was then incorporated into a protocol for determination of delta(13)C signatures of lipids, soluble carbohydrates, starch and crude cellulose. The procedure is based on methanol/chloroform/water extraction of dried and ground leaf material. After recovery of the chloroform phase (lipid fraction), the methanol/water phase was deionized by ion exchange (soluble carbohydrate fraction) and the pellet treated with heat-stable alpha-amylase (starch fraction). The remaining insoluble material was subjected to solvolysis by diglyme (cellulose fraction).

In organic farming, phosphate fertilizers are not used, which may in the long term result in lower Cd levels. In the present study, feed, kidney, liver, and manure from growing/finishing pigs raised conventionally and organically on the same farm were microwave-digested and analyzed for Cd by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Cd was also analyzed in soil and water. A quality control program was included. The organic pigs (n = 40) were raised outdoors and fed an organic feed; the conventional pigs (n = 40) were raised indoors and given a conventional feed. The Cd levels in organic and conventional feed were 39.9 microg/kg and 51.8 microg/kg, respectively. Organic feed contained 2% potato protein, which contributed 17% of the Cd content. Conventional feed contained 5% beet fiber, which contributed 38% of total Cd content. Both feeds contained vitamin-mineral mixtures with high levels of Cd: 991 microg/kg in organic and 589 microg/kg in conventional feed. There was a significant negative linear relationship between Cd concentration in kidney and kidney weight. There was no significant difference in liver Cd levels between organic and conventional pigs and the mean +/- SD was 15.4 +/- 3.0.

Total and free thiols and protease inhibitors were monitored before and after extrusion by colorimetric assays. Potato glycoalkaloids were analyzed by HPLC and by immunoassay. Extrusion reduced potato flake disulfide bonds; disulfide bonds were higher in samples containing added sulfur compounds.

Potatoes were baked in their skins prior to separating the skin and flesh and preparing extracts of the volatile flavor compounds using a modified Likens--Nickerson apparatus. The concentrated extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. Volatiles were identified and classified according to their origin, that is, lipid, sugar degradation and/or Maillard reaction not involving sulfur amino acids, sulfur compounds, methoxypyrazines, and other compounds. Quantitative and qualitative differences were observed between isolates from flesh and skins and among cultivars grown at different sites. Strongest isolates from skin were obtained for Nadine. For flesh, Cara gave isolates approximately 10-fold more concentrated than the other three cultivars. For skin, sugar degradation and/or the Maillard reaction was by far the most important source in all cultivars except Nadine, for which 62% of the volatiles were accounted for by the sesquiterpene solavetivone.

A constitutive level of PLPI proteins was found in pepper leaves, and these levels increased up to 2.6-fold upon wounding of the lower leaves. Exposing intact plants to methyl jasmonate vapors induced the accumulation of PLPIs. Supplying excised young pepper plants with water through the cut stems induced PLPI proteins to levels higher than those found in intact plants, but with high variability. Supplying the excised plants with systemin did not result in an increase of PLPI levels that were statistically higher than levels found in excised plants. Gel-blot analyses of PLPI induction revealed the presence of two mRNA bands, having slightly different mobilities in agarose gels. Only the low M(r) mRNA is present in untreated control plants, and it appears to be responsible for the constitutive levels of PLPI found in leaves.

11039318,"As part of an effort to improve the safety of plant foods, a need exists to more clearly delineate the mechanisms of toxicities of glycoalkaloids, which may be present in Solanum plant species such as potatoes, tomatoes and eggplants. Alpha-chaconine is a major glycoalkaloid present in potatoes. To assess the possible influence of structure of pteridine derivatives on toxicity of potato glycoalkaloids, a previous study that demonstrated the protective effects of folic acid against the Solanum glycoalkaloid alpha-chaconine-induced toxicity on Xenopus laevis frog embryo cell membranes was extended to two folate analogues--a synthetic compound widely used as a therapeutic agent methotrexate, and naturally occurring L-monapterin. Adverse effects on embryos were evaluated by observing changes in membrane potentials with an electrochromic dye, di-4-ANEPPS, as a fluorescent probe for the integrity of the membranes. Methotrexate decreased alpha-chaconine-induced polarization, as did folic acid. This decrease may result from an alteration of membrane conformations that prevents the binding of the glycoalkaloid to the membrane receptor sites, and/or from effects on folic acid metabolism. In contrast, L-monapterin did not significantly reduce the alpha-chaconine-induced toxicity.

Because glycoalkaloids can be passed to progenies during breeding programs designed to develop improved potatoes, it is of importance to determine the quality of desired characteristics and the composition of glycoalkaloids of new somatic hybrids. The objective of this study was to determine the appearance, size, and shape (morphological characters) as well as the glycoalkaloid content of potato tubers of somatic hybrids between tetraploid Solanum tuberosum cv.

Tuber size and shape in somatic hybrids were in accord with those of cv. Dejima, whereas the tuber skin color resembled that of ATDH-1.

All somatic hybrids, except one clone, contained four glycoalkaloids (alpha-chaconine, alpha-solanine, alpha-tomatine, and demissine) derived from the fusion parents. The lack of alpha-tomatine in the remaining clone may be due to somaclonal variation.

9680711,"A quantitative method to determine fat in olestra-containing savory snack products was validated within the AOAC Peer-Verified Methods Program. The method may be used to demonstrate compliance with the guidelines of the U.S. Nutrition Labeling and Education Act for labeling products as ""fat free"" or ""low fat."" The method can measure total and saturated fat in savory snacks when present at levels of 0.2-10 g total fat and 0.1-3 g saturated fat per 30 g serving. The method is standardized to measure C6-C24 fatty acids. Extraction of olestra-containing savory snack samples with chloroform-methanol (modified AOAC Official Method 983.23) yields a lipid extract containing the total fat and olestra. The extracted lipid is hydrolyzed by lipase, yielding fatty acids and unreacted olestra. The fatty acids are precipitated as calcium soaps. Olestra is extracted from insoluble soaps with hexane and then discarded. The isolated soaps are converted back into fatty acids with hydrochloric acid and extracted with hexane. The isolated fatty acids are converted to methyl esters with boron trifluoride-methanol and quantitated by capillary gas chromatography using internal standard. Test samples were prepared by blending olestra-containing and full-fat (triglyceride) snacks to obtain 6 levels of spiking (0-10 g total fat added/30 g serving) in potato chips, potato crisps, cheese puffs, and nacho cheese-flavored corn chips. Results were linear (r2 > 0.997) between 0 and 10 g fat/30 g serving for each product matrix. Mean recovery was 101 +/- 6% standard deviation (SD) for total fat and 104 +/- 6% SD for saturated fat. Mean recovery by peer laboratory was 88 +/- 5% SD for total fat and 95 +/- 4% SD for saturated fat in potato chips (0-3 g total fat added/30 g serving).

Repeatability relative standard deviations ranged from 3.90 to 7.33% for total fat and from 4.01 to 11.53% for saturated fat.

15739468,"Sweet potato root tissue, when infected with different pathogens, invaded by insects, or irritated by certain chemicals, turns black-brown and produces and accumulates a large amount of furanoterpenoids such as ipomeamarone, ipomeamaronol, ipomeanine and 4-ipomeanol, which are toxic to animals. The furanoterpenoids from sweet potato root tissues infected with Ceratocystis fimbriata were extracted with ether. The extract solution was washed with 5% Na2CO3 and followed with distilled water and dried with dehydrated sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). The resulting ether extract was evaporated and the residue (crude sample) was dissolved in a small volume of chloroform. The determination of furanoterpenoid toxins was made on the plates at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C respectively. The chloroform-soluble fraction was spotted on a silica gel G thin-layer plate and developed using different solvent systems, n-hexane and ethylacetate (4:1, V/V) , benzene and methanol (9:1, V/V) and petroleum ether and ethylacetate (2:1, V/V), until the solvent front migrated 10 cm from the starting spots. After development, Ehrlich's reagent was sprayed on the plate to detect the compounds. In the experiment, pure ipomeamarone and ipomeamaronol were used as standards. Thin-layer chromatograms on silica gel plates showed the furanoterpenoids were resolved effectively. The repeatability of Rf value was good. The resolution was the best in the solvent systems of benzene-methanol and petroleum ether-ethylacetate at 20 degrees C. After spraying Ehrlich's reagent, ipomeamarone (C) appeared as a light pink spot which soon changed to a dark gray, ipomeamaronol (A) as a purple red spot, compound B and D as a purple red and a gray spot respectively. Compound A, B, C and D had Rf values of 0.05, 0.14, 0.55 and 0.64 (n-hexane-ethylacetate), of 0.15, 0.29, 0.61 and 0.71 (petroleum ether-ethylacetate), of 0.40, 0.55, 0.71 and 0.79 (benzene-methanol), respectively.

Each food was evaluated intra-orally in eight volunteers. Oral fluid samples were obtained from each volunteer at 30 min intervals at five different tooth sites using absorbent paper points. The oral fluid samples were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively for carbohydrates and organic acids using high performance liquid chromatography. Data obtained for each food were averaged and subjected to statistical analysis. The quantity of lactic acid produced 30 min after ingestion was found to be in the following order: (highest) raisin > chocolate bar > sugar cube > jelly bean > oreo cookie > potato chip (least). Two hours after food intake the order had changed significantly: potato chip > jelly bean > sugar cube > chocolate bar > oreo cookie > raisin. A direct linear relationship existed between lactic acid production and the presence of glucose. In foods containing cooked starch prolonged clearance occurs via the intermediate metabolites maltotriose, maltose and glucose. Results indicated that the term 'stickiness', when used to label certain foods such as jelly bean and chocolate bar, should be used cautiously.

The method includes preparation of a residue by treatment with thermostable alpha-amylase and amyloglucosidase and then ethanol precipitation of solubilized dietary fiber components while leaving low-molecular weight carbohydrates in solution. After acid hydrolysis of residue, neutral polysaccharide residues are determined as alditol acetates by gas-liquid chromatography, uronic acid residues are determined by colorimetry, and ash-free acid-insoluble residue (Klason lignin) is determined gravimetrically. Total dietary fiber, including enzyme-resistant starch, is calculated as the sum of nonstarch polysaccharide residues and Klason lignin. Nine laboratories completed the study, analyzing in duplicate 8 unknown dried products that included 4 cereal products, green peas, potato fiber, carrots, and apples. Total dietary fiber contents of products tested ranged from 4.6 to 84.3%, with an average RSDR value of 8.4% (range, 4.8-11.1%).

The enzyme from wheat is the first bc1-complex that is reported to contain four core proteins (55.5, 55.0, 51.5 and 51.0 kDa).

This composition differs from the one reported in fungi, mammals and potato. Partial sequence determination of the large subunits suggests that the 55.5- and 55.0-kDa-proteins represent the beta-subunit of the general mitochondrial processing peptidase, and the 51.5- and 51.0-kDa proteins the alpha-subunit of this enzyme.

The isolates of these species were grown on autoclaved wheat grains and examined for toxicity in a rat-feeding test. A total of 8 of 57 F. oxysporum isolates, 3 of 14 F. solani isolates, and 5 of 9 F. sambucinum isolates caused the death of the rats. Of the 16 toxic isolates, 1 isolate of F. oxysporum produced a substantial amount of moniliformin, which could account for its toxicity. None of the other 15 isolates produced trichothecenes, moniliformin, fusarochromanone, fumonisin B1, or wortmannin. F. sambucinum PZF-4 produced an unknown toxin in wheat culture. This new toxin, given the trivial name sambutoxin, caused toxic effects in rats, including body weight loss, feed refusal, hemorrhage in the stomach and intestines, and, finally, death when rats were fed diets supplemented with 0.05 and 0.1% sambutoxin.

Volatile compounds from corn leaves were isolated using Tenax and identified by capillary gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry. Twenty-one compounds including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, esters, and sesquiterpenes were present in corn. These were separated into fractions by column chromatography on Florisil. Wind-tunnel bioassays of the fractions indicated thatM. grandii was attracted to fractions containing nonpolar and slightly polar compounds including sesquiterpenes, aldehydes, a ketone, and esters. More polar compounds in corn, like alcohols, were not attractive. Attraction to potato odor was based on the presence of the same classes of compounds that were attractive in corn, but more polar compounds were involved in attraction to snap bean odor.

7082284,"1. Methylation analysis of potato (Solanum tuberosum) lectin and thorn-apple (Datura stramonium) lectin confirmed previous conclusions that both glycoproteins contained high proportions of l-arabinofuranosides and lesser amounts of d-galactopyranosides. The arabinofuranosides are present in both lectins as short unbranched chains containing 1-->2- and 1-->3-linkages, which are known to be linked to hydroxyproline. Galactopyranosides are present as monosaccharides, which are known to be attached to serine, in potato lectin and as both the monosaccharide and the 1-->3-linked disaccharide in Datura lectin. 2. Alkaline digestion of potato lectin and subsequent separation of the components by gel filtration led to the isolation of four fractions corresponding to the mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-arabinosides of hydroxyproline. The latter two fractions accounted for over 70% of the total hydroxyproline. 3. Methylation analysis was used to show that the triarabinoside contained only 1-->2-linkages between sugars, but that the tetra-arabinoside contained both 1-->2- and 1-->3-linkages. Direct-insertion mass spectrometry of these compounds using electron impact and chemical ionization, in a comparison with other known structural patterns, was used to determine the sequences of the sugars, which were Araf1-->2Araf1-->2Araf1-->Hyp and Araf1-->3Araf1-->2Araf1-->2Araf 1-->Hyp. 4. On the basis of optical rotation it had previously been suggested [Allen, Desai, Neuberger & Creeth (1978) Biochem. J.171, 665-674] that all the arabinose of potato lectin was present as the beta-l-furanoside. However, measurement of the optical rotations of the hydroxyprolyl arabinosides showed that whereas the diarabinoside had a molar rotation ([m]) value close to that predicted, the triarabinoside was more dextrorotatory and the tetra-arabinoside was less dextrorotatory than expected. Possible explanations for these findings are that, although the di- and tri-arabinosides contain exclusively beta-arabinofuranosides, in the tri-arabinoside, interactions between pentose units lead to an enhanced positive rotation. The tetra-arabinoside, however, is proposed to contain a single alpha-arabinofuranoside residue, which is responsible for the lower than expected positive rotation. The observed rotation of the tetra-arabinoside was found to be close to the theoretical value predicted on that basis. Furthermore, the action of a specific alpha-arabinofuranosidase on the tetrasaccharide was to remove a single arabinose residue, presumably the terminal non-reducing sugar, and to produce a product that was indistinguishable on electrophoresis from the triarabinoside. Changes in rotation were compatible with this assumption. 5. It is concluded that the structures of the hydroxyprolyl tri- and tetra-arabinosides of potato lectin are: betaAraf1-->2betaAraf1-->2betaAraf1-->Hyp and alphaAraf1-->3betaAraf1-->2betaAraf 1-->2betaAraf1-->Hyp.

235999,"A procedure is presented for the rapid purification of a 5'-nucleotidase (5'-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.5) from potato tubers, involving ammonium sulphate fractionation and chromatography on phosphocellulose, DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-75. Application of this procedure results in a 6000-fold purification of the 5'-nucleotidase and the final preparations are virtually homogeneous, yielding only one protein band on electrophorsis in polyacrylamide gels in non-dissociating or dissociating conditions. The 5'-nucleotidase has a molecular weight of 50 000 from gel filtration experiments. Sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified 5'-nucleotidase reveals one major band of molecular weight 25 000. The 5'-nucleotidase is competitively inhibited by cyclic nucleotides, having micromolar Ki values for cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP at pH 5.0 and pH 8.0. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 5.0 with 5'-GMP as substrate. While 5'-AMP and 3'-AMP are hydrolyzed at comparable rates at pH 5.0, at pH 8.0 the rate of hydrolysis of 3'-AMP is only 4% of that with 5'-AMP. ADP, ATP and 2'-AMP are very poor substrates for the enzyme. The nucleotidase has micromolar Km values for nucleoside 5'-monophosphates other than 5'-NMP. A wide variety of divalent cations activate the 5'-nucleotidase.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,"['D002104', 'D002413', 'D002850', 'D002852', 'D000242', 'D006152', 'D004355', 'D004591', 'D004789', 'D005459', 'D006863', 'D007700', 'D007854', 'D008970', 'D009708', 'D010944', 'D013997']","['Cadmium', 'Cations, Divalent', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Drug Stability', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fluorides', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleotidases', 'Plants', 'Time Factors']",Purification and characterization of a cyclic nucleotide-regulated 5'-nucleotidase from potatoe.,"['Q000494', None, None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000201', None]","['pharmacology', None, None, None, 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', None, None, 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', None, None, 'pharmacology', None, 'isolation & purification', 'enzymology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/235999,1975
