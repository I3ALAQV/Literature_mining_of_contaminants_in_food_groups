35080159,"Disulfoton, an organophosphorus pesticide, is used to control cotton, beet, potato, and other seedling period aphids, leaf moths, underground pests, etc., with internal absorption, killing, gastric poisoning, and fumigation. Disulfoton is a highly toxic organophosphate pesticide, which can inhibit cholinesterase activity, resulting in neurophysiological disorders by inhalation, feeding, and transdermal absorption. Disulfoton is difficult to degrade in the environment, which leads to enrichment in organisms and interference with endocrine. This compound is harmful to the ecological environment and human health. To ensure the quality and safety of food, it is important to develop a detection method for disulfoton and its metabolites in agricultural products. A reliable method based on dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) with ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was developed for the determination of disulfoton and its metabolites (disulfoton sulfone, disulfoton sulfoxide, demeton-",Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,"['D002851', 'D004222', 'D006801', 'D037742', 'D009943', 'D010575', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Disulfoton', 'Humans', 'Nanotubes, Carbon', 'Organophosphorus Compounds', 'Pesticides', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",[Determination of disulfoton and its metabolites in agricultural products by dispersive soild phase extraction-ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry].,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35080159,2022

34884943,"Chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) is a phenolic compound from the hydroxycinnamic acid family. Epidemiological, biological, and biochemical studies concur to support the beneficial role of chlorogenic acid in human health, along with other dietary phenolic compounds. Thus, chlorogenic acid has been reported to exert inhibitory effects on carcinogenesis in the large intestine, liver, and tongue, and a protective action on oxidative stress in vivo, together with anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and antihypertensive activities. It is also claimed to have antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral effects with relatively low toxicity and side effects, alongside properties that do not lead to antimicrobial resistance. Due to its importance, numerous methods for determining chlorogenic acid (CGA), as well as for its derivatives from coffee beans and other plants, were elaborated. The most frequently used methods are infrared spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), capillary electrophoresis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and chemiluminescence. Although these methods proved to be efficient for quantifying CGA and its derived products, a number of deficiencies were identified: they are time consuming, laborious, and require expensive instruments. Therefore, electrochemical methods have been developed and used in the determination of CGA in different nutraceuticals or food products. The present review aims to present the main progresses and performance characteristics of electrochemical sensors and biosensors used to detect CGA, as it is reported in a high number of relevant scientific papers published mainly in the last decade.",International journal of molecular sciences,"['D015374', 'D002726', 'D040503', 'D055664', 'D006801', 'D010936', 'D010944']","['Biosensing Techniques', 'Chlorogenic Acid', 'Coffea', 'Electrochemical Techniques', 'Humans', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plants']",A Review on Electrochemical Sensors and Biosensors Used in Chlorogenic Acid Electroanalysis.,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34884943,2021
34792196,"Food processing can alter protein structure, modulate enzyme accessibility, and therefore the release of bioactive peptides. Thus, processing techniques, boiling, high-pressure processing (HPP), and a combination of both, were compared for their efficiency to release antioxidant peptides after alcalase hydrolysis of Great Northern Beans (GNBs). The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) indicated that boiled hydrolysates had the highest antioxidant activity (370.9 ± 43.8 µmol TEAC/g). Mass spectrometry-based analysis suggested that di- and tri-peptide expression were significantly altered among the three treatments, and either Ile, Leu, Phe, and Arg containing peptides potentially contributed toward the enhanced antioxidant activity. Furthermore, the total phenolic content of the HPP-treated hydrolysate was higher than the other two treatments, with ferulic acid being the most prominent phenolic compound present in the bean hydrolysates. This study indicates that thermal processing such as boiling is more effective in modulating the release of antioxidant peptides. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), such as Great Northern Beans (GNBs) are one of the major pulse crops in the United States. Storage proteins in beans can release peptides with biological activities after enzymatic hydrolysis. However, processing conditions can modulate the release of peptides. The present study is primarily focused on comparing the two processing methods, boiling and HPP, and their combination for the generation of peptides with potential antioxidant activity in alcalase-digested GNBs. Data from the study suggest that thermal treatment such as boiling is more effective in modulating the release of peptides from alcalase hydrolysate of GNBs with antioxidant activity. This is particularly important because over different cultures around the world, boiling is the most widely used processing method for the cooking of beans, and hence, these data also ensure that boiling is the most effective method in getting the most beneficial effects from the consumption of beans.",Journal of food biochemistry,"['D000975', 'D027805', 'D010636', 'D011492', 'D013381']","['Antioxidants', 'Phaseolus', 'Phenols', 'Protein Hydrolysates', 'Subtilisins']",Evaluating the effect of high-pressure processing in contrast to boiling on the antioxidant activity from alcalase hydrolysate of Great Northern Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris).,"['Q000494', None, None, None, None]","['pharmacology', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34792196,2022

34201792,"Pulse crop seed coats are a sustainable source of antioxidant polyphenols, but are typically treated as low-value products, partly because some polyphenols reduce iron bioavailability in humans. This study correlates antioxidant/iron chelation capabilities of diverse seed coat types from five major pulse crops (common bean, lentil, pea, chickpea and faba bean) with polyphenol composition using mass spectrometry. Untargeted metabolomics was used to identify key differences and a hierarchical analysis revealed that common beans had the most diverse polyphenol profiles among these pulse crops. The highest antioxidant capacities were found in seed coats of black bean and all tannin lentils, followed by maple pea, however, tannin lentils showed much lower iron chelation among these seed coats. Thus, tannin lentils are more desirable sources as natural antioxidants in food applications, whereas black bean and maple pea are more suitable sources for industrial applications. Regardless of pulse crop, proanthocyanidins were primary contributors to antioxidant capacity, and to a lesser extent, anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols, whereas glycosylated flavonols contributed minimally.

34199752,"Coffee has been studied for its health benefits, including prevention of several chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, Parkinson's, and liver diseases. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), an important component in coffee beans, was shown to possess antiviral activity against viruses. However, the presence of caffeine in coffee beans may also cause insomnia and stomach irritation, and increase heart rate and respiration rate. These unwanted effects may be reduced by decaffeination of green bean Arabica coffee (GBAC) by treatment with dichloromethane, followed by solid-phase extraction using methanol. In this study, the caffeine and chlorogenic acid (CGA) level in the coffee bean from three different areas in West Java, before and after decaffeination, was determined and validated using HPLC. The results showed that the levels of caffeine were reduced significantly, with an order as follows: Tasikmalaya (2.28% to 0.097% (97 ppm), Pangalengan (1.57% to 0.049% (495 ppm), and Garut (1.45% to 0.00002% (0.2 ppm).

Few studies have currently assessed the effects of female Zn level on the outcome of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). This study investigated the association between serum Zn concentration and IVF-ET outcomes, and the potential effects of some lifestyles on this association. A prospective cohort study design was adopted, and 305 women undergoing IVF-ET were recruited from two cities, Beijing and Shandong, in northern China. Fasting blood specimens were obtained on the day prior to the first treatment cycle. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic characteristics and lifestyle information. Serum Zn concentration was measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Female serum Zn levels in Beijing center were found to be significantly higher than those in Shandong center. Women who failed to achieve clinical pregnancy had significantly lower Zn concentrations among Shandong subjects, but not in Beijing or the total participants in both centers. For Beijing participants, no statistically significant associations were found between Zn concentrations and the failure risk of IVF-ET [adjusted relative risk (aRR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37-1.15]. For Shandong participants, lower Zn concentrations (< 610.3 ng/mL) were associated with a 66% increased risk of IVF-ET failure (aRR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.10-2.51). Also, significantly positive correlations were observed between Zn concentrations and the habitual consumption of two food types, including fresh vegetables and beans or bean products, but this was not the case in Beijing. It was concluded that the effect of serum Zn concentrations on IVF-ET outcome may vary by the geographic location.

PCs from six beans were purified (purity > 98.2%) by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and subsequently identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-Quadrupole (Q)-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-HRMS). Results showed that the PC content of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and soybean (Glycine max) was 50.0 and 34.0 mg/g, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of other beans (P < 0.05). Gas chromatographic analysis showed that soybean contained high proportion of PUFA (58.78%), and chickpea contained high proportion of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (2.73%). A total of 49 molecular species were identified by UHPLC-Q-HRMS. (18:2-18:2)PC was predominant in soybean, adzuki bean, runner bean, and common bean. (16:0-18:1)PC was the major species of chickpea PC, and many ether PC species and DHA-PC were identified. Discriminatory analysis by principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the molecular profiles of chickpea PC were significantly different from other beans studied. The findings suggest that chickpea appears to be an interesting plant source of DHA and ether lipids for dietary supplement. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, we reported an UHPLC-Q-HRMS technique to identify PC molecular species of six beans. The diversity of PC molecular species in the different beans was classified using chemometrics. This analytical method not only provides comprehensive information to nutritionists about the PC distribution in different beans, but also can identify biomarkers for bean flour fraud identification in food supplementation. Furthermore, the approach gives fragmentation patterns of several PC species and could be further applied to determine the chemical structure of PC molecular species from many natural resources.",Journal of food science,"['D002851', 'D002855', 'D007887', 'D005231', 'D013058', 'D010713', 'D010936']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Fabaceae', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Plant Extracts']",Exploration of natural phosphatidylcholine sources from six beans by UHPLC-Q-HRMS.,"['Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['methods', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32856304,2020

31882114,"A large fraction of the South-American cacao production is affected by new cadmium (Cd) regulations in cacao. This work was set up to characterize the distribution and speciation of Cd within the cacao fruit and to monitor potential Cd redistribution during cacao fermentation. In cacao fruits from four locations, Cd concentrations decreased with testa > nib ~ placenta ~ pod husk > mucilage. The distribution of Cd within cacao beans was successfully visualized using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and confirmed higher Cd concentrations in the testa than in the nib. Speciation analysis by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) of unfermented cacao beans revealed that Cd was bound to O/N-ligands in both nib and testa. Fermentation induced an outward Cd migration from the nibs to the testa, i.e. against the total concentration gradient. This migration occurred only if the fermentation was sufficiently extensive to decrease the pH in the nib to <5.0, likely as a result of increased Cd mobility due to organic acid penetration into the nibs. The change in dry weight based nib Cd concentrations during fermentation was, on average, a factor 1.3 decrease. We propose that nib Cd can be reduced if the nib pH is sufficiently acidified during fermentation. However, a balance must be found between flavor development and Cd removal since extreme acidity is detrimental for cacao flavor.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D002099', 'D002104', 'D005285', 'D006863', 'D012639', 'D013696']","['Cacao', 'Cadmium', 'Fermentation', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Seeds', 'Temperature']",The impact of fermentation on the distribution of cadmium in cacao beans.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31882114,2021

This study aimed to characterise and classify CBSs obtained from cocoa beans of diverse cultivars and collected in different geographical origins through their volatile profile assessed using headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-qMS) and E-nose combined with principal component analysis (PCA). The study provides, for the first time in a representative set of samples, a comprehensive fingerprint and semi-quantitative data for >100 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as aldehydes, ketones, pyrazines, alcohols, and acids. Through PCA, a clear separation of the Criollo cultivar from the other cultivars was achieved with both GC-qMS and E-nose analytical techniques because of the high content of key-aroma VOCs. Several biomarkers identified by GC-qMS, such as 2-hepanol, 2-methylpropanoic acid, and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, recognized as key-aroma compounds for cocoa beans, were found suitable for the classification of CBSs according to their quality and origin. GC-qMS and E-nose appeared to be suitable analytical approaches to classify CBSs, with a high correlation between both analytical techniques. The volatile fingerprint and classification of CBSs could allow for the selection of samples with a specific flavour profile according to the food application and, therefore, constitute an interesting approach to valorise this by-product as a food ingredient.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000438', 'D000447', 'D002099', 'D062609', 'D005504', 'D008401', 'D007659', 'D009812', 'D010936', 'D025341', 'D011719', 'D052617', 'D013649', 'D055549']","['Alcohols', 'Aldehydes', 'Cacao', 'Electronic Nose', 'Food Analysis', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Ketones', 'Odorants', 'Plant Extracts', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Pyrazines', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Taste', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Assessment of volatile fingerprint by HS-SPME/GC-qMS and E-nose for the classification of cocoa bean shells using chemometrics.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285018,2020

Contamination level for 19 PAHs, 15 of which were heavy PAHs included on the list of European Union Scientific Committee in Food, varied from 4.29 to 16.17 µg/kg in roasted coffee beans, whereas in green coffee beans varied from 8.66 to 76.63 µg/kg. The results of statistical analysis showed that the contamination level in roasted coffee beans was significantly lower than that in green beans. The applied parameters of roasting did not lead to the occurrence of conditions in which PAHs, especially heavy ones, would possibly be formed. On the contrary, the roasting process itself had significantly reduced the PAHs content in the final product.

The presence of pesticides such as CPF in edible vegetables has been already reported, but little is known about the effects induced by this pesticide stress on the morphology, oxidative response and lipid composition of treated plants. In this work, green bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) were exposed to increasing concentrations of CPF and the different plant parts (roots, stem bases, stem, leaves, pods and beans) were subjected to different analyses. First, morphometric parameters and the oxidative response caused by CPF were explored. In a second phase of the study, an untargeted lipidomic analysis of the different tissue extracts was performed and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry images of pods and beans were recorded and analysed to illustrate the spatial distribution of the changes observed. As a result of CPF treatment, plants showed a significant decrease in their height, leaf length, and pod number. The biochemical analysis showed lipid peroxidation and the activation of antioxidant mechanisms in roots, stem and leaves. Regarding the lipidomic results, changes in lipid levels were observed, mainly in leaves, pods and seeds. The main changes observed were a reduction of photosynthetic pigments and lipids in leaves and a decrease of triacylglycerols levels in pods and seeds. This last point was confirmed by the analysis of mass spectrometry images of the pods. These observations suggest that CPF would affect the yield of green bean crops as well as the nutritional value of pods and beans.

29280563,"Cocoa seed storage proteins play an important role in flavour development as aroma precursors are formed from their degradation during fermentation. Major proteins in the beans of Theobroma cacao are the storage proteins belonging to the vicilin and albumin classes. Although both these classes of proteins have been extensively characterized, there is still limited information on the expression and abundance of other proteins present in cocoa beans. This work is the first attempt to characterize the whole cocoa bean proteome by nano-UHPLC-ESI MS/MS analysis using tryptic digests of cocoa bean protein extracts. The results of this analysis show that >1000 proteins could be identified using a species-specific Theobroma cacao database. The majority of the identified proteins were involved with metabolism and energy. Additionally, a significant number of the identified proteins were linked to protein synthesis and processing. Several proteins were also involved with plant response to stress conditions and defence. Albumin and vicilin storage proteins showed the highest intensity values among all detected proteins, although only seven entries were identified as storage proteins. A comparison of MS/MS data searches carried out against larger non-specific databases confirmed that using a species-specific database can increase the number of identified proteins, and at the same time reduce the number of false positives.

The occurrence of mycotoxins (aflatoxins, ochratoxins, zearalenone, and fumonisins) in feed samples affects the animal's health and also serves as a secondary contamination to humans via consumption of eggs, milk and meats. Of these, aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) is the most toxically potent and a confirmed carcinogen to both humans and animals. Methods such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are common in the determination of mycotoxins. However, these methods usually require sample pre-treatment, extensive cleanup and skilled operator. Therefore, in the present work, a rapid method of electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of AFB₁ was developed based on an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

We measured CAF and KAH concentrations in leaves, roots, flower buds, flowers and fruit tissues at seven developmental stages (30-240 days after flowering - DAF) using HPLC. Higher CAF levels were detected in flower buds and flowers when compared to fruits. In contrast, KAH concentration increased along fruit development, peaking at 120 DAF. We did not detect CAF or KAH in leaves, and higher amounts of KAH than CAF were detected in roots. Using P450 candidate genes from a coffee EST database, we performed RT-qPCR transcriptional analysis of leaves, flowers and fruits at three developmental stages (90, 120 and 150 DAF). Three P450 genes (CaCYP76C4, CaCYP82C2 and CaCYP74A1) had transcriptional patterns similar to CAF concentration and two P450 genes (CaCYP71A25 and CaCYP701A3) have transcript accumulation similar to KAH concentration. These data warrant further investigation of these P450s as potential candidate genes involved in the final stages of the CAF and KAH biosynthetic pathways.",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,"['D002851', 'D040503', 'D003577', 'D004224', 'D035264', 'D005638', 'D018506', 'D017343', 'D056726', 'D018515', 'D010940', 'D018517', 'D014158']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coffea', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Diterpenes', 'Flowers', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Transcription, Genetic']","Diterpenes biochemical profile and transcriptional analysis of cytochrome P450s genes in leaves, roots, flowers, and during Coffea arabica L. fruit development.","[None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000032', 'Q000201', 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000201', 'Q000235', 'Q000201', None]","[None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'analysis', 'enzymology', 'genetics', None, None, None, 'enzymology', 'genetics', 'enzymology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28002787,2017

The NiPc compound, when excited at 350 nm, decreases of emission with increases of the iron(III) concentration at 425 nm were used analytical response in a modified standard addition method. The method was validated by analyzing two certified reference materials (CRM-SA-C Sandy Soil C and Mixed Polish Herbs (INCT-MPH-2). Food and drug samples were digested in a closed microwave system using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, all iron in the samples converted to iron(III) ion.

27155370,"Fava beans are eaten all over the world and recently, marketing for their sprouts began in Japan. Fava bean sprouts contain more polyphenols and l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) than the bean itself. Our antioxidant screening program has shown that fava bean sprouts also possess a higher antioxidant activity than other commercially available sprouts and mature beans. However, the individual constituents of fava bean sprouts are not entirely known. In the present study, we investigated the phenolic compounds of fava bean sprouts and their antioxidant activity. Air-dried fava bean sprouts were treated with 80% methanol and the extract was partitioned in water with chloroform and ethyl acetate. HPLC analysis had shown that the ethyl acetate-soluble parts contained phenolic compounds, separated by preparative HPLC to yield 5 compounds (1-5). Structural analysis using NMR and MS revealed that the compounds isolated were kaempferol glycosides. All isolated compounds had an α-rhamnose at the C-7 position with different sugars attached at the C-3 position. Compounds 1-5 had β-galactose, β-glucose, α-rhamnose, 6-acetyl-β-galactose and 6-acetyl-β-glucose, respectively, at the C-3 position. The amount of l-DOPA in fava bean sprouts was determined by the quantitative (1) H NMR technique. The l-DOPA content was 550.45 mg ± 11.34 /100 g of the raw sprouts. The antioxidant activities of compounds 2-5 and l-DOPA were evaluated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay. l-DOPA showed high antioxidant activity, but the isolated kaempferol glycosides showed weak activity. Therefore, it can be suggested that l-DOPA contributed to the antioxidant activity of fava bean sprouts.

N-methylpipecolic acid was found at similar levels in green coffee beans of Robusta and Arabica, whereas a noticeable difference of homostachydrine content was observed between the two green coffee bean species. Interestingly, homostachydrine content was found to be unaffected by coffee bean roasting treatment because of a noticeable heat stability, a feature that makes this compound a candidate marker to determine the content of Robusta and Arabica species in roasted coffee blends. To this end, a number of certified pure Arabica and Robusta green beans were analyzed for their homostachydrine content. Results showed that homostachydrine content was 1.5±0.5mg/kg in Arabica beans and 31.0±10.0mg/kg in Robusta beans.

They possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, however they may induce symptoms and health problems in a small percentage of the population. Therefore, a low phenolic acid diet may be of clinical benefit to such individuals. In order to achieve this goal, the concentration of these substances in different food and beverages should be assessed. The present work describes for the first time a new method, based on solid phase microextraction (polydimethylsiloxane-divinylbenzene fiber) coupled to liquid chromatography with UV diode array detection, for the simultaneous determination of salicylic acid, 3-methyl salicylic acid, 4-methyl salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid and benzoic acid in selected fruit, vegetables and beverages. All the aspects influencing fiber adsorption (time, temperature, pH, salt addition) and desorption (desorption and injection time, desorption solvent mixture composition) of the analytes have been investigated.

The overall levels of BPA in the composite food samples from each of the five years from 2008 to 2012 were similar in general with averages (range) of 7.7 ng/g (0.20-106 ng/g), 7.8 ng/g (0.26-110 ng/g), 6.9 ng/g (0.20-84 ng/g), 7.7 ng/g (0.20-105 ng/g) and 9.0 ng/g (0.15-90 ng/g) for 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Levels of BPA in most of the non-canned food composite samples were low and no particular trends were observed. In contrast, the trend of BPA levels in canned food composite samples over the five years (2008-2012) varies. BPA levels in most of the canned food composite samples from 2008 to 2012 were consistent in general (e.g. canned luncheon meat: 10-18 ng/g, canned baked beans: 18-25 ng/g). While BPA levels over the five years were found to decrease for some canned food composite samples (e.g., canned fish: 109 ng/g in 2009 vs. 51 ng/g in 2012), they were also found to increase for some other canned food composite samples (e.g. canned meat soups: 90-104 ng/g in 2011-2012 vs. 29 ng/g in 2008). Thus, recent changes in can coating for food packaging to BPA-free alternatives may have not been fully reflected in all canned food products over the period from 2008 to 2012.

The major staple diet in South Asia, rice, was chosen to study its interaction with UO2(2+), the active uranium species in water, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Highest uptake limit was checked by cooking rice at very high uranium concentration and it was found to be good scavenger of uranium. To gain insight into the mechanism of uptake, direct interaction of UO2(2+) with monosaccharides was also studied, using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry taking mannose as a model. The studies have been done with dissolved uranium salt, uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UO2(NO3)2·6H2O), as well as the leachate of a stable oxide of uranium, UO2(s), both of which exist as UO2(2+) in water. Among the eight different rice varieties investigated, Karnataka Ponni showed the maximum uranium uptake whereas unpolished Basmati rice showed the minimum. Interaction with other foodstuffs (potato, carrot, peas, kidney beans and lentils) with and without NaCl affected the extent of chemical interaction but was not consistent with the carbohydrate content. Uranium interaction with D-mannose monitored through ESI-MS, under optimized instrumental parameters, identified the peaks corresponding to uranyl adduct with mannose monomer, dimer and trimer and the species were confirmed by MS/MS studies.

25951406,"Outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections are most frequently associated with the consumption of contaminated oysters. A rapid and selective concentration method is necessary for the recovery of HAV from contaminated oysters prior to detection using PCR. In this study, ricin extracted from castor beans (Ricinus communis) was tested as an alternative to antibody used in immunomagnetic separation while concentrating HAV prior to its detection using reverse transcription PCR. Initially, the extracted proteins from castor beans were fractionated into 13 fractions by gel filtration chromatography. Pretreatment of different protein fractions showed a variation in binding of HAV viral protein (VP) 1 to oyster digestive tissue in the range of 25.9 to 63.9%. The protein fraction, which caused the highest reduction in binding of VP1 to the tissue, was identified as ricin A by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Ricin A could significantly inhibit binding of VP1 to the tissue with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 4.5 μg/ml and a maximal inhibitory concentration of 105.2%. The result showed that the rate of inhibition of HAV binding to tissue was higher compared to the rate of ricin itself binding to HAV (slope: 0.0029 versus 0.00059). However, ricin A concentration showed a higher correlation to the relative binding of ricin itself to HAV than the inhibition of binding of HAV to the tissue (coefficient of determination, R(2): 0.9739 versus 0.6804). In conclusion, ricin A-linked magnetic bead separation combined with reverse transcription PCR can successfully detect HAV in artificially seeded oyster digestive tissue up to a 10(-4) dilution of the virus stock (titer: 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective dose per ml).

25802220,"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in identifying and characterizing the yeast flora associated with diverse types of habitat because of the many potential desirable technological properties of these microorganisms, especially in food applications. In this study, a total of 101 yeast strains were isolated from the skins of tropical fruits collected in several locations in the South West Indian Ocean. Sequence analysis of the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA gene identified 26 different species. Among them, two species isolated from the skins of Cape gooseberry and cocoa beans appeared to represent putative new yeast species, as their LSU D1/D2 sequence was only 97.1% and 97.4% identical to that of the yeasts Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Candida pararugosa, respectively. A total of 52 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) were detected by Head Space Solid Phase Micro Extraction coupled to Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectroscopy (HS-SPME-GC/MS) from the 26 yeast species cultivated on a glucose rich medium. Among these VOCs, 6 uncommon compounds were identified, namely ethyl but-2-enoate, ethyl 2-methylbut-2-enoate (ethyl tiglate), ethyl 3-methylbut-2-enoate, 2-methylpropyl 2-methylbut-2-enoate, butyl 2-methylbut-2-enoate and 3-methylbutyl 2-methylbut-2-enoate, making them possible yeast species-specific markers. In addition, statistical methods such as Principal Component Analysis allowed to associate each yeast species with a specific flavor profile.

25766479,"A new multi-component analysis method based on zero-crossing point-continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) was developed for simultaneous spectrophotometric determination of Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) ions based on the complex formation with 2-benzyl espiro[isoindoline-1,5 oxasolidine]-2,3,4 trione (BSIIOT). The absorption spectra were evaluated with respect to synthetic ligand concentration, time of complexation and pH. Therefore according the absorbance values, 0.015 mmol L(-1) BSIIOT, 10 min after mixing and pH 8.0 were used as optimum values. The complex formation between BSIIOT ligand and the cations Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) by application of rank annihilation factor analysis (RAFA) were investigated. Daubechies-4 (db4), discrete Meyer (dmey), Morlet (morl) and Symlet-8 (sym8) continuous wavelet transforms for signal treatments were found to be suitable among the wavelet families. The applicability of new synthetic ligand and selected mother wavelets were used for the simultaneous determination of strongly overlapped spectra of species without using any pre-chemical treatment. Therefore, CWT signals together with zero crossing technique were directly applied to the overlapping absorption spectra of Cu(2+) and Pb(2+). The calibration graphs for estimation of Pb(2+) and Cu (2+)were obtained by measuring the CWT amplitudes at zero crossing points for Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) at the wavelet domain, respectively. The proposed method was validated by simultaneous determination of Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) ions in red beans, walnut, rice, tea and soil samples. The obtained results of samples with proposed method have been compared with those predicted by partial least squares (PLS) and flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS).","Spectrochimica acta.

A method for the simultaneous determination of the four mycotoxins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was validated by a small-scale interlaboratory study using two spiked wheat samples (DON was spiked at 20 and 100 μg/kg and ZEN, T-2, and HT-2 at 6 and 20 μg/kg in the respective samples). The recovery of the four mycotoxins ranged from 77.3 to 107.2%. A total of 557 samples of 10 different commodities were analyzed over 3 years by this validated method. Both T-2 and HT-2 were detected in wheat, wheat flour, barley, Job's tears products, beer, corn grits, azuki beans, soybeans, and rice with mixed grains. Only T-2 toxin was detected in sesame seeds. The highest concentrations of T-2 toxin (48.4 μg/kg) and HT-2 toxin (85.0 μg/kg) were present in azuki beans and wheat, respectively. DON was frequently detected in wheat, wheat flour, beer, and corn grits. The contamination level of wheat was below the provisional standard in Japan (1,100 μg/kg).

Due to its nutritional quality and taste, it has gained a high monetary value. Thus, it is prone to adulteration with other yellow split peas. In order to discriminate ""Fava Santorinis"" from other yellow split peas, four classification methods utilising rare earth elements (REEs) measured through inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are studied. The four classification processes are orthogonal projection analysis (OPA), Mahalanobis distance (MD), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and k nearest neighbours (KNN). Since it is known that trace elements are often useful to determine geographical origin of food products, we further quantitated for trace elements using ICP-MS. Presented in this paper are results using the four classification processes based on the fusion of the REEs data with the trace element data. Overall, the OPA method was found to perform best with up to 100% accuracy using the fused data.

Larvae of the beetle cannot grow on roasted coffee beans or dried black or green tea leaves, although they oviposit on such products. We investigated oviposition by the beetles on MeOH extracts of the above products. The number of eggs laid increased with an increase in dose of each extract, indicating that chemical factors stimulate oviposition by the beetles. This was especially true for \ coffee bean extracts, which elicited high numbers of eggs even at a low dose (0.1 g bean equivalent/ml) compared to other extracts. Coffee beans were extracted in hexane, chloroform, 1-butanol, MeOH, and 20% MeOH in water. The number of eggs laid was higher on filter papers treated with chloroform, 1-butanol, MeOH, and 20% MeOH in water extracts than on control (solvent alone) papers.

High performance liquid chromatography-post column derivatisation revealed the generation of new phenolic compounds as a result of roasting. Antioxidant mechanism of bean less-polar phenolic compounds was largely based on free radical scavenging activity. The bean phenolic compounds with reducing capability were heat stable. Roasted faba bean extracts (70% acetone, v/v) were fractionated into relatively polar and non-polar fractions; the latter contributed the majority of the antioxidant capacity. The extracts from beans with different seed coat colours differed in their phenolic compositions, which suggest different levels of potential benefits to health. Although roasting initially lowers the bean antioxidant capacity, prolonged roasting at 150 °C for 60 min and longer causes generation of new phenolic compounds and an increased antioxidant capacity.

A linear correlation was found between the level of several trace elements in chocolate and the cocoa solids content. Significant levels of Bi and As were found in the cocoa bean shells but not in the cocoa bean and chocolate. This may be attributed to environmental contamination. The presence of other elements was attributed to the manufacturing processes of cocoa and chocolate products.

24390407,"While metabolomics is increasingly used to investigate the food metabolome and identify new markers of food exposure, limited attention has been given to the validation of such markers. The main objectives of the present study were to (1) discover potential food exposure markers (PEMs) for a range of plant foods in a study setting with a mixed dietary background and (2) validate PEMs found in a previous meal study. Three-day weighed dietary records and 24-h urine samples were collected three times during a 6-month parallel intervention study from 107 subjects randomized to two distinct dietary patterns. An untargeted UPLC-qTOF-MS metabolomics analysis was performed on the urine samples, and all features detected underwent strict data analyses, including an iterative paired t test and sensitivity and specificity analyses for foods. A total of 22 unique PEMs were identified that covered 7 out of 40 investigated food groups (strawberry, cabbages, beetroot, walnut, citrus, green beans and chocolate). The PEMs reflected foods with a distinct composition rather than foods eaten more frequently or in larger amounts. We found that 23 % of the PEMs found in a previous meal study were also valid in the present intervention study. The study demonstrates that it is possible to discover and validate PEMs for several foods and food classes in an intervention study with a mixed dietary background, despite the large variability in such a dataset.

On the one hand, REMPI-TOFMS was applied to monitor roasting gases of an industrial roaster (1500 kg/h capacity), with the aim of determining the roast degree in real-time from the transient chemical signature of VOCs. On the other hand, a previously developed μ-probe sampling device was used to analyse roasting gases from individual coffee beans. The aim was to explore fundamental processes at the individual bean level and link these to phenomena at the batch level. The pioneering single-bean experiments were conducted in two configurations: (1) VOCs formed inside a bean were sampled in situ, i.e. via a drilled μ-hole, from the interior, using a μ-probe (inside). (2) VOCs were sampled on-line in close vicinity of a single coffee bean's surface (outside). The focus was on VOCs originating from hydrolysis and pyrolytic degradation of chlorogenic acids, like feruloyl quinic acid and caffeoyl quinic acid. The single bean experiments revealed interesting phenomena. First, differences in time-intensity profiles between inside versus outside (time shift of maximum) were observed and tentatively linked to the permeability of the bean's cell walls material. Second, sharp bursts of some VOCs were observed, while others did exhibit smooth release curves. It is believed that these reflect a direct observation of bean popping during roasting.

However, the chemical compounds that can be used to discriminate the maturity of the beans remain uncharacterized. We herein analyzed four distinct stages of maturity (immature, semi-mature, mature and overripe) of nine different varieties of green Coffea arabica beans hand-harvested from a single experimental field in Hawaii. After developing a high-throughput experimental system for sample preparation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurement, we applied metabolic profiling, integrated with chemometric techniques, to explore the relationship between the metabolome and maturity of the sample in a non-biased way. For the multivariate statistical analyses, a partial least square (PLS) regression model was successfully created, which allowed us to accurately predict the maturity of the beans based on the metabolomic information. As a result, tryptophan was identified to be the best contributor to the regression model; the relative MS intensity of tryptophan was higher in immature beans than in those after the semi-mature stages in all arabica varieties investigated, demonstrating a universal discrimination factor for diverse arabica beans. Therefore, typtophan, either alone or together with other metabolites, may be utilized for traders as an assessment standard when purchasing qualified trading green arabica bean products.

The technique is applied for the first time in a feasibility study to record the formation of volatile and flavour compounds during the roasting process within (inside) or in the direct vicinity (outside) of individual coffee beans. A real-time on-line analysis of evolving volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOC and SVOC) as they are formed under the mild pyrolytic conditions of the roasting process was performed. The soft-ionisation mass spectra depict a molecular ion signature, which is well corresponding with the existing knowledge of coffee roasting and evolving compounds. Additionally, thereby it is possible to discriminate between Coffea arabica (Arabica) and Coffea canephora (Robusta). The recognized differences in the roasting gas profiles reflect the differences in the precursor composition of the coffee cultivars very well. Furthermore, a well-known set of marker compounds for Arabica and Robusta, namely the lipids kahweol and cafestol (detected in their dehydrated form at m/z 296 and m/z 298, respectively) were observed. If the variation in time of different compounds is observed, distinctly different evolution behaviours were detected. Here, phenol (m/z 94) and caffeine (m/z 194) are exemplary chosen, whereas phenol shows very sharp emission peaks, caffeine do not have this highly transient behaviour. Finally, the changes of the chemical signature as a function of the roasting time, the influence of sampling position (inside, outside) and cultivar (Arabica, Robusta) is investigated by multivariate statistics (PCA).

Starch contributes to the physicochemical attributes of food products made from roots, legumes, cereals, and fruits. It occurs naturally as distinct particles, called granules. Most starch granules are a mixture of 2 sugar polymers: a highly branched polysaccharide named amylopectin and a basically linear polysaccharide named amylose. The starch contained in food products undergoes changes during processing, which causes changes in the starch molecular weight and amylose to amylopectin ratio. The objective of this study was to develop a new, simple, 1-step, and accurate method for simultaneous determination of amylose and amylopectin ratio as well as weight-averaged molecular weights of starch in food products. Starch from bread flour, canned peas, corn flake cereal, snack crackers, canned kidney beans, pasta, potato chips, and white bread was extracted by dissolving in KOH, urea, and precipitation with ethanol. Starch samples were solubilized and analyzed on a high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) system. To verify the identity of the peaks, fractions were collected and soluble starch and beta-glucan assays were performed additional to gas chromatography analysis. We found that all the fractions contain only glucose and soluble starch assay is correlated to the HPSEC fractionation.

After each step, replicate measurements were carried out with a liquid scintillation counter. Uncertainties in extraction and clean-up steps were estimated separately for every matrix and method combination by using within-laboratory reproducibility standard deviation and were characterised with the CV of recoveries. It was observed that the uncertainty of the ethyl acetate extraction step varied between 0.8% and 5.9%. The relative standard uncertainty of the clean-up step with dispersive SPE used in the method known as QuEChERS was estimated to be around 1.5% for tomato, apple and green beans. The highest variation of 4.8% was observed in cucumber.

Candidate ion identification using MassTRIX analysis software revealed that alterations in eicosanoid, fatty acid, TAG and steroid metabolism partially accounted for the differences observed in both PCA. In addition, evidence was obtained consistent with the hypothesis that the varying inhibitory effects on mammary carcinogenesis of genetically distinct dry bean types were mirrored by differential patterns of lipid metabolites in mammary carcinoma. The use of MassTRIX provided links for metabolite profile enrichment with metabolic pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.

Much effort has been expended towards the chemical characterisation of the components of the roasted coffee bean, frequently termed melanoidines, which are dominated byproducts formed from its most relevant secondary metabolites - chlorogenic acids. However, impeded by a lack of suitable authentic reference standards and analytical techniques sufficiently powerful for providing insight into an extraordinarily complex enigmatic material, unsurprisingly little structural and mechanistic information about the products of coffee roasting is available. Here we report on the characterisation of low molecular weight melanoidine fractions of roasted coffee using a conceptually novel combination of targeted and non-targeted mass spectrometrical techniques. We provide an unprecedented account of the chemical composition of roasted coffee beans. Using a targeted analytical approach we show for the first time, by comparison to authentic reference standards obtained by chemical synthesis, that chlorogenic acids follow four distinct reaction pathways including epimerization, acyl migration, lactonisation and dehydration. The analytical strategy employed in a non-targeted approach uses high resolution mass spectrometry to identify the most abundant molecular formulas present in roasted coffee samples and model roasts followed by van Krevelen and homologous series analysis. We identified the molecular formulas formed from reactions of chlorogenic acids, carbohydrates and proteins, both between classes of compounds and within same classes of compounds.

22339647,"Owing to possible adulteration and health concerns, it is important to discriminate between natural and synthetic food ingredients. A new method for compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) by coupling high-temperature reversed-phase liquid chromatography to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (HT-RPLC/IRMS) was developed for discrimination of natural and synthetic caffeine contained in all types of drinks. The analytical parameters such as stationary phase, column inner diameter, and column temperature were optimized for the separation of caffeine directly from drinks (without extraction). On the basis of the carbon isotope analysis of 42 natural caffeine samples including coffee beans, tea leaves, guaraná powder, and maté leaves, and 20 synthetic caffeine samples from different sources by high-temperature reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry, it is concluded that there are two distinguishable groups of caffeine δ(13)C-values: one between -25 and -32‰ for natural caffeine, and the other between -33 and -38‰ for synthetic caffeine. Isotope analysis by HT-RPLC/IRMS has been applied to identify the caffeine source in 38 drinks. Four mislabeled products were detected due to added but nonlabeled synthetic caffeine with δ(13)C-values lower than -33‰. This work is the first application of HT-RPLC/IRMS to real-world food samples, which showed several advantages: simple sample preparation (only dilution), high throughput, long-term column stability, and high precision of δ(13)C-value. Thus, HT-RPLC/IRMS can be a very promising tool in stable isotope analysis of nonvolatile compounds.",Analytical chemistry,"['D001628', 'D002110', 'D002247', 'D056148', 'D013058']","['Beverages', 'Caffeine', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Chromatography, Reverse-Phase', 'Mass Spectrometry']",Caffeine in your drink: natural or synthetic?,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22339647,2012

Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) can bind to proteins (PB FB(1)) and to other matrix components during food processing involving heat. The occurrence of bound fumonisins in processed corn foods is common. Another type of binding (or association) relates to observed instability of fumonisins in rice flour, corn starch and corn meal at room temperature; this can affect the immunoaffinity column clean-up procedure in analysis of naturally contaminated starch-containing corn foods for fumonisins. The occurrence of N-fatty acylated fumonisin derivatives in retail fried corn foods has also been demonstrated.

21251774,"In late February 2008, law enforcement officials in Las Vegas, Nevada, discovered in a hotel room, a copy of The Anarchist Cookbook, suspected castor beans and a ""white powder"" thought to be a preparation of ricin. Ricin is a deadly toxin from the seed of the castor bean plant (Ricinus communis). The United States regulates the possession, use, and transfer of ricin and it is the only substance considered a warfare agent in both the Chemical and the Biological Weapons Conventions. Six samples obtained from the hotel room were analyzed by laboratories at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using a panel of biological and mass spectrometric assays. The biological assays (real time-PCR, time resolved fluorescence and cytotoxicity) provided presumptive evidence of active ricin in each of the samples. This initial screen was followed by an in-depth analysis using a novel, state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based ricin functional assay and high sensitivity tandem mass spectrometry for protein identification. Mass spectrometric analysis positively identified ricin and confirmed that in each of the samples it was enzymatically active. The tandem mass spectrometry analysis used here is the most selective method available to detect ricin toxin. In each sample, ricin was unequivocally identified along with other R. communis plant proteins, including the highly homologous protein RCA120. Although database searches using tandem mass spectra acquired from the samples indicated that additional controlled substances were not present in these samples, the mass spectrometric results did provide extensive detail about the sample contents.

20722952,"Export of cocoa beans is of great economic importance in Ghana and several other tropical countries. Raw cocoa has an astringent, unpleasant taste, and flavor, and has to be fermented, dried, and roasted to obtain the characteristic cocoa flavor and taste. In an attempt to obtain a deeper understanding of the changes in the cocoa beans during fermentation and investigate the possibility of future development of objective methods for assessing the degree of fermentation, a novel combination of methods including cut test, colorimetry, fluorescence spectroscopy, NIR spectroscopy, and GC-MS evaluated by chemometric methods was used to examine cocoa beans sampled at different durations of fermentation and samples representing fully fermented and dried beans from all cocoa growing regions of Ghana. Using colorimetry it was found that samples moved towards higher a* and b* values as fermentation progressed. Furthermore, the degree of fermentation could, in general, be well described by the spectroscopic methods used. In addition, it was possible to link analysis of volatile compounds with predictions of fermentation time. Fermented and dried cocoa beans from the Volta and the Western regions clustered separately in the score plots based on colorimetric, fluorescence, NIR, and GC-MS indicating regional differences in the composition of Ghanaian cocoa beans. The study demonstrates the potential of colorimetry and spectroscopic methods as valuable tools for determining the fermentation degree of cocoa beans. Using GC-MS it was possible to demonstrate the formation of several important aroma compounds such 2-phenylethyl acetate, propionic acid, and acetoin and the breakdown of others like diacetyl during fermentation.

Most current commercial application of the supercritical extraction involve biologically-produced materials; the technique may be particularly relevant to the extraction of biological compounds in cases where there is a requirement for low-temperature processing, high mass-transfer rates, and negligible carrying over of the solvent into the final product. Special applications to food processing include the decaffeination of green coffee beans, the production of hops extracts, the recovery of aromas and flavors from herbs and spices, the extraction and fractionation of edible oils, and the removal of contaminants, among others. New advances, in which the extraction is combined with reaction or crystallization steps, may further increase the attractiveness of supercritical fluids in the bioprocess industries.

In the literature, few cases have described allergic reactions upon the exposure to green bean boiling steam or ingestion. Here, we describe five patients reporting documented adverse reactions upon the ingestion of cooked green beans, and we characterize the responsible allergen. Fresh and cooked green beans were tested by a prick + prick technique. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and IgE immunoblotting were performed with boiled vegetable extract, and the N-terminal sequence of the immunoreactive protein was obtained by analyzing the excised band in a protein sequencer. Immunoblotting inhibition of cooked green bean with in-house-purified peach lipid transfer protein (LTP) Pru p 3 was performed. An interesting green bean protein was chromatographically purified, tested with a pool serum, and inhibited with Pru p 3. Moreover, its molecular mass was determined by mass spectrometry. Prick + prick tests with raw and cooked green beans were positive for all of the patients. IgE immunoblotting showed that all of the patients reacted toward a unique IgE-binding protein at about 9 kDa. The obtained N-terminal sequence revealed the following amino acids: Ala-Ile-Ser-X-Gly-Qln-Val-Thr-Ser-Ser-Leu-Ala, corresponding to an LTP.

20172528,"The gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) deconvolution reporting software (DRS) from Agilent Technologies has been evaluated for its ability as a screening tool to detect a large number of pesticides in incurred and fortified samples extracted with acetone/dichloromethane/light petroleum (Mini-Luke method). The detection of pesticides is based on fixed retention times using retention time locking (RTL) and full scan mass spectral comparison with a partly customer built automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system (AMDIS) database. The GC-MS was equipped with a programmable temperature vaporising (PTV) injector system which enables more sample to be injected. In a blind study of 52 real samples a total number of 158 incurred pesticides were found. In addition to the 85 pesticides found by manual interpretation of GC-NPD/ECD chromatograms, the DRS revealed 73 more pesticides (+46%). The DRS system also shows its potential to discover pesticides which are normally not searched for (EPN in long beans from Thailand). A spiking experiment was performed to blank matrices of apple, orange and lettuce with 177 different pesticides at concentration levels 0.02 and 0.1 mg/kg. The samples were analysed on GC-MS full scan and the AMDIS match factor was used as a mass spectral quality criterion. The threshold level of the AMDIS match factor was set at 20 to eliminate most of the false positives. AMDIS match factors from 20 up to 69 are regarded only as indication of a positive hit and must be followed by manual interpretation. Pesticides giving AMDIS match factors at > or = 70 are regarded as identified. To simplify and decrease the large amount of data generated at each concentration level, the AMDIS match factors > or = 20 was averaged (mean AMF) for each pesticide including the commodities and their replicates. Among 177 different pesticides spiked at 0.02 and 0.1 mg/kg level, the percentage of mean AMF values > or = 70 were 23% and 80%, respectively. For 531 individual detections of pesticides (177 pesticides x 3 replicates) giving AMDIS match factor 20 in apple, orange and lettuce, the detection rates at 0.02 mg/kg were 71%, 63% and 72%, respectively. For the 0.1 mg/kg level the detection rates were 89%, 85% and 89%, respectively. In real samples some manual interpretation must be performed in addition. However, screening by GC-MS/DRS is about 5-10 times faster compared to screening with GC-NPD/ECD because the time used for manual interpretation is much shorter and there is no need for re-injection on GC-MS for the identification of suspect peaks found on GC-NPD/ECD.",Journal of chromatography.

19217948,"Lectins are a structurally diverse class of (glyco)proteins which bind mono- and oligosaccharides with high specificity and in a reversible way. For many years, the unique sugar binding properties of plant lectins have been exploited for the development of biochemical tools for glycoprotein isolation and characterisation, and the use of lectins as a glycoprofiling tool has became much more sophisticated with the advent of lectin microarrays, in which a panel of lectins are immobilized on a single chip for glycomic analysis. Among the numerous lectins studied so far, those from legumes represent the largest family. They can be present at relatively high amounts depending on genetic as well as environmental factors, and are accumulated especially in the seeds. For this reason, some lectins as the phytohemagglutinin from the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris constitute a possible risk, since consumption of raw or incorrectly processed beans has been shown to cause outbreaks of gastroenteritis, nausea and diarrhoea. On the other hand, for these anti-nutritional properties, bean extracts enriched in lectins or in lectin-related amylase inhibitors are also finding a growing use as active ingredients of ""weight-blockers"" in dietetic preparations for obesity treatment. Current methods to determine the lectin levels in foods are based on immunoenzymatic or toxicity tests, which are largely aspecific. Very recently, the availability of proteomic methodologies has allowed to start development and validation of sensitive and specific assays for detecting trace amounts of harmful lectins in either raw or processed foods. In this review, the main aspects of current and perspective applications of mass spectrometry and proteomic technologies to the structural characterisation of legumes are presented, with focus on issues related to detection, identification, and quantification of phytohemagglutinins relevant for their biochemical, immunological and toxicological aspects.",Journal of proteomics,"['D002846', 'D007887', 'D005504', 'D037102', 'D040901', 'D012639']","['Chromatography, Affinity', 'Fabaceae', 'Food Analysis', 'Lectins', 'Proteomics', 'Seeds']","Proteomic approaches to study structure, functions and toxicity of legume seeds lectins.

Two lines of black beans, one standard and the other biofortified (high) in Fe (71 and 106 microg Fe/g, respectively), were used. Maize-based diets containing the beans were formulated to meet the nutrient requirements for swine except for Fe (Fe concentrations in the 2 diets were 42.9 +/- 1.2 and 54.6 +/- 0.9 mg/kg). At birth, pigs were injected with 50 mg of Fe as Fe dextran. At age 28 d, pigs were allocated to the experimental diets (n = 10). They were fed 2 times per day for 5 wk and given free access to water at all times. Body weights and Hb concentrations were measured weekly. Hb repletion efficiencies (means +/- SEM) did not differ between groups and, after 5 wk, were 20.8 +/- 2.1% for the standard Fe group and 20.9 +/- 2.1% for the high Fe group. Final total body Hb Fe contents did not differ between the standard [539 +/- 39 mg (9.7 +/- 0.7 micromol)] and high Fe [592 +/- 28 mg (10.6 +/- 0.5 micromol)] bean groups (P = 0.15). The increase in total body Hb Fe over the 5-wk feeding period was greater in the high Fe bean group [429 +/- 24 mg (7.7 +/- 0.4 micromol)] than in the standard Fe bean group [361 +/- 23 mg (6.4 +/- 0.4 micromol)] (P = 0.034).

All food samples were randomly acquired in local markets, big supermarkets, and grocery stores of Reus (Catalonia). Foods included fish (sardine, hake, and tuna), meat (veal steak, loin of pork, breast and thigh of chicken, and steak and rib of lamb), string bean, potato, rice, and olive oil. For each food item, two composite samples were prepared for metal analyses, whose levels in raw and cooked (fried, grilled, roasted, and boiled) samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The highest concentrations of As, Hg, and Pb (raw and cooked samples) were mainly found in fish, with a clear tendency, in general, to increase metal concentrations after cooking. However, in these samples, Cd levels were very close to their detection limit. In turn, the concentrations of metals in raw and cooked meat samples were detected in all samples (As) or only in a very few samples (Cd, Hg, and Pb). A similar finding corresponded to string beans, rice, and olive oil, while in potatoes, Hg could not be detected and Pb only was detected in the raw samples. In summary, the results of the present study show that, in general terms, the cooking process is only of a very limited value as a means of reducing metal concentrations.

The overall percentage of fungal contamination in coffee was 98% and reduced to 60% after surface disinfection. There were remarkable ecological differences in the composition of ochratoxigenic species present in these two regions. Arabica coffee bean samples from the North had an average of 78% incidence of colonization with Aspergillus of section Circumdati with Aspergillus westerdijkiae and A. melleus as the predominant species. Aspergillus spp. of section Nigri were found in 75% of the samples whereas A. ochraceus was not detected. Robusta coffee beans from the South were 98-100% contaminated with predominantly A. carbonarius and A. niger. A. westerdijkiae was only found in one sample. The diversity of the fungal population was probably correlated with the geographical origin of the coffee, coffee cultivar, and processing method. Representative isolates of section Circumdati (52) and Nigri (82) were examined for their OTA production using HPLC with fluorescence detection. Aspergillus westerdijkiae (42 isolates out of 42), A. steynii (13/13), and A. carbonarius (35/35) in general produced large amounts of OTA, while one isolate of A. sclerotiorum produced intermediate amounts of OTA. 13% of the A. niger isolates produced OTA in intermediate amounts.

The overall sample treatment, which included extraction and centrifugation, took about 25-30 min, and several samples could be simultaneously treated using conventional lab equipment. No clean-up or solvent evaporation were required. Extraction efficiencies mainly depended on the decanoic acid and THF concentration in the aqueous solution and were not affected by the pH or the temperature in the ranges studied (1-4 and 20-60 degrees C, respectively).

18246504,"In this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was optimized and applied to the determination of endosulfan residues in 20 different kinds of food commodities including vegetables, dry fruits, tea and meat. The limit of detection (IC(15)) was 0.8 microg kg(-1) and the sensitivity (IC(50)) was 5.3 microg kg(-1). Three simple extraction methods were developed, including shaking on the rotary shaker at 250 r min(-1) overnight, shaking on the rotary shaker for 1 h and thoroughly mixing for 2 min. Methanol was used as the extraction solvent in this study. The extracts were diluted in 0.5% fish skin gelatin (FG) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at various dilutions in order to remove the matrix interference. For cabbage (purple and green), asparagus, Japanese green, Chinese cabbage, scallion, garland chrysanthemum, spinach and garlic, the extracts were diluted 10-fold; for carrots and tea, the extracts were diluted 15-fold and 900-fold, respectively. The extracts of celery, adzuki beans and chestnuts, were diluted 20-fold to avoid the matrix interference; ginger, vegetable soybean and peanut extracts were diluted 100-fold; mutton and chicken extracts were diluted 10-fold and for eel, the dilution was 40-fold. Average recoveries were 63.13-125.61%. Validation was conducted by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results of this study will be useful to the wide application of an ELISA for the rapid determination of pesticides in food samples.","Journal of environmental science and health. Part.

18079608,"Vitamin K is a cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), which is an essential enzyme for the gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins such as osteocalcin (OC). Associations among dietary vitamin K intake, vitamin K status, and bone metabolism have not been thoroughly investigated. Recently, it has been reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms of GGCX (R325Q, 974G>A) were associated with age-related bone loss and the kinetic affinity for the substrate. In the present study, we investigated the associations among dietary vitamin K intake, the level of serum vitamin K, and the ratio of undercarboxylated OC (ucOC) to intact OC. The subjects were 60 healthy young male volunteers (mean age, 22.6 y; standard deviation, 1.6). Dietary nutrient intake was assessed by consecutive individual 3-d food records taken before the day of blood examinations. Serum concentrations of vitamin K (phylloquinone: PK, menaquinone 4: MK-4, and menaquinone 7: MK-7), ucOC, and intact OC were measured. All subjects were genotyped for polymorphism (R325Q) presence. Dietary vitamin K intake from vegetables was significantly correlated with the level of serum PK, and vitamin K intake from fermented beans, natto, was also significantly correlated with the level of serum MK-7. The ratio of ucOC to intact OC showed a negative association with the total vitamin K intake (r=-0.331, p=0.010) and serum MK-7 (r=-0.394, p=0.002). Interestingly, grouped by the GGCX genotype, a significant interaction between the ratio of ucOC to intact OC with serum MK-7 was observed in 325R homozygotes (r=-0.572, p=0.003), but not in heterozygotes, nor in 325Q homozygotes.

17899033,"A liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS-MS) method based on the detection of biomarker peptides from allergenic proteins was devised for confirming and quantifying peanut allergens in foods. Peptides obtained from tryptic digestion of Ara h 2 and Ara h 3/4 proteins were identified and characterized by LC-MS and LC-MS-MS with a quadrupole-time of flight mass analyzer. Four peptides were chosen and investigated as biomarkers taking into account their selectivity, the absence of missed cleavages, the uniform distribution in the Ara h 2 and Ara h 3/4 protein isoforms together with their spectral features under ESI-MS-MS conditions, and good repeatability of LC retention time. Because of the different expression levels, the selection of two different allergenic proteins was proved to be useful in the identification and univocal confirmation of the presence of peanuts in foodstuffs. Using rice crisp and chocolate-based snacks as model food matrix, an LC-MS-MS method with triple quadrupole mass analyzer allowed good detection limits to be obtained for Ara h 2 (5 microg protein g(-1) matrix) and Ara h 3/4 (1 microg protein g(-1) matrix). Linearity of the method was established in the 10-200 microg g(-1) range of peanut proteins in the food matrix investigated.

Here, we analyzed the ergothioneine content in common foods using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Additionally, we assessed the protective potency of ergothioneine against various oxidative stressors in OCTN1-expressing cells in comparison with the main intracellular thiol antioxidant glutathione by evaluating cell viability with the MTT reduction assay. Only some food contained ergothioneine with highest concentrations detected in specialty mushrooms, kidney, liver, black and red beans, and oat bran.

The objective of the present study was to determine the levels of phytosterols, and squalene, as well as tocopherols (alpha and beta + gamma) in selected grains, seeds, and legumes. The method comprised acid hydrolysis and lipid extraction followed by alkaline saponification, prior to analysis by HPLC. In addition, the fatty acid profile of the foods was determined via total lipid extraction, fatty acid derivitisation and GC analysis. In general, beta-sitosterol was the most prevalent phytosterol, ranging in concentration from 24.9 mg/100 g in pumpkin seed to 191.4 mg/100 g in peas. Squalene identified in all foods examined in this study, was particularly abundant in pumpkin seed (89.0 mg/100 g). The sum of alpha- and beta+ gamma-tocopherols ranged from 0.1 mg/100 g in rye to 15.9 mg/100 g in pumpkin seeds. Total oil content ranged from 0.9% (w/w) in butter beans to 42.3% (w/w) in pumpkin seed and the type of fat, in all foods examined, was predominantly unsaturated.

To gain insight into the aroma compounds responsible for such odor changes, a comparative aroma extract dilution analysis was applied on unstored, raw Arabica coffee beans from Colombia (water content=11.75%) and on the same beans with a water content of 13.5%, which were stored for 9 months at 40 degrees C. In combination with the flavor dilution (FD) factors, the results of the identification experiments showed strong increases in (E)-beta-damascenone (cooked apple-like), 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (clove-like), and methyl 2-methyl- and methyl 3-methylbutanoate (fruity), whereas others, such as the earthy smelling 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine as well as 2-phenylethanol and 3-methoxyphenol, remained unchanged during storage. In addition, the previously unknown coffee odorant 2-methoxy-5-vinylphenol (intense smoky odor) increased significantly during storage. Quantitative measurements performed on raw coffee samples stored at various temperatures, water contents, and oxygen availabilities indicated that the significant increase of, in particular, the methyl esters of 2- and 3-methylbutanoic acid were responsible for the pronounced and fruity odor quality perceived in the stored green coffee, whereas the higher concentrations of 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and 2-methoxy-5-vinylphenol led to the more pronounced smoky, clove-like odor quality.

17364695,"Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world. It is consumed for its refreshing and stimulating properties. Carbohydrates are the major constituents of coffee beans and serve various functions like binding of aroma, stabilization of foam, formation of sedimentation, and increased viscosity of the extract. The principal low molecular weight carbohydrate is sucrose and no evidence of other simple oligosaccharides has been found. Polysaccharide fraction from green coffee is dominated by arabinogalactan, galactomannan, and cellulose. The polysaccharide content is reduced during roasting due to degradation to low molecular weight carbohydrates (viz., mono and oligosaccharide) and become more extractable. Various methods that can be employed to extract the carbohydrate from roasted coffee are sequential extraction, acid hydroloysis, hot water extraction, enzymatic extraction etc. Carbohydrates from coffee can be quantitatively determined by liquid chromatography, high performance anion exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography. Besides improving the organoleptic quality of the coffee beverage, carbohydrates also possess various biological activities such as lowering colon cancer risk. Besides their sheer mass, a variety of evidences testify to the important contribution that the polysaccharide content makes to the character of the final brew. Although a number of chemical and enzymatic methods have been devised to isolate and quantify the carbohydrates of R&G coffee, till date hot water extraction is the only method which can be accepted as a most feasible process and hence, there is wide scope of further research for the efficient and economically viable technology for extraction of carbohydrates from coffee.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,"['D003069', 'D004040', 'D005504']","['Coffee', 'Dietary Carbohydrates', 'Food Analysis']",An impression of coffee carbohydrates.,"['Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000295']","['chemistry', 'analysis', 'instrumentation']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17364695,2007

Recoveries were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 times the LOQ. At 1, 2, and 3 times the LOQ, the recoveries ranged from 89.4 to 108%, and the relative standard deviations ranged from 3.3 to 17.3% for all the matrixes. For apple juice, chicken broth, and infant formula, the averaged coefficients of determination from the linear regression analyses were >0.99 with each food fortified at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 times the LOQ. The coefficients of determination were >0.99 for green beans and 0.96 for peanut butter with the foods fortified at 1, 2, and 3 times the LOQ.

Although biological interest in this element has recently increased, limited literature exists on the Si content of foods. To further our knowledge and understanding of the relationship between dietary Si and human health, a reliable food composition database, relevant for the UK population, is required. A total of 207 foods and beverages, commonly consumed in the UK, were analysed for Si content. Composite samples were analysed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry following microwave-assisted digestion with nitric acid and H(2)O(2). The highest concentrations of Si were found in cereals and cereal products, especially less refined cereals and oat-based products. Fruit and vegetables were highly variable sources of Si with substantial amounts present in Kenyan beans, French beans, runner beans, spinach, dried fruit, bananas and red lentils, but undetectable amounts in tomatoes, oranges and onions. Of the beverages, beer, a macerated whole-grain cereal product, contained the greatest level of Si, whilst drinking water was a variable source with some mineral waters relatively high in Si.

16161695,"A low-cost thin-layer chromatographic method has been developed for the presumptive measurement of ochratoxin A (OTA) at 5 microg/kg in green coffee beans. The analytical method consisted of extracting OTA by shaking the beans with a mixture of methanol and aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, which was then purified by liquid-liquid partition into toluene. OTA was separated by normal-phase two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and detected by visual estimation of fluorescence intensity under a UV lamp at 365 nm. The chromatography solvents were toluene-methanol-formic acid (8:2:0.03) for the first development and petroleum ether-ethyl acetate-formic acid (8:10:1) for the second dimension development. This method was tested with uncontaminated green coffee bean samples spiked with an OTA standard at four different concentrations (5, 10, 20, and 30 microg/kg). The method is rapid, simple, and very easy to implement in coffee-producing countries. It is highly selective and does not involve the use of chlorinated solvents in the sample extraction step.

16019834,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the shelling process on the presence of ochratoxin A (OTA) in cocoa samples. Twenty-two cocoa samples were analysed for the determination of OTA before (cocoa bean) and after undergoing manual shelling process (cocoa nib). In order to determine OTA contamination in cocoa samples, a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection was used for the quantitative analysis of ochratoxin A (OTA). In both types of samples, OTA was extracted with methanol-3% sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and then purified using immunoaffinity columns prior to HPLC analysis. Due to the fact that different recovery values were obtained for OTA from both types of samples, a revalidation of the method in the case of cocoa nibs was needed. Revalidation was based on the following criteria: Selectivity, limits of detection and quantification (0.03 and 0.1 microg kg(-1), respectively), precision (within-day and between-day variability) and recovery 84.2% (RSD = 7.1%), and uncertainty (30%). Fourteen of the twenty-two cocoa bean samples (64%) suffered a loss of OTA of more than 95% due to shelling, six samples suffered a loss of OTA in the range 65-95%, and only one sample presented a reduction of less than 50%.

Hair or toenail arsenic concentration was not affected by sex, area of origin, place of residence and education, but toenail arsenic levels increased with age (p=0.029). Fish consumption was inversely related to arsenic levels, suggesting that consumption of beans , which are the main staple of poor people living in the study area who cannot afford to eat fish frequently, may be the source of arsenic exposure among the residents of Lahore and its suburban areas.

15796603,"The purpose of the following study was to investigate the influence of coffee roasting on the thiol-binding activity of coffee beverages, and to investigate the potential of various green bean compounds as precursors of thiol-binding sites by using promising ""in bean"" model roast experiments. Headspace gas chromatographic analysis on coffee brews incubated in the presence of the roasty-sulfury smelling 2-furfurylthiol for 20 min at 30 degrees C in septum-closed vessels revealed that the amounts of ""free"" thiol decreased drastically with increasing the roasting degree of the beans used for preparation of the brews. A half-maximal binding capacity (BC(50)) of 183 mg of 2-furfurylthiol per liter of standard coffee beverage was determined for a roasted coffee (CTN value of 67), thus demonstrating that enormous amounts of the odor-active thiol are ""bound"" by the coffee. Furthermore, biomimetic ""in bean"" precursor experiments have been performed in order to elucidate the precursor for the thiol-binding sites in the raw coffee bean. These experiments opened the possibility of studying coffee model reactions under quasi-natural roasting conditions and undoubtedly identified chlorogenic acids as well as thermal degradation products caffeic acid and quinic acid as important precursors for low-molecular-weight thiol-binding sites. In particular, when roasted in the presence of transition metal ions, chlorogenic acids and even more caffeic acid showed thiol-binding activity which was comparable to the activity measured for the authentic coffee brew.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001665', 'D002726', 'D002849', 'D040503', 'D005511', 'D005663', 'D006358', 'D009812', 'D012639', 'D013438']","['Binding Sites', 'Chlorogenic Acid', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Coffea', 'Food Handling', 'Furans', 'Hot Temperature', 'Odorants', 'Seeds', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds']","Screening of raw coffee for thiol binding site precursors using ""in bean"" model roasting experiments.","[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15796603,2005

Oxygen was essential for production of the emetic toxin by B. cereus. When beans, rice or tryptic soy broth were inoculated with cereulide producing strains B203, B116 (recent food isolates) or the strain F-4810/72, high amounts (2 to 7 microg ml(-1) or g(-1) wet wt) of cereulide accumulated during 4-day storage at room temperature. In parallel cultures and foods, stored under nitrogen atmosphere (> 99.5% N2), less than 0.05 microg of cereulide ml(-1) or g(-1) wet wt accumulated. The outcome of the bioassay matched that of the chemical assay, with no indication of interference by substances in the rice or beans. Boiling for 20 to 30 min did not inactivate cereulide or cereulide producing strains in rice or the beans. Adding l-leucine and l-valine (0.3 g l(-1)) stimulated cereulide production 10- to 20-fold in R2A and in rice water agar. When the B. cereus strains were grown on agar media under permissive conditions (air, room temperature), cereulide was produced overnight with little or no increase when the incubation was extended to 4 days. In broth culture, the production of cereulide started later than 16-24 h. Anoxic storage prevented cereulide production also when the amino acids had been supplied.

Analysis of the two main species of coffee (Arabica/Robusta) was achieved through an effective and simple sampling procedure, headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME), and the unprecedented resolving power of comprehensive gas chromatography (GC x GC). The combination of these two techniques proved to be a powerful tool for the extraction and separation of coffee volatiles. In fact, thousands of compounds that play various roles in the constitution of coffee aroma profile were resolved in the 2-D contour plot, each occupying a specific position pinpointed by two retention time coordinates. The potential use of this method for the assessment of coffee quality and the detection of commercial fraud is discussed. The potential of GC x GC for identification and classification of unknowns was also demonstrated, as the formation of characteristic patterns for structurally related compounds was observed in the bidimensional chromatogram.

Arsenic concentrations found in rice-based cereals (63-320 ng/g dry weight) were similar to those reported for raw rice. Results for the analysis of powdered infant formula by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) indicated a narrow and low arsenic concentration range (12 to 17 ng/g). Arsenic content in puree infant food products, including rice cereals, fruits, and vegetables, varies from <1 to 24 ng/g wet weight.

Because of the persistence of OTA in the food chain, exposure to the compound is a potential human health hazard. This has prompted adoption of regulatory limits in several countries which, in turn, implies the development of suitable validated and official analytical methods and rapid screening tests for cost-effective food control on a large scale. Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD), coupled with immunoaffinity column (IAC) clean-up, is the most widely employed analytical technique. LC coupled with electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (MS) has detection limits comparable with those of LC-FLD and the selectivity of IAC can be achieved by tandem (MS-MS) or sequential (MS(n)) detection. Synthetic counterparts to natural antibodies in the form of molecularly imprinted polymers seem a promising alternative to IAC for sample preparation.

AA was extracted with a mixture of water and acetone from homogenized food samples after the addition of 13C-labeled acrylamide (AA-1-(13)C) as an internal standard. The extract was concentrated, washed with dichloromethane for defatting, and cleaned up on Bond Elut C18, PSA and ACCUCAT cartridge-columns, and then AA was determined by LC/MS in the selected ion recording (SIR) mode. For the LC/MS analysis, four LC columns were connected in-line and the flow of the mobile phase was switched according to a time-program. Monitoring ions for AA were m/z 72 and 55, and those for AA-1-(13)C were m/z 73 and 56. AA and AA-1-(13)C were determined without interference from the matrices in all samples. The recoveries of AA from potato chips, corn snack, pretzel and roasted tea spiked at the level of 500 ng/g of AA were 99.5-101.0% with standard deviations (SD) in the range from 0.3 to 1.6%. The limits of detection and quantification of the developed method were 9 and 30 ng/g for AA in samples, respectively. The method was applied to the analysis of AA in various processed or cooked food samples purchased from retail markets. High levels of AA were found in potato chips and French-fried potato (467-3,544 ng/g). Fried and sugar-coated dough cakes (karinto) contained 374 and 1,895 ng/g.

These phenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health protecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic compounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known about alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the present study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount of selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In zucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic acid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin and quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In potatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, beans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher content of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with larger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of phenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was observed.

The current residue definition of dithiocarbamates in food for compliance with maximum residue limits, at national and international levels, is total residues arising from the use of any or each dithiocarbamate fungicide, determined as CS(2). The analytical method most frequently used to analyze dithiocarbamate residues in food for monitoring purposes was proposed more than 30 years ago. In this method, total dithiocarbamates are decomposed to CS(2), which is purified and reacted with a cupric reagent. The yellow complex formed is quantified by spectrophotometry. In this paper, a new reaction system for the purification and complexation of CS(2) is proposed.

Difficulties arise in attempting to analyze ricin because it is a large heterogeneous protein with glycosylation. The general protein identification scheme developed uses LC/MS or MALDI-TOF for size classification followed by the use of the same instrumentation for the analysis of the tryptic digest. Fragments of the digest can be searched in an online database for tentative identification of the unknown protein and then followed by comparison to authentic reference materials.

Separation conditions are optimized in terms of buffer pH, SDS concentration, and washing routine between injections. The best results in terms of peak resolution and reproducibility between separations were obtained with a MEKC running buffer at pH 5 with 100 mM SDS and a washing routine that includes a rinse step with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. Using this new MEKC method it is possible to separate in less than 5 min the seven substances. More interestingly, it is demonstrated that the low pH used in this MEKC method allows one to obtain clean electropherograms when samples are injected. The method is shown to be reproducible between different days with relative standard deviation (RSD) values lower than 1% for migration times and lower than 7% for peak areas (3 days, 24 injections). The usefulness of this procedure to determine these compounds in effluents from food processing (i.e., soaking water from lentils, white beans and black beans) and in food by-products (i.e., almond peels) considered as potential procyanidin sources is demonstrated.

The matrix enhancement effect is related to the blocking of active sites on the injector liner by matrix components, thereby increasing signal in the presence of matrix versus standards in solvent in which the pesticides themselves interact with the active sites. Graphitized carbon black (GCB) was often used in combination with various anion-exchange SPE cartridges. The extracts were then spiked with organophosphorus insecticides. These process standards were then compared to standards in acetone of the same concentration using gas chromatography with flame photometric detection or ion trap mass spectrometric detection.

Exhaustive modification of the arginine residues by phenylglyoxal did not lead to a marked loss of activity, suggesting that no arginine residue is directly associated with the inhibitory activity.

Further, two tyrosine residues were preferentially modified either by N-acetylimidazole or by tetranitromethane, resulting in a concomitant loss of most of the PHA-I activity.

The vegetables showed a large batch-to-batch variability, from 0.04 to 3.6, 5.9 and 36 mg total anthraquinone per kg fresh weight in peas, cabbage lettuce, and beans, respectively. Physcion predominated in all vegetables. In the herbs grape vine leaves, couch grass root and plantain herb, anthraquinones were above the limit of detection.

21781930,"The metabolites of oestrogenic substances of plant origin, phyto-oestrogens, have been proposed as cancer-protective agents in Asian and vegetarian populations. The two principle classes of these weak oestrogens are isoflavonoids and mammalian lignans. The former is derived from soya-based foods and the latter from oilseeds, cereals and whole grains. Asian populations such as the Japanese have high plasma concentrations of the isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, whereas vegetarians excrete large quantities of the lignan enterolactone, in their urine. The concentrations of these compounds in biological samples and foods are usually determined by GC-MS, although other techniques such as HPLC and LC-MS have also been used. A simple, robust method employing isotope dilution GC-MS will be described which could be applied to the determination of phyto-oestrogens in biological samples and food matrices. Briefly, samples are hydrolysed with β-glucuronidase, the aglycones extracted and the phyto-oestrogen fraction isolated by chromatography on Sephadex LH20. This fraction is then derivatised for GC-MS by reaction with N,O-bistrimethylsilyl-triflouroacetatamide to form trimethylsilyl derivatives. Using this technique we have determined the concentrations of the lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, and the isoflavonoids, equol, daidzein and genistein, in the serum of men from Japan (n=42). The mean levels of daidzein and genistein in these men were 82.5 ng/ml (range 1.9-577) and 158.6 ng/ml (range 5.3-852), respectively. The majority of these men (57%) produced equol concentrations of >5 ng/ml, with a mean value of 26.7 ng/ml. Mean Levels of enterodiol and enterolactone were 0.6 and 9.4 ng/ml, respectively. The levels of daidzein and genistein produced from the hydrolysis of soya bean hulls, soya bean hypocotyl, dehulled soya beans, soya flour, soya grit and soya concentrates have also been determined by this method.

Analytical difficulties were met with some combinations of commodity and mycotoxin and all results are uncorrected for recovery. The highest level was detected in a sample of maize gluten: 41 micrograms/kg of aflatoxin B1 (47 micrograms/kg total aflatoxins). Maize products also frequently contained fumonisins B1 and B2 at levels up to nearly 5,000 micrograms/kg in total and zearalenone up to a maximum level of 500 micrograms/kg. Ochratoxin A and citrinin were found in approximately 20% of wheat and barley samples. One sample of barley contained ochratoxin A at a level of 102 micrograms/kg and citrinin at a level of 8 micrograms/kg. Low levels of ochratoxin A also occurred in a few samples of other ingredients: rice bran, palm kernel and beans. Sterigmatocystin at 18 micrograms/kg was found in one sample of organically grown wheat and a trace amount of zearalenone in one sample of manioc.

8655094,"It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 mg/person, respectively.

Significant relationships were detected between the abundances of sandflies and aphids, suggesting aphid honeydew as a potential food source. Sugar meal analysis, using high-performance anion exchange (HPAE) chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) and the cold anthrone test, was used to demonstrate that significantly more sandflies fed on bean plants contaminated with aphids and honeydew than on uncontaminated beans. Furthermore, higher concentrations of sugars were detected in flies which fed on aphid/honeydew-contaminated beans, suggesting that sugar was more easily available and/or that honeydew/aphids act as phagostimulants for sandflies. Amongst wild sandflies collected from a bean field, significantly more female sandflies were 'sugar-positive' than males, though the sugar concentrations in positive sandflies were similar for both sexes.

The aim of this study was to develop a safe and relatively noninvasive method for studying Fe bioavailability (measured as percent Fe incorporation into red blood cells) in infants using 54Fe, 57Fe, and 58Fe stable isotopes. Four commonly used weaning foods were selected for study, labeled extrinsically with 57Fe- or 58Fe-enriched ferrous sulfate, and fed to five female and five male 9-mo-old fasting infants, using a multiple-dosing technique. Each food was given three times, labeled with one isotope, with a fruit juice drink containing 50 mg of ascorbic acid, and three times, labeled with a different isotope, with an ascorbic acid-free drink. Fourteen days after the last test meal, a blood sample was obtained from a heel-prick, spiked with a known amount of 54Fe, digested, and purified by ion exchange; isotopic enrichment and total Fe content were measured by quadrupole thermal ionization mass spectrometry.

The coffee lipid extracts were dissolved in olive oil (concentration either 5 mg CTL, 0.5 mg NSM or 0.5 mg DTA per 250 microliters olive oil) in study 1 and in coconut oil (concentration either 20 mg CTL, 2 mg NSM or 2 mg DTA per 250 microliters) in study 2. A dose of 250 microliters of these solutions was administered daily to hamsters by gavage. Control animals received 250 microliters vehicle only. For serum lipid analysis, blood samples were obtained on days 0, 7 and 14 in study 1 and on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 in study 2. Statistical analyses of the data in Study 1 indicated a tendency for serum total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol to increase with administration of CTL, NSM and DTA. In contrast, in study 2 there were no significant differences in serum lipid levels between control and coffee lipid-treated groups across time. In either study, total serum cholesterol levels of the three coffee lipid groups were not significantly different from each other. These results support the concept that coffee lipids may be hypercholesterolaemic and indicate that diterpenes could be the lipid component responsible for such an effect. However, it appears that this hypercholesterolaemic effect is apparent only when the background diet is low in saturated fat and cholesterol.

7892289,"Due to growing evidence suggesting that phytoestrogens might protect against various cancers, particularly against breast and prostate cancer, it is important to measure the exposure of populations to these compounds by determining levels in food and in human tissue or body fluids to assess the possible cancer protective properties of these agents. Therefore, we developed a simple and fast procedure to extract and simultaneously hydrolyze phytoestrogens and their conjugates from food items, and present a fast and selective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for precise determinations of the most common dietary phytoestrogens genistein, biochanin-A, daidzein, formononetin, and coumestrol using flavone as internal standard. For the first time HPLC was applied to measure these phytoestrogens and their most abundant metabolites equol and O-desmethyl-angolensin from human urine. The proposed methodology has been evaluated for losses due to thermal degradation during extraction and hydrolysis and due to sample handling during the entire work-up including solid phase extraction, and values are given for inter- and intra-assay variability. We present isoflavonoid levels of most common peas and beans used in ""western"" and ""eastern"" diets and compare isoflavonoid and coumestrol levels of raw, canned, and cooked foods which can be used in future epidemiological studies.

3027456,"Recently two groups of compounds with diphenolic structure, the lignans and the isoflavonic phytoestrogens, were detected and identified in human urine and other biological fluids. These compounds are of great biological interest because they exhibit both in vitro and in vivo weak estrogenic and sometimes also antiestrogenic activities and many plant lignans have been shown to have anticarcinogenic, antiviral, antifungal and other interesting biological effects. The compounds found in relatively large amounts (10-1000 times more than estrogens) in urine are modified by intestinal bacteria from plant lignans and phytoestrogens, which are present in fiber-rich food such as grain and beans. They bind with low affinity to estrogen receptors and preliminary results suggest that they may induce production of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in the liver and in this way may influence sex hormone metabolism and biological effects. Five compounds, the lignans enterolactone (Enl), enterodiol (End) and the isoflavonic phytoestrogen metabolites daidzein (Da), equol (Eq) and O-desmethylangolensin (O-Dma) were measured in urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (selected ion monitoring) using deuterated internal standards in 5 groups of women (total number 53). The members of three dietary groups (omnivores, lactovegetarians and macrobiotics) were living in Boston and of two groups in Helsinki (omnivores and lactovegetarians). Until now measurements have been carried out in 94 72-h samples. The highest mean excretion of the most abundant compound, enterolactone, was found in the macrobiotic group and the lowest in the omnivoric groups. Total mean 24-h excretion of enterolactone was 17,680 nmol in the macrobiotics, 4,170 nmol in the Boston lactovegetarians, 3,650 nmol in the Helsinki lactovegetarians, 2,460 nmol in the Helsinki omnivores and 2,050 nmol in the Boston omnivores. The other diphenols followed approximately the same pattern. In an earlier study the lowest excretion of enterolactone (1,040 nmol/24 h) was found in a group of postmenopausal apparently healthy breast cancer patients living in Boston. It is concluded that further studies are necessary to elucidate the possible role of these compounds in cancer and other diseases. However, the evidence obtained until now seems to justify the conclusion that these compounds may be among the dietary factors affording protection against hormone-dependent cancers in vegetarians and semivegetarians.",Journal of steroid biochemistry,"['D000818', 'D004032', 'D014676', 'D004967', 'D004968', 'D005247', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007529', 'D017705', 'D048789', 'D010936', 'D028321', 'D010944']","['Animals', 'Diet', 'Diet, Vegetarian', 'Estrogens', 'Estrogens, Non-Steroidal', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones', 'Lignans', 'Phytoestrogens', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Preparations', 'Plants']","Determination of urinary lignans and phytoestrogen metabolites, potential antiestrogens and anticarcinogens, in urine of women on various habitual diets.","[None, None, None, 'Q000652', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, None, 'urine', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3027456,1987

The influence of different concentration characteristics on the fumigation and the decomposition of phosphine residues was investigated in accordance with the fumigation technique. At the beginning the concentration increases, and after attaining the maximum gradually decreases to zero. The level of residues during the fumigation as well as the behaviour of residues during the storage of the fumigated products was monitored with a gas chromatographic method. The residues correlate with the concentration of phosphine, they also pass through a peak. The rate of decomposition of residues which had been formed in the phase of increasing concentration is greater than the rate of residues of equal magnitude which had been formed during the decreasing phase. When the concentration is even the maximum residue occurs later than the maximum concentration; when there is a steep trend both maximums coincide. This behaviour can be explained by the sorption and diffusion of phosphine. A comparison is made with the phosphine concentration which occurs during fumigation in practice. The parameters which produce a constant concentration trend with only one maximum and a non constant trend with an often increasing and decreasing concentration are discussed. The different behaviour of residues in these cases is described.

16657484,"An enzyme has been isolated from flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) which utilizes the product of lipoxidase for its substrate. The enzyme, termed hydroperoxide isomerase, converts the conjugated diene hydroperoxide of linoleic acid to the corresponding monoenoic ketohydroxy fatty acid. The structure of the latter has been determined by ultraviolet, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; periodate and permangate oxidation; gas chromatography; and thin layer chromatography. Hydroperoxide isomerase activity has also been demonstrated in crude extracts from barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat germ (Triticum aestivum), mung beans (Phaseolus aureus), and corn (Zea mays) and from partially purified extracts of soybean (Glycine max).The hydroperoxide isomerase enzyme from flaxseed has a pH optimum of 7.0. The enzyme was not inhibited by nordihydroguairetic acid, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, or cyanide, but it was inhibited by cupric ion. One hundred per cent of the activity was lost by heating the enzyme for 1 minute at 68 C. Both linoleic and linolenic acid hydroperoxides can serve as substrates for the enzyme. The pH optimum for the hydroperoxide isomerase enzyme from barley is 6.2; from wheat germ, 6.1; and from soybean, 6.1.The identification of the hydroperoxide isomerase enzyme clarifies the role of lipoxidase in plant tissue and suggests a participation of lipid in the electron transport system.",Plant physiology,[],[],Hydroperoxide isomerase: a new enzyme of lipid metabolism.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16657484,2010
