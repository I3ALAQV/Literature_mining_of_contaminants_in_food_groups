33772827,"Triazole fungicides may potentially harm human health. The 'quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe' approach has become popular for extraction and cleanup during pesticide residue analysis. We aimed to (a) validate a method for the simultaneous determination of myclobutanil, penconazole, tebuconazole, and triadimenol in squash using LC-MS/MS and (b) determine the pre-harvest intervals (PHIs) and assess the related risk of consuming squash cultivated under open-field conditions in Saudi Arabia. Using acetonitrile as the extraction solvent and fourfold dilution in deionized water led to weak signal suppression (<-6.1%). The limits of quantitation ranged from 10 to 40 μg/kg. Mean recovery and relative standard deviation ranged from 81.7 to 96.3% and from 3.6 to 11.4%. The half-lives ranged from 2.22 to 3.83 days, and the dissipation followed first-order kinetics. The terminal residues of myclobutanil, penconazole, tebuconazole, and triadimenol were <0.771, <0.307, <0.459, and <0.954 mg/kg, respectively, 7 days after two or three applications of recommended dosages. The PHIs of 7.1-11.4, 8.7-13.1, 3.8-5.3, and 11.3-14.3 days are suggested after the application of the recommended dose and double the recommended dose.

33541630,"The identification of polysaccharide structures in complex samples remains a unique challenge complicated by the lack of specific tools for polymeric mixtures. In this work, we present a method that depolymerizes polysaccharides to generate diagnostic oligosaccharide markers that are then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF MS). Rapid identification of food polysaccharides was performed by aligning the identified oligosaccharides with a library of oligosaccharide markers generated from standard polysaccharides. Measurements of standard and food polysaccharides were performed to obtain the contributions of the identified polysaccharides using percent peak coverage and angle cosine methods. The method was validated using a synthetic mixture of standard polysaccharides while the reproducibility was confirmed with experimental triplicates of butternut squash samples, where standard deviation was less than 3% for the relative abundance of oligosaccharides.

With the intent to determine minimal fit-for-purpose sample size, analyses were conducted for up to 93 incurred and added pesticide residues in 10 common fruits and vegetables processed using different sample comminution equipment. The commodities studied consisted of apple, banana, broccoli, celery, grape, green bean, peach, potato, orange, and squash. A Blixer® was used to chop the bulk samples at room temperature, and test portions of 15, 10, 5, 2, and 1 g were taken for analysis (n = 4 each). Additionally, 40 g subsamples (after freezing) were further comminuted using a cryomill device with liquid nitrogen, and test portions of 5, 2, and 1 g were analyzed (n = 4 each). Both low-pressure gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LPGC-MS/MS) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS/MS were used for analysis. An empirical approach was followed to isolate and estimate the measurement uncertainty contribution of each step in the overall method by adding quality control spikes prior to each step. Addition of an internal standard during extraction normalized the sample preparation step to 0% error contribution, and coefficients of variation (CVs) were 6-7% for the analytical steps (LC and GC) and 6-9% for the sample processing techniques. In practice, overall CVs averaged 9-11% among the different analytes, commodities, batches, test portion weights, and analytical and sample processing methods.

We measured changes in squash constituents during different storage periods to identify compounds that were suitable to be used as indices of storage quality. Principal components analysis of compounds at 1-5 months after harvest showed that PC1 scores were lower for cultivars with a higher rather than lower SQ (storage quality) ranks. Partial least-squares regression analysis was performed using the peak areas of all compounds identified from the 15 cultivars at 1 month after harvest as explanation variables and SQ as the target variable.

22761727,"There has been recent interest in the threat to bees posed by the use of systemic insecticides. One concern is that systemic insecticides may translocate from the soil into pollen and nectar of plants, where they would be ingested by pollinators. This paper reports on the movement of two such systemic neonicotinoid insecticides, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, into the pollen and nectar of flowers of squash (Cucurbita pepo cultivars ""Multipik,"" ""Sunray"" and ""Bush Delicata"") when applied to soil by two methods: (1) sprayed into soil before seeding, or (2) applied through drip irrigation in a single treatment after transplant. All insecticide treatments were within labeled rates for these compounds. Pollen and nectar samples were analyzed using a standard extraction method widely used for pesticides (QuEChERS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometric analysis. The concentrations found in nectar, 10 ± 3 ppb (mean ± s.d) for imidacloprid and 11 ± 6 ppb for thiamethoxam, are higher than concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides in nectar of canola and sunflower grown from treated seed, and similar to those found in a recent study of neonicotinoids applied to pumpkins at transplant and through drip irrigation. The concentrations in pollen, 14 ± 8 ppb for imidacloprid and 12 ± 9 ppb for thiamethoxam, are higher than those found for seed treatments in most studies, but at the low end of the range found in the pumpkin study.

21876772,"Powdery mildews (Erysiphales) are economically important plant pathogens that attack many agricultural crops. Conventional management strategies involving fungicide application face challenges, including the evolution of resistance and concerns over impacts on non-target organisms, that call for investigation of more sustainable alternatives. Mycophagous ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) feed on powdery mildew and have considerable potential as biological control agents; however, the foraging ecology and behavior of these beetles is not well understood. Here we document the olfactory cues presented by squash plants (Cucurbita moschata) infected by powdery mildew (Podosphaera sp.) and the behavioral responses of twenty-spotted ladybird beetles (Psyllobora vigintimaculata) to these cues. Volatile analyses through gas chromatography revealed a number of volatile compounds characteristic of infected plants, including 3-octanol and its analogues 1-octen-3-ol and 3-octanone. These compounds are typical ""moldy"" odorants previously reported in volatiles collected from other fungi. In addition, infected plants exhibited elevated emissions of several compounds also observed in collections from healthy leaves, including linalool and benzyl alcohol, which are reported to have anti-fungal properties. In Y-tube choice assays, P. vigintimaculata beetles displayed a significant preference for the odors of infected plants compared to those of healthy plants. Moreover, beetles exhibited strong attraction to one individual compound, 1-octen-3-ol, which was the most abundant of the characteristic fungal compounds identified. These results enhance our understanding of the olfactory cues that guide foraging by mycophagous insects and may facilitate the development of integrated disease-management strategies informed by an understanding of underlying ecological mechanisms.",PloS one,"['D000818', 'D001203', 'D001681', 'D001517', 'D028464', 'D003463', 'D005247', 'D009833', 'D010935', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Ascomycota', 'Biological Assay', 'Coleoptera', 'Cucurbita', 'Cues', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Plant Diseases', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Olfactory cues from plants infected by powdery mildew guide foraging by a mycophagous ladybird beetle.,"[None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000382', 'Q000032']","[None, 'physiology', None, 'physiology', 'microbiology', None, 'physiology', 'physiology', 'microbiology', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21876772,2011

Eighteen plots of 22 x 3.7 m each were separated using metal borders and the soil in six plots was mixed with MSS at 15 t acre(-1), six plots were mixed with MSS-YW at 15 t acre(-1) (on dry weight basis), and six unamended plots (no-mulch) were used for comparison purposes. Plots were planted with summer squash and heavy metals were analyzed in soil and mature fruits at harvest. Analysis of heavy metals in squash fruits was conducted using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. Zinc and Cu concentrations in soil mixed with MSS were extremely high compared to other metals. In squash fruits, concentrations of Zn were generally greater than Cu. Total squash marketable yield was greatest in MSS-YW and MSS treatments compared to no-mulch conventional soil. Concentrations of Cd and Pb in soil amended with MSS averaged 0.1 and 1.4 mg kg(-1), respectively. These levels were much lower than the limits in the U.S. guidelines for using MSS in land farming. Data revealed that maximum concentrations of Cd and Pb in squash fruits were 0.03 and 0.01 microg g(-1) dry fruit, respectively.

Pesticides were extracted from infant foods by using the procedure known as the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method. Quantification was based on matrix-matched standard calibration curves with the use of an isotopically labeled standard or a chemical analogue as the internal standard to obtain method accuracy. The method performance parameters, including overall recovery, intermediate precision, and measurement uncertainty, were evaluated on the basis of a nested design. The performance results were calculated by using a compiled SAS program that provided a semiautomated procedure for handling a large number of calculations in a few seconds.

19366669,"Although geneticists and archaeologists continue to make progress world-wide in documenting the time and place of the initial domestication of a growing number of plants and animals, far less is known regarding the critically important context of coalescence of various species into distinctive sets or complexes of domesticates in each of the world's 10 or more independent centers of agricultural origin. In this article, the initial emergence of a crop complex is described for one of the best-documented of these independent centers, eastern North America (ENA). Before 4000 B.P. there is no indication of a crop complex in ENA, only isolated evidence for single indigenous domesticate species. By 3800 B.P., however, at least 5 domesticated seed-bearing plants formed a coherent complex in the river valley corridors of ENA. Accelerator mass spectrometer radiocarbon dates and reanalysis of archaeobotanical assemblages from a short occupation of the Riverton Site in Illinois documents the contemporary cultivation at 3800 B.P. of domesticated bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa), sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macrocarpus), and 2 cultivated varieties of chenopod (Chenopodium berlandieri), as well as the possible cultivation of Cucurbita pepo squash and little barley (Hordeum pusillum). Rather than marking either an abrupt developmental break or a necessary response to population-packing or compressed resource catchments, the coalescence of an initial crop complex in ENA appears to reflect an integrated expansion and enhancement of preexisting hunting and gathering economies that took place within a context of stable long-term adaptation to resource-rich river valley settings.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"['D001106', 'D027462', 'D018556', 'D005843', 'D049690', 'D013058', 'D009656', 'D055110', 'D013997']","['Archaeology', 'Chenopodium', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'Geography', 'History, Ancient', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'North America', 'Radiometric Dating', 'Time Factors']",Initial formation of an indigenous crop complex in eastern North America at 3800 B.P.,"[None, 'Q000254', 'Q000266', None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'growth & development', 'history', None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19366669,2009

The CyPTIs (Cyclanthera pedata trypsin inhibitors) belong to a well-known squash inhibitor family. They contain 28-30 amino acids and have molecular weights from 3031 to 3367 Da. All the isolated inhibitors strongly inhibit bovine beta-trypsin (K(a)>10(11) M(-1)) and, more weakly, bovine alpha-chymotrypsin (K(a) approximately 10(4)-10(6) M(-1)). In the presence of 3 M NaCl the association constants of CyPTIs with alpha-chymotrypsin increased a few hundred fold. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, a high concentration of NaCl was used to isolate the inhibitors by affinity chromatography on immobilized chymotrypsin. It was found that although one of them, CyPTI IV, had split the Asn25-Gly26 peptide bond, its inhibitory activity remained unchanged. The hydrolyzed bond is located downstream of the reactive site.

Carotenoids, as well as tocopherols (vitamin E), are isoprenoid compounds formed by branches of a common biosynthetic pathway. Photodiode array HPLC analysis was used to simultaneously determine the content and composition of fruit-flesh carotenoids and tocopherols in five pairs of near-isogenic lines differing in the allelic state of genes previously identified as having profound effects on fruit color. The dominant B allele promoted carotenoid accumulation up to 5-fold and prevented tocopherol accumulation in all genetic backgrounds. The dominant L-2 allele doubled carotenoid content and, in combination with the dominant B allele, increased carotenoid content by 10-15-fold as compared to the recessive l-2 allele. The genes D and L-1 had no significant effects on mesocarp tocopherols or carotenoids content.

16310368,"In order to approach lucidin formation (a strong mutagen or a carcinogen) from a physiological standpoint, hairy roots of Rubia tinctorum L. were established by a transformation of Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain 15834 and cultured in a liquid woody plant medium without plant hormones. The anthraquinone pigment composition of the intact hairy roots was essentially the same as that of the intact non-transformed (normal) roots, in which lucidin O-beta-D-primeveroside (LuP) was one of the major pigments. Lucidin was scarcely detected in the intact hairy roots, but was a main pigment after the squash treatment. The crude protein extract of intact hairy roots exhibited LuP-glycosidase activity (an activity converting LuP to lucidin). This activity was also detected in the roots of the normal plants at a high level, but slightly in the stems and not in the leaves. Methyl jasmonate enhanced the LuP production and LuP-glycosidase activity in the hairy roots. On the other hand, ethephon or salicylic acid had either no effect or rather an inhibitory effect on them. After partial purification of LuP glycosidase, the resultant active fraction producing a major band with an apparent Mr of 68 kDa exhibited the substrate specificity for both aglycon and sugar-moiety. The sugar released from LuP by this fraction was neither D-glucose nor D-xylose and was hydrolyzed into them.

Marigold flower, a good rotation crop for the control of nematodes in tobacco fields was found to contain 0.77% lutein (after saponification, on dry basis). A high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method using a two-phase solvent system consisting of hexane-ethanol-water (6:4.5:1.5, v/v/v) was developed for the purification of lutein from the saponification mixture of marigold flower extract. The purity of lutein prepared using this HSCCC method was 97%. Free lutein was found to be the predominant form in three squash varieties, and it was mostly found in the peel rather than the commonly consumed flesh. Sweet Mamma, Buttercup and Pepper squash varieties contained 25.4, 18.4 and 30.1mg/100g fresh weigh (FW) of lutein in the peels, respectively. These concentrations were significantly higher than that in spinach and kale (3.7 and 12.3 mg/100 g FW). beta-Carotene was found most in the peel of Sweet Mamma squash at 13.6 mg/100g FW, whereas it was below 2mg/100g FW in all other samples. Cooking increased extractable free lutein by 22-65% in squash peels. Lutein in Yukon Gold potato was at ca. 0.4 mg/100 g FW. Certain Yukon Gold was also found to contain violaxanthin (0.35 mg/100 g FW). Structures of lutein, beta-carotene and violaxanthin were identified by LC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization MS in positive ion mode, and by comparing the retention time and UV-vis spectral data with standards.

Seafood is the main contributor to arsenic intake for adults while terrestrial-based food is the primary source for infants. Processed infant food products such as rice-based cereals, mixed rice/formula cereals, milk-based infant formula, applesauce and puree of peaches, pears, carrots, sweet potatoes, green beans, and squash were evaluated for total and speciated arsenic content. Arsenic concentrations found in rice-based cereals (63-320 ng/g dry weight) were similar to those reported for raw rice. Results for the analysis of powdered infant formula by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) indicated a narrow and low arsenic concentration range (12 to 17 ng/g). Arsenic content in puree infant food products, including rice cereals, fruits, and vegetables, varies from <1 to 24 ng/g wet weight. Sample treatment with trifluoroacetic acid at 100 degrees C were an efficient and mild method for extraction of arsenic species present in different food matrixes as compared to alternative methods that included sonication and accelerated solvent extraction. Extraction recoveries from 94 to 128% were obtained when the summation of species was compared to total arsenic. The ion chromatography (IC)-ICP-MS method selected for arsenic speciation allowed for the quantitative determination of inorganic arsenic [As(III) + As(V)], dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and methylarsonic acid (MMA). Inorganic arsenic and DMA are the main species found in rice-based and mixed rice/formula cereals, although traces of MMA were also detected. Inorganic arsenic was present in freeze-dried sweet potatoes, carrots, green beans, and peaches. MMA and DMA were not detected in these samples.

Lutein and zeaxanthin accumulate in the human macula and have been implicated in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The qualitative and quantitative distributions of lutein, zeaxanthin, and their (E/Z)-isomers in the extracts from some of the most commonly consumed fruits, vegetables, and pasta products were determined by HPLC employing a silica-based nitrile-bonded column. Green vegetables had the highest concentration of lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z), and the ratios of these carotenoids (L/Z) were in the range 12-63. The yellow-orange fruits and vegetables, with the exception of squash (butternut variety), had much lower levels of lutein in comparison to greens but contained a higher concentration of zeaxanthin.

9010939,"Cucurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor I (CMTI-I), a member of the squash-type protease inhibitor family, is composed of 29 amino acids and shows strong inhibition of trypsin by its compact structure. To study the structure-function relationship of this inhibitor using protein engineering methods, we constructed an expression system for CMTI-I as a fused protein with porcine adenylate kinase (ADK). A Met residue was introduced into the junction of ADK and CMTI-I to cleave the fusion protein with CNBr, whereas a Met at position 8 of authentic CMTI-I was replaced by Leu. Escherichia coli JM109 transformed with the constructed plasmid expressed the fused protein as an inclusion body. After cleavage of the expressed protein with CNBr, fully reduced species of CMTI-I were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and then oxidized with air by shaking. For efficient refolding of CMTI-I, we used 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) containing 0.1% PEG 6000 at higher protein concentration. Strong inhibitory activity toward trypsin was detected only in the first of three HPLC peaks. The inhibitor constant of CMTI-I thus obtained, in which Met8 was replaced by Leu, was 1.4 x 10(-10) M. The effect of replacement of Met with Leu at position 8 was shown to be small by comparison of the inhibitor constant of authentic CMTI-III bearing Lys at position 9 (8.9 x 10(-11) M) with that of its mutant bearing Leu at position 8 and Lys at position 9 (1.8 x 10(-10) M). To investigate the role of the well conserved hydrophobic residues of CMTI-I in its interaction with trypsin, CMTI-I mutants in which one or all of the four hydrophobic residues were replaced by Ala were prepared. The inhibitor constants of these mutants indicated that those with single replacements were 5-40 times less effective as trypsin inhibitors and that the quadruple mutant was approximately 450 times less effective, suggesting that the hydrophobic residues in CMTI-I contribute to its tight binding with trypsin. However, each mutant was not converted to a temporary inhibitor.",Protein engineering,"['D002851', 'D002942', 'D004926', 'D015870', 'D009154', 'D010940', 'D011485', 'D015202', 'D017510', 'D017434', 'D011993', 'D014361']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression', 'Mutation', 'Plant Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Trypsin Inhibitors']",Synthesis of a squash-type protease inhibitor by gene engineering and effects of replacements of conserved hydrophobic amino acid residues on its inhibitory activity.,"[None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000096', None, None, None, None, 'Q000096', 'Q000096']","[None, None, 'genetics', None, None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, None, None, 'biosynthesis', 'biosynthesis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9010939,1997

Following separation by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, ten tryptic peptides were sequenced. Based on the sequences of three tryptic peptides, three sets of mixed oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and used to screen a plasmid cDNA library prepared from poly(A)(+) RNA of ripe apple fruit. A 1.5-kb (kilobase) cDNA clone which hybridized to all three probes were isolated. The clone contained an open reading frame of 1214 base pairs (bp) encoding a sequence of 404 amino acids. While the polyadenine tail at the 3'-end was intact, it lacked a portion of sequence at the 5'-end. Using the RNA-based polymerase chain reaction, an additional sequence of 148 bp was obtained at the 5'-end. Thus, 1362 bp were sequenced and they encode 454 amino acids. The deduced amino-acid sequence contained peptide sequences corresponding to all ten tryptic fragments, confirming the identity of the cDNA clone. Comparison of the deduced amino-acid sequence between ACC synthase from apple fruit and those from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and winter squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) fruits demonstrated the presence of seven highly conserved regions, including the previously identified region for the active site. The size of the translation product of ACC-synthase mRNA was similar to that of the mature protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), indicating that apple ACC-synthase undergoes only minor, if any, post-translational proteolytic processing. Analysis of ACC-synthase mRNA by in-vitro translation-immunoprecipitation, and by Northern blotting indicates that the ACC-synthase mRNA was undetectable in unripe fruit, but was accumulated massively during the ripening proccess.

3450102,"Seven trypsin inhibitors were isolated from the seeds of Cucurbitaceae plants: two from cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and red bryony (Bryonia diotica) and one from figleaf gourd (Cucurbita ficifolia), spaghetti squash (Cucurbita pepo var. (vegetable spaghetti) and water melon (Citrullus vulgaris). The inhibitors were purified by fractionation with ammonium sulphate, followed by ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography using immobilized trypsin or anhydro-trypsin. The homogeneous inhibitors from cucumber and water melon are made up of 32 and 30 amino acid residues, respectively, whereas the remaining ones of 29 residues. All inhibitors contain three disulphide bridges and are free of threonine, phenylalanine and tryptophan. Inhibitors from spaghetti squash and CSTI IIb from cucumber are inactivated by acetylation of free amino groups whereas the remaining ones are inactivated by modification of arginine with 1,2-cyclohexanedione. Thus the P1 residues of the reactive sites of the inhibitors are lysine and arginine, respectively.",Acta biochimica Polonica,"['D000596', 'D010944', 'D012639', 'D014361']","['Amino Acids', 'Plants', 'Seeds', 'Trypsin Inhibitors']",Protein inhibitors of trypsin from the seeds of Cucurbitaceae plants.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000302']","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3450102,1988
3709886,"Plastics additives and processing aids present severe difficulties for the legislator attempting to establish meaningful controls. In many cases information both on the substances added to the plastic and on the species migrating into food, which may well be different, are lacking. In the studies reported, information has been sought on the actual components employed in two typical commercial plastics. Analysis has been carried out of both the composition and trace constituents of the ingredients of commercial PVC formulations used for manufacturing bottles for orange squash and cooking oil applications. Assessment of maximum leachable material was made by solvent extraction of the individual additives, which was compared with overall migration from the PVC bottles into food stimulants using proposed EEC Statutory Methods. Additionally, specific migration measurements of epoxidized soyabean oil, tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite, nonylphenol, pentaerythritol, and BHT antioxidant were carried out in food stimulants and where possible also in foods.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D055598', 'D002621', 'D002849', 'D002855', 'D004355', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D005526', 'D013058', 'D009821', 'D011143', 'D011145', 'D012997', 'D013024', 'D014885']","['Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Drug Stability', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Food, Formulated', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oils', 'Polyvinyl Chloride', 'Polyvinyls', 'Solvents', 'Soybean Oil', 'Waxes']",Compositional analysis of commercial PVC bottles and studies of aspects of specific and overall migration into foods and stimulants.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3709886,1986
4038708,"NADH:nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1) was isolated from squash cotyledons (Cucurbita maxima L.) by a combination of Blue Sepharose and zinc-chelate affinity chromatographies followed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-1.5m. These preparations gave a single protein staining band (Mr = 115,000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, indicating that the enzyme is homogeneous. The native Mr of nitrate reductase was found to be 230,000, with a minor form of Mr = 420,000 also occurring. These results indicate that the native nitrate reductase is a homodimer of Mr = 115,000 subunits. Acidic amino acids predominate over basic amino acids, as shown both by the amino acid composition of the enzyme and an isoelectric point for nitrate reductase of 5.7. The homogeneous nitrate reductase had a UV/visible spectrum typical of a b-type cytochrome. The enzyme was found to contain one each of flavin (as FAD), heme iron, molybdenum, and Mo-pterin/Mr = 115,000 subunit.

228939,"1. The copper protein mavicyanin has been isolated and purified from the green squash Cucurbita pepo medullosa. 2. Mavicyanin contains one type-1 copper/18000 Mr, which can be characterized by: intense absorption maximum at 600 nm (epsilon = 5000 M-1 cm-1/Cu, A280/A600 = 8.0 +/- 0.5, A600/A403 = 7.0 +/- 0.25, maximum of fluorescence emission at 335 nM. 3. In the oxidized state the copper of mavicyanin is 100% detectable by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Computer simulation of the rhombic EPR signal gives gz = 2.287, gy = 2.077, gx = 2.025, Az = 3.5 mT, Ay = 2.9 mT and Ax = 5.7 mT. 4. Like other simple type-1 copper proteins, such as stellacyanin, azurin or plastocyanin, mavicyanin is readily reduced by hydroquinone or L-ascorbic acid. Its midpoint potential E'm was determined to be + 285 mV.

228938,"1. Ascorbate oxidase has been isolated from the green squash Cucurbita pepo medullosa by a new purification method. Furthermore a low-molecular-weight copper protein containing one type-1 copper/20000 Mr could be separated during the purification of the oxidase. The six-step procedure developed improved the yield of ascorbate oxidase by a factor of 2.5. The method is well reproducible and a constant value of 8 Cu (7.95 +/- 0.1/140000 Mr) has been established. By ultracentrifugal and electrophoretic criteria the enzyme preparations have been found to be homogeneous. They exhibited a specific activity of 3930 +/- 50 units/mg protein or 1088 +/- 15 units/microgram copper. 2. The pure enzyme is characterized by the following optical purity indices: A280/A610 = 25 +/- 0.5, A330/A610 = 0.65 +/- 0.05 and A610/A500 = 7.0 +/- 0.25. The molar absorption coeffient of the characteristic absorption maximum at 610 nm (oxidized minus reduced) amounts of 9700 M-1 cm-1 . 3. Computer simulations of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of the oxidized enzyme reveal the following parameters: for the type-1 (blue) copper gz = 2.227, gy = 2.058, gx = 2.036; Az = 5.0 mT, Ay = Ax = 0.5 mT, for the type-2 (non-blue) copper g parallel to = 2.242, g perpendicular = 2.053; A parallel to = 19.0 mT, A perpendicular 0.5 mT. Out of the eight copper atoms present in the oxidase four are detectable by EPR. Of these, three belong to the type-1 class, and one to the type-2 class, as demonstrated by computer simulations of the EPR spectra. 4. To achieve full reduction of the enzyme, as measured by bleaching of the blue chromophore, four equivalents of L-ascorbate or reductase must be added in the absence of molecular oxygen. Upon reduction of the enzyme the fluorescence at 330 nm (lambda max ex = 295 nm) is enhanced by a factor of 1.5 to 1.75. The reduced enzyme is readily reoxidized by dioxygen, ferricyanide or hydrogen peroxide. It binds two molecules of hydrogen peroxide in the oxidized state (1/type-3 Cu pair), which can be monitored by a characteristic increase of the absorbance around 310 nm (delta epsilon = 1000 +/- 50 M-1 cm-1).
