35275370,"Lead (Pb) is a highly neurotoxic chemical element known for reducing intelligence quotient (IQ) and promoting antisocial behavior in children and adolescents, while cadmium (Cd) is a carcinogenic bioaccumulative element. Both these metals are included in the priority pollutant list of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and in the WHO List of Chemicals of Major Public Health Concern, where contaminated foods and beverages are the most common pathways of exposure. The objective of this study was to determine total Cd and Pb levels in colored plastic utensils (cups, mugs, bowls, feeding bottles, and plates) for use by children and to measure the specific migration of these elements into beverages and foods. Total contaminant levels were determined using a handheld X-ray fluorescence analyzer. Specific migration tests were conducted using the simulant solutions acetic acid 3% (m/v) and water. Migration levels were determined by ICP-MS. Specific migration tests for Pb were also performed on commercially available samples (cola soft drink, orange juice, vinegar, and milk), with levels determined by graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF-AAS). A total of 674 utensils were analyzed in loco at major commercial centers in Greater São Paulo, of which 87 were purchased for containing Cd and Pb concentrations above permitted limits. Mean concentrations of the metals detected in the purchased utensils were 1110 ppm for Pb and 338 ppm for Cd. For specific migration assays, Pb levels were 187, 13, and 380 times above the permitted limit (0.01 mg.kg -1) for acetic acid, water, and orange juice, respectively. Cd levels were 50 and 2.4 times above the maximum permitted limit (0.005 mg.kg -1) for acetic acid and water, respectively. The districts where the utensils were purchased were grouped according to their social vulnerability index and compared using ANOVA. Pb levels were different between low and medium/high social vulnerability groups (p = 0.006). The findings corroborate the initial hypothesis that these utensils constitute a major source of exposure to PTEs such as Cd and Pb, pointing to the need for stricter regulation and inspection by the Brazilian regulatory agencies.",Environmental science and pollution research international,[],[],Study of controlled migration of cadmium and lead into foods from plastic utensils for children.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35275370,2022
35053922,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of high-pressure processing (HPP) (600 MPa during 5 min) on emerging mycotoxins, enniatin A (ENNA), enniatin A1 (ENNA1), enniatin B (ENNB), enniatin B1 (ENNB1) reduction in different juice/milk models, and to compare it with the effect of a traditional thermal treatment (HT) (90 °C during 21 s). For this purpose, different juice models (orange juice, orange juice/milk beverage, strawberry juice, strawberry juice/milk beverage, grape juice and grape juice/milk beverage) were prepared and spiked individually with ENNA, ENNA1, ENNB and ENNB1 at a concentration of 100 µg/L. After HPP and HT treatments, ENNs were extracted from treated samples and controls employing dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction methodology (DLLME) and determined by liquid chromatography coupled to ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS-IT). The results obtained revealed higher reduction percentages (11% to 75.4%) when the samples were treated under HPP technology. Thermal treatment allowed reduction percentages varying from 2.6% to 24.3%, at best, being ENNA1 the only enniatin that was reduced in all juice models.

Betalains are nutritious pigments which have valuable biological properties, e.g., antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity. In this study, aqueous betalain extracts were obtained from different coloured cactus pears (purple, red/pink, and orange), amaranth, and beetroot, with and without the addition of ascorbic acid, microwave-heated, and freeze-dried and subsequently analysed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Beetroot samples without the addition of ascorbic acid (AA) had lower phenols, flavonoids, and ascorbic acid content than beetroot samples extracted with the addition of AA. Amaranth had significantly higher contents of antioxidants than all the other plants. Results for phenolic compounds showed that there were no significant differences between cactus pear cultivars, however, significant differences were seen between the two beetroot samples (microwave-heated with and without AA) as well as amaranth. For flavonoid compounds, amaranth had significantly higher values than all other samples. The lowest flavonoid content was found in beetroot without AA (0.49 mgCE/g). For ascorbic acid, significant differences were noticed between amaranth (71.71 mg/100 g) and samples from cactus pear and beetroot. TLC results showed that purple and red cactus pear samples had the most vivid colours, a reflection of the high betacyanin and betaxanthin contents in the cultivars. Moreover, extracts from cactus pear, beetroot, and amaranth were classified according to a decision tree which was designed by the Code of Federal Regulations/Food Additives Regulation of the EU. The classification of betalain pigment extracts as colouring foods was achieved through enrichment factor calculations and the colourant decision tree.

The compounds which reported the highest area values in each chromatography were evaluated through their substance groups and polarity values. The impact of matrix effects obtained in tomato matrix was similar for both cases; however, SFC clearly showed better results in analyzing matrices with a higher number of natural co-extracted compounds. This can be explained by the combination of two effects: (i) chromatography separation and (ii) ion source efficiency. The chromatographic elution presented different profiles of matrix components, which had diverse impact on the coelution with the analytes, being more beneficial when SFC was used in the matrices studied.

The effect of HPP has also been compared with a thermal treatment performed at 90 °C during 21 s. For this, different juice models, orange juice/milk beverage, strawberry juice/milk beverage and grape juice, were prepared and spiked individually with AOH and AFB1 at a concentration of 100 µg/L. After HPP and thermal treatments, mycotoxins were extracted from treated samples and controls by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and determined by HPLC-MS/MS-IT.

34203867,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studying and exploring the potential health benefits of foods, mainly from vegetables and fruits from regular intake. The presence of secondary metabolites, namely polyphenols, carotenoids and terpenes, in certain food matrices seems to contribute to their functional properties, expressed through an increased prevention in the development of certain chronic diseases, namely coronary heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and diabetes. However, some foods' volatile secondary metabolites also present important bioactive properties, although this is a poorly scientifically explored field. In this context, and in order to explore the potential bioactivity of volatile metabolites in different vegetables and fruits from regular consumption, the volatile composition was established using a green extraction technique, solid phase microextraction in headspace mode (HS-SPME), combined with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 320 volatile metabolites, comprising 51 terpenic compounds, 45 organosulfur compounds, 31 aldehydes, 37 esters, 29 ketones, 28 alcohols, 23 furanic compounds, 22 hydrocarbons, 19 benzene compounds, 13 nitrogenous compounds, 9 carboxylic acids, 7 ethers, 4 halogenated compounds and 3 naphthalene derivatives, were positively identified. Each investigated fruit and vegetable showed a specific volatile metabolomic profile. The obtained results revealed that terpenic compounds, to which are associated antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities, are the most predominant chemical family in beetroot (61%), orange carrot (58%) and white carrot (61%), while organosulfur compounds (antiviral activity) are dominant in onion, garlic and watercress.

In this work, a simple method used for microplasma-induced vapor generation (μPIVG) was developed for the rapid screening and quantification of mercury in fruits and vegetables without sample preparation. A stainless-steel capillary was partly inserted into a juice droplet from the tested fruits and then the sample liquid automatically moved to the end of the capillary with the assistance of inherent capillary driving force. Subsequently, a high voltage was applied between the capillary and a tungsten electrode to generate microplasma wherein the juice was sprayed and the mercury ions contained in the juice were converted to mercury cold vapor (Hg0). The Hg0 was finally separated from the liquid phase and swept to an atomic fluorescence spectrometer (AFS) for rapid screening. A standard addition method coupled with μPIVG atomic fluorescence spectrometry was further used for the quantitative analysis of the suspected sample. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.4 μg L-1 were obtained for the tested tomato, lemon, and orange samples, respectively.

33856048,"To facilitate the production of tomato products with high bioactivity and improve the utilization of orange-colored tomatoes, the carotenoids of 11 tomato cultivars were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. Moreover, antioxidant activities were evaluated by four chemical-based assays, and the influences of thermal treatment on the carotenoids in orange-colored tomatoes rich in tetra-cis (7Z, 9Z, 7'Z, and 9'Z)-lycopene, phytofluene, and phytoene were studied. The nine orange-colored tomatoes (OT) were divided into two categories: OT-B, containing five cultivars rich in β-carotene, and OT-L, containing the other four cultivars that were abundant in tetra-cis-lycopene, phytofluene, and phytoene. The antioxidant activities of OT-L were higher than those of OT-B and the SD-2 cultivar in OT-L showed similar antioxidant activity to the red tomatoes. During thermal processing, tetra-cis-lycopene in SD-2 decreased about 38% after being exposed to heat for 2 hr at 80 °C, while its content was still higher than other lycopene isomers. Other-Z-lycopenes and all-trans (E)-lycopene increased from 2.36 ± 0.19 to 14.73 ± 1.16 µg/g fresh weight (FW) and 0.75 ± 0.10 to 5.91 ± 1.02 µg/g FW, respectively. Thus, thermal treatments at lower temperature, such as cold break and pasteurization, were more suitable for processing OT-L. The results demonstrated that OT-L could be an excellent raw material to produce tomato products with high bioavailability and bioactivity. The results of this research could provide helpful information for the research and development of tomato products using orange tomatoes and benefit planters and consumers.

33773743,"The use of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for the simultaneous target and non-target analysis of pesticide residues in food control is a subject that has been studied over the last decade. However, proving its efficacy compared to the more established triple quadrupole mass spectrometers (QQQ-MS2) is challenging. Various HRMS platforms have been evaluated, seemingly showing this approach not to be as effective as QQQ-MS2 for quantitative analysis, especially in routine food testing laboratories. The two main reasons are (i) the lower sensitivity especially in the case of the fragment ions produced and (ii) the lack of familiarity and an understanding of the most appropriate combination of HRMS acquisition modes to use. In fact, the number of different acquisition modes can appear as a puzzle to inexperienced users. This work was therefore focused on obtaining experimental data to gain a better understanding of the extended acquisition capabilities of a new Q-Orbitrap platform. Experimental data were obtained for 244 pesticides and their degradation products in commodities of varying matrix complexity (tomato, onion, avocado, and orange) using various combinations of acquisition modes. The best results for targeted analysis were obtained with a combination of full scan (FS), all-ions fragmentation (AIF) and target MS2 (tMS2) modes, and for non-target analysis using full scan (FS) and data-dependent MS2 (ddMS2) modes. All these acquisition modes (FS, AIF, tMS2, and ddMS2) could be applied simultaneously with cycle times ≤ 1 s. The tMS2 especially, proved to be a very powerful approach to increase sensitivity for MS2 fragments and identification rates. Overall, the results for the various pesticide-commodity combinations were fully satisfactory in terms of limit of quantitation (LOQ) repeatability and identification when considered against the SANTE EU Guideline criteria. In addition, the screening capabilities were evaluated for a non-target survey with the use of spectral libraries, the presence of non-target compounds was detected, thus proving the efficacy of the proposed approach. Another issue often overlooked is the optimization of use of spectral libraries, but in our experiments the compounds present in these libraries were not blindly sought in the screening analyses. To minimize the potential for false positives detects in our study, the extractability of the compounds present in the libraries, was also taken into account. The extractability of compounds using a QuEChERS acetonitrile procedure was estimated based on the physicochemical properties of target compounds.

Different extraction approaches, sorbents, chromatographic columns and mobile phases were investigated for establishment of an optimal QuEChERS procedure and UHPLC-MS/MS conditions. Recoveries were in the range of 74-110%, and the limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 0.05 to 0.1 ng mL-1 and from 0.1 to 5.0 ng mL-1, respectively. Matrix effects were evaluated and matrix-matched calibration curves were used to compensate for matrix effects and achieve accurate quantification. The correlation coefficients (R2) of linearity were higher than 0.99 and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of intra- and inter-day precision were under 13%. The method was subsequently applied to 22 fruit juice samples.

33184759,"The toxic protein of ricin has drawn wide attention in recent years as a potential bioterrorism agent due to its high toxicity and wide availability. For the verification of the potential anti-terrorism activities, it is urgent for the quantification of ricin in food-related matrices. Here, a novel strategy of trypsin/Glu-C tandem digestion was introduced for quantitative detection of ricin marker peptides in several beverage matrices using isotope-labeled internal standard (IS)-mass spectrometry. The ricin in beverages was captured and enriched by biotinylated anti-ricin polyclonal antibodies conjugated to streptavidin magnetic beads. The purified ricin was cleaved using the developed trypsin/Glu-C tandem digestion method and then quantitatively detected by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) with isotope-labeled T7A and TG11B selected as IS. The use of trypsin/Glu-C digestion allows shorter peptides, which are more suitable for MS detection, to be obtained than the use of single trypsin digestion. Under the optimized tandem digestion condition, except for T7A in the A-chain, two resulting specific peptides of TG13A, TG28A from the A-chain and two of TG11B, TG33B from the B-chain were chosen as novel marker peptides with high MS response. The uniqueness of the selected marker peptides allows for unambiguous identification of ricin among its homologous proteins in a single run. The MS response of the four novel marker peptides is increased by more than 10 times compared with that of individual corresponding tryptic peptides. Both the marker peptides of A-chain T7A and B-chain TG11B were selected as quantitative peptides based on the highest MS response among the marker peptides from their individual chains. The limit of detection (LOD) of ricin is 0.1 ng/mL in PBS and 0.5 ng/mL in either milk or orange juice. The linear range of calibration curves for ricin were 0.5-300 ng/mL in PBS, 1.0-400 ng/mL in milk, and 1.0-250 ng/mL in orange juice. The method accuracy ranged between 82.6 and 101.8% for PBS, 88.9-105.2% for milk, and 95.3-118.7% for orange juice. The intra-day and inter-day precision had relative standard deviations (%RSD) of 0.3-9.4%, 0.7-8.9%, and 0.2-6.9% in the three matrices respectively. Furthermore, whether T7A or TG11B is used as a quantitative peptide, the quantitative results of ricin are consistent. This study provides not only a practical method for the absolute quantification of ricin in beverage matrices but also a new strategy for the investigation of illegal use of ricin in chemical weapon verification tasks such as OPCW biotoxin sample analysis exercises.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D001628', 'D019921', 'D002138', 'D002851', 'D007553', 'D057230', 'D008280', 'D010455', 'D011786', 'D015203', 'D012276', 'D012680', 'D012997', 'D019809', 'D053719', 'D014357']","['Beverages', 'Biotinylation', 'Calibration', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Limit of Detection', 'Magnetics', 'Peptides', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Ricin', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solvents', 'Streptavidin', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Trypsin']",Quantitative detection of ricin in beverages using trypsin/Glu-C tandem digestion coupled with ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184759,2021
33165660,"Monascus purpureus, a pigment-producing ascomycetous fungus, has been traditionally used for red rice preparation using solid-state fermentation. The objective of this study was to develop an improved pigment-producing strain of M. purpureus MTCC 1090 through genome shuffling followed by detailed analytical estimations of pigments and other bioactive compounds produced by the fusant. Protoplast formation was optimum with 12 h-old mycelia incubated at 30 °C with cellulase, lyticase, and chitinase (40:1:1) for 5 h. Four UV-induced mutants that produced 13.1-39.5% higher amount of yellow, orange, and red pigments in fermented low-grade (cheap) broken rice were used as parents for genome shuffling. After the first round of fusion, four fusants with 35.9-60.52% higher pigment production capabilities were fused again, and finally the fusant F2-19 with distinct culture characteristic was selected under multi-selection pressure. It consistently produced 67%, 70%, and 76% higher content of yellow, orange, and red pigments respectively as compared to the wild-type. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis also reveals clear variation in pigment productions between wild-type and the fusant. Furthermore, HPLC analysis of F2-19 fermented rice extract confirms the production of 186 ± 8.71 and 3810 ± 29.81 mg/kg mevinolin and gamma-aminobutyric acid respectively. Citrinin was not detected. F2-19 fermented rice also has high antioxidant activity (7.92 ± 0.32 mg/g trolox equivalent), with good amount of phenolics (18.0 ± 0.95 mg/g gallic acid equivalent) and flavonoids (2.7 ± 0.26 mg/g quercetin equivalent). Thus, genome shuffling was successfully implemented on M. purpureus for the first time to develop a citrinin-free, better-performing fusant that holds future biotechnological potential. KEY POINTS: • Genome shuffling was performed by recursive protoplast fusion in Monascus purpureus. • The selected fusant, F2-19, was used in solid-state fermentation using low-grade rice. • It produced 67-76% higher content of yellow, orange, and red pigments than the wild-type. • HPLC detected 186 mg/kg mevinolin and 3810 mg/kg γ-aminobutyric acid, but no citrinin. • F2-19 shows high antioxidant activity with good amount of phenolics and flavonoids.

32645020,"The increasing prevalence of individuals with multiple food allergies and the need to distinguish between foods containing homologous, cross-reactive proteins have made the use of single-analyte antibody-based methods (e.g., ELISAs) sometimes insufficient. These issues have resulted in the need to conduct multiple analyses and sometimes employ orthogonal methods like mass spectrometry or DNA-based methods for confirmatory purposes. The xMAP Food Allergen Detection Assay (xMAP FADA) was developed to solve this problem while also providing increased throughput and a modular design suitable for adapting to changes in analytical needs. The use of built-in redundancy provides the xMAP FADA with built-in confirmatory analytical capability by including complementary antibody bead sets and secondary analytical end points (e.g., ratio analysis and multi-antibody profiling). A measure of a method's utility is its performance when employed by analysts of varying expertise in multiple laboratory environments. To gauge this aspect, a multi-laboratory validation (MLV) was conducted with 11 participants of different levels of proficiency. The MLV entailed the analysis of incurred food samples in four problematic food matrices, meat sausage, orange juice, baked muffins, and dark chocolate. Except for a couple of instances, involving two confirmatory components in the analysis of baked muffins, the allergenic foods were detected by all participants at concentrations in the analytical samples comparable to ≤ 10 μg/g in the original food sample. In addition, despite high levels of inter-lab variance in the absolute intensities of the responses, the intra-laboratory reproducibility was sufficient to support analyses based on the calibration standards and direct comparison controls (DCCs) analyzed alongside the samples. In contrast, ratio analyses displayed inter-laboratory %CV (RSDR) values < 20%; presumably because the ratios are based on inherent properties of the antigenic elements. The excellent performance of the xMAP FADA when performed by analysts of varying proficiency indicates a reliability sufficient to meet analytical needs.",PloS one,"['D000485', 'D000906', 'D001681', 'D003429', 'D004797', 'D005504', 'D005512', 'D006801', 'D007753', 'D013058', 'D015203']","['Allergens', 'Antibodies', 'Biological Assay', 'Cross Reactions', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Humans', 'Laboratories', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Reproducibility of Results']","Multi-laboratory validation of the xMAP-Food Allergen Detection Assay: A multiplex, antibody-based assay for the simultaneous detection of food allergens.","['Q000276', 'Q000276', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000175', None, None, None, None]","['immunology', 'immunology', None, None, 'methods', 'methods', 'diagnosis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645020,2020

In this paper, pesticide residues in mandarins, tangerines and oranges from China were evaluated, as well as the quality and long-term dietary risks for the Chinese consumers. Temporal variations for eight MRL non-compliant pesticides were also investigated. 106 pesticides were analyzed using QuEChERS procedure and UPLC-MS/MS, GC-MS and GC methods. Forty different pesticides were detected in 86% of the 2922 samples from 2013 to 2018. Chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected pesticide with a detection rate of 40%. Residues of eight pesticides in 3.8% of the total samples exceeded their MRLs. The most severely excessive pesticide was bifenthrin with 283% MRL. The occurrences and exceeding rates of eight pesticides presented clear temporal variations during the six harvesting years. Isocarbophos, carbofuran and triazophos were the main risk factors threatening the citrus safety pre-2015, whereas profenofos and bifenthrin gradually became dominant after 2016, coinciding with government control measures. The index of quality for residues (IqR) levels of 88% of the samples were below 1.0, which indicated a satisfactory quality of citrus fruits in China, although 70% of the samples contained two or more residues. The cumulative chronic dietary risks were acceptable for both the Chinese general population and children and would not pose health risks.

32305833,"In the present work, we report a novel chemical approach for the synthesis of orange-red emitting copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) using L-methionine as stabilizing agent at room temperature for the first time. The synthetic route is facile, economical and viable. The methionine stabilized copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs/Met) were thoroughly characterized by TEM, FT-IR, XPS, UV-Vis, steady state and transient fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show the synthesized Cu NCs/Met with a fluorescence quantum yield of 4.37% possessed high stability and excellent optical features such as large Stokes shift and long fluorescence lifetime (8.3 μs). Significantly, the fluorescence intensity of Cu NCs/Met could be efficiently quenched by norfloxacin (NOR) pharmaceutical. A fast and cost-effective NOR sensor was proposed employing Cu NCs/Met as the fluorescent nanoprobe, and the quenching mechanisms were attributed to inner filter effect and agglomeration-induced quenching. The developed sensor exhibited a high sensitivity and selectivity towards NOR in a wide linear range from 0.05 to 250 μM with a detection limit as low as 17 nM. Moreover, the practicability of the developed NOR sensor for real sample assay was validated with satisfactory recoveries, indicating this sensing platform with great potential for label-free pharmaceutical detection in complex systems.","Spectrochimica acta.

32159564,"Multiple emissions of blue, green and red from a molecular imprinting sensor rationally constructed, were used for the fluorescence colorimetric visualization of a fluorescent analyte of folic acid, using a flexible post-imprinting mixing strategy. That is, two kinds of folic acid-templated molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were firstly synthesized by encapsulating green and red fluorescent quantum dots (g-QDs and r-QDs) individually on SiO2 cores, and they were then mixed at an appropriate ratio, resulting in a triple emission MIPs sensor. Upon folic acid recognition, the inherent blue fluorescence of folic acid was intensified, and the green and red fluorescence of the sensor QDs were gradually quenched. The quenching rate difference between g-QDs and r-QDs was greatly enhanced and used to obtain a wider-range and profuse fluorescence color evolution, by investigating the influences of the QDs modifier, eluent and imprinting layer thickness in detail. Under optimal conditions, the ratiometric intensity change of the three color emissions varied in a logistic function within 0.01-50 ppm of folic acid, and the corresponding fluorescence colors shifted from yellow to orange to red to purple and finally to blue. This excellent visualization capability of the MIPs sensor contributed to the accurate naked-eye detection of folic acid concentration using a portable ultraviolet lamp. Moreover, the MIPs sensor succeeded in determining folic acid in complicated food and serum samples, providing comparable results with the PRC standard method and satisfactory recoveries of 99.5-108.0%.

This fact is due to the existence of many residue definitions but also due to the lack of robust instrumental methods for the evaluation of these isomeric compounds. However, supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (SFC-ESI-MS/MS) has been demonstrated to perform fast and highly efficient separations without the need to change the mobile phase employed in multiresidue pesticide analyses. Regarding chiral stationary phase columns, the polysaccharide-based ones clearly demonstrate the best separation technology. Two polysaccharide-based columns were tested in this study, and the robustness of their combination with SFC was verified. The enantiomers of lambda-cyhalothrin and metalaxyl were studied precisely due to their markedly distinct toxicity and enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the acute reference dose for gamma-cyhalothrin is half in comparison with its enantiomer (0.0025 and 0.005 mg/kg respectively), which is present in the lambda-cyhalothin residue definition. These enantiomers were analyzed in terms of linearity, reproducibility, and matrix effects in four representative matrices (tomato, orange, leek, and cayenne).

The idea behind this study is to track for first time the transformations underwent of nanoparticles in the different steps of their route from packaging to the consumer.

31351956,"To reduce animal testing, there is a need to develop novel in-vitro models for evaluating the retention of bioactive compounds in food and pharmaceutical products. Here, a mucus-mimetic platform was developed through a one-step approach based on encapsulating mucin within alginate gel beads. We found that mucins form micron sized aggregates distributed across the surface of the calcium-alginate bead, as shown by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Retention of bioactive compounds on the mucin-functionalised surface was tested using a commercial orange drink formulation. To aid flavour retention, different mucoadhesive polymers with varying charge, including anionic, neutral and strongly cationic, were tested for their ability to interact with mucin and aid retaining flavour compounds within the mucin-alginate bead. The alginate-mucin mucus mimic was validated using an ex-vivo bovine tongue, with the flavour retention results showing qualitative agreement. The developed method proved to be a convenient, efficient tool for providing information on the effectiveness of mucoadhesive polymers without variability, safety and sustainability issues associated with an ex-vivo or in-vivo system.

31336117,"The aim of this study was to investigate the antiproliferative effects of fucoidan from three regional hijiki (Hizikia fusiforme) samples (Zhejiang-China, Jeju-Korea [JH], and Wando-Korea) in East Asia. Hijiki was processed using 1% citric acid to decrease heavy metal content. The JH sample was separated using diethylaminoethyl-cellulose-ion exchange chromatography to obtain four active fractions (JHCF1-JHCF4) and their monosaccharide composition was detected using high-performance liquid chromatography. The structure of the crude polysaccharides and four fucoidan fractions was analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. JHCF4 showed the highest fucose and sulfate content and decreased Hep3B cell growth in 48 h with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 33.53 ± 2.50 μg/ml, which represented the strongest anticancer activity. Further, nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 and acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining demonstrated that the anticancer activity of JHCF4 was mediated by apoptosis. Moreover, JHCF4 down-regulated B-cell lymphoma extra-large, while up-regulating Bcl-2-associated X protein, caspase-3, and apoptotic bodies to different degrees in Hep3B cells. JHCF4 induced apoptosis via the generation of reactive oxygen species along with the concurrent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating the potential role of the mitochondria-mediated pathway.

31229100,"Phenotypic characteristics, as well as the relation between carotenoid accumulation and gene expression during ripening were determined in fruits of five new hybrids between tangor cv. 'Murcott' and sweet orange cv. 'Pêra'. The genotypes were classified into the orange-like group, showing mainly epoxycarotenoids, oval fruit shape and yellowish color, or in the mandarin-like group, showing mainly β-cryptoxanthin, flattened shape and deep-orange coloration; although some hybrids presented intermediate characteristics. The diversity in carotenoid composition of hybrids and genitors were mostly explained by patterns of gene expression. High carotenoid (250-426 μg/g dry weight [dw]) and β-cryptoxanthin (81-125 μg/g dw) contents, observed in the mandarin-like group, were generally associated with high expression of upstream genes (GGPPS1, PSY, PDS). On the other hand, low expression/repression of these genes and high expression of downstream genes (BCHX and ZEP) were associated with low carotenoid (~158 μg/g dw) and β-cryptoxanthin (5-22 μg/g dw) contents and epoxycarotenoid accumulation, as occurred in the orange-like group. Breeding experiments resulted in hybrids with outstanding higher carotenoid contents than both genitors (up to 426 μg/g dw versus 158-250 μg/g dw in genitors), which was attributed to transgressive segregation.

In this work, R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) proteins encapsulated into ZIF-8 composite thin films were prepared via a solid-confinement conversion process and applied as fluorescent sensors for mercury ion detection. The R-PE proteins encapsulated into ZIF-8 exhibit dual color emissions including green (518 nm) and red (602, 650 nm) fluorescence, while the original orange emission (578 nm) of pure R-PE is significantly suppressed. R-PE@ZIF-8 presents excellent selectivity and sensitivity for mercury detection in a large pH range without buffer solution. Under the optimal conditions, there is a good linear relationship between the fluorescence quenching efficiencies of R-PE@ZIF-8 and logarithmic concentrations of mercury ions in the range of 0.001-50 μM with the detection limit (LOD) of 6.7 nM much lower than the guideline value given by the World Health Organization.

31113980,"Foods and beverage aroma results from multicomponent mixtures of volatile compounds present in the food that interact with olfactory receptors and produce a perceptual response in the brain. However, the perceptual interactions that occur when complex odor mixtures are combined are not well understood. Here we used Gas chromatography-Recomposition-Olfactometry (GC-R) to better understand the role that individual compounds have on the perceived sensory aroma of bitters. Bitters are the concentrated alcoholic extract of flavorful plant materials with a wide range of complex sensory and chemical aroma profiles that have not been extensively studied. Previously, we demonstrated that Angostura bitters are characterized by complex aroma attributes described as cola, ginger, orange peel, and black pepper and that the volatile composition of Angostura bitters is predominantly composed of terpenoids. Using GC-R to create in-instrument mixtures of the Angostura headspace extracts, the sensory attributes of Angostura extracts with linalool, α-terpinyl-acetate and caryophyllene omitted were evaluated. The omission experiments demonstrated direct and indirect effects of the individual compounds on the aroma attributes of Angostura bitters, through masking, additive, and synergistic interactions. Caryophyllene in particular, which was present in the headspace extracts at concentration only slightly above sensory threshold levels, had a large and unexpected impact on the sensory properties of the mixtures and may be most responsible for the aromas associated with the whole sample.

31065708,"Yellow and orange egg yolks are good sources of xanthophyll carotenoids, consumption of which is associated with health benefits, such as cancer prevention, eye health, and bone health. Industrial feed fortificants used to improve egg yolk color and carotenoid concentration typically are derived from marigold flowers. Green leafy vegetables are also concentrated sources of the xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin (L+Z), but they have not been rigorously evaluated in laying hen feeds as a yolk colorant. The addition of food manufacturing byproducts, including carrot leaves, to animal feed is a promoted method of improving animal nutrition. The ability of dehydrated carrot leaves to improve egg yolk color and L+Z concentration was evaluated by feeding laying hens (n = 40) white maize-based feeds fortified with 2 different dehydrated carrot leaves, marigold as a positive control, or no fortificant as a negative control for 28 D. After a 7-D washout period, the hens were separated into 4 groups, and eggs were collected every other day. Yolks were analyzed by using a portable colorimeter to define the color space and by ultra-performance liquid chromatography to determine the carotenoid profile. Carotenoid concentration rapidly declined from day 0 to 8, confirming adequate washout conditions. The white maize negative control (WM) day 28 lutein concentration (3.59 ± 0.51 nmol/g) was significantly less than orange-carrot leaf-treated (OCL) (5.34 ± 0.36 nmol/g) and red-carrot leaf-treated hens (RCL) (5.92 ± 1.00 nmol/g) in addition to the marigold-treated hens (MG). However, MG was significantly higher than both leaf-treated groups. From day 8 (3.93 ± 0.74 nmol/g) to 28 (9.32 ± 1.66 nmol/g), MG had the largest increase in lutein and was the only treatment to surpass day 0 initial concentrations (8.50 ± 1.64 nmol/g).

There is great interest in these methods for metabolomic, environmental, forensic, and food safety applications, among others, to determine compounds that are responsible for a particular disease state or the presence of a harmful compound. In order for non-targeted analyses to become standardized and routine, best practices for sample preparation, data collection, and data analysis must be determined. This work focuses on optimizing specific aspects of a non-targeted workflow that utilizes high-resolution mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap instrument coupled to liquid chromatography. Sample preparation, liquid chromatography gradient length, and mass spectrometry resolving power and ionization modes were investigated to determine optimal conditions for detecting and extracting compounds from the data that cover broad molecular and polarity ranges. Infant rice cereal, orange juice, and yogurt with spiked standards were analyzed; food is inherently challenging to analyze due in part to sample complexity and diversity. Of the conditions tested, optimal conditions included a generic sample extraction using acetonitrile, water, and formic acid, a 25 min chromatographic gradient, collecting data in both positive and negative ion modes, and using 70 k resolving power.

However, thermo-sensitivity, lipophilicity and formulation-dependent efficacy bring challenges in the development of functional foods, enriched with phytosterols and tocopherols. To address this, we developed liposomes containing brassicasterol, campesterol and β-sitosterol obtained from canola oil deodorizer distillate, along with alpha, gamma and delta tocopherol. Three approaches; thin film hydration-homogenization, thin film hydration-ultrasonication and Mozafari method were used for formulation. Validated liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was utilized to determine the entrapment efficiency of bioactives. Stability studies of liposomal formulations were conducted before and after pasteurization using high temperature short time (HTST) technique for a month. Vesicle size after homogenization and ultrasonication (<200 nm) was significantly lower than by Mozafari method (>200 nm). However, zeta potential (-9 to -14 mV) was comparable which was adequate for colloidal stability. Entrapment efficiencies were greater than 89% for all the phytosterols and tocopherols formulated by all three methods. Liposomes with optimum particle size and zeta potential were incorporated in model orange juice, showing adequate stability after pasteurization (72 °C for 15 s) for a month.

Different dilution factors for the final extract were also evaluated in order to check the impact on the matrix effects. The optimised method was validated for matrices from different commodity groups. Recovery studies performed with grapes, lettuce, orange, oat and soya beans showed absolute average recoveries in the range 70-120% with relative standard deviation values below 20% for almost all the pesticides tested. The matrix effects observed were very different in each matrix and for each individual pesticide evaluated. Therefore, isotopically labeled procedural internal standards were used for all compounds in order to correct for recovery and matrix effects. Method Limits of Quantification for most analyte-matrix combinations were 0.02 or 0.05 mg kg",Journal of chromatography.

30699169,"The consumption of sweet oranges has been linked to several health benefits, many of which are attributed to hesperidin, a flavanone that is present in high amounts in these fruits. However, other phenolic compounds can contribute to the bioactivity of sweet orange. To link those effects to their phenolic profile, the complete characterization of the phenolic profile is mandatory. Although many studies have profiled the phenolic composition of orange juices, their pulps, which retain phenolic compounds, are overlooked. This fact is particularly relevant because dietary guidelines recommend the consumption of whole fruits. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a specific method for the optimal extraction of phenolics from orange pulp and to use this method to characterize these fruits grown at different locations by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The extraction conditions that reported the highest total polyphenol content (TPC) and hesperidin contents were 20 mL/g, 55 °C, and 90% methanol. The extraction time and number of sequential steps were further evaluated and optimized as 20 min and two extraction steps, respectively. Although lower extraction rates were achieved when using ethanol as the extraction solvent, high TPC and hesperidin yields were obtained, suggesting the potential use of this methodology to produce phenolic-rich extracts for the food industry. By applying the optimized methodology and analyzing the extracts by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, geographic cultivation regions were demonstrated to affect the phenolic profiles of oranges. In short, we developed a quick, easy-to-perform methodology that can be used to extract orange phenolics from pulp for their identification and quantification and to evaluate the factors that affect the phenolic profile in sweet orange pulps.",PloS one,"['D002851', 'D032084', 'D006569', 'D010936', 'D059808', 'D012997', 'D013030', 'D053719']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Hesperidin', 'Plant Extracts', 'Polyphenols', 'Solvents', 'Spain', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Optimization of a polyphenol extraction method for sweet orange pulp (Citrus sinensis L.) to identify phenolic compounds consumed from sweet oranges.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699169,2019

30341661,"Our results provide a comprehensive overview how the alloplasmic condition might lead to a significant improvement in citrus plant breeding, developing varieties more adaptable to a wide range of conditions. Citrus cybrids resulting from somatic hybridization hold great potential in plant improvement. They represent effective products resulting from the transfer of organelle-encoded traits into cultivated varieties. In these cases, the plant coordinated array of physiological, biochemical, and molecular functions remains the result of integration among different signals, which derive from the compartmentalized genomes of nucleus, plastids and mitochondria. To dissect the effects of genome rearrangement into cybrids, a multidisciplinary study was conducted on a diploid cybrid (C2N), resulting from a breeding program aimed to improve interesting agronomical traits for lemon, the parental cultivars 'Valencia' sweet orange (V) and 'femminello' lemon (F), and the corresponding somatic allotetraploid hybrid (V + F). In particular, a differential proteomic analysis, based on 2D-DIGE and MS procedures, was carried out on leaf proteomes of C2N, V, F and V + F, using the C2N proteome as pivotal condition. This investigation revealed differentially represented protein patterns that can be associated with genome rearrangement and cell compartment interplay. Interestingly, most of the up-regulated proteins in the cybrid are involved in crucial biological processes such as photosynthesis, energy production and stress tolerance response. The cybrid differential proteome pattern was concomitant with a general increase of leaf gas exchange and content of volatile organic compounds, highlighting a stimulation of specific pathways that can be related to observed plant performances.

Although the proteome of circulating red cells has been the subject of several reports, the cellular populations used for these studies were never completely devoid of reticulocytes. In our current study, we used highly purified erythrocyte and reticulocyte populations to quantify the absolute expression levels of the proteins in each cell population. Erythrocytes and reticulocytes were purified in a multistep process involving cellulose chromatography, Percoll gradient centrifugation, and fluorescence cell sorting after thiazole orange labeling. Proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry from whole cells and erythrocyte plasma membrane (ghosts), leading to the identification and quantification of 2077 proteins, including 654 that were reticulocyte-specific. Absolute quantifications of these proteins were made using the mean corpuscular hemoglobin content of the cells as a standard. For each protein, we calculated the percentage loss during the terminal stages of reticulocyte maturation and the percentage of association with the plasma membrane. In addition, we used modified adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate molecules that enable the transfer of a biotin molecule to the catalytic sites of kinases to isolate active kinases in the erythrocytes and determined the absolute expression of 75 protein kinases and the modification of their expression during reticulocyte maturation. Our findings represent the first absolute quantification of proteins that are specifically expressed in normal erythrocytes with no detectable contamination by reticulocytes.

To simplify selection for DE, the potential of serum composition to predict AMEn was evaluated based on 40 birds from two broiler lines (D+ and D-) divergently selected on the fecal AMEn of a difficult-to-digest wheat-based diet. Differences in serum coloration were suspected between the two lines, and thus a spectrophotometric analysis was carried out, revealing a significant difference in absorption between 430 nm and 516 nm, corresponding to the signature of orange-red lipophilic pigments such as xanthophylls. To go further, the liposoluble fraction of the serum was explored for its lipidome by mass spectrometry. Discriminant analysis revealed that a pattern of 10 metabolites, including zeaxanthin/lutein, can explain 82% of the lipidomic differences between the two lines.

This technique has demonstrated to be useful for avoiding degradation generated in the hot inlet. Limitations observed for OCI in routine analysis were injection volume, guard column length, and maintenance issues. Analytical standards spiked in vegetable solutions were injected in OCI, not observing any thermal degradation rate. On the contrary, classical splitless injection (SLI) produced high degradation rates in all cases. This OCI approach was validated in citrate QuEChERS extracts of tomato, apple, and orange matrices for these four compounds and their corresponding transformation products (THPI, DCBP, and PI), evaluating recoveries, repeatability, linearity, and matrix effect. This set-up enabled the correct identification and quantitation for most compounds at LOQs of 0.010 mg/kg in fruit and vegetable samples. The OCI grants evident differentiation between metabolites naturally occurring in food and thermal degradation products created during the analysis.

As dietary intake is identified as one of the dominant exposure pathways to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), a cross-sectional study involving determination of their levels in food of plant origin has been conducted. Locally-grown and imported fruit and vegetable samples, collected in 2016 were inspected for 10 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) using QuEChERS as sample pre-treatment procedure followed by micro-HPLC-MS/MS. Three of 10 target analytes, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were quantitatively determined. The detection frequency for PFASs across the 55 samples analysed was less than 10%.

In this study, we describe the sourcing of VR present in food based on chemical analysis of attribution signatures by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) combined with multivariate data analysis. Analytical data was acquired from seven different foods spiked with VR batches that were synthesized via six different routes in two separate laboratories. The synthesis products were spiked at a lethal dose into seven food matrices: water, orange juice, apple purée, baby food, pea purée, liquid eggs and hot dog. After acetonitrile sample extraction, the samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS operated in MRM mode. A multivariate statistical calibration model was built on the chemical attribution profiles from 118 VR spiked food samples. Using the model, an external test-set of the six synthesis routes employed for VR production was correctly identified with no observable major impact of the food matrices to the classification.

29496188,"Supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry has been evaluated for pesticide residues in food. In order to check its advantages and limitations it was developed a method to identify and quantify 164 pesticides in three different matrices (tomato, orange and leek). A carbon dioxide gradient with methanol (containing 1 mM ammonium formate) was used allowing a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min that made the total run time of 12 min without any problem of overpressure. Addition of a post column flow 150 μL/min of Methanol with ammonium formate/formic acid was necessary to improve the ionization. The matrix effect study revealed that the percentages of pesticides with irrelevant matrix effect (suppression lower than 20%) was 99% in tomato, 87% in orange and 62% in leek, whereas significant suppression (higher than 50%) was not found in tomato and only 1% of the compounds in orange and 3% in leek.These results compare favorably with that typically obtained in LC-MS/MS. The absence of water in the mobile phase, also provided some important advantages regarding LC-MS/MS as (i) higher retention of polar compounds in the column, which elute with high sensitivity and good peak shape and (ii) a general increase of the sensitivity of the analysis, consequence of the high ionization and ion extraction efficiency. Pesticides evaluated were identified following the SANTE/11813/2017. At the spiking concentration of 5 μg/kg, 98% of the pesticides were identified in tomato, 98% in orange and 94% in leek, whereas for the concentration of 10 μg/kg all the compounds were identified in tomato and only spiromesifen was not identified in orange and leek. At the concentration of 20 μg/kg, spiromesifen was also identified in these two matrices. The linearity and reproducibility of the method were evaluated with results which guarantee high quality in the analytical measurements. Even though only 2 μL of final extract were injected, the sensitivity of the SFC method was enough to achieve stringent LOQs.Real samples, including 6 different fruits and vegetables, were analyzed by the SFC-MS/MS proposed method, the results being similar to those obtained by LC-MS/MS. The method was also applied to a proficiency test of fipronil in eggs with good results in all the cases.

With the intent to determine minimal fit-for-purpose sample size, analyses were conducted for up to 93 incurred and added pesticide residues in 10 common fruits and vegetables processed using different sample comminution equipment. The commodities studied consisted of apple, banana, broccoli, celery, grape, green bean, peach, potato, orange, and squash. A Blixer® was used to chop the bulk samples at room temperature, and test portions of 15, 10, 5, 2, and 1 g were taken for analysis (n = 4 each). Additionally, 40 g subsamples (after freezing) were further comminuted using a cryomill device with liquid nitrogen, and test portions of 5, 2, and 1 g were analyzed (n = 4 each). Both low-pressure gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LPGC-MS/MS) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS/MS were used for analysis. An empirical approach was followed to isolate and estimate the measurement uncertainty contribution of each step in the overall method by adding quality control spikes prior to each step. Addition of an internal standard during extraction normalized the sample preparation step to 0% error contribution, and coefficients of variation (CVs) were 6-7% for the analytical steps (LC and GC) and 6-9% for the sample processing techniques. In practice, overall CVs averaged 9-11% among the different analytes, commodities, batches, test portion weights, and analytical and sample processing methods.

29370262,"Currently, huanglongbing is the most damaging disease of citrus causing huge economic losses. The disease is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas). The pathogen is transmitted in a persistent propagative circulative manner within its vector, the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri. Exploring the metabolic alteration in the vector may lead to a better understanding of the nutritional needs of CLas and to designing an artificial medium for culturing the pathogen. It has been shown that the nymphal stages have a greater role in transmission mainly because they feed on plants more actively than adults. In this study, we carried out an untargeted comparative metabolomic analysis for healthy and CLas-infected 4th / 5th instar nymphs. The metabolic analysis was performed using trimethylsilylation and methyl chloroformate derivatization followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Overall, the changes in the nymph metabolism due to the infection with CLas were more pronounced than in adults, as we previously published. Nymphs reared on CLas-infected Valencia sweet orange were higher in many metabolites, mainly those of the TCA cycle, C16 and C18 fatty acids, glucose, sucrose, L-proline, L-serine, pyroglutamic acid, saccharic acid, threonic acid and myo-inositol than those reared on healthy plants. In contrast, CLas-infected nymphs were lower in putrescine, glycine, L -phenylalanine, L -tyrosine, L -valine, and chiro-inositol.

However, an imbalance of sulfite in vivo would lead to oxidative stress or age-related diseases, and an effective strategy for real-time imaging of cysteine metabolism in living cells is still lacking due to its low metabolite concentration and rapid reaction kinetics. Herein, a cyanine moiety based ratiometric fluorescence probe was developed for highly selective and sensitive detection of sulfite in aqueous solution and living cells. The free probe exhibited an orange emission color, and the fluorescence color would gradually change to blue once sulfite anions selectively reacted with the unsaturated carbon double bonds in the probe molecule. This ratiometric fluorescence manner endowed the probe excellent sensitivity with a detection limit of 0.78 nM, which was then explored to image the kinetic process of sulfite release in hepatic BRL cells after incubating with an excess amount of cysteine.

29238032,"Shimatogarashi (Capsicum frutescens) is a typical chili pepper domesticated in southern Japan. Important traits of Shimatogarashi peppers, such as color; proportion of organic acids, capsaicinoids, and aromatic compounds; and antioxidant activity in three stages of maturity (green (immature), orange (turning), and red (mature) stages) were characterized. The results indicated that the concentration of organic acids, including ascorbic, citric, and malic acid, increased during ripening. In addition, the amount of capsaicinoids, which are responsible for the pungent taste of chili peppers, increased as the fruit matured to the orange and red stages. The volatile compound profile of Shimatogarashi was dominated by the presence of esters, which mainly contributed to fruity notes. The total amount of volatile compounds analyzed by gas chromatography-headspace solid-phase microextraction (GC-HS-SPME), especially esters, decreased as the fruit changed in color from green to red. This was in contrast to the amount of terpenoids, especially limonene, which increased at the red stage, denoting a change in flavor from fruity to a more citrus-like aroma. Based on the total phenolic content (TPC), the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical method, the antioxidant capacity of Shimatogarashi showed an increase at the mature red stage.

29022832,"This study describes a novel electrochemical method to determine the herbicide trifluralin in samples of water, fruit juice, and vegetable extracts in the presence of surfactants, using a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). In acidic media, trifluralin was irreversible on the glassy carbon electrode surface at -0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Surfactant presence on the electrode-solution interface modified current intensities and shifted the reduction peak potential of trifluralin. Different types of surfactant and their concentrations were investigated. The anionic surfactant significantly enhanced the peak current intensity of trifluralin. Under optimal analytical conditions, an analytical curve was obtained in the concentration range of 0.48-32.20 µM. The limits of detection and quantification were estimated at 0.031 and 0.104 µM, respectively. The method was successfully applied to quantify trifluralin in samples of water, orange and tomato juice, and green pepper, carrot, and onion extracts, with recovery rates of 97.9-102.1%. The results were in good agreement with those obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography, indicating that the proposed electrochemical method can be employed to quantify trifluralin in various types foods, with sensitivity, specificity, selectivity and reproducibility.","Journal of environmental science and health.

In this study, the effects of preheating temperature (30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 °C) and storage temperature (4, 25, and 37 °C) on aroma profiles and physical properties of three citrus-oil (i.e., mandarin, sweet orange, and bergamot oils) emulsions were systematically investigated for the first time. The results demonstrated the significant impact of temperature on aroma profile and physical properties. The abundance of d-limonene was found to be the main factor determining the aroma of the three citrus-oil emulsions at different preheating and storage temperatures, while β-linalool and linalyl acetate were important for the aroma of bergamot oil emulsion. Preheating temperature showed a profound impact on the aroma of citrus-oil emulsions, and the aroma of different citrus oil emulsions showed different sensitivity to preheating temperature. Storage temperature was also able to alter the properties of citrus oil emulsions. The higher was the storage temperature, the more alteration of aroma and more instability of the emulsions there was, which could be attributed to the alteration of the oil components and the properties of emulsions.

28786013,"Dyes containing one or more azo linkages are widely applied in cosmetics, tattooing, food and drinks, pharmaceuticals, printing inks, plastics, leather, as well as paper industries. Previously we reported that bacteria living on human skin have the ability to reduce some azo dyes to aromatic amines, which raises potential safety concerns regarding human dermal exposure to azo dyes such as those in tattoo ink and cosmetic colorant formulations. To comprehensively investigate azo dye-induced toxicity by skin bacteria activation, it is very critical to understand the mechanism of metabolism of the azo dyes at the systems biology level. In this study, an LC/MS-based metabolomics approach was employed to globally investigate metabolism of azo dyes by Staphylococcus aureus as well as their effects on the metabolome of the bacterium. Growth of S. aureus in the presence of Sudan III or Orange II was not affected during the incubation period. Metabolomics results showed that Sudan III was metabolized to 4-(phenyldiazenyl) aniline (48%), 1-[(4-aminophenyl) diazenyl]-2-naphthol (4%) and eicosenoic acid Sudan III (0.9%). These findings indicated that the azo bond close to naphthalene group of Sudan III was preferentially cleaved compared with the other azo bond. The metabolite from Orange II was identified as 4-aminobenzene sulfonic acid (35%). A much higher amount of Orange II (~90×) was detected in the cell pellets from the active viable cells compared with those from boiled cells incubated with the same concentration of Orange II. This finding suggests that Orange II was primarily transported into the S. aureus cells for metabolism, instead of the theory that the azo dye metabolism occurs extracellularly. In addition, the metabolomics results showed that Sudan III affected energy pathways of the S. aureus cells, while Orange II had less noticeable effects on the cells. In summary, this study provided novel information regarding azo dye metabolism by the skin bacterium, the effects of azo dyes on the bacterial cells and the important role on the toxicity and/or inactivation of these compounds due to microbial metabolism.",Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,"['D000814', 'D001391', 'D001557', 'D003116', 'D055442', 'D009284', 'D013211', 'D013425', 'D053719']","['Aniline Compounds', 'Azo Compounds', 'Benzenesulfonates', 'Color', 'Metabolome', 'Naphthols', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Sulfanilic Acids', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Evaluation of metabolism of azo dyes and their effects on Staphylococcus aureus metabolome.,"['Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None]","['chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28786013,2018

In addition, within the significantly associated genomic region, candidate genes were identified using marker sequences to search the draft genome of Yesso scallop. Three genes (LDLR, FRIS, and FRIY) with known functions in carotenoid metabolism were identified. Further study using high-performance liquid chromatography proved that the relative level of carotenoids in the reddish-orange shells was 40 times higher than that in the brown shells. These results suggested that the accumulation of carotenoids contributes to the formation of reddish-orange shells.","Marine biotechnology (New York, N.Y.)","['D060105', 'D000818', 'D017756', 'D002338', 'D003116', 'D055106', 'D049897', 'D020641', 'D017422']","['Animal Shells', 'Animals', 'Aquaculture', 'Carotenoids', 'Color', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Pectinidae', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']","A Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies the Genomic Region Associated with Shell Color in Yesso Scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis.","['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None]","['chemistry', None, None, 'genetics', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28527015,2018

The top 10 statistical features from two MVA approaches, partial least-squares data analysis (PLS-DA) and Random Forrest (RF), were purified to approximately 70% via multidimensional liquid chromatography-mass-directed fractionation to screen for sensory activity. When added to a 'fresh' orange flavor model system, 50-60% of the isolates were reported to cause a sensory change. From the subset of the actives identified, two compounds were selected, on the basis of statistical relevance, that were further purified to >97% for identification (MS, NMR) and for sensory descriptive analysis (DA). The compounds were identified as nomilin glucoside and a novel ionone glucoside.

We isolated the compound from a high-boiling fraction of an orange essential oil, and subsequent nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of the isolated compound identified it as rotundone. Mass spectra and retention indices obtained from aroma concentrates of grapefruit, apple, and mango were identical to those of rotundone, which was therefore determined to be the common woody compound in these fruits. Sensory analyses were performed to assess the effects of rotundone on model beverages of the various fruits.

For this purpose, the anti-AME monoclonal antibody (mAb) was prepared and identified. AME coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) via methyl 4-bromobutanoate was prepared as immunogen. The recoveries of AME in spiked cherry and orange fruits determined by competitive ELISA were 86.1% and 80.7%, respectively. A colloidal gold nanoparticle (CGN) and CGNs-mAb conjugate were synthesized, and on this basis, a competitive colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip was developed and applied to the detection of AME toxin in fruit samples. The intensity of red density of the test line (T line) is inversely proportional to AME concentration in the range 0.1-10 ng/mL. The visual limit of detection (LOD) of AME was found to be about 10 ng/mL. The semi-quantitative detection can be completed in 10 min. Moreover, the immunochromatographic strip has lower cross-reactivity with AME analogues, and it has a good stability performance (following 3 months of storage).

28434710,"In the last 10 years, the majority of the pesticide food control laboratories moved from GC-MS to GC-MS/MS as the preferred analytical technique to address GC amenable compounds. The main reason for this change was the negative impact on the single stage GC-MS analysis caused by the interference from coeluting matrix compounds. The new development of gas chromatography coupled to high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (GC-HRAMS) provides opportunities to overcome such matrix interferences as a result of its much higher selectivity; allowing laboratories to carry out full-scan analysis covering the most exigent analytical performance criteria. The aim of this work is the evaluation of the main analytical performance parameters for the multiresidue screening of pesticide residues by a gas chromatography-Orbitrap™ mass spectrometer in fruits and vegetables. Electron ionization and full-scan high resolution mass spectrometry was selected for this evaluation. Mass resolving power, selectivity, sensitivity, analyte identification and database generation are discussed in light of the analysis of various commodities and a large scope of pesticides. The selected operational conditions provided optimal mass accuracy, within ±1mDa and achieved LOQs of 10μg/kg or lower for practically all the selected pesticides and commodities. Applicability for quantitative residue analysis was verified by the validation of the 210 pesticides in four matrices (tomato, apple, leek and orange).

Colorimetry was used to measure L*, a*, and b* values, hue angle, and change in color (ΔE). Concentrations of individual diglucosides decreased more slowly than monoglucosides. When monoglucosides and diglucosides were combined, the reaction rate of monoglucosides was slower than that of monoglucosides alone.

In this study, an effective artificial neural network (ANN) method is designed for modeling multicomponent absorbance data with the presence of shifts or changes of peak shapes in spectroscopic analysis. Gradient descent methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt function are usually used to determine the parameters of ANN. However, these methods may provide inappropriate parameters. In this paper, we propose combination of genetic algorithms (GA) and partial swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize parameters of ANN, and then the algorithm is used to process the relationship between the absorbance data and the concentration of analytes. The hybrid algorithm has the benefits of both PSO and GA techniques. The performance of this algorithm is compared to the performance of PSO-ANN, PC-ANN and ANN based Levenberg-Marquardt function. The obtained results revealed that the designed model can accurately determine colorant concentrations in real and synthetic samples.

27755556,"Muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE) is derived from muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia), a common red grape used to produce red wine. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) that serves as a survival mechanism to relieve ER stress and restore ER homeostasis. However, when persistent, ER stress can alter the cytoprotective functions of the UPR to promote autophagy and cell death. Although MSKE has been documented to induce apoptosis, it has not been linked to ER stress/UPR/autophagy. We hypothesized that MSKE may induce a severe ER stress response-mediated autophagy leading to apoptosis. As a model, we treated C4-2 prostate cancer cells with MSKE and performed a quantitative Tandem Mass Tag Isobaric Labeling proteomic analysis. ER stress response, autophagy and apoptosis were analyzed by western blot, acridine orange and TUNEL/Annexin V staining, respectively. Quantitative proteomics analysis indicated that ER stress response proteins, such as GRP78 were greatly elevated following treatment with MSKE. The up-regulation of pro-apoptotic markers PARP, caspase-12, cleaved caspase-3, -7, BAX and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic marker BCL2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis and apoptosis was visualized by increased TUNEL/Annexin V staining upon MSKE treatment. Moreover, increased acridine orange, and LC3B staining was detected in MSKE-treated cells, suggesting an ER stress/autophagy response. Finally, MSKE-mediated autophagy and apoptosis was antagonized by co-treatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor.

Transgenic oranges engineered for alterations in the presence or concentration of few related chemical groups enable asking precise questions about their contribution to overall odor, either positive or negative, as perceived by the human nose. Here, either down- or up-regulation of a d-limonene synthase allowed us to infer that a decrease of as much as 51 times in d-limonene and an increase of as much as 3.2 times in linalool in juice were neutral for odor perception while an increase of only 3 times in ethyl esters stimulated the preference of 66% of the judges.

27619377,"The analysis of pesticides in food products requires accurate measurements for which standardised protocols have been developed. This paper reports the validation of QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe)-based methods applied to three different food samples (brown rice, red pepper and mandarin orange) analysed using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The validation of the analytical methods used to measure 113 pesticides, including various insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, was conducted in three food matrices and at three spiking levels by three different laboratories. The set of validated results was interpreted, statistically analysed and visualised using principal component analysis (PCA). Notably, the matrix effects in GC-MS analysis for most of the tested pesticides from different matrices were lowered to practical values (less than 30%) appropriate for routine analysis. This allowed for the quantification of pesticides in the samples using standard and analyte protectants (APs) in the reagent method blank as a screening measure, providing an alternative to matrix-matched calibration. Alternatively, the use of only one standardised calibration (grape matrix) in combination with APs also allowed for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of pesticides in different matrices. The inclusion of APs reduced the differences in the matrix-induced enhancement effects of various samples. The use of an internal standard (IS) to correct the matrix effects was also noted. The normalisation of the analyte peak with triphenyl phosphate (TPP) as an IS resulted in a slight improvement of validation values such as precision and linearity in only one laboratory, but it lowered the value of matrix effects in all three laboratories.","Food additives & contaminants.

27428755,"A sensitive and reliable method for the simultaneous determination of hydroxycoumarin-type (brodifacoum, bromadiolone, coumatetralyl, and warfarin) and indandione-type (chlorophacinone, diphacinone, and pindone) rodenticides in agricultural products by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed. The procedure involved extraction of the rodenticides from samples with acetone, followed by liquid-liquid partitioning with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and 10% sodium chloride aqueous solution, then cleanup using GPC, and finally, analysis using LC-MS/MS. High recoveries from the GPC column were obtained for all rodenticides tested using a mobile phase of acetone/cyclohexane/triethylamine (400:1600:1, v/v/v). An ODS column, which contains low levels of metal impurities, gave satisfactory peak shapes for both hydroxycoumarin- and indandione-type rodenticides in the LC-MS/MS separation. The average recoveries of rodenticides from eight agricultural foods (apple, eggplant, cabbage, orange, potato, tomato, brown rice, and soybean) fortified at 0.0005-0.001 mg/kg ranged from 76 to 116%, except for bromadiolone in orange (53%) and diphacinone in soybean (54%), and the relative standard deviations ranged from 1 to 16%. The proposed method effectively removed interfering components, such as pigments and lipids, and showed high selectivity. In addition, the matrix effects were negligible for most of the rodenticide/food combinations. The results suggest that the proposed method is reliable and suitable for determining hydroxycoumarin- and indandione-type rodenticides in agricultural products.

27146949,"The aim of this study was the optimisation of a multi-analyte method for the analysis of primary aromatic amines (PAAs) from napkins in order to support official controls and food safety. We developed a UHPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of 36 toxicologically relevant PAAs for paper and board. Good regression coefficients of the calibration curves in a range of 0.992-0.999 and reproducibilities in a range of 2.3-15% were obtained. Limits of detections (LODs) were in the range of 0.03-1.4 µg l(-1) and recoveries were in a range of 21-110% for all the amines. A total of 93 coloured paper napkin samples from different European countries were bought and extracted with water to determine the PAAs. The results showed that 42 of 93 samples contained at least one PAA. More than half of the detected PAAs are considered as toxic, carcinogenic or probably carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), or are classified as such in the European Union legislation on chemicals. Summed concentrations of PAAs in seven samples were higher than 10 µg l(-1), the limit of summed PAA in the European Union plastic food contact material regulation. Also, eight PAAs, classified as Category 1A and 1B carcinogen in the European Union legislation of chemicals, were detected at concentrations higher than 2 µg l(-1), exceeding the limit proposed by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany. Aniline (n = 14) was most frequently present in higher concentrations followed by o-toluidine, o-anisidine, 2,4-dimethylaniline and 4-aminoazobenzene. Red, orange, yellow and multicoloured paper napkins contained the highest concentrations of total PAAs (> 10 µg l(-1)). Although the European Union has not harmonised the legislation of paper and board materials and, thus, there is no specific migration limit for PAAs from paper napkins, the present study showed that coloured paper napkins can contain toxic and carcinogenic PAAs at concentrations that are relevant for monitoring.

Low limits of detection (S/N = 3) and quantification limits (S/N = 10) of the proposed method for the target analytes were achieved within the range of 0.012-0.23 μg/L and 0.039-0.42 μg/L, respectively. The precision of the proposed method was evaluated in terms of intra- and inter-assay variability calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), and it was found that the values were all below 10%. Finally, the proposed method was used to detect preservatives in different orange juice and tea drink samples successfully. The recoveries were in the range of 71.9-116%, and the RSDs were below 10% in the all cases.

26982966,"A push-pull N-methylpyridinium fluorescent dye with a pyrenyl group as the electron-donor portion was investigated within the nano-heterogeneous media provided by some micellar systems. The molecule was studied by stationary and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques in spherical micellar solutions and viscoelastic hydrogels, in order to throw light on the role played by twisting in its excited state deactivation. As proven by femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion and transient absorption experiments, the excited state dynamics of the molecule is ruled by charge transfer and twisting processes, which, from the locally excited (LE) state initially populated upon excitation, progressively lead to twisted (TICT) and planar (PICT) intramolecular charge transfer states. The inclusion within micellar aggregates was found to slow down and/or limit the rotation of the molecule with respect to what had previously been observed in water, while its confinement within the hydrophobic domains of the gel matrixes prevents any molecular torsion. The increasing viscosity of the medium, when passing from water to micellar systems, implies that the detected steady-state fluorescence comes from an excited state which is not fully relaxed, as is the case with the TICT state in micelles or the LE state in hydrogels, where the detected emission changes its usual orange colour to yellow.

26946008,"Pyrethroid insecticides are used extensively in agriculture, and they, as well as their environmental degradates, may remain as residues on foods such as fruits and vegetables. Since pyrethroid degradates can be identical to the urinary markers used in human biomonitoring, it is important to understand the contribution of these degradates when studying sources of human pyrethroid exposure. We modified the widely used Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe (QuEChERS) method to measure several current-use pyrethroids (cis/trans-permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and cyhalothrin) and their environmental degradation products (3-PBA, cis/trans-DCCA, 4-F-3-PBA, DBCA, and MPA) in selected fresh fruits and vegetables. Using fortified samples, we determined extraction efficiencies from: tomatoes, oranges (whole, peeled, and rind), grapes, apples, bananas (peeled and rind only), onions, lettuce, green peppers, carrots and broccoli. For a subset of these food items (apples, grapes, tomatoes, lettuce and banana peel), we also established limits of detection (MDLs) and quantitation (MQLs). Each sample was homogenized (1kg) then spiked with the target pyrethroids and their degradation products. Sub-samples (15g) were extracted with acetonitrile, then salted out and partitioned with NaCl and MgSO4. The extract was divided and further cleaned using solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges containing either graphitized non-porous carbon (pyrethroids) or C18 (degradation products). Sample analysis was via liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Considering the mean recoveries each of the 14 analytes in all 13 matrices: 42% of the recoveries were ≥90%, 70% were ≥80%, and 90% were ≥70%. All MDL's were less than 100ng/kg, except 3-PBA (132ng/kg, tomato), MPA (129ng/kg, tomato), and trans-permethrin (141ng/kg, banana peel). We then applied the method to non-spiked samples (subset of 5 for which the MDLs/MQLs had been determined) collected weekly for four weeks from local supermarkets. At least one pyrethroid was present in measureable concentrations in all matrices except banana peels. In contrast, the only degradation products detected were cis/trans-DCCA, in one lettuce sample.

26938581,"The ability to identify contaminants or adulterants in diverse, complex sample matrixes is necessary in food safety. Thus, nontargeted screening approaches must be implemented to detect and identify unexpected, unknown hazardous compounds that may be present. Molecular formulas can be generated for detected compounds from high-resolution mass spectrometry data, but analysis can be lengthy when thousands of compounds are detected in a single sample. Efficient data mining methods to analyze these complex data sets are necessary given the inherent chemical diversity and variability of food matrixes. The aim of this work is to determine necessary requirements to successfully apply data analysis strategies to distinguish suspect and control samples. Infant formula and orange juice samples were analyzed with one lot of each matrix containing varying concentrations of a four compound mixture to represent a suspect sample set. Small molecular differences were parsed from the data, where analytes as low as 10 ppb were revealed. This was accomplished, in part, by analyzing a quality control standard, matrix spiked with an analytical standard mixture, technical replicates, a representative number of sample lots, and blanks within the sample sequence; this enabled the development of a data analysis workflow and ensured that the employed method is sufficient for mining relevant molecular features from the data.

26921809,"Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) plays a unique role in protecting many cyanobacteria from light-induced damage. The active form of OCP is directly involved in energy dissipation by binding to the phycobilisome (PBS), the major light-harvesting complex in cyanobacteria. There are two structural modules in OCP, an N-terminal domain (NTD), and a C-terminal domain (CTD), which play different functional roles during the OCP-PBS quenching cycle. Because of the quasi-stable nature of active OCP, structural analysis of active OCP has been lacking compared to its inactive form. In this report, partial proteolysis was used to generate two structural domains, NTD and CTD, from active OCP. We used multiple native mass spectrometry (MS) based approaches to interrogate the structural features of the NTD and the CTD. Collisional activation and ion mobility analysis indicated that the NTD releases its bound carotenoid without forming any intermediates and the CTD is resistant to unfolding upon collisional energy ramping. The unfolding intermediates observed in inactive intact OCP suggest that it is the N-terminal extension and the NTD-CTD loop that lead to the observed unfolding intermediates. These combined approaches extend the knowledge of OCP photo-activation and structural features of OCP functional domains. Combining native MS, ion mobility, and collisional activation promises to be a sensitive new approach for studies of photosynthetic protein-pigment complexes.

The main factors affecting the extraction of analysts, such as pH, surfactant and adsorbent concentrations and zeta potential were studied and optimized. Under optimized conditions, the proposed method was successful applied for the analysis of banned cationic dyes in food samples such as chili sauce, soybean paste and tomato sauce.

The method limits of determination/quantification were in the range of 0.2-0.9 and 0.7-3μgkg(-1), respectively. The selective adsorption and enrichment of cationic dyes were achieved by the synergistic effects of hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic attraction between mixed hemimicelles and the cationic dyes, which also resulted in the removal of natural pigments interferences from sample extracts. When applied to real samples, RB was detected in several positive samples (chili powders) within the range from 0.042 to 0.177mgkg(-1).

We examined the extent and dietary predictors of exposure to inorganic arsenic in 5-8 year old children from Montevideo, Uruguay. Children were recruited at school; 357 were enrolled, 328 collected morning urine samples, and 317 had two 24-h dietary recalls. Urinary arsenic metabolites, i.e. inorganic arsenic (iAs), methylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with hydride generation and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-HG-ICP-MS), and the sum concentration (U-As) used for exposure assessment. Proportions of arsenic metabolites (%iAs, %MMA and %DMA) in urine were modelled in OLS regressions as functions of food groups, dietary patterns, nutrient intake, and nutritional status. Exposure to arsenic was low (median U-As: 9.9µg/L) and household water (water As: median 0.45µg/L) was not a major contributor to exposure. Children with higher consumption of rice had higher U-As but lower %iAs, %MMA, and higher %DMA. Children with higher meat consumption had lower %iAs and higher %DMA. Higher scores on ""nutrient dense"" dietary pattern were related to lower %iAs and %MMA, and higher %DMA. Higher intake of dietary folate was associated with lower %MMA and higher %DMA. Overweight children had lower %MMA and higher %DMA than normal-weight children. In summary, rice was an important predictor of exposure to inorganic arsenic and DMA.

By comparative evaluation among six various adsorbents (C18, PSA, HLB, MCX, Silica, NH2), the combination of MCX and NH2 was found to provide the most effective cleanup, removing the greatest number of matrix interferences and also allowing the quantification of all analyzed mycotoxins in fruits. The optimized extraction conditions including acidified aqueous acetonitrile and an additional salt-out step using NaCl were employed before SPE cleanup. Method validation was performed by analyzing samples spiked at three levels (LOQ, 2 LOQ and 10 LOQ). Four fruits including apple, sweet cherry, tomato and orange fruits were selected, and accuracy (recovery%), precision (RSD%), limits of quantification (LOQ), linearity and matrix effect were evaluated during validation.

Instead of analysis in the traditionally used negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mode, these anionic compounds were detected in positive ESI with the use of ion-pairing reagents. In this approach, only a small amount (60µM) of a commercially available dicationic ion-pairing reagent was introduced into the post-column sample stream. This method has been validated in six different types of RACs including corn grain, corn stover, cotton seed, soybean, soy forage and orange with satisfactory quantitative accuracy and precision.

Firstly, the navel orange samples were contaminated in our lab. The spectra of samples were collected by irradiating the peel by optimized LIBS parameters. The laser energy was set as 20 mJ, delay time of Spectral Data Gathering was set as 1.2 micros, the integration time of Spectral data gathering was set as 2 ms. The real concentration in samples was obtained by AAS (atom absorption spectroscopy). The characteristic variables Cu I 324.7 and Cu I 327.4 were extracted. And the calibration model was constructed between LIBS spectra and real concentration about Cu. The results show that relative error of the predicted concentrations of three relational model were 7.01% or less, reached a minimum of 0.02%, 0.01% and 0.02% respectively. The average relative errors were 2.33%, 3.10% and 26.3%. Tests showed that different characteristic variables decided different accuracy.

By using calibration standards in cucumber matrix, recovery and precision were calculated in lettuce, orange and wheat for 109 pesticides at 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) in two sets of samples: one with and one without clean-up. For both spiking levels, 80-82% of the pesticides in the non-cleaned extracts and 80-84% of the pesticides in the cleaned extracts were within the acceptable recovery range of 70-120%. Precision data for both levels showed that 95% of the pesticides in the non-cleaned extracts and 93-95% of the pesticides in the cleaned extracts had RSDs below 20%. Recovery and precision data were determined using a two tailed t-test (p = 0.05). By using calibration standards in the respective matrix, we studied if the non-cleaned calibration standards gave an extra matrix effect compared with the cleaned standards by using the slope from calibration graphs and plotting the calculated extra matrix effect minus 100 for each compound. The results showed that for 79% of the pesticides, the extra matrix effect minus 100 was within the acceptable range of -20% to 20%. Five European Union proficiency tests on rye, mandarin, rice, pear and barley, respectively, from 2010 to 2012 were reanalysed omitting the clean-up step and showed satisfactory results. At least 70 injections of non-cleaned extracts were made without detecting any increased need for maintenance during the experimental period. Analysing non-cleaned QuEChERS extracts of lettuce, orange and wheat are possible under the conditions described in this paper because recovery, precision and specificity showed satisfactory results compared with samples subjected to traditional dispersive clean-up.

Besides their contents in foods, their bioaccessibility is of great interest since it represents the amount that will be absorbed in the gut. The aim of this study was to adopt, for the first time, the in vitro digestion model suitable for food, proposed in a consensus paper by Minekus et al. (2014), to assess the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from the fruits that are the major contributors to the intake of β-cryptoxanthin in Spain (orange, tangerine, red pepper, peach, watermelon, and persimmon) and loquat. The highest β-cryptoxanthin content and the lowest bioaccessibility was found in mandarin and loquat (13331.6 and 929.2 μg per 100 g respectively), whereas the highest contents of β-carotene and α-carotene were recorded in red pepper (1135.3 and 90.4 μg per 100 g respectively). The bioaccessibility of β-cryptoxanthin was similar to that of β-carotene (0.02-9.8% and 1-9.1%, respectively) and was higher than that of β-carotene in red pepper, watermelon and peach. α-Carotene bioaccessibility ranged between 0% and 4.6%. We discuss the critical factors for comparing our data: the form of the food being analyzed (raw/cooked/previously frozen, in the presence or absence of oil/fat) and the protocol for bioaccessibility assessment. Different food processing techniques may increase carotenoid bioaccessibility compared to raw food.

So there are strict rules on the dosage of sodium methylparaben in every country. The fluorescence spectral properties of sodium methylparaben in aqueous solution and orange juice solution are analyzed with FS920 fluorescence spectrometer. The research result shows that the fluorescence characteristic peak of sodium methylparaben solution is in λ(ex)/λ(em) = 380/5 10 nm, while sodium methylparaben orange juice solution has two fluorescence characteristic peaks which are in λ(ex)/λ(em) = 440/520 nm and 470/530 nm, and its best excitation wavelength is 440 nm. So it can be concluded from the result that there is a significant change between the characteristic peaks of sodium methylparaben in the two solution. Compared with the fluorescence characteristic peak of sodium methylparaben solution, thoses of sodium methylparaben orange juice solution are changed significantly, which are caused by the interference of orange juice fluorescence characteristics. In order to determine the content of sodium methylparaben in the fresh orange juice, a detection model of sodium methylparaben content in orange juice is built based on GA-BP neural network, according to the relationship between fluorescence intensity in λ(ex) = 440 nm and the content of sodium methylparaben orange juice solution.

The first method is based on the reaction of the drug with p-chloranilic acid (p-CA) in acetone to give a purple colored product with maximum absorbance at 524nm. The second method depends on the reaction of VP with dichlone (DC) in dimethylformamide forming a reddish orange product measured at 490nm. The third method is based upon the interaction of VP and picric acid (PA) in chloroform resulting in the formation of a yellow complex measured at 415nm. The fourth method involves the formation of a yellow complex peaking at 361nm upon the reaction of the drug with iodine in chloroform. Experimental conditions affecting the color development were studied and optimized. Stoichiometry of the reactions was determined. The proposed spectrophotometric procedures were effectively validated with respect to linearity, ranges, precision, accuracy, specificity, robustness, detection and quantification limits. Calibration curves of the formed color products with p-CA, DC, PA and iodine showed good linear relationships over the concentration ranges 24-144, 40-200, 2-20 and 1-8μg/mL respectively.

As some aroma components or some flavor molecules interacted with the whole juice matrix, the changes of most components in the fruit juice were not in proportion to the mixing ratio of the 2 citrus fruits. The potential correlations among the signals of E-tongue and E-nose, volatile components, and sensory attributes were analyzed by using analysis of variance partial least squares regression. The result showed that the variables from the sensor signals (E-tongue system and E-nose system) had significant and positive (or negative) correlations to the most variables of volatile components (GC-MS) and sensory attributes (QDA). The simultaneous utilization of E-tongue and E-nose obtained a perfect classification result with 100% accuracy rate based on linear discriminant analysis and also attained a satisfying prediction with high coefficient association for the sensory attributes (R(2) > 0.994 for training sets and R(2) > 0.983 for testing sets) and for the volatile components (R(2) > 0.992 for training sets and R(2) > 0.990 for testing sets) based on random forest.

Besides the risk for natural contamination of seafood and drinking water, PSTs also pose potent threats through intentional contamination of food, due to their high toxicity and the wide distributions of toxin-producing algae. The new preparation method aim to maintain the samples' original toxin profiles by avoiding conditions known to induce interconversion or degradation of the PSTs. The method was evaluated for PST extraction from water, milk, orange juice, apple purée, baby food, and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). The extracts were found to produce reproducible retention times in HILIC-MS/MS analysis. When an authentic toxic mussel sample was analyzed using the novel method, saxitoxin and gonyautoxin-3 were identified, in agreement with data acquired using the Lawrence pre-column oxidation high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) method.

Mercury was determined using validated method by cold-vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy after direct sample matrix combustion. A large set of data gained using 371 fruiting bodies and 204 soil samples revealed the susceptibility of L. versipelle to Hg contamination and permitted the estimation of probable intake of Hg contaminant by consumers foraging for this species. The range of median values of Hg determined in caps of L. versipelle was from 0.20 to 2.0 mg kg(-1) dry biomass, and the median for 19 localities was 0.65 mg kg(-1) dry biomass. The values of the Hg bioconcentration factor (BCF) determined for L. versipelle correlated negatively with Hg contents. Mercury in topsoil beneath L. versipelle ranged from 0.019 to 0.041 mg kg(-1) dry matter for less-contaminated locations (BCF of 17 to 65 for caps) and from 0.076 to 0.39 mg kg(-1) dry matter for more contaminated locations (BCF of 1.9 to 22). Fruiting bodies of L. versipelle collected in some regions of Poland if consumed in amount of 300 g in one meal in a week could provide Hg doses above the provisionally tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) value of 0.004 mg Hg kg(-1) body mass, while regular consumptions for most of the locations were below the limit even with more frequent consumption.

26301946,"A method based on QuEChERS extraction and LC-quadrupole-Orbitrap™ MS detection was established utilising an improved fully non-targeted way of data acquisition with and without fragmentation. A full-scan acquisition event without fragmentation (resolving power 70,000) was followed by five consecutive fragmentation events (variable data independent acquisition - vDIA; resolving power 35,000) where all ions from the full-scan range are fragmented. Compared with fragmentation in a single event (all-ion fragmentation - AIF), this improves both selectivity and sensitivity for the fragment ions, which is beneficial for screening performance and identification capability. The method was validated, using the data from the same measurements, for two types of analysis: quantitation/identification and qualitative screening. The quantitative validation, performed according to the guidelines in SANCO/12571/2013, tested the performance of the method for 184 compounds in lettuce and orange at two spiking levels: 10 and 50 ng g(-1). The validation showed that the vast majority of the compounds met the criteria for trueness and precision set in the SANCO guidance document. In the qualitative validation the same 184 compounds were used to test the untargeted screening capabilities of the method. In this validation the compounds were spiked at three levels into 11 different fruit and vegetable matrices, which were measured twice on separate days. Taking all data from the qualitative validation together, an overall detection rate of 92% was achieved at the 10 ng g(-1) level, increasing to 98% at 200 ng g(-1). A screening detection limit (as defined in the SANCO guidelines) of 10 ng g(-1) could be achieved for 134 compounds. For 39 and two pesticides the SDL was 50 and 200 ng g(-1), respectively. For the other nine compounds no SDL could be established. The identification (ion ratio) criteria as recommended in the SANCO document could be met for 93% of the detected pesticide/matrix/concentration combinations. The outcome of both validations shows that the described method can be used to combine quantitative analysis and the identification of frequently detected pesticides (so far typically done using triple quadrupole MS/MS) with a qualitative screening to be used for a wide range of less frequent detected compounds in one measurement.","Food additives & contaminants.

A series of experiments were investigated to achieve the most favorable conditions (including extraction solvent: 77μL of 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate; sample pH 6.3, without salt addition; and extraction cycles: 25 during 100s of sonication) using a central composite design strategy.

The results showed that -as well as its simplicity, fastness, and use of no hazardous disperser and extraction solvents- OS-AALLME is an enough sensitive and efficient method for the extraction of these dyes from complex matrices.

Four French cider apple juices were produced in conditions similar to those used in the cider-making industry. The oxidized juices, characterized using the CIE L a b parameters, displayed various colors depending on the apple variety and native phenolic composition. HPLC-DAD-MS revealed contrasting pigment profiles related to oxidized tanning and nontanning molecules. The latter were divided into two groups according to their polarity and their visible spectra. With regard to phenolic classes, flavanol monomers and hydroxycinnamic acids played an essential role in the formation of oxidation products. Interestingly, dihydrochalcones appeared to include precursors of some yellow compounds. Indeed, the yellow pigment phloretin xyloglucoside oxidation product (PXGOPj), derived from phloretin xyloglucoside, was clearly identified in apple juices as a xyloglucose analogue of the yellow pigment phloridzin oxidation product (POPj), previously characterized in a model solution by Le Guernevé et al.

25973609,"Stable isotope analysis of animal tissues allows description of isotopic niches, whose axes in an n-dimensional space are the isotopic ratios, compared to a standard, of different isotope systems (e.g. δ(13)C, δ(15)N). Isotopic niches are informative about where an animal, population or species lives and about what it consumes. Here we describe inter- and intrapopulation isotopic niche (bidimensional δ(13)C-δ(15)N space) of the Orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra), an arthropodivorous small lizard, in ten localities of Baja California Sur (Mexico). These localities range from extreme arid to subtropical conditions. Between 13 and 20 individuals were sampled at each locality and 1 cm of tail-tip was collected for isotope analysis. As expected, interpopulation niche width variation was much larger than intrapopulation one. Besides, isotopic variation was not related to age, sex or individual size of lizards. This suggests geographic variation of the isotopic niche was related to changes in the basal resources that fuel the trophic web at each locality. The position of Bayesian isotope ellipses in the δ-space indicated that whiptails in more arid localities were enriched in 13C, suggesting most of the carbon they ingested came from CAM succulent plants (cacti, agaves) and in minor degree in C4 grasses. Contrarily, whiptails in subtropical areas were depleted in 13C, as they received more carbon from C3 scrubs and trees. Localities closer to sea-level tended to be enriched in 15N, but a clear influence of marine subsidies was detected only at individual level.

25966375,"In this paper, we have presented a novel CdTe quantum dots (QDs) based fluorescent sensor for visual and turn-on sensing of citrate in human urine samples. The europium ion (Eu(3+)) can lead to the fluorescence quenching of thioglycollic acid (TGA) modified CdTe QDs due to photoinduced electron transfer accompanied by the change of emission color from yellow to orange. Next, addition of citrate breaks the preformed assembly because citrate can replace the CdTe QDs, based on the fact that the Eu(3+) ion displays higher affinity with citrate than the CdTe QDs. Thus the photoinduced electron transfer is switched off, and the fluorescence emission of CdTe QDs is rapidly (within 5min) recovered, simultaneously, the orange emission color restores to yellow. Such proposed strategy may conveniently discriminate the patient of renal stone from normal person by naked eyes. In addition to visualization detection, the fluorescence responses can be used for well quantifying citrate in the range of 0.67-133μM.

The new approach is based on using label-free phages (T4), obligate parasites of bacteria, which are attractive for pathogen detection because of their inherent natural specificity and ease of use. A specific immunomagnetic separation was used to capture the progeny phages produced. Subsequently, T4 phage markers were detected by liquid chromatography coupled to targeted mass spectrometry. Combining the specificity of these three methodologies is of great interest in developing an alternative to conventional time-consuming culture-based technologies for the detection of viable bacteria for industrial applications. First, optimization experiments with phage T4 spiked in complex matrices (without a phage amplification event) were performed and demonstrated specific, sensitive, and reproducible phage capture and detection in complex matrices including Luria-Bertani broth, orange juice, and skimmed milk. The method developed was then applied to the detection of E. coli spiked in foodstuffs (with a phage amplification event). After having evaluated the impact of infection duration on assay sensitivity, we showed that our assay specifically detects viable E. coli in milk at an initial count of ≥1 colony-forming unit (cfu)/mL after an 8-h infection.

25781176,"Testis maturation, germ cell development and function of sperm, are related to lipid composition. Phosphatidylcholines (PCs) play a key role in the structure and function of testes. As well, increases of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), especially arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are essential for male fertility. This study is the first report to show the composition and distribution of PCs and total fatty acids (FAs) in three groups of seminiferous tubules (STs) classified by cellular associations [i.e., A (STs with mostly early germ cells), B (STs with mostly spermatids), and C (STs with spermatozoa)], in three morphotypes of Macrobrachium rosenbergii, [i.e., small male (SM), orange claw male (OC), and blue claw male (BC)]. Thin layer chromatography exhibited levels of PCs reaching maxima in STs of group B. Imaging mass spectrometry showed remarkably high signals corresponding to PC (16:0/18:1), PC (18:0/18:2), PC (18:2/20:5), and PC (16:0/22:6) in STs of groups A and B. Moreover, most signals were detected in the early developing cells and the intertubular area, but not at the area containing spermatozoa. Finally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated that the major FAs present in the testes were composed of 14:0, 16:0, 17:0, 18:0, 16:1, 18:1, 18:2, 20:1, 20:2, 20:4, 20:5, and 22:6. The testes of OC contained the greatest amounts of these FAs while the testes of BC contained the least amounts of these FAs, and there was more EPA (20:5) in the testes of SM and OC than those in the BC. The increasing amounts of FAs in the SM and OC indicate that they are important for spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. This knowledge will be useful in formulating diets containing PUFA and HUFA for prawn broodstocks in order to improve testis development, and lead to increased male fecundity.

The former two steps are much more important steps which have led to the destruction of the chromophores and the fading of the four original monascus red and orange pigments.

The advantages of soft ionization include enhanced molecular ions, reduced fragmentation, and reduced background noise as compared to electron ionization.

25559489,"Semiconductor colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have been applied in biological analysis due to their unique optical properties and their versatility to be conjugated to biomolecules, such as lectins and antibodies, acquiring specificity to label a variety of targets. Concanavalin A (Con A) lectin binds specifically to α-d-mannose and α-d-glucose regions of saccharides that are usually expressed on membranes of mammalian cells and on cell walls of microbials. Candida albicans is the most common fungal opportunistic pathogen present in humans. Therefore, in this work, this fungus was chosen as a model for understanding cells and biofilm-forming organisms. Here, we report an efficient bioconjugation process to bind CdTe (Cadmium Telluride) QDs to Con A, and applied the bioconjugates to label saccharide structures on the cellular surface of C. albicans suspensions and biofilms. By accomplishing hemagglutination experiments and circular dichroism, we observed that the Con A structure and biochemical properties were preserved after the bioconjugation. Fluorescence microscopy images of yeasts and hyphae cells, as well as biofilms, incubated with QDs-(Con A) showed a bright orange fluorescence profile, indicating that the cell walls were specifically labeled. Furthermore, flow cytometry measurements confirmed that over 93% of the yeast cells were successfully labeled by QD-(Con A) complex. In contrast, non-conjugated QDs or QDs-(inhibited Con A) do not label any kind of biological system tested, indicating that the bioconjugation was specific and efficient. The staining pattern of the cells and biofilms demonstrate that QDs were effectively bioconjugated to Con A with specific labeling of saccharide-rich structures on C. albicans. Consequently, this work opens new possibilities to monitor glucose and mannose molecules through fluorescence techniques, which can help to optimize phototherapy protocols for this kind of fungus.

25495653,"This manuscript reports a new pesticide residue analysis method employing a microflow-liquid chromatography system coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (microflow-LC-ESI-QqQ-MS). This uses an electrospray ionization source with a narrow tip emitter to generate smaller droplets. A validation study was undertaken to establish performance characteristics for this new approach on 90 pesticide residues, including their degradation products, in three commodities (tomato, pepper, and orange). The significant benefits of the microflow-LC-MS/MS-based method were a high sensitivity gain and a notable reduction in matrix effects delivered by a dilution of the sample (up to 30-fold); this is as a result of competition reduction between the matrix compounds and analytes for charge during ionization. Overall robustness and a capability to withstand long analytical runs using the microflow-LC-MS system have been demonstrated (for 100 consecutive injections without any maintenance being required). Quality controls based on the results of internal standards added at the samples' extraction, dilution, and injection steps were also satisfactory. The LOQ values were mostly 5 μg kg(-1) for almost all pesticide residues. Other benefits were a substantial reduction in solvent usage and waste disposal as well as a decrease in the run-time. The method was successfully applied in the routine analysis of 50 fruit and vegetable samples labeled as organically produced.

The extract was cleaned up on a C18 and graphite carbon black/PSA mini-cartridge column. Some pesticides gave tailing peaks, but these peaks became sharp and symmetrical when polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 was added to the test solution. Recovery tests were performed on nine kinds of agricultural products (brown rice, soybean, spinach, cabbage, potato, orange, apple, strawberry, and Japanese pear) fortified with 170 pesticides at 0.01 and 0.1 μg/g. Each concentration of pesticide residue was extracted from 2 samples on 5 separate days.

25026202,"Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) juice is known for its ability to alter drug metabolism through inhibition of the cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4) system, and result in drug-food interactions that may be life threatening. The primary active ingredients in grapefruit responsible for these effects are the furanocoumarins bergapten, bergamottin, and 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin (DHB). Bergamottin and DHB appear to be the most important in terms of adverse drug interactions. Furanocoumarins are present in the juices and fruits of other Citrus species including C. aurantium (bitter oranges). Bergapten is the predominant furanocoumarin in bitter orange. Bitter orange extracts are widely used in products associated with weight loss, sports performance, and energy production. Questions have been raised about the potential of bitter orange extracts to cause drug interactions. This study examined the furanocoumarin content of four standardized bitter orange extracts (Advantra Z®) by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy.

24961635,"Laser-ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) does not require very flat surfaces, high-precision sample preparation, or the addition of matrix. Because of these features, LAESI-MSI may be the method of choice for spatially-resolved food analysis. In this work, LAESI time-of-flight MSI was investigated for macroscopic and microscopic imaging of pesticides, mycotoxins, and plant metabolites on rose leaves, orange and lemon fruit, ergot bodies, cherry tomatoes, and maize kernels. Accurate mass ion-map data were acquired at sampling locations with an x-y center-to-center distance of 0.2-1.0 mm and were superimposed onto co-registered optical images. The spatially-resolved ion maps of pesticides on rose leaves suggest co-application of registered and banned pesticides. Ion maps of the fungicide imazalil reveal that this compound is only localized on the peel of citrus fruit. However, according to three-dimensional LAESI-MSI the penetration depth of imazalil into the peel has significant local variation. Ion maps of different plant alkaloids on ergot bodies from rye reveal co-localization in accordance with expectations. The feasibility of using untargeted MSI for food analysis was revealed by ion maps of plant metabolites in cherry tomatoes and maize-kernel slices. For tomatoes, traveling-wave ion mobility (TWIM) was used to discriminate between different lycoperoside glycoalkaloid isomers; for maize quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) was successfully used to elucidate the structure of a localized unknown. It is envisaged that LAESI-MSI will contribute to future research in food science, agriforensics, and plant metabolomics.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D005506', 'D007834', 'D009183', 'D021241']","['Food Contamination', 'Lasers', 'Mycotoxins', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Macroscopic and microscopic spatially-resolved analysis of food contaminants and constituents using laser-ablation electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961635,2015
24909674,"As a consequence of the increased use of silver nanoparticles in food, food contact materials, dietary supplements and cosmetics to prevent fungal and bacterial growth, there is a need for validated rapid screening methods to assess the safety of nanoparticle exposure. This study evaluated two widely used in vitro cell culture models, human liver HepG2 cells and human colon Caco2 cells, as tools for assessing the potential genotoxicity of 20-nm nanosilver. The average silver nanoparticle size as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was 20.4 nm. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis showed no large agglomeration of the silver nanoparticles. The silver concentration in a 20-nm nanosilver solution determined by the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis was 0.962 mg ml(-1) . Analysis by ICP-MS and TEM demonstrated the uptake of 20-nm silver by both HepG2 and Caco2 cells. Genotoxicity was determined by the cytochalasin B-blocked micronucleus assay with acridine orange staining and fluorescence microscopy. Concentration- and time-dependent increases in the frequency of binucleated cells with micronuclei induced by the nanosilver was observed in the concentration range of 0.5 to 15 µg ml(-1) in both HepG2 and Caco2 cells compared with the control. Our results indicated that HepG2 cells were more sensitive than Caco2 cells in terms of micronuclei formation induced by nanosilver exposure.

Mass spectrometric conditions were individually optimized for each compound in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode to achieve maximum sensitivity. The pesticides were separated in less than 25 min. This was followed by an exhaustive control of the retention times. The Retention Time Locking Method was applied, working at a constant pressure throughout the analysis. System maintenance was reduced by using a purged capillary flow device that provided backflush capabilities by reversing column flow immediately after elution of the last compound of interest.

24828980,"An atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source has been used to enhance the potential of gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry (MS) for screening and quantification purposes in pesticide residue analysis. A screening method developed in our laboratory for around 130 pesticides has been applied to fruit and vegetable samples, including strawberries, oranges, apples, carrots, lettuces, courgettes, red peppers, and tomatoes. Samples were analyzed together with quality control samples (at 0.05 mg/kg) for each matrix and for matrix-matched calibration standards. The screening strategy consisted in first rapid searching and detection, and then a refined identification step using the QTOF capabilities (MS(E) and accurate mass). Identification was based on the presence of one characteristic m/z ion (Q) obtained with the low collision energy function and at least one fragment ion (q) obtained with the high collision energy function, both with mass errors of less than 5 ppm, and an ion intensity ratio (q/Q) within the tolerances permitted. Following this strategy, 15 of 130 pesticides were identified in the samples. Afterwards, the quantitation capabilities were tested by performing a quantitative validation for those pesticides detected in the samples. To this aim, five matrices were selected (orange, apple, tomato, lettuce, and carrot) and spiked at two concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg), and quantification was done using matrix-matched calibration standards (relative responses versus triphenyl phosphate used as an internal standard). Acceptable average recoveries and relative standard deviations were obtained for many but not all pesticide-matrix combinations. These figures allowed us to perform a retrospective quantification of positives found in the screening without the need for additional analysis. Taking advantage of the accurate-mass full-spectrum data provided by QTOF MS, we searched for a higher number of compounds (up to 416 pesticides) in a second stage by performing extra data processing without any new sample injection. Several more pesticides were detected, confirmed, and/or tentatively identified when the reference standard was unavailable, illustrating in this way the potential of gas chromatography-QTOF MS to detect pesticides in addition to the ones targeted in quantitative analysis of pesticides in food matrices.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D001274', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D010573', 'D014675']","['Atmospheric Pressure', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Vegetables']",Screening and quantification of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables making use of gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828980,2015

24756094,"Carotenoids are well known for their nutritional properties and health promoting effects representing attractive ingredients to develop innovative functional foods, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical preparations. Pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.) flesh has an intense yellow/orange color owing to the high level of carotenoids, mainly α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin. There is considerable interest in extracting carotenoids and other bioactives from pumpkin flesh. Extraction procedures able to preserve nutritional and pharmacological properties of carotenoids are essential. Conventional extraction methods, such as organic solvent extraction (CSE), have been used to extract carotenoids from plant material for a long time. In recent years, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction has received a great deal of attention because it is a green technology suitable for the extraction of lipophylic molecules and is able to give extracts of high quality and totally free from potentially toxic chemical solvents. Here, we review the results obtained so far on SC-CO2 extraction efficiency and quali-quantitative composition of carotenoids from pumpkin flesh.

The method was successfully tested on various cassava samples containing between 6 and 200 mg equiv. HCN/kg as verified with isonicotinate/1,3-dimethylbarbiturate as an independent method. The affinity of ACCA sensor to cyanide is high, coordination occurs fast and the colorimetric response can therefore be instantaneously monitored with spectrophotometric methods. Direct applications of the sensor without need of extensive and laborious extraction processes are demonstrated in water-extracted samples, in acid-extracted samples, and directly on juice drops. ACCA showed high precision with a standard deviation (STDV) between 0.03 and 0.06 and high accuracy (93-96%). Overall, the ACCA procedure is straightforward, safe and easily performed.

High-resolving power mass spectrometry analysis (including bottom-up and top-down protein analysis) was used for the discovery of specific markers of phage infection. Structural components of the viral particle and nonstructural proteins encoded by the phage genome were identified. Then, targeted detection of these markers was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the selected reaction monitoring mode.

24444083,"Antagonistic interactions between predators and prey often lead to co-evolution. In the case of toxic prey, aposematic colours act as warning signals for predators and play a protective role. Evolutionary convergence in colour patterns among toxic prey evolves due to positive density-dependent selection and the benefits of mutual resemblance in spreading the mortality cost of educating predators over a larger prey assemblage. Comimetic species evolve highly similar colour patterns, but such convergence may interfere with intraspecific signalling and recognition in the prey community, especially for species involved in polymorphic mimicry. Using spectrophotometry measures, we investigated the variation in wing coloration among comimetic butterflies from distantly related lineages. We focused on seven morphs of the polymorphic species Heliconius numata and the seven corresponding comimetic species from the genus Melinaea. Significant differences in the yellow, orange and black patches of the wing were detected between genera. Perceptions of these cryptic differences by bird and butterfly observers were then estimated using models of animal vision based on physiological data. Our results showed that the most strikingly perceived differences were obtained for the contrast of yellow against a black background. The capacity to discriminate between comimetic genera based on this colour contrast was also evaluated to be higher for butterflies than for birds, suggesting that this variation in colour, likely undetectable to birds, might be used by butterflies for distinguishing mating partners without losing the benefits of mimicry. The evolution of wing colour in mimetic butterflies might thus be shaped by the opposite selective pressures exerted by predation and species recognition.",Journal of evolutionary biology,"['D000818', 'D005075', 'D002080', 'D003116', 'D011235', 'D013053', 'D014921']","['Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Butterflies', 'Color', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Wings, Animal']",Cryptic differences in colour among Müllerian mimics: how can the visual capacities of predators and prey shape the evolution of wing colours?,"[None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'genetics', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444083,2016

The composition of Monascus pigments and the final pH of fermentation broth after Monascus fermentation were determined. It was found that nitrogen source was directly related to the final pH and the final pH regulated the composition of Monascus pigments and the biosynthesis of citrinin. Thus, an ideal nitrogen source can be selected to control the final pH and then the citrinin biosynthesis. Citrinin-free orange pigments were produced at extremely low initial pH in the medium with (NH4)₂SO₄ or MSG as nitrogen source.

Approved therapies for treating chronic HBV infections usually target the multifunctional viral polymerase (hPOL). Unfortunately, these therapies--broad-spectrum antivirals--are not general cures, have side effects, and cause viral resistance. While hPOL remains an attractive therapeutic target, it is notoriously difficult to express and purify in a soluble form at yields appropriate for structural studies. Thus, no empirical structural data exist for hPOL, and this impedes medicinal chemistry and rational lead discovery efforts targeting HBV. Here, we present an efficient strategy to overexpress recombinant hPOL domains in Escherichia coli, purifying them at high yield and solving their known aggregation tendencies. This allowed us to perform the first structural and biophysical characterizations of hPOL domains. Apo-hPOL domains adopt mainly α-helical structures with small amounts of β-sheet structures. Our recombinant material exhibited metal-dependent, reverse transcriptase activity in vitro, with metal binding modulating the hPOL structure.

The complex-imprinted polymer was introduced as a novel SPME coating using a ""complex template"" constructed with Cu(II) ions and TBZ. The recognition and enrichment properties of the coating in water were significantly improved based on the metal ion coordination interaction rather than relying on hydrogen bonding interactions that are commonly applied for the molecularly imprinting technique. Several parameters controlling the extraction performance of the complex-imprinted-polymer-coated fiber were investigated including extraction solvent, pH value, extraction time, metal ion species, etc. Furthermore, SPME coupled with HPLC was developed for detection of TBZ, and the methods resulted in good linearity in the range of 10.0-150.0 ng/mL with a detection limit of 2.4 ng/mL. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of TBZ in spiked soil, orange, and lemon with recoveries of 80.0-86.9% and RSDs of 2.0-8.1%. This research provides an example to prepare a desirable water-compatible and specifically selective SPME coating to extract target molecules from aqueous samples by introducing metal ions as the mediator.

In Eastern countries, a large number of people have suffered from shang huo as a result of excessive consumption of ""heating"" foods, such as lychee, longan, mandarin orange, mango and civet durian. The present study adopted a step by step strategy screened the compositions with pro-inflammatory effect in satsuma fruits. The pro-inflammatory effects of all fractions were evaluated in RAW 264.7 cell lines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and RT-PCR tests. The soluble water extract (SWE) from satsuma increased the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and promoted the expression level of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA. SWE and high molecular weight molecules extracted from soluble water extract (HSWE) were respectively fractionated by dialysis bags and gel filtration chromatography. The macromolecular fraction named F1 was further obtained from HSWE, and could increase the production of inflammatory mediators. Finally F1 was resolved by SDS-PAGE and six proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Compared with other detected proteins, polygalacturonase inhibitor (PGIP) and chitinase were the most likely candidate pro-inflammatory proteins according to molecular mass, and both of them were Citrus unshiu species. cDNA sequences of PGIP and chitinase were cloned and their functions were predicted as defensive proteins by SMART analysis.

A detailed investigation of Dermacoccus abyssi MT1.1(T) with respect to the azoreductase activity and enzymatic mechanism as well as the potential role of the bacterial strain for biocleaning of industrial dye baths is reported. Resting cells with oxygen-insensitive azoreductase resulted in the rapid decolorization of the polysulfonated dye Brilliant Black BN (BBN) which is a common food colorant. The highest specific decolorization rate (vs) was found at 50 °C with a moderately thermal tolerance for over 1 h. Kinetic analysis showed the high rates and strong affinity of the enzymatic system for the dye with a Vmax = 137 mg/g cell/h and a Km = 19 mg/L. The degradation of BBN produces an initial orange intermediate, 8-amino-5-((4-sulfonatophenyl)diazenyl)naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, identified by mass spectrometry which is later converted to 4-aminobenzene sulfonic acid. Nearly 80% of the maximum vs is possible achieved in resting cell treatment with the salinity increased up to 5.0% NaCl in reaction media.

A new coupling in the area of compound-specific carbon 13 isotope ratio (δ(13)C) analysis was developed to simultaneously quantify δ(13)C values of sugars and organic acids. The coupling of ion chromatography (IC) together with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) can be achieved using a liquid interface allowing a chemical oxidation (co) of organic matter. Synthetic solutions containing 1 polyol (glycerol), 3 carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose and fructose) and 12 organic acids (gluconic, lactic, malic, tartaric, oxalic, fumaric, citric and isocitric) were used to optimize chromatographic conditions (concentration gradient and 3 types of column) and the studied isotopic range (-32.28 to -10.65‰) corresponds to the values found in food products. Optimum chromatographic conditions are found using an IonPac AS15, an elution flow rate of 0.3mLmin(-1) and a linear concentration gradient from 2 to 76mM (rate 21mMmin(-1)). Comparison between δ(13)C value individually obtained for each compound with the coupling IRMS and elemental analyzer, EA-IRMS, and the ones measured on the mixture of compounds by IC-co-IRMS does not reveal any isotope fractionation. Thus, under these experimental conditions, IC-co-IRMS results are accurate and reproducible. This new coupling was tested on two food matrices, an orange juice and a sweet wine. Some optimization is necessary as the concentration range between sugars and organic acids is too large: an increase in the filament intensity of the IRMS is necessary to simultaneously detect the two compound families. These first attempts confirm the good results obtained on synthetic solutions and the strong potential of the coupling IC-co-IRMS in food authentication area. ",Journal of chromatography.

On the basis of these reports, water, ethanol and methanol soluble fractions were prepared from dried bee-pollen commercially available and produced by La Montaña farm (Mérida, Venezuela). These fractions were evaluated for their functional properties, specifically, polyphenol content and total antioxidant activity. Pollen samples were separated by color in four fractions: yellow, brown, orange and ochre. Polyphenol content ranged between 396.7 to 1286.7 gallic acid equivalents GAE/100 g pollen; it was highest in pollen homogenates obtained with ethanol, followed by those obtained with methanol and water. The antioxidant activity ranged from 0.50 to 1.84 micromoles Trolox equivalents TEAC/100 g for water and ethanol homogenates respectively. The results presented in this work suggest that the ethanol extract of bee pollen show a potent antioxidant activity, comparable to human plasma, probably due to total polyphenol content of bee pollen. This is important because the bee pollen would be beneficial not only as a dietary supplement but also as a functional food.",Archivos latinoamericanos de nutricion,"['D000704', 'D000818', 'D000975', 'D001516', 'D011058', 'D059808', 'D013053', 'D014687']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Bees', 'Pollen', 'Polyphenols', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Venezuela']","Antioxidant activity of four color fractions of bee pollen from Mérida, Venezuela.","[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24020258,2014

Three different types of drinks are bought from market; huddled orange fruit drink (100%) (I), red-oranges (II) and multivitamin drink containing strawberry, orange, banana and maracuja (III). Samples were analyzed ""with"" and ""without"" pulp utilizing LC-ESI (or APCI) MS/MS, HPLC-ESI-(or APCI)-MS/MS and UV-MALDI-Orbitrap-MS methods. The effect of high complexity of the food matrix on the analysis was discussed. Study focuses on the advantages of the UV-MALDI-Orbitrap-MS method compared to the traditionally involved GC alone or hybrid methods such as GC-MS and LC-MS/MS for quantification of pesticides in water and soft drinks. The developed method included the techniques performed for validation, calibration and standardization. The target pesticides are widely used for the treatment of citrus fruits and pineapples, but for soft drink products, there are still no clear regulations on pesticide residues limits. The matrix effects in the analysis of fruit drinks required implementation of the exact standard reference material corresponds to the variety of food matrices.

23994674,"The spectroscopic properties of Sm(3+) ions in lead bismosilicate glasses (PBSS) as a function of bismuth oxide were investigated using optical absorption and fluorescence spectra. These glasses have shown strong absorption and emission bands in the near infrared and visible region respectively. From the measured absorption spectra, Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters Ω2, Ω4 and Ω6 were determined by applying least square analysis method. The variation of Ω2 and Ω6 with Bi2O3 content has been attributed to changes in the asymmetry of the ligand field at the rare earth ion site and to the changes in the rare earth oxygen (RE-O) covalency. The variation of Ω4 with Bi2O3 content has been attributed to rigidity of the samples. Using the Judd Ofelt intensity parameters the other radiative properties like radiative transition probability, radiative life time, branching ratio and the stimulated emission cross-sections of prepared PBSS glasses have been calculated. The values of radiative properties indicate that Sm(3+) ions emit intense reddish-orange emission ((4)G5/2→(6)H7/2) under excitation at 450 nm wavelength.","Spectrochimica acta.

Metal monitoring in food, like sweet potatoes, provides basic information on safety aspects in regulatory processes as well as nutritional values. One hundred five samples of three varieties of sweet potatoes were randomly obtained from supermarkets, farmers markets, and farmers' plots in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). The edible portion (pulp) was the only part considered for analysis. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine the contents of sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn), while the levels of chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The mean concentrations were 500 Na, 4409 K, 564 Ca, 609 Mg, 1.291 Cu, 6.554 Fe, 2.324 Mn, 2.348 Zn, 0.028 Cr, 0.048 Ni, 0.001 Cd, and 0.003 Pb mg/kg, respectively. Potassium presented the highest contents in all varieties of sweet potatoes. Iron was the most abundant microelement. The orange fleshed sweet potato variety offered greater nutritional contributions to the recommended intakes than the rest of the varieties studied. The estimated mean daily intake of Ni (0.72 mg/day) detected in our samples was highly consistent with other studies. Average daily intakes of Cd (0.015 μg/day) and Pb (0.045 μg/day) were below toxicological reference values.

This strain showed high activity in the decolorization of textile azo dyes, especially methyl orange, reactive red 198, and recalcitrant dye Congo red, decolorizing at rates of 96.2, 93.0, and 87.5%, respectively. SXM had the best performance for the specific decolorization rate (SDR) of azo dyes compared to Proteus hauseri ZMd44 and Aeromonas hydrophila NIU01 strains and had an SDR similar to Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in Congo red decolorization. Luria-Bertani medium was the optimal culture medium for SXM, as it reached a density of 4.69 g-DCW L(-1) at 16 h. A mediator (manganese) significantly enhanced the biodegradation and flocculation of Congo red. Further analysis with UV-VIS, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that Congo red was cleaved at the azo bond, producing 4,4'-diamino-1,1'-biphenyl and 1,2'-diamino naphthalene 4-sulfonic acid. Finally, SEM results revealed that nanowires exist between the bacteria, indicating that SXM degradation of the azo dyes was coupled with electron transfer through the nanowires.

23973661,"In order to broaden the available genetic variation of melon, we developed an ethyl methanesulfonate mutation library in an orange-flesh 'Charentais' type melon line that accumulates β-carotene. One mutagenized M2 family segregated for a novel recessive trait, a yellow-orange fruit flesh ('yofI'). HPLC analysis revealed that 'yofI' accumulates pro-lycopene (tetra-cis-lycopene) as its major fruit pigment. The altered carotenoid composition of 'yofI' is associated with a significant change of the fruit aroma since cleavage of β-carotene yields different apocarotenoids than the cleavage of pro-lycopene. Normally, pro-lycopene is further isomerized by CRTISO (carotenoid isomerase) to yield all-trans-lycopene, which is further cyclized to β-carotene in melon fruit. Cloning and sequencing of 'yofI' CRTISO identified two mRNA sequences which lead to truncated forms of CRTISO. Sequencing of the genomic CRTISO identified an A-T transversion in 'yofI' which leads to a premature STOP codon. The early carotenoid pathway genes were up regulated in yofI fruit causing accumulation of other intermediates such as phytoene and ζ-carotene. Total carotenoid levels are only slightly increased in the mutant.

23909654,"The behavioral responses of foraging adults of Kallima inachus (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) to four colors and to six different fermented fruit juices were observed in order to determine the cues used by foraging adults. According to the results, adults did not show a behavioral response to red, yellow, purple, or white artificial flowers without food odors, but flowers with the fermented pear juice strongly attracted them, and they showed a behavioral response to fermented juices of the six fruits (pear, apple, banana, watermelon, orange, and persimmon) with no statistically significant preference. The fruit volatiles were collected using dynamic headspace adsorption, and the volatile components were analyzed by auto thermal-desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to assess which volatiles existed in the fruits. Only alcohols, esters, and ketones were common in the volatiles of all six fermenting fruits. The five volatile components found in the six fruits, as well as two others found to be in other fermented foods by previous studies, were selected to test the behavioral and electroantennogram (EAG) responses of naive adults to estimate behavioral preference and antennal perception. In field behavioral tests, alcohols were the most attractive, followed by esters, while α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were much less attractive. Relative to other volatile combinations and ethanol alone, the mixture of ethyl acetate and ethanol attracted the most feeding adults. The number of adults attracted was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of both ethanol and ethyl acetate. The EAG responses of naive adults showed that the EAG responses to 3-methyl-1-butanol, isoamyl acetate, ethyl acetate, α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were all higher than those to ethanol (100%) at doses of either 5 µl/mL or 50 µl/mL. Sexual differences only existed in 3-methyl-1-butanol and acetic acid at particular concentrations. Sexual differences in response to chemical mixtures were not significant at 50 µl/mL. In addition, the EAG responses in the within-sex trials were not correlated to the dosage (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, and µl/mL) of either ethanol or ethyl acetate.

The method is well suited as a quick screening method for fruit juice adulteration and if used routinely would reduce fruit juice adulteration without the cost of the current array of tests needed for authenticity testing.","Food additives & contaminants.

Herein, we develop a facile strategy to assemble the vertically aligned monolayer of Au nanorods with a nominal 0.8 nm gap distance and demonstrate their applications in the rapid detection of plasticizers and melamine contamination at femtomolar level by surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy (SERS). The SERS signals of plasticizers are sensitive down to 0.9 fM concentrations in orange juices. It is the lowest detection limit reported to date, which is 7 orders of magnitude lower than the standard of United States (6 ppb).

The imprinted polymers-which were prepared via the covalent reaction of 3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl isocyanate with the template molecules-were attached to the surface of silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles, and a simple thermal reaction was then performed to remove the templates, leaving spaces with specific noncovalent bonds for target re-recognition. The conditions for the synthesis of the MIP were optimized during the polymerization experiments to improve the adsorption capacity and selectivity. The resulting polymers were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to confirm their structure. The MIPs were subjected to an online solid-phase extraction and a magnetic molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction procedure.

The berries were cultivated in the region Emilia-Romagna, in Northern Italy. The native carotenoid composition was directly investigated by an HPLC-DAD-APCI-MS methodology, for the first time. In total, 52 carotenoids have been identified and considerable variation in carotenoid composition was observed among the various cultivars investigated. Among the cultivars with red colour, some Habanero, Naga morich and Sinpezon showed an high β-carotene content, whereas Serrano, Tabasco and Jalapeno showed an high capsanthin content and the absence of β-carotene. Habanero golden and Scotch Bonnet showed a high lutein, α-carotene and β-carotene amounts, and Habanero orange was rich in antheraxanthin, capsanthin and zeaxanthin. Cis-cryptocapsin was present in high amount in Habanero chocolate. The qualitative and quantitative determination of the capsaicinoids, alkaloids responsible for the pungency level, has also been estimated by a validated chromatographic procedure (HPLC-DAD) after a preliminary drying step and an opportune extraction procedure.

23402364,"Originally identified as an innate cytotoxin, nitric oxide ((·)NO) formation in tumors can influence chemotherapy and exacerbate cancer progression. Here, we examined the hypothesis that (·)NO generation contributes to cancer cell drug resistance toward the widely used anticancer drug Etoposide (VP-16). The UV-vis spectrum of VP-16 was not changed by exposure of VP-16 to (·)NO in aqueous buffer. In contrast, reddish-orange compound(s) characteristic of o-quinone- and nitroso-VP-16 were readily generated in a hydrophobic medium (chloroform) in an oxygen-dependent manner. Similar products were also formed when the VP-16 radical, generated from VP-16 and horseradish peroxidase/H2O2, was exposed directly to (·)NO in chloroform in the presence of oxygen. Separation and spectral analysis of VP-16 reaction extracts by electron spin resonance and UV-vis indicated the generation of the phenoxy radical and the o-quinone of VP-16, as well as putative nitroxide, iminoxyl, and other nitrogen oxide intermediates. Nitric oxide products of VP-16 displayed significantly diminished topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA and cytotoxicity to human HL-60 leukemia cells.

23356415,"Study of xenobiotics present in fruit peel by exposing it (without any pretreatment) to direct analysis in real time coupled to a high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer (DART-HRMS) is reported for the first time. Variables such as DART gas heater temperature and pressure, source-to-MS distance, and sample velocity are investigated. The analysis of one sample by DART-MS lasts ca. 1 min, and the benefits of both high-resolution and tandem mass spectrometry to elucidate nontarget or unknown compounds are combined. Identification of postharvest fungicides, antioxidants, and sugars in fruit peel is performed in the positive ion mode. A possible elemental formula is suggested for marker components. The lowest imazalil concentration that could be detected by this system is 1 ng (equivalent to a concentration of ca. 300 μg kg(-1)), which is well below the maximum residue limit. For oranges and apples, direct peel exposition demonstrated good interday precision (within 20% for any concentration) and proper linearity (R(2) ≥ 0.99), with a dynamic range from 1 to 2500 ng for apple. A comparison of the results obtained using the direct peel screening DART-based method is made with those obtained by DART analysis of solvent extracts, as well as those obtained analyzing these extracts by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap).

23314817,"Chromoplasts are unique plastids that accumulate massive amounts of carotenoids. To gain a general and comparative characterization of chromoplast proteins, this study performed proteomic analysis of chromoplasts from six carotenoid-rich crops: watermelon, tomato, carrot, orange cauliflower, red papaya, and red bell pepper. Stromal and membrane proteins of chromoplasts were separated by 1D gel electrophoresis and analysed using nLC-MS/MS. A total of 953-2262 proteins from chromoplasts of different crop species were identified. Approximately 60% of the identified proteins were predicted to be plastid localized. Functional classification using MapMan bins revealed large numbers of proteins involved in protein metabolism, transport, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and redox in chromoplasts from all six species. Seventeen core carotenoid metabolic enzymes were identified. Phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, ζ-carotene desaturase, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 were found in almost all crops, suggesting relative abundance of them among the carotenoid pathway enzymes. Chromoplasts from different crops contained abundant amounts of ATP synthase and adenine nucleotide translocator, which indicates an important role of ATP production and transport in chromoplast development. Distinctive abundant proteins were observed in chromoplast from different crops, including capsanthin/capsorubin synthase and fibrillins in pepper, superoxide dismutase in watermelon, carrot, and cauliflower, and glutathione-S-transferease in papaya. The comparative analysis of chromoplast proteins among six crop species offers new insights into the general metabolism and function of chromoplasts as well as the uniqueness of chromoplasts in specific crop species.

The new method is designed to be applied to ESI-compatible electrolytes (e.g. ammonium acetate) and offers advanced tuning of selectivity conditions within a wide range of analyte mobilities. We use a full capillary ITP format to provide powerful on-line analyte stacking at the ITP boundary all the way to detection and introduce the model of extended ITP where a controlled concentration of the leading ion is added to the terminating zone. Such systems preserve all properties of an ITP system and the velocity of the stacking ITP boundary can be tuned by the composition of both the leading and terminating zone. In this way, the system properties can be controlled flexibly and the mobility window of stacked analytes can be tailored to actual needs. The presented theory and the newly defined concept of zone-related boundary mobility allow easy assessment of system selectivity using simple diagrams. We demonstrate the model and its potential on the example of simple acidic cationic systems composed of only two substances (ammonium and acetate) including the example of thiabendazole analysis with a detection limit of 10(-10) M (20 ng/L) and its determination in orange juice by direct sampling after filtration, selective stacking by a tuned extended ITP system, and ESI-MS detection.",Electrophoresis,"['D000085', 'D001628', 'D002412', 'D032084', 'D004573', 'D019075', 'D057625', 'D057230', 'D010573', 'D021241', 'D013827']","['Acetates', 'Beverages', 'Cations', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Isotachophoresis', 'Limit of Detection', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Thiabendazole']",Advanced electrolyte tuning and selectivity enhancement for highly sensitive analysis of cations by capillary ITP-ESI MS.,"['Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","['chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23229919,2013

For the correct interpretation of analytical results, uncertainties of extraction and clean-up steps should be taken into account when the combined uncertainty of the analytical result is estimated. In the scope of this study, uncertainties of extraction and clean-up steps were investigated by spiking (14)C-labelled chlorpyrifos to analytical portions of tomato, orange, apple, green bean, cucumber, jackfruit, papaya and starfruit. After each step, replicate measurements were carried out with a liquid scintillation counter. Uncertainties in extraction and clean-up steps were estimated separately for every matrix and method combination by using within-laboratory reproducibility standard deviation and were characterised with the CV of recoveries. It was observed that the uncertainty of the ethyl acetate extraction step varied between 0.8% and 5.9%. The relative standard uncertainty of the clean-up step with dispersive SPE used in the method known as QuEChERS was estimated to be around 1.5% for tomato, apple and green beans. The highest variation of 4.8% was observed in cucumber.

23182936,"Gas and liquid chromatography (GC and LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) serve as the most powerful analytical tools commonly used to monitor pesticide residues in food, among other applications. However, both GC-MS and LC-MS are susceptible to matrix effects which can adversely affect quantification depending on the analyte, matrix, sample preparation, instrumentation, and operating conditions. Among the approaches that reduce matrix effects, the most common in pesticide residue applications is matrix-matched calibration because it is relatively inexpensive and simple. Also, it has been shown to work well during method validation when fortified samples are exactly matched with samples used for calibration. However, the quality of matrix-matched results in real-world analyses depends on the consistency of matrix effects among diverse samples. In this study, the variability of matrix effects was measured for 38 representative pesticides in 20 samples each (including different varieties) of rice, orange, apple, and spinach extracted using the ""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe"" (QuEChERS) method for analysis by LC-MS/MS and low-pressure GC-MS. Using LC-MS/MS, only oranges gave >20% matrix effects for a few pesticides. GC-MS exhibited larger matrix effects, but as in LC-MS/MS, the differences were reasonably consistent among the 20 samples tested. Main conclusions of this study are that for the conditions utilized: (1) matrix-matching was not needed for most pesticides in the simpler food matrices; and (2) for the more complex orange matrix, acceptably accurate quantitative results were achieved by using matrix-matching even with a different sample of the same type.

23124390,"Pepper fruit is typically red, but green, orange and yellow cultivars are gaining consumer acceptance. This color variation is mainly due to variations in carotenoid composition. Orange color in pepper can result from a number of carotenoid profiles, but its genetic basis is only partly known. We identified an EMS-induced orange-fruited mutant using the wild-type blocky red-fruited cultivar 'Maor' as progenitor. This mutant accumulates mainly β-carotene in its fruit, instead of the complex pattern of red and yellow carotenoids in 'Maor'. We identified an A(709) to G transition in the cDNA of β-CAROTENE HYDROXYLASE2 in the orange pepper and complete co-segregation of this single-nucleotide polymorphism with the mutated phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that β-CAROTENE HYDROXYLASE2 controls the orange mutation in pepper. Interestingly, the expression of β-CAROTENE HYDROXYLASE2 and additional carotenogenesis genes was elevated in the orange fruit compared with the red fruit, indicating possible feedback regulation of genes in the pathway. Because carotenoids serve as precursors for volatile compounds, we compared the volatile profiles of the two parents. The orange pepper contained more volatile compounds than 'Maor', with predominant elevation of norisoprenoids derived from β-carotene degradation, while sesquiterpenes predominated in the red fruit. Because of the importance of β-carotene as a provitamin A precursor in the human diet, the orange-fruited mutant might serve as a natural source for pepper fruit biofortification.

This work demonstrates a new analytical method and its utility for visual detection of aqueous Hg(2+) on the basis of a novel water-soluble CdSe-ZnS quantum dots (QDs) functionalized with a bidentate ligand of 2-hydroxyethyldithiocarbamate (HDTC). The fluorescence of the aqueous HDTC modified QDs (HDTC-QDs) could be selectively and efficiently quenched by Hg(2+) through a surface chelating reaction between HDTC and Hg(2+), and the detection limit was measured to be 1 ppb. Most interestingly, the orange fluorescence of the HDTC-QDs gradually changes to red upon the increasing amount of Hg(2+) added besides the decreasing of the fluorescence intensity. By taking advantage of this optical phenomenon, a paper-based sensor for aqueous Hg(2+) detection has been developed by immobilizing the HDTC-QDs on cellulose acetate paper which has low background fluorescence in the wavelength range. The paper-based sensor showed high sensitivity and selectivity for Hg(2+) visual detection. When Hg(2+) was dropped onto the paper-sensor, an obviously distinguishable fluorescence color evolution (from orange to red) could be clearly observed depending on the concentration of Hg(2+).

Blinded statistical evaluation revealed signals from all added contaminants detectable by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation using positive ionisation mode, while only two false-positive signals were reported. The method is primarily intended to be used for investigation of food samples suspected to be contaminated with unknown substances. Additionally it could be used to continuously monitor for appearance of new food contaminants as a complement to the specific targeted analysis that is today's foundation of food safety analysis.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D001628', 'D002851', 'D032084', 'D005506', 'D055432', 'D021241']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Food Contamination', 'Metabolomics', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",A concept study on non-targeted screening for chemical contaminants in food using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in combination with a metabolomics approach.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23114929,2013
23092184,"A new method combining QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) and DLLME (dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring (SIM) was developed for the simultaneous determination of 19 pesticides from nine chemical groups exhibiting or suspected to exhibit endocrine-disrupting properties in orange samples. Acetonitrile extract obtained from QuEChERS extraction was used for DLLME as dispersive solvent and carbon tetrachloride as extractive solvent to increase the enrichment factor of the extraction procedure. The effect of several extraction parameters, such as volume extract achieved by the QuEChERS method and subsequently used for DLLME, selection of extractive solvent and its volume, was tested. Under optimum conditions, good linearity, satisfactory recoveries and repeatability were obtained. Limits of quantification (LOQs) achieved (ranging from 0.02 to 47 ng/g) were below the maximum residue limits established by the European Union.

Until now, only PDMS-coated stir bars are commercially available, restricting the range of applications to the non-selective extraction of hydrophobic compounds due to the apolar character of PDMS. In this work, a novel stir bar coated with molecularly imprinted polymer as selective extraction phase for sorptive extraction of thiabendazole (TBZ) was developed. Two different procedures, based on physical or chemical coating, were assessed for the preparation of molecularly imprinted stir bars. Under optimum conditions, recoveries achieved both in imprinted and non-imprinted polymer stir bars obtained by physical coating were very low, whereas TBZ was favourably retained by imprinted over non-imprinted polymer stir bars obtained by chemical coating and thus the latter approach was used in further studies. Different parameters affecting both stir-bars preparation (i.e. cross-linker, porogen, polymerization time) and the subsequent selective extraction of TBZ (i.e. washing, loading and elution solvents, extraction time) were properly optimized.

23058941,"Multiresidue methods (MRMs) for pesticides residues determination in fruit and vegetables, based on GC-MS, are mainly performed in electron impact ionization mode. However an important group of them provide much better response working in negative chemical ionization mode due to the elimination of a high percentage of background signal. Considering that a selective and sensitive method has been developed for the determination of multiclass pesticide residues in different commodities by GC-MS with a triple stage quadrupole analyzer (GC-TSQ-MS); the pesticide signal has been optimized in MS-MS whilst working in negative chemical ionization mode using methane as the reagent gas. The proposed method was fully validated for 53 compounds in tomato, apple and orange matrices. The obtained limits of determination were lower than 0.1 μg/kg for more than 50% of the pesticides studied, and lower than 1 μg/kg for all pesticides studied, except for cypermethrin, boscalid, bifenthrin and deltamethrin. Linearity was studied in the 0.5-50 μg/kg range and a linear response was obtained for all pesticides in all matrices. Recoveries were evaluated at two different levels (1 and 50 μg/kg) and recoveries were ranged between 70 and 120% in tomato, apple and orange, except in the cases of chlorfenapyr, ofurace, chlozolinate, chlorothalonil, tolylfluanid and dichlofluanid with recovery values close to 60% at 1 μg/kg fortification levels. Repetitivity was evaluated and the relative standard deviation (RSD%) was lower than 10% in all cases. The developed method was employed in the analysis of real samples intended for baby food and the obtained results showed that 50% of the samples were positive for different pesticide residues. The concentration range detected was between 5 and 100 μg/kg. The positive detection of OCs was particularly noticeable; these included chlorothalonil, fenhexamide, clorpyrifos and lambda cyhalothrin, which are very persistent and toxic with low acute reference dose.

23053561,"β-Carotene is the major dietary source of provitamin A. Central cleavage of β-carotene yields 2 molecules of retinal followed by further oxidation to retinoic acid. Eccentric cleavage of β-carotene occurs at double bonds other than the central double bond, and the products of these reactions are β-apocarotenals and β-apocarotenones. We reviewed recent developments in 3 areas: 1): the enzymatic production of β-apocarotenoids in higher animals; 2) the occurrence of β-apocarotenoids in foods and animal tissues; and 3) the biological activity of β-apocarotenoids, particularly on retinoid receptors. HPLC-mass spectrometry techniques were developed to quantify these compounds in mouse serum and tissues and in foods. β-Apo-10'- and -12'-carotenals were detected in mouse serum and liver. β-Apo-8'-, β-apo-10'-, β-apo-12'-, and β-apo-14'-carotenals and β-apo-13-carotenone were detected in orange-fleshed melons. Transactivation assays were performed to see whether apocarotenoids activate or antagonize retinoid X receptor (RXR) α. Reporter gene constructs and retinoid receptor (RXRα) were transfected into cells, which were used to perform quantitative assays for the activation of this ligand-dependent transcription factor. None of the β-apocarotenoids significantly activated RXRα. However, β-apo-13-carotenone antagonized the 9-cis-retinoic acid activation of RXRα. Competitive radioligand binding assays showed that this antagonist competes directly with the agonist for binding to purified receptor, a finding confirmed by molecular modeling studies. These findings suggest that a possible biological function of β-apocarotenoids is their ability to interfere with nuclear receptor signaling. Recent work showed that β-apo-13-carotenone is also a high-affinity antagonist of all 3 retinoic acid receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ).",The American journal of clinical nutrition,"['D000818', 'D002338', 'D005502', 'D051379', 'D018160', 'D018168', 'D015398', 'D015533', 'D014212', 'D019207']","['Animals', 'Carotenoids', 'Food', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin', 'beta Carotene']","The formation, occurrence, and function of β-apocarotenoids: β-carotene metabolites that may modulate nuclear receptor signaling.","[None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000037', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'antagonists & inhibitors', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23053561,2013

22984571,"Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and affect a great number of people worldwide. Essential oils, take effects through inhalation or topical application, are believed to enhance physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Although clinical studies suggest that the use of essential oils may have therapeutic potential, evidence for the efficacy of essential oils in treating medical conditions remains poor, with a particular lack of studies employing rigorous analytical methods that capture its identifiable impact on human biology. Here, we report a comprehensive gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) based metabonomics study that reveals the aromas-induced metabolic changes and the anxiolytic effect of aromas in elevated plus maze (EPM) induced anxiety model rats. The significant alteration of metabolites in the EPM group was attenuated by aromas treatment, concurrent with the behavioral improvement with significantly increased open arms time and open arms entries. Brain tissue and urinary metabonomic analysis identified a number of altered metabolites in response to aromas intervention. These metabolic changes included the increased carbohydrates and lowered levels of neurotransmitters (tryptophan, serine, glycine, aspartate, tyrosine, cysteine, phenylalanine, hypotaurine, histidine, and asparagine), amino acids, and fatty acids in the brain. Elevated aspartate, carbohydrates (sucrose, maltose, fructose, and glucose), nucleosides and organic acids such as lactate and pyruvate were also observed in the urine. The EPM induced metabolic differences observed in urine or brain tissue was significantly reduced after 10 days of aroma inhalation, as noted with the loss of statistical significance on many of the metabolites in the aroma-EPM group. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the metabonomics approach can capture the subtle metabolic changes resulting from exposure to essential oils and provide the basis for pinpointing affected pathways in anxiety-related behavior, which will lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of anxiolytic effect of essential oils.",PloS one,"['D000336', 'D000818', 'D014151', 'D001007', 'D001522', 'D001921', 'D032084', 'D005260', 'D027523', 'D013058', 'D018782', 'D055432', 'D009822', 'D010936', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D027544', 'D032123', 'D012903']","['Aerosols', 'Animals', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Female', 'Lavandula', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Maze Learning', 'Metabolomics', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Plant Extracts', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Salvia', 'Santalum', 'Smell']",The metabolic responses to aerial diffusion of essential oils.,"[None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000188', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187']","[None, None, 'pharmacology', 'drug therapy', None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'methods', None, None, 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22984571,2013

The matrix effect evaluated using a postextraction addition method was found to be negative in the range -44 to -0.5%, indicating ionization suppression and strongly depended on bioflavonoid concentration. The observed matrix effect was explained taking into account the co-elution of phenolic acids, in terms of their acid-base and hydrophilic properties. The efficacy of extraction expressed as the absolute recoveries of flavonoids were 88-96%, indicating very good efficiency of extraction. The extracts of food samples obtained either by Soxhlet or ultrasonic extraction were analyzed for bioflavonoid content by the LC-MS/MS method in selected reaction monitoring mode using a triple quadrupole detector and standard addition method, which was found to be the most suitable calibration approach for these samples. The optimized separation was achieved on a Phenomenex Gemini C18 column with gradient elution and mobile phase composition A: 2% acetic acid in water and B: acetonitrile.

A disodium ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) aqueous solution was electrosprayed to produce negatively charged primary ions which then intersected the neutral sample plume to generate anions of EDTA-Pb(II) complexes. The charged EDTA-Pb(II) complexes were characterized with multistage collision induced dissociation (CID) experiments. The limit of detection (LOD) using EESI-MS(3) was estimated to be at the level of 10(-13)g/mL for directly detecting lead in many of these samples.

22936610,"Oligonucleotide hybridization probes that fluoresce upon binding to complementary nucleic acid targets allow the real-time detection of DNA or RNA in homogeneous solution. The most commonly used probes rely on the distance-dependent interaction between a fluorophore and another label. Such dual-labeled oligonucleotides signal the change of the global conformation that accompanies duplex formation. However, undesired nonspecific binding events and/or probe degradation also lead to changes in the label-label distance and, thus, to ambiguities in fluorescence signaling. Herein, we introduce singly labeled DNA probes, ""DNA FIT probes"", that are designed to avoid false-positive signals. A thiazole orange (TO) intercalator dye serves as an artificial base in the DNA probe. The probes show little background because the attachment mode hinders 1) interactions of the ""TO base"" in cis with the disordered nucleobases of the single strand, and 2) intercalation of the ""TO nucleotide"" with double strands in trans. However, formation of the probe-target duplex enforces stacking and increases the fluorescence of the TO base. We explored open-chain and carbocyclic nucleotides. We show that the incorporation of the TO nucleotides has no effect on the thermal stability of the probe-target complexes. DNA and RNA targets provided up to 12-fold enhancements of the TO emission upon hybridization of DNA FIT probes. Experiments in cell media demonstrated that false-positive signaling was prevented when DNA FIT probes were used.

22931047,"Over the past years a number of studies have described the instability of the pigment cadmium yellow (CdS). In a previous paper we have shown how cadmium sulfide on paintings by James Ensor oxidizes to CdSO(4)·H(2)O. The degradation process gives rise to the fading of the bright yellow color and the formation of disfiguring white crystals that are present on the paint surface in approximately 50 μm sized globular agglomerations. Here, we study cadmium yellow in the painting ""Flowers in a blue vase"" by Vincent van Gogh. This painting differs from the Ensor case in the fact that (a) a varnish was superimposed onto the degraded paint surface and (b) the CdS paint area is entirely covered with an opaque crust. The latter obscures the yellow color completely and thus presents a seemingly more advanced state of degradation. Analysis of a cross-sectioned and a crushed sample by combining scanning microscopic X-ray diffraction (μ-XRD), microscopic X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (μ-XANES), microscopic X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) based chemical state mapping and scanning microscopic Fourier transform infrared (μ-FT-IR) spectrometry allowed unravelling the complex alteration pathway. Although no crystalline CdSO(4) compounds were identified on the Van Gogh paint samples, we conclude that the observed degradation was initially caused by oxidation of the original CdS pigment, similar as for the previous Ensor case. However, due to the presence of an overlying varnish containing lead-based driers and oxalate ions, secondary reactions took place. In particular, it appears that upon the photoinduced oxidation of its sulfidic counterion, the Cd(2+) ions reprecipitated at the paint/varnish interface after having formed a complex with oxalate ions that themselves are considered to be degradation products of the resin and/or oil in the varnish. The SO(4)(2-) anions, for their part, found a suitable reaction partner in Pb(2+) ions stemming from a dissolved lead-based siccative that was added to the varnish to promote its drying. The resulting opaque anglesite compound in the varnish, in combination with the underlying CdC(2)O(4) layer at the paint/varnish interface, account for the orange-gray crust that is disfiguring the painting on a macroscopic level. In this way, the results presented in this paper demonstrate how, through a judicious combined use of several microanalytical methods with speciation capabilities, many new insights can be obtained from two minute, but highly complex and heterogeneous paint samples.",Analytical chemistry,[],[],"Combined use of synchrotron radiation based micro-X-ray fluorescence, micro-X-ray diffraction, micro-X-ray absorption near-edge, and micro-fourier transform infrared spectroscopies for revealing an alternative degradation pathway of the pigment cadmium yellow in a painting by Van Gogh.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22931047,2013

22715692,"A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was developed for the determination of 40 pesticides in fruits. The effects of adding analyte protectants were evaluated for compensating matrix effects and the impacts on the quantitative results. A new combination of analyte protectants - Polyethylene Glycol 400 (PEG 400) and olive oil combination, which can be dissolved in acetone, was used for the quantitative analysis. The pesticides were extracted from fruit samples with acetonitrile and the extracts were cleaned up using micro-solid phase extraction. A GC-MS method in selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode coupled with large volume injection was finally developed. Using the newly developed analyte protectant combination of PEG 400 and olive oil, a good linearity was obtained in the range of 1 - 200 microg/L with coefficients better than 0.99, and the detection limits were between 0.1 - 3.0 microg/L. The mean recoveries of the pesticides were 75% - 119% with the relative standard deviation values less than 16.6% except for dimethoate. The performance of the analyte protectants was compared with matrix-matched standards calibration curves in terms of quantitative accuracy. The results showed that the method of adding analyte protectants can replace the matrix-matched standard calibration, and can also reduce the sample pretreatment. When the devel- oped method was used for the analysis of apple, peache, orange, banana, grape and other fruit samples, a good matrix compensation effect was achieved, and thus effectively reduced the bad effects of the water-soluble agents to the gas chromatographic column.",Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,"['D005506', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D000069463', 'D010573', 'D010938', 'D011092']","['Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Olive Oil', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plant Oils', 'Polyethylene Glycols']",[Rapid determination of 40 pesticide residues in fruits using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with analyte protectants to compensate for matrix effects].,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22715692,2014

A protocol for the collection of liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray ionization (ESI)-quadruple linear ion trap (Q-LIT) mass spectrometry (MS) library spectra was developed. Following the protocol, an enhanced product ion (EPI) library of 240 pesticides was developed by use of spectra collected from two laboratories. A LC-Q-LIT-MS workflow using scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) survey scan, information-dependent acquisition (IDA) triggered collection of EPI spectra, and library search was developed and tested to identify the 240 target pesticides in one single LC-Q-LIT MS analysis. By use of LC retention time, one sMRM survey scan transition, and a library search, 75-87% of the 240 pesticides were identified in a single LC/MS analysis at fortified concentrations of 10 ng/g in 18 different foods. A conventional approach with LC-MS/MS using two MRM transitions produced the same identifications and comparable quantitative results with the same incurred foods as the LC-Q-LIT using EPI library search, finding 1.2-49 ng/g of either carbaryl, carbendazim, fenbuconazole, propiconazole, or pyridaben in peaches; carbendazim, imazalil, terbutryn, and thiabendazole in oranges; terbutryn in salmon; and azoxystrobin in ginseng. Incurred broccoli, cabbage, and kale were screened with the same EPI library using three LC-Q-LIT and a LC-quadruple time-of-flight (Q-TOF) instruments.

This study examines the toxic effect and subcellular location of cadmium telluride (CdTe) QDs with different sizes against yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The innovative approach is based on the combination of microcalorimetric, spectroscopic, electrochemical, and microscopic methods, which allows analysis of the toxic effect of CdTe QDs on S. cerevisiae and its mechanism. According to the values of the half inhibitory concentration (IC(50)), CdTe QDs exhibit marked cytotoxicity in yeast cells at concentrations as low as 80.81 nmol L(-1) for green-emitting CdTe QDs and 17.07 nmol L(-1) for orange-emitting CdTe QDs. QD-induced cell death is characterized by cell wall breakage and cytoplasm blebbing. These findings suggest that QDs with sizes ranging from 4.1 to 5.8 nm can be internalized into yeast cells, which then leads to QD-induced cytotoxicity.

22608778,"In this work, the capability of gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) for quantitative analysis of pesticide residues has been evaluated. A multiclass method for rapid screening of pesticides (insecticides, acaricides, herbicides and fungicides) in fruit and vegetable matrices has been developed and validated, including detection, identification and quantification of the analytes. To this aim, several food matrices were selected: high water content (apples, tomatoes and carrots), high acid content (oranges) and high oil content (olives) samples. The well known QuEChERS procedure was applied for extraction of pesticides, and matrix-matched calibration using relative responses versus internal standard was used for quantification. The sample extracts were analyzed by GC-TOF MS. Up to five ions using narrow window (0.02 Da)-extracted ion chromatograms at the expected retention time were monitored using a target processing method. The most abundant ion was used for quantification while the remaining ones were used for confirmation of the analyte identity. Method validation was carried out for 55 analytes in the five sample matrices tested at three concentrations (0.01, 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg). Most recoveries were between 70% and 120% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20% at 0.05 and 0.5mg/kg. At 0.01 mg/kg, roughly half of the pesticides could be satisfactorily validated due to sensitivity limitations of GC-TOF MS, which probably affected the ion ratios used for confirmation of identity. In the case of olive samples, results were not satisfactory due to the high complexity of the matrix. An advantage of TOF MS is the possibility to perform a non-target investigation in the samples by application of a deconvolution software, without any additional injection being required. Accurate-mass full-spectrum acquisition in TOF MS provides useful information for analytes identification, and has made feasible in this work the discovery of non-target imazalil, fluoranthene and pyrene in some of the samples analyzed.",Journal of chromatography.

All bands visible in the SDS-PAGE profile of each type of honey were eluted, digested and identified by mass spectrometry in a LTQ-XL instrument. It turned out that all proteins identified (except one, the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) were not of plant origin but belonged to the Apis mellifera proteome. Among the total proteins identified (eight, but only seven as basic constituents of all types of honey) five belonged to the family of major royal jelly proteins 1-5, and were also the most abundant ones in any type of honey, together with α-glucosidase and defensin-1.

22242791,"Insecticides are commonly used around homes for controlling insects such as ants, termites, and spiders. Such uses have been linked to pesticide contamination and toxicity in urban aquatic ecosystems. Fipronil is a relatively new and popular urban-use insecticide that has acute toxicity to arthropods at low-ppb levels. In this study, we collected runoff water from 6 large communities, each consisting of 152 to 460 single-family homes, in Sacramento County and Orange County, California, and evaluated the occurrence of fipronil and its biologically active derivatives over 26 months under dry weather conditions. Statistical modeling showed that the levels of fipronil and derivatives in the runoff water were both spatially and temporally correlated. More than 10-fold differences were observed between the Sacramento and Orange County sites, with the much higher levels for Orange County (southern California) coinciding with heavier use. The median concentrations of combined fipronil and derivatives for the Orange County sites were 204-440 ng L(-1), with the 90th percentile levels ranging from 340 to 1170 ng L(-1). These levels frequently exceeded the LC50 values for arthropods such as mysid shrimp and grass shrimp. The highest levels occurred from April to October, while decreases were seen from October to December and from January to March, likely reflecting seasonal use patterns and the effect of rain-induced washoff. Fipronil and fipronil sulfone (oxidation derivative) each accounted for about 35% of the total concentrations, with desulfinyl fipronil (a photolytic product) contributing about 25%. Results of this study clearly established residential drainage as a direct source for pesticide contamination in urban waterways, and for the first time, identified fipronil as a new and widespread contaminant with potential ecotoxicological significance.",Environmental science & technology,"['D002140', 'D002947', 'D004784', 'D005618', 'D008401', 'D015233', 'D010573', 'D011720', 'D014874']","['California', 'Cities', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Fresh Water', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Models, Statistical', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Pyrazoles', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Occurrence of fipronil and its biologically active derivatives in urban residential runoff.,"[None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22242791,2012

No additional organic solvents, water, surfactants, or templating agents are required. Depending on the synthetic conditions, the selective manufacturing of 0D, 1D, and 2D ZnO nanostructures is possible: Whereas the formation of rodlike structures is typically favored, ZnO nanoparticles can be obtained either under strongly basic conditions or by use of ILs with a long alkyl chain, such as 1-n-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([C(n)mim][Tf(2)N]; n>8). A short ultrasound irradiation time favors the formation of ZnO nanosheets. Prolonged irradiation leads to the conversion of the ZnO nanosheets into nanorods. In contrast, ionothermal synthesis (conventional heating) does not allow for morphology tuning by variation of the IL or other synthesis conditions, as the longer reaction times required lead always to the formation of well-developed hexagonal nanocrystals with prismatic tips. The ZnO nanostructures synthesized by using ultrasound were efficient photocatalysts in the photodegradation of methyl orange.

Extraction was performed with acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, applying modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) methodology. LC-MS/MS conditions including composition of mobile phases and mass spectrometry (MS) conditions were evaluated to achieve the highest sensitivity in MS detection. All of the data acquisition was employed in the segmented multiple-reaction monitoring mode for the selected negative and positive transition ions. The octadecylsilyl (C18) dispersive solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbent was found to provide the more satisfied recoveries than primary secondary amine (PSA) and graphitized carbon black (GCB) for five target PGRs.

We have examined the possibility of distinguishing different commercial cyanide samples through the δ(13)C and δ(15)N values and developed a protocol for the isotope analysis of cyanide extracted from several matrices as food and medicine. Several cyanide precipitates were tested for the isotope analysis. The results show that cupric ferrocyanide Cu(2)[Fe(CN)(6)] is the most appropriate precipitate for the analysis. Thirteen batches of KCN and nine batches of NaCN chemicals were randomly chosen from different suppliers. The cyanides were converted to cupric ferrocyanide and then analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry coupled to elemental analysis (EA-IRMS). The isotopic signature of the commercial samples varied from -51.96 to -25.77 ‰ for δ(13)C and from -4.51 to +3.81 ‰ for δ(15)N, highlighting the potential of applying EA-IRMS technique to identify cyanide from different batches and sources. The influence of the cyanide extraction and isolation from spiked matrix on the isotopic analysis was also studied. Three matrices: orange juice, yogurt drink and a medicine were tested. In many cases, the isotopic analysis results obtained from the original cyanides precipitates and those isolated from the matrices showed a good accordance, especially for δ(15)N. In some matrices, the (13)C analysis was interfered by co-precipitates.

21892448,"We describe a rapid in situ method for detecting agrochemicals on the surface or in the tissue of fruit using a portable mass spectrometer equipped with an ambient ionization source. Two such ionization methods, low temperature plasma (LTP) and paper spray (PS), were employed in experiments performed at a local grocery store. LTP was used to detect diphenylamine (DPA) directly from the skin of apples in the store and those treated after harvest with DPA were recognized by MS and MS/MS. These data therefore allowed ready distinction between organic and non-organic apples. DPA was also found within the internal tissue of purchased apples and its distribution was mapped using LTP. Similarly, thiabendazole residues were detected on the skin of treated oranges in a grocery store experiment in which paper spray was performed by wiping the orange surface with a moist commercial lens wipe and then applying a high voltage to ionize the chemicals directly from the wipe. The handheld mass spectrometer used in these measurements is capable of performing several stages of tandem mass spectrometry (up to MS(5)); the compounds on the fruit were identified by their MS/MS fragmentation patterns. Protonated DPA (m/z 170) produced a characteristic MS(2) fragment ion at m/z 92, while thiabendazole was identified by MS(3) using precursor to fragment ion transitions m/z 202 →m/z 175 →m/z 131.

A novel, simple, low-cost and fast method was developed and validated for trace residue extraction of pesticides, dioxin-like PCBs and PAHs from water and water based samples followed by analysis through gas chromatography (GC) coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToFMS). The extraction solvent type, volume; sample volume and other extraction conditions were optimized. This was achieved by extracting 10 mL sample with 250 μL chloroform by vortexing (1 min, standing time of 2 min) followed by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 5 min). The bottom organic layer (200 μL) was pipetted out, evaporated to near dryness and reconstituted in 20 μL of ethyl acetate+cyclohexane (1:9) mixture resulting in an enrichment factor of 400. The recoveries of all compounds were within 76-120% (±10%) with the method detection limit (MDL) ranging from 1 to 250 ng/L depending on the analyte response. The MDLs were 400 times lower than the instrument quantification limits that ranged from 0.4 to 100 ng/mL. The method was further validated in water based drinks (e.g. apple, lemon, pineapple, orange, grape and pomegranate juice). For the juices with suspended pulp, the extraction was carried out with 400 μL chloroform. The extract was analyzed by GC-ToFMS at both 1D and GC×GC modes to chromatographically separate closely eluting interfering compounds the effect of which could not be minimized otherwise. The resulting peak table was filtered to identify a range of compounds belonging to specific classes viz. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated, brominated, and nitro compounds.

The phenomenon of ion suppression can lead to errors in the quantification of the analytes of interest, as well as can affect detection capability, precision, and accuracy of the method. Sample dilution is an easy and effective method to reduce interfering compounds, and so, to diminish matrix effects. In this work, matrix effects of 53 pesticides in three different matrices (orange, tomato and leek) were evaluated. Several dilutions of the matrix were tested in order to study the evolution of signal suppression. Dilution of the extracts led to a reduction of the signal suppression in most of the cases. A dilution factor of 15 demonstrated to be enough to eliminate most of the matrix effects, opening the possibility to perform quantification with solvent based standards in the majority of the cases.

21535724,"In recent years, the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables has greatly increased, and so has its association with contamination of several foodborne pathogens (Listeria, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli). Hence, there is a need to investigate effective sanitizer systems for produce decontamination. Chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)), a strong oxidizing gas with broad spectrum and sanitizing properties, has previously been studied for use on selected fruits and vegetables. ClO(2) gas treatments show great potential for surface pathogen reduction; however its use from a residue safety standpoint has yet to be assessed. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate residues of ClO(2), chlorite, chlorate, and chloride on selected fresh produce surfaces after treatment with ClO(2) gas. A rinse procedure was used and water samples were analyzed by N, N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine and ion chromatography method (300.0). Seven different foods--tomatoes, oranges, apples, strawberries, lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, and cantaloupe--were analyzed after ClO(2) treatment for surface residues.

21535519,"The carotenoid patterns of fully ripe fruits from 12 Bolivian accessions of the Andean peppers Capsicum baccatum (ají) and C. pubescens (rocoto) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-photodiode array detector (PDA)-mass spectrometry (MS). We include 2 California Wonder cultivars as C. annuum controls. A total of 16 carotenoids were identified and differences among species were mostly found at the quantitative level. Among red-fruited genotypes, capsanthin was the main carotenoid in the 3 species (25% to 50% contribution to carotenoid fraction), although ajíes contained the lowest contribution of this carotenoid. In addition, the contribution of capsanthin 5,6-epoxide to total carotenoids in this species was high (11% to 27%) in comparison to rocotos and red C. annuum. Antheraxanthin and violaxanthin were, in general, the next most relevant carotenoids in the red Andean peppers (6.1% to 10.6%). Violaxanthin was the major carotenoid in yellow-/orange-fruited genotypes of the 3 species (37% to 68% total carotenoids), although yellow rocotos were characterized by lower levels (<45%). Cis-violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and lutein were the next most relevant carotenoids in the yellow/orange Andean peppers (5% to 14%). As a whole, rocotos showed the highest contributions of provitamin A carotenoids to the carotenoid fraction. In terms of nutritional contribution, both ajíes and rocotos provide a remarkable provitamin A activity, with several accessions showing a content in retinol equivalents higher than California Wonder controls. Furthermore, levels of lutein in yellow/orange ajíes and rocotos were clearly higher than California Wonder pepper (≥1000 μg·100/g). Finally, the Andean peppers, particularly red ajíes, can be also considered as a noticeable source of capsanthin, the most powerful antioxidant compound among pepper carotenoids. Practical Application: Capsicum peppers are known for their content in carotenoids, although there is no information about 2 species with Andean origin: ajíes and rocotos.

21514607,"A comprehensive study on morphology and biochemical compounds of 32 Capsicum spp. accessions has been performed. Accessions represented four pepper species, Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, Capsicum chinense and Capsicum baccatum which were selected by their variation in morphological characters such as fruit color, pungency and origin. Major metabolites in fruits of pepper, carotenoids, capsaicinoids (pungency), flavonoid glycosides, and vitamins C and E were analyzed and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that composition and level of metabolites in fruits varied greatly between accessions and was independent of species and geographical location. Fruit color was determined by the accumulation of specific carotenoids leading to salmon, yellow, orange, red and brown colored fruits. Levels of both O- and C-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin and apigenin varied strongly between accessions. All non-pungent accessions were devoid of capsaicins, whereas capsaicinoid levels ranged from 0.07 up to 80 mg/100g fr. wt. in fruit pericarp. In general, pungent accessions accumulated the highest capsaicinoid levels in placenta plus seed tissue compared to pericarp. The non-pungent capsaicinoid analogs, capsiates, could be detected at low levels in some pungent accessions. All accessions accumulated high levels of vitamin C, up to 200 mg/100g fr. wt. The highest vitamin E concentration found was 16 mg/100g fr. wt.

21452898,"Quantitative method validation is a well-established process to demonstrate trueness and precision of the results with a given method. However, an assessment of qualitative results is also an important need to estimate selectivity and devise criteria for chemical identification when using the method, particularly for mass spectrometric analysis. For multianalyte analysis, automatic instrument software is commonly used to make initial qualitative identifications of the target analytes by comparison of their mass spectra against a database library. Especially at low residue levels in complex matrices, manual checking of results is typically needed to correct the peak assignments and integration errors, which is very time-consuming. Low-pressure gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (LP-GC-MS) has been demonstrated to increase the speed of analysis for GC-amenable residues in various foods and provide more advantages over the traditional GC-MS approach. LP-GC-MS on a time-of-flight (ToF) instrument was used, which provided high sample throughput with <10 min analysis time. The method had already been validated to be acceptable quantitatively for nearly 150 pesticides, and in this study of qualitative performance, 90 samples in total of strawberry, tomato, potato, orange, and lettuce extracts from the QuEChERS sample preparation approach were analyzed. The extracts were randomly spiked with different pesticides at different levels, both unknown to the analyst, in the different matrices. Automated software evaluation was compared with human assessments in terms of false-positive and -negative results. Among the 13590 possible permutations with 696 blind additions made, the automated software approach yielded 1.2% false presumptive positives with 23% false negatives, whereas the analyst achieved 0.8% false presumptive positives and 17% false negatives for the same analytical data files. False negatives frequently occurred due to challenges at the lowest concentrations, but 70% of them involved certain pesticides that degraded (e.g., captafol, folpet) or otherwise could not be detected. The false-negative rate was reduced to 5-10% if the problematic analytes were excluded. Despite its somewhat better performance in this study, the analyst approach was extremely time-consuming and would not be practical in high sample throughput applications for so many analytes in complicated matrices.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D005506', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D010573', 'D014675']","['Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Vegetables']","Qualitative aspects in the analysis of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables using fast, low-pressure gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.","['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21452898,2011

Ricin added to beverage matrices was extracted using antibody-bound magnetic beads and digested with trypsin. Absolute quantification was performed using isotope dilution mass spectrometry with a linear ion trap operating in product-ion-monitoring mode. The method allows for identification of ricin A chain and B chain and for distinction of ricin from ricin agglutinin within a single analytical run. Ricin-bound beads were also tested for deadenylase activity by incubation with a synthetic ssDNA oligomer. Depurination of the substrate by ricin was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS).

In addition, two other pyrrolylsulfinyl derivatives were found in an extract from the bulbs, namely, 3-(2-pyrrolylsulfinyl)lactic acid and S-(3-pyrrolyl)cysteine S-oxide. Contrary to a previous report, the latter compound was shown not to serve as the precursor of the pigment, being in fact only an artifact formed during isolation. The formation of pyrrolyl-containing compounds following disruption of A. giganteum bulbs was studied by a combination of LC-MS, LC-NMR and DART-MS. It was found that S-(2-pyrrolyl)cysteine S-oxide is cleaved by a C-S lyase (alliinase) to yield 2-pyrrolesulfenic acid. Two molecules of the latter compound give rise to highly reactive S-(2-pyrrolyl) 2-pyrrolethiosulfinate which in turn converts into red 2,2'-epidithio-3,3'-dipyrrole (dipyrrolo[2,3-d:2',3'-e]-1,2-dithiin).

21238751,"For this work, thirteen types of fruit juices (orange, pineapple, peach, apple, multifruit, mango, strawberry, tomato, pear, mandarin, grape, banana and grapefruit) were selected to develop an analytical method for the analysis of 53 pesticides by direct injection in LC-MS/MS. The preparation of the samples was very simple: an aliquot of the juice was centrifuged and it was ten-times diluted prior to analysis, which allowed reducing considerably the time and cost of the analyses. Besides, dilution of the samples permits reducing the amount of matrix going into the system, and thus, decreasing the matrix effects, so common in this type of commodities, opening the possibility to perform quantification with solvent based standards. Validation of the method was carried out in accordance with EU guidelines. Calibration curves covering three orders of magnitude were performed, and they were linear over the concentration range studied for all the matrices (from 0.1 to 100 μg L(-1)). Practical limits of quantification were in the low μg L(-1) range, far below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) of the EU regulations, which do not set specific MRLs for juices, and in this cases of processed food, MRLs of the raw product are applied. Repeatability of the instrumental method was studied in all matrices, obtaining good intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs). The proposed method was applied to 106 real fruit juice samples purchased in different local markets during a one-year survey in order to validate the suitability for routine analysis. 43% of the analysed samples gave positive results (higher than the practical limits of quantification).",Talanta,"['D001628', 'D002853', 'D005060', 'D005638', 'D010573', 'D010865', 'D053719']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Europe', 'Fruit', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Pilot Projects', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Pesticide residue analysis of fruit juices by LC-MS/MS direct injection.

30743679,"In northern Italy, blue mold can occur generally on apples after 3 months of storage under controlled atmospheres. The mold can be caused by Penicillium griseofulvum Dierckx (synonym P. urticae Bainier). During 2008, several postharvest fruit rots were observed on apples (cv. Golden Delicious) after 180 to 240 days of storage at 1°C. Approximately 8% of the fruits showed blue mold. Apples had been cultivated in Aosta (Aosta Valley Region) and Lagnasco (Piedmont Region). Infected fruits showed soft, watery, brown spots enlarging rapidly at 20°C. There was a distinct margin between soft rotted flesh and firm healthy tissues. Under high humidity, masses of blue-green spores formed on the surface of the lesion. Apple fruit excisions from the margin between the healthy and diseased tissues were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), pH 5.6. The recovered fungus produced abundant mycelium and conidia, with the colonies attaining a diameter of 2.0 to 2.4 cm after 7 days at 20 ± 2°C on PDA. Colonies were mostly yellow-green, with a yellowish-to-orange brown underside. Conidiophores were mononematous or loosely synnematous, hyaline, with branches strongly divergent. Phialides were cylindrical with a very short neck. Conidia were ellipsoidal, sometimes subglobose, 2.5 to 3.5 × 2.2 to 2.5 μm, hyaline to greenish. Preliminary morphological identification of the fungus (2) was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from mycelia of pure cultures. Two sequences, obtained through the amplification of ribosomal region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (1), were blast searched in GenBank and showed 99% sequence coverage and 99% similarity to ribosomal sequences of P. griseofulvum. Two sequences were deposited in GenBank with Accession Nos. HQ012498 (a strain from Aosta Valley) and HQ012499 (a strain from the Piedmont Region). Pathogenicity was tested on 20 ripe fruits each of four apple cultivars (Golden Delicious, Red Chief, Granny Smith, and Royal Gala). Fruits were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Conidial suspensions (30 μl of 105 conidia/ml) of the fungus were placed on artificial wounds generated on the apple surface. Control fruits were treated with sterile water. Seven days after inoculation, the symptoms were reproduced on the four cultivars and P. griseofulvum was reisolated on PDA from the inoculated fruits of all four cultivars. Control fruits were symptomless. An analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array of the rotting tissues associated with inoculated fruits of all four cultivars (4) confirmed, as in the case of other strains of P. griseofulvum, the production of the mycotoxin patulin (12.1 to 44.4 mg kg",Plant disease,[],[],First Report of Penicillium griseofulvum Causing Blue Mold on Stored Apples in Italy (Piedmont).,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30743679,2019
21147342,"Rapid analytical method for the simultaneous separation and determination of amines and organic acids is a vital interest for quality control of citrus and their products. In the present study, a simultaneous high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the rapid separation of three amines and two organic acids was developed. Chromatographic separation of compounds was achieved using Xbridge C(18) column at ambient temperature, with an isocratic mobile phase of 3mM phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min(-1). A photodiode array (PDA) detector was used to monitor the eluent at 223 nm and 254 nm with a total analysis time of 10 min. Extraction of amines and organic acids from citrus juice was optimized. The method was validated by tests of linearity, recovery, precision and ruggedness. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for amines and ascorbic acid were determined to be 5 ng and 9.8 ng, respectively. All calibration curves showed good linearity (R(2) ≥ 0.9999) within the test ranges. The recoveries of the amines and organic acids ranged between 84% and 117%. The identity of each peak was confirmed by mass spectral (MS) analysis. The developed method was successfully applied to analyze the content of amines and organic acids in six different species and two varieties of citrus. Results indicate that mandarin and Marrs sweet orange contain high level of amines, while pummelo and Rio Red grapefruit had high content of ascorbic acid (137-251 μg mL(-1)) and citric acid (5-22 mg mL(-1)). Synephrine was the major amine present in Clementine (114 μg mL(-1)) and Marrs sweet orange (85 μg mL(-1)).

The method uses a specific food category-based cleanup/treatment procedure before color extraction to avoid the interference of food matrixes, and to obtain the optimal color extraction. Analysis was performed on a reversed-phase C18 micro-Bondapak column with ammonium acetate and acetonitrile gradient elution as the mobile phase; a programmable lamda max-specific visible detection was used to monitor colors to obtain the higher sensitivity and expanded scope needed for multicolor blends having diverse absorption maxima. All colors showed good linearity, with regression coefficients of 0.9974-0.9999. The LOD and LOQ values ranged from 0.01 to 0.12 mg/L, and from 0.04 to 0.83 mg/L or mg/kg, respectively. The intraday and interday precision tests produced good RSD values, and the recoveries from different food matrixes ranged from 82 to 104%.

Levels of anthocyanins and artificial colours were determined by HPLC with UV-Vis detection in red orange juices and other red beverages (nectar, juice-based, health, carbonated and sports drinks). The contribution of pigments to the visible colour of the beverage was calculated. Red orange juice samples contained about 34 mg l(-1) of anthocyanins, which were responsible for about 92% of the visible colour. Red juice-based drinks, containing from 0% to 30% of red orange, berry, grape or pomegranate juices, had low levels of anthocyanins (about 7 mg l(-1)) and high levels of E129 (about 32 mg l(-1)), which were responsible for about 90.7% of the colour of these beverages. Red health drinks, enriched with vitamins and polyphenols, contained from 3% to 50% of red fruit juices. Also in this case the E129 levels were higher (about 22 mg l(-1)) than anthocyanins (about 9 mg l(-1)), and were responsible for the colour of the beverages (76.1%). High levels of artificial colours were found in red orange carbonated drinks, but in comparable amounts with those found in the other beverage samples, while anthocyanins were only present in trace amounts. Although all of the beverages claimed to contain red fruits on the labels, no correlation was found between the level of anthocyanins and the declared percentage of red fruits. These labels generally conformed with the requirements of the law, but food product labels can often be misleading to consumers about the real characteristics of the product.","Food additives & contaminants.

Response surface methodology, which is commonly used to optimize growth conditions for food microorganisms to maximize product(s) yield, was used to determine the optimal conditions for chromate reduction and dye decolourization by B. casei. The optimal conditions were 0.24 g/L glucose, 3.0 g/L (NH(4))(2)SO(4) and 0.2 g/L peptone at pH 7 and 35 degrees C. The predicted maximum chromate reduction efficiencies and dye decolourization were 83.4+/-0.6 and 40.7+/-1.7%, respectively. A new mechanism was proposed for chromate reduction coupling with AO7 decolourization by B. casei. Under nutrient-limiting condition, AO7 was used as an e(-) donor by the reduction enzyme(s) of B. casei for the reduction of Cr(VI). The resulted Cr(III) then complexed with the oxidized AO7 to form a purple coloured intermediate.",Journal of hazardous materials,"['D001391', 'D001951', 'D002840', 'D003116', 'D004396', 'D003470', 'D004583', 'D006358', 'D006863', 'D013058', 'D010084', 'D013054']","['Azo Compounds', 'Brevibacterium', 'Chromates', 'Color', 'Coloring Agents', 'Culture Media', 'Electrons', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",Simultaneous chromate reduction and azo dye decolourization by Brevibacterium casei: azo dye as electron donor for chromate reduction.,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","['metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20656406,2010

20641006,"The potential applications of a new atmospheric pressure source for GC-MS analysis have been investigated in this work. A list of around 100 GC-amenable pesticides, which includes organochlorine, organophosphorus and organonitrogenated compounds, has been used to evaluate their behavior in the new source. Favoring the major formation of the molecular ion in the source has been the main goal due to the wide-scope screening possibilities that this fact brings in comparison with the traditional, highly fragmented electron ionization spectra. Thus, the addition of water as modifier has been tested as a way to promote the generation of protonated molecules. Pesticides investigated have been classified into six groups according to their ionization/fragmentation behavior. Four of them are characterized by the abundant formation of the protonated molecule in the atmospheric pressure source, mostly being the base peak of the spectrum. These results show that wide-scope screening could be easily performed with this source by investigating the presence of the protonated molecule ion, MH+. The developed procedure has been applied to pesticide screening in different food samples (nectarine, orange and spinach) and it has allowed the presence of several pesticides to be confirmed such as chlorpyriphos ethyl, deltamethrin and endosulfan sulfate. The availability of a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument made it feasible to perform additional MS/MS experiments for both standards and samples to go further in the confirmation of the identity of the detected compounds.

20560532,"A novel cyanide analyzer based on sensitive cobinamide chemistry relies on simultaneous reagent and sample injection and detection in a 50 cm liquid core waveguide (LCW) flow cell illuminated by a white light emitting diode. The transmitted light is read by a fiber-optic charge coupled device (CCD) spectrometer. Alkaline cobinamide (orange, lambda(max) = 510 nm) changes to violet (lambda(max) = 583 nm) upon reaction with cyanide. Multiwavelength detection permits built-in correction for artifact responses intrinsic to a single-line flow injection system and corrects for drift. With optimum choice of the reaction medium, flow rate, and mixing coil length, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) is 30 nM and the linear dynamic range extends to 10 microM. The response base width for 1% carryover is <95 s, permitting a throughput of 38 samples/h. The relative standard deviations (rsd) for repetitive determinations at 0.15, 0.5, and 1 microM were 7.6% (n = 5), 3.2% (n = 7), and 1.7% (n = 6), respectively.

The colors of the quinone clips result from broad absorption bands in the visible range (1, lambda(max) = 537 nm and 2, lambda(max) = 423 and lambda(shoulder) =515 nm) showing bathochromic shifts of 112 and 90 nm, respectively, compared to the similarly tetraalkyl-substituted duroquinone 31, even though the clips 1 and 2 only contain insulated pi systems as chromophores, a central tetraalkyl-substituted p-benzoquinone spacer-unit and two anthracene or two naphthalene sidewalls. To elucidate the electronic properties of these clips, we prepared the compound 3, the anti-configured isomer of clip 2, and the benzene-, naphthalene-, and anthracene-substituted quinones 4, 5, and 6, the so-called ""half-clips"". The ""half-clips"" 6 and 5 show a similar color change and the same trend in the UV/vis absorption spectra as the anthracene and naphthalene clip 1 and 2. This finding already rules out that the color of these systems is a result of ""through-space"" pi-pi interactions between the aromatic sidewalls in the molecular clips 1 and 2. Quantum chemical ab initio calculations provide good evidence that the bathochromic shift of the absorption band at the longest wavelength observed in the UV/vis spectra of the clip quinones 2, 3, and 1 and the ""half-clip"" quinones 4, 5, and 6 with an increasing number of rings in the anellated aromatic unit (from benzene to anthracene) is the result of an increasing configuration interaction between a n --> pi* excitation of the quinoid component and a pi --> pi* excitation with intramolecular charge transfer (CT) character. The initial pi orbitals involved here and in higher lying transitions mainly stem from through-space interactions between pi orbitals of the aromatic sidewalls and pi orbitals of the quinone moiety with varying degree of mixing. The configuration interaction in the excited states can be considered to be a homoconjugation, that is, the relevant charge transfer states are formed across an allegedly insulating aliphatic bridge.

20449223,"Dialkylphosphates (DAPs) are urinary metabolites and breakdown products of organophosphorous (OP) pesticides. Urinary DAPs are widely used to assess exposure to OP pesticides in epidemiologic studies. Recent evidence suggests that preformed DAPs are present in food and that they may also be present in other parts of the environment. Thus, DAP concentrations observed in urine may reflect a person's exposure to both parent OP pesticides and preformed DAPs in food and other environmental media. The presence of preformed DAPs in multiple media may indicate that previous studies have overestimated exposure to OP pesticides and that the use of urinary DAPs as biomarkers of exposure for OP pesticides may not accurately characterize exposure in non-acute settings. To establish the presence of DAPs in environmental and food media, we developed analytical methods to measure six DAPs in dust and orange juice. The limits of detection (LOD) for the dimethyl phosphates (dimethylphosphate (DMP), dimethylthiophosphate, and dimethyldithiophosphate) ranged from 2.8-9.9 ng g(-1) and 0.2-0.4 ng mL(-1) in dust and juice, respectively. The LODs for the diethyl phosphates (diethylphosphate (DEP), diethylthiophosphate, diethyldithiophosphate) ranged from 5.2-10.4 ng g(-1) and 0.5-3.0 ng mL(-1) in dust and juice, respectively. The extraction efficiencies for the analytes ranged from 23% to 91% and from 41% to 85% in dust and orange juice, respectively. DMP was detected in about half of the dust samples whereas DEP was detected in 80% of the dust samples tested. Other DAPs were less frequently detected in dust. Less than 3% of intact pesticide present in the matrices was converted to their respective DAPs during the pre-analytic and analytic process.

The single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses of all three ligands are reported in which crystals of L(1) were obtained as both syn and anti conformers and showed the conformational freedom of the two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) units. L(1)-L(3) are studied extensively toward their applicability in the colorimetric sensing of metal ions in solution. The solution-state study of mono- and bis(thiomethoxy)ferrocenylchalcone-functionalized ligands L(1) and L(2) showed selective colorimetric sensing for Hg(2+) over Li(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Cr(2+), Mn(2+), Fe(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Cd(2+), and Au(3+) in acetonitrile. In both cases, a selective color change from orange to purple was observed with Hg(2+) and the resultant solution showed the appearance of a new peak at 565 nm (epsilon = 3920 M(-1) cm(-1)) for L(1) and 600 nm (epsilon = 1140 M(-1) cm(-1)) for L(2) in the UV/vis experiments. The UV/vis titration profiles of L(1) and L(2) indicate the formation of 2:1 (L(1)/Hg(2+)) and 1:1 (L(2)/Hg(2+)) initial complexations in solution. On the other hand, L(3) with thiomethoxy- and thiol-functionalized ferrocenylchalcone showed no appreciable color change with Hg(2+) under the same experimental conditions. Attempts were made to isolate single crystals of the resulting purple solution obtained in the cases of L(1) and L(2) with Hg(2+). In both cases, crystals suitable for a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study were isolated in very low yield by a layer diffusion technique. The single-crystal structural investigations demonstrated the formation of a sulfide-encapsulated mercury thiolate cuboctahedron cluster, [Hg(8)S(SCH(3))(12)](2+), upon a selective chemodosimetric desulfurization reaction between Hg(2+) and L(1) or L(2).

20399436,"This paper presents the application of ion chromatography with electrolytic eluent generation and mobile phase suppression for the direct conductimetric detection of glyphosate and its degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). The compounds were separated on a Dionex AS18 anion exchange column with a 12-40 mM KOH step gradient from 9 to 9.5 min. The effect of the suppressor current intensity on the electrostatic interaction of these amphoteric compounds with the suppressor cation exchange membranes was evaluated. A suppressor current gradient technique was proposed for the limitation of peak broadening and baseline noise, in order to improve method sensitivity and detectability. It was observed that residual sample carbonates co-eluted with AMPA when a large injection loop was installed for the low level determination of both compounds in natural waters. For this reason, glyphosate was isocratically eluted using 33 mM KOH in order to decrease analysis time within 10 min and a column clean up step using 100 mM KOH was used to ensure retention time reproducibility. The developed method was applied to the analysis of drinking and natural water and it was further successfully applied to orange samples with slight modifications. Instrumental LOD for glyphosate was 0.24 microg/L, while method LOD was 0.54 microg/L for spring waters and 0.01 mg/kg for oranges using a 1000 microL direct loop injection of the sample. Intra-day and inter-day precision (as %RSD) for water samples was 4.6% and 12% at a spiking level of 2 microg/L, and the recovery ranged from 64% to 88% depending on sample conductivity. For orange samples, the inter-day precision was 1.4% at a spiking level of 4.4 mg/kg, while overall recovery was 103%.

20338414,"The effect of different colored filters and atmospheres on photooxidation and quality in milk was studied. Pasteurized bovine milk (3.9% fat) was packed in 2 different atmospheres (air and N(2)) and exposed to light for 20 h at 4 degrees C under 8 transparent filters with different light transmission properties. The following transparent, noncolored, and colored filters based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used: noncolored (PET), noncolored with 2 different UV-block regions, yellow, green, amber, orange, and red. Control samples were stored in darkness and in a carton. Sensory evaluation showed off flavors significantly increased in milk stored under all filters compared with the control samples. Variation in atmosphere resulted in significant differences in formation of rancid flavor in milk stored under different filters. Milk samples stored in N(2) underwent the most sensory deterioration under orange and red filters, whereas milk samples stored in air were most deteriorated under noncolored filters. According to the oxidation compounds measured by gas chromatography, milk samples stored under noncolored and orange filters were highly oxidized, whereas red, green, and amber filters offered better protection against photooxidation. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to examine the degradation of photosensitizers (riboflavin, protoporphyrin, and chlorophyllic compounds) in the milk samples. Degradation of protoporphyrin and chlorophyllic compounds in N(2) correlated well with sensory properties related to photooxidation (R(2)=0.75-0.95).

Method validation results showed that all but 1 of these 191 pesticides can be analyzed by LC-MS/MS with instrument detection limits (IDL) in the parts per trillion (ppt) range. Matrix-dependent IDL studies showed that due to either the low ionization efficiency or matrix effect exerted, 14 of these 191 pesticides could not be analyzed by this method.

Direct LPME was performed without any sample pretreatment prior to the extraction, using a simple home-built equipment. A volume of 500 microL of 840 mM NaOH was added to 3 mL of orange juice in order to compensate the acidity of the samples and to adjust pH into the alkaline region. Analytes were extracted in their neutral state through a supported liquid membrane (SLM) of 2-octanone into 20 microL of a stagnant aqueous solution of 10 mM HCl inside the lumen of the hollow fiber. Subsequently, the acceptor solution was directly subjected to analysis. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used during the optimization of the extraction procedure. Working under the optimized extraction conditions, LPME effectively extracted the analytes from different orange juices, regardless of different pH or solid material (pulp) present in the sample, with recoveries that ranged between 17.0 and 33.7%. The analytical performance of the method was evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS).

The relative standard deviations of the recoveries (RSDs) ranged between 3.4 and 10.6%, which are acceptable values for a manual microextraction technique without any previous sample treatment, using a home-built equipment and working under non-equilibrium conditions (30 min extraction). Linearity was obtained in the range 0.1-10.0 microg L(-1), with r=0.999 and 0.998 for TBZ and IMZ, respectively. Limits of detection were below 0.1 microg L(-1) and are consistent with the maximum residue levels permitted for pesticides in drinking water, which is the most restrictive regulation applicable for these kinds of samples. It has been demonstrated the suitability of three-phase LPME for the extraction of pesticides from citrus juices, suppressing any pretreatment step such as filtration or removal of the solid material from the sample, that may potentially involve a loss of analyte.",Journal of chromatography.

20172528,"The gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) deconvolution reporting software (DRS) from Agilent Technologies has been evaluated for its ability as a screening tool to detect a large number of pesticides in incurred and fortified samples extracted with acetone/dichloromethane/light petroleum (Mini-Luke method). The detection of pesticides is based on fixed retention times using retention time locking (RTL) and full scan mass spectral comparison with a partly customer built automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system (AMDIS) database. The GC-MS was equipped with a programmable temperature vaporising (PTV) injector system which enables more sample to be injected. In a blind study of 52 real samples a total number of 158 incurred pesticides were found. In addition to the 85 pesticides found by manual interpretation of GC-NPD/ECD chromatograms, the DRS revealed 73 more pesticides (+46%). The DRS system also shows its potential to discover pesticides which are normally not searched for (EPN in long beans from Thailand). A spiking experiment was performed to blank matrices of apple, orange and lettuce with 177 different pesticides at concentration levels 0.02 and 0.1 mg/kg. The samples were analysed on GC-MS full scan and the AMDIS match factor was used as a mass spectral quality criterion. The threshold level of the AMDIS match factor was set at 20 to eliminate most of the false positives. AMDIS match factors from 20 up to 69 are regarded only as indication of a positive hit and must be followed by manual interpretation. Pesticides giving AMDIS match factors at > or = 70 are regarded as identified. To simplify and decrease the large amount of data generated at each concentration level, the AMDIS match factors > or = 20 was averaged (mean AMF) for each pesticide including the commodities and their replicates. Among 177 different pesticides spiked at 0.02 and 0.1 mg/kg level, the percentage of mean AMF values > or = 70 were 23% and 80%, respectively. For 531 individual detections of pesticides (177 pesticides x 3 replicates) giving AMDIS match factor 20 in apple, orange and lettuce, the detection rates at 0.02 mg/kg were 71%, 63% and 72%, respectively. For the 0.1 mg/kg level the detection rates were 89%, 85% and 89%, respectively. In real samples some manual interpretation must be performed in addition. However, screening by GC-MS/DRS is about 5-10 times faster compared to screening with GC-NPD/ECD because the time used for manual interpretation is much shorter and there is no need for re-injection on GC-MS for the identification of suspect peaks found on GC-NPD/ECD.",Journal of chromatography.

Carbendazim (CB), thiabendazole (TB) and fuberidazole (FB) were extracted in a single step and no clean-up or concentration of extracts was needed. The high extraction efficiency obtained for BFs was a result of the different types of interactions provided by the supramolecular solvent (e.g. hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds) and the high number of solubilisation sites it contains. Besides simple and efficient, the proposed extraction approach was rapid, low-cost, environment friendly and it was implemented using conventional lab equipments. The target analytes were determined in the supramolecular extract by LC/fluorescence detection. They were separated in a Kromasil C18 (5 microm, 150 mm x 4.6 mm) column using isocratic elution [mobile phase: 60:40 (v/v) 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 4)/methanol] and quantified at 286/320 nm (CB) and 300/350 nm (TB and FB) excitation/emission wavelengths, respectively.

19719125,"Citrus juices are a complex mixture of flavor and taste components. Historically, the contributions of taste components such as sugar (sweet) and acid (sour) components were understood before impactful aroma volatiles because they existed at higher concentrations and could be measured with the technologies of the 1920s and 1930s. The advent of gas chromatography in the 1950s allowed citrus researchers to separate and tentatively identify the major citrus volatiles. Additional volatiles were identified when mass spectrometry was coupled to capillary GC. Unfortunately, the major citrus volatiles were not major influences of citrus flavor. The major aroma impact compounds were found at trace concentrations. With the advent of increasingly more sensitive instrumental techniques, juice sample size shrank from 2025 L in the 1920s to 10 mL today and detection limits fell from percent to micrograms per liter. Currently gas chromatography-olfactometry is the technique of choice to identify which volatiles in citrus juices possess aroma activity, determine their relative aroma strength, and characterize their aroma quality but does not indicate how they interact together or with the juice matrix. Flavor equations based primarily on nonvolatiles and other physical measurements have been largely unsuccessful. The most successful flavor prediction equations that employ instrumental concentration values are based on a combination of aroma active volatiles and degrees Brix (sugar) values.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001628', 'D002623', 'D002849', 'D002957', 'D032083', 'D032084', 'D005511', 'D005524', 'D005638', 'D049673', 'D049674', 'D006801', 'D009812', 'D012903', 'D013649', 'D055549']","['Beverages', 'Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Citrus', 'Citrus paradisi', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Food Handling', 'Food Technology', 'Fruit', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Odorants', 'Smell', 'Taste', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Historical review of citrus flavor research during the past 100 years.,"['Q000032', 'Q000266', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000266', 'Q000266', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'history', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'history', 'history', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19719125,2010
19707680,"A C(6)-symmetric disk-like molecule, a hexakis(phenylethynyl)benzene derivative bearing chiral alanine parts, L-1, exhibited a solvent-induced supramolecular helix-sense inversion involving conformational changes followed by destruction of the supramolecular helical column. This phenomenon has been found by investigating the supramolecular assembly state of L-1 in mixed solvents of various chloroform (CHCl(3))/n-hexane (Hx) ratios. L-1 forms a stable helical columnar assembly via multiple noncovalent bonding interactions in nonpolar Hx, while the molecules in relatively polar CHCl(3) are in a molecularly dispersed state. Although one would expect disruption of the helical column with the addition of nonhelicogenic CHCl(3), an opposite-handed helical columnar structure was formed at 8-15 vol% of CHCl(3), and subsequently the inverted helical column was disassembled by a further increase of CHCl(3). In addition, this morphological transformation was accompanied by a significant change in fluorescent color, which varies over a wide visible range from orange in an original helical columnar state to light blue in a molecularly dispersed state through yellow in an inverted helical columnar state. These unprecedented behaviors are shown by the spectroscopic results, and the molecular conformations of L-1 and the driving force for the helical sense inversion are discussed.",Organic & biomolecular chemistry,"['D000042', 'D000409', 'D001554', 'D002244', 'D002942', 'D003116', 'D008968', 'D012997', 'D013050', 'D013056', 'D013237']","['Absorption', 'Alanine', 'Benzene', 'Carbon', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Color', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Solvents', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Stereoisomerism']",Solvent-induced chirality inversion involving supramolecular helix transformation and color-tunable fluorescence of a C(6)-symmetric hexakis(phenylethynyl)benzene derivative.,"[None, 'Q000031', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None]","[None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19707680,2009
19680978,"The effectiveness of heat treatments with water and cyprodinil in controlling post-harvest green mould caused by Penicillium digitatum was investigated on artificially inoculated 'Valencia' oranges. Residue levels of cyprodinil were determined in the oranges as a function of active ingredient concentration, temperature and treatment time. Cyprodinil residues were significantly dependent on treatment time when applied at 600 mg l(-1) and 20 degrees C, but not when fruit were treated at 150-300 mg l(-1). The application of cyprodinil at 50 or 100 mg l(-1) at 55 degrees C for 30 s produced similar residue levels, while residues increased when the application rate was 150 mg l(-1). Cyprodinil at 100 mg l(-1) and 60 degrees C produced a significant increase in residues compared to treatment at 50 mg l(-1); no significant increase in residues was found when the application rate was raised from 100 to 150 mg l(-1). In comparison to treatments performed at 20 degrees C, the application of a heated cyprodinil mixture resulted in significantly higher residues in fruit. All treatments with cyprodinil at 20 degrees C similarly reduced green mould after 7 days of storage at 20 degrees C. After 18 days, treatment with cyprodinil at 600 mg l(-1) for 30 s was more effective than at 150-300 mg l(-1). When dip time was extended to 90 or 180 s, treatment efficacy was positively related to fungicide concentration. Treatments with water at 55 degrees C for 30 s were as effective as cyprodinil at 50-100 mg l(-1), but less effective than cyprodinil at 150 mg l(-1). After 7 days, treatment with water or cyprodinil at 50-150 mg l(-1) and 60 degrees C were equally effective in controlling green mould; while, after 18 days, treatment with cyprodinil at 150 mg l(-1) was consistently more effective than at 50-100 mg l(-1) or hot water alone.","Food additives & contaminants.

19680977,"This paper reports the results of a 5-year study to evaluate pesticide levels, derived from orchard activities, on Italy's most common orange cultivar (Citrus sinensis, L. Osbeck, cv. Tarocco). Using a Bayesian approach, the study allowed both the qualitative (number) and quantitative distributions (amount) of pesticides to be determined with its own probability value. Multi-residue analyses of 460 samples highlighted the presence of ethyl and methyl chlorpyrifos, dicofol, etofenprox, fenazaquin, fenitrothion, imazalil, malathion and metalaxil-m. A total of 30.5% of samples contained just one pesticide, 2.16% two pesticides and 0.65% of samples had three pesticides present simultaneously. The most common residue was ethyl chlorpyrifos followed by methyl chlorpyrifos. Estimated daily intake (EDI) values for ethyl and methyl chlorpyrifos, as well as the distance from the safety level (non-observed adverse effect level, NOAEL), were calculated. The risk was differentiated (1) to take account of the period of actual citrus consumption (180 days) and (2) to discriminate the risk derived from eating oranges containing a certain level of chlorpyrifos from unspecified pesticides. The most likely EDI values for ethyl chlorpyrifos derived from Italian blood orange consumption are 0.01 and 0.006 mg/day calculated for 180 and 365 days, respectively. Considering the probability of the occurrence of ethyl chlorpyrifos, these EDI values are reduced to 2.6 x 10(-3) and 1.3 x 10(-3) mg/day, respectively. For methyl chlorpyrifos, the most likely EDI values are 0.09 and 0.04 mg/day, respectively; considering the probability of its occurrence, the EDI values decrease to 6.7 x 10(-3) and 3.4 x 10(-3) mg/day, respectively.

Residues were proportionate to the potassium sorbate concentration in the treatment solution. In oranges stored at 15 degrees C, following the potassium sorbate treatments, residues declined initially rapidly and later more slowly, until residues stopped declining after 6 days. A brief double-dip rinse in tap water applied immediately after immersion of lemons in a 2% (wt/vol) potassium sorbate removed more than 90% of the potassium sorbate residue.

There is concern, therefore, that children may not receive adequate DHA and so might benefit from dietary supplementation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of providing a supplement of microencapsulated algal DHA in juice. We assessed the effects of two levels of DHA supplementation on the plasma phospholipid DHA content of healthy 4- to 6-year-old and 7- to 12-year-old children who were randomly assigned to consume 180 mL juice containing either 50 mg (lower dose) or 100 mg (higher dose) DHA daily for 6 weeks. Plasma phospholipid DHA content (mole % of total fatty acids) was measured before and after 6 weeks of daily juice consumption. Because there are no data for plasma phospholipid DHA content in healthy children, data were compared to that of breastfed infants. At baseline, plasma phospholipid DHA content was lower in both age groups and dose groups than observed in breastfed infants. It increased significantly in both dose groups, but more so in the higher dose group of both age groups (P<0.05, overall mean+/-standard deviation: 3.72+/-0.66 vs 4.64+/-0.77); reaching levels similar to or greater than content of breastfed infants.

A salient feature of this new structural motif is that the redox-active organometallic fragment is linked to the indole rings by unsaturated nitrogen functionalities. Triad behaves as a highly selective dual-redox and chromogenic chemosensor molecule for Hg(2+) cations: the oxidation redox peak is anodically shifted (DeltaE(1/2) = 210 mV), and the low energy band of the absorption spectrum is red-shifted (Deltalambda = 120 mm), upon complexation with this metal cation. This change in the absorption spectrum is accompanied by a dramatic colour change from orange to green which allows the potential for ""naked eye"" detection.

19268963,"Photodegradation of an organic dye was studied experimentally using novel polymer-titania microcomposites. These microcomposites were prepared from titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) nanoparticles embedded within cross-linked, thermally-responsive microgels of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and contained interpenetrating linear chains of poly(acrylic acid) that functionalize the nanoparticles of TiO(2). Because these microcomposites settle more than a hundred times faster than freely suspended TiO(2) nanoparticles, they are extremely useful for simple gravity separation of the photocatalyst in applications that employ titania nanoparticles. Methyl orange (MO) was used as a model contaminant to investigate the degradation kinetics using the microcomposites in aqueous suspensions. Kinetics of the photodegradation were evaluated by monitoring the changes in methyl orange concentration using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The photocatalytic behavior of functional microcomposites containing 65 wt% titania was studied and the influence of the solution pH as well as the total titania concentration in solution was explored. The results indicated that pH of the solution changes the surface interactions between the poly(acrylic acid), titania, and methyl orange and this interplay determined the overall degradation kinetics of the chemical contaminants. Nearly identical reaction rate constants were observed in acidic solutions for the microcomposites when compared to freely suspended titania. The latter showed higher rate constants than the microcomposites at a neutral pH. Release of the titania from the microcomposites was observed under basic conditions. Complete degradation of the microcomposites was observed after prolonged (7-13 h) UV irradiation.

The leaf samples were digested and the concentrations of Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni, Cr, and Zn were then quantified by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). All three Bangkok sites were polluted with heavy metals compared with the background site. Fe was found as the highest mean concentration of the metals studied, while Pb was the lowest. There was a high correlation coefficient between metals Cu-Mn, Cu-Zn, Cu-Pb, and Mn-Zn. However, Fe was not correlated with other metals. There was no significant difference in Pb between sites. The significant difference in other metals found in the study could be attributed to different anthropogenic activities between sites.

27873917,"Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate, AA) is a water soluble organic compound that participates in many biological processes. The main aim of this paper was to utilize two electrochemical detectors (amperometric - Coulouchem III and coulometric - CoulArray) coupled with flow injection analysis for the detection of ascorbic acid. Primarily, we optimized the experimental conditions. The optimized conditions were as follows: detector potential 100 mV, temperature 25 °C, mobile phase 0.09% TFA:ACN, 3:97 (v/v) and flow rate 0.13 mL·min-1. The tangents of the calibration curves were 0.3788 for the coulometric method and 0.0136 for the amperometric one. The tangent of the calibration curve measured by the coulometric detector was almost 30 times higher than the tangent measured by the amperometric detector. Consequently, we coupled a CoulArray electrochemical detector with high performance liquid chromatography and estimated the detection limit for AA as 90 nM (450 fmol per 5 μL injection). The method was used for the determination of vitamin C in a pharmaceutical preparations (98 ± 2 mg per tablet), in oranges (Citrus aurantium) (varied from 30 to 56 mg/100 g fresh weight), in apples (Malus sp.) (varied from 11 to 19 mg/100 g fresh weight), and in human blood serum (varied from 38 to 78 μM).

18790999,"Tailoring carotenoids by plant carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) generates various bioactive apocarotenoids. Recombinant CCD1 has been shown to catalyze symmetrical cleavage of C(40) carotenoid substrates at 9,10 and 9',10' positions. The actual substrate(s) of the enzyme in planta, however, is still unknown. In this study, we have carried out RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated repression of a Medicago truncatula CCD1 gene in hairy roots colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices. As a consequence, the normal AM-mediated accumulation of apocarotenoids (C(13) cyclohexenone and C(14) mycorradicin derivatives) was differentially modified. Mycorradicin derivatives were strongly reduced to 3% to 6% of the controls, while the cyclohexenone derivatives were only reduced to 30% to 47%. Concomitantly, a yellow-orange color appeared in RNAi roots. Based on ultraviolet light spectra and mass spectrometry analyses, the new compounds are C(27) apocarotenoic acid derivatives. These metabolic alterations did not lead to major changes in molecular markers of the AM symbiosis, although a moderate shift to more degenerating arbuscules was observed in RNAi roots. The unexpected outcome of the RNAi approach suggests C(27) apocarotenoids as the major substrates of CCD1 in mycorrhizal root cells. Moreover, literature data implicate C(27) apocarotenoid cleavage as the general functional role of CCD1 in planta. A revised scheme of plant carotenoid cleavage in two consecutive steps is proposed, in which CCD1 catalyzes only the second step in the cytosol (C(27)-->C(14)+C(13)), while the first step (C(40)-->C(27)+C(13)) may be catalyzed by CCD7 and/or CCD4 inside plastids.",Plant physiology,"['D001483', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D003001', 'D017931', 'D018076', 'D049308', 'D017343', 'D013058', 'D046913', 'D008969', 'D018517', 'D034622', 'D012333', 'D020133']","['Base Sequence', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dioxygenases', 'Genes, Plant', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Medicago truncatula', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Roots', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']","RNA interference-mediated repression of MtCCD1 in mycorrhizal roots of Medicago truncatula causes accumulation of C27 apocarotenoids, shedding light on the functional role of CCD1.","[None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000235', None]","[None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, 'genetics', None, 'enzymology', None, 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18790999,2009

Previously, 10-N-nonyl acridine orange (NAO) has been used as a fluorescent probe for the visualization of CL in mitochondrial cell membranes and in solution. In this work for the determination of CL, we have synthesized two new fluorescent probes, n-tetradecyl acridine orange (C14-AO), and n-octadecyl acridine orange (C18-AO) by reacting acridine orange with the corresponding n-alkyl bromide. Using excitation and emission wavelengths at about 500 and 525 nm and varying the percentage of methanol in water as the solvent, no interaction between CL and the fluorescent probes at 75% is noted but a proportional quenching of the fluorescence signal by CL is observed at 50% or less for C14-AO and 60% or less for C18-AO. Binding efficiency of these fluorescent probes to CL is compared using dye concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 muM. C18-AO shows a better sensitivity than C14-AO and NAO, respectively, but is less selective. For C14-AO, the detection limit and limit of quantitation are 0.07 and 0.21 muM, respectively, which are better than those previously reported for NAO. One anionic PL, phosphatidic acid, shows some quenching interference to both the C14 and C18 dyes but only at concentrations above the working range for sample analysis.

18706318,"The effect of the addition of a macrocyclic host (H) such as p-sulfonatocalix[6]arene (C6S), native and modified cyclodextrins (CDs), on the fluorescence of benzoimidazolic fungicides (P), like Benomyl (BY) and Carbendazim (CZ), has been studied. The fluorescence of BY in water at pH 1.000 and 25.0 degrees C was increased in the presence of C6S, alphaCD and hydroxypropyl-beta-CD (HPCD). The association constants determined by fluorescence enhancement showed weak interactions (K(A) approximately 10(1) to 10(2) M(-1)) between the fungicide with both CDs, whereas they were stronger with C6S (K(A) approximately 10(5) M(-1)). Molecular recognition of BY for C6S was mainly attributed to electrostatic interactions, and for CDs to the hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bond formation. On the other hand, the fluorescent behaviour of CZ in the presence of C6S at pH 6.994 was interpreted as the formation of two complexes with 1:1 (P:H) and 1:2 (P:H(2)) stoichiometry, the latter being less fluorescent than the free analyte. Relative fluorescence quantum yield ratios between the complexed and free BY (phi(P:H)/phi(P)) were 2.00+/-0.05, 1.40+/-0.03 and 2.8+/-0.4 for C6S, alphaCD and HPCD, respectively. The analytical parameters improved in the presence of C6S and CDs. The best limit of detection (L(D), ng mL(-1)) was 17.4+/-0.8 with HPCD. The proposed method with C6S and HPCD was successfully applied to fortified samples of tap water and orange flesh extract with good recoveries (91-106%) and R.S.D. (< or = 2%) by triplicate analysis.

Best limits of determination (LODs) of pesticides in the fruit juices were achieved for metolcarb (1 microg/L in apple juice), carbofuran and dinoseb (2 microg/L in apple juice); for the analysis of apple skin best LODs were 10 pg/cm(2) of atrazine, metolcarb and propoxur which corresponds to an estimated concentration of 0.01 microg/kg apple, taking into account the surface area and the weight of the apple. The measured LODs were within or below the allowed maximum residue levels (MRLs) decreed by the European Union (1-500 microg/kg for pesticides in fruit juice and 0.01-5 microg/kg for apple skin). No sample pretreatment (extraction, pre-concentration, chromatographic separation) was necessary to analyze these pesticides by direct desorption/ionization using APGD-MS and to identify them using MS/MS.

18486664,"Citrus fruit and citrus fruit products, like grapefruit, lemon and marmalade were shown to contain aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists, as detected with the DR CALUX bioassay. This is of interest regarding the role of the Ah-receptor pathway in the adverse effects of dioxins, PCBs and other aromatic hydrocarbons. So far it is unclear which compounds in citrus fruit are responsible for the AhR-mediated activity and whether regular exposure to these compounds can cause effects comparable to, e.g. dioxins. The present study aimed at developing a method for identifying unknown Ah-receptor agonists in citrus products based on bioassay directed analysis, using marmalade as a first target. Following extraction with hexane and purification on an aluminium oxide-column, the extract was fractionated by HPLC using a C-18 semi-preparative column. Fractions were extracted, solvent-exchanged into dimethylsulfoxide and subsequently tested with DR CALUX. Extracts were shown to contain primarily coumarins, furocoumarins (FCs) and polymethoxyflavones (PMFs).

18383275,"A new multiresidue method has been developed and validated for the determination of more than 140 pesticide residues in cucumber and orange by gas chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QqQ-MS/MS) in a single run of 25.50 min. The triple quadrupole (QqQ) analyzer simultaneously operated in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and selected ion monitoring (SIM) modes, acquiring two or three transitions per compound. Samples were extracted by the application of a single-phase extraction of 10 g of sample with acetonitrile containing 1% of acetic acid, followed by a liquid-liquid partition formed by the addition of 4 g of MgSO(4) and 1 g of NaOAc. A dispersive solid-phase extraction (D-SPE) with primary secondary amine (PSA) was applied to clean up the extracts. A final concentration step was included in order to increase sensitivity in the instrumental analysis. The method was properly validated in each matrix in a wide dynamic range (10-400 microg kg(-1)): this work relies on a new quantification strategy by the use of two calibration curves to increase the dynamic range, which permitted reduction of sample dilutions and increase in sample throughput. Recovery was studied at three concentration levels (11.5, 50.0, and 150.0 microg kg(-1)), yielding values in the range 70-110% with precision values, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), lower than 20 and 25% for the intraday and interday precision, respectively.

Sesquiterpenes were present mainly in the rinds of climacteric varieties, and a great diversity in their composition was found among varieties. Sesquiterpenes were generally absent in non-climacteric varieties. Two climacteric melon varieties, the green-fleshed 'Noy Yizre'el', and the orange-fleshed 'Dulce' were further examined. In 'Noy Yizre'el' the main sesquiterpenes accumulated are delta-cadinene, gamma-cadinene and alpha-copaene, while alpha-farnesene is the main sesquiterpene in 'Dulce'. Sesquiterpene synthase activities, mainly restricted to rinds of mature fruits, were shown to generate different sesquiterpenes in each variety according to the compositions found in rinds. EST melon database mining yielded two novel cDNAs coding for members of the Tps gene family termed CmTpsNY and CmTpsDul respectively, that are 43.2% similar. Heterologous expression in E. coli of CmTpsNY produced mainly delta-copaene, alpha-copaene, beta-caryophyllene, germacrene D, alpha-muurolene, gamma-cadinene, delta-cadinene, and alpha-cadinene, while CmTpsDul produced alpha-farnesene only. CmTpsNY was mostly expressed in 'Noy Yizre'el' rind while CmTpsDul expression was specific to 'Dulce' rind. None of these genes was expressed in rinds of the non-climacteric 'Tam Dew' cultivar. Our results indicate that different sesquiterpene synthases encoded by different members of the Tps gene family are active in melon varieties and this specificity modulates the accumulation of sesquiterpenes. The genes are differentially transcriptionally regulated during fruit development and according to variety and are likely to be associated with chemical differences responsible for the unique aromas of melon varieties.",Plant molecular biology,"['D000595', 'D015152', 'D019755', 'D003001', 'D028463', 'D008401', 'D015971', 'D018506', 'D008969', 'D015394', 'D010802', 'D010940', 'D000081223', 'D016133', 'D011994', 'D017386', 'D012717', 'D052617', 'D013045']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carbon-Carbon Lyases', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cucumis melo', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Proteins', 'Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Species Specificity']",The molecular and biochemical basis for varietal variation in sesquiterpene content in melon (Cucumis melo L.) rinds.,"[None, None, 'Q000145', None, 'Q000201', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, None, 'classification', None, 'enzymology', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18264780,2008
18249184,"The ability to accurately quantify specific nucleic acid molecules in complex biomolecule solutions in real time is important in diagnostic and basic research. Here we describe a DNA-PNA (peptide nucleic acid) hybridization assay that allows sensitive quantification of specific nucleic acids in solution and concomitant detection of select single base mutations in resulting DNA-PNA duplexes. The technique employs so-called FIT (forced intercalation) probes in which one base is replaced by a thiazole orange (TO) dye molecule. If a DNA molecule that is complementary to the FIT-PNA molecule (except at the site of the dye) hybridizes to the probe, the TO dye exhibits intense fluorescence because stacking in the duplexes enforces a coplanar arrangement even in the excited state. However, a base mismatch at either position immediately adjacent to the TO dye dramatically decreases fluorescence, presumably because the TO dye has room to undergo torsional motions that lead to rapid depletion of the excited state. Of note, we found that the use of d-ornithine rather than aminoethylglycine as the PNA backbone increases the intensity of fluorescence emitted by matched probe-target duplexes while specificity of fluorescence signaling under nonstringent conditions is also increased. The usefulness of the ornithine-containing FIT probes was demonstrated in the real-time PCR analysis providing a linear measurement range over at least seven orders of magnitude. The analysis of two important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CFTR gene confirmed the ability of FIT probes to facilitate unambiguous SNP calls for genomic DNA by quantitative PCR.",Analytical biochemistry,"['D000483', 'D001483', 'D052160', 'D004247', 'D005456', 'D015894', 'D005998', 'D006801', 'D009952', 'D020135', 'D016133', 'D020641', 'D011804', 'D012680', 'D013050']","['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzothiazoles', 'DNA', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Genome, Human', 'Glycine', 'Humans', 'Ornithine', 'Peptide Nucleic Acids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Quinolines', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",FIT probes: peptide nucleic acid probes with a fluorescent base surrogate enable real-time DNA quantification and single nucleotide polymorphism discovery.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000235', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000031', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'genetics', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18249184,2008

18020315,"Identification of degradation products of the organophophorous pesticide fenthion formed in two orange varieties, Valencia Navel and Navel Late, under field conditions has been assessed using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ion trap mass spectrometry. The structural elucidation of the metabolites was accomplished by the accurate mass measurements provided by the quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer in MS and MS/MS modes. This instrument achieved elemental composition diagnosis for the precursor and product ions with absolute mass error of <5 ppm, which unambiguously establishes the identity of the metabolites even at low concentration. The presence of these compounds was also confirmed by electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry, performing successive fragmentation steps (MS(n)). Once identified, each molecule was confirmed by comparison with its analytical standard, also used to explore the quantitative capabilities of both mass analyzers. The extraction method was evaluated because it predetermines the metabolites that can be found (e.g., according to their polarity). Recoveries ranged from 70% for fenoxon sulfoxide (the most polar) to 101% for fenthion (the most apolar), which also indicates the method's facility to extract other more polar metabolites if present. Satisfactory linear range (r > 0.99) of more than 2 orders of magnitude was obtained with both analyzers for standards prepared in methanol and in untreated orange extracts. However, the matrix-matched standards showed suppression of the mass signal due to the matrix effect, especially for fenoxon sulfoxide and sulfone. The limits of quantification ranged from 0.005 to 0.015 mg/kg. The QqTOF-MS provided better quantification limits for fenthion and its sulfoxide and sulfone than the IT-MS. The resulting fenthion degration curves in oranges indicated that it was mainly degraded by sunlight photolysis to its sulfoxide and sulfone.

Comparisons were completed using two archetypal naphthalene-degrading bacteria: Pseudomonas putida NCIB 9816-4 and Ralstonia sp. strain U2, representative of the catechol and gentisate pathways, respectively. Strain CJ2 carries naphthalene catabolic genes that are homologous to those in Ralstonia sp. strain U2. Here we show that strain CJ2 metabolizes naphthalene via gentisate using respirometry, metabolite detection by GC-MS and cell-free enzyme assays. Unlike P. putida NCIB 9816-4 or Ralstonia sp. strain U2, strain CJ2 did not grow in minimal medium saturated with naphthalene. Growth assays revealed that strain CJ2 is inhibited by naphthalene concentrations of 78 microM (10 p.p.m.) and higher, and the inhibition of growth is accompanied by the accumulation of orange-coloured, putative naphthalene metabolites in the culture medium. Loss of cell viability coincided with the appearance of the coloured metabolites, and analysis by HPLC suggested that the accumulated metabolites were 1,2-naphthoquinone and its unstable auto-oxidation products. The naphthoquinone breakdown products accumulated in inhibited, but not uninhibited, cultures of strain CJ2. Furthermore, naphthalene itself was shown to directly inhibit growth of a regulatory mutant of strain CJ2 that is unable to metabolize naphthalene.

17909760,"The Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe multiresidue method (QuEChERS) has been validated for the extraction of 80 pesticides belonging to various chemical classes from various types of representative commodities with low lipid contents. A mixture of 38 pesticides amenable to gas chromatography (GC) were quantitatively recovered from spiked lemon, raisins, wheat flour and cucumber, and determined using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). An additional mixture of 42 pesticides were recovered from oranges, red wine, red grapes, raisins and wheat flour, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for determination. The pesticides chosen for this study included many of the most frequently detected ones and/or those that are most often found to violate the maximum residue limit (MRL) in food samples, some compounds that have only recently been introduced, as well as a few other miscellaneous compounds. The method employed involved initial extraction in a water/acetonitrile system, an extraction/partitioning step after the addition of salt, and a cleanup step utilizing dispersive solid-phase extraction (D-SPE); this combination ensured that it was a rapid, simple and cost-effective procedure. The spiking levels for the recovery experiments were 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.2 mg kg(-1) for GC-MS/MS analyses, and 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) for LC-MS/MS analyses. Adequate pesticide quantification and identity confirmation were attained, even at the lowest concentration levels, considering the high signal-to-noise ratios, the very good accuracies and precisions, as well as the good matches between the observed ion ratios.

17887667,"One of the most highlighted and fastest moving interfaces of nanotechnology is the application of quantum dots (QDs) in biology. The unparalleled advantages of the size-tunable fluorescent emission and the simultaneous excitation at a single wavelength make QDs the great possibility for use in optical encoding detection. In this paper, we report that green and orange CdTe QDs as convenient, cheap, reversible, and effective pH-sensitive fluorescent probes could monitor the proton (H+) flux driven by ATP synthesis for dual simultaneous and independent detection of viruses on the basis of antibody-antigen reactions. A new kind of biosensor (consisting of the mixture of green-QDs-labeled chromatophores and orange-QDs-labeled chromatophores) fluorescent measurement system was established for rapid, simultaneous, and independent detection of two different kinds of viruses (i.e., H9 avian influenza virus and MHV68 virus). It is crucial to find that the green and orange QDs labeled biosensors coexisting in the detection system can work independently and do not interfere with each another in the fluorescence assays. In addition, a primary steady electric double layer (EDL) model for the QDs biosensors was proposed to illustrate the mechanism of simultaneous and independent detection of the biosensors. We believe that the pH-sensitive CdTe QDs based detection system, described in this paper, is an important step toward optical encoding and has a great potential for simultaneous and independent qualitative and quantitative multiple detection systems.",The journal of physical chemistry.

This study aimed to elucidate the human metabolism of cyanidin-glucosides (CyG) contained in blood orange juice (BOJ). One liter of BOJ, containing 71 mg CyG, was consumed by 6 healthy, fasting volunteers. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at baseline and at different times up to 24 h after juice consumption. The content of native CyG, glucuronidated/methylated derivatives, and various phenolic acids was determined by HPLC/MS/MS. The serum maximal concentration of cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc) was 1.9 +/- 0.6 nmol/L and that of protocatechuic acid (PCA) was 492 +/- 62 nmol/L at 0.5 h and 2 h after juice consumption, respectively. The calculated total amounts in plasma corresponded for Cy-3-glc to 0.02% and for PCA to 44% of CyG ingested. CyG and glucuronidated/methylated metabolites, but not PCA, were detected in urine. ACN recovered in 24-h urine collections represented approximately 1.2% of the ingested dose. Both CyG (1.90 +/- 0.04 nmol/g) and PCA (277 +/- 0.2 nmol/g) were recovered in 24-h fecal samples. Data explained the metabolic fate of 74% of BOJ ACN. PCA was for the first time, to our knowledge, identified in humans as a CyG metabolite, accounting for almost 73% of ingested CyG.

17691585,"Under physiological conditions, ferric ions are essentially insoluble because of the formation of polynuclear hydroxo-bridged complexes. Ferrous ions are more soluble but may produce hydroxyl radicals on reaction with hydrogen peroxide. Chelation of ferric and ferrous ions with organic ligands may prevent these undesirable reactions. Alternatively, iron(III)-hydroxide/oxide can be stabilized and solubilized by tight interactions with carbohydrates. The data presented in this work show that, because of its physicochemical properties, the iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex (IPC, Maltofer) does not interact with the active ingredients of commonly used drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid (CAS 50-78-2), tetracycline hydrochloride (CAS 64-75-5), calcium hydrogen-phosphate (CAS 7757-93-9), methyl-L-dopa sesquihydrate (CAS 41372-08-1), and magnesium-L-aspartate hydrochloride (CAS 28184-71-6).

The objective of this study was to characterize the effect of common food additives on digestive recovery of tea catechins. Green tea water extracts were formulated in beverages providing 4.5, 18, 23, and 3.5 mg per 100 mL epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG), and epicatechin-gallate (ECG), respectively.

Samples were then subjected to in vitro digestion simulating gastric and small intestinal conditions with pre- and post-digestion catechin profiles assessed by HPLC. Catechin stability in green tea was poor with <20% total catechins remaining post-digestion. EGC and EGCG were most sensitive with less, not double equals 10% recovery. Teas formulated with 50% bovine, soy, and rice milk increased total catechin recovery significantly to 52, 55, and 69% respectively.

Due to its nonselective nature, scattering alone is not sufficient to identify analyte particles.

Fluorescence versus scattering (FVS) plots made it possible to identify two types of particles and a contaminant in a mixture of polystyrene particles.

The pathways involved in these processes are unique to plants and vary between species. Climacteric fruit ripening, especially in tomato, has been extensively studied; yet, ripening of non-climacteric fruit is poorly understood. Although the different species share common pathways; developmental programs, physiological, anatomical, biochemical composition and structural differences must contribute to the operation of unique pathways, genes and proteins. Citrus has a non-climacteric fruit ripening behavior and has a unique anatomical fruit structure. For the last few years a citrus genome-wide ESTs project has been initiated and consists of 222,911 clones corresponding to 19,854 contigs and 37,138 singletons. Taking advantage of the citrus database we analyzed the citrus proteome. Using LC-MS/MS we analyzed soluble and enriched membrane fractions of mature citrus fruit to identify the proteome of fruit juice cells.

17474521,"A collaborative study was conducted to determine multiple pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables using a quick, simple, inexpensive, and effective sample preparation method followed by concurrent analysis with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). For short, the method is known as QuEChERS, which stands for quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe. Twenty representative pesticides were fortified in 3 matrixes (grapes, lettuces, and oranges) at 3 duplicate levels unknown to the collaborators ranging from 10 to 1000 ng/g. Additionally, 8 incurred pesticide residues were determined. Thirteen laboratories from 7 countries provided results in the study, and a variety of different instruments were used by collaborators. The QuEChERS procedure simply entails 3 main steps: (1) a 15 g homogenized sample is weighed into a 50 mL centrifuge tube to which 15 mL acetonitrile containing 1% HOAc is added along with 6 g MgSO4 and 1.5 g NaOAc, and the tube is shaken and centrifuged; (2) a portion of the extract is mixed with 3 + 1 (w/w) MgSO4-primary secondary amine sorbent (200 mg/mL extract) and centrifuged; and (3) the final extract is analyzed by GC/MS and LC/MS/MS. To detect residues <10 ng/g in GC/MS, large-volume injection of 8 microL is typically needed, or the extract can be concentrated to 4 g/mL in toluene, in which case 2 microL splitless injection is used. In the study, the averaged results for data from 7-13 laboratories (not using internal standardization) for the 18 blind duplicates at the 9 spiking levels in the 3 matrixes are as follows [%recovery and reproducibility relative standard deviation (RSD(R), %)]: atrazine, 92 (18); azoxystrobin, 93 (15); bifenthrin, 90 (16); carbaryl, 96 (20); chlorothalonil, 70 (34); chlorpyrifos, 89 (25); cyprodinil, 89 (19); o,p'-DDD, 89 (18); dichlorvos, 82 (21); endosulfan sulfate, 80 (27); imazalil, 77 (33); imidacloprid, 96 (16); linuron, 89 (19); methamidophos, 87 (17); methomyl, 96 (17); procymidone, 91 (20); pymetrozine, 69 (19); tebuconazole, 89 (15); tolylfluanid (in grapes and oranges), 68 (33); and trifluralin, 85 (20).

Gradient elution has been used in conjunction with positive mode electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry to detect up to 171 pesticides and/or metabolites in different crop matrices using a single chromatographic run. Pesticide residues were extracted/partitioned from the samples with acetone/dichloromethane/light petroleum. The analytical performance was demonstrated by the analysis of extracts from lettuce, orange, apple, cabbage, grape and wheat flour, spiked at three concentration levels ranging from 0.01 to 0.10 mg/kg for each pesticide and/or metabolite. In general, recoveries ranging from 70 to 110%, with relative standard deviations better than 15%, were obtained. The recovery and repeatability data are in good accordance with EU guidelines for pesticide residue analysis.

17433246,"We have developed a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable assay for the determination of ascorbate using a plate reader. In this assay, ascorbic acid is oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid using Tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy) and then reacted with o-phenylenediamine to form the condensation product, 3-(dihydroxyethyl)furo[3,4-b]quinoxaline-1-one. The rate of appearance of this product is monitored over time using fluorescence. With this method, it is possible to analyze 96 wells in less than 10min. This permits the analysis of 20 samples with a full set of standards and blanks, all in triplicate. The assay is robust for a variety of samples, including orange juice, swine plasma, dog plasma, and cultured cells. To demonstrate the usefulness of the assay for the rapid determination of experimental parameters, we investigated the uptake of ascorbate and two different ascorbate derivatives in U937 cells. We found similar plateau levels of intracellular ascorbate at 24h for ascorbate and ascorbate phosphate. However, the intracellular accumulation of ascorbate via the phosphate ester had an initial rate that was three to five times slower than that via the palmitate ester. Only lower concentrations of the palmitate ester could be examined because the ethanol needed as solvent decreased cell viability; it behaved similarly to the other two compounds at lower concentrations. To come to these conclusions, only nine plates needed to be analyzed to provide us with the end result after only 7h of analysis. This clearly demonstrates the strength of the plate reader assay, which allows the analysis of large-sample sets in a fraction of the time required for the methods that are most commonly used today.

The application of LC-QTOF MS to real samples revealed the presence of several positives at concentrations close to the LCL, all of which were confirmed with more than 11 IPs. The potential of QTOF for elucidation of nontarget analytes has also been demonstrated by the finding of one transformation product (TP) of buprofezin in a banana skin sample.

The homogeneity of analytical samples of tomatoes processed cryogenically was much better than those processed at ambient temperature. For tomatoes, the minimum analytical portion masses required for between-analytical portion variation of < 0.3 Ho were 110 and 5 g for processing at ambient and cryogenic temperatures, respectively. Results for orange showed that analytical portion sizes of 5 g provided sufficient homogeneity from both sample processing procedures. Assessments of pesticide stability demonstrated that most were relatively stable during processing at either ambient or cryogenic temperatures. However, some pesticides, including dichlofluanid, chlorothalonil, tolylfluanid, and dicloran, appeared to suffer much greater losses (>20%) during processing at ambient temperature.

The analytical method developed consists of pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and LC-QqTOF-MS in positive ion mode, which attains unequivocal identification and quantification of the studied compounds in food, at levels well below of those of concern (0.05 mg/kg for the sum of carbosulfan, carbofuran, and 3-hydroxycarbofuran). PLE recoveries ranged from 55 to 94% with limits of quantification from 10 (for carbosulfan, carbofuran, 3-hydroxycarbofuran, and dibutylamine) to 70 microg/kg (3-keto-7-phenolcarbofuran). The method is precise, with relative standard deviations varying between 5 and 11% for the repeatability (within-day) and 8-13% for the reproducibility (interday). This method was used to monitor the presence and fate of the target compounds in orange, potato, and rice crops treated with a commercial product containing carbosulfan.

17166657,"To investigate the effects of substituent groups on the reductive degradation of azo dyes by zerovalent iron, Orange I, Orange II and Methyl Orange were selected as the model azo dyes with different substituent groups. The results showed that Orange I, Orange II and Methyl Orange could be effectively reduced by Fe(0), and the degradation of Orange I and Orange II could be described by the first-order kinetic model, while the degradation of Methyl Orange could be described by the zeroth-order kinetic model. The initial degradation rate followed the order as Orange I>Orange II>Methyl Orange under the same experimental conditions owing to the substituent effects. The degradation kinetic constants of Orange I and Orange II increased with the increase in the Fe(0) dosage, and with the decrease in the initial pH value and their initial concentration, while that of Methyl Orange increased with the decrease in the initial pH value, and with the increase in the Fe(0) dosage and their initial concentration. The results of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-mass spectra (MS) showed that sulfanilic acid was the same intermediate, while the second intermediate was 1-amino-4-naphthol for Orange I, 1-amino-2-naphthol for Orange II, and p-dimethylaminoaniline for Methyl Orange. It was suggested that the larger conjugated pi system of naphthalene rings of Orange I and Orange II for the delocalization of the nonbonding electron pairs of substituents and nitrogen in the azo bond might be favorable for the degradation of Orange I and Orange II, compared with the structure of Methyl Orange.

However, many of the new polar and thermally labile pesticides are more readily and easily analysed by LC/MS methods and no searchable libraries currently exist (with the exception of some user libraries, which are limited). Therefore, there is a need for LC/MS libraries that can detect pesticides and their degradation products. This paper reports an identification scheme using a combination of LC/MS time-of-flight (accurate mass) and an Access database of 350 pesticides that are amenable to positive ion electrospray. The approach differs from conventional library searching of fragment ions. The concept consists of three parts: (1) initial screening of possible pesticides in actual market-place fruit extracts (apple and orange) using accurate mass and generating an accurate mass via an automatic ion-extraction routine, (2) searching the Access database manually for screening identification of a pesticide, and (3) identification of the suspected compound by accurate mass of at least one fragment ion and comparison of retention time with an actual standard.

Hg2+ can catalyze H2O2 oxidizing the ion association complex [Sn(XO)6]4+.[(Fin)4]-, which causes the RTP to quench. The DeltaIp value is directly proportional to the concentration of Hg2+ in the range of 0.016-1.6 fg spot(-1) (corresponding concentration: 0.040-4.0 pg ml(-1), 0.40 microl spot(-1)), and the regression equation of working cure is DeltaIp=10.03+83.15 m Hg2+ (fg spot(-1)), (r=0.9987, n=6) and the detection limit (LD) is 3.6 ag spot(-1)(corresponding concentration: 9.0 x 10(-15) g ml(-1), the sample volume: 0.4 microl). This simple, rapid, accurate method is of high selectivity and good repeatability, and it has been successfully applied to the determination of trace mercury in real samples.

Several derivatising procedures based on the formation of an HMF silylated derivative using different reagents were studied. Among the derivatising reagents examined, N,O-bis-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) provided the best derivatisation yield. Sample clean-up was also optimised, using either liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane or solid-phase extraction (SPE) with several commercially available cartridges, and the best results were obtained using ENV+ cartridges. Quality parameters such as day-to-day and run-to-run precision (RSD<10%), linearity (between 25 and 700 ng g(-1)) and detection limit (6 ng g(-1)) were established.

The color characteristics of the fungal extracts were compared to water soluble natural colorants derived from sources currently in use. The tested fungal extracts also included some commercially available Monascus colorants. The a values for the fungal extracts were found to be both positive and negative, the b values were found to be positive, while the hue angles of the fungal color extracts ranged from 40 to 110 indicating the color distribution of fungal extracts over the red-orange-yellow region of the CIELAB color space. The fungal extracts exhibited additional color hues in the red spectrum and similar hues in the yellow spectrum as compared to the reference natural colorants. They were also found to be similar or brighter in terms of chroma to some of the reference natural colorants. Principal component analysis was performed to group and distinguish different colors based on the a and b values. The fungal color extracts could be grouped in accordance with the similarity or difference in the color to those of the existing natural colorants. The diversity of colors was not only found among different fungal genera and/or species but also within the same species on changing the media. There was a marked change in the color composition of the extracts resulting in relatively different hues. Our results, thus, indicate that there exists pigment-producing genera of ascomycetous fungi other than Monascus that produce color shades in the red and the yellow spectra in addition or similar to reference colorants.

16955880,"The solid-state speciation of arsenic (As), iron (Fe), and lead (Pb) was studied in the mine waste-derived fertilizer Ironite using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and aging studies. Arsenic was primarily associated with ferrihydrite (60-70%), with the remainder found in arsenopyrite (30-40%). Lead was observed almost exclusively as anglesite (PbSO4), with <1% observed as galena (PbS). The identification of As in oxidized Fe oxides and Pb as PbSO4 is in disagreement with the dominant reduced phases previously reported and suggests As and Pb contained within the mine waste-derived product are more bioavailable than previously considered. Aging studies in solution result in Ironite granules separating into two distinct fractions, an orange oxide precipitate and a crystalline fraction with a metallic luster. The orange oxide fraction contained As adsorbed/precipitated with ferrihydrite that is released into solution when allowed to equilibrate with water. The fraction with a metallic luster contained pyrite and arsenopyrite. A complete breakdown of arsenopyrite was observed in Ironite aged for 1 month in buffered deionized water. The observations from this study indicate As and Pb exist as oxidized phases that likely develop from the beneficiation and processing of mine tailings for commercial sale. The potential release of As and Pb has important implications for water quality standards and human health. Of particular concern is the quantity of As released from mine waste-derived products due to the new As regulation applied in 2006, limiting As levels to 10 microg L(-1) in drinking water.",Environmental science & technology,"['D000327', 'D001151', 'D001152', 'D004784', 'D005290', 'D005308', 'D007501', 'D058085', 'D007854', 'D008903', 'D010100', 'D013052', 'D015204', 'D013440', 'D013696', 'D014873', 'D014874', 'D014881']","['Adsorption', 'Arsenic', 'Arsenicals', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Ferric Compounds', 'Fertilizers', 'Iron', 'Iron Compounds', 'Lead', 'Minerals', 'Oxygen', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission', 'Spectroscopy, Mossbauer', 'Sulfides', 'Temperature', 'Water Pollutants', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Water Supply']","Mineralogy and characterization of arsenic, iron, and lead in a mine waste-derived fertilizer.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16955880,2007

HIPEF processing of orange juice is an alternative to the thermal treatment of pasteurization, provided that it is kept refrigerated, because, when the most extreme conditions of this kind of treatment are applied, the decrease in the concentration of carotenoids with vitamin A activity is very small, and also most of the carotenoids identified have a slightly increased concentration after application of the most intense treatments, although always less than in untreated fresh juice.

16815532,"Media coverage has made the public aware of both the benefits and the risks from eating self-caught fish, but information on contaminants in commercial fish is much more limited, especially on a local level. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration website provides methylmercury data for a variety of fish, but for many species sample sizes are small and data are more than a decade old, whereas commercial fish sources are highly dynamic. A few state agencies are beginning to provide contaminant information for commercial fish, including canned tuna. We examined the mercury concentration of six types of fish purchased in supermarkets in Chicago, Illinois in 2005. We measured total mercury (methylmercury accounts for about 90% of the total mercury in fish). One key question was whether the concentrations of mercury in fish available locally were similar to those reported in other areas of the country and in the FDA U.S. national data base. Such information is critical for the public, especially pregnant women or those planning on pregnancy, making decisions about types and quantities of fish to consume. Some fish are available generally throughout the U.S., but others are more locally available, suggesting a need for site-specific information. This research was stakeholder driven, and reflected local interest in the safety of local fish. There were significant differences in mercury concentrations among the fish, ranging from a mean of 0.03 microg/g (ppm-wet weight) for salmon (Salmo spp.) to 1.41 ppm for swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Maximum values for three species of fish (orange roughy Hoplostethus atianticus, swordfish walleye Sander vitreus) were over 1 ppm (FDA action level), and all of the fish except salmon had some values above 0.5 ppm, the action level set by some states and countries. There were significant differences in mercury concentrations among three types of canned tuna (Thunnus spp): ""gourmet tuna"" had the least amount of mercury, and white tuna had the most. The mean concentrations reported in this study were generally similar to those reported by the FDA, but there were important differences: 1) although the mean mercury concentrations for orange roughy for the Chicago data was similar to the FDA data, the maximum concentration was higher; 2) the mean for the Chicago swordfish was higher than the FDA data (1.26 vs 0.97 ppm, methylmercury); 3) the maximum for tuna steaks was higher in the FDA data set; and, 4) mean values for grouper (Epinephelus spp.) were higher in the FDA data set than the Chicago data. Further, the FDA has virtually no data on walleye and none on ""gourmet tuna"". These conclusions suggest that there are enough variations between the local data (Chicago) and the FDA data to warrant periodic local monitoring of commercial fish to provide up-to-date information to consumers about mercury in the fish they eat.",The Science of the total environment,"['D000704', 'D000818', 'D003132', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D007087', 'D008628', 'D018570', 'D017747', 'D013045', 'D013054', 'D018709']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Commerce', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Illinois', 'Mercury', 'Risk Assessment', 'Seafood', 'Species Specificity', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",Mercury in fish available in supermarkets in Illinois: are there regional differences.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16815532,2006

Fruit and vegetable samples (20 g) were extracted with 40 mL acetonitrile, salted out, and centrifuged. Half of the supernatant was passed into an Envi-18 cartridge, eluted with acetonitrile, and cleaned up with Envi-Carb and aminopropyl Sep-Pak cartridges in series after concentration of the eluates. Pesticides were eluted with acetonitrile-toluene (3 + 1, v/v), and eluates were concentrated to 0.5 mL and then added into internal standards after solvent exchange with 2 mL hexane and used for determination of 383 pesticides by GC/MS. The other half of the supernatant was concentrated to 1 mL and cleaned up with Envi-Carb and aminopropyl Sep-Pak cartridges in series. Pesticides were eluted with acetonitrile-toluene (3 + 1, v/v), and the eluates were concentrated to 0.5 mL, dried with nitrogen gas, diluted to 1.0 mL with acetonitrile-water (3 + 2, v/v), and used for determination of 63 pesticides by LC/MS/MS. The limit of detection for the method was 0.2-600 ng/g depending on the individual pesticide. In the method, fortification recovery tests at high, medium, and low levels were conducted on 6 varieties of fruits and vegetables, i.e., apples, oranges, grapes, cabbage, tomatoes, and celery, with average recoveries falling within the range of 55.0-133.8% for 446 pesticides, among which average recoveries between 60.0-120.0% accounted for 99% of the results.

Young fruits, at 50 days after full bloom (DAFB), were covered with bags made of single-, double-, and triple-layers of orange paper bag with 27.0%, 13.9% and 8.2% sunlight transmission, respectively. Ethylene production and respiration rate were measured, and fruit quality was analyzed at 111, 114, 117, 120 (firm-ripe stage) and 124 DAFB (full-ripe stage). Single- and triple-layer bagged fruits had higher ethylene production rates than double-layer bagged and un-bagged fruits. The skin of un-bagged fruit had higher brightness (L-value) but smaller hue angle (h degrees) at the full-ripe stage compared with that of bagged fruit. Flesh firmness of un-bagged fruit was higher than that of bagged fruit until the firm-ripe stage, although triple-layer bagged fruit had higher firmness than un-bagged fruit at the full-ripe stage. Total soluble solids in juice of single-layer bagged fruit were a little higher than those of other treated fruits at the full-ripe stage. Single-layer bagged fruit showed the highest level of gamma-decalactone, a main characteristic aroma of peach and total lactones at the firm-ripe and full-ripe stages.

Two visible pigments were apparent, a yellow pigment found in vegetative cells and an orange pigment found only in spores. We used high-performance liquid chromatography to characterize and quantify these pigments and found them to be carotenoids. The biosynthetic pathway that generates them branches with one that could lead to the spore-associated orange pigmentation.

16430154,"Certain surfactant-stabilized aqueous foams provide a potentially efficient and simple chemical route for the synthesis of various nanomaterials with controllable structure, size, and shape. In the present work, a one-step process for the synthesis of CdS and Cd1-xMn(x)S (0 < x < 10) nanocrystals has been described. Aqueous CdCl2 and the aerosol-OT solutions are homogeneously mixed together and thereafter, nitrogen is bubbled through this solution to produce stable aqueous foam. After drainage of the foam, the freestanding dry foam consisting of cadmium cations electrostatically complexed with the anionic aerosol-OT molecules at the liquid-gas interface is treated with H2S vapor. The foam turns yellowish-orange and collapses, in the process yielding CdS nanoclusters of variable morphology. This morphology variation is appropriately attributed to growth of the CdS as well as alloyed Cd1-xMn(x)S nanoparticles in different regions of the foam contributing to the varying topological structure. Optical absorption spectra of both CdS and Cd1-xMn(x)S nanoparticles clearly show a well-defined exciton absorption feature around 450 nm due to quantum confinement effects. The interesting band edge emission characteristics of these AOT-capped CdS and Cd1-xMn(x)S nanoparticles produced in the foam are discussed with respect to their size and shape.

GC-MS analysis performed after equilibration for 30 min at 40 degrees C showed the presence of 4.2 ng/g furan in green coffee. In order to understand whether furan was naturally present or formed during headspace sampling, green coffee was investigated in time-dependent manner at headspace equilibration temperatures of 40 and 70 degrees C. It was observed that furan response continued to increase in a way similar to first order formation kinetics. The same behavior was found for freshly squeezed tomato and orange juices leading to the suspicion of furan formation during headspace equilibration.

Photodiode array HPLC analysis was used to simultaneously determine the content and composition of fruit-flesh carotenoids and tocopherols in five pairs of near-isogenic lines differing in the allelic state of genes previously identified as having profound effects on fruit color. The dominant B allele promoted carotenoid accumulation up to 5-fold and prevented tocopherol accumulation in all genetic backgrounds. The dominant L-2 allele doubled carotenoid content and, in combination with the dominant B allele, increased carotenoid content by 10-15-fold as compared to the recessive l-2 allele. The genes D and L-1 had no significant effects on mesocarp tocopherols or carotenoids content.

16331907,"Through the use of simultaneous thermogravimetry modulated beam mass spectrometry, optical microscopy, hot-stage time-lapsed microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy measurements, the physical and chemical processes that control the thermal decomposition of 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (RDX) below its melting point (160-189 degrees C) have been identified. Two gas-phase reactions of RDX are predominant during the early stages of an experiment. One involves the loss of HONO and HNO and leads to the formation of H2O, NO, NO2, and oxy-s-triazine (OST) or s-triazine. The other involves the reaction of NO with RDX to form NO2 and 1-nitroso-3,5-dinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (ONDNTA), which subsequently decomposes to form a set of products of which CH2O and N2O are the most abundant. Products from the gas-phase RDX decomposition reactions, such as ONDNTA, deposit on the surface of the RDX particles and lead to the development of a new set of reaction pathways that occur on the surface of the RDX particles. The initial surface reactions occur on surfaces of those RDX particles in the sample that can accumulate the greatest amount of products from the gas-phase reactions. Initial surface reactions are characterized by the formation of islands of reactivity on the RDX surface and lead to the development of an orange-colored nonvolatile residue (NVR) film on the surface of the RDX particles. The NVR film is most likely formed via the decomposition of ONDNTA on the surface of the RDX particles. The NVR film is a nonstoichiometric and dynamic material, which reacts directly with RDX and ONDNTA, and is composed of remnants from RDX and ONDNTA molecules that have reacted with the NVR. Reactions involving the NVR become dominant during the later stage of the decomposition process. The NVR reacts with RDX to form ONDNTA via abstraction of an oxygen atom from an NO2 group. ONDNTA may undergo rapid loss of N2 and NO2 with the remaining portion of the molecule being incorporated into the dynamic NVR. The dynamic NVR also decomposes and leads to the formation of H2O, CH2O, N2O, NH2CHO, (CH3)2NCHO, (CH3)2NNO, C2H2N2O, and (CH3)3N or CH3NCH2CH3. The competition between reaction of the dynamic NVR with RDX and its own thermal decomposition manifests itself in a rapid increase in the rate of evolution of the NVR decomposition products as the amount of RDX remaining in the sample nears depletion. The reactions between the NVR film and RDX on the surface of the RDX particles leads to a localized environment that creates a layer of molten RDX on the surface of the particles where reactions associated with the liquid-phase decomposition of RDX may occur. The combination of these reaction processes leads to an acceleration of the reaction rate in the later stage of the decomposition process and creates an apparent reaction rate behavior that has been referred to as autocatalytic in many previous studies of RDX decomposition. A reaction scheme summarizing the reaction pathways that contribute to the decomposition of RDX below its melting point is presented.",The journal of physical chemistry.

A Capcell Pak SG-Phenyl column (4.6 mm [inner diameter] x 25 cm; particle size 5 mm; Shiseido) was used, and the flow rate was set at a constant 1 ml/min. A photodiode array detector was used because it reveals the characteristic UV-absorption spectrum of FCs, commonly with 311 nm as the maximum wavelength. Furanocoumarin derivatives in pomelo juice (PJ) were detected by the method and compared with those in grapefruit juice (GJ) and orange juice (OJ). GJ contained 3 kinds of FCs, BG, DHB and bergaptol (BT). OJ had no FCs. On the other hand, PJ contained 8 kinds of FCs including BT, BG and DHB.

Two orange-based products are present on the market: pasteurized pure juice with 40 days of shelf life, and sterilized beverage containing minimum 12% of concentrated fruit juice. The aim of the present paper is to verify the relationships between the antioxidant properties and the anthocyanins content in a sampling of pasteurized and sterilized commercial red orange juices. The anthocyanins composition was determined by HPLC-MS/MS, while the antioxidant activity was evaluated by the Briggs-Rauscher reaction, selected in order to acquire information at acid pH values, by three radical scavenging assays (DMPD, 2-2'-azinobis-(3-ethylenbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), DPPH), and by FRAP assay to monitor the ferric reducing power. Results showed that antioxidant activity, particularly when measured by ABTS method, is positively related to the content of anthocyanins and that the reduction of anthocyanins content, typical of commercial long-shelf life juices, leads to a remarkable loss of antioxidant power.",Molecular nutrition & food research,"['D000872', 'D000975', 'D052160', 'D001628', 'D001713', 'D002851', 'D032084', 'D005290', 'D005511', 'D005638', 'D006863', 'D013058', 'D010084', 'D010851', 'D010881', 'D013451']","['Anthocyanins', 'Antioxidants', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Beverages', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Ferric Compounds', 'Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Picrates', 'Piperidones', 'Sulfonic Acids']",Antioxidant activity of pasteurized and sterilized commercial red orange juices.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16254888,2006
16248571,"Cantaloupe cultivar variability from various U.S. regions and growing seasons within a given year was evaluated. As expected, there was often considerable quality and volatile variation among cultivars. Eight of 11 cultivars met the standard U.S. No. 1 requirement for degrees Brix (> or =9), and in most cultivars, degrees Brix declined during fresh-cut storage at 4 degrees C. Hunter L (loss of lightness color value) and a (decline of typical orange hue) colors also generally declined during storage in most cultivars. Volatile ester compounds generally decreased during fresh-cut storage or exhibited a transient increase before declining after 5-7 days of storage. The relative percentage of acetate esters declined during storage in all cultivars, and declines were accompanied by simultaneous non-acetate ester increases. Slight imbalances in compound concentrations may alter the overall perception of desirable, typical ""cantaloupe"" aroma/flavor during fresh-cut storage. Upsetting the unique aroma balance through storage may negatively affect flavor and the consumer's perception of desirable attributes, even though total volatile levels might not decrease substantially until after 5-7 days in storage. Subtle volatile and quality decreases are likely to be exacerbated with immature-harvested cantaloupe and are likely in out-of-season exports that have likewise been harvested at less mature stages.

Two programs, PKPLS and PWPTPLS, were designed to perform the calculations. Data reduction was performed using kernel matrices and wavelet packet transform, respectively. In the KPLS method, the size of the kernel matrix is only dependent on the number of samples, thus the method was suitable for the data matrix with many wavelengths and fewer samples. Wavelet packet representations of signals provide a local time-frequency description, thus in the wavelet packet domain, the quality of the noise removal can be improved. In the WPTPLS by optimization, wavelet function and decomposition level were selected as Daubeches 12 and 5, respectively.

Differently pigmented mutants were obtained from M. purpureus IB1 by nitrosoguanidine treatment. A highly pigmented strain, M. purpureus HP14, was found to lack the formation of the classical yellow and orange azaphilones and was found to produce only about 10% of the red azaphilone pigments. The intense color was associated with novel pigments as shown by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The addition of hexanoic acid to M. purpureus IB1 resulted in higher volumetric and specific red pigment productivity, but in a complete absence of the classical orange azaphilones, while the classical yellow and red azaphilone pigments were severely reduced; new peaks corresponding to less hydrophobic pigments were found in hexanoic-supplemented cultures by HPLC. Purification of pigments from hexanoic-supplemented cultures showed the presence of five new pigments as indicated by the absorption spectra and HPLC analysis.

They constitute one of the most characteristic classes found in nature and more than 4000 flavonoids have been identified and divided into several subclasses. Flavonoids have several effects on human health, mainly related to their antioxidant activity. As a result of the increased interest in the biologically active compounds in food, many research studies have investigated the detection and quantification of antioxidants. Citrus plants are of great interest since they accumulate large amounts of flavonoids and fruit and juices of these species are consumed in large quantities. Despite the extensive research performed on Citrus flavonoids, many compounds still remain unidentified. In this work, flavonoids of five citrus juices: lemon, grapefruit, bergamot, orange, and mandarin were analyzed by microHPLC coupled on-line with an MS detector equipped with an ESI source operating in negative mode.

Several potential organic contaminants from agricultural (e.g., DDT and its breakdown products, lindane, endrin, dieldrin, endosulfan) and industrial (PCBs) sources were measured. Sediment burdens for all compounds, even for an apparent hot spot near a refinery in Bahrain, were amongst the lowest reported for surface sediments from other seas. Concentrations of DDTs were low in the muscle and liver of all fish (orange spotted grouper and the spangled emperor) analysed. Similarly, the levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons were low in the various bivalve species, notably rock oysters and pearl oysters. These results contribute to the sparse regional database for organochlorinated compounds in the marine environment. Moreover, they can be used as the most recent end point for elucidating temporal trends.

Linearity of response over two orders of magnitude was demonstrated (r > 0.99). Matrix effects resulting in suppression or enhancement of the response were frequently observed, most notably in broccoli and citrus. Instrumental limits of detection (LOD) were between 0.0005 and 0.03 mg/kg depending on the commodity and pesticide studied, all being within European Union regulations for food monitoring program. Finally, the methodology was applied to the analysis of two samples from an inter-laboratory exercise.

15912236,"An analytical method is reported to determine trace amounts of furan in several different commercial foodstuffs that are subjected to thermal treatment. The SPME-GC-MS method is rapid and robust, and entails the following steps: addition of deuterated furan to the sample, sodium chloride-assisted extraction into the headspace, cryofocussing, and finally fibre desorption and GC-MS analysis. Furan is quantified by the use of an external calibration curve, achieving a decision limit (CC alpha) and detection capability (CC beta) of 17 pg and 43 pg, respectively, as absolute furan concentration in a 10 ml headspace vial. The method is applicable to a wide variety of foods, including fruits juices, baby foods in jars, canned foods, pet food, coffee and coffee substitutes. Typical amounts of furan found in selected foodstuffs range from about 1 microg kg(-1) (fruit juice) to 110 microg kg(-1) (baby food containing cooked vegetables). In-house validation data show good precision and accuracy of the method, with a typical repeatability of between 5 and 16% in different food matrices, and trueness determined in orange juice and coffee as 87 and 93%, respectively.

During storage at 4 degrees C, degradation curves of ascorbic acid followed a linear decrease pattern in both ohmic-heated and conventionally pasteurized orange juices. For five representative flavor compounds (decanal, octana, limonene, pinene, and myrcene), higher concentrations were measured during storage in the ohmic-heated orange juice than in conventionally pasteurized juice. Although residual pectin esterase activity remained negligible in both types of juices, particle size was lower in the ohmic-heated orange juice. The sensory shelf life was determined by using the Weibull-Hazard method.

The laccase treatment showed high decolorization rates but cannot degrade all investigated dyes (reactive dyes), and high anionic strength led to enzyme deactivation. Ultrasound treatment can decolorize all tested dyes after 3 h at a high energy input, and prolonged sonication leads to nontoxic ionic species, which was demonstrated by ion chromatography and toxicity assays. For the first time, it was shown that a combination of laccase and ultrasound treatments can have synergistic effects, which was shown by higher degradation rates. Bulk light absorption and ion-pairing high-performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC) were used for process monitoring, while with reversed-phase HPLC, a lower number of intermediates than expected by IP-HPLC was found.

Our results showed that the concentration of polyphenolics varied among the apple cultivars, with Pacific Queen containing 2.7 times the amount of polyphenolics found in Cox's Orange. Furthermore, there were significant differences in polyphenolic concentrations in fruit from different regions for some cultivars but not for others.

The Rf values of 118 pesticides were tested in eleven elution systems with UV, and eight biotest methods and chemical detection reagents. Cabbage, green peas, orange, and tomatoes were selected as representative sample matrices for fruits and vegetables, while maize, rice, and wheat represented cereal grains. As an internal quality control measure, marker compounds were applied on each plate to verify the proper elution and detection conditions. The Rf values varied in the different elution systems. The best separation (widest Rf range) was achieved with silica gel (SG)--ethyl acetate (0.05-0.7), SG--benzene, (0.02-0.7) and reverse phase RP-18 F-254S layer with acetone: methanol: water/30:30:30 (v/v) (0.1-0.8).

15759299,"In this work, the development of a new chiral capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) method to separate D- and L-amino acids is shown. On-line coupling between CE and MS is established through an electrospray-coaxial sheath flow interface. Enantiomer separation is achieved by using a cheap, nonvolatile, chiral selector as beta-cyclodextrin in the background electrolyte (BGE) together with a physically coated capillary that is aimed to prevent contamination of the electrospray. The capillary coating is simple and easy to obtain as it only requires flushing of the capillary with a polymer aqueous solution for 3 min. Optimization of CE parameters (pH of BGE, type and concentration of chiral selector, and capillary inner diameter) and electrospray-MS parameters (nature and flow rate of the sheath liquid, nebulizer pressure) is carried out. Two different derivatization protocols of amino acids using dansyl chloride (DNS) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) are compared in terms of MS sensitivity and chiral resolution. Under optimum CE-MS conditions it is observed that the MS sensitivity obtained for FITC- and DNS-amino acids is similar (with limit of detection (LOD) in the microM range, corresponding to amounts injected in the fmol range) while chiral resolution is better for FITC-amino acids. The optimized method is demonstrated to provide the simultaneous analysis of 15 selected amino acids (i.e., FITC-D/L-Asp, -Glu, -Ser, -Asn, -Ala, -Pro, -Arg, and FITC-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in a single chiral CE-MS run, corresponding to the main amino acids that can be found in orange. Moreover, as a result of the high resolution achieved, it is possible to detect down to 2% of D-Asp in the presence of 98% of L-Asp. The good possibilities of chiral CE-MS in food analysis are corroborated through the detection of the main amino acids in a commercial orange juice (i.e., FITC-L-Asp, -Glu, -Ser, -Asn, -Pro, -Arg, and the nonchiral FITC-GABA) as well as the determination of the fraudulent addition of synthetic amino acids (containing D- and L-forms) to a fresh orange juice.",Electrophoresis,"['D000596', 'D019075', 'D005504', 'D013058', 'D013056', 'D013237']","['Amino Acids', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Food Analysis', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Stereoisomerism']",Chiral capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry of amino acids in foods.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, None]","['analysis', 'methods', 'methods', 'methods', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15759299,2005
15737545,"The recognition of electrostatically-bound DNA-didodecyldimethylammonium (DNA-DDDA) complex by three dye molecules, acridine orange (AO), ethidium bromide (EB) and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-N-methylpyridyl) porphyrin tetra(p-toluenesulfonate) (TMPyP) in organic media was investigated through 1H NMR, UV-vis, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. When the organic solvent in which DNA-DDDA complex dissolves is changed from ethanol to chloroform, the adsorbed AO undergoes a reversible transformation from a monomer to a highly aggregated state at the interface between DNA and DDDA. EB also adsorbs at the interface between DNA and DDDA when EB interacts with the DNA-DDDA complex in organic media, but its existing state is independent of the used solvents. The third dye, TMPyP cation can intercalate into the G-C region while its anionic p-tosylate counterion remains unbound when it mixes with DNA complex in organic media. The complexes of DDDA with previously recognized DNA by the three dye molecules (DNA-dye), respectively, are also investigated. AO seems having changed its location from the grooves of DNA to the interface between DNA and DDDA after DNA-AO complex was electrostatically encapsulated with DDDA. The aggregation behavior of AO also shows a dependence on the polarity of the organic solvent. EB molecules are believed to intercalate into the base pairs of DNA in aqueous solution. The intercalation mode is still maintained after the encapsulation for DNA-EB in organic solvents, which is different from the situation between DNA-DDDA complex and EB. But in both cases, the existing states of EB are independent of the polarity of the organic solvents. Finally, TMPyP in the complex of DNA-TMPyP and DDDA is also judged to intercalate into the G-C region of DNA while its anionic p-tosylate counterion remains separated from DNA complex, which is similar to its interaction with DNA-DDDA complex in organic media. These data also strongly suggest that the intercalation state of TMPyP is more stable than its adsorption state in grooves when it is recognized with DNA. The present results are significant for the designs of both laser dye and conductive materials.","Colloids and surfaces.

15700046,"Following the withdrawal of ephedrine from the dietary supplement marketplace sales of products containing Citrus aurantium (CA) (bitter orange) for weight loss are believed to have increased dramatically. CA contains a number of constituents speculated to lead to weight loss, of which the most frequently cited constituent is synephrine. Concerns have been raised about the safety of products containing synephrine. To develop an adequate basis for clinical and public health recommendations, it is necessary to understand the nature of the synephrine alkaloids in CA. There are six possible isomers of synephrine (para, meta, ortho; and for each a d or l form). Some authors have stated that CA contains only p-synephrine, whereas other authors have stated that CA contains m-synephrine. This is an important distinction because the two molecules have different pharmacologic properties, which may differentially affect safety and efficacy. We are unable to identify published data that explicitly show whether CA contains p-synephrine, m-synephrine, or both. In this brief report, we show that at least one product purportedly containing synephrine alkaloids from CA contains both p-synephrine and m-synephrine.

TEAC and ORAC values were very highly correlated with each other and also with values for total phenolics, betalain contents, and ascorbic acid concentrations. Total phenolics had the greatest contribution to ORAC and TEAC values. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detector (DAD)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) measurements of cactus pear juices permitted the differentiation of the clones based on variations in pigment patterns and betalain concentrations. The red and yellow betalains were absent in lime green colored cactus fruits. The ratio and concentration of these pigments were responsible for the yellow, orange, red, and purple colors in the other clones. Progeny of purple and lime green colored parents were characterized by 12% and 88% of plants bearing lime green and purple fruit, respectively. This implies that the genes for betalain production were lacking in the lime green fruits but could be provided by a parent with a complete set of genes, that is, purple fruits. Besides known pigments typical of Cactaceae, two unexpected betalains were identified.

Nine transformation products were identified using these complementary analyses performed ex situ without any prior treatment. Three types of cleavage are proposed for the degradation pathway: (i) a symmetrical splitting of the azo linkage that leads to the formation of 4-aminobenzenesulfonate (and 1-amino-2-naphthol, not detected); (ii) an asymmetrical cleavage on the naphthalene side that generates 1,2-naphthoquinone and 4-diazoniumbenzenesulfonate as products, with the latter one being transformed into 4-hydroxybenzensulfonate; and (iii) a third degradation pathway that leads to 2-naphthol and 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate.

15352023,"The use of chiral amino acids content and stepwise discriminant analysis to classify three types of commercial orange juices (i.e., nectars, orange juices reconstituted from concentrates, and pasteurized orange juices not from concentrates) is presented. Micellar electrokinetic chromatography with laser-induced fluorescence (MEKC-LIF) and beta-cyclodextrins are used to determine L- and D-amino acids previously derivatized with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). This chiral MEKC-LIF procedure is easy to implement and provides information about the main amino acids content in orange juices (i.e., L-proline; L-aspartic acid, D-Asp, L-serine, L-asparagine, L-glutamic acid, D-Glu, L-alanine, L-.arginine, D-Arg, and the non-chiral gamma-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA), i.e., gamma-aminobutyric acid). From these results, it is clearly demonstrated that some D-amino acids occur naturally in orange juices. Application of stepwise discriminant analysis to 26 standard samples showed that the amino acids L-Arg, L-Asp and GABA were the most important variables to differentiate the three groups of samples. With these three selected amino acids a 100% correct classification of the samples was obtained either by standard or by leave-one-out cross-validation procedures. These classification functions based on the content in L-Arg, L-Asp and GABA were also applied to nine test samples and provided an adequate classification and/or interesting information on these samples. It is concluded that chiral MEKC-LIF analysis of amino acids and stepwise discriminant analysis can be used as a consistent procedure to classify commercial orange juices providing useful information about their quality and processing.

15237407,"A highly sensitive procedure to detect multiple pesticides at trace levels in foods is presented. Initially a comparative study between capillary electrophoresis (CE)-UV and CE-mass spectrometry (MS) is carried out analyzing five pesticides not studied up to now (pyrimethanil, pyrifenox, cyprodinil, cyromazine, and pirimicarb). The comparison between CE-UV and CE-MS is established in terms of separation efficiency, speed of analysis, reproducibility, and sensitivity. A good separation of these compounds is achieved by both techniques using a volatile aqueous buffer containing 0.3 M ammonium acetate/acetic acid at pH 4. Time analysis reproducibility is studied for the same day (n = 5) and three different days (n = 15), showing no significant differences between CE-UV and CE-MS. The study on peak areas reproducibility shows a slightly worse reproducibility for CE-MS compared with CE-UV. The best limit of detection (LOD) that can be achieved for these pesticides using CE-UV was 0.6 microg/mL. CE-MS provides LODs one order of magnitude better than CE-UV. Chemometrics are used to optimize the multiple parameters that play a role in solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and CE-MS analysis (e.g., extraction and desorption times, nebulizer pressure, dry gas flow, dry gas temperature, percentage of organic solvent and acid in the sheath liquid, etc.). The combined use of chemometrics and SPME-CE-MS clearly improves the LODs that can be achieved allowing the detection of pesticides at concentrations down to 15 ng/mL. The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated detecting multiple pesticides in different food samples as grapes and orange juice in a single run. The concentrations detected are below the maximum residue limits (MRLs) permitted for these pesticides in foods corroborating the value of our approach.

15156042,"The flavonoids, constituting one of the most numerous and widespread groups of natural plant constituents, are important to humans not only because they contribute to plant colors but also because many members are physiologically active. These low-molecular-weight substances, found in all vascular plants, are phenylbenzopyrones. Over 4000 structures have been identified in plant sources, and they are categorized into several groups. Primarily recognized as pigments responsible for the autumnal burst of hues and the many shades of yellow, orange, and red in flowers and food, the flavonoids are found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, stems, flowers, and leaves as well as tea and wine and are important constituents of the human diet. They are prominent components of citrus fruits and other food sources. Flavonols (quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol) and flavones (apigenin and luteolin) are the most common phenolics in plant-based foods. Quercetin is also a predominant component of onions, apples, and berries. Such flavanones as naringin are typically present in citrus fruit, and flavanols, particularly catechin, are present as catechin gallate in such beverages as green or black tea and wine. Some major sources of flavonoids are outlined in Table 1. The daily intake of flavonoids in humans has been estimated to be approx 25 mg/d, a quantity that could provide pharmacologically significant concentrations in body fluids and tissues, assuming good absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Biological activity of flavonoids was first suggested by Szent-Gÿorgyi 1938, who reported that citrus peel flavonoids were effective in preventing the capillary bleeding and fragility associated with scurvy. The broad spectrum of biological activity within the group and the multiplicity of actions displayed by a certain individual members make the flavonoids one of the most promising classes of biologically active compounds.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","['D000890', 'D001118', 'D019659', 'D002854', 'D004926', 'D005419', 'D007202', 'D008826', 'D008958', 'D015394', 'D008517', 'D012997']","['Anti-Infective Agents', 'Argentina', 'Asteraceae', 'Chromatography, Paper', 'Escherichia coli', 'Flavonoids', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phytotherapy', 'Solvents']",Flavonoids from Argentine Tagetes (Asteraceae) with antimicrobial activity.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000187', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'drug effects', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15156042,2004

Smaller areas of Laos and Cambodia were also sprayed with Agent Orange between 1962 and 1971 from fixed-wing aircraft. In 2001, 28 food samples consisting of meat, fish, and dairy products were collected in sprayed and nonsprayed areas of Laos and analyzed for dioxins, dioxinlike dibenzofurans, and selected polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry at laboratories in Germany and Canada. Low levels of dioxin and other dioxinlike substances were found in Laotian food, similar to levels present in recent exported Vietnamese food to United States. Vietnam is geographically adjacent to Laos. Total dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) levels were similar in samples from sprayed and non-sprayed areas, ranging from 0.009 to 0.851 pg/g or parts per trillion (ppt) in sprayed Sepone, and from 0.022 to 0.537 pg/g or ppt wet weight in non sprayed Vientiane. However, the Laotian fish samples from the Agent Orange-sprayed area had, on average, a higher proportion of total TEQ from TCDD (31.7% vs. 9.4%) compared to the nonsprayed area.

Ninety pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years were equally recruited from three villages. Seven-day food frequency data was collected by questionnaire. Plasma levels of retinol, carotenoids, and tocopherols were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results indicated that cooked green leafy vegetables constituted the major source of provitamin A carotenoids, with low intake of yellow/orange fruits and preformed vitamin A.

Several authors have reported enhanced stability of esterified xanthophylls, so plants containing zeaxanthin esters were investigated to establish valuable sources for the production of durable oleoresins. Liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry [LC-(APCI)MS] was used to unequivocally identify zeaxanthin esters of a standard mixture and in several plant extracts.

Mean mercury concentrations in caps and stalks of the mushroom species examined and soils varied between 30+/-31 and 920+/-280, 17+/-11 and 560+/-220, and 10+/-9 and 170+/-110 ng/g dry matter, respectively. Cap to stalk mercury concentration quotients were from 1.0+/-0.4 in poison pax (Paxillus involutus) to 2.8+/-0.7 in slippery jack (Suillus luteus). Brown cort (Cortinarius malicorius), fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), orange-brown ringless amanita (A. fulva), red-aspen bolete (Leccinum rufum) and mutagen milk cap (Lactarius necator) contained the highest concentrations of mercury both in caps and stalks, and mean concentrations varied between 600+/-750 and 920+/-280 and 370+/-470 and 560+/-220 ng/g dry matter, respectively. An estimate of daily intake of mercury from mushroom consumption indicated that the flesh of edible species of mushrooms may not pose hazards to human health even at a maximum consumption rate of 28 g/day. However, it should be noted that mercury intake from other foods will augment the daily intake rates. Species such as the sickener (Russula emetica), Geranium-scented russula (R. fellea) and poison pax (P. involutus) did not concentrate mercury as evidenced from the bioconcentration factors (BCFs: concentrations in mushroom/concentration in soil substrate), which were less than 1. Similarly, red-hot milk cap (L. rufus), rickstone funnel cap (Clitocybe geotropa) and European cow bolete (S. bovinus) were observed to be weak accumulators of mercury. Fly agaric (A. muscaria) accumulated great concentrations of mercury with BCFs reaching 73+/-42 and 38+/-22 in caps and stalks, respectively. Mercury BCFs of between 4.0+/-2.3 and 23+/-25 (caps) and 2.6+/-1.9 and 14+/-12 (stalks) were noted for the other mushroom species.

Agent Orange was used mainly in Vietnam, but also to a lesser extent in Laos and Cambodia. In Laos, there have been no prior studies of TCDD contamination from Agent Orange, despite known defoliation and documented records of Agent Orange spraying. This article presents findings of TCDD in human blood and milk from two geographic areas in Laos: Vientiane, a nonsprayed area, and Sepone, an Agent Orange-sprayed area. German and Canadian laboratories used high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to measure 7 dioxin, 10 dibenzofuran, and 4 non-ortho or coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls in Laotian blood and milk samples. Most subjects tested in this Laos Ministry of Health Study showed low dioxin and dibenzofuran levels, consistent with what would be expected in a primarily rural nonindustrial country. These findings are consistent with relatively low dioxin and dibenzofuran levels recently found in food from these same areas. The chemically and toxicologically related non-ortho PCBs were measured but were found at low levels compared to specimens from other countries, presumably because of less industrialization and industrial pollution in Laos.",Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

14518049,"To meet the need for a new and validated analytical method for simultaneous determination of inorganic and organic acid anions in beverage drinks, a capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) procedure had been developed based on a new background electrolyte (BGE) system containing 3 mmol/L 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTA), 15 mmol/L tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and 1.5 mmol/L tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) at pH 8.4. Baseline separation of anions commonly found in beverage drinks could be achieved in less than 14 min with indirect UV detection at 240 nm. Comigration problems for hydroxycarboxylic acids could be solved using TEPA as BGE additive. The results indicate excellent repeatability for migration time (RSD, 0.27-0.67%, n = 5) and good precision for both peak height (RSD, 3.2-4.2%, n = 5) and peak area (RSD, 3.1-4.5%, n = 5). Under the optimized conditions and using corrected peak area for quantitation, an excellent linear dynamic range (with correlation coefficient > 0.997 in a concentration range from 0.005 to 2.0 mmol/L) and low detection limit (1-4 micro mol/L) were obtained for all the anions investigated. The applicability and reliability of the CE procedure developed were established by parallel method determination using established ion chromatography procedure for the analysis of inorganic and organic acid anions in orange juice and wine samples.

In the past, some Vietnamese fish was found to be contaminated with dioxin, 2,3,7,8-TCDD, or TCDD, from Agent Orange. U.S. commercial catfish farmers recently claimed that exported Vietnamese food, especially catfish, was contaminated with dioxin from Agent Orange and was thus a matter of concern to the U.S. Congress. In 2001, twenty-two exported Vietnamese food samples (mostly fish) were purchased in the United States and Laos to evaluate possible contamination with dioxin from Agent Orange. Dioxin, dibenzofuran, and coplanar PCB congeners were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry by laboratories in Germany and Canada certified for dioxin analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the current study, only low levels of dioxins and dioxinlike compounds were present in all exported Vietnamese food analyzed, despite recent findings of elevated levels of one dioxin, 2,3,7,8-TCDD, from Agent Orange exposure in some Vietnamese individuals, presumably due to food consumption.

12810636,"Past work using the human-hamster hybrid line GM10115 has demonstrated that exposure to a variety of DNA damaging agents can lead to the persistent destabilization of chromosomes. To gain insight into the potential biochemical mechanisms involved in perpetuating the unstable phenotype, groups of clones characterized as stable or unstable were analyzed for indications of oxidative stress. All of the clones were derived from single progenitor cells surviving exposure to ionizing radiation or chemicals. Compared with their stable counterparts, unstable clones possessed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as measured by their enhanced ability to oxidize fluorogenic dyes. Fluorescence automated cell sorting analysis indicated that unstable clones had significantly higher mean fluorescence signals of approximately 2-fold and approximately 1.25-fold, respectively, as derived from the dyes 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and dihydrorhodamine 123, respectively. To determine whether mitochondria might constitute a potential source of ROS, stable and unstable clones of cells were analyzed for mitochondrial content using nonyl acridine orange and function using rhodamine 123. Fluorescence automated cell sorting data indicated that compared with stable clones, unstable clones possessed an elevated number (15% increase in mean nonyl acridine orange fluorescence) of dysfunctional mitochondria (27% decrease in mean rhodamine 123 fluorescence). Interestingly, the consequences of elevated ROS did not translate to an increase in oxidative base damage in nuclear DNA. Analysis of nine different base damage adducts by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry did not reveal significant differences between stable and unstable clones. The data suggest that the perpetuation of many of the abnormal phenotypes associated with genomic instability may be linked to a state of chronic oxidative stress derived in part from dysfunctional mitochondria.",Cancer research,"['D000782', 'D000818', 'D001761', 'D002412', 'D002875', 'D002999', 'D006224', 'D004249', 'D004307', 'D005456', 'D006801', 'D006822', 'D008928', 'D010084', 'D018384', 'D017382']","['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Bleomycin', 'Cations', 'Chromosomes', 'Clone Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Mitochondria', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",Persistent oxidative stress in chromosomally unstable cells.,"[None, None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000166', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000166', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'pharmacology', None, 'drug effects', 'cytology', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'cytology', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12810636,2003

After the sorption process the highest concentration of toluene was observed in the flavedo, where the oil glands of kumquats and mandarins are located. The data obtained prove that the high dissolution of aromatic hydrocarbons results from the presence of essential oils in the oil glands.

UV absorption and fluorescence studies were also carried to observe the behaviour of these xanthines on the modulation of the binding mode of anticancer agents (cisplatin, novantrone, and actinomycin D) and certain intercalating dyes (EtBr and AO) to DNA. In TCSPC analysis we found that when the concentration of the drugs (X1, X2 and X3) increased from 0.025 mM to 2 mM i.e. P/D 2.4 to P/D 0.03 reduction in intercalation of EtBr and AO was observed, suggesting that xanthine derivatives could play very important role in reducing the DNA-directed toxicity in a dose dependent manner. In TCSPC, the amplitude of smaller lifetime component A(1) and higher lifetime component A(2) are attributed to free and intercalated dye concentration and their variation could indicate the process of intercalation or reduced intercalation of EtBr and AO by xanthine derivatives. We found that at the maximum drug concentration the smaller lifetime component A(1) was increased by 7-8% and 17-37% in EtBr and AO intercalated complex respectively. Also the changes in lifetime and fluorescence decay profile were observed for the DNA-intercalated dyes before and after treatment with xanthines. Especially, at maximum P/D 0.03 the lifetime of DNA-intercalated EtBr and AO reduced by 1-2 ns. The present analysis reveals that xanthines are able to interact with free dyes and also with intercalated dyes, suggesting that when they interact with free dyes they might inhibit the further intercalation of dye molecules to DNA and the interaction with intercalated dyes might lead to displacement of the dyes resulting in de-intercalation.

Green vegetables had the highest concentration of lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z), and the ratios of these carotenoids (L/Z) were in the range 12-63. The yellow-orange fruits and vegetables, with the exception of squash (butternut variety), had much lower levels of lutein in comparison to greens but contained a higher concentration of zeaxanthin.

The present work deals with the quantification of Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) in different varieties of citrus essential oils, using derivative potentiometric stripping analysis. Two different metals extraction procedures, involving concentrated hydrochloric acid treatment and acid-alcoholic dissolution, are tested on lemon, mandarin, sweet orange, and bergamot essential oils, and they give very similar results. Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) recovery tests spanned from 95 to 100.50%, providing evidence that metals quantification remained unaffected by the cleanup steps of the two procedures. The repeatability of the hydrochloric acid extraction method, applied on different varieties of essential oils, is >95.00% for Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II), whereas the repeatability of the acid-alcoholic dissolution method is >93.00% for Cu and Cd only in lemon oil.

12537436,"Vitamin C, provitamin A carotenoids, and other carotenoids were measured in freshly squeezed juices from oranges (Citrus sinensis L. var. Valencia late) that were subjected to high-pressure (HP) treatment. Also, the stability of these compounds was studied during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C. HP treatment is an alternative to heat preservation methods for foods; therefore, it is essential to assess the impact of HP on bioactive compounds. Several processes that combine HP treatment with heat treatment for various time periods were assayed: T0, fresh juice (without treatment); T1, 100 MPa/60 degrees C/5 min; T2, 350 MPa/30 degrees C/2.5 min; T3, 400 MPa/40 degrees C/1 min. Fresh and treated samples were kept refrigerated (4 degrees C) over 10 days. After application of HP and during the refrigeration period, the qualitative and quantitative determination of vitamin C, provitamin A carotenoids (beta- and alpha-carotene; beta- and alpha-cryptoxanthin), and the xanthophylls zeaxanthin and lutein was achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography. T1 and T3 juices showed a decrease in ascorbic acid and total vitamin C just after HP treatment (D0) compared with T0 juices. On the contrary, T2 juices, just after HP treatment (D0), had the same levels of both compounds compared to untreated juices. T1, T2, and T3 treatments led to an increase in the extraction of carotenoids and provitamin A carotenoids. Total carotenoid content after the 10-day refrigerated storage period resulted in no significant quantitative changes in T1 juices, whereas in T2 and T3 juices small losses were found at the end of the storage period (20.56 and 9.16%, respectively). These losses could be influenced by the depleted protection of vitamin C toward carotenoid oxidation during the same period.

Owing to absorption, the amount of flavour compounds in the model solution exposed to LDPE decreased substantially. From the model flavour solution valencene was almost completely absorbed by LDPE, followed to a lesser extent by decanal, hexyl acetate, octanal and nonanone. Less flavour compounds were absorbed from the model solution by PC and PET. In contrast to LDPE, valencene was absorbed in the lowest amounts and decanal in the highest. Limonene was readily absorbed from orange juice by LDPE, while myrcene, valencene, pinene and decanal were absorbed in smaller quantities. Only three flavour compounds were absorbed from orange juice by PC and PET in very small amounts: limonene, myrcene and decanal. Although the flavour content between controls and polymer-treated samples differed substantially, the loss of flavour compounds due to absorption by LDPE, PC and PET did not influence taste perception of a model solution and orange juice significantly up to 29 days of dark storage at 20 degrees C as determined by triangular taste panel tests.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000042', 'D000080462', 'D000447', 'D001628', 'D002087', 'D002849', 'D002957', 'D053138', 'D005421', 'D018857', 'D006801', 'D000077222', 'D039821', 'D000442', 'D011076', 'D020959', 'D011093', 'D012996', 'D013649', 'D013729']","['Absorption', 'Acyclic Monoterpenes', 'Aldehydes', 'Beverages', 'Butyrates', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Citrus', 'Cyclohexenes', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Food Packaging', 'Humans', 'Limonene', 'Monoterpenes', 'Octanols', 'Polycarboxylate Cement', 'Polyethylene', 'Polyethylene Terephthalates', 'Solutions', 'Taste', 'Terpenes']","Influence of flavour absorption by food-packaging materials (low-density polyethylene, polycarbonate and polyethylene terephthalate) on taste perception of a model solution and orange juice.","[None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12519723,2003

The purpose of this study was to characterize the influence of intestinal CYP3A4 modulation with grapefruit juice and Seville orange juice on indinavir pharmacokinetics. In an open-label, three-period crossover study, 13 healthy volunteers received indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours for 1 day and a single 800 mg dose the next morning. The last two indinavir doses were taken with 8 ounces of Seville orange juice, single-strength grapefruit juice, or water (control). Plasma samples were collected at time 0 (predose) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours after the last indinavir dose. Concentration-time data were analyzed using noncompartmental methods. Coadministration of Seville orange juice and indinavir resulted in a statistically significant increase in indinavir t(max) (1.87 [1.65-2.22] vs. 1.25 [1.03-1.60] h; p < 0.05) without altering other pharmacokinetic parameter values.

12188615,"Phenolic compounds, vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid and L-dehydroascorbic acid), and antioxidant capacity were evaluated in orange juices manufactured by different techniques. Five processes at industrial scale (squeezing, mild pasteurization, standard pasteurization, concentration, and freezing) used in commercial orange juice manufacturing were studied. In addition, domestic squeezing (a hand processing technique) was compared with commercial squeezing (an industrial FMC single-strength extraction) to evaluate their influences on health components of orange juice. Whole orange juice was divided into soluble and cloud fractions after centrifugation. Total and individual phenolics were analyzed in both fractions by HPLC. Commercial squeezing extracted 22% more phenolics than hand squeezing. The freezing process caused a dramatic decrease in phenolics, whereas the concentration process caused a mild precipitation of these compounds to the juice cloud. In pulp, pasteurization led to degradation of several phenolic compounds, that is, caffeic acid derivatives, vicenin 2 (apigenin 6,8-di-C-glucoside), and narirutin (5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavanone-7-rutinoside) with losses of 34.5, 30.7, and 28%, respectively. Regarding vitamin C, orange juice produced by commercial squeezing contained 25% more of this compound than domestic squeezing. Mild and standard pasteurization slightly increased the total vitamin C content as the contribution from the orange solids parts, whereas concentration and freezing did not show significant changes. The content of L-ascorbic acid provided 77-96% of the total antioxidant capacity of orange juice. Mild pasteurization, standard pasteurization, concentration, and freezing did not affect the total antioxidant capacity of juice, but they did, however, in pulp, where it was reduced by 47%.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000975', 'D047310', 'D001205', 'D001628', 'D002109', 'D002498', 'D011232', 'D002851', 'D002957', 'D003373', 'D005419', 'D005511', 'D005525', 'D005615', 'D005960', 'D047311', 'D010636']","['Antioxidants', 'Apigenin', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Beverages', 'Caffeic Acids', 'Centrifugation', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Citrus', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Flavonoids', 'Food Handling', 'Food-Processing Industry', 'Freezing', 'Glucosides', 'Luteolin', 'Phenols']",Effect of processing techniques at industrial scale on orange juice antioxidant and beneficial health compounds.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12188615,2002

11925069,"The weevil Oxyops vitiosa is an Australian species imported to Florida, USA, for the biological control of the invasive weed species Melaleuca quinquenervia. Larvae of this species feed on leaves of their host and produce a shiny orange secretion that covers the integument. When this secretion is applied at physiological concentrations to dog food bait, fire ant consumption and visitation are significantly reduced. Gas chromatographic analysis indicates that the larval secretion qualitatively and quantitatively resembles the terpenoid composition of the host foliage. When the combination of 10 major terpenoids from the O. vitiosa secretion was applied to dog food bait, fire ant consumption and visitation were reduced. When these 10 terpenoids were tested individually, the sesquiterpene viridiflorol was the most active component in decreasing fire ant consumption. Fire ant visitation was initially (15 min after initiation of the study) decreased for dog food bait treated with viridiflorol and the monoterpenes 1,8-cineole and alpha-terpineol.

Annatto is used in Latin American cuisine to add a deep red color as well as distinctive flavor notes to fish, meat, and rice dishes. In the United States, annatto extracts are primarily used to impart orange/yellow hues to cheese and other dairy foods. The objective of this study was to identify and compare volatile compounds present in water- and oil-soluble annatto extracts. Volatile compounds were recovered using dynamic headspace-solvent desorption sampling and analyzed using GC-MS. Compounds were identified by comparison to a mass spectral database, Kovats indexes, and retention times of known standards. Of the 107 compounds detected, 56 compounds were tentatively identified and 51 were positively identified.

11606193,"We investigated the biochemical function of the birch pollen allergen Bet v 6 and its role in the IgE-cross-reactivity between birch pollen and plant foods, and characterized Pyr c 5, a Bet v 6-related food allergen, from pear; the proteins were expressed as His-Tag fusion proteins in Eschershia coli and purified by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography under native conditions. Nonfusion proteins were obtained by factor Xa protease treatment. The highest degree of amino-acid sequence identity of Pyr c 5 and Bet v 6 was found with a plant protein related to a defense mechanism, which we have named phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase (PCBER) based on its ability to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of 8-5' linked lignans such as dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol to give isodihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol. Enzymatic assays with recombinant Pyr c 5 and Bet v 6 showed PCBER catalytic activity for both recombinant allergens. Both Pyr c 5 and Bet v 6 allergens had similar IgE binding characteristics in immunoblotting and enzyme allergosorbent tests (EAST), and bound IgE from 10 sera of birch-pollen-allergic patients including six pear-allergic subjects. EAST inhibition experiments with Pyr c 5 as the solid phase antigen suggested that homologous allergens may be present in many vegetable foods such as apple, peach, orange, lychee fruit, strawberry, persimmon, zucchini (courgette), and carrot. In extracts of pear, apple, orange, and persimmon, the presence of proteins of approximately 30-35 kDa containing Bet v 6 cross-reactive epitopes was demonstrated with two Bet v 6-specific monoclonal antibodies.

11599982,"Dithiocarbamates are a class of fungicides extensively used in many crops worldwide. The current residue definition of dithiocarbamates in food for compliance with maximum residue limits, at national and international levels, is total residues arising from the use of any or each dithiocarbamate fungicide, determined as CS(2). The analytical method most frequently used to analyze dithiocarbamate residues in food for monitoring purposes was proposed more than 30 years ago. In this method, total dithiocarbamates are decomposed to CS(2), which is purified and reacted with a cupric reagent. The yellow complex formed is quantified by spectrophotometry. In this paper, a new reaction system for the purification and complexation of CS(2) is proposed. The new system is less fragile than the traditional design, is easier to assemble, and allows for a higher sample throughput, in addition to being of low cost. Recovery of added mancozeb, thiram, or ziram (0.15-8.0 mg/kg) in rice, beans, apple, banana, orange, papaya, tomato, cucumber, and potato ranged from 82 to 120%, with relative standard deviations from 0 to 10% (n = 3 or 5).

Differential alterations of LMWT status in various cell types of the developing embryo may underlie cell-specific sensitivity or resistance to xenobiotics and contribute to embryotoxicity. This study describes the spatial and temporal distribution of LMWTs in rat conceptuses and alterations produced by the non-teratogenic GSH modulator, acetaminophen (APAP). Pregnant female rats were given 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg APAP (po) on gestational day 9. Conceptal LMWT was localized histochemically using mercury orange in cryosections, and GSH and cysteine concentrations were measured by HPLC analysis. Mercury orange histofluorescence revealed a non-uniform distribution of LMWT in untreated conceptal tissues, with strongest staining observed in the ectoplacental cone (EPC), visceral yolk sac (VYS), and embryonic heart. Less intense staining was observed in the neuroepithelium. Following treatment with APAP, tissue-associated LMWT decreased dramatically except in the EPC, while exocoelomic fluid LMWT, and LMWT within embryonic lumens, increased. Exposure to 250 mg/kg APAP decreased embryonic GSH after 6 and 24 h by 46% and 38%, respectively. Acetaminophen (500 mg/kg) decreased embryonic and VYS cysteine content by 54% and 83%, respectively, after 24 h. Acetaminophen alters the spatial distribution of LMWT in rat conceptuses, particularly with respect to cysteine.

Then, the oranges were rinsed with Milli-Q water and left outdoors to expose them to natural ambient conditions for two weeks. In parallel, an aqueous solution containing 1 mg litre-1 of each pesticide was placed in a Pyrex flask, which was tightly closed, and exposed to the same ambient conditions. Both samples (orange peel and Milli-Q water) were analyzed periodically by gas chromatography coupled to a nitrogen-phosphorus detector. The pesticide degradation in both samples could be described using a first-order degradation curve. Half-lives varied from 14.5 to more than 30 days in aqueous solution and from 2.3 to 4.1 days in oranges for organophosphorus pesticides, while those for atrazine were 3.1 days and 14.2 days, respectively.

11234803,"A competitive, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for thiabendazole has been developed and applied to the analysis of fruit juices spiked with this fungicide. The immunoassay is based on a new monoclonal antibody derived from a hapten functionalized at the nitrogen atom in the 1-position of the thiabendazole structure. To our knowledge, such a structure has not been previously used to obtain antibodies to thiabendazole. The I50 value and the detection limit of the ELISA for standards were 0.2 and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively. Fruit juices were analyzed by diluting samples in assay buffer, without extraction or cleanup. Samples were not even centrifuged or filtered to remove fruit pulp. Under these conditions, the immunoassay was able to accurately determine thiabendazole down to 1 ng/mL in orange and grapefruit juices, down to 5 ng/mL in banana juice, and down to 20 ng/mL in apple and pear juices. Sensitivity differences of the ELISA were caused by the minimum dilution required by each juice to minimize matrix effects: 1/10 for orange and grapefruit juices, 1/50 for banana juice, and 1/100 for apple and pear juices. In an attempt to further increase the sensitivity of the immunoassay for matrixes showing the strongest interferences, apple and pear juices spiked with thiabendazole at low levels (1-20 ng/mL) were extracted with ethyl acetate before analysis. This simple procedure entailed a significant reduction of matrix effects, which in fact allowed us to determine accurately as low as 5 ng/mL thiabendazole in apple and pear juices. Irrespective of whether samples were analyzed by the direct dilution method or after extraction, the simplicity, sensitivity, and sample throughput of this monoclonal immunoassay makes it a very convenient method for the routine monitoring of thiabendazole residues in fruit juices.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D000911', 'D001628', 'D002021', 'D002851', 'D004797', 'D005638', 'D005659', 'D007202', 'D010573', 'D015203', 'D012996', 'D013827']","['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Beverages', 'Buffers', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fruit', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Solutions', 'Thiabendazole']",Determination of thiabendazole in fruit juices by a new monoclonal enzyme immunoassay.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11234803,2001

The non-photochemical method is based on the redox reaction that takes place between ascorbic acid and Fe(III), yielding dehydroascorbic acid and Fe(II). Fe(II) reacts with 1,10-phenantroline, originating the reddish orange Fe(phen)3(2+) complex (ferroin). This complex is spectrophotometrically monitored at 512 nm, and the signal is directly related to the concentration of ascorbic acid in the sample.

The pharmacokinetics of ETA in serum was determined for 12 healthy males and females in a randomized, four-period crossover study. Volunteers received single 500-mg doses of ETA either on an empty stomach (reference) or with food, orange juice, or antacids. Serum samples were collected for 48 h and assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Data were analyzed by noncompartmental and population methods. Mean test/reference ratios and 90% confidence intervals were determined. No statistically significant differences were seen in the maximum concentration of ETA (C(max)), time to maximum concentration (T(max)), or area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) between the four treatments (P > 0.05 by analysis of variance).

10942080,"Fruit of two apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) cultivars, differing in their ability to produce anthocyanin pigments when exposed to sunlight, have been studied using reflectance spectroscopy. Comparison of the spectra shows that apple anthocyanins in vivo possess a symmetric absorption band at 500-600 nm with a maximum near 550 nm. Anthocyanins considerably increase light absorption by apples. In on-tree-ripening Zhigulevskoe apples, accumulating high amounts of anthocyanin pigments, chlorophyll contents in sunlit and shaded sides of the fruits are found to be similar. In contrast, frequently considerably lower chlorophyll content is estimated in sunlit compared with shaded sides of Antonovka apples exhibiting low potential for anthocyanin formation. Sunlight also brings about an increase of carotenoid content over that of chlorophylls and accumulation of substances responsible for light absorption in the range 350-400 nm. The rates of high-light-induced chlorophyll bleaching in red zones of fruit containing anthocyanins are considerably lower than those in green zones and decrease with an increase in the pigment content. Anthocyanins show more stability to irradiation than chlorophylls. A protective function of anthocyanins against both light-induced stress in, and damage to, apples is suggested. It is proposed that anthocyanins function as an effective internal light trap filling the chlorophyll absorption gap in the green-orange part of the visible spectrum.","Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

The chromatographic analysis of flavors and off-flavors in foods usually requires that the samples first be processed to remove as many interfering compounds as possible. For analysis of foods by gas chromatography (GC), sample preparation may include mincing, homogenation, centrifugation, distillation, simple solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized-fluid extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, Soxhlet extraction, or methylation. For high-performance liquid chromatography of amines in fish, cheese, sausage and olive oil or aldehydes in fruit juice, sample preparation may include solvent extraction and derivatization. Headspace GC analysis of orange juice, fish, dehydrated potatoes, and milk requires almost no sample preparation. Purge-and-trap GC analysis of dairy products, seafoods, and garlic may require heating, microwave-mediated distillation, purging the sample with inert gases and trapping the analytes with Tenax or C18, thermal desorption, cryofocusing, or elution with ethyl acetate. Solid-phase microextraction GC analysis of spices, milk and fish can involve microwave-mediated distillation, and usually requires adsorption on poly(dimethyl)siloxane or electrodeposition on fibers followed by thermal desorption. For short-path thermal desorption GC analysis of spices, herbs, coffee, peanuts, candy, mushrooms, beverages, olive oil, honey, and milk, samples are placed in a glass-lined stainless steel thermal desorption tube, which is purged with helium and then heated gradually to desorb the volatiles for analysis.

Intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity of glutathione (GSH) and cysteine were assessed in cryostat sections of multiple biopsies obtained from 10 cervical carcinomas by the combined use of a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method and a fluorescence image analysis technique to examine the spatial distribution of NPSHs in tumor tissue. Glutathione concentrations ranged from 1.98 to 4.42 mM; significant (> or =1 mM) concentrations of cysteine, a more effective radioprotector than GSH, were found in some tumors. By HPLC, the intratumoral heterogeneity of NPSHs was relatively small compared with the intertumoral heterogeneity. The histochemical stain 1-(4-chloromercuryphenoylazo)-2-napthol (mercury orange), which binds to GSH and cysteine, was used to determine the spatial distribution of NPSHs in tumor tissue. A comparison of NPSH levels in serial cryostat sections showed a close correlation between NPSH values determined by HPLC and mercury orange fluorescence quantification. Using fluorescence image analysis, an approximately 2-fold increase of NPSHs in tumor versus nonmalignant tissue was observed in the same section.

Variation in both plasma carotenoid levels and external color may reflect different access to dietary carotenoids or individual physiological differences in the uptake and deposition of carotenoids. We compared total plasma carotenoid concentration in nestling white storks (Ciconia ciconia) from 11 Spanish colonies in two consecutive years. The main food item in one of the colonies was the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), a recently introduced species. Storks in the remaining colonies ate a variety of foods but no crayfish. Total plasma carotenoid levels in the colony where crayfish were consumed were about five times higher than in any other colony. These differences were maintained after controlling for the significant interyear variability, as well as for sex, age, and body mass of birds. Skin pigmentation also differed, being intensely orange in storks that consumed crayfish but white (unpigmented) in the remaining individuals. With thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and electronic absorption spectroscopy, astaxanthin was confirmed as the major carotenoid in crayfish as well as in the plasma, skin, and body fat of crayfish-eating storks, whereas lutein was the main carotenoid in plasma samples from the other colonies.

To verify their formation in foods, wheat bread crust and roasted cocoa as well as coffee beans, showing elevated nonenzymatic browning, were investigated by EPR spectroscopy. An intense radical was detected, which, by comparison with the radical formed upon reaction bovine serum albumin with glycolaldehyde, was identified as the protein-bound CROSSPY.

The study design was based on Youden's matched-pairs principle for collaborative tests of analytical methods. Each laboratory analyzed 12 collaborative samples of wheat, oranges, and tomatoes as blind samples. Wheat samples were extracted with acetonitrile-water (2 + 1), while orange and tomato samples were extracted with acetone. Residues were partitioned into hexane, evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator, and then dissolved in hexane. The hexane extract was partitioned with acetonitrile and cleaned up on a 5% water-deactivated Florisil column with 6% ethyl ether in hexane as eluant. Residue concentrations were determined by GC with electron capture detection with splitless injection by comparison with single-point calibration standards. The appropriate standard concentration was determined by screening sample extracts before analysis. The multiresidue method was tested over the concentration range of 0.095-1.909 mg/kg depending on the 8 different of pesticides and agricultural products analyzed in the collaborative study.

9410087,"Carotenoids are a group of fat soluble pigments which are present in the human being, both in blood, as in tissues, and which are obtained through the diet, mainly from fruits and vegetables. The interest of these compounds is due not only to the provitamin A activity of some of them, but also due to a whole series of biological activities such as: antioxidant or prooxidant, photo-protective, modulator of the immune response, anti-carcinogen, etc. The best analytical method available for the analysis of carotenoids is high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which is used in our study both for serum as for foods, and it is controlled throughout periodic quality controls. In this article we present the preliminary results of the levels of the major serum carotenoids (b-carotene, a-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene) in control subjects from five European countries, as well as indicating the major dietary contributors to the carotenoids intake in the Spanish population. The percentage of each carotenoid to the total of the carotenoids analyzed, varies according to the origin of the studied population. Ireland and the UK show a very similar carotenoids profile. France presents the highest levels of lutein and b-carotene, which are present simultaneously in green vegetables. Spain shows the lowest levels of b-carotene, along with the highest levels of b-cryptoxanthin, which in our country is supplied mainly by oranges and tangerines. The most abundant carotenoid in all countries was lycopene. The average daily intake of these carotenoids (from fresh fruits and vegetables) in our population, is 3.5 mg/day.

Reducing sugars (galactose, glucose, mannose, arabinose, xylose and ribose) were derivatized with 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-sulfonyl (DABSYL) hydrazine. The derivatives of the monosaccharides exhibited strong resonance Raman scattering at 1136 cm(-1) when Ar+ laser emission line 488.0 nm was used. A semi-microcolumn Inertsil ODS-2 (250 mm x 1.5 mm i.d.) was used to the separation of the monosaccharide derivatives. The saccharides eluted within 25 min. However the excess DABSYL hydrazine was retained strongly with a retention time of about 60 min. In order to reduce the longer analysis time, the excess DABSYL hydrazine was removed by adding glyoxylic acid and then Na2CO3 aqueous solution when the derivation reaction was finished. As a result, the analysis time was reduced to about a half of its initial run time. The sensitivity of resonance Raman detection greater two orders of magnitude than refractive index (RI) detection. The detection limit of glucose is 10 ng (5.5 pmol).

The first method is based on the reaction of the basic drug with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) in acetonitrile. The orange-red colour formed due to the formation of charge-transfer complex showed maximum absorbance at 460 nm. The second method is based upon the interaction of the basic drug in dry chloroform with bromophenol blue (BPB) in the same solvent to produce a stable yellow ion-pair complex which absorbs at 410 nm. Beer's law was obeyed for both methods and the relative standard deviations were found to be less than 1%.

9247600,"Coumarin-related compounds, auraptene and umbelliferone, have been isolated from the cold-pressed oil of natsumikan (Citrus natsudaidai HAYATA), and tested as inhibitors of tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced Epstein-Barr virus activation in Raji cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of auraptene (18 microM) was almost equal to that of genistein. Umbelliferone, which lacks a geranyloxyl group present in auraptene, was less active (IC50 = 450 microM). In a two-stage carcinogenesis experiment with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene (topical application at 0.19 mumol) and TPA (topical application at 1.6 nmol) in ICR mouse skin, topical application of auraptene (at 160 nmol) significantly reduced tumor incidence and the numbers of tumors per mouse by 27% (P < 0.01) and 23% (P < 0.05), respectively. Auraptene at a concentration of 50 microM markedly suppressed superoxide (O2-) generation induced by 100 microM TPA in differentiated human promyelocytic HL-60 cells. Having no O2(-)-scavenging potential, auraptene may inhibit the multicomponent NADPH oxidase system. Inhibition of intracellular hydroperoxide formation in differentiated HL-60 cells by auraptene was also confirmed by flow-cytometric analysis using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate as a fluorescence probe. Quantitative analyses using high-performance liquid chromatography showed the occurrence of auraptene not only in both the peels and sarcocarps of natsumikan, but also in those of hassaku orange (C. hassaku) and grapefruit (C. paradisi), and even in their bottled fresh juice form.

9134765,"An industrial site contaminated with a mixture of volatile organic compounds in its subsurface differed from previously reported locations in that the contamination consisted of a mixture of chlorinated, brominated, and non-halogenated aromatic and aliphatic solvents in an alluvial aquifer. The source area was adjacent to a river. Of the contaminants present in the aquifer, benzene, toluene, and chlorobenzene (BTC) were of primary concern. Studies of the physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics of site groundwater were conducted. The studies concentrated on BTC, but also addressed the fate of the other aquifer VOCs. Gas chromatographic analyses performed on laboratory microcosms demonstrated that subsurface microorganisms were capable of BTC degradation. Mineralization of BTC was demonstrated by the release of 14CO2 from radiolabelled BTC. In the field, distribution patterns of nutrients and electron acceptors were consistent with expression of in situ microbial metabolic activity: methane, conductivity, salinity and o-phosphate concentrations were all positively correlated with contaminant concentration; while oxidation-reduction potential, nitrate, dissolved oxygen and sulfate concentrations were negatively correlated. Total aerobes, aerotolerant anaerobes, BTC-specific degraders, and acridine orange direct microscopic microorganism counts were strongly and positively correlated with field contaminant concentrations. The relative concentrations of benzene and toluene were lower away from the core of the plume compared to the less readily metabolized compound, chlorobenzene. Hydrodynamic modeling of electron-acceptor depletion conservatively estimated that 450 kg of contaminant have been removed from the subsurface yearly. Models lacking a biodegradation term predicted that 360 kg of contaminant would reach the river annually, which would result in measurable contaminant concentrations. River surveillance, however, has only rarely detected these compounds in the sediment and then only at trace concentrations. Thus, the combination of field modeling, laboratory studies, and site surveillance data confirm that significant in situ biodegradation of the contaminants has occurred. These studies establish the presence of intrinsic bioremediation of groundwater contaminants in this unusual industrial site subsurface habitat.",Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,"['D000332', 'D000693', 'D001419', 'D001554', 'D001673', 'D002245', 'D002722', 'D002849', 'D015169', 'D004785', 'D004787', 'D019015', 'D006838', 'D007220', 'D008697', 'D009566', 'D010084', 'D010100', 'D010710', 'D012965', 'D013431', 'D014050', 'D014867', 'D014871']","['Aerobiosis', 'Anaerobiosis', 'Bacteria', 'Benzene', 'Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Chlorobenzenes', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Industrial Waste', 'Methane', 'Nitrates', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen', 'Phosphates', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Sulfates', 'Toluene', 'Water', 'Water Microbiology']",Intrinsic bioremediation in a solvent-contaminated alluvial groundwater.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9134765,1997

Using the PBM system, the reference spectra of the computerized Anaheim data base were fingerprint matched to the fortified residues at the 50 ppb level. For most commodities, the PBM quality value was above 90% with the exception of whole oranges. The study demonstrates that the produce matrix of individual commodities varies considerably. The method met difficulties in the analysis of citrus due to the citrus peels. Although the method is commodity dependent, the clean-up procedure has reduced matrix interference in most cases.

A dramatic increase in its proteolytic susceptibility was seen at 1.1 to 1.2 mol/L guanidine HCl, a concentration causing only a 3- to 4-nm shift in vWF emission maxima. Although vWF molecules refolded as guanidine HCl was removed by dialysis, the refolding was accompanied only by a partial recovery of the proteolytic resistance. The plasma protease, partially purified by approximately 900 folds by Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration, Matrex gel orange A dye affinity chromatography, and Q Sepharose anion exchange, had a molecular mass of approximately 200 kD and was inhibited by EDTA, EGTA, or 1,10-phenanthroline. The inhibition by EGTA or EDTA could be reversed by Ca2+ but not by mg2+. It was not inhibited by a panel of synthetic and natural protease inhibitors or adsorbed by gelatin-agarose, and it was present in plasmas deficient in proteins involved in coagulation and anticoagulation. The vWF fragments generated by the protease, as mapped by peptide-specific antibodies VP-1 and LJ-7745, were in distinguishable from the natural fragments but distinct from those produced by plasmin. High molecular weight endothelial vWF, after exposure to guanidine HCLI or high shear stress, was cleaved by the protease to smaller forms. These results support the model that endothelial secreted vWF is converted to multimers by a novel plasma metalloproteinase. Although native vWF exists in a conformation relatively resistant to cleavage, an alteration in the conformation by shear stress can lead to enhanced proteolytic susceptibility. This model may explain the decrease in vWF multimer sizes in various clinical conditions.",Blood,"['D051722', 'D000071120', 'D002118', 'D002846', 'D002850', 'D002852', 'D004492', 'D004533', 'D010450', 'D005341', 'D019791', 'D006146', 'D006801', 'D008666', 'D008954', 'D008970', 'D010449', 'D010618', 'D011480', 'D011487', 'D013314', 'D013379', 'D014841']","['ADAM Proteins', 'ADAMTS13 Protein', 'Calcium', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Edetic Acid', 'Egtazic Acid', 'Endopeptidases', 'Fibrinolysin', 'Guanidine', 'Guanidines', 'Humans', 'Metalloendopeptidases', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phenanthrolines', 'Protease Inhibitors', 'Protein Conformation', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Substrate Specificity', 'von Willebrand Factor']",Physiologic cleavage of von Willebrand factor by a plasma protease is dependent on its conformation and requires calcium ion.,"[None, None, 'Q000502', None, None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000097', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000037', None, None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'physiology', None, None, None, 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'blood', 'metabolism', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', None, None, None, 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8639782,1996

This governorate is located near one of the biggest pesticide factories in Egypt. Organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides were monitored, including those that have been prohibited from use in Egypt. Human milk samples (31 samples) from Kafr El-Zayat were compared with 11 samples collected from Cairo. Data were compared with results from studies performed in 1987 and 1990. The present study showed that aldrin and dieldrin, heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide, and endrin residues have been eliminated from human milk. Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of DDT complex and gamma-HCH by breast-fed infants in Kafr El-Zayat were 85.96 and 3.1% of the respective acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). beta-HCH residues showed an increasing pattern, especially in human milk samples from Cairo. DDT complex and HCH isomers in orange, spinach, lettuce, potatoes, and clover samples ranged from undetectable to very low concentrations. Higher levels of DDT and HCH were detected, but aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, and the heptachlors were not detected in food of animal origin. Residues in fish samples were below maximum residue limits established by some developed countries. Those in animal milk samples approached the extraneous residue limits of the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues. HCH residues in soil were negligible, but DDT residues in soil were somewhat higher. Among water samples, groundwater samples had the highest residues of HCHs and DDTs, followed by Nile River water and then tap water. However, the organochlorine pesticide residues were found at concentrations below the maximum allowable limits set by the World Health Organization for drinking water. Among 12 organophosphorus pesticides monitored as parent compounds, dimethoate, malathion, methamidophos, and chlorpyrifos residues were detected in low concentrations in soil samples from a pesticide factory.

Ethanol was determined in venous blood at various times after the start of drinking by headspace gas chromatography. All subjects felt less intoxicated when alcohol was ingested after breakfast compared with drinking on an empty stomach. The peak BAC (+/- SD) was 67 +/- 9.5 mg/dL (ethanol + food) compared with 104 +/- 16.5 mg/dL when the drinking occurred after an overnight fast (P < 0.001).

8181633,"The effects of domestic marmalade-making procedures on residues of imazalil, 2-phenylphenol and thiabendazole in 'sweet' oranges were investigated by comparing residue levels in raw fruit and in marmalades, prepared by heating the oranges with water and sugar for about 4 h in a preserving pan on a gas ring or for about 1 h in a microwave oven. Determination of residues in raw oranges and in marmalades was carried out by extraction with dichloromethane, followed by clean-up and reversed phase HPLC with UV detection for imazalil and fluorescence detection for 2-phenylphenol and thiabendazole. Residue analysis showed that the extent of carry-through of imazalil, 2-phenylphenol and thiabendazole residues into the marmalades depended on the method of marmalade-making and the nature of the fungicide. Persistence of fungicides was higher in the marmalade prepared in the microwave oven than in that prepared in the preserving pan. An increase (about 50%) in levels of imazalil in the fruit portions of marmalades compared with raw fruit residue levels indicated that imazalil was more readily extracted from oranges after processing. Comparison of 2-phenylphenol levels in raw fruit and fruit portions of marmalades showed that the longer exposure to heat, needed for marmalade-making in a preserving pan, reduced residue levels more severely (48%) than cooking in the microwave oven (13%). Thiabendazole levels in the fruit portion of marmalade prepared in the microwave oven stayed the same as in the raw fruit, but cooking in the preserving pan decreased residue levels by about 22%.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D001713', 'D002853', 'D002957', 'D003296', 'D005506', 'D005659', 'D007093', 'D010573', 'D013827']","['Biphenyl Compounds', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Citrus', 'Cooking', 'Food Contamination', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Imidazoles', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Thiabendazole']","The effect of home processing on postharvest fungicide residues in citrus fruit: residues of imazalil, 2-phenylphenol and thiabendazole in 'home-made' marmalade, prepared from late Valencia oranges.","['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8181633,1994

The method is based on the extraction of cadmium with HDPBA into chloroform at pH 9.0 +/- 0.2 and simultaneous spectrophotometric determination with PAN. The binary Cd(II)-HDPBA complex extracted into chloroform has a molar absorptivity of 1.96 x 10(4) L/mol/cm at lambda max 400 nm. The sensitivity of the yellow Cd(II)-HDPBA complex was increased remarkably by the addition of PAN to the binary complex.

These autoantibodies thus belong to the ANCA family, but their antigen specificity differs from the already characterized ANCA antigens. We have found that the same ANCA antigen target, named UC-antigen, was recognized by serum IgG from patients with UC, CD and PSC. It was purified by Matrex Gel Orange A dye affinity chromatography and subsequent immunoabsorption of contaminant proteinase 3 with immobilized anti-proteinase 3 MoAb. The identity between this UC antigen and cathepsin G was demonstrated by their coelution from Matrex Gel Orange A column and the parallel titration of cathepsin G-specific enzymatic activity and UC-ANCA binding, both in partially purified UC antigen and in highly pure cathepsin G. Furthermore, the use of cathepsin G ELISA confirmed that UC, CD and PSC patients' IgG did indeed bind to cathepsin G. Comparison of the results obtained with azurophilic granule- and cathepsin G-ELISA as well as inhibition of ANCA binding by anti-cathepsin G polyclonal antibodies, revealed that in some patients cathepsin G is the main azurophilic granule target of ANCA while others have other ANCA specificities.

Both culture filtrates showed macerating activity at low pH on cucumber, potato, and orange tissues. The physicochemical properties of the enzyme obtained from both culture methods were identical, as well as its catalytic properties, which were assayed by different methods. The molecular mass of the PNL obtained by gel filtration chromatography was 22 kDa; the isoelectric point was 8.6, as determined by chromatofocusing; and the enzyme was able to catalyze the eliminative cleavage of pectins with low (37%) and high (from 54 to 82%) degrees of esterification. The PNL produced in liquid medium showed a K(m) for pectin (degree of esterification, 70%) of 3.2 mg/ml, and the optimum pH was 6.0 to 7.0. This enzyme was stable at 50 degrees C and at pH 8.0.

The comminuted food sample as an aqueous sodium sulfate slurry is equilibrated with stirring for 1 h at room temperature before a 1 mL headspace aliquot is removed and injected using a modified on-column syringe needle. Methyl bromide is cryogenically focussed at -60 degrees C and then eluted by temperature programming. The procedure requires blending of soft samples, e.g. raisins, prunes, or oranges, and ultrasonic homogenization of hard samples, e.g. wheat, cocoa beans, corn, or nuts, with portions of water and ice so the final temperature of the food-water slurry is less than 1 degree C. A 20 g aliquot (4 g food) is then added to a cold headspace vial containing 4 g sodium sulfate. Losses of MB during a 3.5 min ultrasonic homogenization of wheat were 11% at 0.95 ppb and 4.4% at 4.8 ppb. For flour, cocoa, and finely divided spices, which do not require blending, 4 g is added to the cold headspace vial containing 16 mL cold water and 4 g sodium sulfate. Studies show that comminution of wheat or peanuts must be carried out to release MB trapped within the food so the headspace equilibrium can be attained in 1 h as well as to obtain homogeneous samples and representative sampling.

The semipurified fluorophores fall into four categories based upon their spectral properties: green-emitting fluorophores, a golden yellow-emitting fluorophore, yellow-green-emitting fluorophores and orange-red-emitting fluorophores. All share common absorbance peaks around 280- and 330 nm, and the orange-red-emitting fluorophores also exhibit a strong absorbance peak at 420 nm. No significant visible-emitting fluorophores were detected in the methanol-water phase of these extracts. While these fluorophores are abundant in extracts from adult-derived RPE, most of the fluorophores occur in much lower amounts in RPE extracts from human donors under 10 yr of age. Eyes from child human donors also have much less RPE lipofuscin than those from adult donors, suggesting that most of the fluorophores are lipofuscin derived. This interpretation is supported by the previous finding that all of the fluorophores from whole RPE are also present in extracts of purified lipofuscin granules. Characterization of the chromatographic and spectral properties of the chloroform-soluble fluorescent components from the human RPE provides an important tool for determining the mechanism of RPE lipofuscin fluorophore formation.

From this screen a 'negative' (Matrex Gel Purple A) and a 'positive' (Matrex Gel Orange B) adsorbent were found to be the best in terms of overall purification and yield and were therefore combined to give the best purification. 2. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides was purified approx. 56-fold in a two-step tandem chromatographic system using Matrex Gel Purple A followed by Matrex Gel Orange B chromatography to a specific activity of 228 units/mg of protein in a final yield of 73%. 3. A study of the elution characteristics of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase bound to Matrex Gel Orange B by KCl (pulse and gradient) and biospecific eluents (pulse) was carried out. NADP+, NADPH and adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate were found to be the only effective biospecific eluents. A pulse of 50 microM-NADP+ (1/2 column vol.) was found to give a better purification than a 0-1 M-KCl gradient and therefore was the preferred method of elution. 4. Presaturation of the enzyme with various nucleotides was carried out to determine the effect on the subsequent binding of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to Matrex Gel Orange B. The results of these and biospecific-elution studies lead us to propose two possible schemes to explain the mechanism of the dye-protein interaction. 5.

6815256,"Triplet flash photolysis techniques, coupled with quenching of the triplets by molecular oxygen, are utilized as probes of the microenvironment of polycyclic aromatic molecules bound covalently and non-covalently to DNA. The triplet-oxygen quenching properties of the following adducts in aqueous solutions at 25 +/- 1 degrees C were investigated: covalent adducts derived from the reaction of (+/-)-7 beta,8 alpha-dihydroxy-9 alpha,10 alpha-epoxy-7,8,9, 10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BaPDE) and of (+/-)-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (BaPE) with DNA, and non-covalent intercalation complexes of acridine orange (AO) and DNA. In all cases the quenching follows the Stern-Volmer quenching law with a quenching constant of KTO2 approximately equal to 10(9) M-1 X S-1 for the covalent BaPDE-DNA and BaPE-DNA complexes in aqueous solution. This value of KTO2 is characteristic of free molecules (not bound to DNA) and indicates that the pyrene chromophore is totally accessible to oxygen, and is thus not located at an intercalation-type of binding site in these covalent adducts. In contrast, the AO-DNA complexes are characterized by values of KTO2 approximately equal to 10(8) M-1 X S-1 indicating that the intercalated AO molecules are about ten times less accessible to molecular oxygen than free AO molecules. The KTO2 values for the covalent BaPDE-DNA and BaPE-DNA adducts decrease when the DNA concentration is increased in the 1 X 10(-4)-3 X 10(-3) M range (expressed in nucleotide concentration). This effect is attributed to intermolecular DNA-DNA interactions in which segments of adjacent DNA molecules tend to cover the pyrene chromophores on other strands, thus decreasing their accessibility to oxygen. In contrast the values of KTO2 for the non-covalent AO-DNA intercalation complexes are independent of DNA concentration, as expected for interior binding sites.",Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods,"['D015123', 'D000165', 'D001580', 'D002273', 'D055598', 'D002621', 'D004247', 'D005453', 'D007700', 'D009153', 'D010100', 'D010782', 'D013053']","['7,8-Dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene 9,10-oxide', 'Acridine Orange', 'Benzopyrenes', 'Carcinogens', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'DNA', 'Fluorescence', 'Kinetics', 'Mutagens', 'Oxygen', 'Photolysis', 'Spectrophotometry']",Probing the microenvironment of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-DNA adducts by triplet excited state quenching methods.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6815256,1983

Examination of yellow membranes, stained and unstained, under fluorescent microscopy reveals on orange-red fluorescent material heterogeneously dispersed within the membranes. Homogenates of lungs with YHM and HM were extracted with chloroform and tested spectrophotometrically, by thin layer chromatography, and for diazotized sulfanilic acid reactivity. Spectrophotometric profiles of YHM differed from those of HM by a unique absorption shoulder at 454 nm. in the former. This shoulder corresponded to the absorbance of unconjugated bilirubin. This profile could be reproduced by adding purified unconjugated bilirubin to non-YHM lung homogenate prior to extraction. Thin layer chromatography of the extracted YHM material produced two unique spots not found in extracts prepared from normal or HM-diseased lungs. These spots could be duplicated by thin layer chromatography using pure unconjugated bilirubin. The spots also fluoresced orange-red, the same color initially observed in the membranous preparations under fluorescent microscopy. Additional in vitro binding studies suggest that polymyxin, a decapeptide antibiotic used in endotracheal irrigation of newborn infants, binds bilirubin in pH-dependent, small molecular ratios.

925761,"There is substantial evidence that natural vitamin B-6 exists largely in a bound form. It has been shown that the principal modes of binding represents an interaction of pyridoxal and/or pyridoxal phosphate with protein moieties. The nature and extent of binding of different forms of the vitamin in orange juice was investigated. Studies employing ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration and, membrane dialysis of this food product suggested binding to a molecule of less than 3,500 daltons molecular weight. Binding was resistant to protease treatment although susceptible to heat-acid hydrolysis. Separation of pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine species of the vitamin by ion exchange chromatography was followed by fluorometric analysis with and without preparative hydrolysis. Extensive and equal binding of both pyridoxal and pyridoxine was observed by this method. Thus, the binder(s) of vitamin B-6 in orange juice is a small dialyzable molecule which is heat stable, binds both pyridoxal and pyridoxine and is non-protein in nature.",The Journal of nutrition,"['D002957', 'D003956', 'D004355', 'D008970', 'D010940', 'D011732', 'D011736']","['Citrus', 'Dialysis', 'Drug Stability', 'Molecular Weight', 'Plant Proteins', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Pyridoxine']",Characterization of food binding of vitamin B-6 in orange juice.,"['Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/925761,1978

Thiourea is separated on a silica gel plate with methanol-chloroform (10 + 90), and the spots are characterized with 2,6-dichloroquinone chloroimide; this colorimetric reaction is unstable, so thiourea is quantitated on the chromatogram by direct ultraviolet reflectance spectrometric measurements at 240 nm. Comparison between this method and the AOAC colorimetric method shows interferences and higher results in the colorimetric assay. By slightly modifying the extraction technique, such as purifying the extract on an alumina column, it is possible to decrease these interferences and to avoid erroneous results with the AOAC colorimetric method.

Furthermore, experiments were done in order to determine the reaction conditions (pH8.8 in the reactor, casein concentration 5%, 40 degrees C). Determining the molecular weight of Alcalase (43,000) suggested the choice of ultrafiltration membrane PM 30. Sutdies of continuous proteolysis with the chemically stabilized enzyme retained by the ultrafiltration reactor showed that protease reuse for seven days at 40 degrees C is possible and that the growth of microorganisms is practically inhibited under these conditions.

Protein end-group procedures included pH 2.8 Biebrich scarlet (for basic groups), mercury orange (for sulfhydryl groups), and mercury orange after thioglycolate reduction (for the sum of sulfhydryl and disulfide groups). With the exception of the comparison between Feulgen-stained 2C liver and kidney nuclei, the integrated extinction values obtained for nuclei of a given organ differed significantly from the measurements of nuclei from other organs, regardless of the staining procedure. Furthermore, the integrated extinction values for 2C nuclei were highest in larger, more vesicular nuclei (from liver and kidney) and lowest in condensed thymocyte nuclei, except in the case of measurements of the disulfide content of the nuclei. In this instance, the values of integrated extinction were highest in condensed thymocyte nuclei, intermediate in kidney nuclei, and lowest in 2C liver nuclei. When 2C, 4C, and 8C liver nuclei were compared, the integrated extinction values of 4C nuclei were found to be approximately twice those of 2C nuclei whose disulfide and Feulgen values were, respectively, higher and lower than expected. The greater disulfide values and reduced Feulgen values obtained in thymocyte and 8C liver nuclei might be related to a greater degree of chromatin condensation in these nuclei, and therefore, to a reduction or selective restriction of their RNA transcriptional capacities.",Journal of morphology,"['D000818', 'D002467', 'D002843', 'D004220', 'D006651', 'D006657', 'D007668', 'D008099', 'D051379', 'D008806', 'D011506', 'D013053', 'D013438', 'D013950']","['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromatin', 'Disulfides', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Histones', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Proteins', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds', 'Thymus Gland']",Microspectrophotometric estimates of non-histone proteins in cell nuclei displaying differing degrees of chromatin condensation.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1111421,1975

4160916,"The stacking coefficients (K's) of nucleic acids have been thought to influence the color contrast between DNA and RNA in tissue sections stained with metachromatic dyes. This idea was tested by titrating toluidine blue (TB) and acridine orange (AO) in solution against DNA and RNA, native or treated with formaldehyde, acrolein, or Carnoy's fluid. Absorption spectra at varying polymer-dye ratios were used to compute K values by the methods of Bradley and colleagues. Results with both dyes fit Bradley's stacking equations. Fixatives did not block dye-binding sites but markedly altered K values. K of DNA was low, unaffected by aldehyde fixative, increased by Carnoy's fluid or heat denaturation. K of RNA was higher than that of DNA and was increased greatly by formaldehyde, almost as much by acrolein, considerably less by Carnoy's fluid. Aldehyde effects were partially reversed upon removal of aldehyde by dialysis. These observations accord with known effects of aldehydes and denaturation upon nucleic acid conformation. Differences between K's of DNA and RNA were greater after aldehyde treatment than after Carnoy's, and were greater with AO than with TB. This is generally consistent with the magnitude of the color contrasts observed in tissues.
