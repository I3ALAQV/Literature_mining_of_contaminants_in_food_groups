35293514,"Increasing the rates of drug resistant bacteria, having adverse effects and also high costs of antibiotics lead to essential oils (EOs) with antibacterial properties have gained importance. The present study was predicted to evaluate antibacterial activity of cinnamon, lavender, tea tree, lemon, coconut, oregano, mint, laurel and eucalyptus EOs alone and in combination. Chemical components of effective EOs were examined through gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assays were used to identify antibacterial effects of EOs against bacterial strains. The Fractional Inhibitory Concentration index (FICI) of the binary combinations of EOs was determined by checkerboard method. Carvacrol, linalool, linalyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, cinnamaldehyde, terpinen-4-ol and p-cymene were found main components of EOs. Oregano, cinnamon and tea tree EOs exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity with the MIC range between 0.03125-1.00% (v/v). Tea tree/lavender and cinnamon/lavender mixtures showed a synergistic effect against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Oregano with tea tree and laurel exhibited a synergistic effect against Staphylococcus aureus. Oregano showed a synergistic effect when combined with cinnamon, lavender and tea tree against S.agalactiae.

35206026,"Spices and aromatic herbs have always had great historical importance in human nutrition. Their use has been documented for centuries as a rich source of bioactive compounds; they have been used for their health benefits and also for flavoring or coloring food. However, despite the many health properties linked to the use of spices and aromatic herbs, these can represent biological hazards and can contain chemical substances of concern. Certainly, monitoring potential health hazards in spices and aromatic herbs includes microbiological safety and also the content of inorganic substances: both represent a key step. This research aims at monitoring the compliance of various spices and aromatic herbs from a non-European country market (namely: black cumin seeds, Iranian Tokhme Sharbati, clove buds, Shahjeera, Abbaszadeh saffron, organic fenugreek, whole black pepper, cinnamon, Abthul Ahmar (Asario), Ajwan seeds, whole coriander seeds, black sesame seeds, Sabja seeds) with the current European Union (EU) and WHO regulations, when available, regarding mineral and microbiological parameters. In particular, microbiological assays using rapid and conventional methods, and trace mineral determination by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were performed. Results show the safety of the tested spices, given that the microbiological parameters were within the legal microbiological criteria set by the European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2073/2005 and its amendment Regulation (EC) No. 1441/2007. With reference to potentially toxic Cd, Pb, As, Hg, these were within the limits set by the European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006 and its amendments, Regulation (EU) No. 1317/2021 and Regulation (EU) No. 1323/2021, and WHO.

34689906,"Coumarin is a phytotoxin found in the popular spice cinnamon, which is used to flavor many Asian curry dishes. In this work, we developed and compared the analytical performance of reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) and sweeping-micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) methods for the determination of coumarin in complex curry (gravy) samples. Using a matrix matched sample (curry after solvent extraction with methanol and diluted with 100 mM phosphoric acid), the intra-day and inter-day repeatability of retention/migration time and (corrected) peak area for both methods were acceptable (%RSD (n=6) ≤ 5%). The linear range and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were an order of magnitude better in RP-LC (RP-LC linear range = 0.11-108 mg/kg, LOQ = 0.11 mg/kg) (Sweeping-MEKC linear range = 2.16-216 mg/kg, LOQ = 2.16 mg/kg). However, the limit of detection (S/N=3) and LOQ in sweeping-MEKC was 0.65 mg/kg and 2.16 mg/kg, which were sufficient to report the levels of coumarin ≥ the European limit of 2 mg/kg in foods. During the analysis of 25 curry samples, relatively similar results for sweeping-MEKC and RP-LC were obtained for 6 samples that contained coumarin >LOQ of sweeping-MEKC. Interferences in RP-LC lead to significant overestimation of coumarin levels in 3 samples. Coumarin levels above the EU limit was found in 6 curry samples using the more selective sweeping-MEKC. This work should also raise public awareness on the presence of potentially high levels of coumarin in some foods.",Journal of chromatography.

34474871,"This study aimed to fabricate cinnamon essential oil (CO)-laden 45S5 bioactive glass (BG)/soy protein (SP) scaffolds exhibiting antioxidant and antibacterial activity. In this regard, 45S5 BG-based scaffolds were produced by the foam replica method, and subsequently the scaffolds were coated with various concentrations of CO (2.5, 5 and 7 (v/v) %) incorporated SP solution. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the CO-laden SP effectively attached to the 45S5 BG scaffold struts. The presence of 45S5 BG, SP and CO was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Compressive strength results indicated that SP based coatings improved the scaffolds' mechanical properties compared to uncoated BG scaffolds. The loading efficiency and releasing behaviour of the different CO concentrations were tested by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The results showed that CO incorporated scaffolds have controlled releasing behaviour over seven days. Furthermore, the coating on the scaffold surfaces slightly retarded, but it did not inhibit, the in vitro bioactivity of the scaffolds. Moreover, the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of CO was studied. The free radical scavenging activity measured by DPPH was 5 ± 1, 41 ± 3, 44 ± 1 and 43 ± 1 % for BGSP, CO2.5, CO5 and CO7, respectively. The antioxidant activity was thus enhanced by incorporating CO. Agar diffusion and colony counting results indicated that the incorporation of CO increased the antibacterial activity of scaffolds against S. aureus and E. coli. In addition, cytotoxicity of the scaffolds was investigated using MG-63 osteoblast-like cells. The results showed that the BG-SP scaffold was non-toxic under the investigated conditions, whereas dose-dependent toxicity was observed in CO-laden scaffolds. Considered together, the developed phytotherapeutic agent laden 45S5 BG-based scaffolds are promising for bone tissue engineering exhibiting capability to combat bone infections and to protect against oxidative stress damage.","Materials science & engineering.

33439867,"Periodontal diseases are bacteria-induced inflammatory disorders that lead to the destruction of the tooth-supporting tissues. Active compounds endowed with a capacity to regulate the inflammatory response are regarded as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of periodontal diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize the anti-inflammatory properties of a polyphenolic cinnamon fraction. Chromatographic and mass spectrometry analyses of the polyphenolic composition of the cinnamon fraction revealed that phenolic acids, flavonoids (flavonols, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols), and procyanidins make up 9.22%, 0.72%, and 10.63% of the cinnamon fraction, respectively. We used a macrophage model stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from either Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or Escherichia coli to show that the cinnamon fraction dose-dependently reduced IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α secretion. Evidence was brought that this inhibition of cytokine secretion may result from the ability of the fraction to prevent LPS-induced NF-κB activation. We also showed that the cinnamon fraction reduces LPS binding to monocytes, which may contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties. Lastly, using a competitor assay, it was found that the cinnamon fraction may represent a natural PPAR-γ ligand. Within the limitations of this in vitro study, the cinnamon fraction was shown to exhibit a therapeutic potential for the treatment of periodontal diseases due to its anti-inflammatory properties.",PloS one,"['D016976', 'D000872', 'D000893', 'D045744', 'D002851', 'D027424', 'D005419', 'D006801', 'D015850', 'D016209', 'D008070', 'D008264', 'D013058', 'D016328', 'D024301', 'D010936', 'D059808', 'D044945', 'D014409']","['Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans', 'Anthocyanins', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cinnamomum', 'Flavonoids', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-8', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Macrophages', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'NF-kappa B', 'Plant Bark', 'Plant Extracts', 'Polyphenols', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",A polyphenolic cinnamon fraction exhibits anti-inflammatory properties in a monocyte/macrophage model.,"['Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000494', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000378']","['metabolism', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', 'cytology', None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439867,2021

The physicochemical properties, release kinetics and antimicrobial activity of the fabricated gels were investigated. The hardness of the KC gels increased with composite concentration in the range of 1.0-3.0% (w/v) and thereafter decreased. A similar trend was observed for the gumminess and chewiness, whereas the gel springiness remained essentially constant. The CEO/HPCD composite also enhanced the fluidity of the system, and the syneresis was positively correlated with the composite concentration. The controlled release of CEO from the gels was affected by the relative humidity (RH) and CEO content.

32719085,"Commercial formulations of 29 commonly used herbal supplements (HSs) and grapefruit juice were evaluated for drug interaction potential via quantification of their CYP3A inhibitory potential in two in vitro experimental models of human small intestine, cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa (CHIM), and cryopreserved human enterocytes (CHEs). Two CYP3A substrates were used-in the studies with CHIM, CYP3A activity was quantified via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry quantification of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, whereas in CHE, luciferin-IPA metabolism to luciferin was quantified by luminescence. Upon treatment of CHIM with the estimated lumen concentration of the HS upon each oral administration (manufacturers' recommended dosage dissolved in 200 ml of culture medium), >80% CYP3A inhibition was observed for green tea extract, St. John's wort, valerian root, horehound, and grapefruit juice. Less than 50% inhibition was observed for fenugreek, aloe vera, guarana, soy isoflavone, maca, echinacea, spirulina, evening primrose, milk thistle, cranberry, red yeast rice, rhodiola, ginkgo biloba, turmeric, curcumin, white kidney bean, garlic, cinnamon, saw palmetto berries, panax ginseng, black elderberry, wheat grass juice, flaxseed oil, black cohosh, and ginger root. The results were confirmed in a a dose-response study with HSs obtained from three suppliers for the four inhibitory HSs (green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, valerian root) and three representative noninhibitory HSs (black cohosh, black elderberry, echinacea). Similar results were obtained with the inhibitory HSs in CHE. The results illustrate that CHIM and CHE represent physiologically relevant in vitro experimental models for the evaluation of drug interaction potential of herbal supplements. Based on the results, green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, and valerian root may cause drug interactions with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates, as was observed for grapefruit juice. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In vitro evaluation of 29 popular herbal supplements in cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa identified green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, and valerian root to have CYP3A inhibitory potential similar to that for grapefruit juice, suggesting their potential to have clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates.

The use of predictive metabolite pathway analysis and description of produced lipids enabled the evaluation of the stress symptoms shown by bacteria. This study suggests that bacteria exposed to cinnamaldehyde could reorganize their outer membrane as a physical barrier against stress factors.

31029699,"The cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is one of the most important ectoparasites for livestock in tropical and subtropical areas around the world. This tick economically impacts cattle production by reducing weight gain and milk production. Moreover, it is a vector of pathogens causing diseases such as babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Conventional tick control relies mainly on the use of chemical acaricides; however, their intensive use has led to the rapid appearance of resistant tick populations. It is therefore necessary to look for alternative tick control products. In that sense, plant extracts might represent a promising source of new acaricides. Previously, we reported a significant acaricide effect of essential oils from selected plant species. In the present study, we used a mixture design approach to develop phyto-formulations by combining individual essential oils. We produced several mixtures at 10% containing different proportions of individual essential oils (ranging from 0 to 1) from cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), cumin (Cuminum cyminum) and allspice (Pimenta dioica) and tested their acaricidal activity against R. microplus ticks by means of larval packet test (LPT) and adult immersion test (AIT) assays. The optimal mixture predicted against R. microplus was composed of 66%, 17% and 17% of essential oils from C. zeylanicum, C. cyminum and P. dioica, respectively. We generated an estimated response surface contour plot that estimates 80%-100% acaricidal efficacy. In the optimal mixture 34 compounds were identified, which represent 98.65% of the total composition, with cinnamaldehyde (37.77%), β-caryophyllene (13.92%), methyl eugenol (12.27%) and cuminaldehyde (8.99%) being the major components. Next, we developed emulsions by combining the optimal mixture with several surfactants and determined particle size, Zeta potential, stability and bioactivity. Emulsions containing 2% and 5% Tween 20 or Tween 80 remain stable after 14 days at 54 °C. Finally, optimized emulsion retained a high acaricidal activity against larval and adult R. microplus ticks. Taken together, our findings showed the usefulness of mixture design method for the development of essential oil mixtures with potent acaricidal activity. These formulations have the potential to successfully control tick infestations.",Experimental parasitology,"['D056810', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D001096', 'D002417', 'D002418', 'D002935', 'D045424', 'D028527', 'D004655', 'D005260', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D009822', 'D027841', 'D010936', 'D048494', 'D012639', 'D013983', 'D013984']","['Acaricides', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Arachnid Vectors', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cuminum', 'Emulsions', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Pimenta', 'Plant Extracts', 'Rhipicephalus', 'Seeds', 'Tick Control', 'Tick Infestations']",Development of essential oil-based phyto-formulations to control the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus using a mixture design approach.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000469', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000517']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'parasitology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'prevention & control']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029699,2019

30637439,"The Nrf2 signaling pathway is highly significant for redox homeostasis. Hence, nutrients and drugs activating Nrf2 can prevent oxidative stress-mediated medical conditions. After activation, Nrf2 accumulates in the cell nucleus; therefore, stimulation of Nrf2 by food components and drugs is usually monitored by measuring nuclear Nrf2 levels. The present study developed a targeted mass spectrometry method for the highly reliable quantification of nuclear Nrf2 levels. Three Nrf2-specific peptides were detected after enzymatic digestion of the nuclear fraction by the developed protocol for micro-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode (microLC-MS/MS-sMRM). The method also identified nuclear Nrf2 unequivocally and specifically in the SDS-PAGE fraction of 100-150 kDa. Moreover, highly precise and linear relative quantification was achieved (mean relative standard deviation 8.3%; coefficient of determination 0.998). Incubation experiments in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells revealed significantly up to 6-fold elevated nuclear Nrf2 levels after stimulation with 10 μM carnosol (rosemary), 10 μM sulforaphane (broccoli), or 20 μM cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon). Our results were in very good accordance with conventional Nrf2 western blotting and were highly correlated with the food components' effect on the expression levels of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 and thioredoxin reductase 1, two major Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective enzymes.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of potentially toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in spices marketed in Brazil. The fungal contamination was evaluated by direct plating for samples of clove, black and white peppers. Spread plate was used for the samples of rosemary, cinnamon, fennel, pepperoni pepper and oregano. Analyses were performed in triplicate in DG18 media with incubation at 25°C for 7days. The isolation and identification of fungi followed specific recommendations of culture media and incubation period for each genus. The presence of mycotoxins in spices was verified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to fluorescence. The frequency of species potentially toxigenic was high in white and black peppers with presence of both aflatoxigenic and ochratoxigenic fungi. Only rosemary and fennel showed contamination with aflatoxin B1 and there was a positive correlation (ρ<0.01) between the rosemary contamination with the presence of AFB1 and A. flavus. Even in the presence of ochratoxigenic fungi, ochratoxin A was not detected in the samples. The presence of natural components with antimicrobial activity could justify the low presence of mycotoxins, even in the presence of known toxigenic fungi in the samples.

In this study, the effects of NaB on viability parameters and NFκB, one of the most important regulators in apoptosis, were examined in HCT116 colon cancer cells. Cell culture, light microscopy, spectrophotometry, flow cytometry, and western blot were used as methods to determine cell viability, caspase-3 activity, NFκB, Bcl-xl, Bim, and PARP proteins, respectively. NaB (6.25 mM-50 mM) treatment inhibited cell viability by inducing apoptosis, which was evident with increased Annexin V-PE staining and caspase-3 activity. NFκB activation accompanied the induction of apoptosis in NaB treated cells. Inhibition of NFκB with BAY 11-7082 did not show a pronounced effect on cell viability but induced a more apoptotic profile, which was confirmed by increased PARP fragmentation and caspase-3 activity. This effect was mostly evident at 50 mM concentration of NaB. Bcl-xl levels were not affected by NaB or BAY 11-7082/NaB treatment; whereas, total Bim increased with NaB treatment. Inhibition of NFκB activity further increased Bim levels. Overall, these results suggest that NaB induces apoptosis and activates NFκB in HCT116 colon cancer cells.

29331224,"Proanthocyanidins (PACs) find wide applications for human use including food, cosmetics, dietary supplements, and pharmaceuticals. The chemical complexity associated with PACs has triggered the development of various chromatographic techniques, with countercurrent separation (CCS) gaining in popularity. This study applied the recently developed DESIGNER (Depletion and Enrichment of Select Ingredients Generating Normalized Extract Resources) approach for the selective enrichment of trimeric and tetrameric PACs using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). This CPC method aims at developing PAC based biomaterials, particularly for their application in restoring and repairing dental hard tissue. A general separation scheme beginning with the depletion of polymeric PACs, followed by the removal of monomeric flavan-3-ols and a final enrichment step produced PAC trimer and tetramer enriched fractions. A successful application of this separation scheme is demonstrated for four polyphenol rich plant sources: grape seeds, pine bark, cinnamon bark, and cocoa seeds. Minor modifications to the generic DESIGNER CCS method were sufficient to accommodate the varying chemical complexities of the individual source materials. The step-wise enrichment of PAC trimers and tetramers was monitored using normal phase TLC and Diol-HPLC-UV analyses. CPC proved to be a reliable tool for the selective enrichment of medium size oligomeric PACs (OPACs). This method plays a key role in the development of dental biomaterials considering its reliability and reproducibility, as well as its scale-up capabilities for possible larger-scale manufacturing.",Journal of chromatography.

GC-MS analysis showed that cinnamaldehyde was the major constituent in CBEO (57.97%). The minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) of CBEO and cinnamaldehyde were 6.25 μg/mL and 2.5 μM for P. gingivalis, respectively. Nucleic acid and protein leakage was observed with increasing concentrations of CBEO and cinnamaldehyde. Additionally, propidium iodide uptake assays revealed CBEO and cinnamaldehyde at 1 × MIC impaired P. gingivalis membrane integrity by enhancing cell permeability. Morphological changes in P. gingivalis cells were observed by scanning electron microscopy, which indicated cell membrane destruction. To further determine the anti-biofilm effect, relative biofilm formation and established biofilms were examined, which demonstrated that both CBEO and cinnamaldehyde at sub-MIC levels inhibited P. gingivalis biofilm formation by 74.5% and 67.3% separately, but only CBEO slightly decreased established biofilms by 33.5% at 4 × MIC.

Presl, has been well investigated, little is known about the volatilom of its buds, which appeared recently on German markets. Soxhlet extracts of the commercial samples were prepared, fractionated using silica gel and characterised by gas chromatography-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) for semi-quantification, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for identification and by GC-FID/olfactometry for sensory evaluation. Cinnamaldehyde was the most abundant compound with concentrations up to 40 mg/g sample. In total, 36 compounds were identified and 30 were semi-quantified. The extracts contained mostly phenylpropanoids, mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated derivatives. Because of the high abundance of cinnamaldehyde, the aldehyde fraction was removed from the extracts by adding hydrogen sulphite to improve both the detection of trace compounds and column chromatography. The aldehyde fraction was analysed by GC-MS separately. The highest flavour dilution factor of 316 was calculated for cinnamaldehyde. Other main sensory contributors were 2-phenylethanol and cinnamyl alcohol. This report provides the first GC-olfactometry data of a plant part of a Cinnamomum species. The strongly lignified C. cassia buds combine a high abundance of cinnamaldehyde with comparably low coumarin concentrations (<0.48 mg/g), and provide a large cinnamaldehyde depot for slow release applications.","Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Benzyl isothiocyanate showed the highest antimicrobial activity and it was selected for developing the new active packaging material. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were successfully used to demonstrate the mode of action of benzyl isothiocyanate on Escherichia coli. Bacteria exhibited external modifications such as oval shape and the presence of septum surface, but they did not show any disruption or membrane damage. To provide data on the in vitro action of benzyl isothiocyanate and the presence of inhibition halos, the transfer mechanism to the cells was assessed using solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

27074527,"Polyphenols are partial metabolized to methylated conjugations in vivo, and then could modify bioavailability and bioactivity related to the uptake of parent compounds. Our previous studies have found that the antidiabetic effects of cinnamon barks are mainly related to polyphenol components, particularly A-type procyanidin trimer cinnamtannin-1 (CT1). It is necessary to understand the antidiabetic activity of methylations of CT1, nevertheless, sufficient amounts of methylated CT1 are difficult to obtain from metabolites in vivo. In this study, O-methyl derivatives of CT1 were prepared through one-pot methyl iodide reaction and isolation via column chromatography and RP-HPLC semipreparation. The structures of O-methyl substituents were determined through NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and HPLC-ESI-MS (High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry). Five purified O-methyl substituents and 2 isomers of CT1 were obtained. Their protective effects on a palmitic acid-induced pancreatic β-cell apoptosis model were then evaluated. Results showed that the protective effects on pancreatic β-cell of O-methyl substituents were weaker than those of CT1. The results suggested that the methylation of catechol groups could be a relevant factor contributing to the decline of protective effects on pancreatic β-cell of CT1 via obstructing quinone intermediate formation and affecting antioxidant abilities. The antidiabetic effects of O-methyl derivatives of CT1 should be further determined by other antidiabetic models.

26873449,"Cinnamon bark (Rou Gui in Chinese), cinnamon twig (Gui Zhi) and shaved cinnamon bark (Gui Sin) have been widely used as spices and in traditional Chinese medicine since ancient times. On-going issues related to quality and authenticity necessitate the development of analytical methods capable of providing an objective evaluation of samples. In this study, chemical fingerprints of cinnamon bark, cinnamon twigs and shaved cinnamon bark were established using liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA). From 125 samples of cinnamon, we identified the following eight compounds and their the detection ratios: coumarin, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde. Of these, 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde presented the largest variations in detection ratio, making up 64.0, 97.4 and 50.0% in cinnamon bark, cinnamon twig, and shaved cinnamon bark, respectively. The quantities of cinnamyl alcohol, coumarin and cinnamaldehyde also varied between the three parts of the plant. Chemical fingerprints of the three cinnamon samples were established using principal component analysis, the results of which indicate that cinnamon bark and shaved cinnamon bark could be easily differentiated, despite a marked similarity in outward appearance. Cinnamon twig was also shown to depart from the other clusters. The proposed method provides a fast and efficient means of identifying cinnamon herbs for quality control purposes.

26142866,"Bovine mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary glands of cows and causes significant economic losses in dairy cattle. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the microorganisms most commonly isolated. Novel agents are required in agricultural industries to prevent the development of mastitis. The production of biofilm by Staph. aureus facilitates the adhesion of bacteria to solid surfaces and contributes to the transmission and maintenance of these bacteria. The effect of the essential oils of Syzygium aromaticum (clove; EOSA) and Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon; EOCZ) and their major components, eugenol and cinnamaldehyde, on Staph. aureus biofilm formation on different surfaces was investigated. The results showed a significant inhibition of biofilm production by EOSA on polystyrene and stainless steel surfaces (69.4 and 63.6%, respectively). However, its major component, eugenol, was less effective on polystyrene and stainless steel (52.8 and 19.6%, respectively). Both EOCZ and its major component, cinnamaldehyde, significantly reduced biofilm formation on polystyrene (74.7 and 69.6%, respectively) and on stainless steel surfaces (45.3 and 44.9%, respectively).

Viable count of this combination showed a complete killing profile at 20 h and further confirmed its synergistic effect by reducing the bacteria cell numbers. Analysis on the stability of treated cultures for cell membrane permeability by CB when tested against sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed that the bacterial cell membrane was disrupted by the essential oils. Scanning electron microscopy observation and bacterial surface charge measurement also revealed that CB causes irreversible membrane damage and reduces the bacterial surface charge.

In this article the development of a microplate-based high-resolution α-amylase inhibition assay with direct photometric measurement of α-amylase activity is described. The inhibition assay is based on porcine pancreatic α-amylase with 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-α-D-maltotriose as substrate, which this gives a stable, sensitive, and cheap inhibition assay as requested for high-resolution purposes. In combination with HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR, this provides an analytical platform that allows simultaneous chemical and biological profiling of α-amylase inhibitors in plant extracts. Proof-of-concept with an artificial mixture of six compounds-of which three are known α-amylase inhibitors-showed that the high-resolution α-amylase inhibition profiles allowed detection of sub-microgram amounts of the α-amylase inhibitors.

Though a group of water soluble polyphenols belonging to the oligomeric procyanidins has been identified as the bioactive principle, the lack of systematic information on the effect of the polyphenol content on safety and anti-diabetic efficacy remains as a major limitation for the development of optimized and standardized cinnamon extracts for functional use. In the present paper, water soluble extracts of Cinnamomum zeylanicum containing 45 and 75% gallic acid equivalents (GAE) of polyphenol content were prepared by a novel process and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry.

The present study investigates the carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme inhibition of cinnamon PACs. Five grams of cinnamon bark powder were extracted in 100 mL acetone solution (CAE) (acetone: water: hydrochloric acid, 70:29.9:0.01) for 2 h at room temperature and in 100 mL deionized water for 30 min at 90 °C (CWE). PACs were purified from CAE using LH-20 (CAE-PAC) to be further evaluated. PAC contents were evaluated by 4-Dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMAC) assay and yielded 795, 177 and 123 mg/g, for CAE-PAC, CAE and CWE respectively. The total phenolic contents of CAE and CWE were determined to be 152 and 134 mg/g respectively. All extracts were adjusted to the same PAC content (180, 90, 45 and 20 μg) and the inhibitory activity against rat α-glucosidase was determined. The CAE-PAC fraction had very low rat α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, CAE had the highest (IC50 0.474 mg/mL total phenolic (TP) basis) followed by CWE (IC50 0.697 mg/mL TP basis). The specific maltase and sucrase inhibitory activities were determined and CAE (IC50 0.38 and 0.10 mg/mL TP basis) had higher inhibition than CWE (IC50 0.74 and 0.37 mg/mL TP basis).

This study describes the chemical profiling of natural PAC-rich extracts from 7 plants using ultra high pressure/performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) to determine the overall composition of these extracts and, in parallel, comprehensively evaluate their effect on dentin properties. The total polyphenol content of the extracts was determined (as gallic acid equivalents) using Folin-Ciocalteau assays. Dentin biomodification was assessed by the modulus of elasticity, mass change, and resistance to enzymatic biodegradation. Extracts with a high polyphenol and PAC content from Vitis vinifera, Theobroma cacao, Camellia sinensis, and Pinus massoniana induced a significant increase in modulus of elasticity and mass. The UHPLC analysis showed the presence of multiple types of polyphenols, ranging from simple phenolic acids to oligomeric PACs and highly condensed tannins. Protective effect against enzymatic degradation was observed for all experimental groups; however, statistically significant differences were observed between plant extracts. The findings provide clear evidence that the dentin bioactivities of PACs are source dependent, resulting from a combination of concentration and specific chemical constitution of the complex PAC mixtures.

23912829,"The use of the direct inlet probe-atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (DIP-APCI) ion source developed in our laboratory coupled to a high resolution Q-TOF MS for the quantitative analysis of coumarin in different cinnamon samples was demonstrated in this study. Extraction of coumarin from various cinnamon samples was followed by DIP-APCI-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS analysis. For quantification, an external calibration with and without the use of stable isotope-labeled coumarin as internal standard was compared. The results obtained by DIP-APCI-MS and LC-MS were in good agreement. Even without the use of an internal standard satisfying linearity (R(2) > 0.997), recovery (94-104% for spiking levels between 100 and 5,000 mg/kg) and intra- and interday repeatability (2.2-13.8%RSD) was demonstrated using DIP-APCI-MS. To reduce the number of samples requiring quantitative analysis, the possibility of semi-quantitative screening of coumarin directly from powdered cinnamon using DIP-APCI-MS was shown. The analysis of woodruff-flavored beverages and cinnamon-flavored chewing gum by DIP-APCI-MS resulted in the formation of an artifact interfering with coumarin detection. As with other ambient ionization methods, special attention has to be paid to possible spectral interferences due to isobaric substances present in the sample matrix or formed from matrix components after ionization. The temperature-programmed vaporization in DIP-APCI-MS combined with the use of stable isotope-labeled coumarin as internal standard helped in recognizing this interference.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D001628', 'D002853', 'D002935', 'D003374', 'D007553', 'D013058', 'D015203']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum', 'Coumarins', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Reproducibility of Results']",Quantification of coumarin in cinnamon and woodruff beverages using DIP-APCI-MS and LC-MS.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None]","['analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23912829,2014

Diluted solutions were topically applied to the thorax, which allowed for calculating LD50 and LD90 values associated with 1 d after treatment. A wide range in acute toxicity was observed across all four scarab species. Of the 24 oils tested, allyl isothiocyanate, cinnamon leaf, clove, garlic, and red thyme oils exhibited toxicity to all four species. Allyl isothiocyanate was the most toxic oil tested against the European chafer, and among the most toxic against the Japanese beetle, oriental beetle, and northern masked chafer. Red thyme was also comparatively toxic to the Japanese beetle, oriental beetle, European chafer, and northern masked chafer. Interspecific variability in susceptibility to the essential oils was documented, with 12, 11, 8, and 6 of the 24 essential oils being toxic to the oriental beetle, Japanese beetle, European chafer, and northern masked chafer, respectively.

The metabolites include ten mono-, di-, and tri- conjugated (epi)catechin phase II metabolites and more than 20 small phenolic acids from intestinal microbial fermentation. Some of these are sulfated conjugates. Feces contain intact (epi)catechin and dimers. This suggests that free radical scavenging species are in contact with the intestinal walls for hours after ingestion of cinnamon.

In addition to the advantages of MALDI-TOF as a sensitive technique for the analysis of high-molecular-weight compounds, the tandem arrangement allows the identification of the compounds through their fragmentation patterns from MS/MS experiments. This is the first time that this technique has been used to analyze polymeric PA. The results show that cinnamon PA are more complex than was previously thought. We show here for the first time that they contain (epi)gallocatechin and (epi)catechingallate units. As gallates (galloyl moieties) and the pyrogallol group in gallocatechins have been related to the biological activity of grape and tea polyphenols, the presence of these substructures may explain some of the properties of cinnamon extracts. MALDI-TOF/TOF reveals that cinnamon bark PA include combinations of (epi)catechin, (epi)catechingallate, (epi)gallocatechin, and (epi)afzelechin, which results in a highly heterogeneous mixture of procyanidins, prodelphinidins, and propelargonidins.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000872', 'D002935', 'D059808', 'D044945', 'D019032']","['Anthocyanins', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum', 'Polyphenols', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",New identification of proanthocyanidins in cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum L.) using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101466,2012

Therefore, we performed a proteomic analysis of the outer membrane and whole cell proteins from TC-treated C. sakazakii to investigate its potential antimicrobial mechanisms against C. sakazakii. The proteomic data revealed that TC exerts antimicrobial effects by several mechanisms, including disruption of carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the phytochemical analysis and the inhibitory effect of various cinnamon bark species against intestinal α-glucosidase and pancreatic α-amylase. The results showed that the content of total phenolic, flavonoid, and condensed tannin ranged from 0.17 to 0.21 g gallic acid equivalent/g extract, from 48.85 to 65.52 mg quercetin equivalent/g extract, and from 0.12 to 0.15 g catechin equivalent/g extract, respectively. The HPLC fingerprints of each cinnamon species were established. Among cinnamon species, Thai cinnamon extract was the most potent inhibitor against the intestinal maltase with the IC(50) values of 0.58 ± 0.01 mg/ml. The findings also showed that Ceylon cinnamon was the most effective intestinal sucrase and pancreatic α-amylase inhibitor with the IC(50) values of 0.42 ± 0.02 and 1.23 ± 0.02 mg/ml, respectively. In addition, cinnamon extracts produced additive inhibition against intestinal α-glucosidase and pancreatic α-amylase when combined with acarbose. These results suggest that cinnamon bark extracts may be potentially useful for the control of postprandial glucose in diabetic patients through inhibition of intestinal α-glucosidase and pancreatic α-amylase.","Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)","['D020909', 'D000818', 'D002392', 'D002851', 'D002935', 'D004338', 'D004791', 'D005419', 'D005707', 'D065089', 'D020128', 'D055292', 'D024301', 'D010936', 'D011794', 'D051381', 'D013188', 'D013393', 'D013552', 'D013634']","['Acarbose', 'Animals', 'Catechin', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Flavonoids', 'Gallic Acid', 'Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Pancreatic alpha-Amylases', 'Plant Bark', 'Plant Extracts', 'Quercetin', 'Rats', 'Sri Lanka', 'Sucrase', 'Swine', 'Tannins']",Inhibitory activity of cinnamon bark species and their combination effect with acarbose against intestinal α-glucosidase and pancreatic α-amylase.,"['Q000494', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000037', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000037', None, 'Q000032']","['pharmacology', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21538147,2011

19969552,"As a critical factor in the induction of angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has become an attractive target for anti-angiogenesis treatment. However, the side effects associated with most anti-VEGF agents limit their chronic use. Identification of naturally occurring VEGF inhibitors derived from diet is a potential alternative approach, with the advantage of known safety. To isolate natural inhibitors of VEGF, we established an in vitro tyrosine kinase assay to screen for diet-based agents that suppress VEGFR2 kinase activity. We found that a water-based extract from cinnamon (cinnamon extract, CE), one of the oldest and most popular spices, was a potent inhibitor of VEGFR2 kinase activity, directly inhibiting kinase activity of purified VEGFR2 as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase- and Stat3-mediated signaling pathway in endothelial cells. As a result, CE inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation in vitro, sprout formation from aortic ring ex vivo and tumor-induced blood vessel formation in vivo. Depletion of polyphenol from CE with polyvinylpyrrolidone abolished its anti-angiogenesis activity. While cinnamaldehyde, a component responsible for CE aroma, had little effect on VEGFR2 kinase activity, high-performance liquid chromatography-purified components of CE, procyanidin type A trimer (molecular weight, 864) and a tetramer (molecular weight, 1152) were found to inhibit kinase activity of purified VEGFR2 and VEGFR2 signaling, implicating procyanidin oligomers as active components in CE that inhibit angiogenesis.

19680836,"Some plants that are processed into foods often contain natural substances that may be hazardous to human health. One example is coumarin, which is known to cause liver and kidney damage in rats, mice and probably humans. The main source of coumarin in the diet is cinnamon. The name 'cinnamon' is correctly used to refer to Ceylon cinnamon, also known as 'true cinnamon'. However, other plant species are sometimes sold with the label of cinnamon. This is the case of Cinnamomun aromaticum (cassia). In recent years, due to its cheaper price, cassia is replacing true cinnamon in the European food market being largely used in the preparation of some kinds of sweets. Several European health agencies have recently warned against consuming high amounts of cassia due to its high content of coumarin. In this study, 34 samples of cinnamon and 50 samples of cinnamon-containing foodstuffs were collected from the Italian market. Quantitative determinations of coumarin and cinnamaldehyde were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detector (DAD).

The extract can also promote complete disassembly of recombinant tau filaments and cause substantial alteration of the morphology of paired-helical filaments isolated from AD brain. Cinnamon extract (CE) was not deleterious to the normal cellular function of tau, namely the assembly of free tubulin into microtubules. An A-linked proanthocyanidin trimer molecule was purified from the extract and shown to contain a significant proportion of the inhibitory activity. Treatment with polyvinylpyrolidone effectively depleted all proanthocyanidins from the extract solution and removed the majority, but not all, of the inhibitory activity.

The actual situation of pyrethroid pesticides in crude drugs distributed in Japan after setting MRL is not unclear and should be clarified. Although a method to analyze permethrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate in 11 crude drugs was reported, it is not adequate because the recovery rates of permethrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate from Cinnamomi cortex were very low and the method, including liquid-liquid partition is difficult. In this study, we developed a method using solid-phase extraction to analyze permethrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate in Cinnamomi cortex with acceptable recovery rates. The sample solution was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with negative chemical ionization. The recovery rates of permethrin, cypermethrin and fenvalerate from Cinnamomi cortex were between 87.9 and 90.7%. Five samples of Cinnamomi cortex were analyzed according to the proposed method.

26003373,"Coumarin is a component of natural flavourings including cassia, which is widely used in foods and pastries. The toxicity of coumarin has raised some concerns and food safety authorities have set a maximum limit of 2mg/kg for foods and beverages in general, and a maximum level of 10mg/l for alcoholic beverages. An efficient method for routine analysis of coumarin is liquid chromatography with diode array detection. The optimal sample preparation for foods containing cinnamon was investigated and found to be cold extraction of 15g sample with 50mL of methanol (80%, v/v) for 30min using magnetic stirring. In the foods under investigation, appreciable amounts of coumarin were found in bakery products and breakfast cereals (mean 9mg/kg) with the highest concentrations up to 88mg/kg in certain cookies flavoured with cinnamon. Other foods such as liqueurs, vodka, mulled wine, and milk products did not have coumarin concentrations above the maximum level. The safety assessment of coumarin containing foods, in the context of governmental food controls, is complicated as a toxicological basis for the maximum limits appears to be missing. The limits were derived at a time when a genotoxic mechanism was assumed. However, this has since been disproven in more recent studies. Our exposure data on coumarin in bakery products show that there is still a need for a continued regulation of coumarin in foods. A toxicological re-evaluation of coumarin with the aim to derive scientifically founded maximum limits should be conducted with priority.

17551716,"The aim of this work is the optimization and application of a group of analytical and microbiological techniques in the study of the activity of essential oils (EOs) incorporated in a new antimicrobial packaging material and the research in depth of the interaction between the microbial cells and the individual compounds present in the active material. For this purpose the antimicrobial activity of the active packaging containing cinnamon or oregano was evaluated against E. coli and S. aureus. The vapour phase activity and the direct contact between the antimicrobial agents themselves, or once incorporated in the packaging material, and the microbial cells have been studied. The direct contact was studied using a broth dilution method. The vapour phase was evaluated by using a new method which involves the use of a filter disk containing the EOs. Furthermore, the kill time assay was used to determine the exposure time for the maximum efficiency in packaging, and transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the antimicrobial activity and the possible mechanism of action against E. coli and S. aureus. Finally, the compounds absorbed by cells were identified. The results showed that the techniques used provide relevant information about the antibacterial activity of cinnamon and oregano in direct contact as well as in the vapour phase. The antimicrobial packaging showed a fast efficiency which supports its likely application as a food packaging material. Bacteria treated with EOs exhibit a wide range of significant abnormalities; these include formation of blebs, coagulation of cytoplasmatic constituents, collapse of the cell structure and lack of cytoplasmatic material. Some of these observations are correlated to the ability of some of these substances to disrupt envelop structure, especially the inner membrane.

17488023,"The aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. In a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (EOs)-cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and oregano (Origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis), molds (Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (Candida albicans). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were generally lower for oregano EO than for the thyme and cinnamon EOs, especially against the relatively resistant Gram-negative. The persistence of the EOs' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (PCA). More relevant chemicals were selected. In addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (S. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (A. flavus), and a yeast (C. albicans). Of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their MICs, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. To check for possible interactions between components present in the EOs, cinnamon EO was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme EO with thymol, and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified EOs using fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. Synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on A. flavus and for thymol on L. monocytogenes, S. choleraesuis, and A. flavus. In all other cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against S. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic.

The oleoresins have shown excellent activity for the inhibition of primary and secondary oxidation products in mustard oil added at the concentration of 0.02% which were evaluated using peroxide, thiobarbituric acid, p-anisidine and carbonyl values. Moreover, it was further supported by other complementary antioxidant assays such as ferric thiocyanate method in linoleic acid system, reducing power, chelating and scavenging effects on 1,1'-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radicals. In antimicrobial investigations, using inverted petriplate and food poison techniques, the leaf and bark volatile oils has been found to be highly effective against all the tested fungi except Aspergillus ochraceus. However, leaf oleoresin has shown inhibition only for Penicillium citrinum whereas bark oleoresin has caused complete mycelial zone inhibition for Aspergillus flavus and A. ochraceus along with Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, P. citrinum and Penicillium viridicatum at 6 microL. Using agar well diffusion method, leaf volatile oil and oleoresin have shown better results in comparison with bark volatile oil, oleoresin and commercial bactericide, i.e., ampicillin.

Cinnamomum verum is more popular elsewhere in the world, whereas C. cassia is a well known traditional Chinese medicine. An analysis of hydro-distilled Chinese cinnamon oil and pure cinnamaldehyde by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that cinnamaldehyde is the major component comprising 85% in the essential oil and the purity of cinnamaldehyde in use is high (> 98%). Both oil and pure cinnamaldehyde of C. cassia were equally effective in inhibiting the growth of various isolates of bacteria including Gram-positive (1 isolate, Staphylococcus aureus), and Gram-negative (7 isolates, E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Samonella typhymurium), and fungi including yeasts (four species of Candida, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. krusei), filamentous molds (4 isolates, three Aspergillus spp. and one Fusarium sp.) and dermatophytes (three isolates, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagraphytes). Their minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) as determined by agar dilution method varied only slightly. The MICs of both oil and cinnamaldehyde for bacteria ranged from 75 microg/ml to 600 microg/ml, for yeasts from 100 microg/ml to 450 microg/ml, for filamentous fungi from 75 microg/ml to 150 microg/ml, and for dermatophytes from 18.8 microg/ml to 37.5 microg/ml.

The results showed that cross-validation models are able to predict accurately almost all of the components of essential oils. In different cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and clove (Syzygium aromaticum) essential oils, which showed a similar composition, 23 components (representing 97.8-99.9% of the oil) were accurately predicted, as well as 20 components (93.0-99.1%) in Cinnamomum camphora (ravintsara), 32 components (92.3-98.1%) in Ravensara aromatica (ravensara), and 26 components (96.6-98.4%) in Lippia multiflora. For almost all of the components, the modelled and reference values obtained by GC-FID were highly correlated (r2 > or = 0.985) and exhibited a low variance (less than 5%). The model was also able to discriminate between the ravintsara and ravensara essential oils. It was shown that two commercial oils labelled as R. aromatica were actually ravintsara (C. camphora), revealing the misidentification of these essential oils in the marketplace.

16508136,"It is desirable to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the early stages during its development since its treatment is usually difficult. We previously proposed a new diagnostic method that made use of the total metallothionein (MT), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) concentrations in the liver of the HCC patients. We recently found that MT-1 is involved in the metabolism or detoxification of toxic metals, such as cadmium; on the other hand, MT-2 is responsible for the homeostasis of essential metals such as copper, in experimental models such as Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats. In order to device a better diagnostic method than the one we proposed previously, in this study, we newly propose an improved method that includes the discriminative determination data regarding the MT isomers, namely, MT-1 and MT-2, in the liver of patients with or without HCC as compared with the total MT level. The total MT and Zn concentrations in the HCC patients were confirmed to be significantly lower than those in patients without hepatic disorders (Ctrl). In contrast, Cu concentrations of the HCC patients were higher than those of the Ctrl patients. In addition, in the juxta-tumor portion with HCC, MT-1 concentrations were significantly higher than those of MT-2. In contrast, the MT-1 concentrations in the tumor portion were significantly lower than that in the juxta-tumor portion. In addition, MT-1/MT-2 ratio in the tumor portion was significantly lower than that of the juxta-tumor portion. By using parameters such as concentrations of Cu, Zn, total MT, and MT isomers, we performed the multivariate discriminative analysis (MDA).

In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) << MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase. The atmosphere generated from the EOs was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Differences among the volatiles in the EOs, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D028524', 'D000900', 'D001231', 'D002176', 'D055598', 'D002627', 'D002935', 'D005516', 'D005659', 'D020939', 'D006090', 'D006094', 'D018649', 'D009822', 'D010407', 'D027542', 'D027842']","['Anethum graveolens', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'Candida albicans', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Ginger', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Ocimum basilicum', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Penicillium', 'Rosmarinus', 'Syzygium']",Solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16104824,2005

We have shown that extracts from cinnamon enhance the activity of insulin. The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize insulin-enhancing complexes from cinnamon that may be involved in the alleviation or possible prevention and control of glucose intolerance and diabetes. Water-soluble polyphenol polymers from cinnamon that increase insulin-dependent in vitro glucose metabolism roughly 20-fold and display antioxidant activity were isolated and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. The polymers were composed of monomeric units with a molecular mass of 288. Two trimers with a molecular mass of 864 and a tetramer with a mass of 1152 were isolated. Their protonated molecular masses indicated that they are A type doubly linked procyanidin oligomers of the catechins and/or epicatechins.

11700345,"Muscodor albus is a recently described endophytic fungus obtained from small limbs of Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon tree). This xylariaceaous fungus effectively inhibits and kills certain other fungi, and bacteria, by virtue of a mixture of volatile compounds that it produces. The majority of these compounds were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and then made into an artificial mixture that mimicked the antibiotic effects of the mixture of volatile compounds given off by the fungus. Each of the five classes of volatile compounds produced by the fungus (alcohols, esters, ketones, acids and lipids) had some inhibitory effect against the test fungi and bacteria, but none was lethal. However, collectively they acted synergistically to kill a broad range of plant- and human-pathogenic fungi and bacteria. The most effective class of inhibitory compounds was the esters, of which 1-butanol, 3-methyl-, acetate was the most active biologically.

11087542,"trans-Cinnamaldehyde, the principal component of cinnamon flavor, is a potent antimicrobial compound present in essential oils such as cinnamon. In the course of studies designed to discover its maximum microbial lethality under food-processing conditions, a gas chromatographic-mass spectrophotometric procedure was developed for the extraction and analysis of essential oil components such as cinnamaldehyde from commercial cinnamon-containing foods (several brands of cinnamon breads, cereals, cookies, puddings, applesauces, and fruit juices). The cinnamaldehyde content ranged from trace amounts in orange juice to 12.2 mg/100 g (122 ppm) in apple cinnamon cereals and 31.1 mg/100 g (311 ppm) for cinnamon swirl bread (highest value). To ascertain the heat stability of cinnamaldehyde, pure cinnamaldehyde, pure eugenol, cinnamon oil, and mixtures consisting of cinnamaldehyde plus eugenol or cinnamon oil were heated at graded temperatures up to 210 degrees C and 60 min, and then possible compositional changes were examined. Eugenol was stable to heat, as were the components of cinnamon oil: carvone, eugenol, and linalool. In contrast, starting at approximately 60 degrees C, pure cinnamaldehyde undergoes a temperature-dependent transformation to benzaldehyde under the influence of heat. Eugenol, both pure and in cinnamon oil, when added to pure cinnamaldehyde protected the aldehyde against heat destruction. The protection may due to an antioxidative action of eugenol.

The method developed here is a modification of an earlier methodology which used a radioactive Cd isotope ((109)Cd). While retaining the many advantages of this previous approach, the procedure presented here uses stable isotope ratio measurements ((114)Cd/(111)Cd) for the determination of MT. Experimental parameters governing the instrumental precision and accuracy for isotope ratio measurements of Cd by ICP-MS were characterized. Systematic errors, including mass bias, detector dead time, and spectroscopic interferences, could be easily corrected. The isotope dilution ICP-MS method was validated by the determination of very low levels of cadmium in biological certified reference materials (NIST SRM 2670 freeze-dried urine, IAEA H-8 horse kidney, and BCR TP-25 lichens). Finally, the IDA procedure was evaluated for the determination of oxidized MT by a Cd-saturation method previously developed using radioactive (109)Cd.

8473340,"Although ceruloplasmin is known to be a copper-transporting protein, little is known about the biochemical mechanisms of copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin during the biosynthesis. We have examined various levels of ceruloplasmin biosynthesis in the Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat, which possesses a mutation causing the deficiency in serum ceruloplasmin activity associated with excess hepatic copper accumulation. Southern and Northern blot analyses revealed that the gene and mRNA encoding ceruloplasmin resided normally in LEC rat liver. Western blot analysis showed a normal level of ceruloplasmin in LEC rat serum. Following metabolic labeling of hepatocytes with 64Cu, no radioactive copper was detected in the ceruloplasmin fraction in LEC rat hepatocytes using Sephadex G-75 column chromatography, indicating that copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin is deficient in the LEC rat. Furthermore, LEC rat hepatocytes incubated with 64Cu also showed a reduction in the efficiency of copper transport from cytosolic to noncytosolic fractions and a reduced copper efflux from the hepatocytes, indicating that LEC rat hepatocytes possess an abnormality in copper metabolism. These results suggest that an abnormality of the copper delivery mechanism causes an inhibition of copper incorporation into the ceruloplasmin molecule in the liver, leading to the deficiency in serum ceruloplasmin activity in the LEC rat. In addition, this abnormality also seems to cause an inhibition of biliary copper excretion. The blocking of these two copper exclusion pathways is thought to lead to excess hepatic copper accumulation in the LEC rat.
