33984445,"Clubroot disease, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae infection, occurs in cruciferous vegetable crops in many areas of the world, sometimes leading to yield loss. In this study, a differentially expressed protein (0305), was found between control and clubroot-diseased Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L.) roots through two-dimensional electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that Bra003466 was highly matched to protein 0305. Because the sequence of Bra003466 had 89% percent identity with ATG6 of Arabidopsis thaliana and other Brassica, the gene was named as BrATG6. However, 790 bp sequences were mismatched with the cDNA sequence of the Bra003466 gene from the Brassica database. In this study, we cloned the cDNA of Bra003466 and found the BrATG6 was highly expressed in roots among all organs. When plants were inoculated with P. brassicae Woronin, the expression of BrATG6 was significantly increased in infected roots of Chinese cabbage. This result was verified by reverse transcription-qPCR and in situ hybridization. Examination of disease resistance showed that, compared with wild type plants, A. thaliana ATG6 deletion mutants were more easily infected by P. brassicae than WT. This shows that BrATG6 may play a potential role in the resistance of B. rapa to P. brassicae infection.",Gene,"['D000595', 'D017360', 'D000071186', 'D001937', 'D029741', 'D060467', 'D017343', 'D010935', 'D018517', 'D056909', 'D011528']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Beclin-1', 'Brassica', 'Brassica rapa', 'Disease Resistance', 'Genes, Plant', 'Plant Diseases', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodiophorida', 'Protozoan Infections']",Discovery of BrATG6 and its potential role in Brassica rapa L. resistance to infection by Plasmodiophora brassicae.,"['Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235']","['genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984445,2021

29655730,"This study revealed the compositional characteristics of sunki, a traditional, unsalted, lactic acid-fermented pickle produced using turnip leaf in Kiso district, Japan. Comprehensive compositional analysis by two metabolomic approaches based on NMR and solid-phase microextraction-GC/MS methods was used to determine its chemical composition by annotating 54 water-soluble and 62 volatile compounds. Principal component analysis showed that samples had different compositions, depending on the agricultural processing factory and production year. This variation potentially resulted from the differences in the lactic acid bacterial community produced during the spontaneous fermentation of sunki and in the initial nutritional composition of the turnip leaf. Partial least squares regression revealed that the acetic acid level showed a strong positive correlation with pH (R = 0.810), in contrast to the negative correlations of lactic acid and ethanol levels (R =  -0.533 and -0.547).

This study aimed to detect possible changes in Se-metabolism after Se-DRS consumption and to assess its suitability as a Se supplement in monogaster feed. In this experiment, rats were fed three types of diets differing in Se-form: soybean meal, Se-salt and Se-DRS. Potential differences in Se-metabolism were evaluated based on the total Se concentrations along with non-protein Se speciation patterns in the urine and blood serum of the rats. The total Se concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Se compounds in the samples were identified through high-performance liquid chromatography/ICP-MS. The total Se excretion rate was dose-dependent, and excess of dietary Se was eliminated in the form of Se-sugar 1, regardless of the administered Se-form. The excretion dynamics of dietary selenomethionine (soybean meal) and methylselenocysteine (Se-DRS) were different to that of the mineral Se (Se-salt). The proportions of Se species in the urine were significantly influenced by the Se source. A specific metabolic pathway, resulting in urinary excretion of Se-sugar 2, was observed in animals fed Se-DRS. Neither the total Se concentrations nor the serum Se speciation patterns differed between the animals fed the conventional diet and those fed the Se-DRS-enriched diet.

29067611,"A sensitive and selective method was developed and validated for the determination of pyrethrin residues in turnips (turnip leaves, turnip tubers, and the whole of plant) and cultivated soil using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Six major components of pyrethrins (pyrethrin I and II, cinerin I and II, and jasmolin I and II) were separated and identified. The method involving solid-phase extraction (SPE) cleanup led to satisfactory average recoveries (88.1-104%) with limits of quantification (LOQs) of 0.05 mg/kg. The dissipation and final residue of pyrethrins in six provinces (among these places, two experiments were conducted in greenhouse and other four experiments in open filed) in China were studied. The trial results suggested that the half-lives of pyrethrins in the whole of turnips and soil were 0.5-1.6 and 1.0-1.3 days, respectively, and the degradation of pyrethrins in the greenhouse was quicker than that in open fields. The final residues of pyrethrins in turnip leaves and tubers were all below the maximum residue limit (MRL) established by the EU (1.0 mg/kg). A pre-harvest interval of 2 days and MRL of 1.0 mg/kg are recommended to ensure food safety standards for pyrethrins in turnips.

Because some species of this family are common crops utilised as food for direct consumption or raw materials for food production, thallium can enter the food chain. A useful method for thallium determination is inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The limit of detection (0.2 pg ml(-1) Tl or 0.02 ng g(-1) Tl, taking in the account dilution during sample decomposition) found in the current study was very low, and the method can be used for ultra-trace analysis. Possible transfer of thallium from rape seed to the rape oil was investigated in two ways. The balance of thallium in rape seed meal (content 140-200 ng g(-1) Tl) and defatted rape seed meal indicated that thallium did not pass into the oil (p < 0.05).

25966400,"We have developed a label-free fluorescence sensor for caffeic acid (CA) by the use of CdTe:Zn(2+) quantum dots (CdTe:Zn(2+) QDs) as an output signal. The principle of sensor is based on the fluorescence quenching and binding properties of Fe(2+) toward QDs and CA, respectively. To provide a fluorescence turn-on mode for CA detection, Fe(2+) is first mixed with QDs solution, leading to a low fluorescence emission. With the addition of CA, the fluorescence of QDs is recovered due to the strong binding interaction between CA and Fe(2+). Thus, a QDs-based label-free fluorescence sensor, designed in a simple mix-and-detect format, is established for CA detection. This study demonstrated here not only offers simple, sensitive and non-enzymatic detection method for CA, but also brings to light a new application of QDs in the food analysis.

Ti distribution in root cross sections depended on NP agglomeration state. NP are also accumulated in plantlets upon leaf exposure. Finally, it was found that TiO₂-NP exposure induced increased root elongation but did not affect germination, evapotranspiration, and plant biomass.

The formation of canolol during roasting was compared among HEM varieties (Brassica juncea, B. juncea var. oriental, Brassica nigra, and Sinapis alba) together with a low erucic rapeseed variety. HEM varieties were shown to produce less than one-third of canolol compared to rapeseed at similar roasting conditions. This observation was linked to a lower free sinapic acid content together with a lower loss of sinapic acid derivatives in the HEM varieties compared to rapeseed.

Brassicaceae plants contain a large variety of interesting secondary metabolites, including glucosinolates, hydroxycinnamic acids, and flavonoids. These metabolites are also of particular importance due to their proposed positive effects on human health. Next to these well-known groups of phytochemicals, many more metabolites are of course also present in crude extracts prepared from Brassica and Arabidopsis plant material.High-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), especially if combined with a high mass resolution instrument such as a QTOF MS, is a powerful approach to separate, detect, and annotate metabolites present in crude aqueous-alcohol plant extracts. Using an essentially unbiased procedure that takes into account all metabolite mass signals from the raw data files, detailed information on the relative abundance of hundreds of both known and, as yet, unknown semipolar metabolites can be obtained. These comprehensive metabolomics data can then be used to, for instance, identify genetic markers regulating metabolic composition, determine effects of (a)biotic stress or specific growth conditions, or establish metabolite changes occurring upon food processing or storage.This chapter describes in detail a procedure for preparing crude extracts and performing comprehensive HPLC-QTOF MS-based profiling of semi-polar metabolites in Brassicaceae plant material. Compounds present in the extract can be (partially or completely) annotated based on their accurate mass, their MS/MS fragments and on other specific chemical characteristics such as retention time and UV-absorbance spectrum.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","['D017360', 'D019607', 'D002851', 'D003373', 'D005419', 'D005961', 'D055442', 'D055432']","['Arabidopsis', 'Brassicaceae', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Flavonoids', 'Glucosinolates', 'Metabolome', 'Metabolomics']",High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of plant metabolites in brassicaceae.,"['Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","['metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22351174,2012
20706951,"A significant source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in human diet is vegetable oils, especially those produced from plants grown in regions where the soil and the atmosphere are contaminated with these chemicals. Contamination with PAH of vegetable oils may also occur in the process of plant material drying with smoke or exhaust fumes, or in the course of extraction of that material with solvents containing trace amounts of PAH. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the levels of PAH present in rape seeds and the occurrence of these compounds in cultivation region and the relationship of the levels of PAH in rape seeds to thermal treatment after harvest. Rape seeds and pods from experimental fields and rape seeds subjected to thermal treatment in dryers obtained from suppliers of the raw material were examined and compared. Cleanup of extracts was performed with high-resolution size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and final determinations were by Trace Ultra/PolarisQ gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The results obtained indicated that during thermal treatment of rape seeds the concentration of PAH increased, but the levels of benzo[a]pyrene did not exceed threshold permissible levels.

Mei Qing Choi), also called bok choy, at 3 stages of growth (2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 wk). Sensory and instrumental data were correlated using partial least squares regression. Pac choi was grown in late spring. Descriptive sensory analysis was conducted by a highly trained panel and compounds were identified and quantified using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer. The findings of the study indicate that the differences in sensory characteristics and chemical profiles among stages of growth are more substantial than the differences between organic and conventional production. Green-unripe, musty/earthy, lettuce, and sweet flavors are representative in pac choi at early stages of growth. When older, pac choi has higher intensities of green-grassy/leafy, bitter, cabbage, and sulfur flavors that are associated with the increase of (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, octyl acetate, 1-nonanol, 2-decanone, 1-penten-3-ol, linalool, camphor, menthol, isobornyl acetate, geranylacetone, and cedrol compounds.

HAs are mutagenic/carcinogenic compounds formed at low levels via the Maillard reaction and a free radical mechanism during cooking of animal tissue. The addition of pure antioxidants or foods containing antioxidants has previously been shown to decrease the amount of HAs formed during cooking. In this study, beefburgers were fried in six different oils: refined olive oil, virgin olive oil, virgin olive oil depleted of phenols, rapeseed oil, virgin olive oil with rosemary extract and refined olive oil with rosemary extract. The content of antioxidative compounds in the virgin olive oil and the rosemary extract was determined. The beefburgers were analysed with regards to 12 different HAs by solid phase extraction and HPLC analysis. MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, PhIP, Harman and Norharman were detected in all beefburgers fried in the different oils, but the relative amounts varied. Frying in virgin olive oil reduced the formation of HAs compared with refined olive oil. This effect is probably due to the content of phenols in the virgin olive oil.

10899606,"The nuclear inclusion protein a (NIa) of turnip mosaic potyvirus is a protease responsible for processing the viral polyprotein into functional proteins. The NIa protease exhibits an unusual optimum proteolytic activity at about 16 degrees C. In order to understand the origin of the low-temperature optimum activity, the effects of temperature and salt ions on the catalytic activity and the structure of the NIa protease have been investigated. The analysis of the temperature dependence of k(cat) and K(m) revealed that K(m) decreases more drastically than k(cat) as temperature decreases. The thermodynamic analysis showed that the decrease of K(m) is driven entropically, suggesting a possibility that the substrate binding might need a large entropy cost. The secondary structure of the NIa protease was significantly perturbed at temperatures between 20 and 40 degrees C and the protease was unfolded at very low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride with a transition midpoint of 0.8 M. These results suggest that the NIa protease is highly flexible in structure. Interestingly, salt ions including NaCl, KCl, CaCl(2) and MgCl(2) stimulated the proteolytic activity by 2-6-fold and increased the optimum temperature to 20-25 degrees C. This stimulatory effect of the salt ions was due to the lowering of K(m). The salt ions promoted the structural rigidity as evidenced in the higher resistance to the heat-induced unfolding in the presence of the salt ions. The increase in rigidity may lead to the lowering of K(m) possibly by reducing the entropic cost for substrate binding. Taken together, these results suggest that the NIa protease is highly flexible in structure and the low-temperature optimum activity might possibly be attributed to lowered entropy cost for substrate binding at lower temperatures.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,"['D002384', 'D002942', 'D010450', 'D004795', 'D006868', 'D009687', 'D017800', 'D012492', 'D013050', 'D013696', 'D014764', 'D014779']","['Catalysis', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Endopeptidases', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Hydrolysis', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Potyvirus', 'Salts', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Temperature', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus Replication']",Temperature and salt effects on proteolytic function of turnip mosaic potyvirus nuclear inclusion protein a exhibiting a low-temperature optimum activity.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000201', 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'enzymology', 'pharmacology', None, None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10899606,2000
