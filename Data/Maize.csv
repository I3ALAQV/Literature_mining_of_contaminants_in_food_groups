35325205,"Nucleus-encoded circular RNAs (ncircRNAs) have been widely detected in eukaryotes, and most circRNA identification algorithms are designed to identify them. However, using these algorithms, few mitochondrion-encoded circRNAs (mcircRNAs) have been identified in plants, and the role of plant mcircRNAs has not yet been addressed. Here, we developed a circRNA identification algorithm, mitochondrion-encoded circRNA identifier (MeCi), based on common features of plant mitochondrial genomes. We identified 7,524, 9,819, 1,699, 1,821, 1,809, and 5,133 mcircRNAs in maize (Zea mays), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), and grape (Vitis vinifera), respectively. These mcircRNAs were experimentally validated. Plant mcircRNAs had distinct characteristics from ncircRNAs, and they were more likely to be derived from RNA degradation but not intron backsplicing. Alternative circularization was prevalent in plant mitochondria, and most parental genomic regions hosted multiple mcircRNA isoforms, which have homogenous 5' termini but heterogeneous 3' ends. By analysis of mitopolysome and mitoribosome profiling data, 1,463 mcircRNAs bound to ribosomes were detected in maize and Arabidopsis. Further analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data identified 358 mcircRNA-derived polypeptides. Overall, we developed a computational pipeline that efficiently identifies plant mcircRNAs, and we demonstrated mcircRNAs are widespread and translated in plants.",Plant physiology,[],[],Mitochondrion-encoded circular RNAs are widespread and translatable in plants.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35325205,2022

The aims of this study were to evaluate the contents on nine metallic trace elements (Fe, Zn, Mn, Co, Cd, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr) in some major raw foodstuffs including rice, maize, peanut, tomato and dried fish in Burkina Faso and assess the health risk of these elements. Two hundred twenty-two samples were collected and analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. The health risk assessment was based on the United States Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) model. Iron and Zinc were the elements with the highest concentrations in the investigated foodstuffs. The iron highest median value (68.80 mg/kg) was observed in dried fish followed by maize (43.09 mg/kg) and peanuts (28.92 mg/kg). Rates of 77.95%, 66.66% and 32.5% obtained respectively fro tomato, maize and rice samples were above the maximum limit of lead set by Codex Alimentarius while 47.6%, 71.16% and 0% of maize, tomato and rice samples respectively have shown concentration above the maximum limit of cadmium. Chromium had shown higher contribution rate to the maximum daily intake of 167.11%, 34%, 2% and 8.53% for rice, maize and peanut respectively.

35202122,"An immunoaffinity magnetic beads (IMBs) based automatic pretreatment method was developed for the quantitative analysis of deoxynivalenol (DON) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet detector (UPLC-UV). First, N-hydroxysuccinimide-terminated magnetic beads (NHS-MBs) with good magnetic responsivity and dispersibility were synthesized and characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and laser diffraction-based particle size analyzer. Then, the amino groups of anti-DON monoclonal antibody (mAb) and the NHS groups of NHS-MBs were linked by covalent bonds to prepare IMB, without any activation reagent. The essential factors affecting the binding and elution of DON were meticulously tuned. Under optimal conditions, DON could be extracted from a real sample and eluted from IMB by water, enabling environmentally friendly and green analysis. Hence, there was no need for dilution or evaporation prior to UPLC-UV analysis. DON in 20 samples could be purified and concentrated within 30 min by the mycotoxin automated purification instrument (MAPI), allowing for automated, green, high-throughput and simple clean-up. Recoveries at four distinct spiking levels in corn and wheat ranged from 92.0% to 109.5% with good relative standard deviations (RSD, 2.1-7.0%). Comparing the test results of IAC and IMB in commercial samples demonstrated the reliability and superiority of IMB for quantitatively analyzing massive samples.",Toxins,"['D000911', 'D002851', 'D052203', 'D005506', 'D060328', 'D013388', 'D014255', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ferrosoferric Oxide', 'Food Contamination', 'Magnetic Phenomena', 'Succinimides', 'Trichothecenes', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",An Automatic Immunoaffinity Pretreatment of Deoxynivalenol Coupled with UPLC-UV Analysis.,"['Q000276', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['immunology', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35202122,2022
35169269,"Novel Immunological and Mass Spectrometry Methods for Comprehensive Analysis of Recalcitrant Oligosaccharides in AFEX Pretreated Corn Stover. Lignocellulosic biomass is a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel and is extensively used for developing bio-based technologies to produce products such as food, feed, fuel, and chemicals. The key to these technologies is to develop cost competitive processes to convert complex carbohydrates present in plant cell wall to simple sugars such as glucose, xylose, and arabinose. Since lignocellulosic biomass is highly recalcitrant, it must undergo a combination of thermochemical treatment such as Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX), dilute acid (DA), Ionic Liquid (IL) and biological treatment such as enzyme hydrolysis and microbial fermentation to produce desired products. However, when using commercial fungal enzymes during hydrolysis, only 75-85% of the soluble sugars generated are monomeric sugars, while the remaining 15-25% are soluble recalcitrant oligosaccharides that cannot be easily utilized by microorganisms. Previously, we successfully separated and purified the soluble recalcitrant oligosaccharides using a combination of charcoal and celite-based separation followed by size exclusion chromatography and studies their inhibitory properties on enzymes. We discovered that the oligosaccharides with higher degree of polymerization (DP) containing methylated uronic acid substitutions were more recalcitrant towards commercial enzyme mixtures than lower DP and neutral oligosaccharides. Here, we report the use of several complementary techniques that include glycome profiling using plant biomass glycan specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to characterize sugar linkages in plant cell walls and enzymatic hydrolysate, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) using structurally-informative diagnostic peaks offered by negative ion post-secondary decay spectra, gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to characterize oligosaccharide sugar linkages with and without derivatization. Since oligosaccharides (DP 4-20) are small, it is challenging to mobilize these molecules for mAbs binding and characterization. To overcome this problem, we have applied a new biotin-coupling based oligosaccharide immobilization method that successfully tagged most of the low DP soluble oligosaccharides on to a micro-plate surface followed by specific linkage analysis using mAbs in a high-throughput system. This new approach will help develop more advanced versions of future high throughput glycome profiling methods that can be used to separate and characterize oligosaccharides present in biomarkers for diagnostic applications.",Scientific reports,"['D000911', 'D018533', 'D001710', 'D002236', 'D002473', 'D002850', 'D004797', 'D000939', 'D008401', 'D006868', 'D008031', 'D009844', 'D010936', 'D018515', 'D019032', 'D000073893', 'D003313']","['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biomass', 'Biotin', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cell Wall', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrolysis', 'Lignin', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Leaves', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Sugars', 'Zea mays']",Understanding the structure and composition of recalcitrant oligosaccharides in hydrolysate using high-throughput biotin-based glycome profiling and mass spectrometry.,"['Q000276', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000276', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['immunology', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'methods', 'immunology', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35169269,2022
35124380,"Maize and grass silages are important dietary components for ruminant livestock that influence the quality of animal products for human consumption, such as milk, in many parts of the world. Infection of plants by fungi able to produce mycotoxins, either in the field or post-harvest, can result in a decrease of silage nutritional quality and, consequently, in milk quality. In this study, 45 maize and grass silage samples were collected from 25 dairy farms located in the north of Portugal. The occurrence of fungi was evaluated in samples, the most frequently isolated species being Aspergillus fumigatus, Dipodascus geotrichum, Mucor circinelloides, Penicillium paneum, and Aspergillus flavus. The mycotoxigenic profile of the fungal species was studied using the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry-ion trap-time-of-flight (UHPLC-MS-IT-TOF) detection. In addition, a new method based on a QuEChERS extraction followed by the UHPLC- tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) detection was developed for simultaneous analysis of 39 mycotoxins in silage. A high co-occurrence of Fusarium mycotoxins was found, although at low levels of contamination. Deoxynivalenol and beauvericin were found in more than 82% of maize silage samples.

34944482,"Zein is a type of prolamin storage protein that has a variety of biomedical and industrial applications. Due to the considerable genetic variability and polyploidity of the starting material, as well as the extraction methods used, the characterization of the protein composition of zein requires a combination of different analytical processes. Therefore, we combined modern analytical methods such as mass spectrometry (MS), Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), atomic force microscopy (AFM), or Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) for a better characterization of the extracted zein. In this study, we present an enhanced eco-friendly extraction method, including grinding and sieving corn seeds, for prolamins proteins using an ultrasonic extraction methodology. The use of an ultrasonic homogenizer, 65% ethanol extraction buffer, and 710 µm maize granulation yielded the highest protein extraction from all experimental conditions we employed. An SDS PAGE analysis of the extracted zein protein mainly revealed two intense bands of approximatively 20 and 23 kDa, suggesting that the extracted zein was mostly α-zein monomer. Additionally, MS analysis revealed as a main component the α-zein PMS2 (Uniprot accession no. P24450) type protein in the maize flour extract. Moreover, AFM studies show that extracting zein with a 65% ethanol and a 710 µm granulation yields a homogeneous content that could allow these proteins to be employed in future medical applications.

34600685,"Food authenticity relies on genuineness and reliability according to the information displayed on the package. Since the 18th century, when coffee became popularized in the West, adulteration began. Several methods have been developed to detect different kinds of frauds and they have evolved as demands increased and new technologies were introduced. The evolution of the science of coffee authenticity control in the past three centuries is reviewed, focusing on the discrimination between coffee and other foods or between coffee and its by-products. The earliest chemical and physical methods are presented followed by methods developed in the 20th and 21st centuries using microscopy, chromatography and spectroscopy associated with advanced statistical tools, and DNA-based methods. In addition to non-food material, before the 20th century, chicory was the most studied food-adulterant. From the 20th century on, corn, coffee by-products, and barley were the most studied, followed by chicory, rice and other food items. Matrix effects seem to be among the most challenging problems in these approaches, associated with variations in roast degree, particle size (particularly in spectroscopy-based methods), and lack of control over reference samples regarding species and purity. Limits of detection vary considerably within each category, with most limits being too high for commercial use. DNA-based methods appear to be promising to assess coffee authenticity, given that the limits of detection and quantification are low, and specificity is higher than in other methods. Nevertheless, as roast intensity increases, the sensitivity of the method decreases. So far, most reported methods have not been validated and only a few have been tested on commercial brands, except for those involving microscopy which has been highly used for monitoring coffee authenticity although not always efficiently enough.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D003069', 'D005506', 'D005607', 'D015203', 'D003313']","['Coffee', 'Food Contamination', 'Fraud', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Zea mays']",Three centuries on the science of coffee authenticity control.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600685,2021

While a large amount is known about their occurrence in crops, food, and feeds, little is known about mycotoxin amounts in soil. However, soil is known as a major fungal habitat and a potential sink for mycotoxins in the environment. Furthermore, there is neither a reliable detection nor an extraction method for mycotoxins testing in different soil textures or for potential deficits due to aging processes. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to present a reliable extraction and detection method for the simultaneous quantification of the most common mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA), via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This method was validated with six different samples with different textures and different soil organic matter (SOM). Deuterated standards were used to overcome possible matrix effects.

34236211,"The cosmopolitan species Fusarium graminearum Schwabe directly reduces yield, as well as grain quality of cereals, due to its ability to synthesize mycotoxins. Previously it was considered to be one species occurring on all continents. However, phylogenetic analysis employing the GCPSR method (Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition) revealed the existence of 15 phylogenetic species within what is now recognised as the Fusarium graminearum Species Complex (FGSC) (Sarver et al. 2011). During 1996-2008, a MRIZP collection of FGSC isolates was established and isolates originating from wheat (5), maize (3) and barely (2) were selected for further study. Morphological features including the appearance of colonies and macroconidia (average size 38.5-53.1 × 4.6-5.4 µm, No 50) of all 10 isolates on PDA were consistent with descriptions of F. graminearum (O'Donnell et al. 2004, Leslie and Summerell 2006). Total DNA was isolated from mycelium removed from 7-day old colonies of single-spore isolates grown on PDA using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden). Further identification was based on amplification and sequencing of elongation factor TEF-1α, histone H3 and β-tubulin in both directions, with primers ef1/ef2, H3-1a/H3-1b and T1/T22, respectively (Jacobs et al. 2010). The sequences were deposited in NCBI under accession numbers MF974399 - MF974408 (TEF-1α), MG063783 - MG063792 (β-tubulin) and MF999139 - MF999148 (histone H3). Sequence analysis was performed using BLAST while genetic similarity was calculated using MEGA 6.0 software. Isolate 1339 originating from wheat (collected at the locality of Kikinda in 2006), shared 100% nucleotide identity with TEF-1α (DQ459745), histone H3 (DQ459728) and β-tubulin (DQ459643) of F. vorosii isolate NRRL37605 (Starkey et al. 2007). The remaining nine isolates were identified as F. graminearum as they shared 99% to 100% nucleotide similarity with F. graminearum NRRL 28439 (O'Donnell et al. 2004). Pathogenicity was tested using artificial inoculations of spikes during wheat flowering (Mesterhazy et al. 1999). Thirty classes were inoculated with each isolate, in three replicates. Inoculum was prepared from 7-day colonies on PDA, and 30 ml of a conidia suspension (1x105 conidia/ml) was used. Control plants were inoculated with sterile water. Three weeks after inoculation, typical Fusarium head blight symptoms were visible on inoculated plants, from which all 10 isolates were successfully reisolated. Control spikes remained symptomless. Disease severity was estimated on the 1-7 scale (Blandino et al. 2012). Average pathogenicity of the F. vorosii isolate 1339 was 1.9, and 2.4 -5.1 of F. graminearum isolates. Toxin production was determined using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Kernels inoculated with the 10 isolates were ground and tested for the presence of deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetyl derivatives 3ADON, 15ADON and NIV. F. vorosii isolate 1339 possessed the 15ADON chemotype, as well as eight F. graminearum isolates, while only one F. graminearum isolate was 3ADON chemotype. To date, F. vorosii has only been detected in Hungary on wheat (Toth et al. 2005) and Korea on barley, corn and rice (Lee et al. 2016). This is the first report of F. vorosii in Serbia, which is of great importance, because it indicates the spread of this toxigenic species.

The ratios of hidden to total ZEN in zein are decreased from 54.25% to 40.74% after thermal treatment and from 54.25% to 0 after alkaline treatment, respectively. Conversely, acid treatment increased the ratio of hidden to total ZEN from 54.25% to 100%.

Unlike maize-based ogi, little is known about the bacterial community and mycotoxin profile during the production of millet-based ogi. Therefore, the bacterial community dynamics and mycotoxin reduction during ogi processing from three millet varieties were investigated using next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. A total of 1163 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were obtained, with ASV diversity across time intervals influenced by processing stage and millet variety. ASV distribution among samples suggested that the souring stage was more influenced by millet variety than the steeping stage, and that souring may be crucial for the quality attributes of the ogi. Furthermore, bacterial community structure during steeping and souring was significantly differentiated (PERMANOVA, P < 0.05) between varieties, with close associations observed for closely-related millet varieties. Taxonomically, Firmicutes, followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla were relatively abundant (>1%). Lactic acid bacteria, such as Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus and Pediococcus, dominated most fermentation stages, suggesting their roles as key fermentative and functional bacteria in relation to mycotoxin reduction.

33766687,"As a valuable food base and safe shelter, large agricultural fields create favourable living conditions for wild boars for most of the year. The occurrence of mould in these fields, causing hormonal disturbances, may lead to a lower age of sexual maturity and a prolonged breeding season, and therefore, the population growth in farmlands can be markedly higher than that in extensive woodlands. This study was initiated because of reproductive cycle disturbances in wild boar populations, which were presumably linked with habitat and food types, especially rotten maize. To determine if the major sources of zearalenone (ZEN) in female wild boars are maize cobs infected with mycotoxins, we compared the concentrations of ZEN and its metabolites in organs, tissues and body fluids of wild boars hunted in extensive maize fields and in extensive woodlands where no large maize fields were located within a distance of several km. Samples of blood, bile, liver, kidneys, muscles, urine, stomach and colon contents as well as ovaries from young female wild boars (40-60 kg) were collected in 2011-2014 and prepared for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The results showed that ZEN was present in most of the samples, from both farmlands and woodlands, but its concentration within individual types of the analysed body fluids or tissues differed depending mainly on habitat type. In nearly all the analysed cases, higher concentrations of ZEN and its derivatives were detected in the samples collected from wild boars in farmlands, suggesting that wild boars living and feeding in extensive maize fields take in markedly higher amounts of mycoestrogens.",Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,"['D000818', 'D000072480', 'D005260', 'D065928', 'D009183', 'D034421', 'D013552', 'D053719', 'D015025']","['Animals', 'Farms', 'Female', 'Forests', 'Mycotoxins', 'Sus scrofa', 'Swine', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Zearalenone']",Concentrations of zearalenone and its metabolites in female wild boars from woodlands and farmlands.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33766687,2021

A comparison of expression data with measurements of endogenous IAA via combined liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using heavy isotope labelled internal standards indicates that TaTAR2-B3, TaYUC9-A1, TaYUC9-B, TaYUC9-D1, TaYUC10-A and TaYUC10-D are primarily responsible for IAA production in developing grains. Furthermore, these genes are expressed specifically in developing grains, like those found in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). Our results cast doubt on the proposed role of THOUSAND-GRAIN WEIGHT gene, TaTGW6, in promoting larger grain size via negative effects on grain IAA content. Work on this gene overlooked the contribution of IAA biosynthesis from tryptophan. Although IAA synthesis occurs primarily in the endosperm, we show the TaYUC9-1 group is also strongly expressed in the embryo.

As scarce information is available, the current study is aimed at collecting new data on the co-occurrence and the fate of the most frequent masked, modified and emerging mycotoxins and other second fungal metabolites in maize food products and by-products. Three maize lots, obtained in different growing seasons, were processed using two different degermination processes, a dry-degermination system or a tempering-degermination one, in order to compare the interaction between mycotoxins and the dry-milling management system. Whole grain before and after cleaning, and all the products and the by-products were sampled twice for each lot and were subjected to a multi-mycotoxin LC-MS/MS analysis. More than 30 mycotoxins and other fungal metabolites, including masked or modified forms, co-occurred in all the maize milling fractions. Grain cleaning reduced all the detected fungal metabolites by 1.2-2 times, compared to the grain before cleaning. Animal feed flour showed the highest content of almost all the mycotoxins and fungal metabolites, with a consequent negative impact on animal health. Considering that for all the mycotoxins and fungal metabolites an inverse relationship with particle size was observed, flaking grits represented the healthiest maize products with the least contamination level, while the abatement was always lower for maize flour. Furthermore, the metabolites were variably redistributed in the maize fractions. The total aflatoxins, kojic acid, deoxynivalenol and its modified form, culmorin, and its associated forms, butenolide, fusaproliferin, fusaric acid, fusarinolic acid and, in some cases, zearalenone and its modified forms, and fusarin C were found to be concentrated significantly in the germ. Some of them also had a greater permanence in the maize food fractions and a weaker decontamination, both of which point to a higher risk of exposure for the end consumers.

The mixed-mode mechanism including molecular affinity adsorption (between aptamers and targets), hydrophilic interaction and ionic interaction (between stationary phase and targets) were adopted and provided a better flexibility in adjusting separation selectivity to reduce nonspecific adsorption with respect to the single mode. Preparation and characterization of aptamer-based affinity monoliths were investigated, The characterization of pore size distribution, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and the specificity and cross-reaction were also evaluated. As a result, the hydrophilic nature and negative charge on affinity monolith were obtained. Multiple interactions including aptamer affinity binding, hydrophilic interaction (HI) and ion exchange (IE) could be adopted for online selective extraction. Specific recognitions of polar ochratoxin A (OTA), non-polar zearalenone (ZEN) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was fulfilled with LODs as 0.03, 0.05 and 0.05 μg/L, respectively.

Along with the need for constant monitoring, there is a growing demand for rapid, non-destructive methods. Among these, Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) has made great headway for being an easy-to-use technology. NIR was applied in the present research to quantify the contamination level of total FBs, i.e., fumonisin B1+fumonisin B2 (FB1+FB2), and ZEN in Brazilian maize. From a total of six hundred and seventy-six samples, 236 were analyzed for FBs and 440 for ZEN. Three regression models were defined: one with 18 principal components (PCs) for FB1, one with 10 PCs for FB2, and one with 7 PCs for ZEN. Partial least square regression algorithm with full cross-validation was applied as internal validation. External validation was performed with 200 unknown samples (100 for FBs and 100 for ZEN). Correlation coefficient (R), determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), standard error of prediction (SEP) and residual prediction deviation (RPD) for FBs and ZEN were, respectively: 0.809 and 0.991; 0.899 and 0.984; 659 and 69.4; 682 and 69.8; and 3.33 and 2.71. No significant difference was observed between predicted values using NIR and reference values obtained by Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), thus indicating the suitability of NIR to rapidly analyze a large numbers of maize samples for FBs and ZEN contamination. The external validation confirmed a fair potential of the model in predicting FB1+FB2 and ZEN concentration.

Thus, the stability of pesticide residues in stored samples is required information for pesticide registration. We monitored the degradation rates of fluroxypyr and halosulfuron-methyl in maize straw, mature maize grain, and fresh corn matrices to evaluate their storage stability. Analytes were extracted and cleaned up with a modified Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) method and then detected with liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. We optimized the workflow by testing different clean-up sorbents, LC columns, and chromatographic methods. The linearity correlation coefficients of fluroxypyr and halosulfuron-methyl in the three matrices were ≥0.994. At three fortification levels, the mean recoveries of fluroxypyr and halosulfuron-methyl were 84.2-114.8% and 83.8-105.5% with relative standard deviations of 2.4-9.4% and 2.7-10.2%, respectively. Degradation of the two herbicides in the three matrices was less than 30% over the 70-day storage period, indicating fluroxypyr and halosulfuron-methyl are stable in the tested maize matrices when stored at -20 °C for at least 70 days.

The plants were grown in a growth chamber under recommended conditions and dosed by these chemicals for 19 days. The plant samples (stem transpiration stream) and solution in the exposure media were taken to measure transpiration stream concentration factor (TSCF). The plant samples were analyzed by a freeze-thaw centrifugation technique followed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection. Measured average TSCF values were used to test a neural network (NN) model previously developed for predicting plant uptake based on physicochemical properties. The results indicated that moderately hydrophobic compounds including carbamazepine and lincomycin have average TSCF values of 0.43 and 0.79, respectively. The average uptake of DEET, estriol, acetaminophen, and bisphenol A was also measured as 0.34, 0.29, 0.22, and 0.1, respectively. The 2,4-dinitrotoluene was not detected in the stem transpiration stream and it was shown to degrade in the root zone. Based on these results together with plant physiology measurements, we concluded that physicochemical properties of the chemicals did predict uptake, however, the role of other factors should be considered in the prediction of TSCF. While NN model could predict TSCF based on physicochemical properties with acceptable accuracies (mean squared error less than 0.25), the results for 2,4-dinitrotoluene and other compounds confirm the needs for considering other parameters related to both chemicals (stability) and plant species (role of lipids, lignin, and cellulose).",The Science of the total environment,"['D001692', 'D018551', 'D016571', 'D018517', 'D018526', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Biological Transport', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Transpiration', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Investigating plant uptake of organic contaminants through transpiration stream concentration factor and neural network models.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181989,2020

However, owing to recently introduced ""Horizontal Natural Product Transfer"" concept, concerns have been raised over how these common agricultural practices could potentially lead to toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), from decaying or burnt C. odorata residues, taken up by food crops and subsequently accumulate in the food chain. A field experiment was therefore conducted to analyze the PA contents in the tissues of maize (Zea mays L.) plants grown on slash-and-burn and slash-and-mulch plots, previously dominated with Chromolaena odorata, using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The results revealed, in general, trace amounts of PAs in the maize tissues (i.e. roots, leaves and grains) at maturity while significantly higher levels were detected in the surface soils sampled before sowing (for both plots), 45 days after sowing (slash-and-burn plot) and 90 days after sowing (slash-and-mulch plot). These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the leaching out of PAs from C. odorata residues (e.g. mulch and ash particles) and taken up by maize tissues.

Recently, the presence of modified forms of fumonisins in fumonisin-contaminated food products has been reported. In order to evaluate the health risk of modified forms of fumonisins to the Japanese population, we analyzed modified forms of fumonisins in corn-based products retailed in Japan. The modified and free forms of fumonisins in food samples were hydrolyzed by alkaline treatment. The resulting hydrolyzed fumonisins were quantified by LC-MS/MS, and total fumonisins (sum of modified and free forms) was calculated. A total of 166 samples of corn-based products were analyzed over two years. The relative ratios of mean total fumonisins to mean free fumonisins in the cornflakes, corn snacks, corn flour and powdered corn soup samples were 4.7, 2.8, 2.1 and 1.2, respectively. Total fumonisins in the residual solid of five cornflake and three corn snack samples obtained after extraction with methanol-water (3 : 1) were quantified. In the cornflakes and corn snacks samples, 56-72 and 83-98% of the modified forms of fumonisins were present in the residual solid, respectively. The average daily intake of fumonisins from cornflakes and corn snacks by the Japanese population was estimated at 1.1 to 3.9 ng/kg body weight/day when the results of free fumonisins were used for the estimate, but when the results of total fumonisins were used, average daily intake increased about three times and was estimated at 3.3 to 12.5 ng/kg body weigh/day.

We demonstrated that hydrogen production from intestinal fermentation could exacerbate DCS in rats fed with a standard diet. The aim of this study is to identify a fecal metabolomic signature that may result from the effects of a provocative hyperbaric exposure. The fecal metabolome was studied in two groups of rats previously fed with maize or soy in order to account for diet effects. 64 animals, weighing 379.0_20.2 g on the day of the dive, were exposed to the hyperbaric protocol. The rats were separated into two groups: 32 fed with maize (Div MAIZE) and 32 fed with soy (Div SOY). Gut fermentation before the dive was estimated by measuring exhaled hydrogen. Following hyperbaric exposure, we assessed for signs of DCS. Blood was analyzed to assay inflammatory cytokines. Conventional and ChemRICH approaches helped the metabolomic interpretation of the cecal content. The effect of the diet is very marked at the metabolomic level, a little less in the blood tests, without this appearing strictly in the clinic status. Nevertheless, 37 of the 184 metabolites analyzed are linked to clinical status. 35 over-expressed compounds let suggest less intestinal absorption, possibly accompanied by an alteration of the gut microbial community, in DCS.

However, the 3DXA are poorly extractable from grain tissue. This work aimed to determine the relative stability and extractability of sorghum 3-DXA vs anthocyanins from maize and cowpea under microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). UV-Vis and UPLC-MS/MS spectrometry were used to characterize the properties. The 3-DXA remained structurally stable to MAE conditions up to 1200 W/100 °C/30 min. MAE increased sorghum 3-DXA yield 100% versus control (3100 vs 1520 mg/g). On the other hand, both maize and cowpea anthocyanins were unstable and rapidly degraded under MAE. Cell wall-derived ferulate esters were detected in sorghum and maize MAE extracts, indicating cell wall degradation occurred during MAE. Thus the enhanced extraction of 3-DXA under MAE was due to their structural stability, along with improved diffusion from cell matrix due to microwave-induced sorghum cell wall disruption.",Food chemistry,"['D000872', 'D002851', 'D002853', 'D002523', 'D008872', 'D010936', 'D012639', 'D045868', 'D053719', 'D000070658', 'D003313']","['Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Microwaves', 'Plant Extracts', 'Seeds', 'Sorghum', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vigna', 'Zea mays']",Stability of 3-deoxyanthocyanin pigment structure relative to anthocyanins from grains under microwave assisted extraction.,"['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663754,2020

In order to provide valuable health-related information to consumers, the nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of raw and boiled purple sweet corn juices were herein investigated. Sugars, antinutrients, total free phenols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity were analyzed by conventional chemical methods. The viscosity and stability of juices were determined by Ubbelohde viscosity meter and centrifugation, respectively. Boiling process could elevate viscosity, stability and sugar content, and reduce antinutrients, total free phenols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity in corn juice. In addition, short time boiling efficiently reduced the degradation of anthocyanins during subsequent refrigeration. The content of amino acids, vitamin B1/B2 and E were detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography.

This study aimed to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of the consumption of a baked corn and bean snack (CBS) in an in vivo model of UC using 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) as inductor of colitis. CD-1 mice (45, n = 9/group) were randomly separated into 5 groups, treated for 6-weeks as follows: G1 (basal diet, BD), G2 (2% DSS), G3 (20 g CBS/body weight BW/day + BD), G4 (40 g CBS/BW/day + BD) and G5 (60 g CBS/BW/day + BD). BW, Disease Activity Index (DAI), and feces were collected throughout the treatment. After euthanasia, organs (spleen, liver, and colon) were excised and weighed. Feces were analyzed for β-glucuronidase (β-GLUC) activity and gas-chromatography. The colons were analyzed for histopathology, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and gene analysis. At the end of treatments, among the DSS-induced groups, G3 exhibited the lowest BW losses (11.5%), MPO activity (10.4%) and β-GLUC (8.6%). G4 presented the lowest DAI (0.88), relative spleen weight, and histological inflammation score (p < 0.05). Compared to G2, CBS consumption significantly (p < 0.05) reduced serum TNF-α, IL-10, and MCP-1 levels. The fecal metabolome analysis ranked 9-decenoic acid, decane, and butyric acid as the main contributors of pathways associated with the β-oxidation of fatty acids.

In this study, 579 wheat samples and 606 maize samples intended for consumption were collected from China in 2017 and analyzed to determine the co-occurrence of type-B trichothecenes (DON, 3-ADON, and 15-ADON). All the wheat samples tested positive for DON, while 99.83% of the maize samples were DON-positive with mean DON concentrations of 165.87 and 175.30 μg/kg, respectively. Per the Chinese standard limits for DON, 3.63% of wheat and 2.97% of the maize samples were above the maximum limit of 1000 μg/kg. The DON derivatives (3-ADON and 15-ADON) were less frequently found and were present at lower levels than DON in wheat. 3-ADON and 15-ADON had incidences of 13.53% and 76.40%, respectively, in maize. By analyzing the distribution ratio of DON and its derivatives in wheat and maize, DON (95.51%) was the predominant toxin detected in wheat samples, followed by 3.97% for the combination of DON + 3-ADON, while DON + 3-ADON + 15-ADON and DON + 15-ADON were only found in 0.17% and 0.35% of wheat samples, respectively. Additionally, a large amount of the maize samples were contaminated with DON + 15-ADON (64.19%) and DON (22.11%). The samples with a combination of DON + 3-ADON and DON + 3-ADON + 15-ADON accounted for 1.32% and 12.21%, respectively. Only one maize sample did not contain all three mycotoxins.

32218143,"The occurrence of deoxynivalenol (DON) in animal feed is a serious issue for the livestock industry. Approaches using mycotoxin adsorbents are key to decreasing mycotoxin carryover from contaminated feed to animals. In this paper, a novel functional microsphere adsorbent comprising an alginate/carboxymethyl cellulose sodium composite loaded with calcium (SA/CMC-Ca) was prepared by an emulsification process to adsorb DON from polluted corn steep liquor (CSL) containing DON at a concentration of 3.60 μg/mL. Batch experiments were conducted under different experimental conditions: CSL volumes, reaction times, desorption times, and microsphere recyclability. Results showed that 5 g of microspheres reacted with 5 mL of DON-polluted CSL for 5 min, the microspheres can be recycled 155 times, and the maximum DON adsorption for the microspheres was 2.34 μg/mL. During recycling, microspheres were regenerated by deionized water every time; after the microspheres were cleaned, DON in the deionized water was degraded by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 70 °C for 1 h at pH 12. The mechanism for physical adsorption and hydrogen bonding was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR).

With this purpose, a QuEChERS-based extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) were used. Analytical results showed that 78 cereal samples (65%) were contaminated with at least one toxin, while 50% were contaminated with three to nine mycotoxins. T-2 toxin, citrinin, beauvericin and deoxynivalenol were the most commonly found mycotoxins (frequency of 50%, 41.6%, 40.8% and 33.3%, respectively). Fumonisins (B1 + B2), enniatins B and B1, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone registered high concentrations (289-48878 µg/kg, 1.2-5288 µg/kg, 15-4569 µg/kg, 48-2055 µg/kg and 10.4-579 µg/kg, respectively). Furthermore, concentrations higher than those allowed by the European Union (EU) were observed in 21, 8 and 1 samples for fumonisins, zearalenone and deoxinivalenol, respectively. As a conclusion, the high levels of fumonisins (B1 + B2) in maize and deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and HT-2 + T-2 toxins in wheat, represent a health risk for the average adult consumer in Algeria.

We investigated their interactive effects on the translocation and uptake of Se and Cd from soils to crops. Corn (Zea mays L.) roots, stems, leaves, and grains, and their corresponding rhizosphere soils were collected from naturally Se-Cd rich areas in Wumeng Mountain, Guizhou, China. The Se and Cd levels were determined in the soils, roots, stems, leaves, and grains. Soil bioavailable Se and Cd were also determined. The low soil bioavailable molar ratios for Se and Cd (Se:Cd) (≤0.7) improved Cd accumulation in the plants. However, relatively high Se:Cd molar ratios (>0.7) in the soils prevented Cd from entering the plants, but the effect of the soil Se:Cd on Se accumulation in corn was not significant. The strong anion exchange-high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (SAX-HPLC-ICP-MS) chromatograms showed that Se-Cd complexes occurred in the leaves, which likely indicated that direct interactions between Se and Cd happened there.

31725878,"Armyworm feeding in large, destructive groups is hugely difficult to control and the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (Walk), is one such pest. In this study, we reported a semisynthetic artificial diet for the oriental armyworm. This diet is based on Ritter's diet, a formula developed for Heliothis zea. The survival of M. separata was extremely low and only around 2% insects can reach the adult stage on Ritter's diet. But, it can reach up to 100% if corn leaf powder (CLP) was mixed, and insects grew faster and gained more mass. After testing a set of mixtures of Ritter's diet and CLP, we found that 14.3% was the optimal proportion of CLP for making the artificial diet. We then used chloroform to extract CLP. Insect performance was still much better on Ch-extracted CLP diets than that on Ritter's diet, but it was poorer than that on the diets containing unprocessed CLP, suggesting that the essential factor(s) was only partially extracted from corn leaf. We then used methanol and dichloromethane, two solvents differing in their polarity, to process the extractions and analyzed the extracted chemicals using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Insects had a better performance on dichloromethane-extracted CLP diet in comparison to methanol-extracted one, indicating that the important factor(s) is more prone to methanol extraction.

In the presence of ZEN, the inhibit sequence (Inh) is released from the aptamer-trigger sequence (Apt-T) via the binding of ZEN and the aptamer of Apt-T. The free Apt-T acts as a switch that opens the hairpins H1 and H2 to generate H1-H2 complex. The released Apt-T is available to trigger the next round of CHA between H1 and H2. Finally, the hybridization between H1 and the Ag NCs probe (P) causes the G-rich sequence to be in close proximity to the dark Ag NCs encapsulated by P.

We investigated the metabolization of aflatoxins in chickens by analyzing excreta and ileal content and developed and validated a biomarker method for detection of aflatoxins and their metabolites in these matrices. Analysis of ileal content served to distinguish between urinary and fecal excretion combined in the excreta samples. During a 3-wk animal trial, one hundred sixty-eight 1-day-old chicks were randomly allocated to 24 pens with 7 chicks per pen and subjected to different feed regimens with: A) toxin-free feed, B) feed supplemented with 18 ng of total aflatoxins/g, and C) feed supplemented with 515 ng of total aflatoxins/g. Chicken excreta and ileal content were sampled after 7, 14, and 21 D. An analytical method based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was validated for the determination of aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2, M1, P1, Q1, and aflatoxin B1-N7-guanine (AFB1-N7-Gua) in chicken's samples. Comparing chicken excreta, which contain urine and feces, to ileal content, which contains no urine, we explored the secretion pathway of aflatoxin metabolites. The AFB1-N7-Gua was only detected in excreta, whereas aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) was detected both in ileal content and excreta. Aflatoxin M1 was detected in excreta in concentrations 5 times higher than in ileal content, suggesting primary excretion via urine. Although chickens are relatively resistant to aflatoxins, contamination of feed can lead to adverse effects and thus economic losses in farming. Therefore, a biomarker method to estimate the exposure of chickens to aflatoxins can play an important role to monitor the animals' health.",Poultry science,"['D000348', 'D000821', 'D000822', 'D000818', 'D015415', 'D002645', 'D002853', 'D005243', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005766', 'D053719']","['Aflatoxins', 'Animal Feed', 'Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Feces', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Gastrointestinal Contents', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Determination of aflatoxin biomarkers in excreta and ileal content of chickens.,"['Q000302', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","['isolation & purification', 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198963,2020

Here substrate specificity of CYP71Z18 was further explored through microbial metabolic engineering and it was identified to accept multiple rice diterpenes as substrates for oxidation. One CYP71Z18 enzymatic product derived from syn-pimaradiene was identified as 15,16-epoxy-syn-pimaradiene by NMR analysis, which was further elaborated by CYP99A3 to generate C19 hydroxylated product. 15,16-epoxy-syn-pimaradien-19-ol exhibited inhibitory effect on spore germination and appressorium formation of the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Overexpression of CYP71Z18 in rice resulted in accumulation of several new diterpenoids, indicating promiscuous activity in planta.

It has been understood since the early 1980s that in most parts of Canada, the predominant chemotype of F. graminearum is 15ADON, and not the 3ADON chemotype mainly found in Europe and Asia. The discovery of F. graminearum strains that did not produce DON but the structurally related 7-α hydroxy, 15-deacetylcalonectrin (3ANX) and its hydrolysis product 7-α hydroxy, 3,15-dideacetylcalonectrin to (NX) demonstrated that we still have a lot to learn about this well studied but complicated fungus. We conducted a survey of maize and wheat samples from Ontario farms. In the 2015 crop year, we isolated 86 strains and tested a representative subset of 20 using the published genetic probes for assessing genotype. We also developed a targeted LC-MS/MS method for the identification and quantitation of known toxins from this species to determine chemotype. The results showed that 80% of our strains produced some 3ANX in addition to 15ADON and one strain produced 3ANX and no 15ADON. Comparison of chemical data with genotyping revealed that in more than 50% of the cases there was no clear agreement. These data demonstrate the importance of chemical analysis for understanding the toxigenic potential of strains, especially using a LC-MS method that is capable of differentiating 3ADON and 15ADON. For this collection, genotyping of isolates did not produce reliable information on the chemotype.

Industrial feed fortificants used to improve egg yolk color and carotenoid concentration typically are derived from marigold flowers. Green leafy vegetables are also concentrated sources of the xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin (L+Z), but they have not been rigorously evaluated in laying hen feeds as a yolk colorant. The addition of food manufacturing byproducts, including carrot leaves, to animal feed is a promoted method of improving animal nutrition. The ability of dehydrated carrot leaves to improve egg yolk color and L+Z concentration was evaluated by feeding laying hens (n = 40) white maize-based feeds fortified with 2 different dehydrated carrot leaves, marigold as a positive control, or no fortificant as a negative control for 28 D. After a 7-D washout period, the hens were separated into 4 groups, and eggs were collected every other day. Yolks were analyzed by using a portable colorimeter to define the color space and by ultra-performance liquid chromatography to determine the carotenoid profile. Carotenoid concentration rapidly declined from day 0 to 8, confirming adequate washout conditions.

The challenges arise from not only the extremely low content of GAs in complex plant matrices, but the poor detectability of GAs by mass spectrometry (MS) in negative ion mode. In an effort to solve these urgent difficulties, we present a spatial-resolved analysis method to investigate the distribution of GAs in tiny plant tissues based on a simplified one-pot sample preparation approach coupled with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem MS. By integrating extraction and derivatization into one step, target GAs were effectively extracted from plant materials and simultaneously reacted with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide, the sample preparation time was largely shortened, the probability of sample loss was minimized and the detection sensitivity of MS was also greatly improved compared with underivatized GAs. Under optimal conditions, the method was validated from the quantification linearity, limits of detection and limits of quantification in the presence of plant matrices, recoveries, and precision. With the proposed method, 15 endogenous GAs were detected and, among these, 11 GAs could be quantified in 0.50 mg fresh weight (FW) wheat shoot samples, and five GAs were quantified in only 0.15 mg FW developing seed samples of Arabidopsis thaliana.

30994936,"Pigmented maize has been extensively studied due to its high anthocyanin content. This study has been focused mainly on kernel, although the whole plant of purple corn is a potential source of anthocyanins. First, general parameters of extraction (solvent system, solvent-to-solid ratio, number of extractions, and acid type) were established depending on the total anthocyanins content. Then, three extraction methods to access anthocyanins were compared: maceration extraction (ME), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). Since the residual material still possessed an intense color, a further treatment was performed by application of enzymatic-assisted extraction (EAE). Three enzymatic cocktails (Xylanases, Celluclast, and Depol), pH, and temperature were evaluated to establish optimal reaction conditions. Subsequent analysis and identification of the anthocyanins obtained by four different extraction techniques were performed using HPLC and HPLC-mass spectrometry, respectively. The most efficient method was UAE using 20 min of ultrasound (100 W) preceded by sample treatment in the following conditions: ethanol/water/lactic acid mixture (80:19:1), two extractions, 1:10 solvent-to-solid ratio. As a result, anthocyanins from corn cob and corn husk were extracted at concentrations of 24.32 and 25.80 mg/gDW, respectively. No difference in the anthocyanins profile for samples extracted by three different methods was observed. However, an enhanced presence of cyanidin-3-(6''malonyl)glucoside was detected in the sample corresponding to the EAE method. Therefore, the Cahuacintle corn husk can be considered as a competitive source of anthocyanins with the available commercial sources. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The by-products obtained from Cacahuacintle purple corn can be potentially used as natural colorants thanks to their anthocyanins content. In this work, we established the most efficient extraction method of anthocyanins from corn husk and corn cob, and demonstrated that their anthocyanins profile is comparable to other Peruvian purple corns, which are currently used as natural colorants. Therefore, the extraction procedure described in this study might be scaled-up in an industrial process to get access to anthocyanins from undervalued wastes.",Journal of food science,"['D000872', 'D002851', 'D003116', 'D005524', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D010568', 'D010936', 'D018514', 'D012997', 'D013045', 'D003313']","['Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Color', 'Food Technology', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Peru', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Structures', 'Solvents', 'Species Specificity', 'Zea mays']",Extraction and Identification of Anthocyanins in Corn Cob and Corn Husk from Cacahuacintle Maize.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994936,2019

Herein, a novel, simple and label-free fluorescent aptasensor, based on quaternized tetraphenylethene salt (TPE-Z), graphene oxide (GO) and AFB1 aptamer, has been constructed to detect AFB1. In the presence of AFB1, AFB1 aptamer undergoes a conformational switch from single stranded structure to the AFB1/AFB1 aptamer complex upon target binding, which induces the release of TPE-Z/AFB1 aptamer from the surface of GO. Thus, the fluorescence of TPE-Z/AFB1 aptamer is recovered. The assay can be performed by simply mixing TPE-Z, AFB1 aptamer, the GO and the AFB1 samples with a detection limit of 0.25 ng/mL.

30828760,"In this paper, a fluorescent method was developed for ochratoxin A (OTA) detection that uses iron-doped porous carbon (MPC) and aptamer-functionalized nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs-Apt) as probes. In this method, the adsorbance of the NGQDs-Apt on the MPC due to a π-π interaction between the aptamer and the MPC results in the quenching of the fluorescence of the NGQDs-Apt. However, since OTA interacts strongly with the aptamer, the presence of OTA leads to the detachment of the NGQDs-Apt from the MPC, resulting in the resumption of fluorescence from the NGQDs-Apt. When exonuclease I (Exo I) is also added to the solution, this exonuclease specifically digests the aptamer, leading to the release of the OTA back into the solution. This free OTA then interacts with another MPC-NGQDs-Apt system, inducing the release of more NGQDs into the solution, which enhances the fluorescent intensity compared to that of the system with no Exo I. Utilizing this behavior of OTA in the presence of NGQDs-Apt, it was possible to detect concentrations of OTA ranging from 10 to 5000 nM, with a limit of detection of 2.28 nM. Our method was tested by applying it to the detection of OTA in wheat and corn samples. This method has four advantages: (1) the magnetic porous carbon is easy to prepare, its porosity enhances its loading capacity for NGQDs, it highly efficiently quenches the fluorescence of the NGQDs, and its magnetic properties facilitate the separation of the MPC from other species in solution; (2) applying double magnetic separation decreases the background signal; (3) Exo I digests the free aptamer effectively, which allows the resulting free OTA to induce the release of more NGQDs-Apt, ultimately enhancing the fluorescent signal; and (4) the proposed method presented high sensitivity and a wide linear detection range. This method may prove helpful in food safety analysis and new biosensor development (achieved by using different aptamer sequences to that used in the present work).

It is estimated that more than 80% of human exposure to dioxins and related compounds comes from the consumption of animal-origin food, and farm animals are exposed to dioxins mainly through the feed. A monitoring programme for dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs)) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) was conducted in the Polish feed market between 2004 and 2017. Using two complementary ISO 17025-accredited analytical methods (bioassay and high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS)), 2919 samples of plant, animal and minerals origin were analysed. The total number of samples exceeding the maximum limit (ML) was 52, which is 1.8% of all tested samples. They all contained PCDD/Fs in concentrations over the ML, and in 16 samples the limit for the sum of PCDD/F/DL-PCBs was also exceeded. The highest dioxins level was found in feedstuffs derived from Baltic fish; the fish oil was followed by fish meal. Low-chlorinated furans (2.3,7,8 TCDF, 2,3,4,7,8-PCDF and 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF) were dominant and these congeners accounted for the toxicity expressed in WHO toxic equivalents (WHO-TEQ). In this category, 155 out of the 498 samples (32%) exceeded the action threshold (AT) for PCDD/Fs and in 10 samples (2.0%) for DL-PCBs. Non-compliant fish meals were found in 34 (5.6%) of the tested samples, in 0.7% of compound feeds, and in 1.5% of plant-origin materials. Seven dried plant-derived materials contained PCDD/F level above ML, including alfalfa, maize, apple, basil and beet pulp pellets containing molasses. The dry vegetable materials were mostly contaminated by the 2,3,7,8-furans, the congeners arising from a faulty drying process. No significant time trend can be seen. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that concentrations of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in Polish feed materials were sufficiently low to ensure low concentrations in animal-derived products.","Food additives & contaminants.

Under optimal conditions, the sensing method lowered the limits of detection (LOD) to 0.16, 0.52, and 1.21 µg/kg in maize and 0.18, 0.57, and 1.47 µg/kg in peanut with an analytical range of 0.48⁻20, 1.56⁻200, and 3.63⁻300 µg/kg for AFB₁, ZEA and CTN, respectively. The protocol could be completed within 15 min, including sample preparation and lateral flow immunoassay. The recovery range was 83.24⁻110.80%. An excellent correlation was observed between this approach and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for mycotoxins and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for pesticide in maize and peanut.

Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony molecular phylogenetic analyses of single and multilocus DNA sequence data indicated that the strains represented 46 genealogically exclusive phylogenetically distinct species distributed among eight species complexes. Moreover, the phylogenetic data revealed that 80/158 strains were received under a name that is not accepted today (ex F. moniliforme) or classified under a different species name. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and/or high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS)-based mycotoxin analyses were conducted to determine which toxins the strains could produce in liquid and/or solid cultures. All of the trichothecene toxin-producing fusaria were nested within the F. sambucinum (FSAMSC) or F. incarnatum-equiseti (FIESC) species complexes. Consistent with this finding, GC-MS analyses detected trichothecenes in agmatine-containing broth or rice culture extracts of all 13 FSAMSC and 10/12 FIESC species tested.

30466136,"Zearalenone (ZEA) is a toxic metabolite of Fusarium genera that frequently contaminates cereal grains. India being a tropical country provides suitable conditions for fungal invasion to the cereals. In the absence of any regulatory limits for ZEA in India, the present study was carried out to analyze the contamination levels of ZEA in different cereal samples consumed by Indian population and its exposure assessment through intake. Out of 117 cereal samples comprising of wheat, rice, corn, and oats, 70 (84%) were found to be positive for ZEA contamination, among which 24 (33%) samples exceeded the permissible limits proposed by European Union when analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The positive samples were further validated by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS) analysis. Based on the quantitative estimation of ZEA contamination in cereals and their daily consumption values, the probable daily intake of ZEA was found to be 16.9- and 7.9-fold higher in rice and wheat samples, respectively, than the tolerable daily intake prescribed by European Food Safety Authority. The presence of ZEA at high levels indicates a higher exposure risk for Indian population as wheat and rice are staple foods in India. Thus, there is an immediate need to set the permissible levels of ZEA in India to safeguard the health of 1.34 billion people. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: High levels of ZEA contaminated wheat and rice samples suggest that the consumers are at a greater exposure risk. The study will help the Indian regulatory bodies to set the permissible level of ZEA in different cereal grains so as to safeguard the health of common masses.

Most current approaches can be used to analyze a few known HCAAs in a given plant. A novel method for comprehensive detection of plant HCAAs is urgently needed. In this study, a deep annotation method of HCAAs was proposed on the basis of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) and its in silico database of HCAAs. To construct an in silico UHPLC-HRMS HCAAs database, a total of 846 HCAAs were generated from the most common phenolic acid and polyamine/aromatic monoamine substrates according to possible biosynthesis reactions, which represent the structures of plant-specialized HCAAs. The characteristic MS/MS fragmentation patterns of HCAAs were extracted from reference mixtures. Four quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) models were developed to predict retention times of mono-trans-HCAAs (aromatic amines conjugates), mono-trans-HCAAs (aliphatic amines conjugates), bis-HCAAs, and tris-HCAAs. The developed method was applied for identifying HCAAs in seeds (maize, wheat, and rice), roots (rice), and leaves (rice and tobacco). A total of 79 HCAAs were detected: 42 of them were identified in these plants for the first time, and 20 of them have never been reported to exist in plants. The results showed that the developed method can be used to identify HCAAs in a plant without prior knowledge of HCAA distributions.

Sclerotia of C. gigantea were collected in fields with high incidence of the disease, ground and analysed for nutrients. Experimental diets were prepared with four treatments, where sclerotial powder was added, substituting for alfalfa flour in increasing proportions [C. gigantea/alfalfa flour (0:100, 5:95, 15:85 and 25:75)]. Total ergot alkaloid content was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Male juvenile rabbits were utilised and distributed in completely randomised design with four replications. Initial weight was recorded in each animal, and experimental diet was offered. In this study, weight of animals, feed consumption and feed conversion were evaluated in individual animals.

In rye, recessive mutations in six genes (vi1...vi6) lead to the absence of anthocyanins in all parts of the plant. Moreover, dominant genes of anthocyanin synthesis in aleurone (gene C) and pericarp (gene Vs) also affect the color of the grain. Reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to study anthocyanins in 24 rye samples. A lack of anthocyanins in the lines with yellow and brown grain was determined. Delphinidin rutinoside and cyanidin rutinoside were found in the green-seeded lines. Six samples with violet grains significantly varied in terms of anthocyanin composition and content. However, the main aglycone was cyanidin or peonidin in all of them. Monosaccharide glucose and disaccharide rutinose served as the glycoside units. Violet-seeded accession forms differ in the ratio of the main anthocyanins and the range of their acylated derivatives. The acyl groups were presented mainly by radicals of malonic and sinapic acids. For the colored forms, a profile of the revealed anthocyanins with the indication of their contents was given. The obtained results are discussed in connection to similar data in rice, barley, and wheat, which will provide a perspective for future investigations.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000872', 'D002851', 'D013058', 'D012275', 'D010858', 'D012434', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oryza', 'Pigmentation', 'Secale', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Anthocyanin Composition and Content in Rye Plants with Different Grain Color.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29671758,2018
29574560,"A fundamental step in addressing the global problem of mycotoxins is the development of highly sensitive, multi-class extraction and detection methods. This constitutes a field of research that has in recent years enjoyed a steady advance. Such methods, generally based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, are widely reported successfully detecting various mycotoxins in different food and feed samples. In this work, an innovative approach to multi-class mycotoxin control is proposed, offering specific advantages: a broader inclusion of more mycotoxin classes, robust and thorough extraction for all target compounds despite their varied chemical properties, and determination of all analytes from a single injection. The method involved the extraction and quantification of the main mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium fungi, as well as their reported derivatives, together with 12 other compounds most commonly produced by Claviceps purpurea. The popularly reported QuEChERS technique has been reduced to a simple ""salting-out liquid-liquid extraction"" (SO-LLE) to obtain the most efficient extraction of the aforementioned mycotoxin classes in a very short time. This is in particular extremely important in ensuring correct determination of individual ergot alkaloids, for which short and robust sample preparation as well as short analytical sequences were key for minimizing the epimerization during analysis. The analyses of wheat and maize samples were performed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Matrix-matched calibration curves were established and limits of quantification were below the maximum levels established by the EU regulation. The precision (repeatability and intermediate precision) was lower than 13% in all cases and recoveries ranged between 60 and 98% in maize and between 62 and 103% in wheat, fulfilling the current legislation. The method was applied to study the co-occurrence of these mycotoxins in wheat (n = 13) and maize (n = 15) samples from six European countries. A successful quantification of 23 different mycotoxins, from all major classes, in 85% of wheat and 93% of maize samples was achieved.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002138', 'D002851', 'D002523', 'D004876', 'D005060', 'D005506', 'D005658', 'D064088', 'D057230', 'D059625', 'D009183', 'D021241', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Calibration', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Ergot Alkaloids', 'Europe', 'Food Contamination', 'Fungi', 'Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points', 'Limit of Detection', 'Liquid-Liquid Extraction', 'Mycotoxins', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",In-house validation of a rapid and efficient procedure for simultaneous determination of ergot alkaloids and other mycotoxins in wheat and maize.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29574560,2018

However, many determination methods focused on a single mycotoxin, highlighting the demand for on-site determination of multiple mycotoxins in a single run. We develop a multicolor-based immunochromatographic strip (ICS) for simultaneous determination of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), zearalenone (ZEN) and T-2 toxin in maize- and cereal-based animal feeds. The nanoparticles with different colors are conjugated with three monoclonal antibodies, which serve as the immunoassay probes. The decrease in color intensity is observed by the naked eyes, providing simultaneous quantification of three mycotoxins. The visible limits of detection for AFB1, ZEN and T-2 are estimated to be 0.5, 2, and 30 ng/mL, respectively. The cut-off values are 1, 10, and 50 ng/mL, respectively. Considerable specificity and stability are found using real samples. The results are in excellent agreement with those from high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.

The level of As, Cd, Ni, Pb, and Sn was significantly decreased in Se-rich rice, whereas As content was increased. In turn, the decrease in Al, As, Cd, Ni, Pb, and Sn levels in Se-rich maize was associated with a significant elevation of Hg content. Finally, Se-rich mustard was characterized by a significant increase in Al, As, and Hg levels, while the content of Ni, Pb, and Sn was significantly lower than the control levels.

29037679,"The determination of iron in fortified foods is mandatory by many global regulatory agencies. However, the spectroscopic techniques require elevated investments limiting their applicability especially in developing countries. Therefore, simple, viable and analytical methods with sufficient sensitivity can become an alternative. In this work, a sensitive, simple and viable spectrophotometry method to determine iron in wheat and maize flours was developed following a cloud point extraction (CPE) procedure. The analyte was first complexed with 2-(5-Bromine-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol (Br-PADAP) in the presence of the surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-114). For the CPE optimization the variables: pH of the medium, stoichiometry of the complex, surfactant, and salt concentrations were evaluated. Linearity in the analytical blank was obtained by using the square root of absorbance (Abs) in order to adjust the residues of the curve.

28914589,"In recent years, there has been an increased concern about the presence of toxic compounds derived from the Maillard reaction produced during food cooking at high temperatures. The main toxic compounds derived from this reaction are acrylamide and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The majority of analytical methods require sample treatments using solvents which are highly polluting for the environment. The difficulty of quantifying HMF in complex fried food matrices encourages the development of new analytical methods. This paper provides a rapid, sensitive and environmentally-friendly analytical method for the quantification of HMF in corn chips using HPLC-DAD. Chromatographic separation resulted in a baseline separation for HMF in 3.7 min. Sample treatment for corn chip samples first involved a leaching process using water and afterwards a solid-phase extraction (SPE) using HLB-Oasis polymeric cartridges. Sample treatment optimisation was carried out by means of Box-Behnken fractional factorial design and Response Surface Methodolog y to examine the effects of four variables (sample weight, pH, sonication time and elution volume) on HMF extraction from corn chips. The SPE-HPLC-DAD method was validated. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.82 and 2.20 mg kg","Food additives & contaminants.

However, these labels have low sensitivity and are costly, in particular, for trace detection of mycotoxins in cereals. Here, we provided a simple preparation procedure for amorphous carbon nanoparticles (ACNPs) and described multiplex LFAs employing ACNPs as labels (ACNP-LFAs) for detecting three Fusarium mycotoxins. The analytical performance of ACNPs in LFA was compared to GNPs and QDs using the same immunoreagents, except for the labels, allowing for their analytical characteristics to be objectively compared. The visual limit of detection for ACNP-LFAs in buffer was 8-fold better than GNPs and 2-fold better than QDs.

30682974,"Fusarium graminearum is an important causal agent of maize seedling blight. The species includes several chemotypes that produce various forms of deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV). To understand the effects and roles of F. graminearum mycotoxins on maize seedling blight occurring at Zhang Ye of Gansu, China, 23 isolates of F. graminearum were collected and characterized. A PCR assay showed all 23 isolates belonged to the 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON) genotype. This was also confirmed by production of both DON and 15-ADON in either rice culture medium or maize seedling roots, detected by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In maize seedling roots, 15-ADON dominated at 6 days post inoculation (dpi) and DON was the main mycotoxin at 12 dpi. The biomass of F. graminearum doubled from 6 to 12 dpi, and was positively correlated with virulence of the isolates. Both mycotoxins affected maize root vitality, but 15-ADON had a greater effect than DON. ALDH9 and MDH, two dehydrogenase synthesis genes in maize, showed a lower relative expression in 15-ADON treatments than in DON treatments. It indicated that both mycotoxins affected seed germination and root development, with 15-ADON being more destructive. Under scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, root hair formation and development were delayed by DON, but completely inhibited by 15-ADON. 15-ADON caused cell shrinkage, loose cellular structure, and widened intercellular spaces; it also destroyed organelles and caused plasmolysis, and eventually ruptured cell membranes causing cell death. DON did not affect cell morphology and arrangement, but altered the morphology of organelles, forming concentric membranous bodies and a large amount of irregular lipid droplets. Thus, both mycotoxins contributed to symptom expression of maize seedling blight, but 15-ADON was more destructive than DON.",Plant disease,[],[],Roles of Genotype-Determined Mycotoxins in Maize Seedling Blight Caused by Fusarium graminearum.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682974,2019
28591565,"Lepidopteran larvae secrete saliva on plant tissues during feeding. Components in the saliva may aid in food digestion, whereas other components are recognized by plants as cues to elicit defense responses. Despite the ecological and economical importance of these plant-feeding insects, knowledge of their saliva composition is limited to a few species. In this study, we identified the salivary proteins of larvae of the fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda; determined qualitative and quantitative differences in the salivary proteome of the two host races-corn and rice strains-of this insect; and identified changes in total protein concentration and relative protein abundance in the saliva of FAW larvae associated with different host plants. Quantitative proteomic analyses were performed using labeling with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 98 proteins were identified (>99% confidence) in the FAW saliva. These proteins were further categorized into five functional groups: proteins potentially involved in (1) plant defense regulation, (2) herbivore offense, (3) insect immunity, (4) detoxification, (5) digestion, and (6) other functions. Moreover, there were differences in the salivary proteome between the FAW strains that were identified by label-free proteomic analyses. Thirteen differentially identified proteins were present in each strain. There were also differences in the relative abundance of eleven salivary proteins between the two FAW host strains as well as differences within each strain associated with different diets. The total salivary protein concentration was also different for the two strains reared on different host plants. Based on these results, we conclude that the FAW saliva contains a complex mixture of proteins involved in different functions that are specific for each strain and its composition can change plastically in response to diet type.",Insect biochemistry and molecular biology,"['D000818', 'D012275', 'D020543', 'D040901', 'D012463', 'D013045', 'D018411', 'D003313']","['Animals', 'Oryza', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Saliva', 'Species Specificity', 'Spodoptera', 'Zea mays']",Quantitative proteomic analysis of the fall armyworm saliva.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28591565,2017

The phytase inhibition is dose dependent and varies significantly between cereal species, between cultivars of barley and cultivars of wheat and between Fusarium graminearum infected and non-infected wheat grains. The highest endpoint level of phytase activity inhibition was 90%, observed with grain protein extracts (GPE) from F. graminearum infected wheat. Wheat GPE from grains infected with F. graminearum inhibits phytase activity significantly more than GPE from non-infected grains. For four barley cultivars studied, the IC50 value ranged from 0.978 ± 0.271 to 3.616 ± 0.087 mg×ml-1. For two non-infected wheat cultivars investigated, the IC50 values were varying from 2.478 ± 0.114 to 3.038 ± 0.097 mg×ml-1. The maize and rice cultivars tested gaveIC50 values on 0.983 ± 0.205 and 1.972 ± 0.019 mg×ml-1, respectively. After purifying the inhibitor from barley grains via Superdex G200, an approximately 30-35 kDa protein was identified. No clear trend for the mechanism of inhibition could be identified via Michaelis-Menten kinetics and Lineweaver-Burk plots. However, testing of the purified phytase inhibitor together with the A. ficuum phytase and the specific protease inhibitors pepstatin A, E64, EDTA and PMSF revealed that pepstatin A repealed the phytase inhibition.

Several analytical methods have been published in the literature dealing with mycotoxins determination in cereals. Nevertheless, in the present work, the aim was to propose an easy and effective system for the extraction of six of the main mycotoxins from corn meal and durum wheat flour, i.e., the main four aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and the mycoestrogen zearalenone. The developed method exploited magnetic solid phase extraction (SPE), a technique that is attracting an increasing interest as an alternative to classical SPE. Therefore, the use of magnetic graphitized carbon black as a suitable extracting material was tested. The same magnetic material proved to be effective in the extraction of mycoestrogens from milk, but has never been applied to complex matrices as cereals. Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for detection. Recoveries were >60% in both cereals, even if the matrix effects were not negligible.

Despite strong evidence supporting its beneficial use in agriculture, there are concerns that chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, could present a risk to terrestrial ecosystems and human health. Triclosan is one of the most commonly detected compounds in biosolids. To date, laboratory studies indicate that triclosan likely poses a de minimis risk to field crops; however, these studies were either conducted under unrealistic exposure conditions or only assessed 1 or 2 formulations of biosolids. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of triclosan on field crops in soils amended with 4 different formulations of biosolids (liquid, dewatered, compost, and alkaline-hydrolyzed), containing both background and spiked triclosan concentrations, following best management practices used in the province of Ontario.

Also, little is known about masked and emerging toxins and metabolites. 1926 samples from 52 countries were analysed for toxins and metabolites. Of 162 compounds detected, up to 68 metabolites were found in a single sample. A subset of 1113 finished feed, maize and maize silage samples containing 57 compounds from 2012 to 2015 from 44 countries was investigated using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEN) and fumonisins showed large increases of annual medians in Europe. Within a region, distinct trends were observed, suggesting importance of local meteorology and cultivars. In 2015, median DON concentrations increased to 1400 μ g·kg - 1 in Austria, but were stable in Germany at 350 μ g·kg - 1 . In 2014, enniatins occurred at median concentrations of 250 μ g·kg - 1 in Europe, at levels similar to DON and ZEN. The latter were frequently correlated with DON-3-glucoside and ZEN-14-sulfate. Co-occurrence of regulated toxins was frequent with e.g., enniatins, and moniliformin. Correlation was observed between DON and DON-3-glucoside and with beauvericin. Results indicate that considerably more than 25% of agricultural commodities could be contaminated with mycotoxins as suggested by FAO, although this is at least partly due to the lower limits of detection in the current survey.

27556579,"Host cell proteins (HCP) are a problematic set of impurities in downstream processing (DSP) as they behave most similarly to the target protein during separation. Approaching DSP with the knowledge of HCP separation behavior would be beneficial for the production of high purity recombinant biologics. Therefore, this work was aimed at characterizing the separation behavior of complex mixtures of HCP during a commonly used method: anion-exchange chromatography (AEX). An additional goal was to evaluate the performance of a statistical methodology, based on the characterization data, as a tool for predicting protein separation behavior. Aqueous two-phase partitioning followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis provided data on the three physicochemical properties most commonly exploited during DSP for each HCP: pI (isoelectric point), molecular weight, and surface hydrophobicity. The protein separation behaviors of two alternative expression host extracts (corn germ and E. coli) were characterized. A multivariate random forest (MVRF) statistical methodology was then applied to the database of characterized proteins creating a tool for predicting the AEX behavior of a mixture of proteins. The accuracy of the MVRF method was determined by calculating a root mean squared error value for each database. This measure never exceeded a value of 0.045 (fraction of protein populating each of the multiple separation fractions) for AEX. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Here, we report the maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) gene was able to confer drought tolerance and increase grain yield in transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants. The improved of drought tolerance was associated with higher levels of proline, soluble sugar, soluble protein, and higher water use efficiency. The transgenic wheat plants had also a more extensive root system as well as increased photosynthetic capacity during stress treatments. The increased grain yield of the transgenic wheat was contributed by improved biomass, larger spike and grain numbers, and heavier 1000-grain weight under drought-stress conditions. Under non-stressed conditions, there were no significant increases in these of the measured traits except for photosynthetic rate when compared with parental wheat. Proteomic research showed that the expression levels of some proteins, including chlorophyll A-B binding protein and pyruvate, phosphate dikinase, which are related to photosynthesis, PAP fibrillin, which is involved in cytoskeleton synthesis, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, which catalyzes methionine synthesis, were induced in the transgenic wheat under drought stress.

27491813,"Fusarium head blight is one of the most important cereal diseases worldwide. Cereals differ in terms of the main occurring Fusarium species and the infection is influenced by various factors, such as weather and cropping measures. Little is known about Fusarium species in barley in Switzerland, hence harvest samples from growers were collected in 2013 and 2014, along with information on respective cropping factors. The incidence of different Fusarium species was obtained by using a seed health test and mycotoxins were quantified by LC-MS/MS. With these techniques, the most dominant species, F. graminearum, and the most prominent mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol (DON), were identified. Between the three main Swiss cropping systems, Organic, Extenso and Proof of ecological performance, we observed differences with the lowest incidence and toxin accumulation in organically cultivated barley. Hence, we hypothesise that this finding was based on an array of growing techniques within a given cropping system. We observed that barley samples from fields with maize as previous crop had a substantially higher F. graminearum incidence and elevated DON accumulation compared with other previous crops. Furthermore, the use of reduced tillage led to a higher disease incidence and toxin content compared with samples from ploughed fields.

A fluorescent reagent [5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl)aminofluorescein] was dispersed in aqueous normal maize or wheat starch slurries (35%, w/v) for 0, 5, 10, 30, or 60min, after which reaction was initiated by increasing the pH to 11.5 and allowing reaction to proceed for 3h. With increasing lengths of infiltration, the reaction became increasingly homogeneous within the granule interior (matrix) and the AM:AP reactivity ratio increased (wheat starch), as assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and size-exclusion chromatography (refractive index and fluorescence detection), respectively. A longer reagent infiltration time also led to a more inhibited (i.e., cross-linked) pasting viscosity, suggesting that both granular and/or molecular reaction patterns were altered by varied reagent infiltration times to ultimately impact modified starch properties.",Carbohydrate polymers,"['D007202', 'D007700', 'D009824', 'D013213', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Indicators and Reagents', 'Kinetics', 'Ointments', 'Starch', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Impact of reagent infiltration time on reaction patterns and pasting properties of modified maize and wheat starches.,"['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27474633,2018
27453985,"Immunoreagents with good results in the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are often unable to provide the required detection limit in the traditional competitive immunochromatographic assay. The solution may be either the production of new reagents or improving the test strip. In the latter case, the assay is often performed stepwise using additional liquid reagents, but this is a significant drawback for practical use. We introduce a test strip made as a dry chemical device that still provides the two-step immunochemical interactions - formation of a complex of specific antibodies with an antigen and its detection by a conjugate of antispecies antibodies with a nano-sized label. Analysis with this test strip is similar to that with ordinary test strips and requires no additional reagents and manipulation. The use of specific antibodies and marker as two separate components allows to improve the analytical parameters. The new test significantly lowers the limit of detection, making it possible to use antibodies previously ineffective in immunochromatography. The proposed approach was tested by determining zearalenone and aflatoxin B1 mycotoxins. The visual limit of detection for aflatoxin B1 decreased to 0.6ng/mL compared to 11ng/mL with an ordinary test strip. For zearalenone, a test strip was created with visual detection limit of 6ng/mL with reagents inefficient in the traditional test strip (which is not able to detect even 9μg/mL of zearalenone). Thus, the proposed approach allows obtaining 'dry', multi-stage, immunochromatographic test strips, providing a highly sensitive detection method.

27443207,"To ensure fair competition and to protect the horse's welfare, horses have to compete on their own merits, without any unfair advantage that might follow the use of drugs. Therefore, regulatory authorities list all substances that are not allowed in competition, including most anabolic-androgenic steroids. As zero-tolerance is retained, the question arose whether the consumption of mouldy feed could lead to the excretion of steroids, due to the biotransformation of plant phytosterols to steroids. A rapid ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analytical method, previously validated according to AORC (Association of Official Racing Chemists) and EC (European Commission) guidelines, was used to measure steroids in different sample types. Multiple mouldy feed samples were tested for the presence of steroids. The effect of digestion was tested by in vitro simulation of the horse's hindgut in batch incubations. In most feed samples no steroids were detected, even when the products were mouldy. Mouldy corn however showed to contain up to 3.0 ± 0.4 µg/kg AED (4-androstenedione), the main testosterone precursor. This concentration increased when mouldy corn (with added phytosterols) was digested in vitro. An herbal phytosupplement also showed to contain α-testosterone. These results demonstrate that it is important to caution against the consumption of any feed or (herbal) supplement of which the detailed ingredients and quantitative analysis are unknown. The consumption of mouldy corn should especially be avoided, not only from a horse health and welfare point of view, but also to avoid possible inadvertent positive doping results.

27400505,"To investigate the Terahertz's application prospect, corn, wheat husk and reed were used to detect their Terahertz Time Domain Spectroscopy, and be compared with that of cellulose powder. The experimental results show that all of their absorption peaks exist at 1.75, 1.62, 1.1, and 0.7 THz. Absorption intensity of cellulose powder, corn, wheat husk and reed were compared in some frequencies points. It finds that corn, wheat husk and reed have higher absorption intensity than cellulose powder in early frequency domain. However, absorption intensity of cellulose powder is the strongest at 1.62 THz. Cellulose content in corn, wheat husk and reed were detected by using the method of chemical analysis. The peaks of absorption coefficient are related to their cellulose content at this frequency. It shows that plant cellulose occur lattice vibration in the frequency. Deformation, bending, flexing, and other changes appear to their functional keys. Quantum chemical calculation was carried out by using density functional theory to cellulose and the structure diagram of cellulose molecular formula was obtained. It also finds some absorption peaks exist at 0.7, 1.1, and 1.75 THz. Characterization of cellulose clusters mainly includes CH2, OH, CH, and so on. Glucose hydroxyl radical on the ring is active in the cellulose chain. Where hydroxyl related chemical reaction can occur, Hydroxyl can also be integrated into the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bond. Terahertz wave can promote hydrogen bond vibration. This kind of vibration is weak in the intermolecular interaction. The vibration and rotating happen in dipole transition. The crystal lattice rotates and is absorptive in low frequency, and large molecular skeleton vibrates. All of them can show different intensity and position of the absorption peak in the terahertz band. Corn and cellulose were analyzed by infrared spectrum. The reverse and vibration mode of cellulose was discussed. The absorption peak is basically in line with its theoretical calculating result.

The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that environmental pollution by AAs and root uptake of AAs in the polluted soil may be one of the pathways by which AAs enter the human food chain. The hypothesis driving this study was that the decay of Aristolochia clematitis L., a AA-containing herbaceous plant that is found growing widespread in the endemic regions, could release free AAs to the soil, which could be taken up by food crops growing nearby, thereby transferring this potent human nephrotoxin and carcinogen into their edible parts. Using the highly sensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection method, we identified and quantitated in this study for the first time AAs in corn, wheat grain, and soil samples collected from the endemic village Kutles in Serbia. Our results provide the first direct evidence that food crops and soil in the Balkans are contaminated with AAs.

One of the most used supplements is whey protein (WP); because of its popularity, it has been a target of adulteration with substitute products, such as cheaper proteins with lower biological value. To investigate this type of adulteration, this study used shotgun proteomics analyses by MS(E) (multiplexed, low- and high-collision energy, data-independent acquisition) of WP-based supplements. Seventeen WP-based supplement samples were evaluated. Chicken, maize, rice, potato, soybean, and wheat proteins were considered as probable sources of bovine whey adulteration. Collectively, 523 proteins were identified across all 16 samples and replicates, with 94% of peptides inside a normal distribution within 10ppm of maximum error. In 10 of the 16 samples analyzed, only proteins from bovine whey could be detected, while in the other samples several other protein sources were detected in high concentrations, especially soybean, wheat, and rice.

The aim of this study was to assess the contamination of three Ivoirian spices with OTA (ginger, chili, and pepper) widely consumed by the population. A total of 90 spice samples (ginger: n = 30; chili: n = 30; pepper n = 30) was taken from various sales outlets of Abidjan. OTA was quantified using an HPLC apparatus coupled with a fluorimetric detector. The chili and ginger samples were contaminated with OTA at a mean concentration of 57.48 ± 174 and 0.12 ± 0.15 μg/kg, respectively. No contamination of the pepper samples was detected. Eight (26.67 %) of the chili samples exceeded the maximum limit of 15 μg/kg established by European regulation.

In vitro bioassays resulted in the identification of two resistant phenotypes that were highly HR (Rf: 40-170, based on EC50) and moderately MR (Rf: 10-20) resistant to carbendazim. Cross resistance studies with other fungicides showed that all mutant strains tested were also resistant to other BMZs, such as benomyl and thiabendazole, but retained their parental sensitivity to fungicides belonging to other chemical groups. A point mutation at codon 6 (His6Asn) was found in the β2-tubulin gene of MR isolates while another mutation at codon 200 (Phe200Tyr) was present in one MR and one HR isolates. Interestingly, low temperatures suppressed MBC-resistance in all isolates bearing the H6N mutation. The three-dimensional homology model of the wild-type and mutants of β-tubulins were constructed, and the possible carbendazim binding site was analyzed. Studies on fitness parameters showed that the mutation(s) for resistance to BMZs did not affect the mycelial growth rate whereas adverse effects were found in sporulation and conidial germination in most of the resistant mutants. Pathogenicity tests on corn cobs revealed that mutants were less or equally aggressive to the wild-type strain but expressed their BMZ-resistance after inoculation on maize cobs treated with MBC.

Although it is hypothesized that structural complexity and abundance of these feruloylated arabinoxylan side-chains may contribute, among other factors, to resistance of plant cell walls to enzymatic degradation, quantitative profiling approaches for these structural units in plant cell wall materials have not been described yet. Here we report the development and application of a rapid and robust method enabling the quantitative comparison of feruloylated side-chain profiles in cell wall materials following mildly acidic hydrolysis, C18-solid phase extraction (SPE), reduction under aprotic conditions, and liquid chromatography with diode-array detection/mass spectrometry (LC-DAD/MS) separation and detection. The method was applied to the insoluble fiber/cell wall materials isolated from 12 whole grains: wild rice (Zizania aquatica L.), long-grain brown rice (Oryza sativa L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), kamut (Triticum turanicum Jakubz.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), spelt (Triticum spelta L.), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), maize (Zea mays L.), popcorn (Zea mays L. var. everta), oat (Avena sativa L.)

Conventional resistance breeding strategies are hindered by the absence of tractable genetic resistance in any crop host. Understanding the biology and pathogenicity mechanisms of this fungus is important for addressing these disease issues, however, little is known about howR. solanicauses disease. This study capitalizes on recent genomic studies by applying mass spectrometry based proteomics to identify soluble, membrane-bound and culture filtrate proteins produced under wheat infection and vegetative growth conditions. Many of the proteins found in the culture filtrate had predicted functions relating to modification of the plant cell wall, a major activity required for pathogenesis on the plant host, including a number found only under infection conditions. Other infection related proteins included a high proportion of proteins with redox associated functions and many novel proteins without functional classification.

26740158,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the human exposure of individuals from Pirassununga, Brazil, to dietary aflatoxins B1 (AFB1) and M1 (AFM1) by determination of serum AFB1-lysine and urinary aflatoxin biomarkers (AFM1 and AFB1-N(7)-guanine). The participants were recruited among employees from a Campus of the University of São Paulo, which provided food samples from their homes, as well as serum and urine samples four times every three months, from June 2011 until March 2012. The probable daily intake (PDI) of aflatoxin was estimated by using the results from analysis of food products collected by the time of samples collection, and data from a 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire. Analyses of AFB1 and AFM1 in food samples were conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Biomarkers in serum and urine were determined by tandem mass spectrometry. AFB1 and AFM1 were detected in 38 samples of cereals (28%, N=136) and 31 milk products (36%, N=86), respectively. AFB1-lysine and AFB1-N(7)-guanine and were not detected in serum or urine samples, respectively. However, AFM1 was found in 74 urine samples (65%), at mean levels in the 4 sampling times ranging from 0.37±0.23 to 1.70±2.88pg/mg creatinine. The mean PDI varied among different sampling times, ranging from 0.09±0.09 to 1.35±5.98ng/kg body weight/day. A modest though significant correlation (r=0.45; p=0.03; N=23) was found for the first time in Brazil between the AFM1 concentration in urine and the PDI for total aflatoxins (AFB1+AFM1) in sampling 1 (June 2011). Urinary AFM1 was confirmed as very sensitive for monitoring the human exposure to dietary aflatoxin. Further studies using serum and urinary biomarkers are needed to estimate the aflatoxin exposure of populations in higher risk areas in Brazil.

In this work, we describe a homologous and high-throughput multi-wavelength fluorescence polarization immunoassay (MWFPIA) for the multiplexed detection of mycotoxins. Three typical Fusarium mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON), T-2 toxin and fumonisin B1 (FB1), were labeled with different dyes. Tracers and specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were employed in the MWFPIA to simultaneously detect the three mycotoxins. Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection using MWFPIA were 242.0 μg kg(-1) for DON, 17.8 μg kg(-1) for T-2 toxin and 331.5 μg kg(-1) for FB1, providing sufficient sensitivity to meet the action levels of these three contaminants in maize as set by the European Union. The use of a methanol/water (2:3, v/v) mixture for sample pretreatment allowed recoveries ranging from 76.5-106.3%, with coefficients of variation less than 21.7%. The total time of analysis, including sample preparation, was less than 30 min. Twenty naturally contaminated maize samples were tested using MWFPIA and HPLC-MS/MS, with correlation coefficients (R(2)) of 0.97 for DON and 0.99 for FB1.

Two different temperature sets were applied during extrusion: 80 °C, 90 °C, 100 °C and 130 °C and 80 °C, 100 °C, 130 °C and 160 °C. Screw speed and feed rate were kept constant at 225 rpm and 36 ± 1 g min(-1), respectively. The feed moisture content was adjusted to 30 ± 1% by mixing the tomato pulp to the corn grit. Antioxidant activity and the total phenolic content decreased after the extrusion process. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis indicated that the lycopene content decreased after the extrusion process when feed and extrudates were compared. In vitro bioaccessibility of lycopene for the extruded samples with 160 °C last zone treatment temperature was higher than the feed and extruded samples with 130 °C last zone treatment temperature.

26653462,"Ion suppression/enhancement caused by matrix effects continues being a major concern in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This research explores the ability of a supramolecular solvent (SUPRAS) made up of inverted hexagonal aggregates of oleic acid to behave as a liquid with restricted access properties (SUPRAS-RAM). Fusarium toxins in cereals were extracted with the oleic acid-based SUPRAS-RAM prior to their quantification by LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-ion trap-MS (LC-ESI-IT-MS) in order to investigate the capability of this solvent to remove or reduce ionization suppression and/or enhancement in the analysis of complex samples by MS. The method involved the vortex-shaking of 300 mg of cereal with 600 μL of the SUPRAS-RAM for 15 min, centrifugation for separation of the supernatant and quantitation by LC-ESI-IT-MS. Macromolecules such as proteins and carbohydrates were excluded from extraction by chemical and physical mechanisms. Extraction of analytes and sample clean-up were thus carried out in a single step. No evaporation of the extracts was needed. Method detection limits for the legislated Fusarium toxins [i.e. deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisins B1 (FB1) and B2 (FB2)] were 15 μg kg(-1) for DON and ZEA and 8 μg kg(-1) for fumonisins. These values were far below the maximum levels set by the European Commission for these toxins in foodstuffs. The method was successfully applied to the determination of these toxins in wheat and maize harvested in the South of Spain. No contamination of Fusarium toxins was found in samples at detectable levels. Recoveries in spiked samples were in the range 87-105%, with relative standard deviations between 1 and 7%.

26500631,"Aflatoxigenic Aspergillus fungi and associated aflatoxins are ubiquitous in the production and storage of food/feed commodities. Controlling these microbes is a challenge. In this study, the Shewanella algae strain YM8 was found to produce volatiles that have strong antifungal activity against Aspergillus pathogens. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry profiling revealed 15 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from YM8, of which dimethyl trisulfide was the most abundant. We obtained authentic reference standards for six of the VOCs; these all significantly reduced mycelial growth and conidial germination in Aspergillus; dimethyl trisulfide and 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-phenol showed the strongest inhibitory activity. YM8 completely inhibited Aspergillus growth and aflatoxin biosynthesis in maize and peanut samples stored at different water activity levels, and scanning electron microscopy revealed severely damaged conidia and a complete lack of mycelium development and conidiogenesis. YM8 also completely inhibited the growth of eight other agronomically important species of phytopathogenic fungi: A. parasiticus, A. niger, Alternaria alternate, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium oxysporum, Monilinia fructicola, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. This study demonstrates the susceptibility of Aspergillus and other fungi to VOCs from marine bacteria and indicates a new strategy for effectively controlling these pathogens and the associated mycotoxin production during storage and possibly in the field.

26483187,"Engineered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are implemented in food contact materials due to their powerful antimicrobial properties and so may enter the human food chain. Hence, it is desirable to develop easy, sensitive and fast analytical screening methods for the determination of AgNPs in complex biological matrices. This study describes such a method using solid sampling high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). A recently reported novel evaluation strategy uses the atomization delay of the respective GFAAS signal as significant indicator for AgNPs and thereby allows discrimination of AgNPs from ionic silver (Ag(+)) in the samples without elaborate sample pre-treatment. This approach was further developed and applied to a variety of biological samples. Its suitability was approved by investigation of eight different food samples (parsley, apple, pepper, cheese, onion, pasta, maize meal and wheat flour) spiked with ionic silver or AgNPs. Furthermore, the migration of AgNPs from silver-impregnated polypropylene food storage boxes to fresh pepper was observed and a mussel sample obtained from a laboratory exposure study with silver was investigated. The differences in the atomization delays (Δt(ad)) between silver ions and 20-nm AgNPs vary in a range from -2.01 ± 1.38 s for maize meal to +2.06 ± 1.08 s for mussel tissue. However, the differences were significant in all investigated matrices and so indicative of the presence/absence of AgNPs. Moreover, investigation of model matrices (cellulose, gelatine and water) gives the first indication of matrix-dependent trends.

26482059,"Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a class of naturally occurring compounds produced by many flowering plants around the World. Their presence as contaminants in food systems has become a significant concern in recent years. For example, PAs are often found as contaminants in honey through pollen transfer. A validated method was developed for the quantification of four pyrrolizidine alkaloids and one pyrrolizidine alkaloid N-oxide in plants and honey grown and produced in British Columbia. The method was optimised for extraction efficiency from the plant materials and then subjected to a single-laboratory validation to assess repeatability, accuracy, selectivity, LOD, LOQ and method linearity. The PA content in plants ranged from1.0 to 307.8 µg/g with repeatability precision between 3.8 and 20.8% RSD. HorRat values were within acceptable limits and ranged from 0.62 to 1.63 for plant material and 0.56-1.82 for honey samples. Method accuracy was determined through spike studies with recoveries ranging from 84.6 to 108.2% from the raw material negative control and from 82.1-106.0 % for the pyrrolizidine alkaloids in corn syrup. Based on the findings in this single-laboratory validation, this method is suitable for the quantitation of lycopsamine, senecionine, senecionine N-oxide, heliosupine and echimidine in common comfrey (Symphytum officinale), tansy ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), blueweed (Echium vulgare) and hound's tongue (Cynoglossum officinale) and for PA quantitation in honey and found that PA contaminants were present at low levels in BC honey.","Food additives & contaminants.

26404372,"The trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is a contaminant of crops worldwide and known to cause adverse health effects in exposed animals and humans. A small survey reported the presence of DON in maize samples in Bangladesh, but these data are insufficient to assess human exposure, and also, biomonitoring data are still scarce. The present study applied biomarker analysis to investigate the DON exposure of pregnant women in Bangladesh. Urine samples were collected from pregnant women living in a rural (n = 32) and in a suburban (n = 22) area of the country. Urines were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis of glucuronic acid conjugates and to immunoaffinity column clean-up prior to LC-MS/MS analysis of DON and its de-epoxy metabolite DOM-1. The limits of detection (LOD) for DON and DOM-1 in urine were 0.16 ng/mL and 0.10 ng/mL, respectively. DOM-1 was not detected in any of the urines, whilst DON was detectable in 52% of the samples at levels ranging from 0.18-7.16 ng/mL and a mean DON concentration of 0.86 ± 1.57 ng/mL or 2.14 ± 4.74 ng/mg creatinine. A significant difference in mean urinary DON levels was found between the rural (0.47 ± 0.73 ng/mL) and suburban (1.44 ± 2.20 ng/mL) cohort, which may be related to different food habits in the two cohorts. Analysis of food consumption data for the participants did not show significant correlations between their intake of typical staple foods and DON levels in urine. The biomarker concentrations found and published urinary excretion rates for DON were used to estimate daily mycotoxin intake in the cohort: the mean DON intake was 0.05 µg/kg b.w., and the maximum intake was 0.46 µg/kg b.w., values lower than the tolerable daily intake of 1 µg/kg b.w. These first results indicate a low dietary exposure of pregnant women in Bangladesh to DON. Nonetheless, further biomonitoring studies in children and in adult cohorts from other parts of the country are of interest to gain more insight into DON exposure in the population of Bangladesh.

26065425,"A critical assessment of three previously published indirect methods based on acidic hydrolysis using superacids for the determination of ""free"" and ""total"" deoxynivalenol (DON) was carried out. The modified mycotoxins DON-3-glucoside (D3G), 3-acetyl-DON (3ADON), and 15-acetyl-DON (15ADON) were chosen as model analytes. The initial experiments focused on the stability/degradation of DON under hydrolytic conditions and the ability to release DON from the modified forms. Acidic conditions that were capable of cleaving D3G, 3ADON, and 15ADON to DON were not found, raising doubts over the efficacy of previously published indirect methods for total DON determination. Validation of these indirect methods for wheat, maize, and barley using UHPLC-MS/MS was performed in order to test the accuracy of the generated results. Validation data for DON, D3G, 3ADON, and 15ADON in nonhydrolyzed and hydrolyzed matrices were obtained. Under the tested conditions, DON was not released from D3G, 3ADON, or 15ADON after hydrolysis and thus none of the published methods were able to cleave the modified forms of DON. In addition to acids, alkaline hydrolysis with KOH for an extended time and at elevated temperatures was also tested. 3ADON and 15ADON were cleaved under the alkaline pH caused by the addition of KOH or aqueous K2CO3 to ""neutralize"" the acidic sample extracts in the published studies.

By combining pairs of columns it was demonstrated that specific clean-up can be achieved as required for different matrices. Samples of rye flour, maize, breakfast cereal and wholemeal bread were analysed for mycotoxins regulated in the EU, by spiking at levels close to EU limits for adult and infant foods.

Herein, a portable immunosensor based on chromatographic time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay was developed for sensitive and on-site determination of aflatoxin B1 in food and feed samples. Chromatographic time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay offered a magnified positive signal and low signal-to-noise ratio in time-resolved mode due to the absence of noise interference caused by excitation light sources. Compared with the immunosensing performance in previous studies, this platform demonstrated a wider dynamic range of 0.2-60 μg/kg, lower limit of detection from 0.06 to 0.12 µg/kg, and considerable recovery from 80.5% to 116.7% for different food and feed sample matrices. It was found to be little cross-reactivity with other aflatoxins (B2, G1, G2, and M1). In the case of determination of aflatoxin B1 in peanuts, corn, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and mouse feed, excellent agreement was found when compared with aflatoxin B1 determination via the conversational high-performance liquid chromatography method.

25849036,"A dose-response study was carried out to examine the carryover of zearalenone (ZEN), deoxynivalenol (DON) and their metabolites into bovine milk. Therefore, a feeding trial with 30 dairy cows fed with three different levels of Fusarium (FUS) toxin-contaminated maize was performed. A control group (0.02 mg ZEN kg(-1) dry matter (DM) and 0.07 DON kg(-1) DM) was compared with two groups fed contaminated diets. The first diet contained 0.33 mg ZEN kg(-1) DM and 2.62 mg DON kg(-1) DM (group FUS-50) and the second diet contained 0.66 mg ZEN kg(-1) DM and 5.24 mg DON kg(-1) DM (group FUS-100). For milk sample analysis, a new cost-efficient sample preparation method was developed for the simultaneous determination of ZEN, DON and their metabolites. The method comprised the separation of the milk fat followed by an SPE clean-up on Oasis HLB and a LC-MS/MS measurement. The less toxic metabolite de-epoxy-DON had the highest detected concentration (5.6 ng ml(-1) milk) in the milk samples obtained from the feeding trial. Additionally, ZEN (up to 0.29 ng ml(-1)), α-zearalenol (up to 0.17 ng ml(-1)), β-zearalenol (up to 0.95 ng ml(-1)) and DON (up to 2.5 ng ml(-1)) were detected in these samples. The milk toxin concentrations of cows fed the control diet were significantly lower compared with cows fed the contaminated diet. The calculated carryover rates ranged between 0 and 0.0075 for ZEN and metabolites and between 0 and 0.0017 for DON independent of exposure. It can be concluded that dietary toxin concentrations in the feed below or close to the current guidance values do not pose a risk for consumers due to negligible carryover rates.","Food additives & contaminants.

25793414,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) are mycotoxins produced by fungi of the genus Fusarium which frequently contaminate maize and grain cereals. Mycotoxin-contaminated feed endangers animal health and leads to economic losses in animal production. Several mycotoxin elimination strategies, including the use of commercially available DON and ZEN detoxifying agents, have been developed. However, frequently there is no scientific proof of the efficacy of such adsorbents and degrading products. We therefore tested 20 commercially available products claiming to detoxify DON and/or ZEN either by biodegradation (4 products) or a combination of degradation and adsorption (16 products) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at approx. pH 7. Under the applied conditions, a complete reduction of DON and consequent formation of the known non-toxic metabolite DOM-1 was exclusively observed in samples taken from the anaerobic degradation experiment of one product. For all other products, incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, a maximum DON reduction of 17% after 72 h of incubation was detected. Aerobic and anaerobic incubation of only one tested product resulted in complete ZEN reduction as well as in the formation of the less-toxic metabolites DHZEN and HZEN. With this product, 68-97% of the toxin was metabolised within 3 h. After 24 h, a ZEN reduction ≥ 60% was obtained with four additional products during aerobic incubation only. Six of the 20 investigated products produced α- and/or β-ZEL, which are metabolites showing similar oestrogenic activity compared to ZEN. Aerobic and anaerobic degradation to unknown metabolites with unidentified toxicity was obtained with 10 and 3 products, respectively.

One of them has been identified as FA1 synthesized by the acetylation of fumonisin B1 (FB1), and established a method for its quantification. Herein, we identified the two remaining compounds as FA2 and FA3, which were acetylated fumonisin B2 (FB2) and fumonisin B3 (FB3), respectively. Moreover, we examined a method for the simultaneous analysis of FA1, FA2, FA3, FB1, FB2, and FB3. The corn samples were prepared by extraction using a QuEChERS kit and purification using a multifunctional cartridge. The linearity, recovery, repeatability, limit of detection, and limit of quantification of the method were >0.99, 82.9%-104.6%, 3.7%-9.5%, 0.02-0.60 μg/kg, and 0.05-1.98 μg/kg, respectively. The simultaneous analysis of the six fumonisins revealed that FA1, FA2, and FA3 were present in all corn samples contaminated with FB1, FB2, and FB3. The results suggested that corn marketed for consumption can be considered as being contaminated with both the fumonisin B-series and with fumonisin A-series.

25667313,"Tricin was recently discovered in lignin preparations from wheat (Triticum aestivum) straw and subsequently in all monocot samples examined. To provide proof that tricin is involved in lignification and establish the mechanism by which it incorporates into the lignin polymer, the 4'-O-β-coupling products of tricin with the monolignols (p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols) were synthesized along with the trimer that would result from its 4'-O-β-coupling with sinapyl alcohol and then coniferyl alcohol. Tricin was also found to cross couple with monolignols to form tricin-(4'-O-β)-linked dimers in biomimetic oxidations using peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide or silver (I) oxide. Nuclear magnetic resonance characterization of gel permeation chromatography-fractionated acetylated maize (Zea mays) lignin revealed that the tricin moieties are found in even the highest molecular weight fractions, ether linked to lignin units, demonstrating that tricin is indeed incorporated into the lignin polymer. These findings suggest that tricin is fully compatible with lignification reactions, is an authentic lignin monomer, and, because it can only start a lignin chain, functions as a nucleation site for lignification in monocots. This initiation role helps resolve a long-standing dilemma that monocot lignin chains do not appear to be initiated by monolignol homodehydrodimerization as they are in dicots that have similar syringyl-guaiacyl compositions. The term flavonolignin is recommended for the racemic oligomers and polymers of monolignols that start from tricin (or incorporate other flavonoids) in the cell wall, in analogy with the existing term flavonolignan that is used for the low-molecular mass compounds composed of flavonoid and lignan moieties.

25558774,"The metabolism of zearalenone (ZEA) and analytical methods for determining the presence of ZEA and its metabolites are discussed in this study. Similar to phytoestrogens, solid metaloestrogens, pharmaceuticals, and selected pesticides, ZEA is a substance that displays endocrine activity. ZEA is accumulated in living organisms, and it is capable of contaminating all trophic levels of the food chain, from grain, maize, and other crop plants to human consumers. Zearalenone has a structure similar to that of estrogen (the presence of a macrocyclic lactone ring), it has an affinity for estrogen receptors, and it competes with 17β-estradiol for binding the estrogen receptor in natural pathways. As endocrine disruptors, zearalenone and its metabolites can also contribute to carcinogenic mutations associated with female secondary sex characteristics. The determination of zearalenone and its metabolites in various matrices, first of all biological and environmental samples, poses significant problems. A variety ways of extracting and purifying zearalenone, including liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction, are described.

25537174,"Single-hole hollow molecularly imprinted microspheres (h-MIMs) were prepared by hard template method and applied to extract six triazine pesticides in cereal samples, followed by HPLC-MS/MS detection. The synthesis mechanism of the h-MIMs has been studied. The h-MIMs exhibited bigger specific surface area and much higher binding capacity than the molecularly imprinted polymers prepared by precipitation polymerization (p-MIPs) and surface polymerization (s-MIPs). Besides, the adsorption rate of h-MIMs to prometryn was significantly higher than that of p-MIPs and s-MIPs. Owing to the hollow structure of the h-MIMs, more binding cavities were located on the inner and outer surfaces of the h-MIMs, which could facilitate the removal of template molecules from the polymers and the rebinding of the target molecules to the polymers.

25437164,"The aim of this study is a current trend in chemical food safety control to increase monitoring of the co-occurrence of mycotoxins. Unsanitary conditions during harvesting, drying, packing and storage in production and processing of cereals can effect mycotoxin contamination. A method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 11 mycotoxins: deoxynivalenol, aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2, ochratoxin A, fumonisins B1 and B2, zearalenone, and toxins T-2 and HT-2, allowing confirmation of their presence in maize samples as well as their identification and semi-quantification. The mycotoxins are extracted with a mixture of methanol/water, diluted with water and 0.1% formic acid and then analyzed by LC-HESI-MS/MS in a single 12 min run in positive mode. Multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) is applied by using two abundant fragments for each mycotoxin. Matrix effects are compensated using external matrix-matched calibration curves. Recoveries, calculated by spiking blank maize samples, ranging from 95.2% to 113.4%, were in accordance with the performance criteria required by the European Commission and intraday reproducibility ranged from 4.2% to 13.2%. Proficiency test materials and reference materials were analyzed to assess the accuracy of the method with satisfying results for the 11 mycotoxins.

We surveyed food intake and estimated the risk of exposures to aflatoxin and fumonisin mycotoxins for infants less than 6 months of age in Northern Tanzania. A total of 143 infants were progressively recruited and three follow-up visits were made at 1, 3 and 5 months of age. A 24-h dietary recall technique was used to estimate flour intake of infants who had been introduced to maize foods. Aflatoxins and fumonisins in the flours were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography technique. Exposure to aflatoxins or fumonisins was estimated using the deterministic approach. By the age of 3 months, 98 infants had started taking food; 67 of them, maize flours at levels ranging from 0.57 to 37.50 g per infant per day (average 8 g per infant per day). Fifty-eight per cent of 67 maize flour samples contained detectable aflatoxins (range 0.33-69.47 μg kg(-1) ; median 6 μg kg(-1) ) and 31% contained detectable fumonisins (range 48-1224 μg kg(-1) ; median 124 μg kg(-1) ). For infants who consumed contaminated flours, aflatoxin exposure ranged from 0.14 to 120 ng kg(-1) body weight (BW) per day (all above the health concern level of 0.017 ng kg(-1) BW per day as recommended by the European Food Safety Agency) and fumonisin exposure ranged from 0.005 to 0.88 μg kg(-1) BW per day.

STC is a precursor of the carcinogen aflatoxin B1 and exerts carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic effects. A reliable GC-MS-based analytical method using on-column injection was developed and validated to determine STC content in grain. In this method, STC was extracted with acetonitrile (84%), and the filtered extract was diluted with phosphate buffer before immunoaffinity column (IAC) cleanup. After elution and N2 evaporation, the sample containing STC was dissolved in acetone and injected into the GC-MS system without derivatization. Separation of STC was carried out by a capillary column (0.25 mm i.d.×30 m, 0.25 μm) with a deactivated pre-column (0.53 mm i.d.×0.6 m). The matrix effect was investigated in maize, wheat, and rice, and an insignificant matrix effect was observed after IAC cleanup. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 20-300 pg (equivalent to 8-120 μg/kg in grain) with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.999, and the relative standard deviation of repeatability (RSDr) was less than 10 %. The limit of detection (LOD) of the method was 6 pg (equivalent to 2.4 μg/kg in grain), and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 20 pg (equivalent to 8 μg/kg).

25386674,"The presence of abundant storage proteins in plant embryos greatly impedes seed proteomics analysis. Vicilin (or globulin-1) is the most abundant storage protein in maize embryo. There is a need to deplete the vicilins from maize embryo extracts for enhanced proteomics analysis. We here reported a chloroform-assisted phenol extraction (CAPE) method for vicilin depletion. By CAPE, maize embryo proteins were first extracted in an aqueous buffer, denatured by chloroform and then subjected to phenol extraction. We found that CAPE can effectively deplete the vicilins from maize embryo extract, allowing the detection of low-abundance proteins that were masked by vicilins in 2-DE gel. The novelty of CAPE is that it selectively depletes abundant storage proteins from embryo extracts of both monocot (maize) and dicot (soybean and pea) seeds, whereas other embryo proteins were not depleted. CAPE can significantly improve proteome profiling of embryos and extends the application of chloroform and phenol extraction in plant proteomics.

Essential oil (EO) of oregano variety Mendocino (OMen), Cordobes (OCor), and Compacto (OCom), mint variety Inglesa (Mi), and Pehaujo (Mp), Suico (Sui); rosemary (Ro), and Aguaribay (Ag) were tested in vitro against 4 corn fungi: A. flavus (CCC116-83 and BXC01), P. oxalicum (083296), and P. minioluteum (BXC03). The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined. The chemical profiles of the EOs were analyzed by GC-MS. Lipid oxidation in cell membrane of fungi was determined by hydroperoxides and related with essential oil antifungal activity. The major compounds were Thymol in OCor (18.66%), Omen (12.18%), and OCom (9.44%); menthol in Mi and Mp; verbenone in Sui; dehydroxy-isocalamendiol in Ag; and eucaliptol in Ro. OCor, Omen, and OCom showed the best antifungal activity. No antifungal activity was observed in Ag and Ro EO. The hydroperoxide value depended on the fungi (P < 0.001) and the antimicrobial agent (P < 0.001).Membrane lipids were oxidized by Sui EO in A. flavus BXC01 and A. flavus CCC116-83 (0.021 and 0.027 meqO2 /kg, respectively).

After 1, 3, 8, 15, 22 and 29 days, four piglets per group were slaughtered. The simultaneous determination of all analytes was carried out using a sensitive and selective in-house-validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method after sample preparation with Oasis™ HLB columns. ZEN, α-ZEL, DON and de-DON were detected in serum, whereas in liquor only ZEN, DON and de-DON were found at lower concentrations. In urine, all analytes were detected in considerably higher concentrations as in serum and liquor, whereby α- and β-ZAL could only be detected sporadically. Apart from ZEN in liquor and α- and β-ZAL in urine, the mycotoxin concentrations increased with increasing concentrations of Fusarium toxins in the diet. The toxin intake per kg body weight 3-4 h prior to slaughtering correlated well with the DON and the sum of DON and de-DON concentrations in all three specimens as well as with the ZEN, α-ZEL and the sum of ZEN and metabolite concentrations in urine. Due to the high correlation between the dietary DON concentration and the DON (r = 0.855) and the sum of DON and de-DON (r = 0.870) concentration in serum, the exposure to DON can be evaluated. Moreover, serum levels of these toxins indicative of an exceeding of the guidance value in feed can be established using the corresponding regression equations. Strictly speaking, these relationships are only valid for the experimental conditions of the underlying experiment.

With 47.4% higher and 26.3% positive mutation rates were obtained, the ARTP jet exhibited a strong effect on mutation breeding of S. cerevisiae. The mutant S. cerevisiae S12 exhibited the lowest methanol content, which was decreased by 72.54% compared with that of the wild-type strain. Subsequently, the mutant S. cerevisiae S12 was used to ferment different combinations of malt and adjuncts for lower methanol content and higher alcoholic content.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the ECB feeding activity could also affect the occurrence of emerging mycotoxins in maize kernels. During the 2008-10 period, natural infestation of the insect was compared, in field research, with the protection of infestation, which was obtained by using an entomological net. The ears collected in the protected plots were free from ECB attack, while those subject to natural insect attacks showed a damage severity that varied from 10% to 25%. The maize samples were analysed by means of an LC-MS/MS-based multi-mycotoxin method, which led to the detection of various metabolites: fumonisins (FUMs), fusaproliferin (FUS), moniliformin (MON), bikaverin (BIK), beauvericin (BEA), fusaric acid (FA), equisetin (EQU), deoxynivalenol (DON), deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (DON-3-G), zearalenone (ZEA), culmorin (CULM), aurofusarin (AUR) and butenolide (BUT).

In Mesoamerica, pulque, an alcoholic beverage produced from the fermented sap of several species of maguey plants (Agavaceae; Fig. 1) is hypothesized to have been used as a dietary supplement and risk-buffering food in ancient Teotihuacan (150 B.C. to A.D. 650). Although direct archaeological evidence of pulque production is lacking, organic residue analysis of pottery vessels offers a new avenue of investigation. However, the chemical components of alcoholic beverages are water-soluble, greatly limiting their survival over archaeological timescales compared with hydrophobic lipids widely preserved in food residues. Hence, we apply a novel lipid biomarker approach that considers detection of bacteriohopanoids derived from the ethanol-producing bacterium Zymomonas mobilis for identifying pulque production/consumption in pottery vessels. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry selected ion monitoring (m/z 191) of lipid extracts of >300 potsherds revealed characteristic bacteriohopanoid distributions in a subset of 14 potsherds. This hopanoid biomarker approach offers a new means of identifying commonly occurring bacterially fermented alcoholic beverages worldwide, including palm wine, beer, cider, perry, and other plant sap- or fruit-derived beverages [Swings J, De Ley J (1977) Bacteriol Rev 41(1):1-46].

25194830,"We report an unusual aflatoxin profile in maize and groundnuts from Malawi, with aflatoxin G1 found routinely at equal or even higher levels than aflatoxin B1. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) ratio in a contaminated sample is generally greater than 50% of total aflatoxin (sum of aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, and G2). In Malawi, the aflatoxin occurrence ratios were determined by examining LC-MS/MS and HPLC fluorescence detection (FLD) data of 156 naturally contaminated raw maize and 80 groundnut samples collected in 2011 and 2012. Results showed that natural aflatoxin occurrence ratio differed. In 47% of the samples, the concentration of AFG1 was higher than that of AFB1. The mean concentration percentages of AFB1/AFB2/AFG1/AFG2 in reference to total aflatoxins were found to be 47:5:43:5%, respectively. The AFG1 and AFB1 50/50 trend was observed in maize and groundnuts and was consistent for samples collected in both years. If the AFB1 measurement was used to check compliance of total aflatoxin regulatory limit set at 10, 20, 100, and 200 μg/kg with an assumption that AFB1≥50% of the total aflatoxin content, 8, 13, 24, and 26% false negative rates would have occurred respectively.

25175039,"An LC-MS/MS ""dilute and shoot"" method for the determination of 295 fungal and bacterial metabolites was optimized and validated according to the guidelines established in the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs of the European Commission (SANCO) document No. 12495/2011. Four different types of food matrices were chosen for validation: apple puree for infants (high water content), hazelnuts (high fat content), maize (high starch and low fat content) and green pepper (difficult or unique matrix). Method accuracy and precision was evaluated using spiked samples in five replicates at two concentration levels. Method trueness was demonstrated through participation in various proficiency tests. Although the method covers a total number of 331 analytes, validation data were acquired only for 295 analytes, either due to the non-availability of analytical standards or due other reasons described in this paper. Concerning the apparent recovery, the percentage of 295 analytes matching the acceptable recovery range of 70-120% lied down by SANCO varied from 21% in green pepper to 74% in apple puree at the highest spiking level. At the levels close to limit of quantification only 20-58% of the analytes fulfilled this criterion. The extent of matrix effects was strongly dependent on the analyte/matrix combination. In general, the lowest matrix effects were observed in apple puree (59% of analytes were not influenced by enhancement/suppression at all at the highest validation level). The highest matrix effects were observed in green pepper, where only 10% of analytes did not suffer from signal suppression/enhancement. The repeatability of the method was acceptable (RSD≤20) for 97% of all analytes in apple puree and hazelnuts, for 95% in maize and for 89% in green pepper. Concerning the trueness of the method, Z-scores were generally between -2 and 2, despite a broad variety of different matrices. Based on these results it can be concluded that quantitative determination of mycotoxins by LC-MS/MS based on a ""dilute and shoot"" approach is also feasible in case of complex matrices.

However, when consumed they can cause intoxication, especially in humans. Therefore, effective quantitative methods for assessing the dietary exposure of this toxic fungal metabolite are required. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the effect on the use of a bio-wipe kit, which is a faecal material collection kit, to detect the presence of FB1. Faecal materials were collected from a rural farming community in Gauteng Province, South Africa. In total, 200 samples of faecal material were analysed for Fusarium species using a serial dilution method, while FB1 was further analysed and quantified by reversed-phase TLC and HPLC. The study showed the presence of 11 different Fusarium species grown on potato dextrose agar culture medium of which F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, producers of FB1, and F. oxysporum were the dominant species. Fumonisin B1 was recorded at an incidence rate of 65% of the total using TLC. Results from HPLC showed that 84% were positive at different ranges of concentration for FB1.

25153258,"Fumonisin A-series (FAs) in a reference material of corn sample that was naturally contaminated with fumonisins was characterized using high-resolution liquid chromatography-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitap MS). Peaks for fumonisin B1 (FB1), fumonisin B2 (FB2), and fumonisin B3 (FB3), in addition to three peaks corresponding to unknown compounds I, II, and III, were detected in the chromatogram for the corn sample. Fragment ion analysis for FB1, FB2, and FB3 showed that while the ions formed at m/z values of 200-800 were similar to those formed by the cleavage of the tricarballylic acids and the hydroxyl groups, the fragmentation patterns at m/z values of 50-200 varied depending on the hydroxyl group locations in the compounds. Fragment ion analysis of compounds I-III revealed structural similarities to FBs, only differing by an additional C2H2O in the unknown compounds. Using these results and by comparing the product ion mass spectra of compound I with fumonisin A1 (FA1) synthesized from FB1 standards, compounds I-III were hypothesized to be N-acetyl analogs of FBs: fumonisins A1 (FA1), A2 (FA2), and A3 (FA3). The method for determining concentrations was validated with FA1, FB1, FB2, and FB3 standards and applied to analyze the reference material.

To assess the exposure of Danish cattle to mycotoxins from maize silage, 99 samples of whole-crop maize (ensiled and un-ensiled) were analyzed for their contents of 27 mycotoxins and other secondary fungal metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method specifically targets the majority of common pre- and post-harvest fungi associated with maize silage in Denmark. Sixty-one samples contained one or more of the 27 analytes in detectable concentrations. The most common mycotoxins were zearalenone, enniatin B nivalenol and andrastin A, found in 34%, 28%, 16% and 15% of the samples, respectively. None of the samples contained mycotoxins above the EU recommended maximum concentrations for Fusarium toxins in cereal-based roughage. Thus, the present study does not indicate that Danish maize silage in general is a cause of acute single mycotoxin intoxications in cattle. However, 31 of the samples contained multiple analytes; two samples as much as seven different fungal metabolites. Feed rations with maize silage may therefore contain complex mixtures of fungal secondary metabolites with unknown biological activity.

These results indicate that WBC is capable of increasing fumonisin levels in maize. Under WBC infestation, Cry1F mitigated this risk more consistently than Cry1Ab or non-Bt hybrids. Transgenically expressed Bt proteins active against multiple lepidopteran pests can provide broad, consistent reductions in the risk of fumonisin contamination.

24961635,"Laser-ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) does not require very flat surfaces, high-precision sample preparation, or the addition of matrix. Because of these features, LAESI-MSI may be the method of choice for spatially-resolved food analysis. In this work, LAESI time-of-flight MSI was investigated for macroscopic and microscopic imaging of pesticides, mycotoxins, and plant metabolites on rose leaves, orange and lemon fruit, ergot bodies, cherry tomatoes, and maize kernels. Accurate mass ion-map data were acquired at sampling locations with an x-y center-to-center distance of 0.2-1.0 mm and were superimposed onto co-registered optical images. The spatially-resolved ion maps of pesticides on rose leaves suggest co-application of registered and banned pesticides. Ion maps of the fungicide imazalil reveal that this compound is only localized on the peel of citrus fruit. However, according to three-dimensional LAESI-MSI the penetration depth of imazalil into the peel has significant local variation. Ion maps of different plant alkaloids on ergot bodies from rye reveal co-localization in accordance with expectations. The feasibility of using untargeted MSI for food analysis was revealed by ion maps of plant metabolites in cherry tomatoes and maize-kernel slices. For tomatoes, traveling-wave ion mobility (TWIM) was used to discriminate between different lycoperoside glycoalkaloid isomers; for maize quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) was successfully used to elucidate the structure of a localized unknown. It is envisaged that LAESI-MSI will contribute to future research in food science, agriforensics, and plant metabolomics.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D005506', 'D007834', 'D009183', 'D021241']","['Food Contamination', 'Lasers', 'Mycotoxins', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Macroscopic and microscopic spatially-resolved analysis of food contaminants and constituents using laser-ablation electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24961635,2015

The method was based on an improved dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) followed by analysis using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Also, matrix-matched calibration curve (R(2)>0.99) was employed to minimize matrix effects and ensure accurate quantification. The recoveries during sample preparation process (including extraction and clean-up) ranged from 79.03% to 118.39%, with intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviation lower than 20% for all the analytes. The limit of quantification ranged from 5.0 μg/kg for deoxynivalenol to 13.6 μg/kg for fusarenon X. The validated method was successfully applied to the analysis of animal feed and corn. The pilot study showed that 37 out of 41 samples were contaminated with deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside at the levels of 6.0-121.0 μg/kg. Most of the type B trichothecenes were also found with the exception of fusarenon X, at the contaminated levels of 10.0-1,382 μg/kg.

The sample homogenate is subjected to clean-up using SPE, followed by analyte derivatization and ELISA detection. Accuracy, precision and linearity of the ELISA procedure have been validated using spiked samples. Analytical recovery ranged from 91.8% to 96.0% with coefficients of variation below 15%. Good linearity over a wide range of dilution and minimal assay drift was observed within a microtiter plate. IC50 value of the calibration curve was 110 ng/mL, with the limit of detection about 5 ng/mL and dynamic range from 10 to 1000 ng/mL. The high specificity of the ELISA was demonstrated by cross-reactivity study using 11 potential cross-reactants. A good correlation between the results obtained from the ELISA and GC-MS within the concentration range 120-1500 μg/kg was found in the chip samples (r=0.992, n=120).

24723378,"A method for the simultaneous analysis of 14 mycotoxins with the minimization of carryover was developed. Our verification experiments suggested that the carryover occurred due to the chelation of fumonisins with the metal. To wash the fumonisins from the metal, the inner surface of the injection needle was rinsed with 10 mM trisodium citrate and 1% formic acid in water/methanol/acetonitrile/isopropanol after each injection, and the analysis was performed on a metal-free Mastro C18 column. This approach remarkably minimized the carryover of fumonisins. Fourteen mycotoxins in samples were extracted with 2% acetic acid in water/acetonitrile and a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction kit, purified on a MultiSep 229 Ochra, and then quantified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Determinations performed using this method produced a linearity greater than 0.99 and recoveries ranging from 72.6 to 117.4%, with good intraday precision from 4.0 to 12.4%, and interday precision from 6.5 to 17.0%. The limits of detection ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 μg/kg, demonstrating that a highly sensitive method for the simultaneous analysis of mycotoxins over a wide range of concentrations was achieved with minimal carryover.

During extrusion, physiochemical properties of nixtamalized corn flour are negatively modified. The use of enzymes such as xylanase in order to obtain nixtamalized corn flour using extrusion has been studied as an alternative to reduce these changes in corn flour tortilla. The aim of this research was to evaluate changes in protein solubility of extruded nixtamalized corn flour with and without different concentrations of xylanase enzyme (0.05, 0.075, and 0.1%, w/w). Soluble proteins of each corn flour were extracted and analyzed by SE-HPLC, while insoluble proteins were determined by the combustion method. In addition, each corn flour was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the extruded nixtamalized corn flour, with and without xylanase, increased the protein solubility, and this effect was lower in extruded nixtamalized corn flour with xylanase.

This study investigates effects of accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) on anthocyanin composition and extraction efficiency from blue wheat, purple corn, and black rice in comparison with the commonly used solvent extraction (CSE). Factorial experimental design was employed to study effects of ASE and MAE variables, and anthocyanin extracts were analyzed by spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (DAD), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry chromatography. The extraction efficiency of ASE and MAE was comparable with CSE at the optimal conditions. The greatest extraction by ASE was achieved at 50 °C, 2500 psi, 10 min using 5 cycles, and 100% flush. For MAE, a combination of 70 °C, 300 W, and 10 min in MAE was the most effective in extracting anthocyanins from blue wheat and purple corn compared with 50 °C, 1200 W, and 20 min for black rice. The anthocyanin composition of grain extracts was influenced by the extraction method. The ASE extraction method seems to be more appropriate in extracting anthocyanins from the colored grains as being comparable with the CSE method based on changes in anthocyanin composition. The method caused lower structural changes in anthocaynins compared with the MAE method. Changes in blue wheat anthocyanins were lower in comparison with purple corn or black rice perhaps due to the absence of acylated anthocyanin compounds in blue wheat. The results show significant differences in anthocyanins among the 3 extraction methods, which indicate a need to standardize a method for valid comparisons among studies and for quality assurance purposes.

The affinity ligands were structural fragments of polysulfonate triazine dye Cibacron Blue 3GA (CB3GA) and represent novel lead scaffolds for designing synthetic affinity ligands. Solid phase chemistry was used to synthesize variants of CB3GA lead ligand. One immobilized ligand, bearing 4-aminobenzyl sulfonic acid (4ABS) linked on two chlorine atoms of the triazine ring (4ABS-Trz-4ABS), displayed high affinity for mAb 2G12. Absorption equilibrium, 3D molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulation studies were carried out to provide a detailed picture of the 4ABS-Trz-4ABS interaction with mAb 2G12.

24190288,"We examined whether immunochemical-based test kits designed for quantitative analysis of deoxynivalenol (DON) screening in grain crops are applicable to corn processing by-products. Commercially available test kits (two types of immunochromatographic kits and three types of ELISA kits) were used to assay three types of corn processing by-products and mixed feed. The results obtained with some kits were significantly different from those of LC-MS analysis. Since the differences might be caused by insufficient extraction of DON from samples, the extraction time of all kits was set to be 20 minutes, based on a study of the dependence of the amount of DON extracted on the shaking time. Moreover, the extract of corn processing by-products was acidic, resulting in inhibition of the antigen-antibody reaction, so neutralization and centrifugation processes were introduced to prevent denaturation of antibody. After these modifications, the recovery for all kits in assays of corn gluten meal was within the range of 80-120%, and all kits showed acceptable accuracy. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of repeatability tests for all kits was less than 11.3% for analyses of both corn processing by-products and mixed feeds, indicating good precision.

Each sample (n = 21) was analyzed for AA, DM, CP, crude fiber, crude fat, ash, NDF, ADF, trace minerals, and starch. Mean values (DM basis) were 0.88% Lys, 10.49% crude fat, 34.21% CP, and 4,722 kcal/kg GE. The standard deviations among sorghum DDGS plants were similar to those within plants for most nutrients. Results of these analyses were used to formulate diets for 2 nursery trials. The 2 experiments were conducted to determine the effects of adding sorghum DDGS (29.0% CP and 7.2% crude fat) to corn- or sorghum-based diets on nursery pig growth performance. In Exp. 1, 360 nursery barrows (6.8 kg and 26 d of age) were used in a 34-d study. Pigs were allotted to 1 of 8 dietary treatments with 5 pigs per pen and 9 pens per treatment. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 4 factorial with main effects of grain source (corn vs. sorghum) and sorghum DDGS (0, 15, 30, or 45%). Diets were formulated to 1.30 and 1.25% standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys in phases 1 and 2, respectively, but were not balanced for energy. Overall, there were no differences among pigs fed sorghum- or corn-based diets for ADG and ADFI; however, as sorghum DDGS increased from 0 to 45% of the diet, ADG decreased (linear, P < 0.01). There was a DDGS × grain source interaction (linear, P < 0.04) observed for G:F. In corn-based diets, pigs fed increasing sorghum DDGS had relatively similar G:F. However, in pigs fed sorghum-based diets, G:F was best for those fed 0% DDGS but was decreased in pigs fed 15, 30, or 45% sorghum DDGS. In Exp. 2, 180 nursery pigs (10.7 kg and 38 d of age) were used in a 21-d study with 6 pigs per pen and 5 pens per treatment. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial with main effects of grain source (corn vs. sorghum) and DDGS (0 vs. 30% corn or sorghum DDGS).

We used mass spectrometry to identify proteins from auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA)-induced rapidly growing corn (Zea mays) coleoptiles to find possible candidates controlling this growth as well as the underlying cell wall and cuticle biosynthesis. Excised sections were incubated for 4 h in the absence or presence of IAA, protein extracted, and analyzed using LC-ESI-MS/MS. Of 86 proteins identified, 15 showed a predicted association with cell wall/cuticle biosynthesis or trafficking machinery; four identifications revealed novel proteins of unknown function. In parallel, real-time PCR indicated that the steady-state mRNA levels of genes with a known or predicted role in cell-wall biosynthesis increase upon treatment with auxin. Importantly, genes encoding two of the hypothetical proteins also show higher levels of mRNA; additionally, their gene expression is down-regulated as coleoptile growth ceases and up-regulated in expanding leaves. This suggests a major role of those novel proteins in the regulation of processes related to cell and organ expansion and thus plant growth.

23985452,"Subsistence farmers are exposed to a range of mycotoxins. This study applied novel urinary multi-mycotoxin LC-MS/MS methods to determine multiple exposure biomarkers in the high oesophageal cancer region, Transkei, South Africa. Fifty-three female participants donated part of their maize-based evening meal and first void morning urine, which was analysed both with sample clean-up (single and multi-biomarker) and by a 'dilute-and-shoot' multi-biomarker method. Results were corrected for recovery with LOD for not detected. A single biomarker method detected fumonisin B1 (FB1) (87% incidence; mean±standard deviation 0.342±0.466 ng/mg creatinine) and deoxynivalenol (100%; mean 20.4±49.4 ng/mg creatinine) after hydrolysis with β-glucuronidase. The multi-biomarker 'dilute-and-shoot' method indicated deoxynivalenol-15-glucuronide was predominantly present. A multi-biomarker method with β-glucuronidase and immunoaffinity clean-up determined zearalenone (100%; 0.529±1.60 ng/mg creatinine), FB1 (96%; 1.52±2.17 ng/mg creatinine), α-zearalenol (92%; 0.614±1.91 ng/mg creatinine), deoxynivalenol (87%; 11.3±27.1 ng/mg creatinine), β-zearalenol (75%; 0.702±2.95 ng/mg creatinine) and ochratoxin A (98%; 0.041±0.086 ng/mg creatinine).

Aflatoxin production in corn from the same field due to natural infestation was also assessed. A small corn plot in Baton Rouge, La., U.S.A., was used during the 2008-growing season. Two groups of 400 plants were inoculated with 2 different inocula and 1 group of 400 plants was designated as controls. Any contamination detected in the controls was attributed to natural infestation. A subset of each group was imaged with a visible near infra red (VNIR) hyperspectral system under ultra violet (UV) excitation and subsequently analyzed for aflatoxin using affinity column fluorometry. Group differences were statistically analyzed. Results indicate that when all the spectral data across all groups were averaged, any potential differences between groups (treated and untreated) were obscured. However, spectral analysis based on contaminated ""hot"" pixel classification showed a distinct spectral shift/separation between contaminated and clean ears with fluorescence peaks at 501 and 478 nm, respectively. All inoculated and naturally infected control ears had fluorescence peaks at 501 nm that differed from uninfected corn ears.

The water activity of all samples collected during the two seasons was <0.70. The total fungal populations of the maize from different regions in the two seasons was not significantly different (p > 0.05). Fusarium verticillioides, F. proliferatum and F. subglutinans predominated in different regions in both seasons based on molecular analyses. In the 2009/10 season, the isolates of these species all produced FB1, while in the 2010/11 season, very few produced FB1. A. flavus isolates (2009/10) were recovered from mountains and Senqu river valley samples while the 2010/11 isolates were predominantly from the foothills and northern lowlands. The mountain isolates of Aspergillus section Flavi produced the highest levels of AFB1 (20 mg kg(-1)). Aspergillus parasiticus was only isolated from the foothills, Senqu river valley and southern lowlands samples, and the AFB1 levels produced ranged from 'none detected' to 3.5 mg kg(-1). The Aspergillus ochraceous isolates were least frequently encountered in both seasons. In the 2009/10 season, the isolates from the northern lowlands produced ochratoxin A (OTA) in culture. No isolates of A. niger from different regions in both seasons produced any OTA. Multi-mycotoxin analyses of the maize samples were done for a range of mycotoxins. At least one sample from each region in both seasons was FB1-positive. FB1 levels for 2010/11 samples (7-936 μg kg(-1)) were higher than in the 2009/10 season (2-3 μg kg(-1)). In both seasons, the mountains registered the highest levels of FB1. Deoxynivalenol (DON) was recovered from all the samples analysed, with the highest mean contamination of 1,469 μg kg(-1) in samples from the northern lowlands. Moniliformin (MON) was detected from all agroecological zones in the two seasons (5-320 μg kg(-1) in 2009/10; 15-1,205 μg kg(-1) in 2010/11). Emerging toxins such as fusaproliferin (FUS) and beauvericin (BEA) were also detected. OTA was not detected in any of the samples analysed.

23929733,"Rapid, precise, and globally comparable methods for monitoring greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes are required for accurate GHG inventories from different cropping systems and management practices. Manual gas sampling followed by gas chromatography (GC) is widely used for measuring GHG fluxes in agricultural fields, but is laborious and time-consuming. The photo-acoustic infrared gas monitoring system (PAS) with on-line gas sampling is an attractive option, although it has not been evaluated for measuring GHG fluxes in cereals in general and rice in particular. We compared N2 O, CO2 , and CH4 fluxes measured by GC and PAS from agricultural fields under the rice-wheat and maize-wheat systems during the wheat (winter), and maize/rice (monsoon) seasons in Haryana, India. All the PAS readings were corrected for baseline drifts over time and PAS-CH4 (PCH4 ) readings in flooded rice were corrected for water vapor interferences. The PCH4 readings in ambient air increased by 2.3 ppm for every 1000 mg cm(-3) increase in water vapor. The daily CO2 , N2 O, and CH4 fluxes measured by GC and PAS from the same chamber were not different in 93-98% of all the measurements made but the PAS exhibited greater precision for estimates of CO2 and N2 O fluxes in wheat and maize, and lower precision for CH4 flux in rice, than GC. The seasonal GC- and PAS-N2 O (PN2 O) fluxes in wheat and maize were not different but the PAS-CO2 (PCO2 ) flux in wheat was 14-39% higher than that of GC. In flooded rice, the seasonal PCH4 and PN2 O fluxes across N levels were higher than those of GC-CH4 and GC-N2 O fluxes by about 2- and 4fold, respectively. The PAS (i) proved to be a suitable alternative to GC for N2 O and CO2 flux measurements in wheat, and (ii) showed potential for obtaining accurate measurements of CH4 fluxes in flooded rice after making correction for changes in humidity.

However, there are limited data on the presence of other mycotoxins. Two multimycotoxin LC-MS/MS methods were applied to good and moldy maize samples, as separated by the farmers themselves from the 2011 harvest. One method involved extract cleanup on multitoxin immunoaffinity columns before LC-MS/MS analysis for aflatoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEN), and T-2 and HT-2 toxins. The other method was based on a ""dilute-and-shoot"" approach for the above mycotoxins and a wide range of other fungal secondary metabolites. Both methods showed high incidences of fumonisins B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2) in good maize (100% for both by the first method, means were 2083 and 927 μg/kg for the two analogues; 93% for both by the second method, positive means of 2764 and 1050 μg/kg, respectively). All samples of moldy maize were contaminated (mean FB1 of 27.64 and 35.98 mg/kg, respectively; mean FB2 of 10.58 and 14.14 mg/kg, respectively). Comparison of the two methods for FB1 and FB2 over the entire range of samples gave R(2) values 0.9144 and 0.8859, respectively. Low levels of DON were found by both methods (positive means of 12 and 4.7 μg/kg in good maize, respectively, and of 14 and 5.8 μg/kg in moldy maize, respectively).

Carbons of the glycosidic α-1,6 linkages required high hydration rates before adopting uniform chemical shifts indicating solid-state disorder and poor water accessibility. Comparative analysis of wheat and waxy maize starches demonstrated that starches were similar upon gelatinization independent of botanical origin and that the torsion angles of the glycosidic linkages were averages of the crystalline A and B type structures.

23870978,"This paper develops a rapid analysis method for adulteration identification of a popular traditional Chinese food, lotus root powder (LRP), by near-infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics. 85 pure LRP samples were collected from 7 main lotus producing areas of China to include most if not all of the significant variations likely to be encountered in unknown authentic materials. To evaluate the model specificity, 80 adulterated LRP samples prepared by blending pure LRP with different levels of four cheaper and commonly used starches were measured and predicted. For multivariate quality models, two class modeling methods, the traditional soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) and a recently proposed partial least squares class model (PLSCM) were used. Different data preprocessing techniques, including smoothing, taking derivative and standard normal variate (SNV) transformation were used to improve the classification performance. The results indicate that smoothing, taking second-order derivatives and SNV can improve the class models by enhancing signal-to-noise ratio, reducing baseline and background shifts. The most accurate and stable models were obtained with SNV spectra for both SIMCA (sensitivity 0.909 and specificity 0.938) and PLSCM (sensitivity 0.909 and specificity 0.925). Moreover, both SIMCA and PLSCM could detect LRP samples mixed with 5% (w/w) or more other cheaper starches, including cassava, sweet potato, potato and maize starches. Although it is difficult to perform an exhaustive collection of all pure LRP samples and possible adulterations, NIR spectrometry combined with class modeling techniques provides a reliable and effective method to detect most of the current LRP adulterations in Chinese market.

In this study, the presence of oleoyl-EFB₁ (EFB₁OA) and linoleoyl-EFB₁ (EFB₁LA) in raw maize is reported by means of a suitable LC-ESI-MS/MS method. In addition, the production of EFB₁ derivatives by three Fusarium verticillioides strains is described on malt extract-based media and on corn meal-based growth media. EFB₁OA and EFB₁LA were produced by all considered strains in corn meal medium, with EFB₁LA > EFB₁OA. On the contrary, EFB₁OA and EFB₁LA were never observed in Fusarium cultures grown on a malt extract medium, suggesting that the esterification of FB₁ can occur only in a complex matrix such as maize.","Food additives & contaminants.

A multi-component immunochromatographic assay (ICA) was developed for rapid and simultaneous determination of these three mycotoxins in agro-food. The strategy was performed based on the competitive immunoreactions between antibody-colloidal gold nanoparticle conjugate probes and mycotoxins or mycotixin antigens. Each monoclonal antibody specially recognize its corresponding mycotoxin and antigen, and there was no cross reactivity in the assay. Three mycotixin antigens were immobilized as three test lines in the nitrocellulose membrane reaction zone, which enable the simultaneous detection in one single test. The visible ICA results were obtained in 20 min. The visual detection limits of this strip test for the AFB1, OTA and ZEA were 0.25 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL, respectively. The assay was evaluated using spiked and naturally contaminated peanuts, maize and rice samples. The results were in accordance with those obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

23803568,"Corn tortillas are a staple in the diet among the Mexican population, and are traditionally produced through a process known as nixtamalization. This traditional process involves steeping whole-kernel corn in an alkaline solution overnight and then grinding the corn into dough (masa), which is then baked. While the masa is held before baking, significant microbial change can occur which leads to fermentation and spoilage. The objective of this research was to characterize and identify the microflora of nixtamalized corn masa from six different commercial tortilla mills throughout Guadalajara, Mexico. The identification of samples was conducted using the microbial identification system (MIS), which analyzes cellular fatty acids via gas chromatography to identify bacterial species. Lactic acid bacteria and aerobic mesophiles were the predominant organisms, with both groups having counts ranging from 10(4) to 10(7)cfu/g across all mills. Coliform populations were observed at counts of 10(2) to 10(3)cfu/g, while yeast and mold counts were typically less than 10(1)cfu/g. Some mills showed no presence of coliforms or yeast or mold. Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus oris were isolated from all mills, and were the most prevalent organisms representing 43% and 17% of all lactic acid bacteria isolated, respectively. S. bovis was also isolated on the aerobic tryptic soy plates and was the most prevalent species representing 19% of the total organisms from these aerobic plates.

Isolated strains produced a diverse amount of auxin in BG11 media supplemented with different concentrations of L-tryptophan. The amount of auxin detected with colorimetric methods was higher as compared to GC-MS analysis. Auxin production by cyanobacterial strains in BG 11 medium supplemented with 250 µg ml(-1) L-tryptophan ranged from 0.20 to 1.63 µg ml(-1) IAA as revealed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis. In a hydroponic growth system, the vegetative growth of wheat was stimulated appreciably by inoculation with cyanobacterial strains. The endogenous auxin content of wheat was significantly correlated with the exogenous auxin production of the cyanobacterial strains. It was observed that cyanobacterial strains produced more endogenous and exogenous auxin in the presence of a plant, showing that plants might be releasing some signals responsible for higher auxin production by cyanobacterial cultures.

ENs are produced by several Fusariun strains including Fusarium subglutinans, Fusarium proliferatum and Fusarium tricinctum. Production of a mixture of ENs was performed by culturing F. tricinctum ITEM 9496 on white corn as substrate. The solid culture components were dried and subsequently extracted with water/methanol (50/50 v/v, 0.5% NaCl), homogenised, filtered, extracted by ethyl acetate and analysed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection (LC-DAD). The crude extract was first separated by low pressure liquid chromatography (LPLC) and then further purified by liquid chromatography (LC), resulting in six compounds with a purity higher than 95% as calculated by (1)H NMR, and with a yield of 30-300mg per compound. The chemical structures of the ENs were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The biological activity of the resulting ENs was determined using a mitochondrial respiration test. We discovered that all the ENs studied induced an increase in the mitochondrial respiration resulting in uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation. This effect was most likely due to flux of K(+) ions into the mitochondrial matrix. The order of potency of the ENs derivatives was: A1>B1>B>A>B4>J1.

Rice proteins with molecular weights of 14-16, 26, 33, and 56 kDa have been identified as allergens. Recently, it was documented that the 56 kDa rice allergen was responsible for rice-induced anaphylaxis. The 14-16 kDa allergens have been identified as α-amylase inhibitors; the 26 kDa protein has been identified as α-globulin; and the 33 kDa protein has been identified as glyoxalase I. However, the identity of the 56 kDa rice allergen has not yet been determined. In this study, we demonstrate that serum from patients allergic to maize shows IgE binding to a 56 kDa protein that was present in both maize and rice but not in the oil seeds soybean and peanut. The 56 kDa IgE-binding protein was abundant in the rice endosperm. We have purified this protein from rice endosperm and demonstrated its reactivity to IgE antibodies from the serum of maize-allergic patients. The purified protein was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, resulting in identification of this rice allergen as granule-bound starch synthase, a product of the Waxy gene. Immunoblot analysis using protein extracts from a waxy mutant of rice revealed the absence of the 56 kDa IgE-binding protein. Our results demonstrate that the 56 kDa rice allergen is granule-bound starch synthase and raise the possibility of using waxy mutants of rice as a potential source of the hypoallergenic diet for patients sensitized to the 56 kDa rice allergen.

In this paper, a LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of DON, deoxynivalenol-3-β-D-glucoside (DON-3-glucoside), 3 acetyl-DON, nivalenol, fusarenon-X, diacetoxyscirpenol, HT-2 toxin, and T-2 toxin in naturally (n = 48) and artificially (n = 30) contaminated cereal grains (wheat, barley, oat, rye triticale) is reported. The method has also been applied to whole fresh maize plant intended for production of maize silage (n = 10). The samples were collected from the harvest years 2006-2010, The results show that DON-3-glucoside and DON co-occurred in cereal grains and, especially in several of the highly contaminated samples, the concentration of the glucoside can be relatively high, corresponding to over 37 % of the DON concentration. The DON-3-glucoside levels in both the naturally and in the artificially grain inoculated with Fusarium were second only to DON, and were generally higher than those of the other tested trichothecenes, which were found at low concentrations in most samples, in many cases even below the detection limit of the method. This argues for the importance of taking DON-3-glucoside into account in the ongoing discussion within the European Community concerning exposure re-evaluations for setting changed values for the tolerable intake for DON. Our results indicate that, in the naturally contaminated grains and in the Fusarium infested cereal grains (winter and spring wheat, oat, triticale), the concentration level of DON-3-glucoside is positively correlated to the DON content. When the DON concentration is high, then the content of DON-3-glucoside will most probably also be high and vice versa.",Mycotoxin research,"['D018554', 'D002853', 'D003718', 'D002523', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D005670', 'D005960', 'D001467', 'D013058', 'D012434', 'D014255', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Avena', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Denmark', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fusarium', 'Glucosides', 'Hordeum', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Secale', 'Trichothecenes', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Occurrence of different trichothecenes and deoxynivalenol-3-β-D-glucoside in naturally and artificially contaminated Danish cereal grains and whole maize plants.,"['Q000382', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000032', 'Q000382', 'Q000737']","['microbiology', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'microbiology', None, 'microbiology', 'analysis', 'microbiology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23606126,2013

23571334,"A total of 1,280 1-d-old ducks were used in a study to investigate the effects of increasing aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) concentrations from naturally contaminated corn on young ducklings, and the effectiveness of a clay adsorbent (CA) to protect against those effects. Ducks were randomly allotted to 8 treatments (TRT) in a 4 × 2 factorial arrangement with 4 levels of AFB1 (0, 25, 50, and 100 μg/kg) and 2 levels of CA (0 and 0.1%) with 8 pens per TRT and 20 ducks per pen. All ducks were allowed ad libitum access to feed and water during the 21-d experiment. The ADG, ADFI, feed conversion rate, mortality, bill color, and CV of BW of each replicate were measured at the end of the study. Blood and tissue samples from 8 ducks per TRT were obtained on d 21 of the experiment to determine the serum immunoglobulin and protein concentrations, relative organ weights, and intestinal morphology. Average daily gain and relative weights of the liver, spleen, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius decreased linearly (P < 0.05) as dietary AFB1 increased. Serum proteins and intestinal villi heights and villus/crypt ratio followed the same pattern. Bill decolorization ratio, CV of BW, and mortality increased linearly (P < 0.05) as dietary AFB1 increased. Adding 0.1% CA to the diet improved (P < 0.05) the relative weights of the small intestine, spleen, and thymus, and the villus height and villus/crypt ratio of the duodenum and jejunum, as well as the serum IgG and IgM concentrations. Adding CA also reduced (P < 0.05) bill decolorization ratio, CV of BW, mortality, and serum IgA concentration.

First, the stability of chloramphenicol in soil was studied. The fate of chloramphenicol highly depends on soil type and showed a half-life of approximately one day in nonsterile topsoil. It was found to be more stable in subsoil and sterile soils. Second, the production of chloramphenicol in soil was studied, and it was confirmed that Streptomyces venezuelae can produce chloramphenicol at appreciable amounts in nonsterile soil. Third, a transfer study was carried out using wheat and maize grown on three different soils that were weekly exposed to aqueous chloramphenicol solutions at different levels. Chloramphenicol was taken up by crops as determined by chiral liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometric analysis, and the levels in crops were found to be bioavailability related. It was concluded that chloramphenicol residues can occur naturally in crops as a result of the production of chloramphenicol by soil bacteria in their natural environment and subsequent uptake by crops.

23564285,"The benefits of using rapid qualitative methods to verify compliance of food and feed with legislation requirements include user-friendly format, the possibility of detection without expensive instrumentation, rapid response and affordable price. Prior to their use, however, the methods have to pass validation experiments, in order to assess their performance profile. An experimental protocol for in-house validation of a screening immunoassay has been designed and applied to evaluate performance characteristics of a multiplex dipstick kit for the determination of major Fusarium toxins, namely zearalenone, T-2 and HT-2 toxins, deoxynivalenol and fumonisins in wheat and maize. The test is intended for screening of cereals on the presence/absence of these mycotoxins at maximum permitted levels established by European legislation or target levels. The response of the measurement is determined with a reader device. Samples classified as negative are considered as compliant, whereas positive samples need to be re-analysed with confirmatory methods. The in-house validation design consisted of three steps, namely (1) estimating the precision of the method including ""between day"" effects and influences from different varieties of the matrices, (2) establishing robust cutoff values for the dipstick response at target mycotoxin levels assuming an acceptable rate of false negative results of 5% and (3) assessment of the rate of false positive results of blank samples and samples containing the target analytes below the legal limits. The total precision expressed as relative standard deviation and determined individually for each analyte/concentration/matrix combination varied from 9 to 30% and was considered as acceptable. In 17 out of 28 cases, the repeatability standard deviation was the most important factor. The predominance of the repeatability compared to the other factors (matrix, days) was an indicator for the ruggedness of the assay. The validation study demonstrated that the test was able to differentiate blank samples from samples contaminated at target mycotoxin levels with a false positive rate lower than 6%.

Residues of pesticides applied on crops are often found in the food which can cause chronic effect on the health of humans who consume such products. The aim of this study is to measure pesticides residues in maize and cowpea and compare the values with stablished safety limits. A total of 37 pesticides comprising 15 organochlorines, 13 organophosphorus and 9 pyrethroids pesticides were identified in maize and cowpea samples obtained from farms in Ejura. Analytical methods included solvent extraction of the pesticide residues and their subsequent quantification using gas chromatograph equipped with Electron Capture Detector and Pulse Flame Photometric Detector after clean-up on alumina/activated charcoal column. The results showed that the mean concentration of pesticides in maize ranged from 0.001 to 0.103 mg kg(-1) for organochlorine pesticides, 0.002-0.019 mg kg(-1) for organophosphorus pesticides and 0.002-0.028 mg kg(-1) for pyrethroids pesticides. In cowpea the mean concentration ranged from 0.001 to 0.108 mg kg(-1) for organochlorine pesticides, 0.002-0.015 mg kg(-1) for organophosphorus pesticides and 0.001-0.039 mg kg(-1) for pyrethroids pesticides. Maximum Residue Limits for β-HCH, β-endosulfan, p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD were exceeded in both maize and cowpea samples. Health risk estimation revealed that residues of heptachlor, dieldrin, endrin, β-endosulfna, γ-chlordane and chlorfenvinphos found in maize exceeded the Acceptable Daily Intake.

Numerous dogs died on additional farms, but those dogs were not included in the study. The farmers acquired the contaminated maize products, in the form of whole corn grain or as corn meal, from the same supplier. The corn product was mixed with meat that was left over from home or commercial rations to form corn polenta, which was fed to the dogs. Necropsy was performed on 3 dogs. Two of the dogs died after a few days of refusing food, showing anorexia, polydipsia, icteric mucous membranes, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena, and bleeding of the skin, eye, ear, and mouth. The primary necropsy findings included jaundice, hemorrhages in several organs, and yellowish enlarged liver with enhanced lobular pattern. The dog that experienced chronic ascites had a yellowish liver with reduced volume, irregular surface, and increased consistency. The main histological findings included hepatocyte fatty degeneration, biliary duct hyperplasia, cholestasis and, in the chronic case, hepatic fibrosis. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the corn meal from 2 affected farms revealed 1,640 ppb and 1,770 ppb of aflatoxin B1, respectively.

23315729,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a potent mycotoxin produced by Fusarium molds and affects intestinal nutrient absorption and barrier function in experimental and farm animals. Free DON and the plant metabolite DON-3-β-d-glucoside (D3G) are frequently found in wheat and maize. D3G is stable in the upper human gut, but some human intestinal bacteria release DON from D3G in vitro. Furthermore, some bacteria derived from animal digestive systems degrade DON to a less toxic metabolite, deepoxy-deoxynivalenol (DOM-1). The metabolism of D3G and DON by the human microbiota has not been fully assessed. We therefore conducted in vitro batch culture experiments assessing the activity of the human fecal microbiota to release DON from D3G. We also studied detoxification of DON to DOM-1 by the microbiota and its potential effect on urinary DON excretion in humans. Fecal slurry from five volunteers was spiked with DON or D3G and incubated anaerobically (from 1 h to 7 days), and mycotoxins were extracted into acetonitrile. Mycotoxins were detected in fecal extracts and urine by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The fecal microbiota released DON from D3G very efficiently, with hydrolysis peaking after 4 to 6 h. The fecal microbiota from one volunteer transformed DON to DOM-1. Urine from the same volunteer also contained DOM-1 (4.7% of DON), whereas DOM-1 was not detectable in urine from other volunteers. Our results confirm that the fecal microbiota releases DON from its glycosylated form, hence increasing the toxic burden in exposed individuals. Furthermore, this is first evidence that the human fecal microbiota of one volunteer detoxifies DON, resulting in the appearance of DOM-1 in urine.",Applied and environmental microbiology,"['D001419', 'D002853', 'D005243', 'D005960', 'D006805', 'D006801', 'D053719', 'D014255']","['Bacteria', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Feces', 'Glucosides', 'Human Experimentation', 'Humans', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Trichothecenes']",The human fecal microbiota metabolizes deoxynivalenol and deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside and may be responsible for urinary deepoxy-deoxynivalenol.,"['Q000378', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378']","['metabolism', None, 'microbiology', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23315729,2013

23276694,"Fumonisins (FBs) are bioactive compounds produced by several strains of Fusarium spp. which contain a polyketide structure similar to sphinganine. These mycotoxins contain a free amino group that could work as an electron donor and react with the electrophile carbon present within the isothiocyanate (ITC) group. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of ITCs (allyl, benzyl and phenyl) on the stability of FB(1), FB(2) and FB(3). Firstly, PBS solutions at three pH levels (4, 7 and 9) were prepared and added with pairs of one FB (1 mg/L) plus one ITC (1 mg/L). Then, gaseous ITC was used to fumigate corn kernels and corn flour contaminated with FBs produced by Gibberella moniliformis CECT 2987 in situ. Mycotoxin levels were evaluated using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in tandem (LC-MS/MS), while products formed from the reaction of FBs and ITCs were examined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry-linear ion trap (LC-MS-LIT). The reduction of FB(1) and FB(2) in solution ranged from 42 to 100% on a time-dependent manner. This variance was greatly influenced by pH. In general, lower pH levels eased the reaction between ITCs and FBs. ITC fumigation treatment (50, 100 and 500 μL/L) was able to reduce 53-96% of FB(1) levels, 29-91% of FB(2) and 29-96% of FB(3).

23275133,"The analysis of deoxynivalenol (DON) in silage samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) often leads to an overestimation. To better analyze DON in rice and corn silages using a commercially available ELISA kit, a cleanup method using a MultiSep #226 column was developed. As a result, overestimation of DON by the influence of specific cross-reaction with acetyldeoxynivalenol (AcDON) was confirmed. In samples where AcDON was not detected by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), no samples showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in DON amounts between ELISA with cleanup and LC-MS analysis. For the recovery study, blank silage was spiked with 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg DON. The mean recoveries of DON determined by ELISA with cleanup and LC-MS analysis were 112 and 96%, respectively, and the relative standard deviation for the repeatability (RSDr) were 8.2 and 9.8%, respectively. No samples showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in DON concentration determined by either ELISA or LC-MS analysis. A collaborative study to validate this rapid method was carried out using four samples, two rice and two corn silage, by 10 participating laboratories. Each sample was analyzed using blind duplicates. The mean values of DON detected were 1.5-2.3 mg/kg, RSDr and the relative standard deviation for the reproducibility (RSDR) were 4.1-12.7 and 7.6-23.4%, respectively, and the HorRat values were 0.5-1.6. Therefore, the overestimation of DON by the influence of nonspecific cross-reaction with sample matrix was reduced by the cleanup method using a MultiSep #226 column, and analysis of DON in silage was improved.

Rice cultured with Fusarium verticillioides was extracted with a mixture of methanol/water and found to contain 0.87 mg of FB1 per gram. The crude extracts were purified on a strong anion-exchange column and then separated by using a biphasic solvent system consisting of methyl-tert-butyl-ether-acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid in water. The collected fractions were analysed by flow injection-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Corona-charged aerosol detector and identified by congruent retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric data.

In addition to this, due to its considerable advantages over other techniques, RFGC was used for the characterization of a new biocatalyst, yeast cells immobilized on starch gel, and especially wheat starch gel. Immobilization of wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae AXAZ-1 was accomplished on wheat and corn starch gels in order to prepare new biocatalysts with great interest for the fermentation industry. The RFGC led with great accuracy, resulting from a literature review, to the determination of reaction rate constants and activation energies at each phase of the fermentation processes. A maximum value of rate constants was observed at initial glucose concentration of 205 g/L, where a higher number of yeast cells was observed. The increase of glucose concentrations had a negative influence on the growth of AXAZ-1 cells and rate constants were decreased. The decrease of fermentation temperature caused a substantial reduction in the viability of immobilized cells as well as in rate constant values.

22851152,"Aristolochic acids (AAs) are nephrotoxic and carcinogenic derivatives found in several Aristolochia species. To date, the toxicity of AAs has been inferred only from the effects observed in patients suffering from a kidney disease called ""aristolochic acid nephropathy"" (AAN, formerly known as ""Chinese herbs nephropathy""). More recently, the chronic poisoning with Aristolochia seeds has been considered to be the main cause of Balkan endemic nephropathy, another form of chronic renal failure resembling AAN. So far, it was assumed that AAs can enter the human food chain only through ethnobotanical use (intentional or accidental) of herbs containing self-produced AAs. We hypothesized that the roots of some crops growing in fields where Aristolochia species grew over several seasons may take up certain amounts of AAs from the soil, and thus become a secondary source of food poisoning. To verify this possibility, maize plant (Zea mays) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) were used as a model to substantiate the possible significance of naturally occurring AAs' root uptake in food chain contamination. This study showed that the roots of maize plant and cucumber are capable of absorbing AAs from nutrient solution, consequently producing strong peaks on ultraviolet HPLC chromatograms of plant extracts. This uptake resulted in even higher concentrations of AAs in the roots compared to the nutrient solutions. To further validate the measurement of AA content in the root material, we also measured their concentrations in nutrient solutions before and after the plant treatment. Decreased concentrations of both AAI and AAII were found in nutrient solutions after plant growth. During this short-term experiment, there were much lower concentrations of AAs in the leaves than in the roots. The question is whether these plants are capable of transferring significant amounts of AAs from the roots into edible parts of the plant during prolonged experiments.",Environmental geochemistry and health,"['D034341', 'D001449', 'D002851', 'D018553', 'D005517', 'D006801', 'D018517', 'D003313']","['Aristolochic Acids', 'Balkan Nephropathy', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cucumis sativus', 'Foodborne Diseases', 'Humans', 'Plant Roots', 'Zea mays']",Possible health impacts of naturally occurring uptake of aristolochic acids by maize and cucumber roots: links to the etiology of endemic (Balkan) nephropathy.,"['Q000378', 'Q000209', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000150', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","['metabolism', 'etiology', None, 'metabolism', 'complications', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22851152,2013

22793673,"The presence of phenolic acids in cereal grain is thought to influence starch hydrolysis during liquefaction and saccharification of grain flours in the bioethanol industry. As a basis for remodeling starch hydrolysis systems and understanding inhibition mechanisms, the composition and concentration of phenolic acids in whole grain flours of triticale, wheat, barley, and corn were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The total phenolic acid contents (sum of nine phenolic acids) in the four grains were 1.14, 1.70, 0.90, and 1.25 mg/g, respectively, with more than 90% found in the bound form. Ferulic, coumaric, and protocatechuic acids were the major phenolic acids in triticale and wheat. Gallic acid was also rich in triticale. Ferulic, coumaric, hydroxybenzoic, and gallic acids were predominant in barley. In corn, ferulic, coumaric, gallic, and syringic acids were abundant. On the basis of these profiles, pure phenolic acids were added individually and collectively to isolated starches at amounts either equivalent to or 3 times those in the whole grains for hydrolysis. The degree of starch hydrolysis with α-amylase and amyloglucosidase decreased up to 8% when individual phenolic acids were present in cooked starch slurry. The decreases were more pronounced when phenolic acids were added collectively (4-5% with α-amylase and 9-13% with sequential α-amylase and amyloglucosidase). The study of a phenolic acid-starch-enzyme model system indicated that the interactions of phenolic acid-enzyme and phenolic acid-starch significantly contributed to the inhibitory effect of starch hydrolysis. Heating facilitated the interactions. Phenolic acids thus play a significant role in the resistance of starch to enzyme and/or the loss of enzyme activity during starch hydrolysis.

22494580,"This study examined the relationship between storage environmental factors (water activity (a(w)) (0.89-0.97) and temperature (15°C-30°C)), colonisation of wheat and maize by Fusarium graminearum and F. verticillioides respectively and the dry matter losses (DMLs) caused and quantified by contamination with deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisins (FUMs) during storage. Fungal growth was assessed by the amount of CO(2) produced under different interacting conditions of a(w) and temperature. DMLs were quantified using the cumulative CO(2) data, and these were shown to increase as temperature and a(w) increased. The amount of DON, ZEA (wheat for human consumption) and FUMs (feed maize) produced was significantly affected by the storage conditions. The three toxins however showed different patterns of production. Optimum for DON was at the wettest conditions (0.97a(w)) and the highest temperature assessed (30°C), whereas for ZEA this shifted to 25°C. FUMs were produced in higher amounts in maize at 30°C and 0.97a(w); however, at intermediate a(w) levels (0.955a(w)), the highest production occurred at 25°C followed by 20°C. Polynomial models were developed for the effect of the storage factors on DMLs and toxin production. DMLs under different environmental conditions were significantly correlated with DON and FUMs. DON contamination was above the EU limits in at least 80% of the wheat samples with DMLs >1%, whereas at least 70% of the same samples contained ZEA above the respective EU legislative limits. Similarly, at least 75% of the maize samples with DMLs ≥ 0.9% exceeded the EU limits for the sum of FUMs in feed. These results show that it may be possible to use temporal CO(2) production during storage of grains as an indicator of the level of contamination of the grain with mycotoxins.","Food additives & contaminants.

Gluten-Tec is a competitive ELISA that detects an immunostimulatory epitope of a-gliadin in dietary food for celiacs. Fifteen laboratories, representing 14 different countries, announced their interest in taking part in this study. Of the 12 laboratories that sent the results within the established timeframe, two submitted inappropriate standard curves and were excluded from the statistical analysis. Four different food matrixes (rice-based baby food, maize bread, chocolate cake mix, and beer) were selected for preparing the test samples. Two gliadin extraction procedures were used: the conventional 60% ethanol, and a new method based on the reducing reagent dithiothreitol. The 38 samples (19 blind duplicates) tested in this study were prepared by diluting the different extracts in order to cover a wide range of gliadin levels. Both sample extraction and dilution were performed by EuroProxima; the present interlaboratory study was focused only on testing the ELISA part of the Gluten-Tec kit protocol.

Wet and dry cracked corn controls were included as needed. Secondary metabolic volatiles were identified and aflatoxin concentrations determined over a 12-day period. Volatiles unique to the toxigenic A. flavus isolates were determined by comparison with volatiles produced by the respective corn controls and the non-toxigenic A. flavus isolate. The number and identity of the volatiles produced by these A. flavus isolates varied by isolate, whether sterile or non-sterile corn was the substrate, and the sampling day. Overall, most of the volatiles were produced before day 8 after inoculation. Aflatoxin production was 10-fold lower on the sterile corn, compared to the non-sterile corn. Volatiles unique to the aflatoxin producing isolates were identified on both substrates after comparison with those produced by the non-aflatoxin producing isolate, as well as the corn control samples.

The sugars fed to the bees were two C4 sugars (cane sugar and maize hydrolysate), two C3 sugars (sugar beet, cereal starch hydrolysate), and honey. The proteins fed to them were pollen, soybean, and yeast powder proteins. To evaluate the influence of the sugar and/or protein feeding over time, samples were collected during six consecutive harvests. (13)C isotopic ratio measurements of natural RJs gave values of around -25 ‰, which were also seen for RJs obtained when the bees were fed honey or C3 sugars. However, the RJs obtained when the bees were fed cane sugar or corn hydrolysate (regardless of whether they were also fed proteins) gave values of up to -17 ‰. Sugar content analysis revealed that the composition of maltose, maltotriose, sucrose, and erlose varied significantly over time in accordance with the composition of the syrup fed to the bees. When corn and cereal starch hydrolysates were fed to the bees, the maltose and maltotriose contents of the RJs increased up to 5.0 and 1.3 %, respectively, compared to the levels seen in authentic samples (i.e., samples obtained when the bees were fed natural food: honey and pollen) that were inferior to 0.2% and not detected, respectively. The sucrose and erlose contents of natural RJs were around 0.2 %, whereas those in RJs obtained when the bees were fed cane or beet sugar were as much as 4.0 and 1.3 %, respectively.

Food grade corn grits and 2 batches of grits contaminated with FB₁ at 10 and 50 μg/g by Fusarium verticillioides M-2552 were processed with or without glucose supplementation (10%, w/w) with a twin-screw extruder. Extrusion reduced FB₁ in contaminated grits by 64% to 72% without glucose and 89% to 94% with added glucose. In addition, extrusion alone resulted in 26% to 73% reduction in the levels of fumonisin B₂ and fumonisin B₃, while levels of both mycotoxins were reduced by >89% in extruded corn grits containing 10% glucose. Mass balance analysis showed that 38% to 46% of the FB₁ species detected in corn extruded with glucose was N-(deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-FB₁, while 23% to 37% of FB₁ species detected in extruded corn grits with and without added glucose was bound to the matrix. It was also found that the hydrolyzed form of FB₁ was a minor species in extruded corn grits with or without added glucose, representing <15% of the total FB₁ species present.

During these processing steps, sugars can be considerably degraded, leading, for example, to the formation of reactive α-dicarbonyl compounds (α-DCs). The present study performed targeted screening to identify the major α-DCs in HFCS. For this purpose, α-DCs were selectively converted with o-phenylendiamine to the corresponding quinoxaline derivatives, which were analyzed by liquid chromatography with hyphenated diode array-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MS/MS) detection. 3-Deoxy-D-erythro-hexos-2-ulose (3-deoxyglucosone), D-lyxo-hexos-2-ulose (glucosone), 3-deoxy-D-threo-hexos-2-ulose (3-deoxygalactosone), 1-deoxy-D-erythro-hexos-2,3-diulose (1-deoxyglucosone), 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene, methylglyoxal, and glyoxal were identified by enhanced mass spectra as well as MS/MS product ion spectra using the synthesized standards as reference. Addition of diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid and adjustment of the derivatization conditions ensured complete derivatization without de novo formation for all identified α-DCs in HFCS matrix except for glyoxal. Subsequently, a ultra-high performance LC-DAD-MS/MS method was established to quantify 3-deoxyglucosone, glucosone, 3-deoxygalactosone, 1-deoxyglucosone, 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene, and methylglyoxal in HFCS. Depending on the α-DC compound and concentration, the recovery ranged between 89.2% and 105.8% with a relative standard deviation between 1.9% and 6.5%. Subsequently, the α-DC profiles of 14 commercial HFCS samples were recorded. 3-Deoxyglucosone was identified as the major α-DC with concentrations up to 730 μg/mL HFCS. The total α-DC content ranged from 293 μg/mL to 1,130 μg/mL HFCS.

22365676,"The only treatment for coeliac disease is to follow a strict, life-long gluten-free diet. It is therefore essential to use a highly sensitive, specific technique for gluten analysis in foods. Nowadays, the usual method for determining gluten content in gluten-free foods, internationally accepted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, is the R5 antibody-based sandwich ELISA, combined with the cocktail-extraction solution. This technique requires at least two epitopes in the protein, but in hydrolysed foods, proteins are fragmented during food processing and converted into peptides in which only one toxic epitope may appear. Consequently, it was necessary to develop a new competitive immunoassay that, together with a reliable, compatible extraction solution, would provide a complete gluten analysis in any kind of food. We analysed commercial foods and home-made maize breads spiked with a known amount of gliadins using the sandwich R5 ELISA and the new competitive R5 ELISA that has been developed. These foods had previously been extracted with 60% ethanol/water, the cocktail solution or the new extracting solution called UPEX (universal prolamin and glutelin extractant solution). The complementary SDS-PAGE and western blot techniques were also used to confirm the gluten content. The limits of detection and quantification of the competitive R5 ELISA were 0.36 and 1.22 ng/ml of gliadins, respectively. The intra- and inter-assay precisions based on two samples were, respectively, 7.3% and 5.4% for the first sample and 9.9% and 6.3% for the second. This new assay was a better technique than the sandwich R5 ELISA for detecting gliadins quantitatively in hydrolysed foods. Regarding the extraction procedure, we did not find any significant interference from components of the UPEX solution at the concentration used. In addition, the UPEX solution extraction was compatible with the R5 western blot and mass spectrometry techniques. The competitive R5 ELISA we developed, combined with the UPEX solution described here, is a very useful tool for detecting and quantifying gluten in any kind of food samples, including heat-treated and/or hydrolysed ones.",Talanta,"['D000906', 'D055050', 'D004797', 'D005504', 'D005511', 'D005983', 'D006868']","['Antibodies', 'Diet, Gluten-Free', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Glutens', 'Hydrolysis']",Comprehensive analysis of gluten in processed foods using a new extraction method and a competitive ELISA based on the R5 antibody.,"[None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, 'methods', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22365676,2012

Soils and maize tissues were sampled from 40 farms in Tanzania and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in the United Kingdom. The results showed high levels of PTEs in both soils and maize tissues above the recommended limits. Nickel levels of up to 34.4 and 56.9mgkg(-1) respectively were found in some maize shoots and grains from several districts. Also, high Pb levels >0.2mgkg(-1) were found in some grains. The grains and shoots with high levels of Ni and Pb are unfit for human and animal consumption. Concentrations of individual elements in maize tissues and soils did not correlate and showed differences in uptake and translocation. However, Ni showed a more efficient transfer from soils to shoots than As, Pb and Cr. Transfer of Cr and Ni from shoots to grains was higher than other elements, implying that whatever amount is assimilated in maize shoots is efficiently mobilized and transferred to grains. Thus, the study recommended to the public to stop consuming and feeding their animals maize with high levels of PTEs for their safety.",The Science of the total environment,"['D000383', 'D000818', 'D001151', 'D002857', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D007854', 'D008452', 'D009532', 'D018570', 'D012987', 'D012989', 'D013636', 'D003313']","['Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Chromium', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Lead', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Nickel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Tanzania', 'Zea mays']",Risk assessment of potentially toxic elements in agricultural soils and maize tissues from selected districts in Tanzania.,"[None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000009', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000009', None, 'Q000009', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000009', None, 'Q000009']","[None, None, 'adverse effects', 'adverse effects', 'analysis', None, 'adverse effects', None, 'adverse effects', None, 'analysis', 'adverse effects', None, 'adverse effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22226395,2012
22220906,"The aim of this study was to apply an untargeted NMR and LC-MS-based metabolomics approach to detect potential differences between an organically and a conventionally produced feed, which caused statistically significant differences in growth, in the response to an immunological challenge and in the gene expression profiles in the small intestine of laying hens. A fractionation procedure was set up to create multiple fractions of the feed, which were subsequently analysed by NMR and UPLC-TOF/MS operating in positive mode. Comparison of the profiles revealed that the most apparent differences came from the isoflavones in the soy as well as a compound with a molecular mass of 441.202 (M + 1)⁺, which was identified as N,N'-diferuloylputrescine (DFP) and came from the corn. Whether the observed differences in effects are due to the higher levels of isoflavones and DFP is unclear, as is the fact whether the observed differences are typical for organic or conventional produced corn and soy. However, this study shows that this metabolomics approach is suitable for detecting potential differences between products, even in levels of compounds that would have been overlooked with a more targeted approach. As such, the method is suitable for a more systematic study on differences between conventionally and organically produced food.","Food additives & contaminants.

The corn strain prefers crop plants such as corn, sorghum, and cotton, while the rice strain is found in small grasses such as Cynodon spp. and rice. Little is known about the physiological factors that drive this host preference. Here, we report a feeding study with natural host plants and an artificial diet containing cyanide. We found that corn, two Cynodon spp. (bermudagrass C. dactylon (L.) Persoon, 'NuMex Sahara', and stargrass C. nlemfuensis var. nlemfuensis Vanderyst, 'Florona'), and a hybrid between bermudagrass and stargrass, 'Tifton 85', exhibited differences in the concentration of the cyanogenic precursors or cyanogenic potential (HCNp) and the release of hydrogen cyanide per unit time or cyanogenic capacity (HCNc). Corn plants released low levels of hydrogen cyanide, while stargrass had greater HCNp/HCNc than bermudagrass and 'Tifton 85'. Feeding studies showed that corn strain larvae experienced higher mortality than the rice strain when fed stargrass or artificial diet supplemented with cyanide. Also, corn strain larvae excreted higher levels of cyanogenic compounds than the rice strain when fed Cynodon spp. These differences in excretion suggest potential disparities in cyanide metabolism between the two strains.

22098923,"An internal fruit rot disease of sweet peppers was first detected in Belgium in 2003. Research conducted mostly in Canada indicates that this disease is primarily caused by Fusarium lactis Pirotta. Ninety-eight Fusarium isolates obtained from diseased sweet peppers from Belgium, as well as from other countries (Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) were identified by sequencing the translation elongation factor 1α (EF). Of these 98 isolates, 13 were identified as F. oxysporum Schltdl., nine as F. proliferatum (Matsush.) Nirenberg and two belonged to clade 3 of the F. solani species complex. Of the 74 remaining isolates, the EF sequence showed 97% to 98% similarity to F. lactis. Of these isolates, the β-tubulin (TUB), calmodulin (CAM) and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) genes were also sequenced. Analysis of the combined sequences revealed that the 74 isolates share nine combined sequences that correspond to nine multilocus sequence types (STs), while the F. lactis neotype strain and one other strain, both isolated from figs, form a separate ST. Together, these 10 STs represent a monophyletic F. lactis species complex (FLASC). An unusually high level of genetic diversity was observed between (groups of) these STs. Two of them (ST5 and ST6) fulfilled the criteria for species recognition based on genealogical exclusivity and together represent a new monophyletic species lineage (FLASC-1). The seven other STs, together with the F. lactis neotype ST, form a paraphyletic species lineage in the African clade of the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (GFSC). From each of the 10 STs, the mycotoxin production was assessed using a multi-mycotoxin liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. Out of the 27 analyzed mycotoxins, beauvericin and fumonisins were detected in sweet pepper tissue and in maize kernels. The 10 STs clearly differed in the amount of mycotoxin produced, but there was only limited congruence between the production profile and the phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, the morphological characterization (based on mycelial growth rate and the length of macroconidia) showed distinct differences between the 10 STs, but again there was limited congruence with the phylogenetic results. In conclusion, the data presented in this study demonstrate that 75% of the isolates obtained from sweet pepper with internal fruit rot belong to a F. lactis species complex (FLASC), including a new FLASC-1 monophyletic species, and that the members of this complex display great genetic and phenotypic diversity.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D001530', 'D002147', 'D002170', 'D002212', 'D005670', 'D014644', 'D008969', 'D058885', 'D009183', 'D009426', 'D020648', 'D012319', 'D014404', 'D006113', 'D003313']","['Belgium', 'Calmodulin', 'Canada', 'Capsicum', 'Fusarium', 'Genetic Variation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multilocus Sequence Typing', 'Mycotoxins', 'Netherlands', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Tubulin', 'United Kingdom', 'Zea mays']",Genetic diversity and mycotoxin production of Fusarium lactis species complex isolates from sweet pepper.,"[None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235']","[None, 'genetics', None, 'microbiology', 'genetics', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22098923,2012

Numerous investigations have focused on grain maize, but little is known about the Fusarium species in the entire plant used for silage. Furthermore, mycotoxins persist during the ensiling process and thus endanger feed safety. In the current study, we analyzed 20 Swiss silage maize samples from growers' fields for the incidence of Fusarium species and mycotoxins. The species spectrum was analyzed morphologically and mycotoxins were measured by LC-MS/MS. A pre-harvest visual disease rating showed few disease symptoms. In contrast, the infection rate of two-thirds of the harvest samples ranged from 25 to 75% and twelve different Fusarium species were isolated. The prevailing species were F. sporotrichioides, F. verticillioides and F. graminearum. No infection specificity for certain plant parts was observed. The trichothecene deoxynivalenol (DON) was found in each sample (ranging from 780 to 2990 µg kg(-1)). Other toxins detected in descending order were zearalenone, further trichothecenes (nivalenol, HT-2 and T-2 toxin, acetylated DON) and fumonisins.

Nevertheless, the composition and identity of the protein component has never been determined. In the present study, CFG was deglycosylated by treating with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, and the resulting proteins were purified by passage through C18 solid phase extraction cartridges. The proteins were then separated and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein band from the gel was treated with a proteolytic enzyme, chymotrypsin, and the resulting peptides were cleaned using C18 Zip Tip pipet tips and analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with automated tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

None of the visually uninfected maize had detectable amounts of fumonisins. The total fumonisin concentration was 0.28-1.1 mg kg(-1) for good-quality batches and 0.03-6.2 mg kg(-1) for mouldy-quality batches. The high fumonisin content in the batches was apparently caused by a small number (4%) of highly contaminated kernels, and removal of these reduced the average fumonisin content by 71%.

These topics are attracting a great deal of attention, especially in recent years, when the international community has become increasingly aware of the central role of food quality and safety and their influence on the health of end-consumers. Early proteomics studies in the field of food research were mainly aimed at performing exploratory analyses of food (bovine, swine, chicken, or lamb meat, but also transgenic food such as genetically modified maize, for example) and beverages (wine), with the goal of improving the quality of the end-products.

21854354,"A liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry-based method is reported for the quantification of 20 selected mycotoxins and the simultaneous screening for 200 fungal metabolites in food. For regulated mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone and trichothecenes, the evaluation of the method performance characteristics, such as precision, trueness, limit of detection and matrix effects, has been exemplified for the matrix maize. In the case of the limit of detection, an alternative evaluation approach for high-resolution FT-Orbitrap data is proposed. Measurements of the signal-to-noise ratios obtained from 'full-profile mode' data led to detection limits between 8 and 160 ng g(-1). Eight naturally contaminated wheat- and maize-based matrix test materials, originating from interlaboratory comparison studies, were used to confirm the trueness of the method for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisin B(1) and B(2), HT-2, and T-2 toxin. In addition to accurate quantification of the most relevant mycotoxins, the full-scan chromatograms were used to investigate the potential of the FT-Orbitrap to screen simultaneously for a large number of fungal metabolites. First, a list of 200 metabolites, potentially being present in food samples, was established. Next, specific detection and identification criteria were defined, which are based on accurate mass, peak intensity and isotopologue ratio. The application of these criteria to the suspected metabolites from the list resulted in the putative identification of 13 fungal metabolites in addition to the target toxins.","Food additives & contaminants.

21803647,"To date, there is no study on bioethanol processing-induced changes in molecular structural profiles mainly related to lipid biopolymer. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine molecular structural changes of lipid related functional groups in the co-products that occurred during bioethanol processing; (2) relatively quantify the antisymmetric CH(3) and CH(2) (ca. 2959 and 2928 cm(-1), respectively), symmetric CH(3) and CH(2) (ca. 2871 and 2954 cm(-1), respectively) functional groups, carbonyl C=O ester (ca. 1745 cm(-1)) and unsaturated groups (CH attached to C=C) (ca. 3007 cm(-1)) spectral intensities as well as their ratios of antisymmetric CH(3) to antisymmetric CH(2), and (3) illustrate the molecular spectral analyses as a research tool to detect for the sensitivity of individual moleculars to the bioethanol processing in a complex plant-based feed and food system without spectral parameterization. The hypothesis of this study was that bioethanol processing changed the molecular structure profiles in the co-products as opposed to original cereal grains. These changes could be detected by infrared molecular spectroscopy and will be related to nutrient utilization. The results showed that bioethanol processing had effects on the functional groups spectral profiles in the co-products. It was found that the CH(3)-antisymmetric to CH(2)-antisymmetric stretching intensity ratio was changed. The spectral features of carbonyl C=O ester group and unsaturated group were also different. Since the different types of cereal grains (wheat vs. corn) had different sensitivity to the bioethanol processing, the spectral patterns and band component profiles differed between their co-products (wheat DDGS vs. corn DDGS). The multivariate molecular spectral analyses, cluster analysis and principal component analysis of original spectra (without spectral parameterization), distinguished the structural differences between the wheat and wheat DDGS and between the corn and corn DDGS in the antisymmetric and symmetric CH(3) and CH(2) spectral region (ca. 2994-2800 cm(-1)) and unsaturated group band region (3025-2996 cm(-1)).

21742923,"We measured expression and used biochemical characterization of multiple carbohydrate esterases by the xylanolytic rumen bacterium Prevotella ruminicola 23 grown on an ester-enriched substrate to gain insight into the carbohydrate esterase activities of this hemicellulolytic rumen bacterium. The P. ruminicola 23 genome contains 16 genes predicted to encode carbohydrate esterase activity, and based on microarray data, four of these were upregulated >2-fold at the transcriptional level during growth on an ester-enriched oligosaccharide (XOS(FA,Ac)) from corn relative to a nonesterified fraction of corn oligosaccharides (AXOS). Four of the 16 esterases (Xyn10D-Fae1A, Axe1-6A, AxeA1, and Axe7A), including the two most highly induced esterases (Xyn10D-Fae1A and Axe1-6A), were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and biochemically characterized. All four enzymes showed the highest activity at physiologically relevant pH (6 to 7) and temperature (30 to 40°C) ranges. The P. ruminicola 23 Xyn10D-Fae1A (a carbohydrate esterase [CE] family 1 enzyme) released ferulic acid from methylferulate, wheat bran, corn fiber, and XOS(FA,Ac), a corn fiber-derived substrate enriched in O-acetyl and ferulic acid esters, but exhibited negligible activity on sugar acetates. As expected, the P. ruminicola Axe1-6A enzyme, which was predicted to possess two distinct esterase family domains (CE1 and CE6), released ferulic acid from the same substrates as Xyn10D-Fae1 and was also able to cleave O-acetyl ester bonds from various acetylated oligosaccharides (AcXOS). The P. ruminicola 23 AxeA1, which is not assigned to a CE family, and Axe7A (CE7) were found to be acetyl esterases that had activity toward a broad range of mostly nonpolymeric acetylated substrates along with AcXOS. All enzymes were inhibited by the proximal location of other side groups like 4-O-methylglucuronic acid, ferulic acid, or acetyl groups.

Recently, various toxic effects of PFC's in laboratory rats have been demonstrated, resulting in increased government concerns regarding the presence of PFC's in the environment and the implications they have on human health. In the last decade, various analytical methods have been developed for the analysis of PFC's in different matrices whereby the majority of methods have utilised liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Here we describe an optimized method for the quantitation of PFC's, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), in food packaging, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sealant tape and drinking water. The method involved PFC's extraction via off-line SPE followed by separation using reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a Phenyl-Hexyl column coupled with ion-trap (IT) mass spectrometric detection. The optimized approach minimized ion-suppression effects commonly seen with conventional elution buffers, improving detection limits down to 25 pg/mL and allowed effective quantitation down to 50 pg/mL for PFOA and PFOS. The optimized LC-MS method detected PFOA and other PFC's in microwave popcorn packaging and PFOA in PTFE sealant tape in the low μg/kg. In all samples, PFOS was not detected.","Journal of chromatography.

This alteration has been proposed as a biomarker of fumonisin exposure. The objective of this study was to establish the urinary and plasmatic levels of Sa, So as well as the ratio Sa/So from a sample of the Catalonian (Spain) population exposed to fumonisins at low levels. Firstly, plasma and urinary Sa and So levels and the ratio Sa/So were compared between two population groups, and later urinary Sa and So levels from corn food consumers and a control group were monitored for 2 weeks under controlled intake of corn foods. Sa and So levels were determined in urine and blood samples using validated methods using HPLC with fluorescence detection. Significant differences were not found in urine samples when Sa/So ratios were compared from corn food consumers and non-consumers, while significant differences were found in urine and plasma samples, but evidence of the mechanism of action of fumonisins was not apparent. Through a time-course study we have narrowed down the day in which the maximum alteration of Sa/So ratio should be expected in humans.

After extraction of aflatoxins from cereal matrices with a mixture of methanol/water 8:2 (v/v), the analytes were rapidly transferred from the extract to another small volume of organic solvent, chloroform, by DLLME. Aflatoxins were determined using high performance liquid chromatography with florescence detection and photochemical post-column derivatization. Parameters affecting both extraction and DLLME procedures, such as extraction solvent, type and volume of DLLME extractant, volume of water and salt effect, were systematically investigated and optimized to achieve the best extraction efficiency. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the whole analytical method provides enrichment factors around 2.5 times and detection limits (0.01-0.17 μg kg(-1)) below the maximum levels imposed by current regulation for aflatoxins in cereals and cereal products intended for direct human consumption.

21421362,"RNA-binding proteins play critical roles at multiple steps during gene expression, including mRNA transport and translation. mRNA transport is particularly important in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in order to ensure the proper localization of the prolamine and glutelin seed storage proteins. However, relatively little information is available about RNA-binding proteins that have been isolated or characterized in plants. The RiceRBP database is a novel resource for the analysis of RNA-binding proteins in rice. RiceRBP contains 257 experimentally identified RNA-binding proteins, which are derived from at least 221 distinct rice genes. Many of the identified proteins catalogued in RiceRBP had not previously been annotated or predicted to bind RNA. RiceRBP provides tools to facilitate the analysis of the identified RNA-binding proteins, including information about predicted protein domains, phylogenetic relationships, and expression patterns of the identified genes. Importantly, RiceRBP also contains tools to search and analyze predicted RNA-binding protein orthologs in other plant species.

Thereafter an analytical method was optimised using extraction with an acidic mixture of methanol-acetonitrile-citrate/phosphate buffer, clean-up through the immunoaffinity column and determination of fumonisins by liquid chromatography with automated pre-column derivatisation with o-phthaldialdehyde reagent. Recovery experiments performed on yellow, white and blue masa flours at spiking levels of 400, 800 and 1200 µg kg(-1) FB(1) and of 100, 200 and 300 µg kg(-1) FB(2) gave overall mean recoveries of 99% (±6%) for FB(1) and 88% (±6%) for FB(2).

Many new fumonisins and fumonisin-like compounds have been detected by mass spectrometry in cultures of F. verticillioides. Recently, fumonisins B(2) and B(4) were produced by Aspergillus niger isolated from coffee and fumonisin B(2) in A. niger from grapes. Fumonisin B(2) was itself detected in coffee beans, wine and beer, adding to the list of foodstuffs and feedstuffs other than corn (maize) and sorghum in which fumonisins have been found in recent years. Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) can bind to proteins (PB FB(1)) and to other matrix components during food processing involving heat. The occurrence of bound fumonisins in processed corn foods is common. Another type of binding (or association) relates to observed instability of fumonisins in rice flour, corn starch and corn meal at room temperature; this can affect the immunoaffinity column clean-up procedure in analysis of naturally contaminated starch-containing corn foods for fumonisins. The occurrence of N-fatty acylated fumonisin derivatives in retail fried corn foods has also been demonstrated. Bioaccessibility of free FB(1) and total bound FB(1) (TB FB(1)) present in corn flakes has been estimated by in vitro digestion experiments. Intentional binding of fumonisins to cholestyramine has been demonstrated in vivo and is a potential means of detoxification of animal feed.","Food additives & contaminants.

The mycotoxins included aflatoxins (AFB(1), AFB(2), AFG(1), and AFG(2)), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEA), deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisins (FB(1), FB(2), and FB(3)), T-2 and HT-2 toxins. A double sample extraction with a phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and methanol was used for co-extraction of mycotoxins, and a multifunctional immunoaffinity column was used for cleanup. Optimum conditions for separation of the mycotoxins were obtained to separate 12 mycotoxins in FLD and PDA chromatograms with a high resolution. The method gave recoveries in the range 72-111% when applied to spiked corn samples. The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.025 ng/g for AFB(1) and AFG(1), 0.012 ng/g for AFB(2) and AFG(2), 0.2 ng/g for OTA, 1.5 ng/g for ZEA, 6.2 ng/g for FB(1), FB(3) and HT-2 toxin, 9.4 ng/g for FB(2) and T-2 toxin, and 18.7 ng/g for DON. In addition, the limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0.04 ng/g for AFB(2) and AFG(2) to 62 ng/g for DON.

21220762,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) possess significant phytase activity in the mature grains. Maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) possess little or virtually no preformed phytase activity in the mature grain and depend fully on de novo synthesis during germination. Here, it is demonstrated that wheat, barley, maize, and rice all possess purple acid phosphatase (PAP) genes that, expressed in Pichia pastoris, give fully functional phytases (PAPhys) with very similar enzyme kinetics. Preformed wheat PAPhy was localized to the protein crystalloid of the aleurone vacuole. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that PAPhys possess four conserved domains unique to the PAPhys. In barley and wheat, the PAPhy genes can be grouped as PAPhy_a or PAPhy_b isogenes (barley, HvPAPhy_a, HvPAPhy_b1, and HvPAPhy_b2; wheat, TaPAPhy_a1, TaPAPhy_a2, TaPAPhy_b1, and TaPAPhy_b2). In rice and maize, only the b type (OsPAPhy_b and ZmPAPhy_b, respectively) were identified. HvPAPhy_a and HvPAPhy_b1/b2 share 86% and TaPAPhya1/a2 and TaPAPhyb1/b2 share up to 90% (TaPAPhy_a2 and TaPAPhy_b2) identical amino acid sequences. despite of this, PAPhy_a and PAPhy_b isogenes are differentially expressed during grain development and germination. In wheat, it was demonstrated that a and b isogene expression is driven by different promoters (approximately 31% identity). TaPAPhy_a/b promoter reporter gene expression in transgenic grains and peptide mapping of TaPAPhy purified from wheat bran and germinating grains confirmed that the PAPhy_a isogene set present in wheat/barley but not in rice/maize is the origin of high phytase activity in mature grains.",Plant physiology,"['D010832', 'D000135', 'D000595', 'D003001', 'D018076', 'D015971', 'D018506', 'D018525', 'D006023', 'D001467', 'D007700', 'D008969', 'D012275', 'D010802', 'D010944', 'D012639', 'D016415', 'D053719', 'D013997', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['6-Phytase', 'Acid Phosphatase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Germination', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hordeum', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oryza', 'Phylogeny', 'Plants', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Time Factors', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']","Cloning and characterization of purple acid phosphatase phytases from wheat, barley, maize, and rice.","['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000201', 'Q000166', None, None, None, 'Q000166', 'Q000201']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'genetics', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'enzymology', None, None, 'enzymology', None, 'enzymology', 'cytology', None, None, None, 'cytology', 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21220762,2011

The samples were extracted with aqueous acetonitrile (84 : 16, v/v) and purified by reliable laboratory-made mixed cartridges.

All mycotoxins were detected with a Waters Micromass Quattro Ultima Pt tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in negative electrospray ionization using multiple reaction monitoring mode. Accurate determination was achieved by employing commercial ¹³C₁₅-deoxynivalenol as internal standard, which compensated for target loss and eliminated matrix effects. The established method was further validated by determining the linearity (R² > 0.9990), average recovery (75.8-106.5%), sensitivity (limit of quantitation 0.09-8.48 µg kg⁻¹) and precision (relative standard deviation ≤ 6.9%).

20728087,"A sensitive and reliable liquid chromatography/photoionization (APPI) tandem mass spectrometry method has been developed for determining nine selected mycotoxins in wheat and maize samples. The analytes were chosen on the basis of the mycotoxins under EU Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006, i.e., deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZON), aflatoxins (AFs), and ochratoxin A (OTA), and considering the possibility of a near future regulation for T-2 and HT-2 toxins. Mycotoxins were extracted from samples by means of an one-step solvent extraction without any cleanup. The developed multi-mycotoxin method permits simultaneous, simple, and rapid determination of several co-existing toxins separated in a single chromatographic run, in which AFs, T-2 and HT-2 toxin are acquired in positive, while OTA, DON and ZON in negative mode. Although a moderate signal suppression was noticeable, matrix effect did not give significant differences at p=0.05. Then, calibration in standard solution were used for quantitation. Based on the EU Commission Decision 2002/657/EC, the method was in-house validated in terms of ruggedness, specificity, linearity, trueness, within-laboratory reproducibility, decision limit (CCalpha) and detection capability (CCbeta). For all the analytes, the regression coefficient r ranged between 0.8752 (DON in wheat) and 0.9465 (ZON in maize), biases related to mean concentrations were from -13% to +12% of the nominal spiking level, and the overall within-laboratory reproducibility ranged 3-16%; finally, CCalpha values did not differ more than 20% and CCbeta not more than 42% from their respective maximum limit.

Biofortification of major staple crops (wheat [Triticum aestivum], rice [Oryza sativa], maize [Zea mays], and potato [Solanum tuberosum]) with β-carotene has the potential to alleviate this nutritional problem. Previously, we engineered transgenic ""Golden"" potato tubers overexpressing three bacterial genes for β-carotene synthesis (CrtB, CrtI, and CrtY, encoding phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, and lycopene β-cyclase, respectively) and accumulating the highest amount of β-carotene in the four aforementioned crops. Here, we report the systematic quantitation of carotenoid metabolites and transcripts in 24 lines carrying six different transgene combinations under the control of the 35S and Patatin (Pat) promoters. Low levels of B-I expression are sufficient for interfering with leaf carotenogenesis, but not for β-carotene accumulation in tubers and calli, which requires high expression levels of all three genes under the control of the Pat promoter. Tubers expressing the B-I transgenes show large perturbations in the transcription of endogenous carotenoid genes, with only minor changes in carotenoid content, while the opposite phenotype (low levels of transcriptional perturbation and high carotenoid levels) is observed in Golden (Y-B-I) tubers. We used hierarchical clustering and pairwise correlation analysis, together with a new method for network correlation analysis, developed for this purpose, to assess the perturbations in transcript and metabolite levels in transgenic leaves and tubers. Through a ""guilt-by-profiling"" approach, we identified several endogenous genes for carotenoid biosynthesis likely to play a key regulatory role in Golden tubers, which are candidates for manipulations aimed at the further optimization of tuber carotenoid content.",Plant physiology,"['D002851', 'D016000', 'D053263', 'D053858', 'D010641', 'D035281', 'D030821', 'D011401', 'D011198', 'D019076', 'D019207']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Tubers', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Transgenes', 'beta Carotene']",Transcriptional-metabolic networks in beta-carotene-enriched potato tubers: the long and winding road to the Golden phenotype.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000096']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'genetics', None, 'biosynthesis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20671108,2011

20491474,"Soybean and maize are extensively used in animal feed, primarily in poultry, swine, and cattle diets. Soybean meal can affect pig performance in the first few weeks following weaning and elicit specific antibodies in weaned piglets. Though maize is a major component of pig feed, it is not known if any of the maize proteins can elicit immunological response in young pigs. In this study, we have identified a prominent 27 kDa protein from maize as an immunodominant protein in young pigs. This protein, like some known allergens, exhibited resistance to pepsin digestion in vitro. Several lines of evidence identify the immunodominant 27 kDa protein as a gamma-zein, a maize seed storage protein. First, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of different solubility classes of maize seed proteins revealed the presence of an abundant 27 kDa protein in the prolamin (zein) fraction. Antibodies raised against the purified maize 27 kDa gamma-zein also reacted against the same protein recognized by the young pig serum. Additionally, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the peptides generated by trypsin digestion of the immunodominant 27 kDa protein showed significant homology to the maize 27 kDa gamma-zein.

Among Fusarium toxins, deoxynivalenol (DON) is considered the most important contaminant in wheat due to its widespread occurrence. In the last years the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Commission have frequently expressed opinions on Fusarium toxins, setting limits, regulations and guidelines in order to reduce their levels in raw materials and food commodities. In particular, European legislation (Reg. 1881/2006) sets the maximum limit for DON in flour and bread as 750 and 500 microg kg(-1) respectively. Relatively few studies have taken into account the loss of trichothecenes during processing, focusing on how processing factors may influence their degradation. In particular, the description of DON behaviour during bread-making is very difficult, since complex physico-chemical modifications occur during the transformation of the raw ingredients into the final product. In the present study, we studied how DON concentration may be influenced by modifying bread-making parameters, with a special emphasis on the fermentation and baking stages, starting from a naturally contaminated flour at both pilot and industrial scales. Exploiting the power of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to consider the great complexity of the studied system, the obtained model shows satisfying goodness-of-fit and prediction, suggesting that the baking step (time/temperature ranges) is crucial for minimizing native DON level in bread.","Food additives & contaminants.

20299027,"The synthesis of a T-2 toxin imprinted polymer and its application in food analysis are reported for the first time. A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for the selective recognition of T-2 toxin (T-2) was synthesized by bulk polymerization. Methacrylamide and ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate were applied as functional monomer and cross-linker, respectively. Molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedures were optimized for further application in the analysis of T-2. Scatchard plot analysis revealed that two classes of imprinted binding sites were formed in the imprinted polymer. The dissociation constant (KD) of the higher affinity binding sites was 7.0 micromol/l, while the KD of the lower affinity binding sites was 54.7 micromol/l. The performance of the MIP throughout the clean-up of spiked maize, barley and oat sample extracts was compared with the results obtained when using non-imprinted polymer, OASIS HLB and immunoaffinity columns (IAC). Depending on the food matrix and the spiked concentration, recoveries after MISPE and non-imprinted solid-phase extraction varied respectively from 60% to 73% and from 21% to 57%. Recoveries obtained after clean-up using OASIS HLB and IAC were in the range of 74-104% and 60-85%, respectively. Although highest recoveries were obtained with OASIS HLB sorbents, the designed MIP and the IAC were superior regarding selectivity, cross-reactivity, matrix effect, limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ). Depending on the matrix, LOD after MISPE ranged from 0.4 microg/kg to 0.6 microg/kg and LOQ from 1.4 microg/kg to 1.9 microg/kg. LOD and LOQ after OASIS HLB clean-up varied from 0.9 microg/kg to 3.5 microg/kg and from 3.1 microg/kg to 11.7 microg/kg, respectively. The LOD and LOQ values obtained with IAC were in the range of 0.3-2.3 microg/kg and 1.0-7.7 microg/kg, respectively.

20221935,"The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between fluorescence emissions of corn kernels inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and aflatoxin contamination levels within the kernels. Aflatoxin contamination in corn has been a long-standing problem plaguing the grain industry with potentially devastating consequences to corn growers. In this study, aflatoxin-contaminated corn kernels were produced through artificial inoculation of corn ears in the field with toxigenic A. flavus spores. The kernel fluorescence emission data were taken with a fluorescence hyperspectral imaging system when corn kernels were excited with ultraviolet light. Raw fluorescence image data were preprocessed and regions of interest in each image were created for all kernels. The regions of interest were used to extract spectral signatures and statistical information. The aflatoxin contamination level of single corn kernels was then chemically measured using affinity column chromatography. A fluorescence peak shift phenomenon was noted among different groups of kernels with different aflatoxin contamination levels. The fluorescence peak shift was found to move more toward the longer wavelength in the blue region for the highly contaminated kernels and toward the shorter wavelengths for the clean kernels. Highly contaminated kernels were also found to have a lower fluorescence peak magnitude compared with the less contaminated kernels. It was also noted that a general negative correlation exists between measured aflatoxin and the fluorescence image bands in the blue and green regions. The correlation coefficients of determination, r(2), was 0.72 for the multiple linear regression model. The multivariate analysis of variance found that the fluorescence means of four aflatoxin groups, <1, 1-20, 20-100, and >or=100 ng g(-1) (parts per billion), were significantly different from each other at the 0.01 level of alpha. Classification accuracy under a two-class schema ranged from 0.84 to 0.91 when a threshold of either 20 or 100 ng g(-1) was used. Overall, the results indicate that fluorescence hyperspectral imaging may be applicable in estimating aflatoxin content in individual corn kernels.","Food additives & contaminants.

20213172,"This paper describes a method for determination of 27 mycotoxins and other secondary metabolites in maize silage. The method focuses on analytes which are known to be produced by common maize and maize-silage contaminants. A simple pH-buffered sample extraction was developed on the basis of a very fast and simple method for analysis of multiple pesticide residues in food known as QuEChERS. The buffering effectively ensured a stable pH in samples of both well-ensiled maize (pH < 4) and of hot spots with fungal infection (pH > 7). No further clean-up was performed before analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was successfully validated for determination of eight analytes qualitatively and 19 quantitatively. Matrix-matched calibration standards were used giving recoveries ranging from 37% to 201% with the majority between 60% and 115%. Repeatability (5-27% RSD(r)) and intra-laboratory reproducibility (7-35% RSD(IR)) was determined. The limit of detection (LOD) for the quantitatively validated analytes ranged from 1 to 739 microg kg(-1). Validation results for citrinin, fumonisin B(1) and fumonisin B(2) were unsatisfying.

20207360,"A novel, cost-efficient method for the analytical extraction of the Fusarium mycotoxin zearalenone (ZON) from edible oils by dynamic covalent hydrazine chemistry (DCHC) was developed and validated for its application with high performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). ZON is extracted from the edible oil by hydrazone formation on a polymer resin functionalised with hydrazine groups and subsequently released by hydrolysis. Specifity and precision of this approach are superior to liquid partitioning or gel permeation chromatography (GPC). DCHC also extracts zearalanone (ZAN) but not alpha-/beta-zearalenol or -zearalanol. The hydrodynamic properties of ZON, which were estimated using molecular simulation data, indicate that the compound is unaffected by nanofiltration through the resin pores and thus selectively extracted. The method's levels of detection and quantification are 10 and 30 microg/kg, using 0.2g of sample. Linearity is given in the range of 10-20,000 microg/kg, the average recovery being 89%. Bias and relative standard deviations do not exceed 7%. In a sample survey of 44 commercial edible oils based on various agricultural commodities (maize, olives, nuts, seeds, etc.) ZON was detected in four maize oil samples, the average content in the positive samples being 99 microg/kg.

20118365,"Zearalenone (ZON) is a potent estrogenic mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium species most frequently on maize and therefore can be found in food and animal feed. Since animal production performance is negatively affected by the presence of ZON, its detoxification in contaminated plant material or by-products of bioethanol production would be advantageous. Microbial biotransformation into nontoxic metabolites is one promising approach. In this study the main transformation product of ZON formed by the yeast Trichosporon mycotoxinivorans was identified and characterized by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and LC-diode array detector (DAD) analysis. The metabolite, named ZOM-1, was purified, and its molecular formula, C(18)H(24)O(7), was established by time of flight MS (TOF MS) from the ions observed at m/z 351.1445 [M-H](-) and at m/z 375.1416 [M+Na](+).

The percentage of positive samples was as follows: FB1 41%, AF 51%, ZEA 57%, DON 65% and OTA 3%. High FB1 contents were found in maize, averaging 3,684 µg/kg (range: 37-24,225 µg/kg), whereas the highest average ZEA level was found in peanuts (70 µg/kg), followed by maize (69 µg/kg), rice (67 µg/kg) and beans (48 µg/kg) with no ZEA was detected in soybeans.

20102202,"Betaine and choline are important components of the one-carbon metabolism cycle, linked with the amino acid homocysteine and lipid metabolism. Analyses of broad ranges of foods point to cereal based foods being important sources of betaine and choline, however to date there has been no detailed analysis of these compounds in cereal flours or cereal products. An analytical method based on optimization of an existing extraction followed by LC-MS/MS analysis was used to analyze 47 plasma samples, 32 cereal flours and cereal fractions, and 51 cereal products. For the method validation LLOQ, recovery, inter- and intraday repeatability were all performed. Whole-grain wheat and rye flours, and products based on these were the best whole cereal sources of betaine (747-1508 microg/g) and to a lesser extent choline (76-159 microg/g), while the bran fraction contained the highest concentrations of betaine and free-choline (2350-2899 microg/g and 366-384 microg/g respectively). Refined wheat flour and products contained lower concentrations, while rice and maize contained only very low and no detectable amounts of betaine respectively (0-10 microg/g), and low amounts of free-choline (<31 microg/g). These results were mirrored in cereal products analyzed, with whole-grain wheat or rye-based cereal products having the highest concentrations of the two metabolites. Plasma concentrations for betaine and free-choline in a group of 47 subjects ranged from 15.2-66.3 and 9.8-18.5 micromol/L respectively, within the range of previous reports.

Monosaccharide disappearance data suggest that maize and rice bran arabinoxylans are fermented by a debranching mechanism, while wheat bran arabinoxylans likely contain large unsubstituted xylose regions that are fermented preferentially, followed by poor fermentation of the remaining, highly branched oligosaccharides.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000468', 'D004043', 'D004063', 'D005232', 'D005243', 'D005285', 'D006801', 'D007420', 'D008954', 'D012275', 'D012995', 'D014908', 'D014990', 'D003313']","['Alkalies', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Digestion', 'Fatty Acids, Volatile', 'Feces', 'Fermentation', 'Humans', 'Intestine, Large', 'Models, Biological', 'Oryza', 'Solubility', 'Triticum', 'Xylans', 'Zea mays']","Structural differences among alkali-soluble arabinoxylans from maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum) brans influence human fecal fermentation profiles.","['Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20000566,2010

19926802,"Grass species represent a major source of food, feed, and fiber crops and potential feedstocks for biofuel production. Most of the biomass is contributed by cell walls that are distinct in composition from all other flowering plants. Identifying cell wall-related genes and their functions underpins a fundamental understanding of growth and development in these species. Toward this goal, we are building a knowledge base of the maize (Zea mays) genes involved in cell wall biology, their expression profiles, and the phenotypic consequences of mutation. Over 750 maize genes were annotated and assembled into gene families predicted to function in cell wall biogenesis. Comparative genomics of maize, rice (Oryza sativa), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) sequences reveal differences in gene family structure between grass species and a reference eudicot species. Analysis of transcript profile data for cell wall genes in developing maize ovaries revealed that expression within families differed by up to 100-fold. When transcriptional analyses of developing ovaries before pollination from Arabidopsis, rice, and maize were contrasted, distinct sets of cell wall genes were expressed in grasses. These differences in gene family structure and expression between Arabidopsis and the grasses underscore the requirement for a grass-specific genetic model for functional analyses. A UniformMu population proved to be an important resource in both forward- and reverse-genetics approaches to identify hundreds of mutants in cell wall genes. A forward screen of field-grown lines by near-infrared spectroscopic screen of mature leaves yielded several dozen lines with heritable spectroscopic phenotypes.

Samples included baby food (n = 62), corn flour (11), cornflakes (23), pasta (14), cookies (17) and other corn products (59) were obtained from popular markets of Valencia (Spain) and Perugia (Italy). The analytical method used pressurized liquid extraction and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole (QqQ) analyser. Of the 104 Spanish samples, 22% contained levels in the range of 2-449 µg kg(-1), 2-229 µg kg(-1) and 6-105 µg kg(-1) for FB1, FB2 and FB3, respectively, while 19 (23%) of the 82 Italian samples were positive with quantifiable levels between 2-235 µg kg(-1), 3-187 µg kg(-1), and 4-40 µg kg(-1) for fumonisins B1, B2 and B3, respectively. Overall, none of the Italian samples and only one organic baby food sample from a Spanish market was above the maximum permitted levels established by European legislation.

Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) was used as a template molecule. A molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedure was developed for further application in the analysis of FB. The performance of the MIP throughout the clean-up of spiked bell pepper, rice and corn flake sample extracts was compared with the results obtained when using non-imprinted polymer, C(18), strong anion exchange and immunoaffinity sorbents. Extracts were analysed for FB with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after clean-up. Depending on the food matrix and the concentration range of the fumonisins, recoveries after MISPE varied from 62 to 86%, from 62 to 83%, and from 67 to 81% for fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)), fumonisin B(2) (FB(2)) and fumonisin B(3) (FB(3)), respectively. The selectivity of the synthesized MIP for mycotoxins belonging to the group of FB was confirmed by evaluating cross-reactivity from analogue structures and other mycotoxins. Analysis of 39 naturally contaminated samples (corn flakes) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry indicated that the synthesized MIP could be an excellent alternative for clean-up and pre-concentration of FB in food samples. Pearson correlations between immunoaffinity clean-up and MISPE were calculated and amounted to 0.923 for FB(1), 0.808 for FB(2), and 0.759 for FB(3).

(Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and Zabrotes subfasciatus Boheman (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). One alpha-amylase was isolated from whole larval midguts of T. molitor using non-denaturing SDS-PAGE, while two other alpha-amylase fractions were isolated from whole larval midguts of Z. subfasciatus using hydrophobic interaction chromatography., Digested starch granules from larvae fed on maize, potato or wheat were isolated from midgut contents. Combinations of starch granules with isolated alpha-amylases from both species showed similar patterns of granule degradation. In vitro enzymatic degradation of maize starch granules by the three different alpha-amylase fractions began by creating small holes and crater-like areas on the surface of the granules. Over time, these holes increased in number and area resulting in extensive degradation of the granule structure. Granules from potato did not show formation of pits and craters on their surface, but presented extensive erosion in their interior. For all types of starch, as soon as the interior of the starch granule was reached, the inner layers of amylose and amylopectin were differentially hydrolyzed, resulting in a striated pattern. These data support the hypothesis that the pattern of starch degradation depends more on the granule type than on the alpha-amylase involved.",Journal of insect science (Online),"['D000818', 'D004063', 'D007814', 'D008855', 'D011198', 'D013213', 'D013712', 'D014908', 'D048889', 'D003313']","['Animals', 'Digestion', 'Larva', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Starch', 'Tenebrio', 'Triticum', 'Weevils', 'Zea mays']","Digestion of starch granules from maize, potato and wheat by larvae of the the yellow mealworm, Tenebrio molitor and the Mexican bean weevil, Zabrotes subfasciatus.","[None, 'Q000502', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000502', 'Q000737', 'Q000502', 'Q000737']","[None, 'physiology', 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'physiology', 'chemistry', 'physiology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619014,2009

The fractions were isolated from soils, either continuously with a C(3) wheat (soil (13)C value = -26.4 per thousand), or transferred to a C(4) maize (soil (13)C value = -20.2 per thousand) cropping system 23 years ago. Pyrograms contained up to 45 different pyrolysis peaks; 37 (ca. 85%) were identifiable compounds. Lignins and carbohydrates dominated the POM fractions, proteins were abundant, but lignin was (nearly) absent in the silt and clay fractions. The mean turnover time (MRT) for the pyrolysis products in particulate organic matter (POM) was generally <15 years (fast C pool) and 20-300 years (medium or slow C pools) in silt and clay fractions. Methylcyclopentenone (carbohydrate) in the clay fraction and benzene (mixed source) in the silt fraction exhibited the longest MRTs, 297 and 159 years, respectively. Plant-derived organic matter was not stored in soils, but was transformed to microbial remains, mainly in the form of carbohydrates and proteins and held in soil by organo-mineral interactions. Selective preservation of plant-derived OM (i.e. lignin) based on chemical recalcitrance was not observed in these arable soils. Association/presence of C with silt or clays in soils clearly increased MRT values, but in an as yet unresolved manner (i.e. 'truly' stabilized, or potentially still 'labile' but just not accessible C).",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D002247', 'D009930', 'D010316', 'D012987', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Carbon Isotopes', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Particle Size', 'Soil', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Molecular turnover time of soil organic matter in particle-size fractions of an arable soil.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19603490,2009
19572519,"In this study, a combination of autoclave and beta-amylolysis was used to modulate the digestibility of normal corn starch (NCS) and wheat starch (WS). The modification procedure comprised three cycles of autoclave at 35% moisture content and 121 degrees C, beta-amylolysis, and one additional cycle of autoclave. Starch materials were sampled at each stage and characterized. The fine structure of starch was determined using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography, the micromorphology of starch dispersion was imaged using cryo-SEM, the crystalline pattern was evaluated using wide-angle X-ray powder diffraction, and the digestibility was measured using Englyst assay. After beta-amylolysis, amylose was enriched (from 25.4 to 33.2% for NCS and from 27.5 to 32.8% for WS) and the branch density was increased (from 5.2 to 7.7% for NCS and from 5.3 to 7.9% for WS). Cryo-SEM images showed that the autoclave treatment led to the formation of a low-swelling, high-density gel network, whereas beta-amylolysis nearly demolished the network structure. The loss of A-type crystalline structure and the formation of B- and V-type structures resulted from autoclave, which suggests the formation of amylose-based ordered structure. Englyst assay indicated that, due to beta-amylolysis, the resistant starch (RS) content was increased to 30 from 11% of native NCS and to 23 from 9% of native WS. In contrast, autoclave showed only minor impact on RS levels.

19493973,"Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4B is known to interact with multiple initiation factors, mRNA, rRNA, and poly(A) binding protein (PABP). To gain a better understanding of the function of eIF4B, the two isoforms from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were expressed and analyzed using biophysical and biochemical methods. Plant eIF4B was found by ultracentrifugation and light scattering analysis to most likely be a monomer with an extended structure. An extended structure would facilitate the multiple interactions of eIF4B with mRNA as well as other initiation factors (eIF4A, eIF4G, PABP, and eIF3). Eight mRNAs, barley (Hordeum vulgare) alpha-amylase mRNA, rabbit beta-hemoglobin mRNA, Arabidopsis heat shock protein 21 (HSP21) mRNA, oat (Avena sativa) globulin, wheat (Triticum aestivum) germin, maize (Zea mays) alcohol dehydrogenase, satellite tobacco necrosis virus RNA, and alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) 4, were used in wheat germ in vitro translation assays to measure their dependence on eIF4B and eIF4F isoforms. The two Arabidopsis eIF4B isoforms, as well as native and recombinant wheat eIF4B, showed similar responses in the translation assay. AMV RNA 4 and Arabidopsis HSP21 showed only a slight dependence on the presence of eIF4B isoforms, whereas rabbit beta-hemoglobin mRNA and wheat germin mRNA showed modest dependence. Barley alpha-amylase, oat globulin, and satellite tobacco necrosis virus RNA displayed the strongest dependence on eIF4B. These results suggest that eIF4B has some effects on mRNA discrimination during initiation of translation. Barley alpha-amylase, oat globulin, and rabbit beta-hemoglobin mRNA showed the highest activity with eIF4F, whereas Arabidopsis HSP21 and AMV RNA 4 used both eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F equally well. These results suggest that differential or optimal translation of mRNAs may require initiation complexes composed of specific isoforms of initiation factor gene products. Thus, individual mRNAs or classes of mRNAs may respond to the relative abundance of a particular initiation factor(s), which in turn may affect the amount of protein translated. It is likely that optimal multifactor initiation complexes exist that allow for optimal translation of mRNAs under a variety of cellular conditions.",Plant physiology,"['D000906', 'D017360', 'D001681', 'D015153', 'D002850', 'D003001', 'D004591', 'D039562', 'D039642', 'D014644', 'D008027', 'D008970', 'D014176', 'D020033', 'D012333', 'D012542', 'D016415', 'D014908', 'D014461']","['Antibodies', 'Arabidopsis', 'Biological Assay', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'Genetic Variation', 'Light', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Triticum', 'Ultracentrifugation']","Evidence for variation in the optimal translation initiation complex: plant eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF(iso)4F differentially promote translation of mRNAs.","[None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000276', None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'immunology', None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'genetics', None, None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19493973,2009
19485209,"Following previous observations of apparent instability of fumonisin B1 in corn starch and corn meal, immunoaffinity column (IAC) cleanup, of the type used in the analysis of commercial starch-containing corn foods for fumonisins, was investigated. Foods analyzed for naturally occurring fumonisins B1, B2, and B3 included corn flour (3 different products), corn meal, and corn flakes. In 2 series of experiments, fractions were eluted by gravity or vacuum from narrow- or wide-bore Fumonitest IACs either with 2 x 2 mL methanol, followed by 2 mL methanol-water (8 + 2, v/v), or with 2 mL methanol, then 2 mL methanol-water (8 + 2, v/v). The ratio (%) of fumonisin B1 concentration in the first methanol eluate to the total concentration measured from all eluates in most cases varied from 25-70%. Incomplete recoveries were also observed for fumonisins B2 and B3. It is concluded that there can be a major underestimation of naturally occurring fumonisins in methods using only methanol elution for IAC cleanup, as in AOAC INTERNATIONAL Official Method 2001.04 (accuracy of these methods had been determined only by spiking the food with fumonisins). Elution with 2 x 2 mL methanol-water (8 + 2, v/v) was chosen as a practical procedure; means of 81-98% of the total fumonisin B1 concentration were found in the first eluate, except for corn flakes and 2 experiments with corn meal.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002846', 'D002851', 'D005506', 'D037341', 'D000432', 'D012997', 'D014867', 'D003313']","['Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Fumonisins', 'Methanol', 'Solvents', 'Water', 'Zea mays']",Incomplete recoveries of fumonisins present in naturally contaminated corn foods from an immunoaffinity column.,"['Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000302', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['methods', None, 'analysis', 'isolation & purification', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19485209,2009

19437441,"A rapid multianalyte-multiclass method with little sample manipulation has been developed for the simultaneous determination of eleven mycotoxins in different food commodities by using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS). Toxins were extracted from the samples with acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v) 0.1% HCOOH and, after a two-fold dilution with water, directly injected into the system. Thanks to the fast high-resolution separation of UHPLC, the eleven mycotoxins were separated by gradient elution in only 4 min. The method has been validated in three food matrices (maize kernels, dry pasta (wheat), and eight-multicereal babyfood (wheat, maize, rice, oat, barley, rye, sorghum, millet)) at four different concentration levels. Satisfactory recoveries were obtained (70-110%) and precision (expressed as relative standard deviation) was typically below 15% with very few exceptions. Quantification of samples was carried out with matrix-matched standards calibration. The lowest concentration successfully validated in sample was as low as 0.5 microg/kg for aflatoxins and ochratoxin A in babyfood, and 20 microg/kg for the rest of the selected mycotoxins in all matrices tested. Deoxynivalenol could be only validated at 200 microg/kg, due the poor sensitivity for this mycotoxin analysis. With only two exceptions (HT-2 and deoxynivalenol), the limits of detection (LODs), estimated for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 from the chromatograms of samples spiked at the lowest level validated, varied between 0.1 and 1 microg/kg in the three food matrices tested.

Syntheses of fluorescein-labeled ZEN tracers containing three linkers of different lengths (2, 3 and 6-carbon bridge), ethylenediamine, 1,2-diaminopropane and hexamethylenediamine, were explored and their binding response with ZEN-specific antibody was evaluated. A fluoresceinthiocarbamyl hexamethylenediamine-labeled ZEN conjugate (ZEN-HMDF), which contain a 6-carbon bridge, was found to be the most sensitive FPIA for detection of ZEN. When tested on corn matrix the FPIA using the ZEN-HMDF tracer showed a detection range for ZEN of 150-1000 microg kg(-1) with a detection limit of 137 microg kg(-1), and required less than 2 min per sample to carry out, excluding extraction time. The average recovery from spiked corn samples was 106.4+/-12.5%. Comparative analyses of 70 naturally occurring cereals and their products using FPIA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the coefficients of determination (r(2)) between FPIA and ELISA, and between FPIA and HPLC were 0.76 and 0.72, respectively.

The RS percentages in the native starch (NS) of 1-4 were 55.2, 1.1, 5.7, and 1.1%, respectively. All NS were evaluated for pasting properties with a rapid viscoanalyzer (RVA) and for thermal properties with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). NS 1 had a low peak viscosity (PV) caused by incomplete gelatinization, whereas NS 3 had the greatest PV and breakdown of all four starch types. On the DSC, NS 2 had the lowest onset temperature and greatest enthalpy. NS 1 and 3 had similar onset and peak temperatures, both higher than those of NS 2 and 4. The gel strength of NS heated with a RVA was evaluated by using a texture analyzer immediately after RVA heating (fresh, RVA-F) and after the gel had been stored at 4 degrees C for 10 days (retrograded, RVA-R). NS 1 gel was watery and had the lowest strength (30 g) among starch gel types. NS 3 gel, although exhibiting syneresis, had greater gel strength than NS 2 and 4. The structures of the NS, the RS isolated from the NS (RS-NS), the RS isolated from RVA-F (RS-RVA-F), and the RS isolated from RVA-R (RS-RVA-R) were evaluated by using size exclusion chromatography. NS 1 had a greater percentage of amylose (AM) (58.3%) than the other NS (20.4-26.8%).

However, because of its limited production and of its relatively high price, some beekeepers or unscrupulous traders do not hesitate to modify and falsify this natural product in order to try to increase its market value. Then, these involved falsification practices, for example intentional addition of cheap sugar syrup to honeys, are sometimes difficult to detect. An effective and simple analytical method is proposed in order to detect adulteration in honey by analysis of polysaccharide profiles. Samples were previously treated with reversed-phase solid phase extraction first to remove monosaccharides and small oligosaccharides and second to concentrate simultaneously traces of polysaccharides. A chromatographic separation using anion exchange stationary phase and pulse amperometric detection was further performed. Polysaccharide fingerprints (degree of polymerization from 11 to 17) were shown to be present in laboratory doped samples, and not detectable or present at very low concentrations in the authentic honey samples.

This study tested the interdependence of the maize enzymes starch synthase IIa (SSIIa), SSIII, starch branching enzyme IIb (SBEIIb), and SBEIIa for assembly into multisubunit complexes. Mutations that eliminated any one of those proteins also prevented the others from assembling into a high molecular mass form of approximately 670 kD, so that SSIII, SSIIa, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb most likely all exist together in the same complex. SSIIa, SBEIIb, and SBEIIa, but not SSIII, were also interdependent for assembly into a complex of approximately 300 kD. SSIII, SSIIa, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb copurified through successive chromatography steps, and SBEIIa, SBEIIb, and SSIIa coimmunoprecipitated with SSIII in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.

Six variants per species were used, each with a different concentration level of PFOA and PFOS (from 0.25 to 50 mg/kg as aqueous solution) to detect possible concentration dependence in the transfer of these two PFCs from soil to plant. PFOA and PFOS were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after appropriate sample preparation (partial drying, mincing, homogenizing, extraction). Since PFOA and PFOS presently represent the most widely studied PFCs, they are classified as ""leading compounds."" The results show that concentrations of PFOA/PFOS in the plants vary greatly, depending on the concentrations applied to the soil. PFOA values were higher than PFOS values in all plants except potatoes, in which these differences could be quite substantial. From the results presented here it can be seen that uptake and storage are much more intensive in the vegetative portion of the plant than relocation in the storage organs. This is particularly evident from the the comparison of concentrations found in the grain and ear and those in the straw or rest of the plant in spring wheat, oats, and maize. Transfer from ""soil to crops"" provides a possible explanation for the presence of PFCs in foodstuffs and in human body fluids such as blood, plasma, serum, or breast milk.

19020997,"The compositional quality of different lignocellulosic feedstocks influences their performance and potential demand at a biorefinery. Many analytical protocols for determining the composition or performance characteristics of biomass involve a drying step, where the drying temperature can vary depending on the specific protocol. To get reliable data, it is important to determine the correct drying temperature to vaporize the water without negatively impacting the compositional quality of the biomass. A comparison of drying temperatures between 45 degrees C and 100 degrees C was performed using wheat straw and corn stover. Near-infrared (NIR) spectra were taken of the dried samples and compared using principal component analysis (PCA). Carbohydrates were analyzed using quantitative saccharification to determine sugar degradation. Analysis of variance was used to determine if there was a significant difference between drying at different temperatures. PCA showed an obvious separation in samples dried at different temperatures due to sample water content. However, quantitative saccharification data shows, within a 95% confidence interval, that there is no significant difference in sugar content for drying temperatures up to 100 degrees C for wheat straw and corn stover.",Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,"['D018533', 'D001709', 'D002241', 'D018547', 'D025341', 'D013055', 'D013696', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Biomass', 'Biotechnology', 'Carbohydrates', 'Plant Stems', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Temperature', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",The effect of drying temperature on the composition of biomass.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19020997,2009

Twenty-four dairy farms were visited twice and samples taken of all diet ingredients. Feed intake data were collected by means of questionnaires. A total of 169 feed samples were collected and analyzed for 20 mycotoxins using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry multimethod. Silage and compound feed were the main diet ingredients, representing on average 67 and 23% of dry matter intake, respectively. Deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid were the mycotoxins with the highest incidence. The incidence of DON in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 38 to 54%. The incidence of zearalenone in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 17 to 38%. The DON and zearalenone had a low incidence in forage samples and were not detected in ensiled by-product samples. Roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid were only detected in silage and ensiled by-product samples (incidence 7 to 19%). Fumonisins B(1) and B(2) were detected in 2 compound feed samples and one feed commodity sample. Aflatoxins B(1), B(2), G(1), and G(2), ochratoxin A, T-2 and HT-2 toxin, 3-acetyl-DON, 15-acetyl-DON, diacetoxyscirpenol, sterigmatocystin, fusarenon-X, ergotamine, and penicillinic acid were not detected in any of the samples. Average concentrations of DON, zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid in complete diets were 273, 28, 114, and 54 microg/kg, respectively. Maximum concentrations were 969, 203, 2,211, and 1,840 microg/kg, respectively. Calculated average daily intakes of these mycotoxins were 5.0, 0.5, 2.0, and 0.9 mg/animal, respectively, and maximum daily intakes 19.3, 3.5, 38.9, and 32.3 mg/animal, respectively. Corn silage was the major source of all 4 of these mycotoxins in the diet. Extremely high concentrations of roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid (up to 45 and 25 mg/kg, respectively) were detected in visibly molded areas in surface layers of corn silage. These areas appeared to be the main source of roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid in the diet. Because carry-over of DON, zearale-none, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid into milk is negligible, their occurrence in feedstuffs is not considered of significant concern with respect to the safety of dairy products for consumers.

The corresponding coding sequences were cloned, with heterologous expression in Escherichia coli used to confirm GST activity. Transcriptional profiling of these candidate GST genes and key anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway genes (PAL, CHS, DFR, and UFGT) in cell suspensions and grape berries against anthocyanin accumulation demonstrated strong positive correlation with two sequences, VvGST1 and VvGST4, respectively. The ability of VvGST1 and VvGST4 to transport anthocyanins was confirmed in the heterologous maize bronze-2 complementation model, providing further evidence for their function as anthocyanin transport proteins in grape cells.

18654797,"Grass lignins are differentiated from other lignin types by containing relatively large amounts of p-coumaric acid (pCA) acylating the C-9 position of lignin subunits. In the case of a mature corn (Zea mays L.) stems, pCA constitutes 15-18% of a dioxane soluble enzyme lignin. The major portion of the pCA is specifically attached to syringyl residues. Studies with isolated corn wall peroxidases show that pCA readily undergoes radical coupling in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, whereas sinapyl alcohol radical coupling proceeds more slowly. Analysis of corn wall peroxidases did not reveal specific enzymes that would lead to the preferred incorporation of sinapyl alcohol as seen in other plants. The addition of ethyl ferulate, methyl p-coumarate, or sinapyl p-coumarate conjugates to a reaction mixture containing peroxidase, sinapyl alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide stimulated the rate of sinapyl alcohol radical coupling by 10-20-fold. Based on spectral analysis it appears that pCA and ferulate radicals form rapidly, but the radical is readily transferred to sinapyl alcohol. The newly formed sinapyl alcohol radicals undergo coupling and cross-coupling reactions. However, sinapyl alcohol radicals do not cross-couple with pCA radicals. As long as hydrogen peroxide is limiting pCA remains uncoupled. Ferulates have similar reaction patterns in terms of radical transfer though they appear to cross-couple in the reaction mixture more readily then pCA. The role of pCA may be to internally provide a radical transfer mechanism for optimizing radical coupling of sinapyl alcohol into the growing lignin polymer. Attachment of some pCA to sinapyl alcohol ensures localization of the radical transfer mechanism in areas where sinapyl alcohol is being incorporated into lignin.",Planta,"['D002851', 'D003373', 'D005609', 'D008031', 'D008956', 'D010084', 'D010544', 'D010666', 'D010940', 'D018547', 'D011422', 'D003313']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Free Radicals', 'Lignin', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidases', 'Phenylpropionates', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Stems', 'Propionates', 'Zea mays']",A potential role for sinapyl p-coumarate as a radical transfer mechanism in grass lignin formation.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000737', 'Q000302', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18654797,2009

Quantification of DON was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. In contrast to immunoaffinity chromatography, in IUF the antibodies are not bound to a solid support material but used in free form, thus making it possible to avoid the critical immobilisation step. Sample clean-up by IUF proved to be as selective as clean-up using commercially available immunoaffinity columns.

Samples of Champús from 20 production sites in the Cauca Valley region were analysed. A total of 235 yeast isolates were identified by conventional microbiological analyses and by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2. The dominant species were: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Issatchenkia orientalis, Pichia fermentans, Pichia kluyveri var. kluyveri, Zygosaccharomyces fermentati, Torulospora delbruekii, Galactomyces geotrichum and Hanseniaspora spp. Model Champús systems were inoculated with single strains of some isolated sporogenus species and the aromatic profiles were analysed by SPME. Analysis of data showed that Champús strains produced high amounts of esters. The aromatic compounds produced by Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts from Champús can exert a relevant influence on the sensory characteristics of the fermented beverage.

The present investigation was made primarily to assess the genetic variability for nutritionally important traits in 87 elite maize inbreds representing major heterotic groups in China. Carotenoid and tocopherol fractions were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), whereas oil, starch, and protein contents were detected by a VECTER22/N near-infrared analyzer. Significant interactions between genotypes and years were observed for all the traits. The pooled mean values of beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and total carotenoids were 0.449, 0.876, 0.121, 5.803, 3.048, and 10.298 microg g (-1), respectively, whereas the combined mean performance of alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, and total tocopherols were 23.98, 32.90, 2.189, and 59.55 microg g (-1), respectively. The average protein, starch, and oil contents were observed to be 12.28, 64.51, and 3.55%, respectively. High level of heritability estimates were observed for all the traits and ranged from 65.6% (protein content) to 92.5% (alpha/gamma-tocopherol ratio). Most of the traits studied in this experiment were either significantly positive correlated or independent. The present finding exhibits substantial opportunities to the breeders for improvement of these traits in maize cultivars and also suggests further exploration of a new source of elite breeding stocks containing a high level of these nutritionally important compounds.

18608510,"A monoclonal antibody against zearalenone (ZEA) was produced and used successfully to develop a direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DC-ELISA) for the analysis of ZEA in cereals. This DC-ELISA had a limit of detection of 0.15 +/- 0.02 microg l(-1) and an IC50 value of 1.13 +/- 0.16 microg l(-1). Matrix interference was minimized by dilution of the sample extract before ELISA assays. Aqueous methanol (80%) gave good extraction efficiencies, and the recovery from spiked rice, barley, and corn samples averaged between 87 and 112%. Although ZEA was detected in seven (9%) of 80 rice samples and in eight (16%) of 50 barley samples, the concentration of ZEA in samples was around or below the limit of detection of DC-ELISA. Among 38 corn samples, ZEA was detected in nine (24%) samples in the range 41.0-909.8 microg kg(-1). Re-analysis of the ELISA-positive corn samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed that seven (18%) corn samples were positive. The ZEA results for corn showed very good agreement between DC-ELISA and a commercial AgraQant zearalenone kit (r2 = 0.98).

Fusarium verticillioides culture material (CM) was nixtamalized as is (NCM) or after mixing with ground corn (NCMC). Additional portions were sham nixtamalized without (SCM) or with corn (SCMC). Nixtamalization and sham nixtamalization reduced FB(1); CM, NCM, and SCM diets contained 9.08, 2.08, and 1.19 ppm, respectively.

Equivalent weights of the cooked products, uncooked CM, corn (UC) or nixtamalized UC (NUC) were fed to rats for up to three weeks. Kidney lesions in the NCM-fed group were less severe than in the CM-fed, positive control group and no lesions were found in the NCMC and other groups.

Deoxynivalenol (DON) was detected above the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 250 μg kg⁻¹ in 72% of maize and 10% of wheat silages. Average DON concentrations were 854 and 621 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, and maximum concentrations 3142 and 1165 μg kg⁻¹, respectively. Zearalenone was detected above the LOQ of 25 μg kg⁻¹ in 49% of maize and 6% of grass silages. Average zearalenone concentrations were 174 and 93 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, and maximum concentrations 943 and 308 μg kg⁻¹, respectively. The incidences and average concentrations of DON and zearalenone in maize silage were highest in 2004. The incidence of other mycotoxins was low: fumonisin B1 and 15-acetyl-DON were detected in 1.4 and 5% of maize silages, respectively, and roquefortin C in 0.8% of grass silages. None of the silages contained aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, T2-toxin, HT2-toxin, sterigmatocystin, diacetoxyscirpenol, fusarenon-X, ergotamine, penicillinic acid, or mycophenolic acid. This study demonstrates that maize silage is an important source of DON and zearalenone in the diet of dairy cattle. Since the carryover of these mycotoxins into milk is negligible, their occurrence in feed is not considered to be of significant concern with respect to the safety of dairy products for consumers.

These methods normally involve determination of single compounds only. EU legislation already exists for the aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and patulin in food, and legislation will come into force for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and the fumonisins in 2007. To enforce the various legal limits, it would be preferable to determine all mycotoxins by routine analysis in different types of matrices in one single extract. This would also be advantageous for HACCP control purposes. For this reason, a multi-method was developed with which 33 mycotoxins in various products could be analysed simultaneously. The mycotoxins were extracted with an acetonitrile/water mixture, diluted with water and then directly injected into a LC-MS/MS system. The mycotoxins were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and detected using an electrospray ionisation interface (ESI) and tandem MS, using MRM in the positive ion mode, to increase specificity for quality control. The following mycotoxins could be analysed in a single 30-min run: Aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, alpha-zearalenol, alpha-zearalanol, beta-zearalanol, sterigmatocystin, cyclopiazonic acid, penicillic acid, fumonisins B1, B2 and B3, diacetoxyscirpenol, 3- and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, zearalanone, ergotamin, ergocornin, ergocristin, alpha-ergocryptin, citrinin, roquefortin C, fusarenone X, nivalenol, mycophenolic acid, alternariol and alternariol monomethyl ether. The limit of quantification for the aflatoxins and ochratoxin A was 1.0 microg kg(-1) and for deoxynivalenol 50 microg kg(-1). The quantification limits for the other mycotoxins were in the range 10-200 microg kg(-1). The matrix effect and validation data are presented for between 13 and 24 mycotoxins in peanuts, pistachios, wheat, maize, cornflakes, raisins and figs. The method has been compared with the official EU method for the determination of aflatoxins in food and relevant FAPAS rounds. The multi-mycotoxin method has been proven by the detection of more than one mycotoxin in maize, buckwheat, figs and nuts. The LC-MS/MS technique has also been applied to baby food, which is subject to lower limits for aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A, ergot alkaloids in naturally contaminated rye and freeze-dried silage samples.","Food additives & contaminants.

18095437,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is an unavoidable food contaminant. To evaluate the potential health risk of AFB1 to Koreans posed by food consumption, we determined the natural occurrence of AFB1 in food and estimated the excess risk for liver cancer through dietary exposure to AFB1. A total of 694 food samples collected from six different regions of South Korea were analyzed for their AFB, content. One hundred four of the 694 samples were found to give positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) readings for AFB1 and were further investigated with high-performance liquid chromatography. Thirty-two samples, including 2 maize samples, 3 soybean products, 20 peanut samples, nut samples, and their products, and 7 spices, were found to be contaminated with AFB1 (4.6% incidence), up to 48.6 microg kg(-1). The level of AFB1 contamination in 28 of the 32 food products was below 10 microg kg(-1), which is the legal tolerance limit in Korea. From data on daily food consumption, the exposure dose of AFB1 was estimated to be 6.42 x 10(-7) mg kg(-1) body weight (bw) day(-1). The major contributors to the dietary intake of AFB1 were soybean paste and soy sauce, which composed 91% of the total exposure to AFB1. The excess risk of liver cancer for those exposed to AFB1 through food intake was estimated to be 5.78 x 10(-6) for hepatitis B-negative individuals and 1.48 x 10(-4) for hepatitis B-positive individuals.

18030664,"Lignans are phenylpropane dimers that are biosynthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway, in which pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase (PLR) catalyzes the last steps of lignan production. Our previous studies demonstrated that the contents of lignans in various wheat cultivars were significantly associated with anti-tumor activities in APC(Min) mice. To enhance lignan biosynthesis, this study was conducted to transform wheat cultivars ('Bobwhite', 'Madison', and 'Fielder', respectively) with the Forsythia intermedia PLR gene under the regulatory control of maize ubiquitin promoter. Of 24 putative transgenic wheat lines, we successfully obtained 3 transformants with the inserted ubiquitin-PLR gene as screened by PCR. Southern blot analysis further demonstrated that different copies of the PLR gene up to 5 were carried out in their genomes. Furthermore, a real-time PCR indicated approximately 17% increase of PLR gene expression over the control in 2 of the 3 positive transformants at T(0) generation. The levels of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, a prominent lignan in wheat as determined by HPLC-MS, were found to be 2.2-times higher in one of the three positive transgenic sub-lines at T(2 )than that in the wild-type (117.9 +/- 4.5 vs. 52.9 +/- 19.8 mug/g, p <0.005). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that elevated lignan levels in a transgenic wheat line has been successfully achieved through genetic engineering of over-expressed PLR gene.

17995633,"Purple corn (Zea mays L.) is a rich and economic source of anthocyanin colorants and functional ingredients. However, high levels of anthocyanin-rich waste are generated during processing, reducing the yields and increasing the costs of the final product. This waste has been associated with anthocyanin complexation with tannins and proteins. Our objective was to evaluate anthocyanin extraction methods to reduce purple corn waste. Different solvents (water, 0.01%-HCl-acidified water, and 0.01%-HCl-acidified ethanol), temperatures (room temperature, 50, 75, and 100 degrees C), and times of exposure to the solvents were investigated. Acetone (70% acetone in water) extraction was used as control. Anthocyanins, total phenolics, tannins, and proteins in extracts were measured by the pH differential, Folin-Ciocalteu, protein precipitation, and BCA assay methods. Qualitative analyses were done by HPLC coupled to a PDA detector and SDS-PAGE analysis. Water at 50 degrees C achieved the highest yield of anthocyanins (0.94 +/- 0.03 g per 100 g dry corncob) with relatively low tannins and proteins, comparable to the anthocyanin yield obtained by 70% acetone (0.98 +/- 0.08 g per 100 g dry corncob). Extending the extraction time from 20 to 60 min and using consecutive reextraction procedures reduced anthocyanin purity, increasing the yields of other phenolics. A neutral protease was applied to the extracts and effectively decomposed the major protein that was believed to contribute to the development of anthocyanin complexation and waste generation.

The method, using liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS/MS), allowed unambiguous identification of the selected trichothecenes at low microg per kg levels in such complex food matrices. A clean-up procedure, based on reversed phase SPE Oasis HLB columns, was used, allowing good recoveries for all studied trichothecenes. In particular, NIV recoveries significantly improved compared to those obtained by using Mycosep #227 columns for clean-up of the extracts. Limits of detection in the various investigated matrices ranged 2.5-4.0 microg kg(-1) for NIV, 2.8-5.3 microg kg(-1) for DON, 0.4-1.7 microg kg(-1) for HT-2 and 0.4-1.0 microg kg(-1) for T-2. Mean recovery values, obtained from cereals and cereal products spiked with NIV, DON, HT-2 and T-2 toxins at levels from 10 to 1000 microg kg(-1), ranged from 72 to 110% with mean relative standard deviation lower than 10%.

17760341,"The number of elevator facilities with laboratories to test shelled corn for aflatoxin on site is increasing. The inherent difficulty in accurately determining the true aflatoxin concentration of a lot of corn may have serious implications. Deviations from the true value are of even greater significance at busy locations where a high throughput is desired. This study was instituted to measure (1) the differences in aflatoxin test results between elevator laboratories and the Louisiana Agricultural Chemistry (LAC) laboratory and (2) the variability in aflatoxin test results associated with sampling, sample preparation, and analysis of shelled corn at such locations. One hundred lots of shelled corn from 10 elevators in Louisiana were analyzed for aflatoxin using the Aflatest method (at elevators and at the LAC laboratory) and high-performance column liquid chromatography (HPLC; LAC laboratory only). Mean aflatoxin levels determined at elevator laboratories were significantly (P < 0.05) lower from those obtained in the LAC laboratory using the Aflatest method. Overall, Aflatest method results were lower than those obtained by HPLC. This difference may be attributed to analyst technical dexterity, difficulty in providing careful attention to detail in a high throughput environment, and/or substandard facilities found at elevators. The total variance was partitioned into the combined sampling plus subsampling variance and analytical variance. The sampling and sample preparation steps accounted for about 91.5% of the total variability.

17618453,"Flavonoids are a large family of polyphenolic compounds with manifold functions in plants. Present in a wide range of vegetables and fruits, flavonoids form an integral part of the human diet and confer multiple health benefits. Here, we report on metabolic engineering of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathways in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) by overexpression of the maize (Zea mays L.) leaf colour (Lc) regulatory gene. The Lc gene was transferred into the M. domestica cultivar Holsteiner Cox via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation which resulted in enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in regenerated shoots. Five independent Lc lines were investigated for integration of Lc into the plant genome by Southern blot and PCR analyses. The Lc-transgenic lines contained one or two Lc gene copies and showed increased mRNA levels for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylase (FHT), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), leucoanthocyanidin reductases (LAR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR). HPLC-DAD and LC-MS analyses revealed higher levels of the anthocyanin idaein (12-fold), the flavan 3-ol epicatechin (14-fold), and especially the isomeric catechin (41-fold), and some distinct dimeric proanthocyanidins (7 to 134-fold) in leaf tissues of Lc-transgenic lines.

A test portion was extracted with methanol-water (80 + 20); the extract was filtered, diluted with phosphate-buffered saline solution, filtered on a microfiber glass filter, and applied to an immunoaffinity column. The column was washed with deionized water to remove interfering compounds, and the purified aflatoxin B1 was eluted with methanol. Aflatoxin B1 was separated and determined by reversed-phase LC with fluorescence detection after either pre- or postcolumn derivatization. Precolumn derivatization was achieved by generating the trifluoroacetic acid derivative, used by 8 laboratories. The postcolumn derivatization was achieved either with pyridinium hydrobromide perbromide, used by 16 laboratories, or with an electrochemical cell by the addition of bromide to the mobile phase, used by 5 laboratories.

17337530,"Based on the ability of phytosiderophores to chelate other heavy metals besides iron (Fe), phytosiderophores were suggested to prevent graminaceous plants from cadmium (Cd) toxicity. To assess interactions between Cd and phytosiderophore-mediated Fe acquisition, maize (Zea mays) plants were grown hydroponically under limiting Fe supply. Exposure to Cd decreased uptake rates of 59Fe(III)-phytosiderophores and enhanced the expression of the Fe-phytosiderophore transporter gene ZmYS1 in roots as well as the release of the phytosiderophore 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) from roots under Fe deficiency. However, DMA hardly mobilized Cd from soil or from a Cd-loaded resin in comparison to the synthetic chelators diaminetriaminepentaacetic acid and HEDTA. While nano-electrospray-high resolution mass spectrometry revealed the formation of an intact Cd(II)-DMA complex in aqueous solutions, competition studies with Fe(III) and zinc(II) showed that the formed Cd(II)-DMA complex was weak. Unlike HEDTA, DMA did not protect yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells from Cd toxicity but improved yeast growth in the presence of Cd when yeast cells expressed ZmYS1. When supplied with Fe-DMA as a Fe source, transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants expressing a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-ZmYS1 gene construct showed less growth depression than wild-type plants in response to Cd. These results indicate that inhibition of ZmYS1-mediated Fe-DMA transport by Cd is not related to Cd-DMA complex formation and that Cd-induced phytosiderophore release cannot protect maize plants from Cd toxicity. Instead, phytosiderophore-mediated Fe acquisition can improve Fe uptake in the presence of Cd and thereby provides an advantage under Cd stress relative to Fe acquisition via ferrous Fe.",Plant physiology,"['D000222', 'D002104', 'D017343', 'D007501', 'D008969', 'D017262', 'D021241', 'D017550', 'D003313']","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Cadmium', 'Genes, Plant', 'Iron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Siderophores', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Zea mays']",Iron acquisition by phytosiderophores contributes to cadmium tolerance.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000235']","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17337530,2007

Rice cultured with Fusarium graminearum and field mouldy corn infected by F. graminearum were extracted with methanol and found to contain 1.16 and 1.30 mg DON/g, respectively. The extracts were concentrated and then separated using a biphasic solvent system consisting of ethyl acetate-water (1:1, v/v). Collected fractions were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified by congruent retention time and UV/vis spectrum and mass spectrometric data. Fractions containing DON were combined and freeze-dried. This method produced 116 mg and 65 mg DON with a purity of greater than 94.9% from 200 g of the rice culture and the mouldy corn, respectively.

17292466,"Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of maize and wheat NADP-malic enzyme by KI and acrylamide was studied after denaturating proteins with guanidine hydrochloride, and subjecting them to different pH values or temperatures. Protein unfolding by guanidine hydrochloride resulted in a red shift of the fluorescence spectrum, providing further support for the motion that several of the tryptophan residues evolved from an apolar to a polar environment. Protein denaturation was accompanied by an increase in the effective dynamic quenching constant values and by loss of the enzyme's activities. Thermal denaturation gave results consistent with the ones observed for chemical denaturation suggesting that a putative intermediate is involved in the denaturation process. Finally, exposure of both enzymes at various pH values allowed us to infer the number of accessible tryptophan residues in the different oligomeric conformations. The results suggest that the aggregation process seems to be different for each enzyme. Thus, as the maize enzyme associated from monomer to tetramer, one tryptophan residue would change from a polar to an apolar environment, while the association of the wheat enzyme would cause that two tryptophan residues to be excluded from quenching. Hitherto, quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence provides a good tool for studying conformational changes of proteins.

Based on its >60% similarity to TLPs (thaumatin-like proteins) and the fact that it contains the Prosite PS00316 thaumatin family signature, it is referred to as TLXI (thaumatin-like xylanase inhibitor). TLXI is a basic (pI> or =9.3 in isoelectric focusing) protein with a molecular mass of approx. 18-kDa (determined by SDS/PAGE) and it occurs in wheat with varying extents of glycosylation. The TLXI gene sequence encodes a 26-amino-acid signal sequence followed by a 151-amino-acid mature protein with a calculated molecular mass of 15.6-kDa and pI of 8.38. The mature TLXI protein was expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris, resulting in a 21-kDa (determined by SDS/PAGE) recombinant protein (rTLXI). Polyclonal antibodies raised against TLXI purified from wheat react with epitopes of rTLXI as well as with those of thaumatin, demonstrating high structural similarity between these three proteins. TLXI has a unique inhibition specificity. It is a non-competitive inhibitor of a number of glycoside hydrolase family 11 xylanases, but it is inactive towards glycoside hydrolase family 10 xylanases. Progress curves show that TLXI is a slow tight-binding inhibitor, with a K(i) of approx. 60-nM.

However, the distribution of fungal genera indicated a significantly higher prevalence of Fusarium in conventional (34.93%) than in organic (18.15%) maize, making Fusarium the predominant fungus in conventional maize.

Methanolic extracts of the samples were diluted threefold with buffer containing a mixture of fluorescent antibodies and were then passed over the arrays of mycotoxins immobilized on a waveguide. Fluorescent signals of the surface-bound antibody-antigen complexes decreased with increasing concentrations of free mycotoxins in the extract. After sample analysis was completed, surfaces were regenerated with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride in 50 mM glycine, pH 2.0. The limits of detection determined by the manual biosensor system were as follows: 1, 180, and 65 ng/g for DON and 1, 60, and 85 ng/g for OTA in cornmeal, wheat, and barley, respectively.

These materials are currently disposed of in landfills and could potentially have a negative impact on the effective function of microbes that are intolerant of acidic conditions. A study was undertaken using three different sources of acid waste bentonites, namely soybean oil bentonite (SB), palm oil bentonite (PB), and rice bran oil bentonite (RB). These materials were co-composted with rice husk, rice husk ash, and chicken litter to eliminate their acid reactivity and hydrophobic nature. The organic carbon (OC) content, pH, exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the acid-activated bentonites increased significantly after the co-composting phase. In addition, the hydrophobic nature of these materials as measured using the water drop penetration time (WDPT) decreased from >10 800 s to 16 to 80 s after composting. Furthermore, these composted materials showed positive impacts on soil physical attributes including specific surface area, bulk density, and available water content for crop growth. Highly significant increases in maize biomass (Zea mays L.) production over two consecutive cropping cycles was observed in treatments receiving co-composted bentonite. The study clearly demonstrates the potential for converting an environmentally hazardous material into a high-quality soil conditioner using readily available agricultural byproducts. It is envisaged that the application of these composted acid waste bentonites to degraded soils will increase productivity and on-farm income, thus contributing toward food security and poverty alleviation.",Journal of environmental quality,"['D001546', 'D018533', 'D002244', 'D002852', 'D018556', 'D004784', 'D006813', 'D006863', 'D009930', 'D012037', 'D012989', 'D013997']","['Bentonite', 'Biomass', 'Carbon', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Humidity', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Refuse Disposal', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Time Factors']",Co-composting of acid waste bentonites and their effects on soil properties and crop biomass.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17071900,2007

16912987,"This paper describes the first validated method for the determination of 39 mycotoxins in wheat and maize using a single extraction step followed by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) without the need for any clean-up. The 39 analytes included A- and B-trichothecenes (including deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside), zearalenone and related derivatives, fumonisins, enniatins, ergot alkaloids, ochratoxins, aflatoxins and moniliformin. The large number and the chemical diversity of the analytes required the application of the positive as well as the negative ion ESI mode in two consecutive chromatographic runs of 21 min each. The solvent mixture acetonitrile/water/acetic acid 79 + 20 + 1 (v/v/v) has been determined as the best compromise for the extraction of the analytes from wheat and maize. Raw extracts were diluted 1 + 1 and were injected without any clean-up. Ion-suppression effects due to co-eluting matrix components were negligible in the case of wheat, whereas significant signal suppression for 12 analytes was observed in maize, causing purely proportional systematic errors. Method performance characteristics were determined after spiking blank samples on multiple levels in triplicate. Coefficients of variation of the overall process of <5.1% and <3.0% were obtained for wheat and maize, respectively, from linear calibration data. Limits of detection ranged from 0.03 to 220 microg/kg. Apparent recoveries (including both the recoveries of the extraction step and matrix effects) were within the range of 100 +/- 10% for approximately half of the analytes. In extreme cases the apparent recoveries dropped to about 20%, but this could be compensated for to a large extent by the application of matrix-matched standards to correct for matrix-induced signal suppression, as only a few analytes such as nivalenol and the fumonisins exhibited incomplete extraction. For deoxynivalenol and zearalenone, the trueness of the method was confirmed through the analysis of certified reference materials.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D002851', 'D009183', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D021241', 'D053719', 'D014255', 'D014908', 'D003313', 'D015025']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Mycotoxins', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Trichothecenes', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays', 'Zearalenone']",Development and validation of a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method for the determination of 39 mycotoxins in wheat and maize.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000295', 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'instrumentation', 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16912987,2007

Analysis of iron, zinc, and calcium were performed by atomic absorption spectrometry, and phytate (based on hexa-(IP6) and penta-inositol phosphate (IP5) by HPLC; corresponding [Phy]/[Fe] and [Phy]/[Zn] molar ratios were calculated as predictors of iron and zinc bioavailability. Addition of chicken liver, followed by egg yolk, resulted in the greatest increases in iron and zinc content for both the rice- and maize-based complementary foods, whereas addition of small dried fish with bones had the greatest effect on calcium. The IP5 + IP6 content and [Phy]/[Zn] molar ratios were higher in the maize- than rice-based complementary foods, and were reduced by soaking, although only the maize plus mung bean grits, with and without soaking, had [Phy]/[Zn] molar ratios above 15.

16860333,"The lock-and-key (LAK) motif, a common structural moiety found in subunit interfaces of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), plays an important role in biomolecular recognition and quaternary structure integrity. Inspection of the key structural features of the LAK motif prompted the de novo design and combinatorial synthesis of a 13-membered solid-phase ligand library, employing as a lead ligand the Phe-Trz-X structure, mimicking the LAK motif. 1,3,5-Triazine (Trz) was used as the scaffold for assembly, substituted with different LAK-mimetic amino acids. De novo ligand design was effected using bioinformatics and molecular modeling and based on mimicking the interactions of the LAK motif. The library of affinity adsorbents was assessed for binding corn and human serum proteomes and purified proteins of different structure and ligand binding specificity. The results showed remarkable differences in the binding specificity of LAK-mimetic adsorbents for a wide range of proteins, as a consequence of minor changes in ligand structure. One LAK-mimetic adsorbent was integrated in a single-step purification protocol for human monoclonal anti-human immunodeficiency virus 2F5 antibody (mAb 2F5) from spiked corn extract, affording high recovery and purity.

From their periodic method checks, using standard spiked samples, an 80 sample series with each of the 3 derivatization methods was statistically analyzed. Paired comparisons, using the same sample extract, were also made between the PHRED and one of the other 2 methods, among laboratories in 4 different countries, on a variety of naturally contaminated commodity products. The differences between the techniques were not significant for peanuts, but for corn the photochemical system consistently gave slightly higher values for aflatoxins B1 and B2 than the Kobra cell method. However, a comparison of all sample results showed no significant differences between methods. The Pearson correlation coefficients for aflatoxin B1 in 102 test samples and aflatoxin B2 in 94 test samples were 0.9994 and 0.9874, respectively. The probability factor was P < 0.0001, and the t-tests were not significantly different except for the corn.

Inhibitory activity (mean Sa = 14-24 pmol/well; mean Sa/So = 0.17-0.28) of the masa and tortilla chip extracts were reduced > or = 80% compared to the corn extract. Results were corroborated in a second experiment in which Sa and Sa/So of the wells treated with masa or tortilla chip extracts were reduced > or = 89% compared to those treated with the corn extract. Masa and tortilla chip FB1 concentrations (4-7 ppm) were reduced about 80-90% compared to the corn (30 ppm) when the materials were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

16541407,"The recently introduced technique of an atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) source coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QqTOFMS) has been applied to fast olive oil fingerprinting on the basis of the accurate mass measurements obtained with this instrumentation. The key compounds can be characterized as [M+H]+ (produced by proton transfer) or as [M]+* (by charge transfer) ions in the mass spectra. [M+H]+ ions, however, show higher abundance, especially for triacylglycerols. Other ions present in APPI-MS are the acylium ion [RiCO]+ and [RiCO-H2O]+. This latter ion is absent in the electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS spectra, and this represents valuable complementary information. Several critical parameters in the APPI source were optimized such as LC eluent composition, ion spray voltage and, especially, declustering potential. APPI-QqTOFMS allows easy discrimination among different edible oils: olive, extra virgin olive, olive-pomace, hazelnut, sunflower, corn and several mixed oils, with high throughput (approximately 1 min per sample). Cluster analysis was applied to obtain the best experimental conditions for oil discrimination on the basis of declustering potential.

The method was based on appraisal of the GC-MS and LC-MS-MS characteristics of 660 pesticides, their efficiency of extraction from grain, and their purification. Samples of grain (10 g) were mixed with Celite 545 (10 g) and the mixture was placed in a 34-mL cell of an accelerated solvent extractor and extracted with acetonitrile in the static state for 3 min with two cycles at 1,500 psig and at 80 degrees C. For the 362 pesticides determined by GC-MS, half of the extracts were cleaned with an Envi-18 cartridge and then further cleaned with Envi-Carb and Sep-Pak NH2 cartridges in series. The pesticides were eluted with acetonitrile-toluene, 3:1, and the eluates were concentrated and used for analysis after being exchanged with hexane twice. For the 43 pesticides determined by LC-MS-MS the other half of the extracts were cleaned with Sep-Pak Alumina N cartridge and further cleaned with Envi-Carb and Sep-Pak NH2 cartridges. Pesticides were eluted with acetonitrile-toluene, 3:1. After evaporation to dryness the eluates were diluted with acetonitrile-water, 3:2, and used for analysis.

It should be pointed out that occurance of moulds on food or feed may cause health disorders in humans and animals. Mycoflora appears as a source of toxic methabolites, mycotoxins, which hepatotoxic, genotoxic, nefrotoxic and carcinogenic abilities were already proven in several studies. Hense mycological analysis of cereal grains raises as an important manner in evaluation of food and feed health features. Among the most frequent cereal contaminants Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium strains are mentioned. Due to their ability to grow on cereals during both its field growth and storage, Fusarium moulds occure to be an important contamination factors in food and feed industry. In this study Fusarium strains isolates from wheat and maize were examined in order to recognize their abilities to produce two toxins: zearalenon (ZEA) and deoxynivalenole (DON). Mycological analysis shown differentiation within fungal microflora occuring in samples of different storage conditions, where Fusarium strains represented aproximately 20-70% of all mould species present. In purpose of Fusarium strains species evaluation, isolates were mycologically analysed. In the second step of the project, toxicological screening of isolates was performed using Thin Liquid Chromatography (TLC) evaluating toxigenic potential of single strains' production of ZEA and DON.

Pigments were extracted from four native maize varieties (Arrocillo, Peruano, Purepecha and Cónico), which possess a high anthocyanin concentration in the pericarp. Pericarp and aleurone layer were mechanicallly removed from grain using a Strong-Scott barley pearled. Yields of pericarp and aleurone layer fraction (PALF) were evaluated. Total anthocyanin content in this fraction was determined by a conventional spectrophotometric method and the anthocyanin profile was obtained by HPLC. One mg of anthocyanin extracts from the PALF was added to 100 g of a commercial plain yogurt. Yogurt samples were kept under refrigerated conditions and color and pH were monitored every 5 days interval, during three weeks. The yields of PALF were 48.4%, 55.1%, 40.2%, and 40.0% for Arrocillo, Peruano, Cónico and Purepecha varieties, respectivelly. The highest total anthocyanin content (259.4 mg of anthocyanins/100 g sample) was observed in Peruano PALF. The color of yogurts dyed with each of the four extracts was different.

16428640,"Based on the potential benefits of cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) for human health, there is a need to develop effective strategies for enhancing milk fat CLA concentrations. Levels of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk can be increased by supplements of fish oil (FO) and sunflower oil (SO), but there is considerable variation in the response. Part of this variance may reflect time-dependent ruminal adaptations to high levels of lipid in the diet, which lead to alterations in the formation of specific biohydrogenation intermediates. To test this hypothesis, 16 late lactation Holstein-British Friesian cows were used in a repeated measures randomized block design to examine milk fatty acid composition responses to FO and SO in the diet over a 28-d period. Cows were allocated at random to corn silage-based rations (8 per treatment) containing 0 (control) or 45 g of oil supplement/kg of dry matter consisting (1:2; wt/wt) of FO and SO (FSO), and milk composition was determined on alternate days from d 1. Compared with the control, the FSO diet decreased mean dry matter intake (21.1 vs. 17.9 kg/d), milk fat (47.7 vs. 32.6 g/kg), and protein content (36.1 vs. 33.3 g/kg), but had no effect on milk yield (27.1 vs. 26.4 kg/d). Reductions in milk fat content relative to the FSO diet were associated with increases in milk trans-10 18:1, trans-10, cis-12 CLA, and trans-9, cis-11 CLA concentrations (r(2) = 0.74, 0.57, and 0.80, respectively). Compared with the control, the FSO diet reduced milk 4:0 to 18:0 and cis 18:1 content and increased trans 18:1, trans 18:2, cis-9, trans-11 CLA, 20:5 n-3, and 22:6 n-3 concentrations. The FSO diet caused a rapid elevation in milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, reaching a maximum of 5.37 g/100 g of fatty acids on d 5, but these increases were transient, declining to 2.35 g/100 g of fatty acids by d 15. They remained relatively constant thereafter. Even though concentrations of trans-11 18:1 followed the same pattern of temporal changes as cis-9, trans-11 CLA, the total trans 18:1 content of FSO milk was unchanged because of the concomitant increases in the concentration of other isomers (Delta(4-10) and Delta(12-15)), predominantely trans-10 18:1. In conclusion, supplementing diets with FSO enhances milk fat cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, but the high level of enrichment declines because of changes in ruminal biohydrogenation that result in trans-10 replacing trans-11 as the major 18:1 biohydrogenation intermediate formed in the rumen.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000824', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D004032', 'D005223', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D005395', 'D008401', 'D006865', 'D044243', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D010938', 'D012417', 'D012820', 'D000074242', 'D003313']","['Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Diet', 'Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Fish Oils', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrogenation', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Plant Oils', 'Rumen', 'Silage', 'Sunflower Oil', 'Zea mays']",Examination of the persistency of milk fatty acid composition responses to fish oil and sunflower oil in the diet of dairy cows.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000008', 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428640,2006

The blast results for ROMT-9 showed a 73% identity with caffeic acid OMTs from maize and Triticum aestivum. ROMT-9 was expressed in Escherichia coli and its recombinant protein was purified using affinity chromatography. It was then tested for its ability to transfer the methyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine to the flavonoid substrates, eriodictyol, luteolin, quercetin, and taxifolin, all of which have a 3'-hydroxyl functional group.

Stable isotope labeled standards are best suited to correct for matrix effects and to improve both the trueness and the precision of analytical methods employing LC-MS and LC-MS/MS. This paper describes the successful use of fully 13C isotope labeled deoxynivalenol [(13C15)DON] as an internal standard (IS) for the accurate determination of DON in maize and wheat by LC electrospray ionization MS/MS. To show the full potential of (13C15)DON as IS, maize and wheat extracts were analyzed without further cleanup. Subsequent to calibration for the LC-MS end determination, DON was quantified in matrix reference materials (wheat and maize). Without consideration of the IS, apparent recoveries of DON were 29+/-6% (n=7) for wheat and 37+/-5% (n=7) for maize.

The natural occurrence of fumonisins has been verified in maize and a large range of maize-based products in many countries of the world. However, occasional reports have emerged of fumonisins being detected in wheat, despite the main producing fungi not being pathogens of this cereal. An investigation was conducted into a recent report of the natural occurrence of fumonisins in the 2003/2004 South African wheat crop at levels up to 1.7 mg/kg, as determined by immunoaffinity column cleanup and direct fluorometric measurement. An AOAC International high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of fumonisins in maize was modified and validated for the determination of fumonisins in spiked wheat samples. HPLC analysis of the wheat samples previously found to be positive for fumonisins revealed no detectable (<5 microg/kg) fumonisins in the 30 samples analyzed. These results, which lay doubt on previous reports of fumonisins in wheat, emphasize the fact that screening methods, especially if used outside their range or matrix of applicability, can produce false positive results despite the use of immunoaffinity cleanup.

16245725,"A strategy for rapid in situ elimination of interfering substances that are present in extracts of food samples during assay is described in this article. The novel feature of this method is that the sample purification is carried out as a part of the assay, and a separate sample cleanup step is not required. The assay procedure involves the sequential addition of standard or sample, cleaning solutions, and aflatoxin B1-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (AFB1-HRP) over antibody-spotted zones of a membrane, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate for visualization. We have determined that trifluoroacetic acid and propionic acids at concentrations of 100 mM are highly effective for cleaning groundnut, wheat, corn, and poultry feed samples and that NaHCO3 (100 mM) is successful in cleaning processed soybean. In all cases, subsequent washing was performed with phosphate-buffered saline solution to facilitate the removal of traces of adhering interfering substances. A batch of 12 samples can be analyzed within 8 min either by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards or, more precisely, by densitometry. The method was tested for the analysis of AFB1 in groundnut, wheat, corn, processed soybean, chili, and poultry feed. The detection limit obtained was 5 microg/kg, except for chili, where it was 10 microg/kg. The average recoveries from different noninfected food samples spiked with AFB1 at concentrations of 5 to 100 microg/kg were between 99 and 105%. The values obtained for infected corn and groundnut samples correlated well with the estimates obtained by high-pressure liquid chromatography.

Further, concentrations in rice were compared to total soil concentrations in paddy fields. Compared to the reference area, food items produced in the contaminated area had increased levels of Cd, Co, Ni and Mn in particular, while levels of Mo were lower. In contrast, total soil concentrations of Cd and Mn in particular have decreased whereas especially Mo was increased. In combination with the observed soil acidification, it is likely that the bioavailable concentration of most elements in the contaminated soil is higher (except for Mo) due to an increased weathering rate and/or input via the contaminated irrigation water.

16027206,"Heavy metals such as zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) are potential bioaccumulative toxins of the dairy production system. The heavy metal content of dairy feeds, however, remains poorly documented, particularly in the United States. This survey determined the heavy metal content of 203 typical dairy ration components sampled from 54 dairy farms in Wisconsin. Lowest heavy metal concentrations were found in homegrown alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay and haylage, and corn (Zea mays L.) grain and silage. Highest metal concentrations were found in purchased feeds, particularly mineral supplements, and to a lesser extent corn- or soybean-based concentrates. Zinc and Cu were found at the highest concentration in complete dairy (total mixed and aggregated component) rations and reflected the deliberate addition of these metals to meet animal nutrient requirements although more than half the farms fed Cu and Zn above US recommended levels. Concentrations of Cr, As, Cd, and Pb were present in much lower concentrations and decreased in the order Cr > As > Pb > Cd. No complete Wisconsin dairy ration contained heavy metal concentrations above US maximum acceptable concentrations and would be unlikely to induce any toxic effects in dairy cattle. Concentrations of Cd in complete dairy rations were closest to US maximum acceptable concentrations, suggesting the greatest potential long-term risk to exceed US maximum acceptable concentrations if whole farm levels of Cd were to increase in the future. With the exception of Pb, the main sources of Zn, Cu, Cr, As, and Cd in the complete dairy feed ration originated from imported feed. The continued importation of heavy metals in dairy feed is likely to be associated with accumulation of these metals in soils where manure is applied. Although the cycling of many heavy metals through the dairy food chain will be limited by factors such as a soil's cation exchange capacity, pH, salinity, and phytotoxicity of the metal, these may be less limiting for Cd. It is important that sources of Cd in the dairy system are identified and minimized to prevent problems associated with Cd accumulation in the dairy soil system arising over the long-term.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000821', 'D000818', 'D001151', 'D002104', 'D002417', 'D002857', 'D003300', 'D003612', 'D004032', 'D005260', 'D007774', 'D007854', 'D013058', 'D000455', 'D019216', 'D012820', 'D013053', 'D014922', 'D003313', 'D015032']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Cadmium', 'Cattle', 'Chromium', 'Copper', 'Dairying', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Lactation', 'Lead', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Medicago sativa', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Silage', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Wisconsin', 'Zea mays', 'Zinc']",A survey of selected heavy metal concentrations in Wisconsin dairy feeds.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16027206,2006

16019804,"This article covers the latest activities in mycotoxin analysis and the advances of its respective quality assurance. The majority of mycotoxin analyses carried out in the laboratories is still based on physicochemical methods, which are continually improved. For example, immunoaffinity columns and multifunctional clean-up columns have become of increasing importance and in some areas of mycotoxin analysis they have more or less displaced conventional liquid-liquid partitioning or column chromatography during clean-up. The need for rapid yes/no decisions on the other hand has led to a number of new screening methods. In particular, rapid and easy-to-use test kits based on immunoanalytical principles or the generation of artificial macromolecular receptors employed in molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have made good progress. Further research in mycotoxin analysis is pursued in the field of biosensors and also the potential of infrared spectroscopic techniques as screening method has been demonstrated. In the area of multi mycotoxin analysis the most promising development was observed in mass spectrometry. At the same time, several interlaboratory studies in the field of mycotoxin analysis revealed problems proven by high between laboratory standard deviation and non-traceable results. This not only shows the necessity of reliable methods and well defined performance characteristics but also the need for appropriate calibrants of defined concentration and stated purity. A certified zearalenone (ZON) calibrant is already available and a certified calibrant containing various trichothecenes is currently under development. (Certified) reference materials are available for aflatoxins in a number of commodities, ochratoxin A (OTA) in wheat, deoxynivalenol (DON) in maize and wheat, and ZON in maize.

LC and MS conditions were varied to find the best compromise in terms of sensitivity and separation. An acceptable compromise was obtained using a C18 column thermostatted at 45 degrees C and a mobile phase gradient of methanol/water with 10 mmol/L formate buffer (pH 3.8). A multiple reaction monitoring program, in which fumonisins and trichothecenes (except nivalenol and deoxynivalenol) are acquired in positive ESI as [M+H]+ or [M+NH4]+, and all other compounds in negative ESI, was developed to match appropriate retention time windows. Sample preparation used a simple homogenization of the corn meal sample with acetonitrile/water (75:25, v/v) followed by extraction on a C18 cartridge and clean-up on a cartridge containing graphitized carbon black.

Proteomics is exerting its influence on biological function of genes and genomes in the era (21st century) of functional genomics, and for this reason yeast, bacterial, and mammalian systems are the best examples. Although plant proteomics is still in its infancy, evolving proteomic technologies and the availability of the genome sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

Rice, with an immense socio-economic impact on human civilization, is a representative model of cereal food crops, and we consider it as a cornerstone for functional genomics of cereal plants. In this review, we look at the history and the current state of monocot proteomes, including barley, maize, and wheat, with a central focus on rice, which has the most extensive proteomic coverage to date. On one side, we highlight advances in technologies that have generated enormous amount of interest in plant proteomics, and the other side summarizes the achievements made towards establishing proteomes during plant growth & development and challenge to environmental factors, including disease, and for studying genetic relationships.

15954725,"Using uncertainty associated with detection of aflatoxin in shelled corn as a model, the uncertainty associated with detecting chemical agents intentionally added to food products was evaluated. Accuracy and precision are two types of uncertainties generally associated with sampling plans. Sources of variability that affect precision were the primary focus of this investigation. Test procedures used to detect chemical agents generally include sampling, sample preparation, and analytical steps. The uncertainty of each step contributes to the total uncertainty of the test procedure. Using variance as a statistical measure of uncertainty, the variance associated with each step of the test procedure used to detect aflatoxin in shelled corn was determined for both low and high levels of contamination. For example, when using a 1-kg sample, Romer mill, 50-g subsample, and high-performance liquid chromatography to test a lot of shelled corn contaminated with aflatoxin at 10 ng/g, the total variance associated with the test procedure was 149.2 (coefficient of variation of 122.1%). The sampling, sample preparation, and analytical steps accounted for 83.0, 15.6, and 1.4% of the total variance, respectively. A variance of 149.2 suggests that repeated test results will vary from 0 to 33.9 ng/g. Using the same test procedure to detect aflatoxin at 10,000 ng/g, the total variance was 264,719 (coefficient of variation of 5.1%). The sampling, sample preparation, and analytical steps accounted for 41, 57, and 2% of the total variance, respectively. A variance of 264,719 suggests that repeated test results will vary from 8,992 to 11,008 ng/g. Foods contaminated at low levels reflect a situation in which a small percentage of particles is contaminated and sampling becomes the largest source of uncertainty. Large samples are required to overcome the ""needle-in-the-haystack"" problem. Aflatoxin is easier to detect and identify in foods intentionally contaminated at high levels than in foods with low levels of contamination because the relative standard deviation (coefficient of variation) decreases and the percentage of contaminated kernels increases with an increase in concentration.",Journal of food protection,"['D000348', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D023482', 'D002851', 'D004305', 'D005504', 'D006801', 'D008962', 'D015203', 'D012680', 'D003313']","['Aflatoxins', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Bioterrorism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Food Analysis', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Zea mays']",Sampling uncertainties for the detection of chemical agents in complex food matrices.,"['Q000302', None, None, 'Q000517', 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['isolation & purification', None, None, 'prevention & control', 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15954725,2005

15913016,"A major, often unrecognized variable regulating plant growth in semi-closed environment is air contaminant. The vapor of propylene glycol (PG), which was used as coolant in growth chambers, has been found to be toxic to corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) plants. PG solution leaked from a valve packing system and volatilized to vapor, which was trapped in a semi-closed growth chamber. Symptoms of leaf edge chlorosis, later developing into necrosis, were observed on the third day of emergence or on the third day after moving healthy plants into the chamber. For young soybean plants, symptoms were slightly different from those observed in corn plants; the chlorosis symptoms were not uniformly distributed on all leaves. Some soybean leaves curled up and others had white spots. This problem was identified by using a portable photoionization detector to obtain instantaneous readings of total volatile organic compound concentrations inside the chambers.

To obtain appropriate standards, we chemically synthesized deoxynivalenol-3-beta-D-glucopyranoside (DON-3-glucoside) and deoxynivalenol-15-beta-D-glucopyranoside (DON-15-glucoside). The synthesis products were characterized by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The DON-glucosides showed different collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation behaviors and could therefore be distinguished. Wheat plants were either treated with DON (n = 52) or with Fusarium spp. (n = 4) at anthesis, and after harvest, wheat ears were analyzed for DON and DON-glucosides. All 56 treated wheat samples contained DON and a DON-glucoside with the same retention time, molecular mass, and CID fragmentation behavior as the synthetic DON-3-glucoside. Moreover, the DON-glucoside was also found in two out of three analyzed naturally DON-contaminated maize and in five out of five naturally contaminated wheat samples, in a range from 4 to 12% of the DON concentration. To further confirm the identity of the DON-glucoside, the compound was isolated from wheat extracts and characterized as DON-3-glucoside with NMR.

15825684,"This paper reports the results of studies performed to investigate the potential of applying thin layer chromatography (TLC) detection in combination with selected extraction and cleanup methods, for providing an alternative cost-effective analytical procedure for screening and confirmation of pesticide residues in plant commodities. The extraction was carried out with ethyl acetate and an on-line extraction method applying an acetone-dichloromethane mixture. The extracts were cleaned up with SX-3 gel, an adsorbent mixture of active carbon, magnesia, and diatomaceous earth, and on silica micro cartridges. The Rf values of 118 pesticides were tested in eleven elution systems with UV, and eight biotest methods and chemical detection reagents. Cabbage, green peas, orange, and tomatoes were selected as representative sample matrices for fruits and vegetables, while maize, rice, and wheat represented cereal grains. As an internal quality control measure, marker compounds were applied on each plate to verify the proper elution and detection conditions. The Rf values varied in the different elution systems. The best separation (widest Rf range) was achieved with silica gel (SG)--ethyl acetate (0.05-0.7), SG--benzene, (0.02-0.7) and reverse phase RP-18 F-254S layer with acetone: methanol: water/30:30:30 (v/v) (0.1-0.8). The relative standard deviation of Rf values (CV(Rf)) within laboratory reproducibility was generally less than 20%, except below 0.2 Rf, where the CVRf rapidly increased with decreasing Rf values. The fungi spore inhibition, chloroplast inhibition, and enzyme inhibition were found most suitable for detection of pesticides primarily for confirming their identity or screening for known substances. Their use for determination of pesticide residues in samples of unknown origin is not recommended.","Journal of environmental science and health. Part.

15799562,"Thirty retail samples of heat-processed corn foods, i.e. corn flakes, corn-based breakfast cereals, tortilla chips and corn chips, were analysed for fumonisins--fumonisin B1 (FB1), fumonisin B2 (FB2) and hydrolysed FB1 (HFB1)--as well as for protein- and total-bound FB1. Bound (hidden) fumonisins cannot be detected by conventional analysis. Improved methods for the determination of bound FB1 were developed. The protein-bound FB1 was extracted with 1% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) solution. The SDS, which interfered with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, was then separated from protein-bound FB1 by complexing with methylene blue followed by solvent extraction and hydrolysis with 2 N KOH. To measure total-bound FB1, the sample itself was hydrolysed with KOH. In both cases, clean-up was accomplished on an OASIS polymeric solid-phase extraction column and the bound fumonisins were determined by HPLC measurement of HFB1. Fourteen of 15 samples of corn flakes and other corn-based breakfast cereals analysed contained detectable levels of FB1 with a mean in positive samples of 67ng g(-1) (13-237 ng g(-1)). Two samples also had detectable levels of FB2 (21-23ng g(-1)). Bound FB1 was found in all samples; the mean protein-bound FB1 measured was 58 ng g(-1) (22-176 ng g(-1)) and the mean total-bound FB1 measured was 106 ng g(-1) (28-418 ng g(-1)), reported as FB1 equivalents after correction for recoveries of HFB1. There was an average of about 1.3 times more FB1 in the bound form compared with extractable FB1, and this was about twice as much as protein-bound FB1. Seven of the 15 samples of alkali-processed corn-based foods, such as tortilla chips and corn chips, contained FB1 and three contained HFB1 with means in measurable positive samples of 78 (48-134) and 29 (13-47) ng g(-1), respectively. Five of these alkali-processed corn foods contained bound FB1; the mean measurable protein-bound FB1 was 42 ng g(-1) (39-46 ng g(-1)) and the mean measurable total-bound FB1 was 100 ng g(-1) (54-209 ng g(-1)).

15795896,"Stable isotope composition of human tissue reflects that of foods consumed, and can provide information about diet independent of artifactual remains. Here we refine and test this method by analyzing nitrogen (delta(15)N) and carbon (delta(13)C) isotope ratios in historic North American Plains Indians hair. Gas-source isotope-ratio mass spectrometry provides high-precision data for both delta(15)N and delta(13)C (+/-0.2 per thousand, 1 sigma) in single hair strands as short as 2 cm (100-150 mug). Because hair contains more carbon than nitrogen, if only delta(13)C data are needed, shorter strands (<1 cm) can be analyzed. This reduction in sample size opens new opportunities for analysis of small hair fragments found in archaeological excavations, as well as for analysis of seasonal variations in long hair strands. We find distinct isotope profiles (delta(15)N vs. delta(13)C) for two cultural groups, the Lower Brule reservation Sioux of 1892 and the reservation Blackfoot of 1892 and 1935. The resultant dietary profiles indicate a higher consumption of meat by the Blackfoot and a higher consumption of maize (or of animals that had fed on maize or other C(4) plants) by the Lower Brule. The two groups of Blackfoot yield similar isotopic profiles despite the passage of four decades, suggesting a strong role for cultural preference even as food sources change.

This work reports a fast, sensitive, and selective procedure for the extraction and determination of carotenoids from cereals and cereal byproducts. The method involves sample saponification and extraction followed by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, allowing the separation of the main carotenoids pigments of cereals, especially lutein and zeaxanthin. An application of the established method to various species of cereals and cereal byproducts is also shown. The highest carotenoid levels were found in maize (approximately 11.14 mg/kg of dry weight), which contains high amounts of beta-cryptoxanthin (2.40 mg/kg of dry weight), and, among the cereals considered, has the highest content of zeaxanthin (6.43 mg/kg of dry weight) and alpha+beta-carotene (1.44 mg/kg of dry weight).

The procedure involves accelerated solvent extraction followed by two solid-phase clean-up steps on strong anion exchange resin and a Mycosep column. Typical recoveries were calculated by spiking blank maize at three different concentrations for deoxynivalenol (200, 400 and 1000 microg kg(-1)) at 70%, for fumonisin B1 (100, 200 and 1000 microg kg(-1)) at 90%, and for zearalenone (50, 100 and 200 microg kg(-1)) at 40%. LC-APCIMS/MS analyses were realized in collision-induced dissociation on an ion-trap instrument to provide a high degree of selectivity and sensitivity. Extraction of ions from two transition reactions, monitored by LC-APCIMS/MS for each analyte, enabled a limit of detection for DON, FB1 and ZEN at, respectively, 10, 20 and 3 microg kg(-1), and a limit of quantification at, respectively, 50, 50 and 10 microg kg(-1).

Isotopic analysis of the lipid-free and lipid fraction of the fish after the experiment revealed that the trophic shift was not constant for wheat- and corn-based diets.

The levels of two Fusarium toxins, nivalenol and deoxynivalenol (DON) were quantitated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a total of 97 samples of dietary wheat flour, barley and corn collected from families in two areas with high mortality rate of cancer of esophagus and gastric cardia (132/100,000), Linxian, Henan province and Cixiang, Hepei province, China. The mean level of NIV and DON in three dietary foods was 830+/-927 microg/kg (range 584-1,780 microg/kg) and 4,281+/-6,114 microg/kg (range 732-10,980 microg/kg) respectively. The highest mean level of NIV was 1,780+/-1,705 microg/kg found in barley from Linxian, that of DON was 10,980+/-10,139 microg/kg found in corn from Cixiang. NIV was undetectable in 2 samples of rice from USA. The mean levels of NIV in three main dietary foods in those two high-risk areas were estimated at 400 to 800-fold higher than that in the USA, where NIV was undetectable in dietary food, and the mortality rate of esophageal cancer is <5/100,000 in white Caucasians in the USA, (odds ratio was estimated at 17-34, p<0.000005). These data suggest that Linxian and Cixiang peasants who consumed a diet with high NIV had significantly higher risk for developing esophageal cancer than the US residents who consumed food without or with negligible amounts of NIV.

A number of instrument- and antibody-based methods including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been developed to detect zearalenone (ZEN) and related toxins in commodities and foods. Although convenient, the commercial ELISAs for small molecules such as ZEN require a washing step to separate bound and unbound enzyme label before detection. In fluorescence polarization immunoassays, separation of bound and unbound label is not required, a property that reduces the time needed to perform the assays. We developed a fluorescence polarization immunoassay for ZEN in maize. When combined with a rapid extraction technique, the assay could be used to detect as little as 0.11 microg of ZEN g(-1) maize within 10 min.

The transgenic rice plants require foliar application of amines to support synthesis of hydroxycinnamic acid amides, suggestive of limiting amine substrates in rice shoots. In addition, when T2 homozygous transgenic rice plants were grown in the presence of amines or phenolic acids, two novel compounds were exclusively identified in the leaves of the transgenic plants.

15036012,"Although both non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and resistant starches (RS) are included in current definitions of dietary fibre, our previous work has suggested fundamental differences in the way in which these two classes of material affect the disposition and absorption of a dietary carcinogen. The present studies explore whether different effects on carcinogen metabolism could play a role in the contrasting patterns seen previously. Groups of female Wistar rats were pre-fed for 4 weeks one of five types of defined diet (AIN-76). The control diet contained 35% maize starch and no dietary fibre. The RS-containing diets had all the maize starch substituted with either Hi-maize or potato starch. In the NSP-containing diets, 10% of the maize starch was substituted with dietary fibre in the form of either lignified plant cell walls (wheat straw) or soluble dietary fibre (apple pectin). Pre-fed rats were gavaged with the food carcinogen, [2-14C] 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), and plasma and urinary metabolites characterized using HPLC at various time intervals after administration. After 4 h gavage, plasma from rats on both RS-containing diets contained significantly higher levels of intact IQ and lower levels of the major metabolites, IQ-5-O-glucuronide and IQ-5-sulfate, as compared with plasma from the negative control group at this time. In contrast, plasma from animals on the NSP-containing wheat straw diet (and to a lesser extent the apple pectin diet) showed significantly lower levels of intact IQ, and significantly higher levels of the two major metabolites, as compared with those from the control rats. These different metabolite profiles were also reflected in different urinary excretion profiles. Urine from rats pre-fed RS-containing diets revealed significantly slower metabolite excretion as compared with urine from rats that had been given the NSP-containing diets. Western blotting methodologies also profiled differences between the effects of these two types of dietary fibre in the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. We conclude that changes in activity and expression of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes could play a role in the contrasting effects of these two types of dietary fibre on carcinogen uptake and disposition.","Journal of chromatography.

Using different LC conditions, deoxynivalenol (DON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), and zearalenone (ZEN) were detected in four different matrices (fungal liquid cultures, maize grain, insect larvae and pig serum). The sensitivity of MS detection allowed us to detect concentrations as low as 8 ppb of DON and 12 ppb of ZEN. A very small quantity of matrix was therefore necessary for successful analysis of these toxins and a variety of experimental situations were successfully investigated using this technique. Production of 15-ADON and butenolide was monitored in a liquid culture of F. graminearum under controlled conditions. Using simple extraction procedures, the differential accumulation of DON and 15-ADON was followed in inoculated maize genotypes varying in susceptibility to F. graminearum.

Finally, persistence of DON was assessed in pigs fed diet supplemented with DON, results indicated that DON accumulates quickly in pig blood and then levels decline progressively for 12 hours thereafter.

14994812,"Cucurbitacins are feeding stimulants for corn rootworm used in baits to control the adults of this insect pest. Corn rootworm larvae also feed compulsively on cucurbitacins. Cucurbitacins are reported to be gibberellin antagonists that may preclude their use as seed treatments for these soil-dwelling insects. The crude extract of a bitter Hawkesbury watermelon containing cucurbitacin E-glycoside significantly inhibited germination of watermelon, squash, and tomato seeds. Although the germination of corn seed was not significantly inhibited, root elongation was inhibited by crude extracts, but not by high-performance liquid chromatography-purified cucurbitacin E-glycoside. Therefore, the effects of the major components in the bitter watermelon extract (e.g., sugars) on seed germination and root elongation were determined. Pure sugars (glucose and fructose), at concentrations found in watermelon extract, mimicked the inhibition of seed germination and root elongation seen with the crude bitter Hawkesbury watermelon extract. Removal of these sugars may be necessary to use this extract as a bait for corn rootworm larvae as a seed or root treatment.",Journal of economic entomology,"['D000818', 'D029773', 'D001517', 'D028464', 'D054728', 'D018525', 'D018551', 'D010675', 'D010936', 'D018517', 'D012639', 'D014315', 'D003313']","['Animals', 'Citrullus', 'Coleoptera', 'Cucurbita', 'Cucurbitacins', 'Germination', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Pheromones', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Roots', 'Seeds', 'Triterpenes', 'Zea mays']","Inhibition of seed germination by extracts of bitter Hawkesbury watermelon containing cucurbitacin, a feeding stimulant for corn rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae).","[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000254', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000254', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000254', 'Q000254', 'Q000494', 'Q000254']","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'growth & development', None, 'drug effects', 'growth & development', None, 'pharmacology', 'growth & development', 'growth & development', 'pharmacology', 'growth & development']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14994812,2004

The time required and the quantities of solvents employed in the developed analytical method are much lower than those involved in previously available assays of these compounds, thus making the method suitable for the screening of cereal genotypes. Application of the method to accessions of maize, wheat and sorghum showed that E-ferulic was the most abundant phenylpropanoid, whilst the major dimer was 8-O-4' dehydrodimer of ferulic acid followed by the 5-5' and then the 8-5' forms.

Diacetyl (NMAM 2557) is efficiently recovered from an Anasorb CMS sampler tube when the composition of methanol in the desorption solvent is 1%, and acetoin (NMAM 2558) is efficiently recovered when the concentration of methanol is increased to 5%. Desorption efficiencies for diacetyl and acetoin were acceptable, 89.9% (RSD = 0.018) and 94.9% (RSD = 0.019), respectively. Recoveries for nonanone, methyl ethyl ketone, and ethyl acetate were not optimized because they were present in very low concentrations in the popcorn processing facility and not considered to be major occupational health hazards. Samples were collected on Anasorb CMS solid sorbent tubes. All analytes were separated using a 30-m Stabilwax-DA fused silica capillary column, followed by analysis using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. These methods were acceptable for monitoring and identifying exposures to diacetyl and acetoin present in the butter flavoring mixture used at popcorn processing facilities. For example, in the initial site visit the method was used to determine that maximum workers exposures to diacetyl (462.6 mg/m3), acetoin (59.1 mg/m3), and nonanone (0.45 mg/m3) occurred as the butter flavoring was added to the mixing kettle. When protective measures were recommended by NIOSH personnel and implemented bythe popcorn processing facility, the methods were then used to determine the effectiveness of these changes, which showed that diacetyl and acetoin concentrations had been reduced significantly to 0.97 and 2.3 mg/m3, respectively, while the concentration of nonanone fell to levels below the detection limit (LOD).",Environmental science & technology,"['D000093', 'D016902', 'D003931', 'D004784', 'D019649', 'D006801', 'D008872', 'D016273', 'D017132', 'D003313']","['Acetoin', 'Air Pollution, Indoor', 'Diacetyl', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Food Industry', 'Humans', 'Microwaves', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Workplace', 'Zea mays']",Method development for the determination of diacetyl and acetoin at a microwave popcorn plant.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14968874,2004

14667708,"Eight commercial starches, including common corn, waxy corn, wheat, tapioca, potato, Hylon V, Hylon VII, and mung bean starch, were annealed by a multiple-step process, and their gelatinization characteristics were determined. Annealed starches had higher gelatinization temperatures, reduced gelatinization ranges, and increased gelatinization enthalpies than their native starches. The annealed starches with the highest gelatinization enthalpies were subjected to acid hydrolysis with 15.3% H2SO4, and Naegeli dextrins were prepared after 10 days' hydrolysis. Annealing increased the acid susceptibility of native starches in the first (rapid) and the second (slow) phases with potato starch showing the greatest and high amylose starches showing the least changes. Starches with a larger shift in onset gelatinization temperature also displayed a greater percent hydrolysis. The increase in susceptibility to acid hydrolysis was proposed to result from defective and porous structures that resulted after annealing. Although annealing perfected the crystalline structure, it also produced void space, which led to porous structures and possible starch granule defects. The molecular size distribution and chain length distribution of Naegeli dextrins of annealed and native starches were analyzed.

The specific activity of 14C-FB1 produced made the study of its fate in cornmeal muffins possible. The double-extraction acetonitrile-water-methanol/immunoaffinity column/o-phthaldialdehyde high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used to determine FB1 levels in cornmeal muffins. Reductions in FB1 levels in muffins spiked with 14C-labeled and unlabeled FB1 (43 and 48%, respectively) were similar, indicating that the extraction method was efficient and consistent with previous reports. However, with the labeled corn kernel material, recovery levels based on the 14C counts for the eluate from an immunoaffinity column were much higher (90%).

The measured spectra were evaluated with principal component analysis (PCA) and the blank and contaminated samples were classified by cluster analysis. Reference data for fungal metabolites were obtained with conventional methods. After extraction and clean-up, each sample was analyzed for the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) and ergosterol (a parameter for the total fungal biomass) by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The concentration ranges for contaminated samples were 880-3600 microg/kg for ergosterol and 300-2600 microg/kg for DON. Classification efficiency was 100% for ATR spectra. DR spectra did not show as obvious a clustering of contaminated and blank samples. Results and trends were also observed in single spectra plots.

12970342,"Plant pathogenic fungi of the genus Fusarium cause agriculturally important diseases of small grain cereals and maize. Trichothecenes are a class of mycotoxins produced by different Fusarium species that inhibit eukaryotic protein biosynthesis and presumably interfere with the expression of genes induced during the defense response of the plants. One of its members, deoxynivalenol, most likely acts as a virulence factor during fungal pathogenesis and frequently accumulates in grain to levels posing a threat to human and animal health. We report the isolation and characterization of a gene from Arabidopsis thaliana encoding a UDP-glycosyltransferase that is able to detoxify deoxynivalenol. The enzyme, previously assigned the identifier UGT73C5, catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl group at carbon 3 of deoxynivalenol. Using a wheat germ extract-coupled transcription/translation system we have shown that this enzymatic reaction inactivates the mycotoxin. This deoxynivalenol-glucosyltransferase (DOGT1) was also found to detoxify the acetylated derivative 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, whereas no protective activity was observed against the structurally similar nivalenol. Expression of the glucosyltransferase is developmentally regulated and induced by deoxynivalenol as well as salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid.

Four discrete spectral forms of Pchlide, with emission peaks around 633, 640, 656 and 670 nm, could be distinguished after Gaussian deconvolution. In maize and wheat the 656 nm component was the most prominent, whereas for wild-type pea and its lip1 mutant, the 633 and 640 nm components contributed mostly to the fluorescence emission spectra. For the fluorescence lifetimes measured at 77 K a double exponential model was the most adequate to describe the Pchlide fluorescence decay not only for the Pchlide(650-656) form but also for the short-wavelength Pchlide forms. A fast component in the range 0.3-0.8 ns and a slow component in the range 5.1-7.1 ns were present in all samples, but the values varied, depending on species. The long-wavelength Pchlide(650-656) form had a slow component with a lifetime between 5.1 and 6.7 ns, probably reflecting the fluorescence from aggregated Pchlide. The short-wavelength Pchlide(628-633) form had values of the slow component varying between 6.2 and 7.1 ns.

Cows were fed total mixed rations containing (dry matter basis) 44% corn silage, 22% alfalfa silage, 2% urea, and 31% concentrate. The basal diet contained 31% high-moisture corn; equal N from one of four protein supplements was added to the other diets at the expense of corn: 9% solvent soybean meal (SSBM), 10% expeller soybean meal (ESBM), 5.5% blood meal (BM), and 7% corn gluten meal (CGM). Omasal sampling was used to quantify total AA N (TAAN) and nonammonia N (NAN) flows from the rumen. Estimates of RUP were made from differences between total and microbial N flows, including a correction for RUP in the basal diet. Modifying a spectrophotometric assay improved total purine recovery from isolated bacteria and omasal samples and gave estimates of microbial TAAN and NAN flows that were similar to a standard HPLC method. Linear programming, based on AA patterns of the diet and isolated omasal bacteria and ruminal protozoa, appeared to overestimate microbial TAAN and NAN flows compared to the purine assays. Yields of microbial TAAN and NAN determined using any method was not affected by diet and averaged 32 to 35 g NAN per kilogram of organic matter truly digested in the rumen.

12739096,"An analytical methodology based on a molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedure was developed for the determination of several triazines (atrazine, simazine, desethylatrazine (DEA), desisopropylatrazine (DIA), and propazine) in vegetable samples. A methacrylic acid-based imprinted polymer was prepared by precipitation polymerisation using propazine as template and toluene as porogen. After removal of the template by Soxhlet extraction, the optimum loading, washing, and elution conditions for MISPE of the selected triazines were established. The optimised MISPE procedure was applied to the extraction of the selected triazines in pea, potato, and corn sample extracts and a high degree of clean-up was obtained. However, some remaining interferences, non-specifically and strongly bound to the polymeric matrix, appeared in the chromatogram, preventing quantification of DIA in potatoes and DIA, DEA, and propazine in corn samples. Thus, a new clean-up protocol based on the use of a non-imprinted polymer for removal of these interferences prior to the MISPE step was developed. By following the new two-step MISPE procedure, the matrix compounds were almost completely removed, allowing the determination of all the triazines selected at concentration levels below the established maximum residue limits, making the developed procedure suitable for monitoring these analytes in vegetable samples.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002851', 'D005504', 'D006540', 'D018532', 'D010573', 'D011108', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D012680', 'D011198', 'D014227', 'D014675', 'D003313']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Herbicides', 'Peas', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Polymers', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Triazines', 'Vegetables', 'Zea mays']",Clean-up of triazines in vegetable extracts by molecularly-imprinted solid-phase extraction using a propazine-imprinted polymer.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000302', 'Q000737', 'Q000302', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'methods', 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', 'isolation & purification', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12739096,2003

A statistical design approach was applied to evaluate the influence of several extraction parameters such as temperature (40 degrees C; 80 degrees C; 120 degrees C), time (5 min; 10 min) and solvent extraction mixture [acetonitrile-water (9:1, v/v); methanol-water (8:2, v/v); methanol-acetonitrile (1:1, v/v)] on fortified cereals. The results showed a strong influence of the solvent composition on recovery of ZON. Quantification of the analytes was performed by LC-MS analysis of the raw extract using matrix-matched standard curves. The method performance was tested in the selected conditions (80 degrees C; 5 min; two cycles; methanol-acetonitrile) on samples which had been previously used for an international proficiency test. Compared to the assigned value, the recovered ZON was 118% [relative standard deviation (RSD)=5.2%, n=3)] and 107% (RSD=2.2%, n=3) in wheat and corn, respectively. Therefore, PLE can be used for ZON extraction, achieving good performances and allowing for an automated handling of the sample extraction step. Successively, the influence of temperature and number of cycles was investigated on naturally contaminated corn.

These metabolites are highly toxic to animals and humans and high levels have been measured in agricultural crops. In order to evaluate human risks due to ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated food different methods have been developed for analysis of mycotoxins in cereals and maize. In this project the focus was on mycotoxins in agricultural soil and the fate of these toxins in the soil-water-plant system. Two different mycotoxins were selected in the study: zearalenone (ZON) produced by species of Fusariumor Aspergillusand ochratoxin A (OTA) produced by species of Penicillium. We developed a method for analysis of these toxins in soil. Soil samples were extracted with methanol-water (9:1) and purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE, C8-columns). The final extract was analysed using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. A Phenyl Hexyl column was used to separate the toxins. The detection limits obtained were 0.1 and 1.0 microg kg(-1) dry weight (dw) for OTA and ZON, respectively. The developed method has been used for analysis of different soils in connection with growth chamber experiments. The soil types used in the growth chamber experiments were a sandy soil, a sandy clay soil, and a soil with high content of organic matter. The recovery was determined as 85.8 and 93.4% and the repeatability to 5.1 and 12.8% for OTA and ZON, respectively.

12696918,"There is a growing interest in producing food plants with increased amounts of flavonoids because of their potential health benefits. Tomatoes contain small amounts of flavonoids, most of which are located in the peel of the fruit. It has been shown that flavonoid accumulation in tomato flesh, and hence an overall increase in flavonoid levels in tomato fruit, can be achieved by means of simultaneous overexpression of the maize transcription factors LC and C1. Fruit from progeny of two modified lines (2027 and 2059) was selected for a detailed analysis and individual identification of flavonoids, at different stages of maturity. Nine major flavonoids were detected in the flesh of transgenic ripe tomatoes. LC/NMR, LC/MS, and LC/MS/MS enabled us to identify these as kaempferol-3,7-di-O-glucoside (1), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside-7-O-glucoside (2), two dihydrokaempferol-O-hexosides (3 and 4), rutin (5), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (6), kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (7), naringenin-7-O-glucoside (8) and naringenin chalcone (9), which were quantified by HPLC/DAD. All but 5, 6, and 9 were detected in tomato for the first time. The total flavonoid glycoside content of ripe transgenic tomatoes of line 2059 was about 10-fold higher than that of the controls, and kaempferol glycosides accounted for 60% of this.

The 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxy derivatives of beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol and the 7-keto-beta-sitosterol were the principal phytosterol oxides found in almost all of the oils analyzed. In some oils, the epoxy and dihydroxy derivatives of beta-sitosterol were also found at very low levels. The highest total concentrations of phytosterol oxides, ranging from 4.5 to 67.5 and from 4.1 to 60.1 ppm, were found in sunflower and maize oils, respectively. Lower concentrations were present in the peanut oils, 2.7-9.6 ppm, and in the palm nut oil, 5.5 ppm, whereas in the lampante olive oils, only three samples of the six analyzed contained a low concentration (1.5-2.5 ppm) of oxyphytosterols. No detectable levels of phytosterol oxides were found in the samples of palm and coconut oils. Bleaching experiments were carried out on a sample of sunflower oil at 80 degrees C for 1 h with 1 and 2% of both acidic and neutral earths. The bleaching caused a reduction of the hydroxyphytosterol with partial formation of steroidal hydrocarbons with three double bonds in the ring system at the 2-, 4-, and 6-positions (steratrienes). The same sunflower oil was deodorized at 180 degrees C under vacuum for 1 h, and no dehydration products were formed with a complete recovery of the hydroxyphytosterols.

12661024,"Maize oil commands a premium price and is thus a target for adulteration with cheaper vegetable oils. Detection of this activity presents a particular challenge to the analyst because of the natural variability in the fatty acid composition of maize oils and because of their high sterol and tocopherol contents. This paper describes a method that allows detection of adulteration at concentrations of just 5% (m/m), based on the Mahalanobis distances of the principal component scores of the delta(13)C values of major and minor vegetable oil components. The method makes use of a database consisting of delta(13)C values and relative abundances of the major fatty acyl components of over 150 vegetable oils. The sterols and tocopherols of 16 maize oils and 6 potential adulterant oils were found to be depleted in (13)C by a constant amount relative to the bulk oil. Moreover, since maize oil contains particularly high levels of sterols and tocopherols, their delta(13)C values were not significantly altered when groundnut oil was added up to 20% (m/m) and it is possible to use the values for the minor components to predict the values that would be expected in a pure oil; therefore, comparison of the predicted values with those obtained experimentally allows adulteration to be detected. A refinement involved performing a discriminant analysis on the delta(13)C values of the bulk oil and the major fatty acids (16:0, 18:1 and 18:2) and using the Mahalanobis distances to determine the percentage of adulterant oil present. This approach may be refined further by including the delta(13)C values of the minor components in the discriminant analysis thereby increasing the sensitivity of the approach to concentrations at which adulteration would not be attractive economically.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D002247', 'D003314', 'D005227', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D012680', 'D013261', 'D024505', 'D003313']","['Carbon Isotopes', 'Corn Oil', 'Fatty Acids', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sterols', 'Tocopherols', 'Zea mays']",High-resolution detection of adulteration of maize oil using multi-component compound-specific delta13C values of major and minor components and discriminant analysis.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12661024,2003
12641243,"A novel method, which enables the determination of fungal infection with Fusarium graminearum on corn within minutes, is presented. The ground sample was sieved and the particle size fraction between >250 and 100 microm was used for mid-infrared/attenuated total reflection (ATR) measurements. The sample was pressed onto the ATR crystal, and reproducible pressure was applied. After the spectra were recorded, they were subjected to principle component analysis (PCA) and classified using cluster analysis. Observed changes in the spectra reflected changes in protein, carbohydrate, and lipid contents. Ergosterol (for the total fungal biomass) and the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON; a secondary metabolite) of Fusarium fungi served as reference parameters, because of their relevance for the examination of corn based food and feed. The repeatability was highly improved by sieving prior to recording the spectra, resulting in a better clustering in PCA score/score plots. The developed method enabled the separation of samples with a toxin content of as low as 310 microg/kg from noncontaminated (blank) samples.

MCF may potentially be useful as a slow-release agent for volatile compounds because of its ability to sorb chemicals from the atmosphere and to absorb liquids into its porous structure, and because it can be compressed to form a starch plastic. MCF made of high-amylose corn and wheat starches was prepared with or without 2% (w/w) silicone oil (SO) or palmitic acid (PA). The MCF was loaded with 1% of various volatile compounds with vapor pressures ranging from 0.02 to 28 mm. The MCF depressed the vapor pressure from 0.37 to 37% compared to a control containing no MCF. Incorporating SO or PA in the matrix of the MCF had little effect on sorption of volatiles. Compressing MCF at 1.4, 6.9, and 69 MPa made a starch plastic with varying porosity. The vapor transmission rate of various volatile compounds through MCF was positively correlated to the vapor pressure of the test compound but was inversely proportional to the compression force used to form the starch plastic.

12428450,"Aflatoxins are known to be hepatotoxic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic. A positive correlation has been established between the consumption of aflatoxin-contaminated foods and the increased incidence of liver cancer worldwide. A survey of Egyptian corn and corn-based products and by-products shows that the majority of the samples had higher limits of aflatoxin. We have conducted experiments to determine the fate and distribution of aflatoxin during wet-milling process fractions and investigate the aflatoxin destruction during starch conversion to glucose syrup. The present results showed that about half of the aflatoxin content (48.1%) in the infected corn grain was found to be lost in steep liquor, depending upon the aflatoxin type, arranged in the order G1 > G2 > B1 > B2. After wet-milling aflatoxins were distributed into starch, gluten, fiber, and germ. Gluten, fiber, and germ were the most highly contaminated fractions. The loss of aflatoxin during process of starches reached 54.4% in steep water and water process. Although the gluten fraction represents only 9.6% of corn, the higher percentage (25.3%) of aflatoxin was found in this fraction, the fiber and germ account for nearly 29% of the milled corn and contain 11.6% of the aflatoxin. On the other hand, 8.7% of the total aflatoxins in start corn was found in starch fraction which accounts 61% of the milled corn. Aflatoxins G1 and G2 were found lost in higher concentrations compared to the aflatoxin B1 and B2. A higher percentage of AfG1 (86.35%) and AfG2 (78.36%) and a lower percentage of AfB1 (16.3%) and AfB2 (14.7%) were found in starch fraction. The conversion percent of contaminated starch was 89.5% compared with control starch. It can be concluded that aflatoxins were destroyed during starch conversion. Consequently, glucose syrup produced from contaminated starch was found aflatoxin-free.",Die Nahrung,"['D016604', 'D000348', 'D002851', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D005516', 'D005947', 'D006801', 'D006851', 'D006868', 'D008113', 'D013213', 'D003313']","['Aflatoxin B1', 'Aflatoxins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'Glucose', 'Humans', 'Hydrochloric Acid', 'Hydrolysis', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Starch', 'Zea mays']",Distribution of aflatoxins in product and by-products during glucose production from contaminated corn.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000139', 'Q000378', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemically induced', 'metabolism', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12428450,2003
12428011,"In most species, the synthesis of ADP-glucose (Glc) by the enzyme ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) occurs entirely within the plastids in all tissues so far examined. However, in the endosperm of many, if not all grasses, a second form of AGPase synthesizes ADP-Glc outside the plastid, presumably in the cytosol. In this paper, we show that in the endosperm of wheat (Triticum aestivum), the cytosolic form accounts for most of the AGPase activity. Using a combination of molecular and biochemical approaches to identify the cytosolic and plastidial protein components of wheat endosperm AGPase we show that the large and small subunits of the cytosolic enzyme are encoded by genes previously thought to encode plastidial subunits, and that a gene, Ta.AGP.S.1, which encodes the small subunit of the cytosolic form of AGPase, also gives rise to a second transcript by the use of an alternate first exon. This second transcript encodes an AGPase small subunit with a transit peptide. However, we could not find a plastidial small subunit protein corresponding to this transcript. The protein sequence of the purified plastidial small subunit does not match precisely to that encoded by Ta.AGP.S.1 or to the predicted sequences of any other known gene from wheat or barley (Hordeum vulgare). Instead, the protein sequence is most similar to those of the plastidial small subunits from chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) seeds.

Matrix effects were minimized by use of matrix-matched standard curves for quantification of the analyte. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was 30 ng g(-1) in wheat and 20 ng g(-1) in corn. The rapid LC-MS method enabled analysis of the extracts without clean-up, thereby reducing analyte losses, the time required for the analytical procedure, and costs. A factorial design approach was used to examine the effect on extraction efficiency of the main extraction conditions - time, temperature, and solvent. On the basis of results from statistical assessment extraction was performed with 1:1 (v/v) methanol-acetonitrile at 80 degrees C for 5 min. When these extraction conditions were applied to a wheat sample from a recently conducted international proficiency test, 92% (103 ng g(-1)) of the assigned zearalenone concentration (112 ng g(-1)) in the test material was obtained. This result was within the uncertainty (u) range of the assigned value of the test material (u=+/-15.8 ng g(-1), alpha=0.05) thereby demonstrating the accuracy of the method was sufficient.

It is formed during the storage of cereal grains and other plant-derived products. OTA ingested by humans and animals with the food or feed may exert deleterious effects on health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ochratoxin contamination of the most important potential sources of OTA. The OTA content of cereal samples for human consumption (36 baking wheat, 16 wheat flour and 6 maize coarse meal samples) and feed grain samples (30 feeding wheat, 32 feeding maize and 20 feeding barley samples) collected in the mid-phase or at the end of the storage period and of 50 commercial coffee samples was determined. The analyses were performed by immunoaffinity column--high-performance liquid chromatography (IAC-HPLC). The limit of detection of the method was 0.1 ng/g. Of the wheat samples intended for human consumption, 8.3% contained OTA at 0.29 ng/g on the average (OTA ranges: 0.12-0.5 ng/g; Table 2). The OTA contamination of wheat flour and maize meal samples for human consumption was similar to that of the baking wheat samples. OTA contamination was found in 26.7% of the feeding wheat, 15.6% of the feeding maize and 35% of the feeding barley samples. The average values and the ranges of OTA levels found in the above samples were 12.2 and 0.3-62.8 ng/g, 4.9 and 1.9-8.3 ng/g, and 72 and 0.14-212 ng/g, respectively (Table 3). Sixty-six percent of the coffee samples were contaminated with OA (average level: 0.57 ng/g, ranges: 0.17-1.3 ng/g; Table 4). OTA contamination of baking wheat samples was found to be relatively low, presumably as a result of the favourable weather at harvest and the optimal storage conditions. Calculations made on the basis of the obtained results show that the daily OTA intake of an adult human from edible cereals is only 6.7 ng, while the amount taken up with coffee is 4.1 ng daily.

Exposure to aflatoxins has been associated with carcinogenicity. This paper reports a simple, portable, and rapid fluorescence polarization (FP) assay for aflatoxin determination in grains. This immunoassay is field portable, homogeneous, and without any washing and cleaning steps. The assay is based upon the competition between free aflatoxin and an aflatoxin-fluorescein tracer for an aflatoxin-specific monoclonal antibody in solution. A series of naturally contaminated corn, sorghum, peanut butter, and peanut paste samples were analyzed by FP and compared with HPLC results. Similarly, spiked popcorn samples were analyzed by FP. FP results of naturally contaminated samples correlated well with HPLC (r (2) = 0.97). FP analysis of spiked popcorn samples (with a mixture of B(1)/B(2)/G(1)/G(2), 7/1/3/1, w/w) gave a good correlation with spiked values (r (2) = 0.99). However, FP consistently underestimated the aflatoxin contents. This was perhaps due to low cross-reactivity of the antibody used toward B(2), G(1), and G(2) aflatoxins.

Each year, the presence of this compound and related trichothecenes causes substantial losses to agricultural productivity. Rapid methods for the measurement of the toxin in grains are required to monitor and divert effectively contaminated grain from the food supply. A fluorescence polarization (FP) immunoassay using a previously described monoclonal antibody for DON was developed. The assay was based on the competition of unlabeled DON from a sample with a fluorescently tagged DON, DON-fluorescein (DON-FL), for a DON-specific monoclonal antibody in solution. The FP of the tagged DON was increased upon binding with the antibody. In the presence of free toxin, less of the DON-FL was bound and the polarization signal was decreased. The assays were very simple to perform, requiring only mixing of an aqueous extract of wheat with the DON-FL and antibody. The sensitivity of the assay was strongly dependent upon the time between mixing of the sample with the tracer and measurement of the fluorescence polarization, with midpoints for the competition curves ranging from 0.03 microg ml(-1) with a 15-s incubation to >1 microg ml(-1) with a 12-min incubation. Samples of wheat naturally contaminated with DON were evaluated by FP and by an HPLC-UV method, with a good correlation (r2 = 0.97).

The comparison of five extraction solvents is presented. Three solid-phase extraction cartridges (C-18, silica, Florisil) and immuno-affinity columns were also compared to obtain the best recovery of the mycotoxin with the minimal presence of co-extractives in the chromatograms. Mixtures of methanol-1% aqueous NaCl (80.20 or 60:40 v/v) were the best extraction solvents. Florisil provided higher recovery of ZEA than C-18, and silica proved unsuitable. The immuno-affinity column was very efficient in cleaning the extracts, but its sample capacity was lower than that of SPE columns due to saturation. The mobile phase (methanol-water 80:20 v/v) gave a low retention time for ZEA (approximately 5 min), high sensitivity and acceptable separation between this mycotoxin and alpha-zearalenol. The optimized protocol is straightforward, provides high ZEA recoveries in spiked corn (mean 102.4%), has an acceptable sensitivity and has a lack of interference with fluorescence detection (detection limit 4 ng ZEA g(-1) corn).

The objective of the present work was to grow T. molitor larvae under standard conditions, to analyze the chemical composition of the larvae powder, and to prepare supplemented maize tortillas. Protein and fat contents were performed with standard methods. Tenebrio larvae powder had a 58.4% protein content; this protein was rich in essential amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; the found values satisfied those recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Fatty acid composition was determined by GC-MS showing high contents of oleic acid and linoleic acid (19.8 and 8.51%, respectively). A large proportion of unsaturated fatty acids of longer chains was detected. Long-chain fatty acids having two or three double bonds have been claimed as highly beneficial to health.

Samples were extracted in methanol-water (8 + 2, v/v) solution. The filtered extract was diluted with distilled water and applied to immunoaffinity columns. Zearalenone was eluted with methanol, dried by evaporation, and dissolved in acetonitrile-water (3 + 7, v/v). Zearalenone was separated by isocratic elution of acetonitrile-water (50 + 50, v/v) on reversed-phase C18 column. The quantitative analysis was performed by fluorescence detector and confirmation was based on the UV spectrum obtained by a diode array detector. The mean recovery rate of zearalenone was 82-97% (RSD, 1.4-4.1%) on the original (single-use) immunoaffinity columns. The limit of detection of zearalenone by fluorescence was 10 ng/g at a signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1 and 30 ng/g by spectral confirmation in UV. A good correlation was found (R2 = 0.89) between the results obtained by IAC-LC and by the official AOAC-LC method. The specificity of the method was increased by using fluorescence detection in parallel with UV detection. This method was applicable to the determination of zearalenone content in cereals and other kinds of feedstuffs. Reusability of immunoaffinity columns was examined by washing with water after sample elution and allowing columns to stand for 24 h at room temperature.

We developed a microplate method to measure genomic DNA damage in Chinese hamster ovary cells with a modified single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay. This allowed us to measure the repression of 2-acetoxyacetylaminofluorene (2AAAF)-induced DNA damage by very small amounts of complex mixtures, fractions or individual chemicals isolated from agricultural by-products. We previously demonstrated that PCC, an ethanol extract of a commercial soybean processing by-product, repressed induced genomic DNA damage in mammalian cells. PCC was separated into a series of chemically defined fractions and two fractions (PCC70 and PCC100) repressed mutagen-induced damage. Of the isoflavones isolated from soybean fraction PCC70, daidzein expressed antigenotoxic activity, however, genistin and genistein enhanced DNA damage. An antigenotoxic response also was observed with a fraction isolated from corn distillate solids (CDS40). We developed a microplate assay to measure the suppression of the growth rate of human cancer cells in which the cytostatic/cytotoxic status at each concentration of the test sample was quantitatively determined.

11455644,"This paper reviews the discovery of isoxaflutole (IFT), focusing on the chemical and physicochemical properties which contribute to the herbicidal behaviour of this new herbicide. IFT (5-cyclopropyl-1,2-isoxazol-4-yl alpha alpha alpha-trifluoro-2-mesyl-p-tolyl ketone) is a novel herbicide for pre-emergence control of a wide range of important broadleaf and grass weeds in corn and sugarcane. The first benzoyl isoxazole lead was synthesised in 1989 and IFT in 1990, and the herbicidal potential of the latter was identified in 1991. The decision to develop the molecule was taken after two years of field testing in North America. The biochemical target of IFT is 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), inhibition of which leads to a characteristic bleaching of susceptible species. The inhibitor of HPPD is the diketonitrile derivative of IFT formed from opening of the isoxazole ring. The diketonitrile (DKN) is formed rapidly in plants following root and shoot uptake. The DKN is both xylem and phloem mobile leading to high systemicity. IFT also undergoes conversion to the DKN in the soil. The soil half-life of IFT ranges from 12 h to 3 days under laboratory conditions and is dependent on several factors such as soil type, pH and moisture. The log P of IFT is 2.19 and the water solubility is 6.2 mg litre-1, whereas the corresponding values for the DKN are 0.4 and 326 mg litre-1, respectively. These properties restrict the mobility of IFT, which is retained at the soil surface where it can be taken up by surface-germinating weed seeds. The DKN, which has a laboratory soil half-life of 20-30 days, is more mobile and is taken up by the roots. In addition to influencing the soil behaviour of IFT and DKN, the greater lipophilicity of IFT leads to greater uptake by seed, shoot and root tissues. In both plants and soil, the DKN is converted to the herbicidally inactive benzoic acid. This degradation is more rapid in maize than in susceptible weed species and this contributes to the mechanism of selectivity, together with the greater sowing depth of the crop.",Pest management science,"['D015111', 'D001345', 'D019817', 'D001681', 'D002855', 'D004791', 'D006207', 'D006540', 'D007555', 'D015394', 'D010573', 'D018517', 'D018520', 'D010944', 'D012987', 'D012995']","['4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase', 'Autoradiography', 'Benzoic Acid', 'Biological Assay', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Half-Life', 'Herbicides', 'Isoxazoles', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Shoots', 'Plants', 'Soil', 'Solubility']",Isoxaflutole: the background to its discovery and the basis of its herbicidal properties.,"['Q000037', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000032', None]","['antagonists & inhibitors', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11455644,2001

Here we report a simple and reliable method for processing milligram quantities of dried plant material for the analysis of the carbon isotope composition of lipids, soluble sugars, starch and cellulose from the same sample. We evaluated three different starch preparation methods, namely (1) enzymatic hydrolysis by alpha-amylase, (2) solubilization by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) followed by precipitation with ethanol, and (3) partial hydrolysis by HCl followed by precipitation of the resulting dextrins by ethanol. Starch recovery for three commercially available native starches (from potato, rice and wheat) varied from 48 to 81% for the techniques based on precipitation, whereas the enzymatic technique exhibited yields between 99 and 105%. In addition, the DMSO and HCl techniques introduced a significant (13)C fractionation of up to 1.9 per thousand, while the carbon isotope composition of native starches analyzed after enzymatic digestion did not show any significant difference from that of untreated samples. The enzymatic starch preparation method was then incorporated into a protocol for determination of delta(13)C signatures of lipids, soluble carbohydrates, starch and crude cellulose. The procedure is based on methanol/chloroform/water extraction of dried and ground leaf material. After recovery of the chloroform phase (lipid fraction), the methanol/water phase was deionized by ion exchange (soluble carbohydrate fraction) and the pellet treated with heat-stable alpha-amylase (starch fraction).

FB(1) and hydrolyzed FB(1) (HFB(1)) concentrations in four lots of corn and in the masa, other intermediates, liquid and waste byproducts, and fried chips were determined by HPLC. FB(1) concentrations in the masa and chips were reduced significantly, up to 80% in the fried chips, compared to that in the raw corn. HFB(1) was also found in the masa and chips, but at low concentrations compared to FB(1). LC-MS analyses corroborated HPLC findings and further showed the presence of partially hydrolyzed FB(1) (PHFB(1)), which, like HFB(1), was formed during the nixtamalization (cooking/steeping the corn in alkaline water to make masa) step and found predominantly in the cooking/steeping liquid and solid waste. No significant amounts of N-(carboxymethyl)-FB(1) or N-(1-deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-FB(1), indicative of fumonisin-sugar adduct formation, were found. Thus, FB(1) is removed from corn and diverted into liquid and waste byproducts during the commercial production of fried tortilla chips.

11368569,"It is well-known that fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) in corn meal decreases during baking, frying, and cooking, but it is still not exactly clear how heating affects the formation of N-(carboxymethyl)fumonisin B(1) (NCM-FB(1)), the reaction product of FB(1) and reducing sugars. In model experiments corn grits were spiked with FB(1) (2 mg/kg) and D-glucose (50 g/kg) or sucrose (50 g/kg) and manufactured into extrusion products at various temperatures (160--180 degrees C) and moisture levels (16--20%). A liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry method using isotopically labeled fumonisin FB(1)-d(6) as an internal standard was developed for the determination of NCM-FB(1). For sample cleanup solid-phase C18 cartridges were used. The detection limit achieved with this method was 10 ng/g (signal-noise ratio = 3:1) using the protonated molecule [M + H](+) signal of NCM-FB(1) (m/z 780) in the selected ion monitoring mode. Low concentrations of NCM-FB(1) (29-97 ng/g) were detected in all samples spiked with D-glucose and FB(1), whereas those spiked with FB(1) and sucrose showed only NCM-FB(1) in samples produced at 180 degrees C (NCM-FB(1) = 27 ng/g). Various corn-containing food samples from the German market were analyzed for the presence of NCM-FB(1), FB(1), and hydrolyzed fumonisin B(1) (HFB(1)). All samples were contaminated with FB(1) (22--194 ng/g) and HFB(1) (5--247 ng/g). Six of nine samples contained NCM-FB(1) in low concentrations ranging from 10 to 76 ng/g.

The aim of this study was to obtain information about the state-of-the-art of ZON and DON analysis in cereals and to support a knowledge and experience exchange between the participating laboratories in the field of mycotoxin analysis. Eight different sample types were distributed to the participants, 'blank' materials, spiked samples (102 microg/kg ZON in maize and 475 microg/kg DON in wheat) and naturally-contaminated maize and wheat. For the final separation and quantification either gas chromatography (GC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) or enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were employed by the participating laboratories. Coefficients of variation (CV) between laboratory mean results (outliers rejected) ranged from 28 to 41% for ZON and from 32 to 38% for DON. The results are close to the between laboratory CV criteria of 40% for DON and ZON at concentration levels of >100 microg/kg established by the CEN in 1999. A good trueness was obtained for the wheat samples spiked at 475 microg/kg DON. However, a significant deviation at p = 0.01 from the respective target value was observed for the maize samples spiked at 102 microg/kg ZON.

Folic acid was extracted from food samples into a phosphate buffer, purified on a C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge, and analyzed by LC-MS in the negative ion mode using electrospray ionization. The analyte was quantified using (13)C(5)-folic acid as an internal standard. The coefficient of variation for the precision of the method was 5.6% based on the analysis of four sample replicates. The accuracy of the method was assessed using a standard method of addition of folic acid to a shredded whole-wheat cereal. The quantitative determination of folic acid in this matrix was linear over 1 order of magnitude having a concentration range of 2.4 to 24 microg/g of food (or 0.05 to 0.5 microg of analyte injected into the LC-MS). The overall quantitative efficiency of the method was evaluated using a standard reference material (infant formula SRM 1846). The method was applied to the determination of folic acid in several test samples (fortified breakfast cereals), and the values were in accord with the manufacturer's claim.

11304035,"Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is an inhibitor of sphinganine N-acyltransferase and the increase in the sphinganine/ sphingosine (Sa/So) ratio in urine or serum has been proposed as a biomarker to evaluate exposure to fumonisins. The objectives of this study were to (1) develop a liquid chromatographic method sufficiently sensitive to determine the low concentration of free Sa in male human urine, and (2) analyse So and Sa in human urine and monitor the Sa/So ratio in urine of humans exposed to FB1 in corn diets over 1 month. The liquid chromatographic method involved isolation from human urine of exfoliated cells followed by an extraction of free sphingoid bases and their separation and quantification by high performance liquid chromatography. The detection limits for So and Sa were 0.15 ng/ml in female urine (2 ml used) and 0.005 ng/ ml in male urine (60 ml used). Twenty-eight healthy adult volunteers consumed for 1 month a normal diet containing their homegrown corn potentially contaminated with FB1. Immediately preceding the start of the test, morning urine samples for the determination of So and Sa were collected from each person, and the corn samples used in cooking were obtained from each family for the determination of FB1. At the end of the test period, morning-urine samples were collected from each person and analysed again. The daily FB1 intakes were estimated and used to assess the relationship between them and the urinary Sa/So ratios in humans exposed to dietary FB1 over 1 month. All the homegrown corn samples contained FB1 ranging from 0.08 to 41.1 mg/kg, and the estimated daily FB1 intakes ranged from 0.4 to 740 microg/kg b.w./day. The 1-month monitoring results suggest that sphingolipid metabolism of humans could be affected by FB1 intake, the urinary Sa/So ratio may be useful for evaluating FB1 exposure when the contamination of FB1 is high, and that males are more sensitive to FB1 disruption of sphingolipid metabolism than females.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000328', 'D015415', 'D002264', 'D002274', 'D002851', 'D004784', 'D004791', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D037341', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D009183', 'D011493', 'D013110', 'D003313']","['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Carcinogens, Environmental', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Fumonisins', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mycotoxins', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Sphingosine', 'Zea mays']","Determination of sphinganine, sphingosine and Sa/So ratio in urine of humans exposed to dietary fumonisin B1.","[None, 'Q000652', 'Q000008', 'Q000008', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000652', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000008', 'Q000037', 'Q000031', 'Q000737']","[None, 'urine', 'administration & dosage', 'administration & dosage', 'methods', 'methods', 'urine', None, None, None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'analogs & derivatives', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11304035,2001

After testing several factors that may affect the analytical performance, an accurate method for the determination of fumonisin B1 (FB1) and B2 (FB2) in cornflakes has been developed. The method uses immunoaffinity chromatography for clean-up and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for quantification of the toxins. Samples were extracted twice with acetonitrile-methanol-water (25:25:50) and the combined extracts were diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and applied to a FumoniTest immunoaffinity column. After washing with PBS, fumonisins were eluted from the column with methanol and reacted with o-phthaldialdehyde/2-mercaptoethanol to form fluorescent derivatives. Fumonisin derivatives were analysed by reversed phase HPLC with fluorometric detection using methanol-0.1 M phosphate buffer (77:23; pH adjusted at 3.35) as mobile phase.

FB1 was found in about half of the corn flakes, corn snack and popcorn (not popped) samples, whereas FB2 was seen to a lesser extent. Both FB1 and FB2 were found in 75% or more of the corn flour, tacos and polenta samples. In general, the content of FB1 was in the range of 1-1000 micro/kg and the content of FB2 was in the range of 4-250 microg/kg. Corn-based foods are consumed in rather low amounts and irregularly among the Danish population and therefore it is not meaningful to calculate an average daily funonisin intake.

11212548,"In order to optimize the analytical method for the determination of fumonisin B1 (FB1) and fumonisin B2 (FB2) in different maize products, five materials (maize flour, corn flakes, extruded maize, muffins and infant formula) were investigated under a variety of experimental conditions organized in a ruggedness test according to a factorial design. The influence of five factors (extraction solvent, extraction mode, volume of extraction solvent, test sample size and clean-up) on method performances was tested by four laboratories using spiked materials (0.5 microgram/g and 1.5 micrograms/g FB1 + FB2) and naturally contaminated materials (ca 1.5 micrograms/g with FB1 + FB2). The end determination step was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the o-phthaldialdehyde derivatized extracts. The ruggedness test permitted identification of two critical factors in the analysis of fumonisins in the above products, namely 'extraction solvent' and 'clean-up procedure'. In particular, the use of acetonitrile (ACN)-water (1 + 1, v + v) as extraction solvent and immunoaffinity column for clean-up provided better recovery of fumonisins and chromatographic resolution as compared with methanol (MeOH)-water (3 + 1, v + v) and strong anion exchange (SAX), respectively. However, phase separation occurring after extraction with ACN-water may have given incorrect results.

11029710,"Proteins that interact with the actin cytoskeleton often modulate the dynamics or organization of the cytoskeleton or use the cytoskeleton to control their localization. In plants, very few actin-binding proteins have been identified and most are thought to modulate cytoskeleton function. To identify actin-binding proteins that are unique to plants, the development of new biochemical procedures will be critical. Affinity columns using actin monomers (globular actin, G-actin) or actin filaments (filamentous actin, F-actin) have been used to identify actin-binding proteins from a wide variety of organisms. Monomeric actin from zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) hypocotyl tissue was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and shown to be native and competent for polymerization to actin filaments. G-actin, F-actin and bovine serum albumin affinity columns were prepared and used to separate samples enriched in either soluble or membrane-associated actin-binding proteins. Extracts of soluble actin-binding proteins yield distinct patterns when eluted from the G-actin and F-actin columns, respectively, leading to the identification of a putative F-actin-binding protein of approximately 40 kDa. When plasma membrane-associated proteins were applied to these columns, two abundant polypeptides eluted selectively from the F-actin column and cross-reacted with antiserum against pea annexins. Additionally, a protein that binds auxin transport inhibitors, the naphthylphthalamic acid binding protein, which has been previously suggested to associate with the actin cytoskeleton, was eluted in a single peak from the F-actin column.

Quantitation was carried out using labeled fumonisin FB(1)-D(6) as an internal standard. The detection limits achieved with this method were 8 ng/g for HFB(1) (signal-noise ratio = 5:1) and 5 ng/g for FB(1) (s/n = 5:1) using the protonated molecule signals m/z 406 and 722 in the SIM mode.

Current studies revealed that heat treatment (over the range of 100-175 degrees C) of corn fiber in either a convection oven or a vacuum oven caused only a modest reduction in the levels of the phytosterol components. However, these same heat pretreatments caused a considerable increase (up to 10-fold) in the levels (increasing from 0.34 wt % to a maximum of 3.64 wt % gamma-tocopherol in the oil) and yields (increasing from 5.4 mg of gamma-tocopherol/100 g of corn fiber to a maximum of 52.1 mg of gamma-tocopherol/100 g of corn fiber) of gamma-tocopherol in corn fiber oil. The main differences between the convection oven and vacuum oven pretreatments were associated with the disappearance of free fatty acids and free phytosterols at the higher temperature pretreatments in the vacuum oven, probably due to the lower boiling points of these lipids.

We have compared the functional properties of two LTPs purified from maize and wheat seeds knowing that, despite a high degree of sequence identity, the two proteins exhibit structural differences. It was found that wheat LTP had a lower transfer activity than the maize LTP, consistent with a lower kinetics of fatty acid binding. The lower affinity for the fatty acids of the wheat LTP could be explained by a narrowing occurring in the middle part of the binding site, as revealed by comparing the fluorescence spectra of various anthroyloxy-labeled fatty acids associated with the two LTPs. The affinity for some natural fatty acids was studied by competition with fluorescent fatty acids toward binding to the protein. Again, wheat LTP had a lower affinity for those molecules.

Sample preparation was performed by extraction of the commodities with a mixture of acetonitrile and water followed by solid-phase extraction with RP-18 columns or immunoaffinity columns. The selective determination of ZON was achieved with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. Using the negative ion mode a detection limit of 0.5 microg/kg and a determination limit of 1 microg/kg grain was achieved, which is by a factor of 100 more sensitive than the positive ion mode. Zearalanone (ZAN), which does not occur in nature, was used as internal standard for quantification. A linear working range from 1.0 microg/kg to 1000 microg/kg could be achieved in grains with a standard deviation of 4% and recovery rates around 100%. All these results were independent from the grain matrices (maize, barley, oats, wheat) when ZAN was used as internal standard.

The gus gene coding for beta-glucuronidase (rGUS) was stably integrated and expressed over four generations. The accumulation level of rGUS reached 0.4% of total extractable protein. Within the kernel, rGUS was preferentially accumulated in the germ even though a constitutive ubiquitin promoter was used to direct gus expression. Fourth-generation transgenic seed was used to investigate the effect of seed processing on the activity and the recovery of rGUS. Transgenic seed containing rGUS could be stored at an ambient temperature for up to two weeks and for at least three months at 10 degrees C without a significant loss of enzyme activity. rGUS exposed to dry heat was more stable in ground than in whole kernels. The enzyme stability was correlated with the moisture loss of the samples during the heating. Transgenic seed was dry-milled, fractionated, and hexane extracted to produce full-fat and defatted germ fractions. The results of the aqueous extraction of rGUS from ground kernels, full-fat germ, and defatted-germ samples revealed that approximately 10 times more rGUS per gram of solids could be extracted from the ground full-fat germ and defatted-germ than from the kernel samples. The extraction of corn oil from ground germ with hot hexane (60 degrees C) did not affect the extractable rGUS activity. rGUS was purified from ground kernels and full-fat germ extracts by ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatography. Similar purity and yield of rGUS were obtained from both extracts. Biochemical properties of rGUS purified from transgenic corn seed were similar to those of E. coli GUS.",Biotechnology and bioengineering,"['D000821', 'D004795', 'D004926', 'D005523', 'D005966', 'D030821', 'D011994', 'D012639', 'D003313']","['Animal Feed', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Escherichia coli', 'Food Supply', 'Glucuronidase', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Seeds', 'Zea mays']",Processing of transgenic corn seed and its effect on the recovery of recombinant beta-glucuronidase.,"[None, None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000096', 'Q000201', 'Q000096', 'Q000201', 'Q000201']","[None, None, 'enzymology', None, 'biosynthesis', 'enzymology', 'biosynthesis', 'enzymology', 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10099404,1999

Frying, autoclaving and extrusion were examined with naturally-contaminated maize meal, maize flour and sweet maize kernels, all at two fumonisin concentrations. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography determination of fumonisins B1 and B2 and hydrolized fumonisin B1 (AP1) were performed in unprocessed materials and at the end of the experimental runs. Reductions of fumonisins concentration in processed products were obtained for fried polenta and from one of the two runs of extruded maize batter. These reductions were consistent with previous studies of the thermal degradation of fumonisins. Autoclaving sweet maize kernels apparently resulted in reductions of fumonisin concentrations that were highly temperature dependent, but this needs further study.

Thus, Cd burden of the people in the city tended to be greater than that for those in the village. Nevertheless, the Cd burden of the Jinan citizens was lower than the values published for people in large cities in China. When Cd intake via the four cereals was compared with Cd in total food to estimate the total contribution of the four cereals (combined) in total dietary Cd intake, the cereals accounted for 60% of total dietary Cd intake among the city people and as high as 78% among the villagers.

9687479,"Beauvericin is a cyclohexadepsipeptide mycotoxin which has insecticidal properties and which can induce apoptosis in mammalian cells. Beauvericin is produced by some entomo- and phytopathogenic Fusarium species (Fusarium proliferatum, F. semitectum, and F. subglutinans) and occurs naturally on corn and corn-based foods and feeds infected by Fusarium spp. We tested 94 Fusarium isolates belonging to 25 taxa, 21 in 6 of the 12 sections of the Fusarium genus and 4 that have been described recently, for the ability to produce beauvericin. Beauvericin was produced by the following species (with the number of toxigenic strains compared with the number of tested strains given in parentheses): Fusarium acuminatum var. acuminatum (1 of 4), Fusarium acuminatum var. armeniacum (1 of 3), F. anthophilum (1 of 2), F. avenaceum (1 of 6), F. beomiforme (1 of 1), F. dlamini (2 of 2), F. equiseti (2 of 3), F. longipes (1 of 2), F. nygamai (2 of 2), F. oxysporum (4 of 7), F. poae (4 of 4), F. sambucinum (12 of 14), and F. subglutinans (3 of 3).

In addition, they offered raw (uncooked) rice as well as wheat flour and maize starch from the kitchen. Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in food duplicates and blood samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after homogenization (when necessary) and wet-ashing. The consumption of rice, wheat and maize was calculated by weighing each food item in the duplicates taking advantage of the food composition tables. The dietary exposure level of the women was 11 micrograms Pb/day and 14 micrograms Cd/day, and the levels of Pb and Cd in their blood were 37 ng Pb/ml and 0.47 ng Cd/ml. There is a subtle age-dependent increase in the dietary burden of Pb and Cd and also in blood levels of Pb and Cd. Rice accounted for 18 and 21% of dietary Pb and Cd intake, respectively and cereals (i.e. rice, wheat and maize in combination) accounted for 24% both for Pb and Cd. The calculation from the published data on air quality in Manila suggested that another and yet a greater source of Pb burden was Pb in atmospheric air which may account for 85% of total Pb uptake, whereas the amount of Cd in air was quite small (i.e. < 10% of the total uptake).",The Science of the total environment,"['D000328', 'D000367', 'D002104', 'D003625', 'D002523', 'D004781', 'D005260', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D007854', 'D013058', 'D012275', 'D010679']","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cadmium', 'Data Collection', 'Edible Grain', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Lead', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oryza', 'Philippines']","Non-occupational exposure of adult women in Manila, the Philippines, to lead and cadmium.","[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9599459,1998

Fumonisin B1 was found to occur in 70-73% of the mouldy samples. The mycotoxin level increased from year to year: the highest fumonisin B1 concentration was 75.1 mg/kg. The samples that were mould-free on visual inspection showed a much lower prevalence of fumonisin B1 contamination (30%) and contained fumonisin B1 in markedly lower concentrations (average, 1.52 mg/kg; maximum concentration, 5.1 mg/kg). Using the Fusarium moniliforme strain designated 14/A, isolated from the sample that had the highest mycotoxin concentrations, fumonisin B1 toxin was produced on maize by an internationally accepted procedure. Subsequently, two weaned piglets were fed a diet containing 330 mg fumonisin B1 per kg of feed. The experimental animals developed hydrothorax and pulmonary oedema, and died in 5-6 days. The clinical symptoms and pathological lesions were consistent with those of porcine pulmonary oedema (PPE) diagnosed in the USA in 1989-1990, as well as with those of a disease entity that had already been described in Hungary in the 1950s as the so-called fattening or unique pulmonary oedema of pigs but considered to be of unknown aetiology.

The mycotoxins are aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2, ochratoxins A and B, citrinin, cyclopiazonic acid, zearalenone, sterigmatocystin, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol together with seven related trichothecene mycotoxins, fumonisins B1 and B2 and moniliformin. For most of the mycotoxins, recoveries obtained were 60% or greater and reproducibility data were better than +/- 40%. In general, the analysis of maize gluten proved more difficult than for other maize products. In total 40 samples of maize gluten, and 27 samples of other maize products were examined. Aflatoxins were not found above the reporting limit (1-5 micrograms/kg) in any sample while ochratoxin A was detected in only two samples of maize gluten at 2 micrograms/kg. No sterigmatocystin or cyclopiazonic acid were detected although the limits of detection for these toxins were poor. Twenty percent of maize gluten samples contained zearalenone at up to 500 micrograms/kg while all other maize products also contained this mycotoxin. Highest levels occurred in screenings and meal while the lowest amounts were in flaked maize and germ. Many samples contained a multi-toxin mixture of trichothecenes, fumonisins and moniliformin. The most highly contaminated samples of maize screenings and maize meal contained a mixture of zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fumonisin B1 and B2, moniliformin, each in mg/kg amounts and lower amounts of other trichothecenes such as 15-acetoxy deoxynivalenol, HT-2 toxin and T-2 toxin.

In subjects who ingested CP, the blood ethanol level was lower than that in the WP, alanine and leucine ingestion groups, but did not decrease as compared to the control when they ingested PP. Similarly there was a difference in the blood ethanol level between alanine and leucine ingestion groups, and leucine ingestion was more effective than alanine against the reduction of the increase in blood ethanol level. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the plasma concentrations of individual amino acids except alanine, leucine, or lysine after alcohol intake among experimental groups as compared to the control. CP ingestion significantly elevated plasma alanine and leucine rather than other groups during a 2-h observation period. These results suggested that CP may have the effect on the reduction of increase in blood ethanol level after alcohol intake by the marked elevation of plasma alanine and leucine, especially leucine, but neither by the delay of ethanol release from the stomach nor malabsorption of ethanol in the gastrointestinal tracts.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","['D000328', 'D000409', 'D002492', 'D002851', 'D000431', 'D006801', 'D007930', 'D008297', 'D009842', 'D018532', 'D014674', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Adult', 'Alanine', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ethanol', 'Humans', 'Leucine', 'Male', 'Oligopeptides', 'Peas', 'Plant Proteins, Dietary', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",The effects of corn peptide ingestion on facilitating alcohol metabolism in healthy men.,"[None, 'Q000494', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'pharmacology', 'blood', None, 'blood', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9339548,1998

Treatment of seeds with the herbicide safener fluxofenim increased the total GST activity extracted from T. aestivum shoots 9-fold when assayed with dimethenamid as a substrate, but had no effect on glutathione levels. Total GST activity in crude protein extracts from T. aestivum, Triticum durum, and Triticum tauschii was separated into several component GST activities by anion-exchange fast-protein liquid chromatography. These activities (isozymes) differed with respect to their activities toward dimethenamid or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrates and in their levels of induction by safener treatment. A safener-induced GST isozyme was subsequently purified by anion-exchange and affinity chromatography from etiolated shoots of the diploid wheat species T. tauschii (a progenitor of hexaploid wheat) treated with the herbicide safener cloquintocet-mexyl.

9251171,"Fumonisins are secondary metabolites of the fungus Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon, a common corn contaminant world wide. Presently 6 different fumonisins (FB1, FB2, FB3, FB4, FA1 and FA2) have been identified and characterized. In veterinary medicine fumonisins cause equine leucoencephalomalacia and swine pulmonary edema. In addition, fumonisins have been shown to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals and have been linked to human esophageal cancer in South Africa and China. In this study we examined the prevalence of FB1, FB2 and FB3 in corn-based human foods in Kansas using HPLC equipped with a fluorescent detector. All 3 fumonisins were detected in at least 1 food item. However, only 24/121 samples analyzed (20%), contained detectable (> 40 ppb) fumonisins. Corn flour was the most frequently contaminated as 13/25 items (52%) were positive for fumonisins. For all analyzed human foods, the range of fumonisins was 42-350 ppb in comparison to 765-9953 ppb found in corn meant for animal consumption. This data shows that corn flour is the item most likely to be contaminated with low concentrations of fumonisins.

Distribution of the three toxins follows a pattern reasonably expected from their physical solubility characteristics. The highly water-soluble mycotoxins, NIV and DON, were found at high concentrations (up to 8.8 mg/kg) in concentrated steep liquor (CSL) fractions, but at low levels (less than 0.3 mg/kg) in the solid (germ, fibre and gluten) fractions. The converse was true for ZEN, which is relatively insoluble in water. For ZEN, the maximum concentration found in CSL was 0.6 mg/kg compared with 2.2-4.8 mg/kg in germ, fibre and gluten fractions. Accordingly, an animal food byproduct composed mainly of pressed fibre and concentrated steep liquor was usually found to contain concentrations of all three mycotoxins above those existing in the input maize. A single sample of corn oil recovered during the study also had a high concentration (4.6 mg/kg) of ZEN.

9135724,"Extracts, isolated through sequential fractionation and partition procedures described previously (Martinez et al. 1994) from aflatoxin-free corn and aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment, were investigated for mutagenic potential using the Ames test (TA 100 tester strain). 2-Aminofluorene (2-AF) and pure aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) were used as positive controls. Although TA100 showed mutagenic response to pure AFB1 at a dose of ca 10 ng/plate, all isolates tested from ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn containing 7500 ng AFB1/g did not exhibit positive results in the Ames test. Additionally, isolates from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn failed to give positive mutagenic potentials. These results indicate that differences between the mutagenic potentials of pure aflatoxins and of aflatoxins in naturally-contaminated corn exist. CH2Cl2 extracts (the fractions containing aflatoxins) obtained from aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment were applied to preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) in an effort to separate aflatoxins and/or ammonia/aflatoxin reaction products from the ""unknown interfering materials' existing in the corn matrix. Each of the fractions separated by TLC was tested by the Ames test with S9 activation and none of them gave a mutagenic response to TA100. CH2Cl2 extracts in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) obtained from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-free corn were spiked with pure AFB1 and tested by TA100 with S9 activation. Again, no positive responses were observed. These findings provide further evidence of ""unknown interfering materials' in corn which may bind with aflatoxin and/or can be extracted by CH2Cl2 together with aflatoxin, and, therefore, block the mutagenic activity of aflatoxin in the Ames test.

8885322,"Treatment of fumonisin B1 (FB1)-contaminated corn with calcium hydroxide solution is known to cause large losses of FB1 and formation of the aminopentol AP1 by hydrolysis. Methodology was developed for determination of AP1 in foods manufactured from calcium hydroxide-processed corn. The ground food (tortilla chips, nacho chips, taco shells, or air-dried corn tortillas) was extracted with methanol-water (8:2) or methanol-acetonitrile-water (25:25:50), which also extracted FB1 and fumonisin B2 (FB2). Clean-up for fumonisin determination was carried out on a 1 ml strong anion exchange (SAX) solid phase extraction (SPE) column. The water wash from this column, containing AP1, was cleaned up on a 1 ml C-18 SPE column. AP1 and, separately, FB1 and FB2 were determined as their o-phthaldialdehyde-mercaptoethanol (OPA/MCE) and, in some cases, 4-fluoro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD-F) derivatives by gradient reverse phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Recoveries of AP1, FB1 and FB2 from spiked samples were generally satisfactory, but FB1 and FB2 recoveries were low with some samples.

A small portion (5.1%) of the samples was found to be contaminated with high levels ( > 1 microgram/g) of type A TCTCs and total DON during the whole survey. Over 40% of the samples had 100 to 1,000 ng of total DON per g, while 17% of the samples had the same levels of type A TCTCs. The analytical data were consistent with those from mycological examinations for the samples in which various toxic Fusarium spp., including F. sporotrichioides, F. poae, and F. graminearum, were found. The samples received in November 1992 had relatively low concentrations of toxin; the average levels of type A TCTCs and total DON were 9.9 and 79 ng/g, respectively. The toxin concentrations became progressively higher in the samples received in December. The average levels for the type A TCTCs and total DON increased to 920 and 335 ng/g, respectively. However, the levels of ZE were higher in the samples collected earlier. The average levels for samples collected in November and late December were 1,195 and 242 ng/g, respectively. Analysis of selected samples by high-performance liquid chromatography monitoring with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol, neosolaniol, and T-2 tetraol (T-2-4ol) were common in these samples. Statistical analysis revealed a weak correlation between the levels of total type A TCTCs and total DON in the samples (r = 0.18, P = 0.09), but a strong correlation between the levels of ZE and total type B TCTCs (r = 0.75, P < 0.0001) was found.

Of the mouldy maize samples collected in the period of storage, 70.8% contained fumonisin B1 (0.05-19.8 mg/kg; average concentration: 2.6 mg/kg), 87.5% contained zearalenone (0.01-11.8 mg/kg, average concentration: 1.26 mg/kg), 70% contained deoxynivalenol (0.07-21.2, average concentration: 4.33 mg/kg), and 41.7% contained T-2 toxin (0.06-0.39, average concentration: 0.2 mg/kg). These mycotoxins often occurred together in the samples. In the non-mouldy samples, both the positivity rate and the mycotoxin concentration were markedly lower. In the harvesting period, the mycotoxin content of maize ears more or less affected by moulds (so-called ""affected sample"") and of the average sample was determined separately for each maize-field involved in the study. Of the affected samples, 70% contained fumonisin B1 (0.095-52.4 mg/kg; average: 6.64 mg/kg), 17% contained zearalenone (0.006-0.079 mg/kg; average: 0.03 mg/kg), 13% contained deoxynivalenol (0.05-0.118 mg/kg; average: 0.09 mg/kg), and 39% contained T-2 toxin (0.05-0.551 mg/kg; average: 0.165 mg/kg).

The results call attention to the fact that maize cultivated in Hungary is often contaminated with fumonisin B1. High concentrations of fumonisin B1 were found primarily in the mouldy or affected maize ears; therefore, the development of diseases caused by fumonisin B1 should be reckoned with primarily if such maize is fed. Besides fumonisin B1, mouldy or affected maize usually contains also other fusariotoxins, which raises the possibility of mycotoxin interactions. Because of the high prevalence of fumonisin B1 in maize grown in Hungary, the authors suggest that samples of maize used for feeding horses and pigs should be checked for fumonisin B1 content.",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,"['D005506', 'D037341', 'D006814', 'D009183', 'D003313']","['Food Contamination', 'Fumonisins', 'Hungary', 'Mycotoxins', 'Zea mays']",Data on the contamination of maize with fumonisin B1 and other fusariotoxins in Hungary.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8826699,1996

Significant relationships were detected between the abundances of sandflies and aphids, suggesting aphid honeydew as a potential food source. Sugar meal analysis, using high-performance anion exchange (HPAE) chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) and the cold anthrone test, was used to demonstrate that significantly more sandflies fed on bean plants contaminated with aphids and honeydew than on uncontaminated beans. Furthermore, higher concentrations of sugars were detected in flies which fed on aphid/honeydew-contaminated beans, suggesting that sugar was more easily available and/or that honeydew/aphids act as phagostimulants for sandflies. Amongst wild sandflies collected from a bean field, significantly more female sandflies were 'sugar-positive' than males, though the sugar concentrations in positive sandflies were similar for both sexes.

7766567,"Although theoretically all glycoprotein sugars can be derived from glucose, it may be hypothesized that specific dietary sugars could be preferential substrates for glycoprotein synthesis. To test this hypothesis, groups of rats received either continuously (continuous-labelling experiment) or for a single nutritional period (pulse-labelling experiment) a 13C-rich diet containing either maize starch or artificially labelled [13C]glucose. Some groups of rats were also provided during a single nutritional period with low amounts (20-200 mg/animal) of low-13C dietary sugars (mannose, galactose, fucose or fructose). If specific dietary sugars were preferentially incorporated into glycoproteins instead of glucose-derived labelled sugars, a decrease would be expected in the intestinal or serum glycoprotein-sugar 13C enrichment monitored by gas chromatography-isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS). Contrary to this hypothesis the results showed no significant decrease with any of the specific dietary sugars. Furthermore, with dietary low-13C mannose or galactose, a significant increase in 13C enrichment of glycoprotein-sugars was observed compared with some other nutritional groups. Moreover, in the pulse-labelling experiment, dietary mannose and galactose induced similar patterns of 13C enrichment in intestinal and serum glycoprotein-sugars. Therefore, although specific dietary sugars do not appear to be preferential substrates for glycosylation under conditions and doses relevant to current concepts of nutrition, regulatory roles of some specific dietary sugars in relation to glycoprotein-sugar metabolism might be hypothesized.

System performance was maximal with uncoated columns. System efficiencies of approximately 44,000 plates/m and reproducible analysis times of about 13 min were obtained. System efficiency with methyl-coated columns was approximately 24,000 plates/m. Reproducible analysis times of about 3.5 min were obtained with these columns. With uncoated columns, the concentration limit of detection was 156 ppb with a s/n ratio of approximately 10. The estimated injected mass at 156 ppb was 1.1 pg. Repeated injections of extracts containing constant fumonisin B1 concentrations showed that peak areas were slightly inconsistent, although generally similar to variations encountered with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The source of this inconsistency was traced to sample solubility, errors inherent in electrophoresis injections, and electrospray instability.

7542129,"Fusaric acid is produced by several species of Fusarium, which commonly infect corn and other agricultural commodities. Since this mycotoxin may augment the effects of other Fusarium toxins, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method of analysis in feeds was developed. Fusaric acid was analyzed as the trimethylsilyl-ester from F. moniliforme-cultures, -contaminated corn screenings, and feeds toxic to livestock. The mycotoxin was found in all samples and ranged from 0.43 to 12.39 micrograms/g sample. Also, fusaric acid was tested for its neurochemical effects in the brain and pineal gland of rats. Animals were dosed intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg body weight) 30 min prior to the onset of the dark phase (lights out) and the effects were studied at 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5 h after treatment. Brain serotonin (5HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), tyrosine (TYRO), and dopamine (DA) were increased (P < 0.05) by fusaric acid, and norepinephrine (NEpi) was decreased (P < 0.05). Analogously, DA in the pineal gland increased and NEpi decreased (P < 0.05). Pineal N-acetylserotonin (NAc5HT) was increased (P < 0.05), whereas pineal 5HT and its two major metabolites 5HIAA and 5-hydroxytryptophol (5HTOL) decreased (P < 0.05). Elevated brain TYRO and brain and pineal DA, with decreased NEpi, may be consistent with fusaric acid's partial inhibitory effect on tyrosine-hydroxylase and its inhibitory effect on dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, respectively. Elevated pineal Nac5HT is consistent with decreased pineal 5HT and the increased pineal DA, and support the dopaminergic stimulatory activity of the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 5HT to NAc5HT. This is the first report of fusaric acid's in vivo effect on pineal DA, NEpi, 5HT, and NAc5HT in rats, and a relation for the effects on TYRO, 5HT, and 5HIAA in brain tissue.

We have identified the enzyme product as poly(ADP-ribose) by purification and electrophoresis on a DNA sequencing gel. This reveals a polymer ladder consisting of up to 45 residues.

The optimum pH of the plant enzyme is greater than pH 7.0 in pea, wheat and maize; the optimum temperature for enzyme activity is approximately 15 degrees C. The Km for NAD+ for the enzyme from maize is estimated to be approximately 50 microM under optimal conditions. Several compounds (nicotinamide, deoxythymidine, 3-aminobenzamide, 3-methoxybenzamide and 5-bromodeoxyuridine) that specifically inhibit the animal enzyme also inhibit the enzyme from plants. The ratio of the IC50 for 5-bromodeoxyuridine to the IC50 for 3-aminobenzamide in maize is similar to that of the animal enzyme indicating that the enzyme involved is poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and not mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase.

There was highly significant difference in the contamination of DON in wheat produced in different areas and years, with a P-value less than 0.01 by ANOVA, but no significant difference in corn (P > 0.1).

8347425,"Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon is a common fungal contaminant of corn and produces a variety of mycotoxins. Among these are the recently discovered fumonisins, which are now known to cause certain animal diseases, namely leukoencephalomalacia in horses and pulmonary edema in swine. There is a significant association between their presence in corn and human esophageal cancer in southern Africa. Fumonisin B1 causes liver cancer in rats. Five other fumonisins--B2, B3, B4, A1 and A2, have been isolated; the last two are N-acetates of fumonisins B1 and B2 and do not appear to be toxic. Several other Fusarium species are now known to produce fumonisins. Procedures for detection and determination of fumonisins include thin layer chromatography, liquid chromatography (with fluorescence derivatization), post-hydrolysis gas chromatography, immunochemical assay, and mass spectrometry. In addition to their natural occurrence in corn-based animal feeds and in home-grown African corn used for food, fumonisins are frequently found in commercial corn-based foods.

Ground barley, ground corn and dried sugar beet pulp were used as concentrate sources. Chopped winter wheat straw was fed as roughage source. All rations were supplemented with a protein-mineral-vitamin-premix. In sacco dry matter degradability of artificially dried ryegrass, untreated and ammonia treated wheat straw was measured within three rumen fistulated sheep. Nylon bags were incubated for 48 h in the rumen of sheep. Volatile fatty acids of rumen fluid were determined by gas chromatography. Samples were taken via rumen fistula 3 h after morning feeding. Apparent digestibility of organic matter and fibre fractions of total rations were determined within five sheep. Increased concentrate portion decreased in sacco dry matter degradability of incubated roughages. Decrease of dry matter degradability was much higher for ammonia treated (from 55.0 to 22.5%) and untreated straw (from 50.9 to 22.7%) than for ryegrass (from 75.6 to 69.2%), when concentrate increased from 0 to 100% of ration. The highest concentrate portions did not show any increase of degradability of ammonia treated straw. Specific concentrate effects were observed when 75 and 100% concentrate were fed (unphysiological level). Ground barley as concentrate source decreased rumen pH to a larger extent (down to 5.18) than corn and sugar beet pulp (down to 5.60 and 5.57). Sheep suffered from rumen acidosis in some cases. Higher concentrate levels increased concentration of total volatile fatty acids of rumen liquid and molar concentration of propionate and butyrate, but decreased acetate.

Finely ground samples were extracted with acetonitrile:water (1:1), filtered, and applied to C18 cleanup columns. The columns were washed with 1% aqueous KCl followed by acetonitrile: 1% aqueous KCl (1:9), and the fumonisins were eluted with acetonitrile:water (7:3). The eluants were concentrated and spotted on reverse-phase C18 TLC plates along with fumonisin B1 and B2 standards, and the plates were developed in methanol: 4% aqueous KCl (3:2). The fumonisins were visualized by spraying the TLC plates successively with 0.1 M sodium borate buffer, fluorescamine, and 0.01 M boric acid. The plates were then dried and examined under longwave ultraviolet light. Fumonisin B1 and B2 appeared as bright yellowish-green fluorescent bands at Rfs of 0.5 and 0.1, respectively. The detection limit for the fumonisins on the TLC plate was 0.1 ppm in corn. Recoveries from spiked samples averaged greater than 80%.

The physical parameters tested were: test weight (TW), endosperm texture (TE), pearling index (IP), 1000 kernel wt (W 1000), infrared reflectance (NIR) and color (Ref). The chemical parameters tested were: protein content (Prt), lysine content (Lis) and tryptophan content (Trp).

R., and Ravel, J. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11228-11232). One form, designated eIF-4F, is a complex containing two subunits, p220 and p26. The other form, designated eIF-(iso)4F, is a complex containing two subunits, p82 and p28, which are antigenically distinct from the subunits of eIF-4F. Both the p26 subunit of eIF-4F and the p28 subunit of eIF-(iso)4F are m7G cap-binding proteins. In this investigation, affinity-purified antibodies to the p220 and p26 subunits of wheat germ eIF-4F and to the p82 and p28 subunits of wheat germ eIF-(iso)4F were used to determine if isozyme forms of eIF-4F are present in maize and cauliflower. Extracts from wheat germ, maize root tips, and cauliflower inflorescences were partially purified by adsorption on m7GTP-Sepharose and elution with m7GTP (MGS eluate). Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies to the subunits of the wheat germ factors showed that the MGS eluate from maize contains polypeptides that react with antibodies to the p82 and p28 subunits of wheat eIF-(iso)4F, as well as polypeptides that react with antibodies to the p220 and p26 subunits of wheat eIF-4F. The MGS eluate from cauliflower also contains polypeptides that reacted with antibodies to the subunits of wheat eIF-(iso)4F. These results indicate that both maize and cauliflower contain the isozyme form of eIF-4F.

One of the major risk factors for this disease is exposure to dietary aflatoxins, and the development of appropriate molecular dosimetry biomarkers would facilitate the identification of individuals at risk. This study was undertaken to explore the relationship between dietary intake of aflatoxins and the excretion of the major aflatoxin-DNA adduct and other metabolites into the urine of chronically exposed people. The following protocol was developed for this investigation in Guangxi Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China, where the diets of 30 males and 12 females (ages, 25-64 years) were monitored for 1 week and aflatoxin intake levels determined each day. Starting on the fourth day, total urine volumes were obtained in consecutive 12-h fractions for 3 or 4 days. High performance liquid chromatography and competitive radioimmunoassay analyses were done on each of the urine samples, and the relationships between excretion of total aflatoxin metabolites, aflatoxin-N7-guanine, aflatoxin M1, aflatoxin P1, and aflatoxin B1, and aflatoxin B1 intake values were determined. The average intake of aflatoxin B1 by men was 48.4 micrograms/day, giving a total mean exposure during the study period of 276.8 micrograms. The average daily intake by women was 77.4 micrograms/day, resulting in a total average exposure during the 7-day period of 542.6 micrograms aflatoxin B1. Initial efforts to characterize aflatoxin metabolites in urine samples were with an analysis by competitive radioimmunoassay. The analysis by linear regression of the association between aflatoxin B1 intake/day and total aflatoxin metabolite excretion/day showed a correlation coefficient of only 0.26. These findings stimulated the immunoaffinity/analytical high performance liquid chromatography analysis for individual metabolites. When the data were analyzed by linear regression analysis, the aflatoxin N7-guanine excretion and aflatoxin B1 intake from the previous day showed a correlation coefficient of 0.65 and P less than 0.000001.

Six states were identified as having serious aflatoxin contamination in their corn crop: Virginia, North and South Carolina, Texas, Iowa, and Illinois. Swine liver and pillars of diaphragm (muscle) tissues were sampled by federal FSIS Inspectors in plants located in these states. A worstcase sampling plan was conducted. Samples were taken in January 1989 from hogs fed corn soon after harvest and in April 1989 from hogs fed corn originally stored and then fed in the spring.

High-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that 3.6% of the 194 blood samples collected in February and March and 4.2% of the 1006 collected in May, June and July had concentrations of ochratoxin A that exceeded 20 ng/ml. In a subsequent survey of porcine blood carried out in 1989-90, 16-65% of the samples had detectable levels of ochratoxin A, at mean concentrations of 5.4-19.4 ng/ml. Subsequently, human blood samples were collected from 159 individuals, 69 of whom had some form of renal impairment. Of the latter, 40% had detectable levels of ochratoxin A, and 12% had concentrations greater than 0.5 ng/ml. Of the non-renal patients, 39% had detectable levels of ochratoxin A, and 11% had concentrations greater than 0.5 ng/ml.

In a segregating population of barley, cv Herta (Cb 3014), containing the recessive slender allele, (sln 1) the concentration of GA(1) and GA(3) was reduced by 10-fold and 6-fold, respectively, in rapidly growing homozygous slender, compared with normal, leaf sheath segments. However, the concentration of the C(20) precursor, GA(19), was nearly 2-fold greater in slender than in normal seedlings. There was little difference in the ABA content of sheath segments between the two genotypes. The gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor, paclobutrazol, reduced the final sheath length of normal segregants (50% inhibition at 15 micromolar) but had no effect on the growth of slender seedlings at concentrations below 100 micromolar. There was a 15-fold and 4-fold reduction in GA(1) and GA(3), respectively, in sheath segments of 8-day-old normal seedlings following application of 10 micromolar paclobutrazol. The same treatment also reduced the already low concentrations of these gibberellins in slender segregants. The results show that the pool sizes of gibberellins A(1) and A(3) are small in slender barley and that leaf sheath extension in this genotype appears to be gibberellin-independent. The relationship between gibberellin status and tissue growth-rate in slender barley is contrasted with other gibberellin nonresponsive, but dwarf, mutants of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and maize (Zea mays).",Plant physiology,[],[],Comparison of gibberellins in normal and slender barley seedlings.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16667686,2010

Twelve raw and roasted peanut and corn portions containing various concentrations of natural aflatoxins and supplemented when appropriate with aflatoxin B1 were distributed to participating laboratories for testing. The assay is based on competition between an enzyme-conjugated aflatoxin B1 and (free) aflatoxins in the test sample for aflatoxin-specific antibodies coated onto interior surfaces of microtiter wells.

A reliable analytical method for the quantitative determination of citreoviridin in corn and rice is described. Corn or rice is extracted with dichloromethane, and the extract is partially purified on silica and amino solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns. The extract is analyzed for citreoviridin by normal-phase liquid chromatography, using a mobile phase of ethyl acetate-hexane (75 + 25) at 1.5 mL/min and a fluorescence detector to measure the yellow fluorescence (388 nm excitation, 480 nm emission). With a 100 microL injection loop, the relationship between concentration and injection volume is linear for 20-60 microL injections. Recoveries of citreoviridin added to yellow corn at 10-50 ng/g were 91.0-96.9%; recoveries from white corn (10-50 ng/g added) were 96.8-102.8%. Recoveries of 5000 ng/g added to white corn were 89.0%, indicating that heavily contaminated samples can be assayed by the method. Minimum detection limits were 10 ng for citreoviridin standard and 2 ng/g for citreoviridin added to corn.

It was demonstrated that the average level of NIV was 757 +/- 707(54-2,760)ng/g, DON was 5,376 +/- 4,460 (360-12,670) ng/g with 100% positivity in corn samples consumed as staple food by esophageal cancer patients and their families. Corn samples collected from 5 villages in Linxian at different seasons in 1984-1986 all showed high levels of NIV and DON with 100% positivity which suggested that NIV and DON were consistently and widely existed in Linxian corn samples. Levels of 3-ADON and 15-ADON in Linxian corn were 113 +/- 57 and 495 +/- 538 ng/g. This paper also first demonstrates that the extracts of corn from esophageal cancer patients' families and their NIV and DON fractions purified by HPLC could induce significant chromosome aberrations in V79 cells, indicating that they had carcinogenic potential. Pure toxins of NIV, DON, T-2 and 3-ADON could induce chromosome aberrations in V79 cells starting from 1 ng/ml-a very low concentration. When concentrations increased to certain range they all showed toxic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],"['D002299', 'D004938', 'D006801', 'D009183', 'D012717', 'D013274', 'D014255', 'D003313', 'D015025']","['Cardia', 'Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Mycotoxins', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Stomach Neoplasms', 'Trichothecenes', 'Zea mays', 'Zearalenone']",[Trichothecenes in staple food from a high-incidence area of carcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia and their carcinogenic potential].,"[None, 'Q000139', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000139', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'chemically induced', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemically induced', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2970952,1988

3622512,"The origin and function of the large amount of 5-methylcytosine in plant DNA is not well understood. As a tool for in vitro studies of methylcytosine formation in plants we have isolated and characterized the DNA methyltransferase present in germinating wheat embryo. An enzyme fraction enriched 300-fold over the tissue homogenate was obtained by salt extraction of nuclei, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-75, blue Sepharose and on DNA immobilized on cellulose. It catalyzes the methylation of cytosine residues in double-stranded DNAs isolated from wheat, maize, calf thymus or bacteria using S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor. The efficient methylation of both an unmethylated plasmid DNA and its hemimethylated derivative indicate that the wheat DNA methylase can function de novo and in maintenance methylation. A relative molecular mass of 50,000-55,000 was estimated by gel permeation chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the presence of a protein of Mr = 50,000 and one other component (Mr = 35,000). The preference for endogenous, double-stranded DNA as substrate and the lower molecular mass distinguish wheat DNA methyltransferase from the DNA methylases obtained from mammalian sources.

Three preparations of a water soluble fraction (Frazer's fraction III, FIII) of partial peptic tryptic digests of wheat gluten had different effects in a direct (one stage) assay. Subfractions B and B2 caused migration inhibition of leucocytes from patients with treated coeliac disease but not of leucocytes from healthy volunteers or patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. This migration inhibition seems to be specific for gluten fractions because maize zein fraction B, beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin did not cause it. The sensitivity of coeliac leucocytes to fraction B is not related to factors present in coeliac serum as the migration of leucocytes from healthy individuals preincubated with coeliac sera was not inhibited. Puromycin diminished inhibition by fraction B, which was active at 1.2 micrograms/ml in an indirect (two stage) migration inhibition assay; this is consistent with a process involving elaboration of lymphokine(s). More highly purified fractions of B2, P1-P4 were prepared by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and showed differing potency in direct and indirect assays, with P4 being the most active fraction.

3520493,"Dimethylnitrosamine (NDMA), diethylnitrosamine (NDEA), methylbenzylnitrosamine, and a new N-nitroso compound, N-3-methylbutyl-N-1-methylacetonylnitrosamine (NMAMBA), were found in cornbread that was inoculated with Fusarium moniliforme and underwent an incubation and the addition of a small amount of NaNO2. The carcinogenicity of NMAMBA was shown by the induction of forestomach carcinomas and liver tumors in mice and rats. Another new nitrosamine, N-2-methylpropyl-N-methylacetonyl nitrosamine, was isolated in millet and wheat flour after similar treatment. Some species of fungi not only can reduce nitrates to nitrites but also can increase the amount of secondary amines in the moldy foods and provide favorable conditions for the synthesis of nitrosamines. Some fungi may utilize primary amines to synthesize nitrosamines in appropriate culture mediums. Furthermore, the cornmeal may naturally contain trace amounts of nitrosamines, as detected by a gas chromatography/thermoenergy analyzer. Prolonged feeding of F. moniliforme-inoculated cornbread alone also induced the development of forestomach carcinoma in rats. This indicates the occurrence of potential carcinogens, perhaps certain Fusarium mycotoxins, in the moldy cornbread in addition to the carcinogenic nitrosamines. Another nitroso compound, Roussin red methylester (di-mu-methanethiolatotetranitrosodiiron) was found in pickled vegetables that are eaten daily in the Linxian (China) area. Roussin Red may provide NO-2 ions, which would react readily with secondary amines to form nitrosamines. Possibly this compound is a natural tumor promoter and is able to induce epithelial hyperplasia of the upper digestive tract and forestomach papilloma in treated mice. Also, trace amounts of NDMA, NDEA, and some other nitrosamines were found in the extract of pickled vegetables.",Nutrition and cancer,"['D000818', 'D001939', 'D002273', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D005658', 'D006801', 'D008114', 'D009374', 'D009566', 'D009573', 'D009603', 'D003313']","['Animals', 'Bread', 'Carcinogens', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fungi', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrites', 'Nitroso Compounds', 'Zea mays']",Occurrence of nitroso compounds in fungi-contaminated foods: a review.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000139', 'Q000139', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemically induced', 'chemically induced', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3520493,1986

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a 300 A reversed-phase (RP)(C18) support (Syn Chropak RP-P), using acetonitrile as organic modifier in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, has been found to be capable of high-resolution separations of these proteins; the resolution is often better than that obtained by any other chromatographic or electrophoretic method. Examples are presented showing separations of low-molecular-weight gliadins, omega-gliadins and ethanol-soluble reduced glutenin subunits from wheat and of zein from corn. In addition, proteins may be directly extracted from ground single kernels and subsequently analyzed by RP-HPLC; applications in genetic studies, in breeding programs and in varietal identification are proposed. In addition to its high resolution, RP-HPLC is superior to most other methods in speed, sensitivity, reproducibility and suitability for quantitation. Polypeptide chains of molecular weight up to 133,000 are recovered in high yields and the column capacity is high, demonstrating that RP-HPLC is suitable for both preparative and analytical separations of proteins. RP-HPLC resolves proteins primarily on the basis of differences in surface hydrophobicity, so it therefore complements, rather than duplicates, other techniques that separate proteins on the basis of size or charge.

Four species, Fusarium culmorum, F tricinctum, F nivale and F moniliforme, were identified. Chloroform extracts of the raw materials and of an artificial medium in which three of the Fusarium species were cultured proved toxic to tissue cultures of a human epithelial cell line (HEp II). Specific identification by thin layer chromatography of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and diacetoxyscirpenol was achieved in some extracts. In addition, several other areas of the chromatograms were found to be toxic in the HEp II cell system and these may contain toxins for which standards were not available or, alternatively, previously uncharacterised fungal metabolites.

965326,"A method was developed for direct gas-liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GLC-MS) analysis of nonderivatized sterigmatocystin in wheat, rice, barley, and corn. Sterigmatocystin was extracted from spiked grain samples by 2 methods, both of which yielded high recoveries of 14C-labeled sterigmatocystin (greater than 90%). Extracts were cleaned up by gel permeation chromatography on polystyrene with tetrahydrofuran as the eluant. Chromatography of 14C-labeled compound indicated good recoveries (greater than 90%). The GLC-MS system was modified to give an all-glass chromatographic pathway to the ion source. Short glass or quartz columns packed with silicone liquid phase on inert supports gave the best results. Trace levels of sterigmatocystin were very labile in all gas chromatographic systems and levels below 5 ppb in grains were detected only with great difficulty. The GLC-MS system was utilized in the mass fragmentography mode, with selective ion monitoring of the m/e 295, 306, and 324 peaks. These ions were present in only trace levels in all control grain samples, indicating minimal interference from other compounds.

The blue fluorescent compounds were extracted with acetone and separated by paper chromatography. Anthranilic acid was present and the beta-glucoside was also identified by paper chromatography and beta-glucosdase and acid treatment. A third major fluorescent compound was not identified, but it was convertible to anthranilic acid by acid treatment. Anthranilate synthetase from mutant plants was 3-40 times more active and was also more resistant to feedback inhibition by tryptophan than was the enzyme from normal plants. The high activity and feedback resistance would both lead to anthranilate accumulation. Anthranilate-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (PR transferase), the enzyme which usually utilizes anthranilate in the tryptophan pathway, was inhibited by the beta-glucoside of anthranilic acid in a noncompetitive manner and showed very little activity in the mutant plant extract. This inhibition of the enzyme which utilizes anthranilate would also lead to accumulation. Apparently the oversynthesis of anthranilate leads to the formation of the beta-glucoside, which inhibits anthranilate utilization.
