35325205,"Nucleus-encoded circular RNAs (ncircRNAs) have been widely detected in eukaryotes, and most circRNA identification algorithms are designed to identify them. However, using these algorithms, few mitochondrion-encoded circRNAs (mcircRNAs) have been identified in plants, and the role of plant mcircRNAs has not yet been addressed. Here, we developed a circRNA identification algorithm, mitochondrion-encoded circRNA identifier (MeCi), based on common features of plant mitochondrial genomes. We identified 7,524, 9,819, 1,699, 1,821, 1,809, and 5,133 mcircRNAs in maize (Zea mays), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), and grape (Vitis vinifera), respectively. These mcircRNAs were experimentally validated. Plant mcircRNAs had distinct characteristics from ncircRNAs, and they were more likely to be derived from RNA degradation but not intron backsplicing. Alternative circularization was prevalent in plant mitochondria, and most parental genomic regions hosted multiple mcircRNA isoforms, which have homogenous 5' termini but heterogeneous 3' ends. By analysis of mitopolysome and mitoribosome profiling data, 1,463 mcircRNAs bound to ribosomes were detected in maize and Arabidopsis. Further analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data identified 358 mcircRNA-derived polypeptides. Overall, we developed a computational pipeline that efficiently identifies plant mcircRNAs, and we demonstrated mcircRNAs are widespread and translated in plants.",Plant physiology,[],[],Mitochondrion-encoded circular RNAs are widespread and translatable in plants.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35325205,2022
35286101,"Sea cucumber contains a wide range of bioactive compounds, including phenolics. This study investigated the free, esterified, and insoluble-bound phenolics of sea cucumber body wall as affected by high-pressure processing (HPP) pretreatment. Sea cucumber body wall was subjected to HPP (200, 400, and 600 MPa for 5, 10, and 15 min), followed by the extraction of phenolics. The contents of total phenolics and antioxidant activity were monitored. Compared to untreated samples, those treated with HPP exhibited significantly higher total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant activities. Treatment of 600 MPa for 10 min offered the optimal results. The highest amount of phenolics was observed in the free phenolic fraction, followed by esterified and insoluble-bound phenolic fractions. Moreover, phenolic extracts showed inhibitory effects against cupric ion-induced low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol oxidation, peroxyl and hydroxyl radical-induced DNA scission, α-glucosidase activity, and formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a quadrupole time of fight and mass spectrometer (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) identified 20 phenolic compounds, mainly phenolic acids and flavonoids, from the body wall of this species for the first time.

35200343,"In this study, a fluorometric and colorimetric dual-readout lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) using antibody functionalized polydopamine-coated gold nanoparticles (Au@PDAs) as a probe was developed for the detection of carbendazim (CBD). Colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were coated with polydopamines (PDA) by the oxidation of dopamine to synthesize Au@PDA nanoparticles. The Au@PDA nanoparticles mediated ZnCdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) fluorescence quenching and recovery, resulting in a reverse fluorescence enhancement detection format of CBD. The CBD detection was obtained by the competition between the CBD and the immobilized antigen for Au@PDAs labelled antibody binding, resulting in a significant fluorescence increase and colorimetry decrease corresponded to the concentration of CBD. Dual readout modes were incorporated into the LFIA using the colorimetry signal under natural light and the fluorescence signal under UV light. The cut-off value in the mode of the colorimetric signal and fluorometric signal for CBD detection was 0.5 μg/mL and 0.0156 μg/mL, respectively. The sensitivity of LFIA of the fluorescence mode was 32 times higher than that of the colorimetry mode. There was negligible cross reactivity obtained by using LFIA for the determination of thiabendazole, benomyl, thiophanate-methyl, and thiophanate-ethyl.

The levels of TMs were measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The mean levels of Ni, Cu, Cd, Cr, As and Zn in all crops were below maximum permissible concentrations (MPCs), while those of Pb in pepper (0.109 mg/kg fw), eggplant (0.103 mg/kg fw) and green bean (0.177 mg/kg fw) slightly exceeded MPCs (0.1 mg/kg fw).

Further, the chlorpyrifos diffusion behaviour was compared with the osmotic potential, shear strength, cuticular chemical profile and microstructure of peel surface of vegetables. The persistence analysis results revealed that chlorpyrifos level was decreased in peel surface and diffusion rate was increased in inner tissue with respect to durations. Within 72 h exposure, chlorpyrifos reached 0.7 cm depth into the inner tissue of vegetables. Significant level of chlorpyrifos diffusion with P ≤ 0.05 was observed in beetroot (2.47%), khon khol (1.46%) and brinjal (0.92%) compared to cucumber and potato.

Therefore, some studies regarding the artificial breeding and cultivation of H. leucospilota have been undertaken recently. However, the biological functions of the digestive system of this species have not been elucidated. In this study, a cDNA coding for α-amylase, an indicator of digestive maturity in animals, was identified from H. leucospilota and designated Hl-Amy. The full-length cDNA of the Hl-Amy gene, which is 1734 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1578 bp, encodes a 525 amino acid (a.a.) protein with a deduced molecular weight of 59.34 kDa. According to the CaZy database annotation, Hl-Amy belongs to the class of GH-H with the official nomenclature of α-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) or 4-α-D-glucan glucanohydrolase. The Hl-Amy protein contains a signal peptide at the N-terminal followed by a functional amylase domain, which includes the catalytic activity site. The mRNA expression of Hl-Amy was abundantly exhibited in the intestine, followed by the transverse vessel with a low level, but was hardly detected in other selected tissues. During embryonic and larval development, Hl-Amy was constitutively expressed in all stages, and the highest expression level was observed in the blastula. By in situ hybridization (ISH), positive Hl-Amy signals were observed in different parts of the three different intestinal segments (foregut, midgut and hindgut). The Hl-Amy recombinant protein was generated in an E. coli system with codon optimization, which is necessary for Hl-Amy successfully expressed in this heterogenous system. The Hl-Amy recombinant protein was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), and its activity of starch hydrolysis was further detected. The optimal temperatures and pH for Hl-Amy recombinant protein were 55°C and 6.0, respectively, with an activity of 62.2 U/mg.

Three species of sea cucumbers, Cucumaria frondosa, Apostichopus californicus and Apostichopusjaponicus were collected from three geographical regions, Atlantic and Pacific coast of Canada and Yellow sea/ East China sea in China, respectively. These organisms were sectioned into parts (body wall, tentacles, internal organ, skin and muscle) and analysed for total arsenic (As) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and As species by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to ICP-MS. Normal and reversed sequential extractions were optimised to address As distribution between lipids (polar and non-polar) and water-extractable fractions. Two extraction methods for water-extractable As were compared in terms of the number and the amount of extracted species.

The determination of herbicides is important in environmental protection, agricultural production, food safety, and public health. In this study, a facile and efficient analytical method was proposed for the trace detection of phenoxy herbicides in soil, cucumber, and tap water samples by coupling pipette tip solid phase extraction (PT-SPE) with high performance liquid chromatography. UiO-66-funtionalized cotton (Cotton@UiO-66) was packed into pipette-tip as sorbent to fabricate extraction device. The modification of UiO-66 on cotton fiber was confirmed using scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The main factors affecting the adsorption of Cotton@UiO-66 for four phenoxy herbicides were evaluated by response surface methodology in detail. Under optimized conditions, Cotton@UiO-66 displayed excellent properties in the extraction of phenoxy herbicides with good peak shape. Linear ranges of 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, dicamba, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid were 1.4-72 μg/L, 5.6-280 μg/L, 2.8-140 μg/L and 3.2-160 μg/L (RSDs < 6.3%), respectively.

In this study, the insecticidal activity of 17 plant essential oils was evaluated via topical application against two strains of Ae. aegypti mosquito, Orlando (insecticide-susceptible) and Puerto Rico (pyrethroid-resistant). Initial screens with the Orlando strain showed that cucumber seed oil (2017 sample) was the most toxic, followed by sandalwood and thyme oil. When the essential oils were mixed with permethrin, they failed to show any significant synergism of insecticidal activity. Sandalwood and thyme oils displayed consistently high mortality against the resistant Puerto Rico strain, with low resistance ratios of 2.1 and 1.4, respectively. In contrast, cucumber seed oil showed significantly less activity against Puerto Rico mosquitoes, with a resistance ratio of 45. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the 2017 sample of cucumber seed oil sample via flash column chromatography produced 11 fractions, and gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the three active fractions were contaminated with 0.33, 0.36, and 0.33% of chlorpyrifos-methyl, an organophosphorus insecticide, whereas inactive fractions did not show any trace of it.

However, the different enantioselective behaviors and biological activities of chiral pesticide enantiomers are often ignored. In this work, a novel method was put forward to investigate the enantioselective effects and potential risks of two paclobutrazol enantiomers during cucumber pickling process. The degradation kinetics indicated that when paclobutrazol reside in cucumber and was introduced into the pickling process, the half-time of paclobutrazol isomers were significantly different (9.24 d and 16.6 d), and the conversion phenomenon between the two enantiomers could also be observed. In addition, results from 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing shown that (2R, 3R)-paclobutrazol and (2S, 3S)-paclobutrazol have an obviously enantiomeric effects on microbial community of pickling system and the degradation of paclobutrazol was probably attributed to the presence of Pseudomonas and Serratia. Finally, the microorganisms functions were found to be disrupted under the exposure of (2R, 3R)-paclobutrazol and metabolic function of microorganisms to xenobiotic was inhibited, which might cause potential risks to the quality of preserved foods.

31600335,"Grafting has been widely applied to melon (Cucumis melo L.) production to alleviate obstacles of continuous cropping and control soil-borne diseases. However, grafting often leads to a decline of fruit quality. For example, sometimes bitter fruits are produced on grafted plants. However, the underlying physiological mechanism still remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of different rootstocks on the taste of fruits of the Balengcui, an oriental melon cultivar, during summer production. The results showed that all grafted plants with Cucurbita maxima Duch. rootstocks produced bitter fruits, while non-grafted plants and plants grafted onto muskmelon rootstocks produced no bitter fruits. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and metabonomic analysis were performed to investigate the mechanism underlying the occurrence of bitter fruits. Metabolite comparisons of fruits from plants grafted onto Ribenxuesong rootstocks both with non-grafted plants and plants grafted onto muskmelon rootstocks showed that 17 metabolites including phospholipids, cucurbitacins and flavonoids, exhibited changes. The three Cucurbitacins, Cucurbitacin O, Cucurbitacin C, and Cucurbitacin S, increased dramatically.

These metabolites were involved in the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway, the mevalonate pathway, and the phenylpropanoid pathway. In summary, these results showed that the bitter fruits of grafted Balengcui were caused by Cucurbita maxima Duch. rootstocks.

The cultivated soil (i.e., a volcanic cohesive soil) had a high total organic carbon (TOC = 3.4%) and therefore showed strong adsorption of long-chain PFASs. Short-chain PFCAs (i.e., under C9) were mainly detected in vegetables; specifically, PFBA showed high concentration in tomato shoots. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots clearly showed that PFASs in vegetables were different from those of cultivated soil, air, and rainwater. Interestingly, the whole potato (i.e., including peel) was in the same group as soil, indicating that the whole potato can easily be affected by the cultivated soil.

However, little is known in this context with regard to food safety aspects arising from toxigenic fungi. In this study, samples of feed (n = 7) and water (n = 8) or water filters (n = 4) from experimental aquaculture systems, producing sea urchin and sea cucumber, were analyzed by culture-based microbiological methods to assess fungal associations. Additionally, a search using molecular techniques for toxigenic sections within the genus Aspergillus in these materials was done. Finally, samples were analyzed for 37 mycotoxins by LC-MS/MS. In feed samples, Fusarium verticillioides and F. culmorum were detected. In water and water filter samples, Aureobasidium spp., Penicillium spp., and Cladosporium spp. were found. No genes of species from toxigenic Aspergillus sections were detected. Some feed samples were contaminated by multiple mycotoxins, namely deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEN), fumonisins (FBs), T-2 toxin, ochratoxin A (OTA), and mycophenolic acid (MPA). This is the first one study dealing with toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in echinoderm-producting aquaculture. Although no clear evidence for adverse effects on the production systems could be found, the confirmed environmental association of mycotoxins and echinoderms requires further consideration.

The antioxidant activity of SCPPs declined and structure exhibited abnormalities during the storage. After 24 h of storage, kinds of aldehydes decreased and the content of alcohols increased obviously. After 80 days, (Z)-3,5-dimethyl-2-(1-propenyl)-pyrazine and 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid-bis(2-methylpropyl) ester were identified as the characteristic off-flavor.

29984381,"Matrix effects (MEs) can adversely affect quantification in pesticide residue analysis using GC. Analyte protectants (APs) can effectively interact with and mask active sites in the GC system, and are added individually or in combination to sample extracts and calibration solutions to minimize errors related to MEs. Unfortunately, APs cannot sufficiently compensate for MEs in all cases. Plant extracts, containing a broad range of natural compounds with AP properties, can also be used for this purpose. In this study, the applicability of cucumber extract as a natural AP mixture was investigated both alone and in combination with traditional APs. Extracts of two selected difficult matrices (onion and garlic) were prepared according to the citrate-buffered QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) procedure. ME values of 40 representative GC-amenable pesticides were compared when calibrating against standards in pure solvent and in cucumber extract, with and without the addition of APs. Using a GC system with a contaminated inlet liner, the use of a cucumber-based calibration solution decreased MEs remarkably. The combination of APs with cucumber raw extract further decreased MEs, resulting in more than 85% of the tested pesticides showing ≤ 10% ME in onion and ≤ 20% ME in garlic. These results demonstrate that the preparation of calibration standards based on cucumber extracts (with or without the addition of APs) is a very useful and practical approach to compensate for MEs in pesticide residue analysis using QuEChERS and GC-MS/MS.

The wild-type strain (CMV-R) induces green mosaic symptoms and malformation while the mutant strain (CMV-R3E79R) causes chlorotic lesions on inoculated leaves and strong stunting with necrosis on systemic leaves. Virion preparations of CMV-R and CMV-R3E79R were partially purified from Nicotiana clevelandii A. Gray and analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Their separated protein patterns showed remarkable differences at the 50-75 kDa range, both in numbers and intensity of spots, with more protein spots for the mutant CMV. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the virion preparations contained host proteins identified as ATP synthase alpha and beta subunits as well as small and large Rubisco subunits, respectively. Virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA), immunogold electron microscopy and modified ELISA experiments were used to prove the direct interaction between the virus particle and the N. clevelandii ATP synthase F1 motor complex. Protein-protein docking study revealed that the electrostatic change in the mutant CMV can introduce stronger interactions with ATP synthase F1 complex. Based on our findings we suggest that the mutation present in the CP can have a direct effect on the long-distance movement and systemic symptoms. In molecular view the mutant CMV virion can lethally block the rotation of the ATP synthase F1 motor complex which may lead to cell apoptosis, and finally to plant death.",Virus research,"['D036022', 'D017799', 'D015180', 'D004797', 'D054884', 'D007150', 'D013058', 'D016253', 'D062105', 'D008970', 'D017354', 'D011485', 'D006180', 'D012273', 'D014026']","['Capsid Proteins', 'Cucumovirus', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase', 'Tobacco']",A single point mutation on the cucumber mosaic virus surface induces an unexpected and strong interaction with the F1 complex of the ATP synthase in Nicotiana clevelandii plants.,"['Q000737', 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000821']","['chemistry', 'genetics', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'virology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29730309,2018

A modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method was applied to determine 26 pesticides (organophosphates, organochlorines, synthetic pyrethroids, and herbicides) in different complex matrices, including cauliflower, cucumber, banana, apple, wheat, and black gram. Different physicochemical characterization techniques were used to investigate the engineering and structural properties of the r-DSPE sorbent. All the chromatographic analyses were performed with a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector. The recoveries of all 26 pesticides were acceptable (70-120%), with relative standard deviations of less than 15%. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 1.13-5.48 ng/g and 3.42-16.60 ng/g, respectively. In the original QuEChERS method, primary secondary amine is extensively used as the r-DSPE sorbent in the cleanup process, but it is eightfold more expensive than the ACFs used in this study. Therefore, the modified QuEChERS method using ACFs during the cleanup process is more efficient, cheaper, and more robust to determine pesticides from different types of matrices, including vegetables, grains, and fruits, and ACFs could be used as a cost-effective alternative to primary secondary amine.

Matrix effects (MEs) were studied by comparing the slopes of calibration curves of the matrix-matched standards (diluted with mobile phase) vis-à-vis the solvent-based standards. The present study showed that MEs were dependent on the nature of both the commodity and the analyte. Among the test matrixes, the highest variability in ME was recorded in capsicum. Most of the pesticides showed signal suppression in tomato, capsicum, and cumin matrixes. In brinjal matrix, the signal of most of the pesticides showed slight enhancement. Due to the similar nature of the MEs in tomato and capsicum, these two commodities can be grouped together. Considering analyte variability, acetamiprid, 3-hydroxy carbofuran, dichlorvos, dimethoate, and spinosyn A and D showed no significant ME (≤20%) in tomato. Very high MEs (2360.9 and 1250.8%) were observed for quizalofop-p-tefuryl and tebuconazole, respectively. To check the effect of dilution in minimizing the ME, cucumber and brinjal matrixes were diluted 10×, and calibration curves were drawn with five concentration levels.

The use of spiked calibration standards for constructing the calibration curve substantially reduced adverse matrix-related effects. The recovery of pesticides at 5 concentration levels (n = 3) was in the range of 80.6-112.3. The method was proved to be repeatable with RSD lower than 20%. The limits of detection and quantification for all pesticides were <10 ng/g and <25 ng/g, respectively. The developed method was used for simultaneous determination of the selected pesticides in 60 greenhouse and garden cucumber samples. Among the 60 analyzed samples, 41.7% of them were contaminated with pesticide residues which 31.7% of samples had pesticide residues lower than maximum residue limit and 10% of samples had residue higher than maximum residue limit.",Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,[],[],A Multi Residue GC-MS Method for Determination of 12 Pesticides in Cucumber.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28243277,2020

The identity of the compound in standard solution and representative field incurred samples was confirmed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was validated in terms of linearity, limits of detection and quantification, accuracy (expressed as recovery) and precision (expressed as relative standard deviation) for accurate and precise quantitation. Notably, the residual levels of field incurred samples collected over days 0-10 post-application were below the maximum residue level (0.2 mg/kg) established by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. Site A showed lower residue levels and a higher decline rate than site B, which might be attributed to seasonal variation (high temperature) and increased metabolic and enzyme profiling in the mature fruits. The half-lives were similar, 4.9 and 4.3 days, at sites A and B, respectively.

A laboratory test was carried out by treating the matrices with standard solution for different periods of time. The percentage sorption of pesticides ranged from 0.02 to 89.3% for the three matrices. The pesticides' distribution was also determined, and all pesticides showed ratio values (Q) between pulp and peel concentrations in the three matrices of <0.8, which proved that the highest pesticides' content was found in the peel. In addition, a rapid and simple process combining a surface swab capture method and pulse glow discharge-ion mobility spectrometry (PGD-IMS) detection was established for the detection of pesticides on matrix surfaces. In the swab method, the whole matrix surface was swabbed manually by swab sticks, and swab sticks were agitated in acetonitrile to release the pesticides.

27472661,"Cucurbits are well-studied models for phloem biology but unusually possess both fascicular phloem (FP) within vascular bundles and additional extrafascicular phloem (EFP). Although the functional differences between the two systems are not yet clear, sugar analysis and limited protein profiling have established that FP and EFP have divergent compositions. Here we report a detailed comparative proteomics study of FP and EFP in two cucurbits, pumpkin and cucumber. We re-examined the sites of exudation by video microscopy, and confirmed that in both species, the spontaneous exudate following tissue cutting derives almost exclusively from EFP. Comparative gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry-based proteomics of exudates, sieve element contents and microdissected stem tissues established that EFP and FP profiles are highly dissimilar, and that there are also species differences. Searches against cucurbit databases enabled identification of more than 300 FP proteins from each species. Few of the detected proteins (about 10%) were shared between the sieve element contents of FP and EFP, and enriched Gene Ontology categories also differed. To explore quantitative differences in the proteomes, we developed multiple reaction monitoring methods for cucumber proteins that are representative markers for FP or EFP and assessed exudate composition at different times after tissue cutting. Based on failure to detect FP markers in exudate samples, we conclude that FP is blocked very rapidly and therefore makes a minimal contribution to the exudates. Overall, the highly divergent contents of FP and EFP indicate that they are substantially independent vascular compartments.",The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,"['D018553', 'D028464', 'D052585', 'D010940', 'D040901']","['Cucumis sativus', 'Cucurbita', 'Phloem', 'Plant Proteins', 'Proteomics']",Comparative proteomics of cucurbit phloem indicates both unique and shared sets of proteins.,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000379']","['metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27472661,2017

27443204,"Most countries have clearly defined regulations governing the use of pesticides in agricultural activity. The application of pesticides in agriculture usually leads to a residual amount of these pesticides on food products such as fruit and vegetables. The presence of pesticide residues on these foods destined for human consumption may pose food safety risks to consumers. To protect consumers, national authorities have established maximum limits for pesticide residues in foods. These limits can only be enforced if there are methods available to detect and monitor their concentrations in the applicable food products. To support the enforcement of this legislation, we have developed a multi-residue liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the analysis of 120 pesticide residues in apples and cucumbers which has been validated and implemented in the routine monitoring and surveillance programme for these pesticides. In this method, apple and cucumber samples are extracted using the QuEChERS method (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) and the extracts were analyzed directly by LC-MS/MS. The mean recoveries at three different concentrations of 0.01 µg/g , 0.05 µg/g, and 0.1 µg/g over the analytical range varied between 70 and 120%.

In the present study, the role of Se in inducing tolerance to Cd stress in cucumber was elucidated. Results showed that Se significantly alleviated Cd-induced growth inhibition, reduced Cd concentration, increased SPAD value and improved photosynthetic performance. Through proteomic analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with mass spectrometry, 26 protein spots were identified, which were significantly influenced by Cd stress and/or Se application. Among these proteins, the abundance of 21 spots (10 in leaves and 11 in roots) were repressed in Cd-treated and up-accumulated or no-changed in Cd+Se-treated cucumber. These altered proteins were involved in the response to stress, metabolism, photosynthesis and storage, they were including glutathione S-transferase F8, heat shock protein STI-like, peroxidase, ascorbate oxidase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 2, NiR, Rieske type ion sulfur subunit and PsbP domain-containing protein 6. Furthermore, we identified five proteins with an increase in relative abundance after Cd treatment, they were involved in the functional groups active in response to stress and transport.

27378220,"A simple method based on dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction method based on solidification of floating organic droplets (DLLME-SFO) was developed for the extraction of chlorpyrifos (CP), chlorpyrifos-methyl (CPM), and their main degradation product 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) in tomato and cucumber samples. The determination was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). In the DSPE-DLLME-SFO, the analytes were first extracted with acetone. The clean-up of the extract by DSPE was carried out by directly adding activated carbon sorbent into the extract solution, followed by shaking and filtration. Under the optimum conditions, the proposed method was sensitive and showed a good linearity within a range of 2-500 ng/g, with the correlation coefficients (r) varying from 0.9991 to 0.9996. The enrichment factors ranged from 127 to 138. The limit of detections (LODs) were in the range of 0.12-0.68 ng/g, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) for 50 ng/g of each analytes in tomato samples were in the range of 3.25-6.26 % (n = 5).

27168328,"Benzene kresoxim-methyl (BKM) is a new strobilurin fungicide mixed with fluazinam (Flu) into 40 % suspension concentrate (SC) formulation to improve fungicidal efficacy and to reduce the risk of resistance on cucumber. However, the fate of the fungicide residues in a cucumber plantation remains unclear. Thus, an efficient method of ultra-performance liquid chromatography combined with a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe sample preparation was developed to simultaneously determine the BKM and Flu residues in cucumber and soil samples to investigate their residual behavior and risk assessment in the cucumber plantation. This analytical method revealed that the detection limits of BKM and Flu were 1.64 × 10(-3) and 1.82 × 10(-3) mg L(-1), respectively, and their average recoveries in the cucumber and soil samples were 77.5-106.9 %. The respective half-lives of BKM and Flu were 2.2-3.4 and 1.0-2.5 days in cucumber; in soil, the half-lives of BKM and Flu were 2.6-5.0 and 2.4-5.3 days, respectively. Seven days after application, the terminal residues of BKM and Flu in cucumber were less than 0.02 mg kg(-1). The residual profiles of BKM and Flu suggested that these fungicides could rapidly degrade in cucumber plantations. Their hazard quotient values were all less than 1 on the preharvest intervals of 3, 5, and 7 days, indicating that the dietary risk of BKM and Flu 40 % SC with the recommended usage on cucumber is negligible.

Thus, understanding their uptake, transportation, and transformation in plants, especially food crops, is critical because it represents a potential pathway for human consumption. One of the primary challenges for the endeavor is the inadequacy of current analytical methodologies to characterize and quantify the nanomaterial in complex biological samples at environmentally relevant concentrations. Herein, a method was developed using single particle-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS) technology to simultaneously detect the size and size distribution of particulate Ce, particle concentration, and dissolved cerium in the shoots of four plant species including cucumber, tomato, soybean, and pumpkin. An enzymatic digestion method with Macerozyme R-10 enzyme previously used for gold nanoparticle extraction from the tomato plant was adapted successfully for CeO2NP extraction from all four plant species. This study is the first to report and demonstrate the presence of dissolved cerium in plant seedling shoots exposed to CeO2NPs hydroponically.

Cucumber seedlings were used as the scions and two pumpkin cultivars with strongly contrasting grafting compatibilities were used as the rootstocks. Non-grafted and self-grafted cucumber seedlings served as control groups. An average of approximately 500 detectable spots were observed on each 2-DE gel. A total of 50 proteins were differentially expressed in response to self-grafting, compatible-rootstock grafting, and incompatible-rootstock grafting and were all successfully identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. The regulation of Calvin cycle, photosynthetic apparatus, glycolytic pathway, energy metabolism, protein biosynthesis and degradation, and reactive oxygen metabolism will probably contribute to intensify the biomass and photosynthetic capacity in graft-compatible combinations. The improved physiological and growth characteristics of compatible-rootstock grafting plants are the result of the higher expressions of proteins involved in photosynthesis, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, and protein metabolism.

To bridge the knowledge gap, the current study was initiated to investigate the stereoselective degradation of sulfoxaflor in solar greenhouse cucumber and tomato from foliage and root uptake pathways. The stereoselective dissipation of sulfoxaflor was not statistically different between enantiomer pairs from foliage and root pathways of vegetables (P < 0.05).

Nevertheless, the concentrations of (+)-sulfoxaflor A and (-)-sulfoxaflor B were both slightly higher than that of their antipode.

For both spiking levels, 80-82% of the pesticides in the non-cleaned extracts and 80-84% of the pesticides in the cleaned extracts were within the acceptable recovery range of 70-120%. Precision data for both levels showed that 95% of the pesticides in the non-cleaned extracts and 93-95% of the pesticides in the cleaned extracts had RSDs below 20%. Recovery and precision data were determined using a two tailed t-test (p = 0.05). By using calibration standards in the respective matrix, we studied if the non-cleaned calibration standards gave an extra matrix effect compared with the cleaned standards by using the slope from calibration graphs and plotting the calculated extra matrix effect minus 100 for each compound. The results showed that for 79% of the pesticides, the extra matrix effect minus 100 was within the acceptable range of -20% to 20%.

The fungicides were determined by gas chromatography (GC) and confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Extraction and purification of the samples were carried out by Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) method after validating the analytical parameters. Initial residues of trifloxystrobin on gherkin fruits were 0.335 and 0.65 mg kg(-1) at Bangalore, and 0.34 and 0.615 mg kg(-1) at Gouribiddunur. Tebuconazole residues were 0.842 and 1.682 mg kg(-1) at Bangalore, and 0.71 and 1.34 mg kg(-1) at Gouribiddunur. Residue dissipation of the fungicides followed first-order rate kinetics. Trifloxystrobin residues dissipated at the half-life of 2.9-3.7 days, and tebuconazole at 3.2 days. At the standard dose treatment, trifloxystrobin residues dissipated to below the maximum residue limit (MRL) of 0.2 mg kg(-1) (European Union) within 3 days at both the locations.

However, we have limited knowledge of other chemical components in fermented cucumber that may be related to spoilage and the unique metabolic capabilities of L. buchneri. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry metabolite profiling methods were applied for nontargeted detection of volatile and nonvolatile compounds to determine changes that occurred during anaerobic fermented cucumber spoilage by L. buchneri LA1147 and during reproduction of spoilage with natural microbiota. Univariate analysis of variance combined with hierarchial clustering analysis revealed 92 metabolites that changed during spoilage (P<0.01). Decreases were observed in mono and disaccharides, amino acids, nucleosides, long chain fatty acids, aldehydes, and ketones, and increases were observed in several alcohols and butanoic and pentanoic acids. Most of the metabolite changes preceded lactic acid utilization, indicating that lactic acid is not a preferred substrate for anaerobic spoilage organisms in fermented cucumbers. The ability to detect biochemical changes that preceded lactate utilization revealed citrulline, trehalose, and cellobiose as compounds that may signify metabolic activity of L. buchneri spoilage strains prior to any significant product degradation.

26124451,"Several carapid fishes, known as pearlfishes, are endosymbiotic in holothuroids and asteroids. These echinoderms contain a strong concentration of saponins that are efficient membranolytic repellents to predators. We compared the effects of exposure to saponins from the sea cucumber body wall and from the Cuvierian tubules on the behavior and gill ultrastructure of pearlfishes and free-living fishes. Saponins were extracted from the body wall of two holothuroids, the Mediterranean Holothuria forskali and the tropical Bohadschia atra, and from the water surrounding the Cuvierian tubules of B. atra. Five species of carapids that live in symbiosis with holothuroids and seven species of free-living fishes were exposed to these extracts. The free-living fishes exhibited a stress response and died about 45 times faster than pearlfishes when exposed to the same quantity of saponins. Cuvierian tubules and saponins extracted from the body wall were lethal to the free-living fishes, whereas the carapids were much less sensitive. The carapids did not exhibit a stress response. The high toxicity shown by Cuvierian tubules was not explained by the nature of the saponins that were identified by mass spectrometry, but it is likely due to the higher concentration of saponins in the tubules. Histology and scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the gills of the free-living fishes and pearlfishes showed that saponins act at the level of the secondary lamellae where they induce the detachment of the epithelia, create edema at the level of the epithelia, and induce pores in the epithelial cells that lead to their destruction and the invasion of inner cells (pillar cells and red blood cells).

This study investigated the phytotoxicity of different metals frequently found as pollutants in soils: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel and zinc. Cucumber (Cucumis sativus), sorghum (Sorghum saccharatum) and cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds were used as models for other plants used in human nutrition such as cereals, rice, fruits and vegetables. The 72-h germination rate and root elongations were selected as short-term ecotoxicological endpoints in seeds exposed to single metals and mixtures. Metals were spiked onto OECD standard soils in concentrations comparable to current Italian contamination threshold concentrations for residential and commercial soils. Arsenic, chromium, mercury and nickel were the most toxic metals in our experimental conditions, particularly to cress seeds (5.172, 152 and 255.4 mg/kg as 72 h IC50 for arsenic, mercury and nickel respectively). Italian limits were acceptable for plant protection only for exposure to each metal alone but not for the mixtures containing all the metals concentrations expected by their respective legislative threshold. The effects of the mixture were class-specific: trends were comparable in dicots but different in monocots. The response induced by the mixture at high concentrations differed from that theoretically obtainable by summing the effects of the individual metals. This might be due to partial antagonism of the metals in soil or to the formation of complexes between the metals, which reduce the bioavailability of the pollutants for plants.",Environmental research,"['D007558', 'D008670', 'D010944', 'D012989', 'D013054']","['Italy', 'Metals', 'Plants', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",Acute phytotoxicity of seven metals alone and in mixture: Are Italian soil threshold concentrations suitable for plant protection?,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25841179,2015

Cucumber was spiked at 0.075 mg/kg with each of the 15 selected pesticides (acetamiprid, azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, diazinon, (α + β)-endosulfan, fenitrothion, imazalil, imidacloprid, iprodione, malathion, methomyl, tebuconazole and thiabendazole) respectively. Three different strategies were considered for processing the material, based on the physicochemical properties of the vegetable and the target pesticides. As a result, a frozen spiked slurry of fresh cucumber, a spiked freeze-dried cucumber powder and a freeze-dried cucumber powder spiked by spraying the powder were studied. The effects of processing and aspects related to the reconstitution of the material were evaluated by monitoring the pesticide levels in the three materials. Two separate analytical methods based on LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS were developed and validated in-house. The spiked freeze-dried cucumber powder was selected as the most feasible material and more exhaustive studies on homogeneity and stability of the pesticide residues in the matrix were carried out. The results suggested that the between-unit homogeneity was satisfactory with a sample intake of dried material as low as 0.1 g. A 9-week isochronous stability study was undertaken at -20 °C, 4 °C and 18 °C, with -70 °C designated as the reference temperature. The pesticides tested exhibited adequate stability at -20 °C during the 9-week period as well as at -70 °C for a period of 18 months.

The sample preparation and SFE parameters were optimized for extracting LC-amenable polar and medium-polarity pesticides. High recoveries were achieved for most of the tested pesticides by extracting a 1 : 1 : 1 sample-Celite-anhydrous magnesium sulfate mixture with supercritical carbon dioxide at 16.4 MPa at 40℃ for 30 min with methanol added as a modifier. The recoveries of 117 pesticides fortified with 0.01 mg/kg of each pesticide were 70-120%, and the relative standard deviations were less than 25% for 112 pesticides in tomato and 103 pesticides in cucumber.

Their inhibitory activities were examined by amending the chemical in agar media, on which selected plant pathogens were grown and mycelial growth were measured. Effective concentrations for 50% inhibition (EC50) of mycelial growth were calculated to determine the level of fungicide sensitivity of the pathogen. Azoxystrobin was used as control. To examine the prevention and systemic translocation in plants, the fungicides were either sprayed on wheat leaves or dipped on wheat roots, which then were detected using high performance liquid chromatography. All the three fungicides inhibited mycelial growth of Sphacelotheca reiliana, Phytophthora infestans, Peronophythora litchi, and Magnaporthe oryzae, with EC50 values ranging from 0.02 to 2.84μg/ml; EC50 of SYP1620 was significantly lower than that of azoxystrobin and enestroburin on Valsa mali, Gaeumannomyces graminis, Alternaria solani, and Colletotrichun orbiculare. The three QoI fungicides showed strong inhibitory activities on spore germination against the 13 pathogens tested and were highly effective on biotrophic pathogens tested. Enestroburin and SYP1620 penetrated and spread in wheat leaves, but the penetration and translocation levels were lower compared to azoxystrobin. The three fungicides were all rapidly taken up by wheat roots and transported upwards, with greater fungicide concentrations in roots than in stems and leaves. The results indicate that enestroburin and SYP1620 are systemic fungicides that inhibit a broad spectrum of fungi and oomycetes.

With the aim of developing rapid analytical screening methods for this relevant compound, we herein report the synthesis of new boscalid mimics and the study of their suitability for the production of polyclonal antibodies. Aliphatic spacer arms equivalent in length and composition were tethered at two different aromatic rings of the target molecular structure. These haptens, besides being used for immunization, were employed in the development of heterologous competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (cELISAs) in order to improve assay detectability. Direct and indirect immunoassays were tailored and applied to the determination of samples with incurred boscalid residues. The assays were characterized in terms of sensitivity, specificity, trueness, and precision. Limit of quantification was established at 5 μg kg(-1), coefficients of variation were lower than 20%, and recoveries from spiked samples ranged from 90 to 137%. Finally, ELISA performance was evaluated by Deming regression analysis with tomato and cucumber samples, selecting ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as the reference method.

24418711,"A reproducible method for monitoring traces of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors in acetonitrile extracts from fruits and vegetables is described. The method is based on hypochlorite oxidation and ChE inhibition assay. Four common representative samples of produce were selected from a supermarket to investigate the effect of different matrices on pesticides recoveries and assay precision. The samples were extracted with acetonitrile to prepare them for ChE inhibition assays: if necessary, clean-up was performed using dispersive solid-phase extraction for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses. Chlorine was tested as an oxidising reagent for the conversion of thiophosphorus pesticides (P=S compounds) into their P=O analogues, which have high ChE-inhibiting activity. Chlorine consumption of individual acetonitrile extracts was determined and was strongly dependent on the individual types of fruits and vegetables. After treating the acetonitrile extracts with an excess hypochlorite at 25°C for 15 min, the ChE-inhibiting activities and detection limits for each chlorine-treated pesticide solution were determined. Matrix composition did not interfere significantly with the determination of the pesticides.

Qualitative descriptive analysis (QDA) was used to assess the organoleptic impact of the different melons and the sensory data were correlated with the chemical analysis. There were significant, consistent and substantial differences between the mature and immature fruit for the medium shelf-life genotype, the less mature giving a green, cucumber character and lacking the sweet, fruity character of the mature fruit. However, maturity at harvest had a much smaller impact on the long shelf-life melons and fewer differences were detected.

In this study, S. japonicus, collected from the sea near Jeju Island of Korea, was lyophilised or vacuum-dried and then analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The GC-MS profiles of vacuum-dried and lyophilised samples differed. Based on direct injection and static headspace analysis, 37 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified in vacuum-dried samples and 33 VOCs were identified in lyophilised samples. Therefore, the odour of vacuum-dried sea cucumber is thought to be due to the presence of various VOCs that are absent in lyophilised sea cucumber. According to ICP-MS analysis, the levels of 15 inorganic elements were slightly higher in lyophilised samples than in vacuum-dried samples.

In this research, cucumber plants were cultivated for 150 days in sandy loam soil treated with 0 to 750 mg TiO2 NPs kg(-1). Fruits were analyzed using synchrotron μ-XRF and μ-XANES, ICP-OES, and biochemical assays. Results showed that catalase in leaves increased (U mg(-1) protein) from 58.8 in control to 78.8 in 750 mg kg(-1) treatment; while ascorbate peroxidase decreased from 21.9 to 14.1 in 500 mg kg(-1) treatment. Moreover, total chlorophyll content in leaves increased in the 750 mg kg(-1) treatment. Compared to control, FTIR spectra of fruit from TiO2 NP treated plants showed significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in band areas of amide, lignin, and carbohydrates, suggesting macromolecule modification of cucumber fruit. In addition, compared with control, plants treated with 500 mg kg(-1) had 35% more potassium and 34% more phosphorus. For the first time, μ-XRF and μ-XANES showed root-to-fruit translocation of TiO2 in cucumber without biotransformation.

23973661,"In order to broaden the available genetic variation of melon, we developed an ethyl methanesulfonate mutation library in an orange-flesh 'Charentais' type melon line that accumulates β-carotene. One mutagenized M2 family segregated for a novel recessive trait, a yellow-orange fruit flesh ('yofI'). HPLC analysis revealed that 'yofI' accumulates pro-lycopene (tetra-cis-lycopene) as its major fruit pigment. The altered carotenoid composition of 'yofI' is associated with a significant change of the fruit aroma since cleavage of β-carotene yields different apocarotenoids than the cleavage of pro-lycopene. Normally, pro-lycopene is further isomerized by CRTISO (carotenoid isomerase) to yield all-trans-lycopene, which is further cyclized to β-carotene in melon fruit. Cloning and sequencing of 'yofI' CRTISO identified two mRNA sequences which lead to truncated forms of CRTISO. Sequencing of the genomic CRTISO identified an A-T transversion in 'yofI' which leads to a premature STOP codon. The early carotenoid pathway genes were up regulated in yofI fruit causing accumulation of other intermediates such as phytoene and ζ-carotene. Total carotenoid levels are only slightly increased in the mutant.

Some very polar compounds with a stronger retention on the HILIC column were measured directly. The method was validated for over 300 pesticides in cucumber, lemon, wheat flour, rocket, and black tea. For the large majority of the analytes, the recovery was between 70% and 120% and the relative standard deviation was clearly under 20%. The limits of detection for nearly all the compounds were at least at 0.01 mg/kg. For over 50% of the analytes, good sensitivity was observed even at 0.001 mg/kg.

Among the available microanalytical techniques, synchrotron μ-XRF methods can provide a powerful and versatile array of analytical tools to study Fe distribution within plant samples. In the last years, the implementation of new algorithms and detection technologies has opened the way to more accurate (semi)quantitative analyses of complex matrices like plant materials. In this paper, for the first time the distribution of Fe within tomato roots has been imaged and quantified by means of confocal μ-XRF and exploiting a recently developed fundamental parameter-based algorithm. With this approach, Fe concentrations ranging from few hundreds of ppb to several hundreds of ppm can be determined at the microscopic level without cutting sections.

Hexaconazole is a chiral fungicide used on a variety of crops for the control of many fungal diseases. This use provides opportunities for the pollution of food and soil. In this study, a sensitive and convenient chiral liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for measuring hexaconazole enantiomers in tomato, cucumber, and soil. Separation was by a reversed-phase Chiralcel OD-RH column, under isocratic conditions using a mixture of acetonitrile-2 mM ammonium acetate in water (60/40, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. Parameters including the matrix effect, linearity, precision, accuracy and stability were undertaken. Then the proposed method was successfully applied to investigate the possible enantioselective degradation of rac-hexaconazole in plants (tomato and cucumber) and soil under field conditions. The degradation of the two enantiomers of hexaconazole proved to be enantioselective and dependent on the media: The (+)-enantiomer showed a faster degradation in plants, while the (-)-enantiomer dissipated faster than the (+)-form in field soil, resulting in relative enrichment of the opposite enantiomer.

23332857,"Previous studies have established that whey protein manufacture unit operations influence the flavor of dried whey proteins. Additionally, manufacturers generally instantize whey protein isolate (WPI; ≥ 90% protein) by agglomeration with lecithin to increase solubility and wettability. Whey protein isolate is often subjected to additional postprocessing steps in beverage manufacturing, including acidification and heat treatment. These postprocessing treatments may further influence formation or release of flavors. The objective of the first study was to characterize the effect of 2 processing steps inherent to manufacturing of acidic protein beverages (acidification and heat treatment) on the flavor of non-instant WPI. The second study sought to determine the effect of lecithin agglomeration, a common form of instantized (INST) WPI used in beverage manufacturing, on the flavor of WPI after acidification and heat treatment. In the first experiment, commercial non-instantized (NI) WPI were rehydrated and evaluated as is (control); acidified to pH 3.2; heated to 85°C for 5 min in a benchtop high temperature, short time (HTST) pasteurizer; or acidified to 3.2 and heated to 85°C for 30s (AH-HTST). In the second experiment, INST and NI commercial WPI were subsequently evaluated as control, acidified, heated, or AH-HTST. All samples were evaluated by descriptive sensory analysis, solid-phase microextraction (SPME), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Acidification of NI WPI produced higher concentrations of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and sensory detection of potato/brothy flavors, whereas heating increased cooked/sulfur flavors. Acidification and heating increased cardboard, potato/brothy, and malty flavors and produced higher concentrations of aldehydes, ketones, and sulfur compounds. Differences between INST and NI WPI existed before treatment; INST WPI displayed cucumber flavors not present in NI WPI. After acidification, INST WPI were distinguished by higher intensity of cucumber flavor and higher concentrations of E-2-nonenal. No perceivable differences were observed between INST and NI WPI after heating; sulfur and eggy flavors increased in both types of WPI. After treatment, AH-INST-HTST samples were differentiated from AH-NI-HTST by grassy/hay and grainy flavor and increased lipid oxidation products.

Chiralcel OJ consisting of 25 % of cellulose tris(4-methylbenzoate) coated on wide-pore polysaccharide silica gel exhibited higher resolving ability compared to cellulose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) (Chiralcel OD) as well as to its similar amylose derivative (Chiralpak AD) CSPs for this particular set of chiral analytes. Baseline separation and simultaneous enantioseparation of difenoconazole and its metabolite CGA-205375 could be achieved under optimized separation conditions. Based on the established HPLC method, enantioselective analysis method for this fungicide and its main chiral metabolite in vegetables and soil matrix were developed and validated. Parameters including the matrix effect, linearity, precision, accuracy, and stability were evaluated. Under the optimal conditions, the mean recoveries from cucumber, tomato, and soil matrix ranged from 81.65 to 94.52 %, with relative standard deviations in the range of 1.05-8.32 % for all stereoisomers. Coefficients of determination R(2) ≥ 0.998 were achieved for each enantiomer in the cucumber, tomato and soil matrix calibration curves within the range of 0.5-50 μg mL(-1). The limits of quantification for all enantiomers in three matrices were all below 0.1 μg mL(-1). The methodology was successfully applied for simultaneous enantioselective analysis of difenoconazole stereoisomers and their metabolite in the real samples, indicating its efficacy in investigating the environmental stereochemistry of difenoconazole in food and environmental matrix.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002851', 'D004148', 'D005506', 'D005659', 'D012989', 'D013237', 'D014230', 'D014675']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dioxolanes', 'Food Contamination', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Triazoles', 'Vegetables']",Simultaneous enantioselective determination of triazole fungicide difenoconazole and its main chiral metabolite in vegetables and soil by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22885971,2013
22851152,"Aristolochic acids (AAs) are nephrotoxic and carcinogenic derivatives found in several Aristolochia species. To date, the toxicity of AAs has been inferred only from the effects observed in patients suffering from a kidney disease called ""aristolochic acid nephropathy"" (AAN, formerly known as ""Chinese herbs nephropathy""). More recently, the chronic poisoning with Aristolochia seeds has been considered to be the main cause of Balkan endemic nephropathy, another form of chronic renal failure resembling AAN. So far, it was assumed that AAs can enter the human food chain only through ethnobotanical use (intentional or accidental) of herbs containing self-produced AAs. We hypothesized that the roots of some crops growing in fields where Aristolochia species grew over several seasons may take up certain amounts of AAs from the soil, and thus become a secondary source of food poisoning. To verify this possibility, maize plant (Zea mays) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) were used as a model to substantiate the possible significance of naturally occurring AAs' root uptake in food chain contamination. This study showed that the roots of maize plant and cucumber are capable of absorbing AAs from nutrient solution, consequently producing strong peaks on ultraviolet HPLC chromatograms of plant extracts. This uptake resulted in even higher concentrations of AAs in the roots compared to the nutrient solutions. To further validate the measurement of AA content in the root material, we also measured their concentrations in nutrient solutions before and after the plant treatment. Decreased concentrations of both AAI and AAII were found in nutrient solutions after plant growth. During this short-term experiment, there were much lower concentrations of AAs in the leaves than in the roots. The question is whether these plants are capable of transferring significant amounts of AAs from the roots into edible parts of the plant during prolonged experiments.",Environmental geochemistry and health,"['D034341', 'D001449', 'D002851', 'D018553', 'D005517', 'D006801', 'D018517', 'D003313']","['Aristolochic Acids', 'Balkan Nephropathy', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cucumis sativus', 'Foodborne Diseases', 'Humans', 'Plant Roots', 'Zea mays']",Possible health impacts of naturally occurring uptake of aristolochic acids by maize and cucumber roots: links to the etiology of endemic (Balkan) nephropathy.,"['Q000378', 'Q000209', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000150', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","['metabolism', 'etiology', None, 'metabolism', 'complications', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22851152,2013

22757713,"Cucumbers are preserved commercially by natural fermentations in 5% to 8% sodium chloride (NaCl) brines. Occasionally, fermented cucumbers spoil after the primary fermentation is complete. This spoilage has been characterized by decreases in lactic acid and a rise in brine pH caused by microbial instability. Objectives of this study were to determine the combined effects of NaCl and pH on fermented cucumber spoilage and to determine the ability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) spoilage isolates to initiate lactic acid degradation in fermented cucumbers. Cucumbers fermented with 0%, 2%, 4%, and 6% NaCl were blended into slurries (FCS) and adjusted to pH 3.2, 3.8, 4.3, and 5.0 prior to centrifugation, sterile-filtration, and inoculation with spoilage organisms. Organic acids and pH were measured initially and after 3 wk, 2, 6, 12, and 18 mo anaerobic incubation at 25 °C. Anaerobic lactic acid degradation occurred in FCS at pH 3.8, 4.3, and 5.0 regardless of NaCl concentration. At pH 3.2, reduced NaCl concentrations resulted in increased susceptibility to spoilage, indicating that the pH limit for lactic acid utilization in reduced NaCl fermented cucumbers is 3.2 or lower. Over 18 mo incubation, only cucumbers fermented with 6% NaCl to pH 3.2 prevented anaerobic lactic acid degradation by spoilage bacteria. Among several LAB species isolated from fermented cucumber spoilage, Lactobacillus buchneri was unique in its ability to metabolize lactic acid in FCS with concurrent increases in acetic acid and 1,2-propanediol. Therefore, L. buchneri may be one of multiple organisms that contribute to development of fermented cucumber spoilage.",Journal of food science,"['D001421', 'D002851', 'D018553', 'D005285', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D005519', 'D006863', 'D019344', 'D007777', 'D012965']","['Bacteria, Anaerobic', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cucumis sativus', 'Fermentation', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Food Preservation', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lactobacillaceae', 'Sodium Chloride']","Influence of sodium chloride, pH, and lactic acid bacteria on anaerobic lactic acid utilization during fermented cucumber spoilage.","['Q000187', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000517', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000494']","['drug effects', None, 'chemistry', None, 'prevention & control', None, 'methods', None, 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22757713,2012
22682952,"A liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) methodology based on the use of porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fibres was developed for extracting seven pesticides from cucumbers. The seven pesticides include propoxur, carbofuran, atrazine, cyanatryn, metolachlor, prometryn and tebuconazole. The PVDF hollow fibre provides higher extraction efficiency due to its higher porosity and better solvent compatibility. A new desorption methodology was developed since some pesticides were absorbed by the wall pore of the PVDF. Ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was used for pesticide analysis. In order to obtain high recoveries and enrichment factors of the analytes, several parameters such as method of sealing, acceptor phase (organic solvents), stirring speed, extraction time, salting out effect, desorption mode and time were optimized. A fast, simple method for closing fibre ends was practiced by using mechanical crimping. Pesticides were extracted from the sample to the organic solvent and then desorbed in a mixture of methanol:water (1:1 v/v) prior to chromatographic analysis. Limits of detection (LOD) for the multi-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode of the method varies from 0.01 to 0.31 μg/kg with optimized sample preparation. Calibration curves are linear with R² ≥ 0.991.

Both instruments were coupled to LC and used electrospray ionization. The selectivity of the Orbitrap in the full-scan acquisition mode without fragmentation was evaluated at a resolution of 100 000 full width at half maximum for all pesticides detectable with sufficient sensitivity. For this purpose, quasimolecular ions were extracted within 5 ppm windows from total ion chromatograms of two types of extracts of cucumber, lemon, wheat flour, raisin, and tea. In each of the obtained reconstructed ion chromatograms (individual chromatograms for 500 pesticides, each pesticide in 10 different extracts) the sum of signals not arising from the analyte was used to get a measure on selectivity. In addition, the target analyte list was checked for ions of similar mass. The influence of matrix on the ability to detect low concentrations of fortified pesticides was also studied, with the help of spiked extracts. This part of the survey tested whether analyte peaks were lost because of insufficient mass resolution or an early closing C-Trap (used to control the ion current into the Orbitrap).

20730643,"A rapid, simple and sensitive multi-residue method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 69 pesticides in fruit and vegetables using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The samples were extracted following the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method known as QuEChERS. Mass spectrometric conditions were individually optimised for each analyte in order to achieve maximum sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Using the developed chromatographic conditions, 69 pesticides can be separated in less than 17 min. Two selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays were used for each pesticide to obtain simultaneous quantification and identification in one run. With this method in SRM mode, more than 150 pesticides can be analysed and quantified, but their confirmation is not possible in all cases according to the European regulations on pesticide residues. Nine common representative matrices (zucchini, melon, cucumber, watermelon, tomato, garlic, eggplant, lettuce and pepper) were selected to investigate the effect of different matrices on recovery and precision. Mean recoveries ranged from 70% to 120%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20% for all the pesticides. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of more than 2000 vegetable samples from the extensive greenhouse cultivation in the province of Almeria, Spain, during one year. The methodology combines the advantages of both QuEChERS and LC-MS/MS producing a very rapid, sensitive, accurate and reliable procedure that can be applied in routine analytical laboratories.

20334192,"The matrix effects in HPLC/electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS analysis are difficult to compensate for because of their large variability. It is, therefore, often more practical to include uncertainty due to the matrix effect into the uncertainty budget rather than try to compensate. This work presents an empirical approach--the matrix effect graph approach--for estimating the uncertainty due to the matrix effect in HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. At certain time intervals (1 month), a calibration graph using extracts of different fruits/vegetables as calibration solutions is prepared, and a regression line is fitted through these data. These fruits/vegetables may be either from the commodity group of the samples or from different commodity groups. The relative residuals of the calibration point peak areas are calculated and plotted against the measurement time. We term the resulting graph the matrix effect graph. The root mean square of the relative residuals is calculated and used as the estimate of relative uncertainty of the sample peak areas caused by the matrix effect. The matrix effect graph obtained over fruits/vegetables from different commodity groups can also be used to identify fruits/vegetables with extreme matrix effects. The matrix effect graph approach was used for determination of thiabendazole, aldicarb, imazalil, and methiocarb and was validated with tomato, cucumber, and sweet corn matrixes at the 0.5 mg/kg concentration level. When different commodity groups were used to compile the matrix effect graph, results of analysis of all samples agreed with the spiked concentrations within the expanded uncertainties (at k=2 level).

19733738,"Liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry--LC/ESI/MS--a primary tool for analysis of low volatility compounds in difficult matrices--suffers from the matrix effects in the ESI ionization. It is well known that matrix effects can be reduced by sample dilution. However, the efficiency of simple sample dilution is often limited, in particular by the limit of detection of the method, and can strongly vary from sample to sample. In this study matrix effect is investigated as the function of dilution. It is demonstrated that in some cases dilution can eliminate matrix effect, but often it is just reduced. Based on these findings we propose a new quantitation method based on consecutive dilutions of the sample and extrapolation of the analyte content to the infinite dilution, i.e. to matrix-free solution. The method was validated for LC/ESI/MS analysis of five pesticides (methomyl, thiabendazole, aldicarb, imazalil, methiocarb) in five matrices (tomato, cucumber, apple, rye and garlic) at two concentration levels (0.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1)). Agreement between the analyzed and spiked concentrations was found for all samples. It was demonstrated that in terms of accuracy of the obtained results the proposed extrapolative dilution approach works distinctly better than simple sample dilution. The main use of this approach is envisaged for (a) method development/validation to determine the extent of matrix effects and the ways of overcoming them and (b) as a second step of analysis in the case of samples having analyte contents near the maximum residue limits (MRL).",Analytica chimica acta,[],[],Combating matrix effects in LC/ESI/MS: the extrapolative dilution approach.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733738,2009

High-resolution tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify accurately peptide masses and their constituent sequences from partially purified plant virus preparations. Analysis of the peptide fragment masses against a virus database using pattern-matching algorithms identified sequences with homology to known virus peptides and also predicted peptides using de novo sequence analysis. This method provided sufficient information to confirm the identity of two known viruses that were included as controls (Cucumber mosaic virus and Tomato spotted wilt virus) and to identify unknown viruses in six viral isolates. The unknown viruses have been identified as four common viruses (Alfalfa mosaic virus, Tobacco streak virus, Citrus leaf blotch virus and Ribgrass mosaic virus), and two novel viruses (a potexvirus and a vitivirus). The identification of viruses from five distinct families by the tandem mass spectrometric determination of their coat protein demonstrates that this is a useful method for initial virus identification.

MS/MS can be conceived in two ways: tandem in space (e.g. triple quadrupole, QqQ) or in time (e.g. ion trap, IT). QqQ and IT are commonly interfaced to GC; however, there has not been any direct comparison between them in pesticide residue analysis so far. In the present work, the performance of GC coupled to these two analyzers (GC-QqQ-MS/MS and GC-IT-MS/MS) was studied and compared for pesticide residue analysis as well as its application in food analysis. The large volume injection (LVI) technique together with programmed-temperature vaporization (PTV) was applied. For this purpose, 19 pesticides, including organochlorine and organophophorus pesticides and pyrethroids, were analyzed in both systems. Mass spectrometric data, performance characteristics (linearity, intra-day and inter-day precision) and the influence of the matrix nature on the analysis of low concentrations were compared. The target compounds were analyzed in solvent and in two representative food matrices such as cucumber (high water content) and egg (high fat content). MS data and intra-day precision were similar in QqQ and IT, whereas inter-day precision was significantly worse in QqQ. Linearity (expressed as determination coefficient, R(2)) in the range 10-150 microg L(-1) was adequate in both systems; however, better R(2) values were obtained with the QqQ analyzer in high and low concentration ranges (1-50 and 1-750 microg L(-1), respectively). The influence of the matrix nature on the analysis of low concentrations of each analyzer was also evaluated. The QqQ and IT performance was similar in cucumber and solvent.

The protein expression showed that even with an excess of glucose in all media, both strains could metabolize different carbohydrates simultaneously and that hexoses could also be used via a phosphoketolase pathway with preferential expression in liquid feed. Sugar analyses showed that the fermentation of sugars was homolactic for all media, with some heterolactic activity in liquid feed, as shown by the production of acetate. Cucumber juice (the medium with the highest glucose content) showed the lowest hexose consumption (10%), followed by liquid feed (33%) and MRS broth (50%). However, bacterial growth was significantly higher in cucumber juice and liquid feed than in MRS broth.

In vitro challenge assays were used to screen approximately 500 bacterial isolates from 20 Korean greenhouse soils for inhibition of diverse plant pathogens. One isolate, Bacillus subtilis ME488, suppressed the growth of 39 of 42 plant pathogens tested. Isolate ME488 also suppressed the disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum on cucumber and Phytophthora capsici on pepper in pot assays. Polymerase chain reaction was used to screen isolate ME488 for genes involved in biosynthesis of 11 antibiotics produced by various isolates of B. subtilis. Amplicons of the expected sizes were detected for bacD and bacAB, ituC and ituD, and mrsA and mrsM involved in the biosynthesis of bacilysin, iturin, and mersacidin, respectively.

The triple quadrupole (QqQ) analyzer simultaneously operated in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and selected ion monitoring (SIM) modes, acquiring two or three transitions per compound. Samples were extracted by the application of a single-phase extraction of 10 g of sample with acetonitrile containing 1% of acetic acid, followed by a liquid-liquid partition formed by the addition of 4 g of MgSO(4) and 1 g of NaOAc. A dispersive solid-phase extraction (D-SPE) with primary secondary amine (PSA) was applied to clean up the extracts. A final concentration step was included in order to increase sensitivity in the instrumental analysis. The method was properly validated in each matrix in a wide dynamic range (10-400 microg kg(-1)): this work relies on a new quantification strategy by the use of two calibration curves to increase the dynamic range, which permitted reduction of sample dilutions and increase in sample throughput.

18264780,"A combined chemical, biochemical and molecular study was conducted to understand the differential accumulation of volatile sesquiterpenes in melon fruits. Sesquiterpenes were present mainly in the rinds of climacteric varieties, and a great diversity in their composition was found among varieties. Sesquiterpenes were generally absent in non-climacteric varieties. Two climacteric melon varieties, the green-fleshed 'Noy Yizre'el', and the orange-fleshed 'Dulce' were further examined. In 'Noy Yizre'el' the main sesquiterpenes accumulated are delta-cadinene, gamma-cadinene and alpha-copaene, while alpha-farnesene is the main sesquiterpene in 'Dulce'. Sesquiterpene synthase activities, mainly restricted to rinds of mature fruits, were shown to generate different sesquiterpenes in each variety according to the compositions found in rinds. EST melon database mining yielded two novel cDNAs coding for members of the Tps gene family termed CmTpsNY and CmTpsDul respectively, that are 43.2% similar. Heterologous expression in E. coli of CmTpsNY produced mainly delta-copaene, alpha-copaene, beta-caryophyllene, germacrene D, alpha-muurolene, gamma-cadinene, delta-cadinene, and alpha-cadinene, while CmTpsDul produced alpha-farnesene only. CmTpsNY was mostly expressed in 'Noy Yizre'el' rind while CmTpsDul expression was specific to 'Dulce' rind. None of these genes was expressed in rinds of the non-climacteric 'Tam Dew' cultivar. Our results indicate that different sesquiterpene synthases encoded by different members of the Tps gene family are active in melon varieties and this specificity modulates the accumulation of sesquiterpenes. The genes are differentially transcriptionally regulated during fruit development and according to variety and are likely to be associated with chemical differences responsible for the unique aromas of melon varieties.",Plant molecular biology,"['D000595', 'D015152', 'D019755', 'D003001', 'D028463', 'D008401', 'D015971', 'D018506', 'D008969', 'D015394', 'D010802', 'D010940', 'D000081223', 'D016133', 'D011994', 'D017386', 'D012717', 'D052617', 'D013045']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carbon-Carbon Lyases', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cucumis melo', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Proteins', 'Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Species Specificity']",The molecular and biochemical basis for varietal variation in sesquiterpene content in melon (Cucumis melo L.) rinds.,"[None, None, 'Q000145', None, 'Q000201', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, None, 'classification', None, 'enzymology', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18264780,2008

17909760,"The Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe multiresidue method (QuEChERS) has been validated for the extraction of 80 pesticides belonging to various chemical classes from various types of representative commodities with low lipid contents. A mixture of 38 pesticides amenable to gas chromatography (GC) were quantitatively recovered from spiked lemon, raisins, wheat flour and cucumber, and determined using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). An additional mixture of 42 pesticides were recovered from oranges, red wine, red grapes, raisins and wheat flour, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for determination. The pesticides chosen for this study included many of the most frequently detected ones and/or those that are most often found to violate the maximum residue limit (MRL) in food samples, some compounds that have only recently been introduced, as well as a few other miscellaneous compounds. The method employed involved initial extraction in a water/acetonitrile system, an extraction/partitioning step after the addition of salt, and a cleanup step utilizing dispersive solid-phase extraction (D-SPE); this combination ensured that it was a rapid, simple and cost-effective procedure. The spiking levels for the recovery experiments were 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.2 mg kg(-1) for GC-MS/MS analyses, and 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) for LC-MS/MS analyses. Adequate pesticide quantification and identity confirmation were attained, even at the lowest concentration levels, considering the high signal-to-noise ratios, the very good accuracies and precisions, as well as the good matches between the observed ion ratios.

The composition of sphingoid bases prepared from sea cucumber was different from that of mammals, and the major constituents estimated from mass spectra had a branched C17-19 alkyl chain with 1-3 double bonds. The viability of DLD-1, WiDr and Caco-2 cells treated with sea cucumber sphingoid bases was reduced in a dose-dependent manner and was similar to that of cells treated with sphingosine. The sphingoid bases induced such a morphological change as condensed chromatin fragments and increased the caspase-3 activity, indicating that the sphingoid bases reduced the cell viability by causing apoptosis in these cells.

Pesticides were extracted from homogenized food samples with acetonitrile and decontaminated via the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) technique, using a primary secondary amine as sorbent prior to GPC-GC/MS analysis. A slightly modified preparation method and automated GPC step proved useful in minimizing matrix interference. To evaluate the performance of the system, 97 target pesticides were spiked at a concentration of 0.1mg/kg into a range of food types, including potato, cabbage, carrot, apple, orange, cucumber, and rice. A low flow rate of 0.1 mL/min in GPC resulted in a 40-fold reduction in solvent consumption compared with conventional GPC column applications. The combination of MSPD technique and GPC-GC/MS for the analysis of the 97 pesticides can be accomplished within 90 min. Most pesticides were recovered in the range of 70-120%, with relative standard deviation generally less than 10%.

Volatile ester compounds generally decreased during fresh-cut storage or exhibited a transient increase before declining after 5-7 days of storage.

Although trans-zeatin riboside (ZR), the most abundant cytokinin in squash xylem sap, had a concentration-dependent effect similar to that of total squash xylem sap, ZR concentrations several orders of magnitude greater than those found endogenously in squash xylem sap (i.e. 2 x 10(-8) M) were required to affect the growth of BY-2 cell protoplasts. The ability to stimulate cell elongation and inhibit cell division in BY-2 cell protoplasts was observed for the ethyl acetate phase fraction (pH 2) of squash xylem sap and an acetonitrile-eluate fraction from reverse-phase chromatography. The xylem sap also showed inhibitory activity for auxin-induced elongation of excised cucumber hypocotyls. These results suggest that an organic substance other than ZR is produced in the root and transported to above-ground organs through the xylem via the transpiration stream, where it is involved in regulating cell proliferation and elongation in the shoot, possibly as an auxin antagonist.",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,"['D000241', 'D018929', 'D002455', 'D049109', 'D048430', 'D002478', 'D005591', 'D028464', 'D018546', 'D007541', 'D018517', 'D011523', 'D013997', 'D014026']","['Adenosine', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Cucurbita', 'Hypocotyl', 'Isopentenyladenosine', 'Plant Roots', 'Protoplasts', 'Time Factors', 'Tobacco']",Squash xylem sap has activities that inhibit proliferation and promote the elongation of tobacco BY-2 cell protoplasts.,"['Q000031', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000031', 'Q000378', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000166']","['analogs & derivatives', None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'analogs & derivatives', 'metabolism', 'cytology', None, 'cytology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15890518,2005

Accurate mass measurements within 3 ppm error were obtained for all the pesticides studied in various vegetable matrixes (cucumber, tomato, lettuce, pepper), which allowed an unequivocal identification of the target pesticides. Calibration curves covering 2 orders of magnitude were linear over the concentration range studied, thus showing the quantitative ability of TOF-MS as a monitoring tool for pesticides in vegetables. Matrix effects were also evaluated using matrix-matched standards showing no significant interferences between matrixes and clean extracts. Intraday reproducibility was 2-3% relative standard deviation (RSD) and interday values were 5% RSD. The precision (standard deviation) of the mass measurements was evaluated and it was less than 0.23 mDa between days. Detection limits of the chloronicotinyl insecticides in salad vegetables ranged from 0.002 to 0.01 mg/kg. These concentrations are equal to or better than the EU directives for controlled pesticides in vegetables showing that LC/TOF-MS analysis is a powerful tool for identification of pesticides in vegetables. Robustness and applicability of the method was validated for the analysis of market vegetable samples.

15276438,"Many different proteins can be separated from the sap of mature sieve tubes of different plant species. To date, only a limited number of those have been identified and functionally characterised. Due to sieve tubes inability of transcription and translation, the proteins are most probably synthesised in the intimately connected companion cells and transported into the sieve elements through plasmodesmata. The specific protein composition of phloem sap suggests an important role of these proteins not only for sieve tube maintenance, but also for whole plant physiology and development. Here we describe a comprehensive analysis of the phloem protein composition employing one- and high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and partial sequencing by mass spectrometry. In this study more than 300 partial sequences generated by hybrid mass spectrometry were used to identify a total of 45 different proteins from the phloem exudates of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Hoffmanns Giganta) and pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima Duch. cv. Gelber Zentner) plants. In addition to previously described phloem proteins, it was possible to localise proteins with high similarity to an acyl-CoA binding protein, a glyoxalase, a malate dehydrogenase, a rhodanese-like protein, a drought-induced protein, and a beta-glucosidase.

Structural analysis suggested that type A consists of a backbone of (1-->3)-linked fucosyl residues that are substituted at C-4 with fucosyl residues, and that fucosyl residues are sulfated at C-2 and/or C-4. Another type (type B) contained 3.90 mmol fucose/g and 3.07 mmol sulfate/g, and the molecular mass was determined to be 32kDa by GPC. Structural analysis showed that type B is largely composed of unbranched (1-->3)-linked fucosyl residues, and that sulfate substitution(s) occur at C-2 and/or C-4. The potential of both types to inhibit osteoclastogenesis was examined by an in vitro assay system, showing that both types of fucan sulfate inhibit osteoclastogenesis more than 95% at 50 microg/mL concentration.

Fifty bands resulted in amino acid sequence information that was used to perform database similarity searches. Sequences from 30 bands showed high homology to proteins present in databases. Among them, we found mostly peroxidases, but could also identify the lectin-like xylem protein XSP30, a glycine-rich protein, serine proteases, an aspartyl protease family protein, chitinases, and a lipid transfer protein-like polypeptide. Sequence analysis predicted apoplastic secretion signals for all database entries similar to the partial xylem protein sequences. This and the lack of cross-reactivity with phloem protein-specific antibodies suggest that the proteins really originate from the xylem and do not result from phloem contamination. Most of the highly similar proteins probably function in repair and defence reactions.

Some fatty acids known to be aroma precursors originate from microalgae such as Skeletonema costatum and Tahitian isochrysis clone. These microalgae were used to fatten oysters in order to observe their role in the development of oysters' aroma. This study shows that the profile of fatty acids of oysters is influenced by the contribution of fatty acids from the two microalgae (as reported in the first paper in this series: Pennarun, A.-L.; Prost, C.; Haure, J.; Demaimay, M.

As a consequence, a microalgal diet causes changes in oysters' aroma composition. Aroma concentration depends on the content of fatty acids that are aroma precursors in oysters. Some aromas are characteristic of the diet of S. costatum, such as 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (ether odor), and others are characteristic of T. isochrysis, such as 3-nonyne (cucumber, marine odor), 6-(E)-nonen-1-ol (green and fresh odor), and 4-ethylbenzaldehyde (aniseed odor).

GC-FPD analysis showed the presence of four different organo-phosphorus (OP) pesticides, their levels were very low and below maximum residue limits (MRL's). GC-ECD detected ten different pesticides at levels below the MRL's. Using the GC-MS technique, alpha and beta-endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, carbofuran, chlorfluazuron, triadimenol I and II, penconazole, coptafolmetabolite, pyrimethanil and iprodione were detected and confirmed on some samples of cucumber, tomatoes and strawberries. All GC-MS pesticide residues detected on tomato were below the MRL's except chlorfluazuron while on strawberry were below the MRL's except penconazole, chlorfluazuron and pyrimethanil, but on cucumber were slightly higher than the MRL's except alpha and beta-endosulfan. Also, statistical analysis of pesticide residues in all samples showed that most of the detected residues mean were significantly lower than the MRL's (p < 0.05). Generally, tomatoes showed the least number and level of pesticide residues by all the GC-techniques. On the other hand, strawberries showed greater number and levels of pesticide residues, particularly by the GC-MS technique.

11798108,"Two flow-injection manifolds have been investigated for the determination of nitrate. These manifolds are based on the reduction of nitrate to nitrite and determination of nitrite by gas-phase molecular absorption spectrophotometry. Nitrate sample solution (300 microL) which is injected to the flow line, is reduced to nitrite by reaction with hydrazine or passage through the on-line copperized cadmium (Cd-Cu) reduction column. The nitrite produced reacts with a stream of hydrochloric acid and the evolved gases are purged into the stream of O2 carrier gas. The gaseous phase is separated from the liquid phase using a gas-liquid separator and then swept into a flow-through cell which has been positioned in the cell compartment of an UV-visible spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the gaseous phase is measured at 204.7 nm. A linear relationship was obtained between the intensity of absorption signals and concentration of nitrate when Cd-Cu reduction method was used, but a logarithmic relationship was obtained when the hydrazine reduction method was used. By use of the Cd-Cu reduction method, up to 330 microg of nitrate was determined. The limit of detection was 2.97 microg nitrate and the relative standard deviations for the determination of 12.0, 30.0 and 150 microg nitrate were 3.32, 3.87 and 3.6%, respectively.

Additionally, the main lutein diesters naturally occurring in marigold oleoresin were chromatographically separated and identified.

11599982,"Dithiocarbamates are a class of fungicides extensively used in many crops worldwide. The current residue definition of dithiocarbamates in food for compliance with maximum residue limits, at national and international levels, is total residues arising from the use of any or each dithiocarbamate fungicide, determined as CS(2). The analytical method most frequently used to analyze dithiocarbamate residues in food for monitoring purposes was proposed more than 30 years ago. In this method, total dithiocarbamates are decomposed to CS(2), which is purified and reacted with a cupric reagent. The yellow complex formed is quantified by spectrophotometry. In this paper, a new reaction system for the purification and complexation of CS(2) is proposed. The new system is less fragile than the traditional design, is easier to assemble, and allows for a higher sample throughput, in addition to being of low cost. Recovery of added mancozeb, thiram, or ziram (0.15-8.0 mg/kg) in rice, beans, apple, banana, orange, papaya, tomato, cucumber, and potato ranged from 82 to 120%, with relative standard deviations from 0 to 10% (n = 3 or 5).

Recent evidence has suggested that a secreted protein is responsible for the interactions that lead to an increase in tissue stiffness (Trotter and Koob, 1995). Structurally intact collagen fibrils have been isolated from such a connective tissue- the dermis of the sea cucumber Cucumaria frondosa- and used in an assay in vitro to identify a protein that binds to them and causes them to aggregate. This protein has been purified by anion-exchange and molecular sieve chromatography. It is eluted from a MonoQ column at approximately 0.55 M NaCl. Its isoelectric point is 5.2. It elutes from a Superose-6 column in a position corresponding to a molecule with a Stokes radius of 11.5 nm. Its native molecular weight estimated from sedimentation equilibrium analysis under non-denaturing conditions is 375,000, and its monomer molecular weight, estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, is approximately 350,000. Sedimentation velocity measurements indicated for the native molecule a sedimentation coefficient of 11 x 10(-13)s, a diffusion coefficient of 3.274 x 10(-7) cm2s-1, and a frictional ratio of 1.95, which corresponds to a prolate ellipsoid of revolution with an axial ratio of 19.

3450102,"Seven trypsin inhibitors were isolated from the seeds of Cucurbitaceae plants: two from cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and red bryony (Bryonia diotica) and one from figleaf gourd (Cucurbita ficifolia), spaghetti squash (Cucurbita pepo var. (vegetable spaghetti) and water melon (Citrullus vulgaris). The inhibitors were purified by fractionation with ammonium sulphate, followed by ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography using immobilized trypsin or anhydro-trypsin. The homogeneous inhibitors from cucumber and water melon are made up of 32 and 30 amino acid residues, respectively, whereas the remaining ones of 29 residues. All inhibitors contain three disulphide bridges and are free of threonine, phenylalanine and tryptophan. Inhibitors from spaghetti squash and CSTI IIb from cucumber are inactivated by acetylation of free amino groups whereas the remaining ones are inactivated by modification of arginine with 1,2-cyclohexanedione. Thus the P1 residues of the reactive sites of the inhibitors are lysine and arginine, respectively.",Acta biochimica Polonica,"['D000596', 'D010944', 'D012639', 'D014361']","['Amino Acids', 'Plants', 'Seeds', 'Trypsin Inhibitors']",Protein inhibitors of trypsin from the seeds of Cucurbitaceae plants.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000302']","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3450102,1988
24306908,"Fractionation of headspace volatiles from Cucurbita maxima blossoms by high-performance liquid chromatography resulted in the isolation of a single component which was highly active in an electroantennogram bioassay on Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi antennae. This compound was identified as indole by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Field-trapping bioassays were conducted which indicated that indole is a potent attractant of the western corn rootworm,D. virgifera virgifera, and the striped cucumber beetle,Acalymma vittatum. The southern corn rootworm,D. u. howardi, did not respond, despite its strong EAG response. The sex ratio ofD. v. virgifera found in indole-baited traps varied seasonally. Males were trapped in abundance in late July and later September, 1983, while females were more abundant August and early September. The effectiveness of indole as aD. v. virgifera attractant also varied seasonally. A prolonged period of depressed trap catches occurred in early August 1983, during the silking and tasseling period of the corn in the field where trapping was carried out.",Journal of chemical ecology,[],[],Identification of a volatile attractant for Diabrotica and Acalymma spp. from blossoms of Cucurbita maxima duchesne.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24306908,2015
16662510,"Leaf discs and detached leaves exposed to l-cysteine emitted a volatile sulfur compound which was proven by gas chromatography to be H(2)S. This phenomenon was demonstrated in all nine species tested (Cucumis sativus, Cucurbita pepo, Nicotiana tabacum, Coleus blumei, Beta vulgaris, Phaseolus vulgaris, Medicago sativa, Hordeum vulgare, and Gossypium hirsutum). The emission of volatile sulfur by cucumber leaves occurred in the dark at a similar rate to that in the light. The emission of leaf discs reached the maximal rate, more than 40 picomoles per minute per square centimeter, 2 to 4 hours after starting exposure to l-cysteine; then it decreased. In the case of detached leaves, the maximum occurred 5 to 10 h after starting exposure. The average emission rate of H(2)S during the first 4 hours from leaf discs of cucurbits in response to 10 millimolar l-cysteine, was usually more than 40 picomoles per minute per square centimeter, i.e. 0.24 micromoles per hour per square decimeter. Leaf discs exposed to 1 millimolar l-cysteine emitted only 2% as much as did the discs exposed to 10 millimolar l-cysteine. The emission from leaf discs and from detached leaves lasted for at least 5 and 15 hours, respectively. However, several hours after the maximal emission, injury of the leaves, manifested as chlorosis, was evident. H(2)S emission was a specific consequence of exposure to l-cysteine; neither d-cysteine nor l-cystine elicited H(2)S emission. Aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes, inhibited the emission. In a cell free system from cucumber leaves, H(2)S formation and its release occurred in response to l-cysteine. Feeding experiments with [(35)S]l-cysteine showed that most of the sulfur in H(2)S was derived from sulfur in the l-cysteine supplied and that the H(2)S emitted for 9 hours accounted for 7 to 10% of l-cysteine taken up. (35)S-labeled SO(3) (2-) and SO(4) (2-) were found in the tissue extract in addition to internal soluble S(2-). These findings suggest the existence of a sulfur cycle which converts l-cysteine to SO(4) (2-) through cysteine desulfhydration.",Plant physiology,[],[],Emission of Hydrogen Sulfide by Leaf Tissue in Response to l-Cysteine.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16662510,2010
534476,"Lectins are present in the exudate (presumably from the phloem) of the fruits of three species of the Cucurbitaceae, namely vegetable marrow (Cucurbita pepo), melon (Cucumis melo) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus). They are all strongly inhibited in their activities by chitin oligosaccharides, but only weakly by N-acetylglucosamine. Glycopeptides from soya-bean agglutinin and fetuin are also strong inhibitors of Cucurbita pepo lectin, indicating that it interacts with internal N-acetylglucosamine residues. The lectin from Cucurbita pepo fruit was purified by affinity chromatography by using chitin oligosaccharides covalently attached to Sepharose. The lectin is not a glycoprotein, and it consists of a single polypeptide chain of about 20,000 mol.wt. It is a major protein (18% of the total) of the phloem exudate and it is postulated that it may have an anti-parasitic function.",The Biochemical journal,"['D000117', 'D000371', 'D000596', 'D055598', 'D002621', 'D037102', 'D009844', 'D014674']","['Acetylglucosamine', 'Agglutination', 'Amino Acids', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Lectins', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Plant Proteins, Dietary']","A lectin from the exudate of the fruit of the vegetable marrow (Cucurbita pepo) that has a specificity for beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharides.","[None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000302', None, 'Q000302']","[None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'isolation & purification', None, 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/534476,1980
