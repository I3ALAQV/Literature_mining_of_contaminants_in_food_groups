35327266,"Kefalograviera is a well-known hard Greek cheese. The aim of this study was to determine how milk produced from ewes fed omega-3-enriched diets could influence the microbiota as well as the chemical composition of Kefalograviera cheese. At the start of the trial, 30 dairy ewes (Lesvos and Chios crossbreed) were selected and fed a conventional diet, based on alfalfa hay, straw and concentrate feed that contained soybean meal for a period of thirty days. Then, for a period of sixty days the same ewes were fed an omega-3-enriched concentrate feed with a lower level of soybean meal that contained 10% flaxseed and 10% lupins. Milk yield was collected individually on Days 30, 60 and 90 and used to produce three different batches of Kefalograviera cheeses, at the same cheese factory, by using a traditional recipe and identical preparation conditions (pasteurization of milk, salt, rennet and culture). Sample analysis was done after six months of Kefalograviera cheese ripening. MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry) identification was performed by contrasting the samples' mass spectra with the corresponding reference database.

35304181,"The study aimed to investigate the potentially toxic trace elements (PTEs) Pb, Cd, Hg, Mo, and Cu in dairy products sold in Yerevan's markets and to assess the related exposure and possible health risks among the adult population residing in the capital city of Armenia, Yerevan. The PTEs contents were determined in widely consumed dairy products (pasteurized milk, sour cream, matsoun and cheese from cow milk) using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. PTE contents were in the range of 7.90E-04 (Pb in pasteurized milk) to 6.75E-01 (Cu in cheese) mg/kg. Food consumption was assessed by the 24-h dietary recall method. The PTE daily intakes and margin of exposure (MOE) were calculated by the deterministic approach. The results indicated potential health concerns for the contribution of dairy products to the overall dietary intake of Pb and Cd. MOEs of Pb and Cd (8.71 and 8.80, respectively) estimated for high consumers of cheese (90 g/day and more) were lower than 10.

35275370,"Lead (Pb) is a highly neurotoxic chemical element known for reducing intelligence quotient (IQ) and promoting antisocial behavior in children and adolescents, while cadmium (Cd) is a carcinogenic bioaccumulative element. Both these metals are included in the priority pollutant list of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and in the WHO List of Chemicals of Major Public Health Concern, where contaminated foods and beverages are the most common pathways of exposure. The objective of this study was to determine total Cd and Pb levels in colored plastic utensils (cups, mugs, bowls, feeding bottles, and plates) for use by children and to measure the specific migration of these elements into beverages and foods. Total contaminant levels were determined using a handheld X-ray fluorescence analyzer. Specific migration tests were conducted using the simulant solutions acetic acid 3% (m/v) and water. Migration levels were determined by ICP-MS. Specific migration tests for Pb were also performed on commercially available samples (cola soft drink, orange juice, vinegar, and milk), with levels determined by graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF-AAS). A total of 674 utensils were analyzed in loco at major commercial centers in Greater São Paulo, of which 87 were purchased for containing Cd and Pb concentrations above permitted limits. Mean concentrations of the metals detected in the purchased utensils were 1110 ppm for Pb and 338 ppm for Cd. For specific migration assays, Pb levels were 187, 13, and 380 times above the permitted limit (0.01 mg.kg -1) for acetic acid, water, and orange juice, respectively. Cd levels were 50 and 2.4 times above the maximum permitted limit (0.005 mg.kg -1) for acetic acid and water, respectively. The districts where the utensils were purchased were grouped according to their social vulnerability index and compared using ANOVA. Pb levels were different between low and medium/high social vulnerability groups (p = 0.006). The findings corroborate the initial hypothesis that these utensils constitute a major source of exposure to PTEs such as Cd and Pb, pointing to the need for stricter regulation and inspection by the Brazilian regulatory agencies.",Environmental science and pollution research international,[],[],Study of controlled migration of cadmium and lead into foods from plastic utensils for children.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35275370,2022
35237645,"Flaxseed supplementation in diet of dairy cow can effectively enhance the production of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) in raw milk, which further give rise to the changes of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, we used headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) to investigate the VOCs in milk from cows fed three different diets (CK: supplemented with 0 g/d flaxseed; WF: 1,500 g/d whole flaxseed and GF: 1,500 g/d ground flaxseed). A total of 40 VOCs including three acids, six esters, 11 aldehydes, seven alcohols, 13 ketones were identified in all the raw milk samples. Compared with GF supplementation, suppling with WF could influence more compounds in raw milk (GF: five compounds; WF: 22 compounds). Supplementation with WF could increase the concentration of nonanal, heptanal, hexanal, which could cause the occurrence of off-flavors, and reduce the concentration of hexanoic acid (monomer; M), 2-hexanol, ethanol (M), 2-heptanone (dimer; D), 2-pentanone (M), 2-pentanone (D), acetoin (M) in raw milk. GF supplementation in diet could reduce the 2-pentanone (M), 2-pentanone (D). In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) based on the signal intensity of identified VOCs indicated that it is possible to distinguish between the CK and WF milk. However, GF milk could not be distinguished from CK milk. The results demonstrate that compared with GF milk, WF supplementation in diet of dairy cows could increase fishy (heptanal) cardboard-like (pentanal) flavor in milk and decrease sweet (hexanoic acid, 2-heptanone), fruity (ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2-heptanone) flavor which may lead the milk less acceptable. In conclusion, compared with WF, GF supplementation in diet of dairy cow showed higher increase in n-3 PUFA in raw milk, and less influence in VOCs of raw milk and this study might provide theoretical supports for the production of milk rich in n-3 PUFA.",Frontiers in nutrition,[],[],Effect of Flaxseed Supplementation in Diet of Dairy Cow on the Volatile Organic Compounds of Raw Milk by HS-GC-IMS.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35237645,2022

34985214,"Chlorpropham is a plant growth regulator and a herbicide. It is commonly used in the post-harvest treatment of potato to inhibit germination. It can also be used for flower thinning and fruit thinning of fruit trees, and for controlling annual gramineous weeds and a few broad-leaved weeds. Improper or excessive use of chlorpropham in crop cultivation will affect the safety of animal-derived food and impair human health through the food chain and water cycle. Therefore, accurate quantification of chlorpropham is imperative for risk assessment and mitigating risks to food safety. A method based on solid phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS) was established for the determination of chlorpropham in animal-derived food. First, the pretreatment conditions were optimized. To purify the samples and remove impurities, SPE column cartridges with different packing materials such as PXC, PXA, Florisil, and PLS were investigated. Based on the retention of chlorpropham, the ProElut PLS SPE column was selected as the pretreatment purification column. The washing solution and eluents were then optimized. When water was used as the washing solution, chlorpropham remained adsorbed on the SPE column and was not eluted along with other water-soluble substances. When the proportion of acetonitrile exceeded 40%, chlorpropham adsorbed on the filler of the SPE column could be gradually washed down. Acetonitrile-water solution(30∶70, v/v) was used for washing the SPE column. The elution ability of seven eluents for chlorpropham on the SPE column was then investigated. Among them, pure methanol, pure acetonitrile, and 1% (v/v) formic acid-methanol showed better elution effect. Considering that acetonitrile was used in the sample extraction, it was chosen as the mobile phase eluent. Subsequently, the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters were optimized. By examining the ionization cracking of chlorpropham, the quasimolecular ions and corresponding fragmentations in the chlorpropham primary MS were determined. The separation effect of three C18 columns was investigated. Based on the retention ability and peak effect of chlorpropham on the column, the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) column was used for chlorpropham separation. The response of chlorpropham in the positive and negative ionization modes was investigated and optimized. The results showed that the response was better in the positive ion mode than that in the negative ion mode. After optimizing the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters, the sensitivity of the method was improved.

Being the main byproduct of cheese-making, the revalorization of milk whey is nowadays one of the primary goals in alignment with the principles of the circular economy. In the present paper, a deep and detailed investigation of short endogenous peptides in milk and its byproducts (whole whey, skimmed whey, and whey permeate) was carried out by high-resolution mass spectrometry, with a dedicated suspect screening data acquisition and data analysis approach. A total of 79 short peptides was tentatively identified, including several sequences already known for their exerted biological activities. An unsupervised chemometric approach was then employed for highlighting the differences in the short peptide content among the four sets of samples. Whole and skimmed whey showed not merely a higher content of short bioactive peptides compared to whole milk, but also a peculiar composition of peptides that are likely generated during the process of cheese-making. The results clearly demonstrate that whey represents a valuable source of bioactive compounds and that the set-up of processes of revalorization of milk byproducts is a promising path in the obtention of high revenue-generating products from dairy industrial waste.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000818', 'D003611', 'D000077488', 'D005504', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D010455', 'D057786']","['Animals', 'Dairy Products', 'Data Science', 'Food Analysis', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Peptides', 'Peptidomimetics']",High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry and Chemometrics for the Detailed Characterization of Short Endogenous Peptides in Milk By-Products.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34770881,2021

The acceptable daily intake of steviol is 0-4 mg/kg body weight. The rising demand for dairy products has led to a corresponding increase in the use of steviol glycosides in such products. Therefore, it is important to analyze the levels of steviol glycosides in dairy products. Dairy products have high fat contents and unique emulsion characteristics, conferred by a mixture of fat globules, casein micelles, whey proteins, and numerous other small molecules. These characteristics may interfere with the estimation of steviol glycoside levels; therefore, dairy samples require pretreatment. We aimed to develop an objective test for measuring the levels of steviol glycosides through the development of an efficient pretreatment method. In this study, the steviol glycoside content in dairy products was evaluated by using various methods, and an optimal pretreatment method was determined. We used high-performance liquid chromatography to assess the selectivity, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, precision, and recovery rate. Calibration curves were linear in the range of 1-50 mg/kg, with a coefficient of determination of ≥0.999. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were in the ranges of 0.11-0.56 and 0.33-1.69 mg/kg, respectively. The relative standard deviation (%) represents the precision of a measurement. The RSD relative standard deviationof recovery varied between 0.16% and 2.83%, and recovery of the analysis varied between 83.57% and 104.84%. These results demonstrate the reliability of the method for measuring the steviol glycoside content.

34677016,"As among the most widely used pesticides in agriculture, plant growth regulators (PGRs) have a positive influence on plants. However, the overuse of PGRs may induce toxicity in food and even be hazardous to human health. Numerous studies have investigated the presence and residues of PGRs on vegetables and fruits. Animal-derived foods are one of the most dominant food sources providing nutrients to fulfil the daily dietary intake, and could also be potentially contaminated by PGRs. However, there is little information on PGR residues in animal-derived foods. Standardization also lacks among the techniques for PGR determination in animal-derived foods, thereby restricting the further establishment of pesticide usage and food safety regulations. Therefore, in this study, a rapid and effective method for analyzing chlormequat chloride, thidiazuron, and paclobutrazol in animal-derived food samples was established.

The whole genome of these two lactobacilli was first sequenced. Then, the thermoresistance was evaluated after treatment at 60 °C for 5 min and compared to reference strains. Both lactobacilli were highly thermoresistant compared to other three lactic acid bacteria which are Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris ATCC 19257 and SK11, and L. plantarum ATCC 14917 (P < 0.0001). They lost less than 1 log cfu/mL (Δlog) and their genome contained a great number of copy number of genes coding for heat shock protein. During a Pearce test activity simulating Cheddar cheesemaking, the two lactobacilli did not show interaction with the starter Lcc. lactis subsp. cremoris SK11, and their population remained stable. During a ripening simulation, L. delbrueckii RKG R10 had a slight loss in viability in cheese slurry samples incubated at 30 °C for 12 d. However, L. plantarum RKG 2-212 had considerable growth, from 6.51 to 8.3 log cfu/g. This growth was associated with the acidification of the slurries (P < 0.0001). The presence of the lactobacilli modified the profile of volatile compounds evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, accounting for 10.7% of the variation. The strain L. plantarum RKG 2-212 produced volatile compounds in greater quantity that could be associated with organoleptic defects such as acetic acid and 2-methylbutyraldehyde. Therefore, silage can be a vector of thermoresistant lactic acid bacteria for milk which can lead to flavor defects in cheese.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D056546', 'D017045', 'D013294', 'D008892']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Lactobacillales', 'Lactococcus', 'Lactococcus lactis', 'Milk']",Effect of two thermoresistant non-starter lactic acid bacteria strains on volatilome profile during Cheddar ripening simulation.,"[None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235', None]","[None, None, 'genetics', None, 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34509932,2021

For this purpose, raw milk was artificially contaminated to different antibiotic levels and then heat-treated to prepare fresh cheese from it. Antibiotic levels of the milk, whey and cheese were measured with LC-MS/MS. The extent of heat degradation was not sufficient to remove the antibiotic residues from milk. Antibiotic concentrations in whey and fresh cheese were in good accordance with the concentration of the same compound in milk suggesting that contamination of the milk will result in contamination of the product. The investigated antibiotics were transferred less into the cheese curd (1.6-12.5% of the original amount), than into the whey (33.2-74.1%).

Environmental factors are suspected to contribute to such compositional variation, however, their impact on breast milk composition is currently poorly understood. We sought to (1) define the impact of maternal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on lipid composition of human breast milk, and (2) to study the combined impact of maternal PFAS exposure and breast milk lipid composition on the growth of the infants.In a mother-infant study (n = 44) we measured the levels of PFAS and lipids in maternal serum and conducted lipidomics analysis of breast milk collect 2-4 days after the delivery and at 3 months of infant age, by using ultra high performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Gastrointestinal biomarkers fecal calprotectin and human beta defensin 2 were measured in the stool samples at the age of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Maternal diet was studied by a validated food frequency questionnaire. PFAS levels were inversely associated with total lipid levels in the breast milk collected after the delivery. In the high exposure group, the ratio of acylated saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in triacylglycerols was increased. Moreover, high exposure to PFAS associated with the altered phospholipid composition, which was indicative of unfavorable increase in the size of milk fat globules. These changes in the milk lipid composition were further associated with slower infant growth and with elevated intestinal inflammatory markers.

Peptide performance criteria (retention time, signal-to-noise ratio, and ion ratio tolerance) were established and quantification approaches using varying calibrants, internal standards, background matrices, and calibration curve preparation schemes were systematically evaluated to refine the previous method for routine laboratory use. A matrix-matched calibration curve using allergen ingredients as calibrants and stable isotope-labeled peptides as internal standards provided the most accurate quantitative results. The strategy was further verified with commercially available reference materials and allowed for the confident detection and quantification of food allergens.

Whey offers opportunities for the food industrial sector to develop functional foods with potential health benefits due to its unique physiological and functional attributes. Despite all the above importance, the consumption of whey protein (WP) can trigger hypersensitive reactions and is a constant threat for sensitive individuals. Although avoiding such food products is the most successful approach, there is still a chance of incorrect labeling and cross-contamination during food processing. As whey allergens in food products are cross-reactive, the phenomenon of homologous milk proteins of various species may escalate to a more serious problem.

Comparing between different juice models, significant differences were observed for AFB1 residues in orange juice/milk versus strawberry juice/milk beverages after HPP treatment. Moreover, HPP resulted as more effective than thermal treatment, being an effective tool to incorporate to food industry in order to reach mycotoxins reductions.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000348', 'D000818', 'D001628', 'D002851', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D005638', 'D000067030', 'D007783', 'D059627', 'D008892', 'D009183', 'D053719', 'D027843']","['Aflatoxins', 'Animals', 'Beverages', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Fruit and Vegetable Juices', 'Lactones', 'Liquid Phase Microextraction', 'Milk', 'Mycotoxins', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vitis']",High Pressure Processing Impact on Alternariol and Aflatoxins of Grape Juice and Fruit Juice-Milk Based Beverages.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205651,2021

Previous human intervention studies identified several biomarkers for dairy foods in blood and urine using non-targeted metabolomics. We evaluated the robustness of these biomarkers in a free-living cohort in the Netherlands using both single- and multi-marker approaches. Plasma and urine from 246 participants (54 ± 13 years) who completed a food frequency questionnaire were analyzed using liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The targeted metabolite panel included 37 previously-identified candidate biomarkers of milk, cheese, and/or yoghurt consumption. Associations between biomarkers and energy-adjusted dairy food intakes were assessed by a 'single-marker' generalized linear model, and stepwise regression was used to select the best 'multi-marker' panel. Multi-marker models that also accounted for common covariates better captured the subtle differences for milk (urinary galactose, galactitol; sex, body mass index, age) and cheese (plasma pentadecanoic acid, isoleucine, glutamic acid) over single-marker models. No significant associations were observed for yogurt. Further examination of other facets of validity of these biomarkers may improve estimates of dairy food intake in conjunction with self-reported methods, and help reach a clearer consensus on their health impacts.",Metabolites,[],[],Evaluating the Robustness of Biomarkers of Dairy Food Intake in a Free-Living Population Using Single- and Multi-Marker Approaches.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204298,2021

Currently, state-of-the-art tests for detecting AFM1 in milk include chromatographic systems and enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays. Although these tests provide fair accuracy and sensitivity, they require trained laboratory personnel, expensive infrastructure, and many hours to produce final results. Optical sensors leveraging spectroscopy have a tremendous potential of providing an accurate, real-time, and specialist-free AFM1 detector. Despite this, AFM1 sensing demonstrations using optical spectroscopy are still immature. Here, we demonstrate an optical sensor that employs the principle of cavity attenuated phase shift spectroscopy in optical fiber cavities for rapid AFM1 detection in aqueous solutions at 1550 nm. The sensor constitutes a cavity built by two fiber Bragg gratings. We splice a tapered fiber of < 10 μm waist inside the cavity as a sensing head. For ensuring specific binding of AFM1 in a solution, the tapered fiber is functionalized with DNA aptamers followed by validation of the conjugation via FTIR, TGA, and EDX analyses. We then detect AFM1 in a solution by measuring the phase shift between a sinusoidally modulated laser input and the sensor output at resonant frequencies of the cavity. Our results show that the sensor has the detection limit of 20 ng/L (20 ppt), which is well below both the U.S. and the European safety regulations.

Their trace-level analysis is still too time- and cost-intensive to be adequately covered in routine analysis. Thus, a new high-throughput planar solid-phase extraction method has been developed for rapid screening of 66 antibiotics. Via simple clicks on the image, the autoTLC-MS interface automatically eluted the target analyte zones directly into an orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer operated in the variable data-independent acquisition mode. Muscle tissue, cow milk and chicken eggs were analyzed regarding nine different antibiotic classes, including sulfonamides, diaminopyrimidines, lincosamides, pleuromutilins, macrolides, cephalosporins, penicillins, amphenicols and nitroimidazoles. The planar clean-up took 7 min per sample, which is 5-fold faster than the routine state-of-the-art.

Fractions (F ≤3 kDa) obtained from cell-free supernatants of Lb. fermentum strains J23 and J32 were further fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column. Antimicrobial activities of F ≤3 kDa and bacteriocin-containing fractions (BCF), obtained from fractionation of F ≤3 kDa against 4 indicator microorganisms, were determined by the disk diffusion method and growth inhibition in milk. Subsequently, isolated BCF were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that BCF presented antimicrobial activity against the 4 indicator microorganisms tested. For J23, one of the fractions (F3) presented the highest activity against Escherichia coli and was also inhibitory against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Salmonella Choleraesuis. Similarly, fractions F3 and F4 produced by J32 presented antimicrobial activity against all indicator microorganisms. Furthermore, generation time and growth rate showed that F3 from J23 presented significantly higher antimicrobial activity against the 4 indicator microorganisms (2 gram-positive and 2 gram-negative) when inoculated in milk compared with F3 from J32. Interestingly, this fraction presented a broader antimicrobial spectrum in milk than nisin (control). Reversed-phase HPLC tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of several peptides in BCF; however, F3 from J23 that was the most active fraction of all presented only 1 bacteriocin. The chemical characterization of this bacteriocin suggested that it was a novel peptide with 10 hydrophobic AA residues in its sequence and a molecular weight of 2,056 Da.

Off-flavors generated during 90-d ambient storage (25 °C) of PDY from reconstituted skim milk were investigated by sensory evaluation, volatile component analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-olfactometry. Rancid off-flavor was induced by increased fatty acid concentration due to fat decomposition by heat-stable lipase. Masking of off-flavors was inhibited by degradation of diacetyl, which originally contributed to yogurt-like flavors. Maillard reaction particular to ambient storage of PDY resulted in changes in the furaneol and sotolon levels, which may be involved in enhancement of off-flavors. Finally, our findings indicated that production of 4-vinylguaiacol may be involved in off-flavor development.

Moreover, the determination with liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is difficult owing to the influence of impurities. Sake usually does not contain lipids or proteins ; therefore, its analysis can be simplified by omitting the co-precipitation steps to remove them. In the present study, for cheese, the amount of sodium hydroxide solution that causes suspension was reduced, and the influence of residues was removed by adjusting the volume after suction filtration. Whereas, sake was diluted with water and centrifuged. Furthermore, solid-phase extraction (SPE) method using cartridge containing carbon molecular sieve to remove the influence of impurities on the chromatogram was successfully established. The recoveries of the nitrate ions were good outcomes of 91.3-99.6% (CV 0.9-4.5%) (n=5). The analysis range was 0.010-0.20 g/kg for cheese, 0.010-0.20 g/L for milk, and 0.010-0.10 g/kg for sake.

Pasteurization efficiency was certified by alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase enzyme tests and cheese samples were evaluated for pH, moisture and total protein and fat content. MON residues were determined by LC-MS/MS in the following steps: raw milk, heat-treated milk, whey and cheese. No significant degradation of MON due to heat treatment was observed, suggesting that the drug is resistant to high temperatures. Moreover, the residue levels quantified in cheese and whey demonstrated a concentration of this antibiotic in the curd by about 5-fold, with a small amount of MON being lost during draining. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) considering the physicochemical parameters evaluated in cheese samples. Fermentation was also not affected by the presence of the drug.

33184759,"The toxic protein of ricin has drawn wide attention in recent years as a potential bioterrorism agent due to its high toxicity and wide availability. For the verification of the potential anti-terrorism activities, it is urgent for the quantification of ricin in food-related matrices. Here, a novel strategy of trypsin/Glu-C tandem digestion was introduced for quantitative detection of ricin marker peptides in several beverage matrices using isotope-labeled internal standard (IS)-mass spectrometry. The ricin in beverages was captured and enriched by biotinylated anti-ricin polyclonal antibodies conjugated to streptavidin magnetic beads. The purified ricin was cleaved using the developed trypsin/Glu-C tandem digestion method and then quantitatively detected by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) with isotope-labeled T7A and TG11B selected as IS. The use of trypsin/Glu-C digestion allows shorter peptides, which are more suitable for MS detection, to be obtained than the use of single trypsin digestion. Under the optimized tandem digestion condition, except for T7A in the A-chain, two resulting specific peptides of TG13A, TG28A from the A-chain and two of TG11B, TG33B from the B-chain were chosen as novel marker peptides with high MS response. The uniqueness of the selected marker peptides allows for unambiguous identification of ricin among its homologous proteins in a single run. The MS response of the four novel marker peptides is increased by more than 10 times compared with that of individual corresponding tryptic peptides. Both the marker peptides of A-chain T7A and B-chain TG11B were selected as quantitative peptides based on the highest MS response among the marker peptides from their individual chains. The limit of detection (LOD) of ricin is 0.1 ng/mL in PBS and 0.5 ng/mL in either milk or orange juice. The linear range of calibration curves for ricin were 0.5-300 ng/mL in PBS, 1.0-400 ng/mL in milk, and 1.0-250 ng/mL in orange juice. The method accuracy ranged between 82.6 and 101.8% for PBS, 88.9-105.2% for milk, and 95.3-118.7% for orange juice. The intra-day and inter-day precision had relative standard deviations (%RSD) of 0.3-9.4%, 0.7-8.9%, and 0.2-6.9% in the three matrices respectively. Furthermore, whether T7A or TG11B is used as a quantitative peptide, the quantitative results of ricin are consistent.

Here, we propose that oxylipins, a group of oxidised metabolites derived from various polyunsaturated fatty acids, could be promising biomarkers for organic milk assessment because their biosynthesis is modulated by both precursor fatty acid availability and physiological or pathological status. Thus, we determined 31 fatty acids, 53 triacylglycerols and 37 oxylipins in one hundred commercial UHT milks by chromatographic methods coupled to mass spectrometry. Of these, 52 milks were conventional (34 whole milk, 11 semi-skimmed milk and 7 skimmed milk) and 48 were organic (31 whole milk, 11 semi-skimmed milk and 6 skimmed milk). Several oxylipins (8-HEPE, 5-HEPE, 11-HEPE, 9-HEPE, 18-HEPE, 9-HOTrE, 13-HOTrE, 12,13-DiHODE and 15,16-DiHODE) could distinguish between organic and conventional milks.

Even though the dietary daily intake of this class of compounds it has been recently estimated as not negligible, to date, no studies specifically have investigated their presence in human plasma after consumption of CPFA-rich sources. Therefore, the aims of this study were (i) to test CPFAs concentration in human plasma, thus demonstrating their in vivo bioaccessibility and potential bioavailability, (ii) to investigate a dose-response relationship between medium term chronic intake of CPFAs-rich foods and both CPFAs and plasma total fatty acid profiles in healthy subjects. Ten healthy normal weight adults were enrolled for conducting an in vivo study.

33138259,"Tryptophan (TRP) is an essential amino acid which cannot be synthesized by humans and animals, but has to be supplied by exogenous sources, notably through the diet. The bulk of dietary TRP flows into the synthesis of body's proteins, but the TRP metabolism also involves several biochemical reactions (i.e., serotonin and kynurenine pathways). Defects in the TRP transport mechanism or catabolism are related to a large number of clinical abnormalities. Therefore, dietary TRP intake is necessary not only for the body's growth but also for most of the body's metabolic functions. Among protein-based foods, milk proteins provide a relatively high amount of TRP. In this paper, a rapid chromatographic method for TRP determination in yoghurt, by ultra high performance liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column with fluorescence detection (280 nm Ex; 360 nm Em), is provided. A linear gradient elution of acetonitrile in water allowed TRP analysis in 8.0 min. The limit of detection and limit of quantification of the method were 0.011 ng/µL and 0.029 ng/µL, respectively, using 5-methyl-l-tryptophan as the internal standard.

Therefore, estimating the exposure to chemicals migrating from packaging is required. In this study, a novel approach based on a total diet study (TDS)-like investigation to evaluate the exposure to chemicals transferred from the packaging was presented. The proposed methodology involved a non-targeted gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method to identify potential migrants and the determination of the migrants in composite food samples. The method was applied to evaluate the dietary exposure to chemicals from food packaging materials used for milk and dairy products in the Spanish child and adolescent populations. Several migrants identified in packaging materials were selected to determine their concentration in composite food samples. These chemicals included diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), bis(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), benzophenone (BP), 1,3-diphenylpropane (1,3-DPP), and bis(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT). The method exhibited a good sensitivity (limit of detection, LOD ≤ 0.05 µg/g) and a satisfactory recovery (78.4-124%). Finally, the exposure was estimated using the Spanish national dietary survey ENALIA. Phthalates DBP and DEHP showed the highest mean exposure, ranging from 2.42 (10-17 years)-4.40 (12-35 months) and 1.35 (10-17 years)-4.07 (12-35 months) µg/kg bw/day for DBP and DEHP, respectively.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Dietary Exposure Estimation to Chemicals Transferred from Milk and Dairy Products Packaging Materials in Spanish Child and Adolescent Population.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33121003,2020

Thus, the aim of this paper is to determine the influence of lactation stage on the ewes' milk quality in western Croatia by considering concentrations of mercury and other elements in ewes' milk. The research was conducted on 36 Travnik pramenka sheep during different lactation stages. The digested milk samples were analysed with continuous flow hydride generation technique by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Samples were taken during 40th, 80th and 120th d of lactation. Yield and quality of ewes' milk was within lactation curve. As lactation progressed, significantly lower concentrations of Hg (on 80th d compared to 40th d) and of Cd (120th d compared to 80th d) were noted, and Hg on 120th d was below the detection limit. Concentrations of Ca and Cu were lower on the 120th d compared to 40th d, while P, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Se were lower on the 80th and 120th d compared to the 40th d.

Cheese quality parameters and proximate composition were not affected by the dietary treatment, whereas the antioxidant status and oxidative stability of cheese were positively affected. Polyphenol analyses in cheese were performed through liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The concentration of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, and their sulphate metabolites, were higher in cheese from supplemented sheep.

Using a combination of dynamic headspace vacuum transfer In Trap extraction and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we measured volatile compounds (the ""volatilome"") in plasma and urine samples from a randomized controlled crossover intervention study in which 11 healthy subjects ingested milk, cheese, or a soy-based drink. More than 2000 volatile compounds were detected in plasma, while 1260 compounds were detected in urine samples. A postprandial response in plasma was confirmed for 697 features. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified four molecules in plasma and 31 molecules in urine samples differentiating the ingestion of the foods, of which three metabolites in plasma and nine in urine were specific to the dairy products. Among these molecules, heptan-2-one, 3,5-dimethyloctan-2-one, and undecan-2-one in plasma and 3-ethylphenol, heptan-2-one, 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate, and 9-decenoic acid were highly discriminative for dairy or cheese intake.

32866515,"Food allergy affects up to 6% of Europeans. Allergen identification is important for the risk assessment and management of the inadvertent presence of allergens in foods. The VITAL® initiative for voluntary incidental trace allergen labeling suggests protein reference doses, based on clinical reactivity in food challenge studies, at or below which voluntary labelling is unnecessary. Here, we investigated if current analytical methodology could verify the published VITAL® 2.0 doses, that were available during this analysis, in serving sizes between 5 and 500 g. Available data on published and commercial ELISA, PCR and mass spectrometry methods, especially for the detection of peanuts, soy, hazelnut, wheat, cow's milk and hen's egg were reviewed in detail. Limit of detection, quantitative capability, matrix compatibility, and specificity were assessed. Implications by the recently published VITAL® 3.0 doses were also considered. We conclude that available analytical methods are capable of reasonably robust detection of peanut, soy, hazelnut and wheat allergens for levels at or below the VITAL® 2.0 and also 3.0 doses, with some methods even capable of achieving this in a large 500 g serving size. Cow's milk and hen's egg are more problematic, largely due to matrix/processing incompatibility.

32854310,"Food allergies are a global food challenge. For correct food labelling, the detection and quantification of allergens are necessary. However, novel product formulations and industrial processes produce new scenarios, which require much more technological developments. For this purpose, OMICS technologies, especially proteomics, seemed to be relevant in this context. This review summarises the current knowledge and studies that used proteomics to study food allergens. In the case of the allergenic proteins, a wide variety of isoforms, post-translational modifications and other structural changes during food processing can increase or decrease the allergenicity. Most of the plant-based food allergens are proteins with biological functions involved in storage, structure, and plant defence. The allergenicity of these proteins could be increased by the presence of heavy metals, air pollution, and pesticides. Targeted proteomics like selected/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) have been very useful, especially in the case of gluten from wheat, rye and barley, and allergens from lentil, soy, and fruit. Conventional 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting have been further widely used. For animal-based food allergens, the widely used technologies are 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF, and more recently LC-MS/MS, which is becoming useful to assess egg, fish, or milk allergens. The detection and quantification of allergenic proteins using mass spectrometry-based proteomics are promising and would contribute to greater accuracy, therefore improving consumer information.",Biology,[],[],Current Trends in Proteomic Advances for Food Allergen Analysis.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854310,2020

32719085,"Commercial formulations of 29 commonly used herbal supplements (HSs) and grapefruit juice were evaluated for drug interaction potential via quantification of their CYP3A inhibitory potential in two in vitro experimental models of human small intestine, cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa (CHIM), and cryopreserved human enterocytes (CHEs). Two CYP3A substrates were used-in the studies with CHIM, CYP3A activity was quantified via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry quantification of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, whereas in CHE, luciferin-IPA metabolism to luciferin was quantified by luminescence. Upon treatment of CHIM with the estimated lumen concentration of the HS upon each oral administration (manufacturers' recommended dosage dissolved in 200 ml of culture medium), >80% CYP3A inhibition was observed for green tea extract, St. John's wort, valerian root, horehound, and grapefruit juice. Less than 50% inhibition was observed for fenugreek, aloe vera, guarana, soy isoflavone, maca, echinacea, spirulina, evening primrose, milk thistle, cranberry, red yeast rice, rhodiola, ginkgo biloba, turmeric, curcumin, white kidney bean, garlic, cinnamon, saw palmetto berries, panax ginseng, black elderberry, wheat grass juice, flaxseed oil, black cohosh, and ginger root. The results were confirmed in a a dose-response study with HSs obtained from three suppliers for the four inhibitory HSs (green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, valerian root) and three representative noninhibitory HSs (black cohosh, black elderberry, echinacea). Similar results were obtained with the inhibitory HSs in CHE. The results illustrate that CHIM and CHE represent physiologically relevant in vitro experimental models for the evaluation of drug interaction potential of herbal supplements. Based on the results, green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, and valerian root may cause drug interactions with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates, as was observed for grapefruit juice. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In vitro evaluation of 29 popular herbal supplements in cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa identified green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, and valerian root to have CYP3A inhibitory potential similar to that for grapefruit juice, suggesting their potential to have clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates.

The objective of this study was to observe the effect of anthocyanins from purple corn pigment on the oxidation of UFA in milk. Milk samples were randomly divided into 2 groups: (1) the control (without purple corn pigment) and (2) treatment (0.3% purple corn pigment), using a completely randomized design. The milk samples were placed into plastic tubes and stored at 4°C for a period of 0, 1, 3, and 7 d. Individual anthocyanin composition and UFA were detected by HPLC-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. The results indicated that pelargonidin (0.258 vs. 0.054 µg/mL), cyanidin (5.550 vs. 1.808 µg/mL), petunidin (0.464 vs. 0.107 µg/mL), delphinidin (2.061 vs. 0.123 µg/mL), and total anthocyanin (8.332 vs. 2.091 µg/mL) significantly decreased in response to increasing storage day.

The odds ratio (OR) was calculated between the concentration of pesticides (higher and/or lower than median) and the exposure variable (high consumption). The results indicated low median concentrations of HCB, β - HCH, op'DDT and pp'DDT, whose fluctuations and trends between different frequencies of food consumption were not significant. pp'DDE and Σ - DDT values according to the increase in consumption of fish were significantly increased.

Lactating women (N = 74) provided samples of foods stored and available at their households between April-August/2018, totaling 184 samples. Mycotoxins were determined in food samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. According to findings, 20% (n = 36) of all food samples were contaminated with AFs at median concentrations ranging from 9.2 to 18.5 µg/kg, while OTA was detected only in three samples (rice, bread and pasta) at concentrations of 22.3, 23.8 and 48.7 µg/kg, respectively.

Thirty-six Friesian cows, balanced for parity, milk production, and days in milk, were randomly assigned to four groups. The control group (CG) was fed with a conventional feeding strategy, while the three remaining groups received a diet enriched with three different trace elements, respectively zinc (ZG), selenium (SG), and iodine (IG). At the end of the experimental period, samples of milk were collected and used to produce Caciocavallo cheese from each experimental group. Cheese samples were then analyzed after 7 and 120 days from the cheese making in order to obtain information on chemical composition and extent of the proteolytic process, evaluated through the electrophoretic analysis of caseins and the determination of volatiles profile. Both milk and cheese samples were richer in the amount of the microelement respectively used for the integration of the cattle's diet. The zymographic approach was helpful in evaluating, in milk, the proteolytic function performed by endogenous metalloenzymes specifically able to degrade gelatin and casein; this evaluation did not highlight significant differences among the analyzed samples. In cheese, the electrophoretic analysis in reducing and denaturing condition showed the marked ability of β-casein to resist the proteolytic action during ripening, whereas the dietary selenium supplementation was shown to perform a protective action against the degradation of S1 and S2 isoforms of α-casein. The analysis of the volatile profile evidenced the presence of compounds associated with proteolysis of phenylalanine and leucine. This approach showed that selenium was able to negatively influence the biochemical processes that lead to the formation of 3-methyl butanol, although the identification of the specific mechanism needs further investigation.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000821', 'D000818', 'D002364', 'D002417', 'D002611', 'D002849', 'D004032', 'D019587', 'D004591', 'D005260', 'D018093', 'D007455', 'D007774', 'D007930', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D000439', 'D010649', 'D011247', 'D020033', 'D059748', 'D012643', 'D055549', 'D015032']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Caseins', 'Cattle', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Gelatinases', 'Iodine', 'Lactation', 'Leucine', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Pentanols', 'Phenylalanine', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteolysis', 'Selenium', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Zinc']",Proteolytic Volatile Profile and Electrophoretic Analysis of Casein Composition in Milk and Cheese Derived from Mironutrient-Fed Cows.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397653,2021

The main objective of this study was to determine the real contamination of selected areas of Slovakia compared with existing Environmental regionalization of the Slovak Republic (SR) created by the Ministry of the Environment SR. Another aim of this study was to determine the content of essential and toxic metals in feed and milk of dairy cows on selected farms in Slovakia referred to the suitability of the use of milk from these areas to other food processing. This article deals with the analysis of the content of selected elements in feed and milk of dairy cows in the area of Novoť (Northern Slovakia; area with undisturbed environment) and Čečejovce (Eastern Slovakia; highly disturbed environment). Eleven elements have been analyzed (essential elements: calcium, zinc, magnesium, selenium, iron, copper; toxic elements: arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, nickel). Samples of feed and milk were collected five times during the spring season and five times during the autumn season in 2016. Analysis of samples was performed in Eurofins Bel/Novamann (Nové Zámky, Slovak Republic). Analyses were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy and atomic emission spectrometry. The obtained values of the individual elements in the feed and milk were evaluated by Student's t test. Significantly higher contents of essential elements Ca, Zn, Fe, Mg, and Cu were found in the feed of dairy cows in Čečejovce (P < 0.001). Significantly higher (P < 0.001) As and Ni content in feed in Čečejovce in autumn season was also recorded. However, the content of these elements in feed did not affect their milk content. The content of Ca, Zn, and Mg in milk was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in Novoť in both investigated seasons. Some essential elements and toxic elements in feed and milk were below the LOQ (limit of quantification). Reduced content of Ca and Zn in milk in both farms compared with optimal limits, decreased Ca and Mg content in feed in Novoť, and a significant increase of Ca and Mg in feed in Čečejovce in autumn season were found.

This is the case for bovine milk where addition of non-dairy milks such as vegetables (e.g., soya or coconut) has become a common source of adulteration and fraud. Conventionally, gas chromatography techniques are used to detect key lipids (e.g., triacylglycerols) has an effective read-out of assessing milks origins and to detect foreign milks in bovine milks. However, such approach requires several sample preparation steps and a dedicated laboratory environment, precluding a high throughput process. To cope with this need, here, we aimed to develop a novel and simple method without organic solvent extractions for the detection of bovine and non-dairy milks based on lipids fingerprint by routine MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). The optimized method relies on the simple dilution of milks in water followed by MALDI-TOF MS analyses in the positive linear ion mode and using a matrix consisting of a 9:1 mixture of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid (super-DHB) solubilized at 10 mg/mL in 70% ethanol.

32183410,"This paper aimed to assess the effects of feeding fresh forage on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of buffalo milk and mozzarella cheese. Sixteen lactating buffaloes were equally allotted into two groups fed diets containing (experimental (Exp) group) or not (control (Ctl) group) 20 kg/d of fresh sorghum. Milk from the groups was separately collected and transformed in the traditional 'Mozzarella di Bufala Campana' Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO). Three batches of mozzarella were produced for each diet and they were analyzed, along with the two bulks of milk, for VOC composition, by using solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) coupled with gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The use of fresh forage increased the levels of long chain fatty acids along with the contents of aldehydes, and this could be responsible for an increase in green notes of milk. The use of the Ctl diet, containing a higher proportion of silage, increased the ketones, acids, and esters, which are compounds that could raise the cheese and fruity notes of milk. The mozzarella was less affected by the dietary treatment than milk. The use of fresh forage (sorghum) enhanced the green notes of milk and induced a few changes in the VOC profile of the typical PDO Mozzarella di Bufala Campana cheese, that were nonetheless detectable by sensory analysis. The low level found for butanoic acid, 2,3-pentanedione, and propyl acetate in mozzarella cheese obtained with fresh forage diet can lead to perceive less the olfactory notes of cheese, cream, and fruit.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000818', 'D002020', 'D002611', 'D004032', 'D004952', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D007774', 'D008892', 'D012820', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Buffaloes', 'Cheese', 'Diet', 'Esters', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Lactation', 'Milk', 'Silage', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Effects of Inclusion of Fresh Forage in the Diet for Lactating Buffaloes on Volatile Organic Compounds of Milk and Mozzarella Cheese.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000494']","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'methods', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32183410,2020

32122598,"Non-S. aureus staphylococci (NAS) are the most frequently isolated pathogens from bovine milk and can cause intramammary infections (IMI). They can also be found in teat canals, on bovine skin and in cows' environment, which may lead to unnoticed contamination of milk samples. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of NAS species as mastitis-causing pathogens or contaminants, and to identify possible differences between NAS species. A longitudinal study was conducted with consecutive milk sampling in five German dairy herds. Species identification was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Infections were distinguished from contaminations using two different definitions based on the repeated detection of an NAS species. Of 15 NAS species found, eight and ten, respectively, were associated with an IMI. Staphylococcus simulans and S. chromogenes were associated with IMI in more than 90 % of the findings. S. warneri, S. xylosus, S. microti, S. haemolyticus, and S. succinus seem to be frequent causes of IMI as well as contaminants. If a species-differentiation is available after cultivating NAS, the findings should be interpreted in consideration of the observations made in this study, whether it is more likely a question of a contaminant or a cause of intramammary infection.

The European legislation in place issues the mandatory labelling of fourteen allergenic ingredients whenever used in different food formulations. Among these, six allergenic ingredients, namely milk, egg, peanut, soybean, hazelnut and almond, can be prioritized in light of their higher occurrence in food recalls for undeclared presence with serious risk decision. In this work, we described the results of a comprehensive evaluation of the current literature on MS-based allergen detection aiming at collecting all available information about proteins and peptide markers validated in independent studies for the six allergenic ingredients of interest. The main features of the targeted proteins were commented reviewing all details available about known isoforms and sequence homology particularly in plant-derived allergens.

Five long-time-ripened cheeses made from different milk types were analysed for histamine producing bacterial isolates. The ability of the isolates to produce histamine was tested by incubation at 37 °C for five days in a restricted media with a pH indicator. Changes in the amino-compound profile were investigated using ultra performance liquid chromatography. Only eight of 106 isolates were able to produce compounds raising the pH and seven of those were confirmed to be histamine producers. Despite the fact that all isolates were obtained from the same vintage Danish Gouda cheese, made from raw cow milk, the amino-compound profile as well as the response to different environmental conditions diverged between the isolates. Rep-PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to further characterize the isolates. Pediococcus pentosaceus was for the first time reported to be a histamine producer in cheese. The presence of the histidine decarboxylase gene (hdcA) was confirmed by PCR amplification of the histidine decarboxylase gene in four of the isolates. The results indicate that evaluating the presence and concentration of histamine is not only a relevant parameter to evaluate quality and safety, but is also an important tool to classify histamine producers in cheese.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D001419', 'D002611', 'D005516', 'D006632']","['Bacteria', 'Cheese', 'Food Microbiology', 'Histamine']",Histamine forming behaviour of bacterial isolates from aged cheese.,"['Q000145', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000378']","['classification', 'microbiology', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31955783,2021

The characterization of the conjugates by TNBS, SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and circular dichroism analysis confirmed the formation of conjugates. SFAG was found to have less tendency for the formation of grafted WPI than SFM, which could be attributed to both the polysaccharide composition and/or a higher molecular weight. Ultimately, the emulsions stabilized by conjugates (pH 5.0 and 6.5) remained homogenous with no droplet size variation after heating, indicating that the conjugation of WPI to SFAG and SFM substantially improved its heat stability.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D002942', 'D019597', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D015416', 'D000068181', 'D012116', 'D000067816']","['Circular Dichroism', 'Flax', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Maillard Reaction', 'Prunus dulcis', 'Resins, Plant', 'Whey Proteins']",Maillard conjugation of whey protein isolate with water-soluble fraction of almond gum or flaxseed mucilage by dry heat treatment.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31955753,2021

The cheeses were manufactured at the same dairy by fermentation by autochthonous natural whey starter (traditional backslopping method) and direct acidification with citric acid (the most used industrial technology). Three cheesemaking trials were performed from February to June using raw milk from a single farm. The mozzarella samples were subjected to assessment of the chemical, microbiological, and sensory characteristics and to VOC analysis by headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The relevant microbiological differences found between the 2 types of products were reflected in different sensory and VOC profiles. The cheeses were clearly discriminated by the panel, and traditional mozzarella had higher intensity attributes. The most discriminating descriptors were elasticity, overall odor and taste intensity, sour milk and fruity/vegetable odors, sour taste, and aftertaste. Even though some variability was observed among the trials, the VOC profile of traditional product was always much more complex than that obtained by direct acidification. In both products the carbonyl compounds were the most abundant chemical class, accounting for about 50% of the total. In detail, 51 compounds were identified in the entire set of samples, and their contribution to cheese aroma was roughly estimated by calculating the odor activity values on the basis of the odor thresholds available in the literature. The results allowed hypothesizing that only 12 of them could play a primary role. The most important among the odor-active compounds was 3-methyl-butanal that can both derive from metabolism of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts.

MFH was utilized as food packaging material, equipped with the developed properties. MFH was synthesized with a redox polymerization technique in film form on petri dishes. Mechanical and water resistance properties of MFH were improved by CA and N, N, methylenebisacrylamide, while PE was used to gain antimicrobial, antioxidant and anthocyanin properties. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA), Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) instruments were utilized for characterization of MFH. FTIR revealed the existence of bonding interactions between the functional group of PE and gelatin, carbonyl groups of DMAAm and carboxylic acid groups of CA. TGA results indicate that MFH was stable up to 400 °C. Then the response of total antioxidant and anthocyanin activities leading to the color change in MFH were studied at different pH values. The color change in MFH was monitored even at very small pH changes in the medium. Moreover, antimicrobial activity and stability of MFH were investigated when it was tested in harsh environments and against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus on real samples of whole pasteurized milk and cheese for a 7-day period. It exhibited remarkable antimicrobial activity with pasteurized whole milk and cheese.

Buckwheat fermented milk was made with Lactobacillus plantarum ST-Ⅲ, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Thirty-six males C57BL/6 rats (aged 3 weeks and with 9 to 12 g weight) were subjected to a 2-week adaptive period on a normal diet. After a week of acclimatization, the rats were randomly divided into three groups with 12 rats in each group. The high-fat diet with fermented milk (HFDFM) group received HFD supplemented with fermented milk, and the high-fat diet supplemented with buckwheat fermented milk (HFDBFM) group received HFD plus buckwheat fermented milk. Besides, the gavage dose was 0.4 mL/day. After the feedings, colon levels of cytokines and antioxidant indices of the liver, colon, and duodenum tissues were measured. The composition of intestinal flora of rats and the content of SCFAs were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. Supplementation with buckwheat fermented milk significantly inhibited the increases in lipopolysaccharide levels in colon and antioxidant indexes in the HFD-fed rats. In addition, buckwheat fermented milk could significantly enhance Firmicutes and decrease Bacteroidetes compared to HFDFM. In addition, SCFA concentrations in HFDBFM were higher than other groups. In conclusion, buckwheat fermented milk can alleviate the damage of HFD to intestinal flora of rats. It modulates microbiota composition and SCFA concentrations to balance the intestinal environment, which will benefit to rats' intestinal health.

In addition, to estimate the daily intake of the newborns. Cd concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in 70 human milk samples collected between the 2nd and 5th day postpartum. Accuracy of the analysis was checked by various methods including the use of reference material. A structured questionnaire was filled during the collection of milk reporting data concerning anthropometric, sociodemographic parameters, dietary and cosmetic habits, etc. The median (range) of Cd in human milk was 0.49 μg/L (range 0.013-95.19 μg/L) respectively. In 21 (30%) of 70 samples, Cd levels were higher than the normal reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in BM (< 1 μg/L). Indeed, several factors affect significantly Cd levels in BM of the mothers such as low maternal education level, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, and area of residence. Also, the frequency of consumption of milk and dairy products as well dried fruits and wheat bread and the frequency of use of cosmetic powders. However, the daily intake of cadmium by the newborns was lower than tolerable daily intake of the WHO for 97% of them.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of feeding common hay or silage diets used in commercial farms on the nutritional value of sheep cheese fat. We also monitored the effect of cheese ripening period on the fatty acid profile. Cheeses were produced from milk of sheep fed hay and silage diets from 8 farms, on 4 separate occasions (February, May, August, and November) over a 1-yr period. Eighty-four individual fatty acids were determined and identified by gas chromatography. Ripening time (100 and 180 d) significantly reduced moisture, acidity, and water activity of cheeses but did not affect the fatty acid content. However, hay feeding, compared with silage feeding, led to cheeses with 1.5- and 1.3-fold higher contents of vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid, without detrimental changes in saturated and n-3 (omega-3) fatty acid composition.

31614625,"Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten that is associated with gastrointestinal issues, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption. Gluten is a general name for a class of cereal storage proteins of wheat, barley, and rye that are notably resistant to gastrointestinal digestion. After ingestion, immunogenic peptides are subsequently recognized by T cells in the gastrointestinal tract. The only treatment for CD is a life-long gluten-free diet. As such, it is critical to detect gluten in diverse food types, including those where one would not expect to find gluten. The utility of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using cereal-specific peptide markers to detect gluten in heavily processed food types was assessed. A range of breakfast products, including breakfast cereals, breakfast bars, milk-based breakfast drinks, powdered drinks, and a savory spread, were tested. No gluten was detected by LC-MS in the food products labeled gluten-free, yet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measurement revealed inconsistencies in barley-containing products. In products containing wheat, rye, barley, and oats as labeled ingredients, gluten proteins were readily detected using discovery proteomics. Panels comprising ten cereal-specific peptide markers were analyzed by targeted proteomics, providing evidence that LC-MS could detect and differentiate gluten in complex matrices, including baked goods and milk-based products.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D001315', 'D018554', 'D062408', 'D002853', 'D002523', 'D004797', 'D005504', 'D005983', 'D001467', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D040901', 'D014908']","['Australia', 'Avena', 'Breakfast', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Analysis', 'Glutens', 'Hordeum', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Proteomics', 'Triticum']",Assessing the Utility of Multiplexed Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry for Gluten Detection in Australian Breakfast Food Products.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614625,2020

This study investigated the correlations of heavy metal contents between individual cows' milk, water, silage and soil. The relationships between heavy metal contents in individual cows' milk with milk protein, fat, lactose, solid nonfat (SNF), and total solids (TS) were analysed. Concentrations of Pb, As, Cr, and Cd in milk, silage and water were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Lead, Cr, and Cd in soil were measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), and As was detected by Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry (AFS). One-way non-parametric tests and Spearman correlation analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 software. Levels of Pb and Cd in milk from the unpolluted area were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than those from industrial area. Significantly higher (P < 0.01) As residue was recorded in milk from unpolluted area. Positive correlation of Pb was observed between milk and silage, and As in milk was positively correlated with As in water. Content of As in milk was slightly (r = 0.09) correlated with As in silage, even though strong positive correlation (r = 0.78) was observed between silage and water. Positive correlations were observed for Cr and Cd between milk and silage, as well as milk and soil. Positive correlations were observed in Pb-protein, Cr-protein, and Cd-lactose; other positive correlation coefficients were nearly equal to zero. The results suggest that industrial activities lead to possible Pb and Cd contamination in milk. Drinking water could be the main source of As contamination in cows.

The binding capacity of HxAc, HpAc, LiFo, LiAc, geraniol, and linalool increased in the pH of the medium from 3 to 9. For limonene and myrcene, an unexpected increase in headspace concentration or a ""salting-out"" effect was observed.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SPME method is a technology of dynamic adsorption for flavors. The lowest level of lead be practicably detected in food as low as the practiced concentration of flavors (0.01-0.1 mM) in our study. At low concentrations of flavors, it is close to the actual flavor's concentration of food. In the previous studies, the technology, such as equilibrium dialysis, headspace-gas phase which need higher concentration of flavors (>0.2 mM). The interaction between flavors and protein has a different binding law at high and low concentrations.

For this purpose, two mass spectrometry techniques were used: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time of flight mass spectrometry together with principal component analysis method and liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

This effect is greater than in fresh milk and differs between cheese and yoghurt. However, the molecular components responsible for the effect are not known. We tested the hypothesis that the lipid and/or glyceride profiles of yoghurts and cheeses are distinct from one another and fresh milk. We developed a novel sample preparation technique for high-fat samples that can be used with Direct Infusion-Mass Spectrometry. We found that the lipid and glyceride profiles of cheddars from the UK, Ireland and France, and hard cheeses from Sweden and Italy were similar to one another but distinct from unfermented dairy products. The lipid and glyceride profile of yoghurts was varied and included types that may be similar to fresh milk. Several odd-chain-containing triglycerides were more abundant, while a variety of others were less abundant, in fermented milk samples. Phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were more abundant in cheeses, with evidence that the phosphatidylethanomine profile is re-modelled in a way that reflects the bacterial cell envelope. We concluded that a combination of microorganismal metabolism, concentration of the lipid/glyceride fraction and oxidation during fermentation contribute to the observed lipid profile if fermented dairy foods.

31424292,"Traces of antimicrobials in milk are of great concern for public health. The European Union has established maximum residue limits in milk; these, however, by themselves do not guarantee the absence of drug residues in milk and related products. Currently, very little information is available on the transfer of antibiotic residues from milk to other dairy products and their potential effect on food safety. This work evaluated the presence of antibiotic residues in pasteurized fluid milk and fresh cheeses from goat's milk containing these veterinary drugs at legal safety levels (maximum residue limits) and assessed the safety margin of these dairy products for consumers. Eight antibiotics (amoxicillin, benzylpenicillin, cloxacillin, neomycin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and oxytetracycline) were selected, and three batches of fresh cheese were made from pasteurized goat's milk spiked with each of these drugs. Drug residues in milk and cheese samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The safety margin of goat's milk products was calculated taking into account different age groups (children, teenagers, and adults). Results showed that most antibiotics present in raw milk remained in pasteurized milk and were transferred to cheese to a high extent; retention was above 50% in most cases. The minimum safety margin in pasteurized milk was obtained for enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin for the children's group. For fresh cheese, an elevated safety margin was obtained for all antibiotics and age groups considered. However, the large amounts of antibiotics retained in the cheese might contribute to the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Considering the differences in milk from different species and the great variety of cheeses, it would be advisable to continue the traceability study of antibiotics in order to increase the safety margin of dairy products.",Journal of food protection,"['D000818', 'D000900', 'D002611', 'D059022', 'D006041', 'D006801', 'D008892', 'D018570']","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Cheese', 'Food Safety', 'Goats', 'Humans', 'Milk', 'Risk Assessment']",Food Safety Margin Assessment of Antibiotics: Pasteurized Goat's Milk and Fresh Cheese.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424292,2020

Contamination of livestock feed is a significant risk factor, especially for pigs that are highly susceptible to the toxic effects of deoxynivalenol. In this study, validated ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (U-HPLC) combined with a HR-Orbitrap-MS analysis method is described for the identification and quantitative determination of the mycotoxin compounds (DON and deepoxy-deoxynivalenol (DOM-1)) in pig colostrum (milk) and serum. Pre-treatment of the samples involved a deproteinisation step with methanol followed by a purification step by solid phase extraction (HLB cartridges). The chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column with 1.7 μm-particle size using a water-methanol mobile phase. Detection of analytes was achieved on the tandem hybrid mass spectrometer Q Exactive, with a heated electrospray ionisation probe measured in positive mode (H-ESI+). For the confirmation of identification, a mass spectrometer was utilized in the full scan mode with resolving power (PR) = 140,000 (FWHM) and for quantification analysis, it was utilized in the parallel reaction monitoring mode (PRM). The method has been fully validated according to the requirements of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC for confirmatory analyses, plus the addition of a mass accuracy (MA) parameter. For the confirmation of the presence of these analytes in pig colostrum and serum, matching of the retention time with mass accuracy for the precursor ion from MS and product ions from MS/MS was used.

One technique to study whether foods contain allergens is targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) employing scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). However, the applicability of a single MRM method to many commercial foods is unknown as complex and heterogeneous interferences derived from the unique composition of each food matrix can hinder quantification of trace amounts of allergen contamination. We developed a freely available, open source software package MAtrix-Dependent Interference Correction (MADIC) to identify interference and applied it with a method targeting 14 allergens. Among 84 unique food products, we found patterns of allergen contamination such as wheat in grains, milk in chocolate-containing products, and soy in breads and corn flours. We also found additional instances of contamination in products with and without PAL as well as highly variable soy content in foods containing only soybean oil and/or soy lecithin.

31304276,"Peptidomics and glycomics are recently established disciplines enabling researchers to characterize functional characteristics of foods at a molecular level. Milk-derived bioactive peptides and oligosaccharides have garnered both scientific and commercial interest because they possess unique functional properties, such as anti-hypertensive, immunomodulatory and prebiotic activities; therefore, the objective of this work was to employ peptidomic and glycomic tools to identify and measure relative and absolute quantities of peptides and oligosaccharides in widely consumed dairy products. Specifically, we identified up to 2117 unique peptides in 10 commercial dairy products, which together represent the most comprehensive peptidomic profiling of dairy milk in the literature to date. The quantity of peptides, measured by ion-exchange chromatography, varied between 60 and 130 mg/L among the same set of dairy products, which the majority originated from caseins, and the remaining from whey proteins. A recently published bioactive peptide database was used to identify 66 unique bioactive peptides in the dataset. In addition, 24 unique oligosaccharide compositions were identified in all the samples by nano LC Chip QTOF. Neutral oligosaccharides were the most abundant class in all samples (66-91.3%), followed by acidic (8.6-33.7%), and fucosylated oligosaccharides (0-4.6%). Variation of total oligosaccharide concentration ranged from a high of 65.78 to a low of 24.82 mg/L. Importantly, characterizing bioactive peptides and oligosaccharides in a wider number of dairy products may lead to innovations that go beyond the traditional vision of dairy components used for nutritional purposes but that will rather focus on improving human health.",NPJ science of food,[],[],"Peptidomic and glycomic profiling of commercial dairy products: identification, quantification and potential bioactivities.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304276,2020

The aim of this study was to describe a simple bioanalytical method for quantifying SBN in rat plasma. A simple protein deproteinization procedure with acetonitrile (ACN) was employed for plasma sample preparation. A reversed column and gradient elution of a mobile phase (mixture of phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) and ACN) were used for chromatographic separation. The selectivity, linearity (50-5000 ng/mL), precision, accuracy, recovery, matrix effect, and stability for this method were validated as per the current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. Our method for SBN was applied to a comparative pharmacokinetic study on four different commercial silymarin products. This in vivo rat study demonstrated that product #4 significantly enhanced the relative oral bioavailability of SBN, as compared to product #1-3. Therefore, the bioanalytical method proposed herein could serve as a promising alternative for preclinical pharmacokinetic studies on silymarin products and, by extension, clinical use after partial modification and validation.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000284', 'D000818', 'D002851', 'D008297', 'D017207', 'D012015', 'D000077385', 'D013997']","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Male', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reference Standards', 'Silybin', 'Time Factors']",A Simple HPLC Method for the Quantitative Determination of Silybin in Rat Plasma: Application to a Comparative Pharmacokinetic Study on Commercial Silymarin Products.,"[None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000008', None]","[None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31185663,2019
31139860,"The unintentional presence of even trace amounts of certain foods constitutes a major hazard for those who suffer from food allergies. For many food industries, product and raw ingredient surveillance forms part of their risk assessment procedures. This may require the detection of multiple allergens in a wide variety of matrices. Mass spectrometry offers a possible solution for the quantification of multiple allergens in a single analysis. The capability of MS to quantify many peptides from a complex protein digestion is well known. However, a lack of matrix certified reference materials has made the optimisation of extraction and digestion conditions for multiplexed allergen quantification difficult to assess. Here, we report a systematic study, using preliminary screening followed by a Design of Experiments approach, to find the optimal buffer and digestion conditions for detecting milk and egg protein markers in a model processed food matrix. Five of the most commonly used buffers, two chaotropic reagents and two reducing reagents were assessed for the optimal extraction of multiple protein markers. While the choice of background buffer had little impact, the use of chaotropic and reducing reagents showed significant benefits for the extraction of most proteins. A full factorial design experiment was applied to the parameters shown to have a significant impact on protein recovery. These studies suggest that a single optimal set of extraction conditions enabling the quantitative recovery of all proteins is not easily achieved. Therefore, although MS is capable of the simultaneous quantification of many peptides in a single run, greater consideration of protein extraction is required before these are applied for multiplex allergen quantification in food matrices.

We quantified these elements in breast milk from Norwegian mothers and determined their association with dietary habits, maternal amalgam fillings, and smoking. Breast milk (n = 300) from the Norwegian Human Milk Study (HUMIS) was analyzed using triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, after an acidic decomposition using microwave technique. We used multiple linear regression to examine predictors of Hg and Cd in breast milk, and logistic regression to test predictors of Pb above the quantification limit. The median breast milk concentrations (minimum - maximum) were 0.20 μg Hg/kg (<0.058-0.89), 0.057 μg Cd/kg (0.017-1.2), and <0.67 μg Pb/kg (<0.2-7.5). Cadmium showed no significant relation with any exposure variable investigated. Lead was associated with intake of liver and kidneys from game. For Hg concentration in breast milk, number of amalgam fillings and high fish consumption were significant predictors (p < 0.001). We detected a significant association (p < 0.01) between Hg in breast milk and maternal consumption of Atlantic halibut, lean fish, mussels and scallops and lifetime consumption of crab.

Based on this study, the percentile intervals of chemical elements concentrations in hair were established; values of 25 and 75 percentiles were determined, and they were considered as ""physiological standard."" At the second stage, the elemental composition of hair from the upper part of withers of highly productive Holstein cows during the period of increasing milk yield was analyzed (n = 47). The elemental composition of biological substrates was studied according to 25 indicators, using the methods of atomic emission and mass spectrometry (AES-ICP and MS-ICP). An assessment of productivity parameters of cows depending on the level of toxic elements in hair revealed a negative statistically significant relationship with the level of lead. Lead content in hair was negatively correlated with the yield of fat (r = - 0.50), protein (r = - 0.37), and dry matter (r = - 0.48) in milk. Based on these data, cows were divided into three groups: group I, with Pb concentration in hair 0.0245-0.0449 mg/g, group II-between 0.0495 and 0.141 mg/kg, and in group III-between 0.145 and 0.247 mg/g. It was established that increasing Pb content decreases daily production of milk fat by 18.8 (P ≤ 0.05) and 25.3% (P ≤ 0.05), protein by 9.7 (P ≤ 0.05) and 10.7% (P ≤ 0.05), and dry matter by 8.0 and 13.0% (P ≤ 0.05) in cows. Average daily milk yield, adjusted for 1% of fat, decreased by 19.2 (P ≤ 0.05) and 25.3% (P ≤ 0.05), respectively. As the concentration of lead in hair increased, the content of toxic elements (Al, As, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sn, Sr) increased from 0.07 to 0.235 mmol/kg in group I, in group II from 0.082 to 0.266 mmol/kg, and in group III-from 0.126 to 0.337 mmol/kg.

31029699,"The cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is one of the most important ectoparasites for livestock in tropical and subtropical areas around the world. This tick economically impacts cattle production by reducing weight gain and milk production. Moreover, it is a vector of pathogens causing diseases such as babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Conventional tick control relies mainly on the use of chemical acaricides; however, their intensive use has led to the rapid appearance of resistant tick populations. It is therefore necessary to look for alternative tick control products. In that sense, plant extracts might represent a promising source of new acaricides. Previously, we reported a significant acaricide effect of essential oils from selected plant species. In the present study, we used a mixture design approach to develop phyto-formulations by combining individual essential oils. We produced several mixtures at 10% containing different proportions of individual essential oils (ranging from 0 to 1) from cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), cumin (Cuminum cyminum) and allspice (Pimenta dioica) and tested their acaricidal activity against R. microplus ticks by means of larval packet test (LPT) and adult immersion test (AIT) assays. The optimal mixture predicted against R. microplus was composed of 66%, 17% and 17% of essential oils from C. zeylanicum, C. cyminum and P. dioica, respectively. We generated an estimated response surface contour plot that estimates 80%-100% acaricidal efficacy. In the optimal mixture 34 compounds were identified, which represent 98.65% of the total composition, with cinnamaldehyde (37.77%), β-caryophyllene (13.92%), methyl eugenol (12.27%) and cuminaldehyde (8.99%) being the major components. Next, we developed emulsions by combining the optimal mixture with several surfactants and determined particle size, Zeta potential, stability and bioactivity. Emulsions containing 2% and 5% Tween 20 or Tween 80 remain stable after 14 days at 54 °C. Finally, optimized emulsion retained a high acaricidal activity against larval and adult R. microplus ticks.

In addition, breast milk was sampled from the same lactating mother over a 6-h period at five time points after drinking cow's milk. We aimed to trace the intra-individual variability and to define a time profile of the excretion of dietary peptides into breast milk. Overall, 21 peptides exclusively originating from both bovine caseins and whey proteins with no match within the human milk proteome were identified in the breast milk samples. These peptides were missing in the breast milk obtained from the mother after a prolonged milk- and dairy-free diet (three samples). The time course of cow's milk-derived β-Lg f(125-135) and β-casein f(81-92) in breast milk was determined from the MS ion intensity of the peptide signals. No intact cow's milk gene products were detected by HPLC-MS/MS analysis and Western blotting with anti-β-Lg antibody, but dot-blot analysis confirmed the occurrence of β-Lg fragments in the enriched peptide fraction of breast milk. These data suggest shifting the analytical perspective for the detection of dietary food allergens in breast milk from intact proteins to digested peptide fragments.

In the presence of AFB1, AFB1 aptamer undergoes a conformational switch from single stranded structure to the AFB1/AFB1 aptamer complex upon target binding, which induces the release of TPE-Z/AFB1 aptamer from the surface of GO. Thus, the fluorescence of TPE-Z/AFB1 aptamer is recovered. The assay can be performed by simply mixing TPE-Z, AFB1 aptamer, the GO and the AFB1 samples with a detection limit of 0.25 ng/mL.

Three cheese types with different cultures and the control cheese were produced in duplicate and ripened for 8 months. 86 individual FA were determined by gas chromatography. Ripening time (2, 90, 180 and 240 days) did not have a significant effect (P > .05) on the FA content. However, the presence of both Lactobacillus CLA-producing strains led to a decrease of the saturated FA content and to 1.30, 1.19 and 1.27 times higher levels of vaccenic acid, CLA and omega-3, respectively, when compared to the control cheese. This combination allowed obtaining sheep milk cheeses with a healthier FA content, without appreciable changes on sensory characteristics.

30571131,"This study investigated gastrointestinal drug concentrations of the weakly acidic drug diclofenac when dosed to healthy volunteers after intake of the FDA standard meal. In gastrointestinal aspiration studies, postprandial conditions are usually achieved using liquid or homogenized meals. However, these liquid meals may have a substantially different impact on the gastrointestinal physiology compared to a solid meal. To evaluate the effect of a solid meal on the gastrointestinal behavior of diclofenac, five healthy volunteers were recruited into a clinical study. Twenty minutes prior to diclofenac ingestion (Cataflam, 50 mg of potassium diclofenac), the volunteers were asked to eat a solid meal with the following composition corresponding to the FDA standard meal: 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, 2 toasts, 4 ounces of hash brown potatoes, and 8 ounces of milk. Gastric and duodenal fluids were collected as a function of time, and blood samples were collected to link the gastrointestinal behavior to systemic exposure. In vivo observations were complemented with in vitro research to obtain a mechanistic understanding of diclofenac's intraluminal behavior. Ingestion of the solid meal resulted in intraluminal pH-profiles similar to earlier studies with a liquid meal. However, intraluminal drug disposition differed. In the stomach, a substantial fraction of diclofenac appeared dissolved, despite an unfavorable acidic pH. Successive in vitro tests suggested that the dissolution of diclofenac is higher in the complex gastric medium resulting from FDA standard meal ingestion compared to liquid meal ingestion. Despite the favorable pH and in contrast to a previous study with a liquid meal, significant amounts of non-dissolved diclofenac were observed in the intestine. Further in vitro tests revealed adsorption of dissolved diclofenac molecules to bacon fragments present in the FDA standard meal. This adsorption negatively affected the permeation of diclofenac across a physical barrier, suggesting that in vivo absorption is affected as well. Being the first time a gastrointestinal aspiration study is combined with the administration of a solid meal, the present study demonstrates that the intraluminal behavior of diclofenac (and possibly other drugs) heavily depends on the consistency and composition of the accompanied meal.",Molecular pharmaceutics,"['D002851', 'D004008', 'D004386', 'D005260', 'D018565', 'D005746', 'D041981', 'D064368', 'D006801', 'D007408', 'D008297', 'D019518', 'D012995', 'D013270', 'D053719', 'D014481', 'D014486']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diclofenac', 'Duodenum', 'Female', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Gastric Emptying', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Male', 'Postprandial Period', 'Solubility', 'Stomach', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",Gastric and Duodenal Diclofenac Concentrations in Healthy Volunteers after Intake of the FDA Standard Meal: In Vivo Observations and in Vitro Explorations.,"[None, 'Q000493', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'pharmacokinetics', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30571131,2019

30538962,"Diet represents the primary route for human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA). As endocrine disruptor (ED), BPA has raised concerns about its adverse effects on human health. Therefore, EFSA recommended a tolerable daily intake (t-TDI) of 4 μg/kg bw/day and the EU Regulation n. 2018/213 fixed a specific migration limit (SML) of 0.05 mg/kg for BPA in food from plastic materials intended to come in contact with food. BPA could be present in milk due to environmental contamination, and also as a result of the migration from contact materials used during milking and storage. Considering the widespread consumption of milk and milk products, the contamination of dairy products is a matter of public health concern. The aim of the study was to investigate the BPA contamination levels of raw cow's milk from two farms located in Campania region, Italy. The milk samples (n=22), weekly collected from the cooling tank, were analyzed using liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. In raw milk from both farms, preliminary results showed the occurrence of BPA levels lower than the SML limit, ranging from not detected to 2.34 μg/L.

Twenty-nine of 33 odorants detected in the RAS effluent (RAS odorants) were identified. The detected odorants were classified into 19 odor-description groups. The total odor intensity (charm value, CMV) of all coffee RAS odorants decreased approximately 68% following pH adjustment, whereas the total CMV increased 6% to 7% following ultra-high-temperature sterilization. The total CMV ratio (about 83%) of the milk coffee produced using a new blending-after-sterilization (BAS) process without pH adjustment of the coffee was greater than that (approximately 56%) prepared using a conventional blending-before-sterilization (BBS) process with pH adjustment. In BAS-processed milk coffees, the total CMV ratio (91%) with infusion (INF)-sterilized reconstituted milk (r-milk) was greater than that (83%) of plate (PLT)-sterilized r-milk. Principal component analysis of odor-description CMVs indicated that the effect of coffee pH adjustment on odor characteristics was greater than that of sterilization, that BAS and BBS samples differed, and that BAS milk coffee prepared using INF sterilization was more similar to homemade milk coffee (blending unsterilized coffee without pH adjustment with PLT-sterilized milk) than milk coffee prepared using PLT sterilization. In conclusion, the BAS process using INF sterilization is superior for manufacturing RTD milk coffee that retains odor characteristics similar to targeted homemade milk coffee. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Ready-to-drink milk coffee beverages produced using conventional blending-before-sterilization methods do not retain their original coffee flavor following adjustment of the pH of the coffee during manufacturing. The use of newly developed blending-after-sterilization methods, by contrast, produces ready-to-drink milk coffee with an aroma more similar to that of homemade milk coffee, as demonstrated using an analytical system for characterizing food product aromas.

The EAA content and AA composition of the dietary protein source contribute to the differential muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of different proteins. Lower EAA contents and specific lack of sufficient leucine, lysine, and/or methionine may be responsible for the lower anabolic capacity of plant-based compared with animal-based proteins. We compared EAA contents and AA composition of a large selection of plant-based protein sources with animal-based proteins and human skeletal muscle protein. AA composition of oat, lupin, wheat, hemp, microalgae, soy, brown rice, pea, corn, potato, milk, whey, caseinate, casein, egg, and human skeletal muscle protein were assessed using UPLC-MS/MS. EAA contents of plant-based protein isolates such as oat (21%), lupin (21%), and wheat (22%) were lower than animal-based proteins (whey 43%, milk 39%, casein 34%, and egg 32%) and muscle protein (38%). AA profiles largely differed among plant-based proteins with leucine contents ranging from 5.1% for hemp to 13.5% for corn protein, compared to 9.0% for milk, 7.0% for egg, and 7.6% for muscle protein. Methionine and lysine were typically lower in plant-based proteins (1.0 ± 0.3 and 3.6 ± 0.6%) compared with animal-based proteins (2.5 ± 0.1 and 7.0 ± 0.6%) and muscle protein (2.0 and 7.8%, respectively).

The use of β-CD in food research for reduction of cholesterol is increasing due to its affinity for non-polar molecules such as cholesterol. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using β-CD in cholesterol removal from pasteurized ewe's milk Manchego cheese and evaluate the effect on the main components of the milk, lipids, and flavor characteristics. Approximately 97.6% cholesterol reduction was observed in the cheese that was treated using β-CD. Physicochemical properties (fat, moisture and protein) were not changed by the β-CD treatment, except the soluble nitrogen and non-protein nitrogen that showed slight differences after the treatment. The amount of the different components of the lipid fraction (fatty acids, triglycerides and phospholipids) were similar in cheeses treated and not treated with β-CD. Flavor compound and short chain free fatty acids were not mostly significantly influenced by the effect of the β-CD. β-CD molecules are edible and nontoxic and as a result they can be used safely for cholesterol removal processing in cheese manufacturing.

30025459,"A very sensitive ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantitation of the most common neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and thiacloprid) at trace levels in milk. Using fast and selective liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) starting from 0.5 mL of milk, lowest limits of quantitation (LLOQ) equal or lower than 10 pg/mL for all analytes were achieved. Precision and accuracy were evaluated at four different concentrations (5, 10, 500, and 10000 pg/mL) and ranged between 2 and 16% (RSD) and 77-125%, respectively. Extraction recoveries and matrix effects ranged between 64 and 76% and 88-98%, respectively. The method was applied to measure neonicotinoid levels in a series of conventional and organic Swiss milks as well as in human breast milk and commercial powdered milk. More than 90% of the samples tested positive for at least one neonicotinoid. However, all animal samples were far below the maximum residue limits authorized for human consumption with average total neonicotinoid levels of 16.1 ± 13.1 pg/mL.

The opioids are generally resistant to hydrolyze by proteases, except the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5) enzyme, because of proline amino acid. β-casomorphin (BCM) from milk casein, gluteomorphin (GM) from wheat gluten, and soymorphin (SM) from the soybean β-conglycinin β-subunit are natural substrates of DPPIV because of their amino acid sequences and proline location. In the present study, DPPIV from Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis was purified and characterized by mass spectrometry. Purified DPPIV was added to standard BCM, GM, and SM, and hydrolysis percentages of morphins were measured by HPLC analysis. The results indicated that DPPIV enzyme hydrolyzed food-derived opioids (from 0.1 mM to 2 mM), BCM (33.42% for 2 mM), SM (83.81% for 2 mM), and GM (45.73% for 2 mM) in vitro.

Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by standard methods and separated and identified by gas chromatography. Compared with the Chinese breast milk fatty acid data 10 years ago, SFA and trans fatty acids (TFA) in breast milk decreased, while PUFA increased in the present study. Most SFA (C16:0, C15:0, C14:0), cis-C16:1 and several LC-PUFA (C22:5n-3 and C22:6n-3) were predominantly acylated at the sn-2 position. The cis-C17:1 and C22:6n-3 were distributed equally in three positions of triacylglycerol (TAG). Whereas, TFA, conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), cis-C18:1, C18:2n-6, C18:3n-3 and C20:5n-3 were acylated at the sn-1, 3 positions of TAG in human milk. The composition of fatty acids in breast milk was closely related to the diet of lactating mothers. PUFA in breast milk was negatively correlated with the intake of protein, fat and meat, but positively correlated with the intake of carbohydrates. MUFA of human milk was negatively correlated with the intake of dairy products, eggs, fish and shrimp. SFA in breast milk was positively correlated with the maternal intake of meat.

During the last third of gestation and the whole of lactation, sows were subjected to a control diet (C) or the same diet containing FA1 or FA2 at 0.1% of complete feed content. Colostrum/milk samples were taken at days 1, 14, and 28 of lactation for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. After weaning, the progeny was subjected to a control diet (C) or experimental diets with a sweetener (0.015%) but no other additive (S), or to diets with a sweetener and the additive FA1 (FA1S) or FA2 (FA2S). There was no effect of dietary treatment on sows' feed intake, body weight, or adiposity (P > 0.15 for all), but the sensory characteristics of their colostrum/milk were modified by the diet and diet*time interaction. Limonene concentrations were higher in FA1 samples from PND1 to PND28, whereas carvone and anethole concentrations were higher in FA2 samples from PND1 to PND28. The concentration of these 3 compounds increased with time in the respective groups where they were mostly detected. Menthol concentrations were higher in FA2 samples at PND14 and PND28, but there was no time effect. Overall, cinnamaldehyde was always below the detection range. Piglets born from FA1 and FA2 sows had higher body weight (P = 0.034 at PND160), average daily gain (ADG; P = 0.036 for PND0-160), and average daily feed intake (ADFI; P = 0.006 for PND28-160) than piglets born from C sows. Overall, piglets that were never exposed to FA or only after weaning had lower ADG (P = 0.030 for PND0-160) and ADFI (P = 0.016 for PND28-160) than piglets that were exposed to FA only via the maternal diet, the condition combining both pre- and post-natal exposure being intermediary.

29859692,"Short dry periods and their effects on milk production, reproductive performance, as well as cow and udder health have been widely studied. A dearth of information is available about the consequences of short dry periods on the residue concentrations of dry cow antibiotics in milk after calving. The objective of our study was to determine the residue concentration of a dry cow antibiotic in milk after short dry periods during the colostrum period and early lactation. Quarters of 19 dry cows were treated with an intramammary (IMM) dry cow antibiotic containing 150 mg of cefquinome on d 21, 14, and 7 before calculated calving date. One quarter of each cow did not receive treatment and served as negative control. After calving, quarter foremilk samples were collected twice daily until 21 d and once daily until 36 d after IMM dry cow treatment (i.e., end of withdrawal period). A total of 588 foremilk samples from odd milking numbers were chosen for the determination of the residue concentration of cefquinome using HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry until the residue concentration fell below the limit of quantification (1 ng/g), which occurred at the latest in milking number 37. The dry period length of the treated quarters was categorized in 3 dry period groups ranging from 1 to 7 d (4.8 ± 2.4), 8 to 14 d (11.5 ± 2.3), and 15 to 26 d (19.5 ± 3.3; ±SEM), in dry period group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In dry period group 1, the cefquinome concentration increased after calving until the third milking and decreased considerably until the fifth milking. In dry period group 2, the cefquinome concentration peaked at the second milking and decreased considerably until the fifth milking as well. There was no increase in cefquinome after calving in dry period group 3. Up to the 37th milking, the cefquinome concentration was higher in dry period group 1 than in dry period group 2 and 3. On average, 31.3 ± 1.2, 19.0 ± 1.1, and 6.7 ± 0.8 milkings and 19.4 ± 0.4, 20.6 ± 0.5, and 24.1 ± 0.7 d after treatment were necessary for the concentration of cefquinome to fall below the maximum residue limit (MRL) in dry period group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These results indicate that shorter dry periods lead initially to higher cefquinome residues in milk. The residue concentration after experimental short dry periods still falls below the MRL within the recommended withdrawal period for milk of 36 d after IMM dry cow treatment.

29855510,"Olive oil pomace (OOP) is a bio-waste rich in highly soluble polyphenols. OOP has been proposed as an additive in ruminant feeding to modulate rumen fermentations. Three groups of ewes were fed the following different diets: a control diet and two diets supplemented with OOP, obtained with a two-phase (OOP2) or three-phase (OOP3) olive milling process. Rumen liquor (RL) showed a higher content of 18:3 cis9 cis12 cis15 (α-linolenic acid, α-LNA) with OOP2 inclusion, and of 18:2 cis9 trans11 (rumenic acid, RA) with OOP3 inclusion. The overall composition of the RL microbiota did not differ among treatments. Significant differences, between control and treated groups, were found for six bacterial taxa. In particular, RL microbiota from animals fed OOPs showed a reduction in Anaerovibrio, a lipase-producing bacterium. The decrease in the Anaerovibrio genus may lead to a reduction in lipolysis, thus lowering the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids available for biohydrogenation. Milk from animals fed OOP showed a higher content of 18:1 cis9 (oleic acid, OA) but the α-LNA concentration was increased in milk from animals treated with OOP2 only.

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a reliable and sensitive method to determine the presence of fumonisin B1, aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin B, T-2 toxin, ochratoxin A and zearalenone. A rapid, effective process, which involves microwave-assisted dispersive micro-solid phase extraction (MA-d-μ-SPE), has been proposed for the extraction and detection of 6 mycotoxins in peach seed, milk powder, corn flour and beer sample matrixes, for subsequent analysis by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Several experimental parameters (type of dispersant, concentration of dispersant, vortex time, type of desorption solvent and pH) affecting the extraction efficiency were systematically studied and optimized. The optimum extraction conditions involved immersing 2.5 μg/mL of nano zirconia (as dispersant) in a 5 mL sample solution. After 2 min of extraction by vigorous shaking, the target analytes were desorbed by 100 μL of chloroform at pH 4.5. The results indicated good linearity in the range of 0.0074-3.6 μg/mL (r ≥ 0.9982), low limits of detection (0.0036-0.033 μg/kg for solid samples and 0.0022-0.017 ng/mL for beer), acceptable reproducibility (relative standard deviation (RSD%) 2.08-2.76% for retention time and 3.51-4.59% for peak area, n = 3), and satisfactory spiked recoveries (84.27-104.96%) for studied mycotoxins in sample matrixes, which demonstrated that MA-d-μ-SPE coupled with UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS is a useful tool for analysis of multi-mycotoxin.",Journal of chromatography.

It was important to address this hypothesis, since cheese para-κ-casein could theoretically be used for the assessment of the origin of cheese milk by means of various analytical methods. Feta cheese was manufactured from sheep milk and from four different mixtures of sheep and goat milk in triplicate. The para-κ-casein of Feta samples taken during 120 d of ripening and storage was estimated by means of cation-exchange HPLC and proteolysis was determined in terms of free amino groups. Despite their similarity, sheep and goat para-κ-casein were efficiently separated and the changes of their chromatographic areas indicated that hydrolysis took place during the first stage of ripening. In accordance to the evolution of free amino groups, para-κ-caseins remained stable thereafter. The hydrolysis pattern was not affected by the composition of the cheese milk mixture and after 120 d at least two thirds of the initial quantity remained intact. Considering the efficient separation of sheep and goat para-κ-caseins and their stability during Feta storage, the same method was used for the evaluation of the percentage of goat milk in the cheese milk.

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry screening analyses identified β-carotene, lutein, and β-cryptoxanthin as LMWBs of cow milk, while ergocalciferol was found only in water buffalo milk. Adulterated mozzarellas were prepared in the laboratory and analyzed for the four biomarkers. Combined quantification of β-carotene and ergocalciferol enabled the detection of cow milk with a sensitivity threshold of 5% (w/w).

Over the first week of lactation, few significant differences were observed between the different diet groups, with the dominant changes being clearly linked to lactation period. CE analyses indicated the presence of ten unusually anionic BMOs, which were predicted to be phosphorylated and sulfated species.

29735098,"Isothiocyanates (ITC) play an important role in health promotion and cancer prevention due to their anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancerogenic properties. However, ITC are highly reactive so that a reaction with further food components is very likely. For example, a reaction of ITC with nucleophilic amino acid side chains of proteins such as cysteine and lysine can occur, reducing the bioavailability of indispensable amino acids and protein functions may be altered. Therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the fate of ITC in the food matrix. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction of milk proteins and the ITC benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) forming dithiocarbamates and thioureas in milk and curd. After incubating milk and curd with pure ITC or ITC-containing garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.), proteins were isolated, digested, and analyzed via LC-ESI-MS/MS as amino acid derivatives (""conjugates""). Protein conjugates of AITC and BITC were detected in all samples investigated. Further, the acidic pH value in curd favored the formation of dithiocarbamates over the formation of thioureas. Slightly acidic or neutral conditions like in fresh milk favored the formation of thioureas. The investigations also indicated that AITC shows a higher reactivity and dithiocarbamates are formed preferably, whereas incubation with BITC lead to less protein conjugates and the ratio of thioureas and dithiocarbamates was more balanced. In addition, amino acid modifications were often analyzed with indirect methods like measuring the decline of the amino acid residues. In this study, the modified amino acids were analyzed directly leading to more reliable results concerning the amount of modification.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D002853', 'D005504', 'D005511', 'D006863', 'D017879', 'D031220', 'D008894', 'D021241', 'D053719', 'D013859', 'D013890']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Lepidium sativum', 'Milk Proteins', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Thiocarbamates', 'Thiourea']",Determination of isothiocyanate-protein conjugates in milk and curd after adding garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.).,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'methods', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29735098,2019

In addition, we studied the expression of metC and als genes involved in the production of aroma compounds detected by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).

Samples were analysed at manufacturing and ripening steps, in terms of viability of L. lactis by both traditional plating and direct analysis of RNA by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and in terms of aroma profile by GC-MS. Relatively to RT-qPCR analysis, L. lactis was found viable throughout the whole process of cheesemaking and aging, with final average loads of 3-4 Log CFU/g at 180 days. On the contrary, the microorganism was not detected, in ripened samples, by traditional plating on M17 medium, suggesting its entering in a viable but not cultivable (VBNC) state. The aroma profiles of the cheeses highlighted the presence of volatile compounds related to cheese flavor as acetoin, diacetyl, 2,3-butanediol and dimethyl disulfide, whose presence was partially correlated to metC and als genes expression.

From February 2015 to 2016, 118 samples of raw cow's milk, 14 of fodder and 8 of water in Southwest Iran were collected from farms close to oil fields or related industries. Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) levels were evaluated by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Mean±SE in milk and fodder were 47.0±3.9 and 54.0±6.9μg/kg for Pb, and 4.7±1.0 and 3.5±1.3μg/kg for Cd. No Pb or Cd was detected in water. Most milk samples (82.2%) for Pb were above the permissible limits (20μg/kg). Exposure to Pb and Cd from milk consumption was calculated in two scenarios: mean and maximum exposure for the age range of 2-90years. The intake of an average Iranian adult (25years, 60kg b. w., 0.14kg milk/day) would be 6.6μg Pb and 0.66μg Cd/day (WI of 46.2 and 4.6μg, respectively), well below the risk values proposed by some international organizations, even in the maximum exposure scenario. However, Pb exposure for infants and toddlers may be closer to the risk values, since milk and milk products could be the main contributor to Cd and Pb, and small children consume 2-3 times more food than adults relative to their body weight.

The offer of novel edible oils from herbs, spices and fruit seeds has grown and many of them are used as functional food and dietary supplements but also as feed additives in animal feeding. Poultry meat is recommended.in properly balanced diet and its consumption in Poland has been growing. The objective of present study was to verify if the supplementation of chickens' diet with grape seed oil or pomegranate seed oil influences cholesterol content and fatty acids (FA) profile in their livers. Ross 308 chickens (n = 24) were fed with fodder enriched with grape seed oil (G group) or pomegranate seed oil (P group). Diet of control group (C group) was based on soybean oil. FA analysis in livers as well as cholesterol content was made with gas chromatography. We observed significant increase in fat content when part of soybean oil was replaced by grape seed oil (p = 0.0002). Its highest amount was detected in G group (4.44 ± 1.53%) whereas the lowest in C group (1.73 ± 0.53%). Applied supplementation did not change total cholesterol content. Its content ranged from 233.0 ± 12.2 mg/100 g in G group to 234.6 ± 29.7 mg1100 g in C group. However, chickens' diet modification with grape seed oil and pomegranate seed oil influenced the FA profile in livers. We detected the presence of punicic acid (cis-9, trans-11, cis-13 C18:3, PA) in livers of chicken fed with pomegranate seed oil. Pomegranate seed oil is one of natural sources of conjugated linolenic acids (CLnA), which predominate in this oil (PA >70% of all FA). However, in livers PA constituted only 0.90 ± 0.10% of all fatty acids. Furthermore, we detected substantial amounts of rumenic acid (cis-9, trans-11 C18:2, RA) - the major isomer of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). Its natural sources in diet are meat and milk of ruminants, but incorporation of pomegranate seed oil into chickens' diet caused a significant increase of its share in fatty acids pool in their livers (3.73 ? 0.79% in P group in relation to 0.08 ± 0.03% in G group and 0.02 ± 0.00% in C group, p < 0.0001).

Since mammals cannot synthesize cobalamin, dietary intake represents the only natural source for humans. Dairy products can provide significant levels of cobalamin; moreover, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) panel has set the recommended intake at 4 μg/day for adults. Vitamin B12 content was determined in milk and several matrices related to the process of transformation of the residual whey from Parmigiano Reggiano cheese-making to obtain ricotta cheese. In addition, vitamin B12 degradation during ricotta cheese shelf-life was studied. The analyses were performed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results show that vitamin B12 amount in ricotta from dairy and experimental cheese-making brings respectively 1/8 to 1/4 of the adequate intake in adults established by EFSA. In addition, shelf-life experiment shows that cobalamine is fairly rapidly degraded in ricotta: light effect seems to be significant, even if the light exposure is short.

29524324,"Sulfonamides are antibiotics widely used in the treatment of diseases in dairy cattle. However, their indiscriminate use for disease control may lead to their presence in tissues and milk and their determination requires a sample preparation step as part of an analytical approach. Among the several sample preparation techniques available, those based upon the use of sorptive materials have been widely employed. Recently, the application of ionic liquids immobilized on silica surfaces or polymeric materials has been evaluated for such an application. This manuscript addresses the evaluation of silica-based ionic liquid obtained by a sol-gel synthesis process by basic catalysis as sorbent for online solid-phase extraction with liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry for sulfonamides determination. Infrared vibrational spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the ionic liquid on the silica surface, suggesting that the ionic liquid was anchored on to the silica surface. Other sorbents varying the ionic liquid alkyl chain were also synthesized and evaluated by off-line solid-phase extraction in the sulfonamide extraction. As the length of the alkyl chain increased, the amount of extracted sulfonamides decreased, possibly due to a decrease in the electrostatic interaction caused by the reduction in the polarity, as well as the presence of a hexafluorophosphate anion that increases the hydrophobic character of the material. The use of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate as a selective ionic liquid sorbent enabled the isolation and sulfonamide preconcentration in bovine milk by online solid-phase extraction with liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

29501128,"Tetracyclines are widely used for both the treatment and prevention of diseases in animals as well as for the promotion of rapid animal growth and weight gain. This practice may result in trace amounts of these drugs in products of animal origin, such as milk and eggs, posing serious risks to human health. The presence of tetracycline residues in foods can lead to the transmission of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria through the food chain. In order to ensure food safety and avoid exposure to these substances, national and international regulatory agencies have established tolerance levels for authorized veterinary drugs, including tetracycline antimicrobials. In view of that, numerous sensitive and specific methods have been developed for the quantification of these compounds in different food matrices. One will note, however, that the determination of trace residues in foods such as milk and eggs often requires extensive sample extraction and preparation prior to conducting instrumental analysis. Sample pretreatment is usually the most complicated step in the analytical process and covers both cleaning and pre-concentration. Optimal sample preparation can reduce analysis time and sources of error, enhance sensitivity, apart from enabling unequivocal identification, confirmation and quantification of target analytes.

29500988,"Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are environmentally persistent chemicals widely used in many consumer products due to water and oil proofing and fire-resistant properties. Several PFASs are recognized as environmental pollutants. This study investigated serum concentrations of 18 different PFASs and their associations with diet and lifestyle variables in 940 adolescents (age 15-19 years) who participated in the Fit Futures 1 study in the Troms arctic district of Norway. Serum concentrations of PFASs were analyzed by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UHPLC-MS/MS). The most abundant PFASs in this population were perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) that were found in 99% of the participants. Perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS) was found in 98% of the participants. Median concentrations were: PFOS 6.20 ng/mL, PFOA 1.92 ng/mL, PFHxS 0.71 ng/mL, PFNA 0.50 ng/mL, PFDA 0.21 ng/mL and PFHpS 0.15 ng/mL. Median of PFASs sum concentration (∑PFAS) was 10.7 ng/mL, the concentration range was 2.6-200.8 ng/mL. Intake of fat fish, fish liver, seagull eggs, reindeer meat and drinks with sugar were the main dietary predictors of several PFASs. Intake of junk food (pizza, hamburger, sausages) was positively associated with PFNA, intake of canned food was positively associated with PFHxS. Intake of fruits and vegetables, milk products, snacks and candy was not associated with PFASs concentrations. Lean fish intake was positively associated with PFUnDA, but not with other PFASs.

In this investigation, performance provided by a high resolution (HR) hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap™ MS platform for the multiple allergens detection in processed food matrix is presented. In particular, three different acquisition modes were compared: full-MS, targeted-selected ion monitoring with data-dependent fragmentation (t-SIM/dd2), and parallel reaction monitoring. In order to challenge the HR-MS platform, the sample preparation was kept as simple as possible, limited to a 30-min ultrasound-aided protein extraction followed by clean-up with disposable size exclusion cartridges. Selected peptide markers tracing for five allergenic ingredients namely skim milk, whole egg, soy flour, ground hazelnut, and ground peanut were monitored in home-made cookies chosen as model processed matrix. Timed t-SIM/dd2 was found the best choice as a good compromise between sensitivity and accuracy, accomplishing the detection of 17 peptides originating from the five allergens in the same run.

We compared the distribution of concentrations of urinary inorganic arsenic plus methylated forms (uc(iAs+MMA+DMA)) in four Italian areas with other international studies, and we assessed the relationship between uc(iAs+MMA+DMA) and various exposure factors. We conducted a human biomonitoring study on 271 subjects (132 men) aged 20-44, randomly sampled and stratified by area, gender, and age. Data on environmental and occupational exposure and dietary habits were collected through a questionnaire. Arsenic was speciated using chromatographic separation and inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Associations between uc(iAs+MMA+DMA) and exposure factors were evaluated using the geometric mean ratio (GMR) with a 90% confidence interval by stepwise multiple regression analysis. The 95th percentile value of uc(iAs+MMA+DMA) for the whole sample (86.28 µg/L) was higher than other national studies worldwide. A statistical significant correlation was found between uc(iAs+MMA+DMA) and occupational exposure (GMR: 2.68 [1.79-4.00]), GSTT gene (GMR: 0.68 [0.52-0.80]), consumption of tap water (GMR: 1.35 [1.02-1.77]), seafood (GMR: 1.44 [1.11-1.88]), whole milk (GMR: 1.34 [1.04-1.73]), and fruit/vegetables (GMR: 1.37 [1.03-1.82]).

29389948,"Multiplex serological immunoassays, such as implemented on microarray or microsphere-based platforms, provide greater information content and higher throughput, while lowering the cost and blood volume required. These features are particularly attractive in pediatric food allergy testing to facilitate high throughput multi-allergen analysis from finger- or heel-stick collected blood. However, the miniaturization and microfluidics necessary for creating multiplex assays make them highly susceptible to the ""matrix effect"" caused by interference from non-target agents in serum and other biofluids. Such interference can result in lower sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and quantitative accuracy. These problems have in large part prevented wide-spread implementation of multiplex immunoassays in clinical laboratories. We report the development of a novel method to eliminate the matrix effect by utilizing photocleavable capture antibodies to purify and concentrate blood-based biomarkers (a process termed PC-PURE) prior to detection in a multiplex immunoassay. To evaluate this approach, it was applied to blood-based allergy testing. Patient total IgE was purified and enriched using PC-PURE followed by multiplex microsphere-based detection of allergen-specific IgEs (termed the AllerBead assay). AllerBead was formatted to detect the eight most common pediatric food allergens: milk, soy, wheat, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fin fish and shellfish, which account for >90% of all pediatric food allergies. 205 serum samples obtained from Boston Children's Hospital were evaluated. When PC-PURE was employed with AllerBead, excellent agreement was obtained with the standard, non-multiplex, ImmunoCAP® assay (average sensitivity above published negative predictive cutoffs = 96% and average Pearson r = 0.90; average specificity = 97%). In contrast, poor ImmunoCAP®-correlation was observed when PC-PURE was not utilized (average sensitivity above published negative predictive cutoffs = 59% and average Pearson r = 0.61; average specificity = 97%).

29380598,"The retention index system was proposed in 1958 by Kováts. It is based on the correlation between the retention time of the analytes and the ones of a series of reference standards, making retention data dependent on the chromatographic phenomenon only, viz., on the three-term interaction analyte-stationary phase-mobile phase. Particularly in GC, because the mobile phase has a negligible influence, the retention of the analytes depends almost entirely on the stationary phase and it is as independent as possible from operating conditions. This makes retention index databases usable in samples identification at both the intra- and interlaboratory levels. The scope of this research was to create a similar identification system in LC, where the identification of unknowns is still a challenge because of the unavailability of spectral databases related to the low reproducibility of mass spectra generated by means of the atmospheric pressure ionization technique normally interfaced to LC. Lipid compounds, specifically triacylglycerols, were selected as target analytes mainly due to their regular chromatographic LC profile under reversed phase conditions. The odd carbon chain number triacylglycerol series from trinonain to trinonadecanoin was chosen as the basis of the retention index scale and a database of 209 triacylglycerols was built.

29324088,"For many years, the adulteration of milk from sheep, goats or water buffalos with cows' milk has been a widespread practice due to the higher cost of milk from those other species. Because of this, great concern has been shown by many Protected Designation of Origin councils that have to assure the quality and genuineness of the cheese produced by their associates. Therefore, the whole production chain needs analytical tools that allow the control of potential adulteration. Rapid methods to be used in the field are scarce and have not been validated according to international guidelines. The aim of this work has been to validate a rapid test based on lateral flow immunochromatography to detect cows' milk in milk from other species, including buffalo's milk, according to AOAC guidelines. No false-positive result was found after analysing 146 known negative samples from individual animals. The lowest level of adulteration with a Probability of Detection (POD) of 1.00 (confidence interval between 0.94 and 1.00) was found at 0.5% of cows' milk. This level is below the current EU allowed level of cows' milk, set at 1%. Variations in the time of assay, volume of the analysis buffer and different batches of the test were evaluated to detect any effect on the false-positive rate or on the limit of detection of the test. The effects of compositional factors (such as high level of fat, protein and somatic cell counts) were also evaluated. The new rapid test to detect cows' milk in milk from other species is shown to be an adequate tool to control milk quality in routine analysis.

29291809,"There is an increasing demand for donor human milk to feed infants for various reasons including that a mother may be unable to provide sufficient amounts of milk for their child or the milk is considered unsafe for the baby. Selling and buying human milk via the Internet has gained popularity. However, there is a risk of human milk sold containing other adulterants such as animal or plant milk. Analytical tools for rapid detection of adulterants in human milk are needed. We report a quantitative metabolomics method for detecting potential milk adulterants (soy, almond, cow, goat and infant formula milk) in human milk. It is based on the use of a high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS platform to profile the metabolome of an unknown milk sample, followed by multivariate or univariate comparison of the resultant metabolomic profile with that of human milk to determine the differences. Using dansylation LC-MS to profile the amine/phenol submetabolome, we could detect an average of 4129 ± 297 (n = 9) soy metabolites, 3080 ± 470 (n = 9) almond metabolites, 4256 ± 136 (n = 18) cow metabolites, 4318 ± 198 (n = 9) goat metabolites, 4444 ± 563 (n = 9) infant formula metabolites, and 4020 ± 375 (n = 30) human metabolites. This high level of coverage allowed us to readily differentiate the six different types of samples. From the analysis of binary mixtures of human milk containing 5, 10, 25, 50 and 75% other type of milk, we demonstrated that this method could be used to detect the presence of as low as 5% adulterant in human milk.

Milk proteins are present in uncounted food products, such as cheese, yogurt, or bakery item, exposing allergic persons to a constant threat. Many efforts have been made to overcome this global problem and to improve the life quality of allergic individuals. First, proper and reliable food labeling is fundamental for consumers, but the verification of its compliance is also needed, which should rely on accurate and sensitive analytical methods to detect milk allergens in processed foods. At the same time, strategies to reduce milk allergenicity, such as immunotherapy or the use of food processing techniques to modify allergen structure, have to be extensively studied. Recent research findings on the applicability of food processing, such as heat treatment, fermentation, or high pressure, have revealed great potential in reducing milk allergenicity. In this review, significant research advances on cow milk allergy are explored, focusing on prevalence, diagnosis, and therapy. Molecular characterization of cow milk allergens and cross-reactivity with other nonbovine milk species are described, as well as the effects of processing, food matrix, and digestibility on milk allergenicity.

Nevertheless, only very few food constituents, including plant sterols, have been appointed an approved health claim (European Commission and Food and Drugs Administration). Plant sterols are part of those limited lists of approved compounds for their cholesterol-lowering properties but have been praised for their anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties as well. Despite this indisputable reputation, direct quantitative data is still lacking for naturally present (conjugated) plant sterols in beverages. This study aimed to fill this gap by applying a validated extraction and UPLC-MS/MS detection method to a diverse range of everyday plant-based beverages. β-sitosterol-β-d-glucoside (BSSG) showed to be by far the most abundant sterol in all beverages studied, with concentrations up to 60-90 mg per 100 mL in plant-based milk alternatives and fresh fruit juices. Ergosterol (provitamin D₂) could be found in beers (0.8-6.1 µg per 100 mL, from the yeast) and occasionally in juices (17-29 µg per 100 mL).

In response to domestic and international demand, US production of Gouda cheese has more than doubled in recent years. An understanding of the chemical and sensory properties of Gouda cheese can help manufacturers create desirable products. The objective of this study was to determine the chemical and sensory properties of Gouda cheeses. Commercial Gouda cheeses (n = 36; 3 mo to 5 yr; domestic and international) were obtained in duplicate lots. Volatile compounds were extracted by solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-olfactometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Composition analyses included pH, proximate analysis, salt content, organic acid analysis by HPLC, and color. Flavor and texture properties were determined by descriptive sensory analysis. Focus groups were conducted to document US consumer perception followed by consumer acceptance testing (n = 149) with selected cheeses. Ninety aroma-active compounds in Gouda cheeses were detected by solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-olfactometry. Key aroma-active volatile compounds included diacetyl, 2- and 3-methylbutanal, 2-methylpropanal, methional, ethyl butyrate, acetic acid, butyric acid, homofuraneol, δ-decalactone, and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine. Aged cheeses had higher organic acid concentrations, higher fat and salt contents, and lower moisture content than younger cheeses. Younger cheeses were characterized by milky, whey, sour aromatic, and diacetyl flavors, whereas aged cheeses were characterized by fruity, caramel, malty/nutty, and brothy flavors. International cheeses were differentiated by the presence of low intensities of cowy/barny and grassy flavors. Younger cheeses were characterized by higher intensities of smoothness and mouth coating, whereas aged cheeses were characterized by higher intensities of fracture and firmness. American consumers used Gouda cheese in numerous applications and stated that packaging appeal, quality, and age were more important than country of origin or nutrition when purchasing Gouda cheeses.

29189760,"Palm kernel cake (PKC) is the solid residue following oil extraction of palm kernels and useful to fatten animals either as a single feed with only minerals and vitamins supplementation, or mixed with other feedstuffs such as corn kernels or soy beans. The occurrence of mycotoxins (aflatoxins, ochratoxins, zearalenone, and fumonisins) in feed samples affects the animal's health and also serves as a secondary contamination to humans via consumption of eggs, milk and meats. Of these, aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) is the most toxically potent and a confirmed carcinogen to both humans and animals. Methods such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are common in the determination of mycotoxins. However, these methods usually require sample pre-treatment, extensive cleanup and skilled operator. Therefore, in the present work, a rapid method of electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of AFB₁ was developed based on an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

We examined the cross-sectional associations of dietary patterns and the intake of several nutrients and foods with blood (Pb-B) and urinary (Pb-U) lead concentrations in children (5-8y) from Montevideo, Uruguay. From two 24-hour recalls completed by caregivers, we derived the mean daily intake of select nutrients and food groups (dairy, milk, fruit, root vegetables, foods rich in heme and non-heme iron), as well as ""nutrient dense"" and ""processed"" food patterns. Pb-B (n=315) was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry; Pb-U (n=321) using ICP-MS. Pb-U was adjusted for specific gravity and log-transformed to approximate a normal distribution. Iron deficiency (ID) and dietary variables were tested as predictors of Pb-B and log-Pb-U in covariate-adjusted regressions. Median [5%, 95%] Pb-B and Pb-U were 3.8 [0.8-7.8] μg/dL and 1.9 [0.6-5.1] μg/L, respectively; ~25% of Pb-B above current U.S. CDC reference concentration of 5μg/dL. ID was associated with 0.75μg/dL higher Pb-B, compared to non-ID (p<0.05). Consumption of root vegetables was not associated with Pb-B or log-Pb-U. Higher scores on the nutrient-dense pattern were related with higher Pb-Bs, possibly due to consumption of green leafy vegetables. Dietary intake of iron or iron-rich foods was not associated with biomarkers of lead. Conversely, children consuming more calcium, dairy, milk and yogurt had lower Pb-B and log-Pb-U.

29087807,"Milk is an important and beneficial food from a nutritional point of view, being an indispensable source of high quality proteins. Furthermore, it is a raw material for many dairy products, such as yoghurt, cheese, cream etc. Before reaching consumers, milk goes through production, processing and circulation. Each step involves potentially unsafe factors, such as chemical contamination that can affect milk quality. Antibiotics are widely used in veterinary medicine for dry cow therapy and mastitis treatment in lactating cows, which can cause the presence of antimicrobial residues in milk. In order to ensure consumers' safety, milk is analyzed to make sure that the fixed Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for antibiotics are not exceeded. Multiclass methods can monitor more drug classes through a single analysis, so they are faster, less time-consuming and cheaper than traditional methods (single-class); this aspect is particularly important for milk, which is a highly perishable food. Nevertheless, multiclass methods for veterinary drug residues in foodstuffs are real analytical challenges.

Limonene, an aromatic component of orange juice, was considered as an index compound of aroma leakage, and its seepage on the surface of the container and concentration in the orange juice were measured by GC-MS for 12 commercial samples. After 3 days of storage, limonene was detected on the surface of 8 orange juice containers, and the concentration of limonene in the orange juice was found to have decreased. Thus, limonene leaked through the container within a few days, and the extent of leakage differed between containers, presumably depending upon their barrier properties. In addition, limonene was detected in green tea and milk that was stored together with the unopened orange juice containers at 4℃. The transference of orange aroma into milk was significant, because the contamination of the milk was confirmed by subjective sensory evaluation.

Over the last decades, HPAEC-PAD has been developed into one of the major technologies for this task and represents a popular alternative to state-of-the-art LC-MS oligosaccharide analysis. This work presents the first comprehensive study which gives an overview of the separation of 38 analytes as well as enzymatic hydrolyzates of six different polysaccharides focusing on oligosaccharides. The high sensitivity of the PAD comes at cost of its stability due to recession of the gold electrode. By an in-depth analysis of the sensitivity drop over time for 35 analytes, including xylo- (XOS), arabinoxylo- (AXOS), laminari- (LOS), manno- (MOS), glucomanno- (GMOS), and cellooligosaccharides (COS), we developed an analyte-specific one-phase decay model for this effect over time. Using this model resulted in significantly improved data normalization when using an internal standard. Our results thereby allow a quantification approach which takes the inevitable and analyte-specific PAD response drop into account.

In this study, 224 breast milk samples provided by eight human milk banks in the Federal District of Brazil were analyzed for total mercury (THg), of which 183 were also analyzed for methyl mercury (MeHg), the most relevant form of this metal for the breastfed infants. Samples were acid digested in a microwave oven and THg determined by atomic fluorescence spectrometry (LOQ of 0.76μg/L). Samples were lyophilized, ethylated and MeHg determined in a MERX automated system (LOQ of 0.10μg/L). Inorganic mercury (IHg) levels were estimated from the THg and MeHg determined in the samples. Most of the samples were collected 1-2 months postpartum, with 38% during the first month. Over 80% of the samples had THg values above the LOQ, reaching a maximum of 8.40μg/L, with a mean of 2.56μg/L. On average, MeHg accounted for 11.8% of THg, with a maximum of 97.4%.

28958220,"Perchlorate (ClO4-) is an environmental pollutant that affects human health. Perchlorate acts as a competitive inhibitor of iodine uptake in the thyroid gland (sodium-iodide symporter inhibitor); thus, its determination is important for public health concerns. Water and milk constitute a significant portion of the human diet. Because regular intake leads to an increase in perchlorate concentration in the human body, the estimation of perchlorate is of great concern. In this work, ion-pair single-drop microextraction (SDME) combined with attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy has been developed for the determination of perchlorate in bioenvironmental (soil, water, dairy milk, breast milk, and urine) samples. Perchlorate was extracted in a single drop of methyl isobutyl ketone as an - with the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonuim bromide under optimized conditions. The strongest IR peak (at 1076 cm-1) was selected for the quantification of perchlorate among three observed vibrational peaks. Eight calibration curves for different concentration ranges of perchlorate were prepared, and excellent linearity was observed for absorbance and peak area in the range of 0.03-100 ng/mL perchlorate, with r values of 0.977 and 0.976, respectively. The RSDs (n = 8) for the perchlorate concentration ranges of 0.03-100, 0.03-0.5, 0.5-10, and 10-100 ng/mL were in the range of 1.9-2.7% for the above calibration curves. The LOD and LOQ in the present work were 0.003 and 0.02 ng/mL, respectively. The extracted microdrop was analyzed directly by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The parameters affecting SDME, i.e, effect of pH, stirring rate, reagent concentration, microdrop volume, and extraction time, were optimized, and the role of foreign species was also investigated. F- and t-tests were performed to check the analytical QA of the method. A noteworthy feature of the reported method is the noninterference of any of the associated ions.

28890268,"A new dynamic covalent polymer (DCP) gel was well designed and constructed based on imine chemistry. Polycondensation of 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxaldehyde and 1,3,5-benzenetricarbohydrazide via Schiff-base reaction resulted in an acylhydrazone bond gel (AB-gel) DCP. AB-gel DCP had three-dimensional network of interconnected nanoparticles with hierarchically porous structure. AB-gel DCP was successfully fabricated as a monolithic column by an in-situ chemical bonding method for online enrichment and separation purpose with excellent permeability. AB-gel DCP based monolithic column showed remarkable adsorption affinity towards target analytes including sulfonamides (SAs) and fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) due to its strong π-π affinity, hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding interaction. Then, AB-gel DCP based monolithic column was applied for online separation and analysis of trace SAs and FWAs in food samples coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sulfathiazole (ST) and sulfadimidine (SM2) in one positive weever sample were actually found and determined with concentrations of 273.8 and 286.3μg/kg, respectively. 2,5-Bis(5-tert-butyl-2-benzoxazolyl) thiophene (FWA184) was actually quantified in one tea infusion sample with the concentration of 268.5ng/L. The spiked experiments suggested the good recoveries in range of 74.5-110% for SAs in weever and shrimp samples with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 9.7% and in range of 74.0-113% for FWAs in milk and tea infusion samples with RSDs less than 9.0%.

It is well known that the strains largely involved in the aroma formation of the very appreciated Italian long ripened cheeses belong to the Lactobacillus casei group and origin from raw milk. In this study, a spontaneous fermentation of Parmigiano Reggiano raw milks was carried out to isolate new strains potentially usable as adjunctive aromatic starter. For this reason, specific selection criteria were chosen to isolate strains belonging to L. casei, and L. paracasei species. An integrated approach, by mean of impedance microbiology and SPME GC-MS analysis, was applied to investigate the acidifying performance and the production of volatile compounds of seven strains in UHT whole milk. One of these strains, L. paracasei 4341, appear to be the most interesting one from the technological point of view both for its acidifying and aromatic features.

This method should be applicable for quality control in operations covering a wide range of analyte concentrations to be able to analyse high levels as usually found in adulteration, as well as low levels due to contamination. The paper describes a LC-MS/MS method covering 14 nitrogen-rich adulterants using a simple and fast sample preparation based on dilution and clean-up by dispersive SPE. Quantification is carried out by isotopic dilution reaching LOQs of 0.05-0.20 mg/kg in a broad range of food matrices (infant formula, liquid milk, dairy ingredient, high protein meal, cereal, infant cereal, and meat/fish powder). Validation of seven commodity groups was performed according to SANCO 12571/2013, giving satisfactory results demonstrating the method's fitness for purpose at the validated range at contamination level. Method ruggedness was further assessed by transferring the developed method into another laboratory devoted to routine testing for quality control.

Samples were collected during 7 cheese- and ricotta-making procedures carried out at 2-week intervals from bulk milk to study possible differences in the transfer and modification of FA. Compared with morning milk, evening milk had fewer de novo synthetised FA. The detailed FA profile of partially skimmed milk differed little from that of evening whole milk before skimming, but the cream obtained differed from partially skimmed milk and from fresh cheese in about half the FA, due mainly to higher contents of all de novo FA, and lower contents of n-3 and n-6 FA. Fresh cheese and whey had similar FA profiles. The ricotta manufacturing process affected the partition of FA between ricotta and scotta, the FA profile of the latter differing in terms of groups and individual FA from the former, whereas ricotta and fresh cheese had similar composition of FA. In general, there was an increase in medium-chain saturated FA, and a decrease in many polyunsaturated FA during the first 6 months of ripening, but not during the second 6 months.

PLs are the main structural lipid components of cell and organelle membranes in all living organisms, and therefore, they occur in all organisms and the derived food products. PLs are distinguished by the presence of a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, consequently they possess amphiphilic features.

An alternative colorant was also evaluated. Cheddar whey colored with annatto (15 mL/454 L of milk) was manufactured, pasteurized, and fat separated and then assigned to bleaching treatments of 250 mg/kg HP, 50 mg/kg BP, or 20 mg/kg HP (LP system) at 50°C for 1 h. In addition to a control (whey with norbixin, whey from cheese milk with an alternative colorant (AltC) was evaluated. The control and AltC wheys were also heated to 50°C for 1 h. Wheys were concentrated to 80% protein by ultrafiltration and spray dried. The experiment was replicated in triplicate. Samples were taken after initial milk pasteurization, initial whey formation, after fat separation, after whey pasteurization, after bleaching, and after spray drying for vitamin and carotenoid analyses. Concentrations of retinol, a-tocopherol, water-soluble vitamins, norbixin, and other carotenoids were determined by HPLC, and volatile compounds were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sensory attributes of the rehydrated WPC80 were documented by a trained panel. After chemical or enzymatic bleaching, WPC80 displayed 7.0 to 33.3% reductions in retinol, β-carotene, ascorbic acid, thiamin, α-carotene, and α-tocopherol. The WPC80 bleached with BP contained significantly less of these compounds than the HP- or LP-bleached WPC80.

The new extraction method allows for the rapid and simple extraction of a broad range of lipids directly from HBM samples. Moreover, the optimized two-step lipid extraction protocol ensures high lipidome coverage without using toxic solvents such as chloroform. The use of liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS) and an automated search of a lipid database allows comprehensive identification of the lipids contained in HBM. The demonstrated analytical approach based on SPME sample preparation and LC-Q-TOF-MS is rapid, free of toxic solvents, and suited for the qualitative analysis of the HBM lipid composition.",Journal of proteome research,"['D002853', 'D005260', 'D055772', 'D006801', 'D008055', 'D008895', 'D052617', 'D012997', 'D019032']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Female', 'Green Chemistry Technology', 'Humans', 'Lipids', 'Milk, Human', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Solvents', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Rapid Characterization of the Human Breast Milk Lipidome Using a Solid-Phase Microextraction and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Based Approach.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28737399,2018
28725476,"Food allergy prevalence is rising worldwide, motivating the development of assays that can sensitively and reliably detect trace amounts of allergens in manufactured food. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a promising alternative to commonly employed antibody-based assays owing to its ability to quantify multiple proteins in complex matrices with high sensitivity. In this review, we discuss a targeted MS workflow for the quantitation of allergenic protein in food products that employs selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We highlight the aspects of SRM method development unique to allergen quantitation and identify opportunities for simplifying the process. One promising avenue identified through a comprehensive survey of published MS literature is the use of proteotypic peptides, which are peptides whose presence appears robust to variations in food matrix, sample preparation protocol, and MS instrumentation. We conclude that proteotypic peptides exist for a subset of allergenic milk, egg, and peanut proteins. For less studied allergens such as soy, wheat, fish, shellfish, and tree nuts, we offer guidance and tools for peptide selection and specificity verification as part of an interactive web database, the Allergen Peptide Browser (http://www.AllergenPeptideBrowser.org). With ongoing improvements in MS instrumentation, analysis software, and strategies for targeted quantitation, we expect an increasing role of MS as an analytical tool for ensuring regulatory compliance.",NPJ systems biology and applications,[],[],Food allergen detection by mass spectrometry: the role of systems biology.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28725476,2019

Specifically, we extracted proteins in raw milk, treated with tryptic digestion, and obtained peptide fingerprints by UPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry with proteomics to differentiate authentic milks from their counterparts adulterated with nonmilk proteins. This approach is able to detect soybean and pea powder-adulterated milks at as low as 1% (wt/wt). Additionally, we obtained the characteristic peptide sequences for milk authentication by principal component analysis. The prediction accuracies for milk authentication by partial least-squares-discriminant analysis were greater than 95%.

Commercial yogurts are produced using standard starters while, in the production of non-commercial yogurt, the microbiota is quite different since yogurts are used as starter for years. To determine the final characteristics of the fermented product it is necessary to know the biochemical properties of the starter cultures, such as acidity, aroma and flavor. This can only be achieved by identifying and characterizing the bacteria in starter cultures. In our study, 208 non-commercial yogurt samples were collected from 9 different locations in Anatolia, southern Turkey. Their pH and lactic acid bacteria profiles were analyzed. Isolated bacteria were identified by MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser sesorption-ionization time-of-flight, mass spectrometry), which is a fast and reliable method for identification of bacterial isolates compared to classical laboratory methods. In this study, 41% of the isolates were identified by using this method, which is 99.9% and 34.0% confidence. The isolates contained two genera (Enterococcus and Lactobacillus) and four species.

Associations between natural log-transformed consumption of individual food items and temporally matched natural log-transformed toenail As concentration were quantified using general linear models that accounted for As concentration in the primary drinking water source and other potential confounders. The analysis was stratified by As in drinking water (≤50 μg/L versus >50 μg/L) and the time of dietary assessment (Gestation Week 28 versus Postpartum Week 1). Interestingly, toenail As was not significantly associated with consumption of plain rice as hypothesized. However, toenail As was positively associated with consumption of several vegetable, fish and meat items and was negatively associated with consumption of rice, cereal, fruits, and milk based food items.

Nevertheless, in the present work, the aim was to propose an easy and effective system for the extraction of six of the main mycotoxins from corn meal and durum wheat flour, i.e., the main four aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and the mycoestrogen zearalenone. The developed method exploited magnetic solid phase extraction (SPE), a technique that is attracting an increasing interest as an alternative to classical SPE. Therefore, the use of magnetic graphitized carbon black as a suitable extracting material was tested. The same magnetic material proved to be effective in the extraction of mycoestrogens from milk, but has never been applied to complex matrices as cereals. Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for detection. Recoveries were >60% in both cereals, even if the matrix effects were not negligible.

Material and methods: The content and bioaccesibility (soluble and dialysable fractions) of Fe and Zn were determined. For thisin vitro gastrointestinal digestion in a first phase of gastric digestion (pepsin) followed by a second phase of intestinal digestion (with pancreatin and bile salts) was simulated. The atomic absorption spectrometry mineral content measured in soluble and dialyzable fractions. 
Results: Traditional porridges from Honduras (PTH) showed low density of micronutrients being the PTH prepared based on “rice with beans and greens”, “rice with ground beans” and “beans with banana” which had a higher content values of 1.96, 1.56, and 1.46 mg Fe/100 g, respectively, although in vitroavailability values below 50% of its content. For Zn in these recipes, the values found were very low being below the detection limit.

28340739,"The objective of the work was to develop and validate methods for the total Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) in breast milk that could be further used to obtain first data on chemical contamination of French breast milk. For total Hg determination, the potential of two techniques, namely Advanced Mercury Analyzer (AMA) and ICP MS, was compared. For MeHg determination, ICP MS detection associated to a quantification by isotopic dilution was used and the potential of a preliminary separation by gas or liquid chromatography was evaluated and discussed. The optimization studies have shown that AMA for total Hg determination and HPLC - ID - ICP MS, after a preconcentration step by freeze-drying, for MeHg quantification were the most relevant methods to use for epidemiologic studies. The figures of merit for both methods were evaluated by means of accuracy profiles in terms of limits of quantification (1.82 and 1.35µg Hg/kg dry weight, corresponding to 0.22 and 0.16µg Hg/kg wet basis for total Hg and MeHg, respectively), repeatability (2-11% and 3-8% for total Hg and MeHg respectively), intermediate precision reproducibility (4-12% and 4-8% for total Hg and MeHg respectively) and trueness bias (-0.1-9% and -4-0% for total Hg and MeHg respectively). The methods were then applied to 180 breast milk samples.

It is produced in seven municipalities in the state of Minas Gerais in a region called Serra da Canastra. In this work, samples of milk, ""pingo"" (natural starter), whey and Canastra cheese were collected on a farm in Medeiros-MG/Brazil to evaluate the yeast microbiota and select yeasts for whey fermentation to produce ethanol and volatile aromatic compounds of relevance in the production of cheese. Thirty-nine isolates capable of fermenting lactose in a synthetic medium were identified by MALDI-TOF as Kluyveromyces lactis (29), Torulaspora delbrueckii (7) and Candida intermedia (3). Eleven isolates of K. lactis and three of T. delbrueckii efficiently fermented lactose until 4th day, and due to this reason were selected for cheese whey fermentation with Brix 12, 14 and 18. Generally, the isolates T. delbrueckii B14, B35, and B20 and K. lactis B10 were the most effective regardless of the initial Brix value. The identification of these four isolates by MALDI TOF was confirmed by sequencing of the ITS region. In the fermentation of cheese whey 14 Brix, T. delbrueckii B14 and B35, respectively yielded 24.06g/L and 16.45g/L of ethanol, while K. lactis B10 was more efficient in the consumption of lactose. In sequential culture with K. lactis B10 inoculated 48h after T. delbrueckii B14, 97.82% of the total sugars were consumed resulting in the production of 19.81g/L ethanol and 39 aromatic volatile compounds. The most abundant compounds were 3-methyl-1-butanol, octanoic acid and ethyl decanoate, which are reported as important for the aroma and flavor of cheeses. Based in our results, B10 isolate inoculated 48h after B14 isolate is a promising yeast inoculum to be used for fermentation of dairy substrates.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D001938', 'D002210', 'D002611', 'D003651', 'D005285', 'D005511', 'D005516', 'D007716', 'D007785', 'D009812', 'D000439', 'D019032', 'D013649', 'D055319', 'D055549', 'D000067796', 'D015003']","['Brazil', 'Caprylates', 'Cheese', 'Decanoates', 'Fermentation', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'Kluyveromyces', 'Lactose', 'Odorants', 'Pentanols', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Taste', 'Torulaspora', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Whey', 'Yeasts']",Yeasts from Canastra cheese production process: Isolation and evaluation of their potential for cheese whey fermentation.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000382', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000382', 'Q000145']","[None, 'metabolism', 'microbiology', 'metabolism', None, 'methods', 'methods', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'microbiology', 'classification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28290329,2019

28244372,"The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as bioprotective cultures can be an alternative to chemical preservatives or antibiotic to prevent fungal spoilage in dairy products. Among antifungal LAB, Lactobacillus harbinensis K.V9.3.1Np showed a remarkable antifungal activity for the bioprotection of fermented milk without modifying their organoleptic properties (Delavenne et al., 2015). The aim of the present study was to elucidate the action mechanism of this bioprotective strain against the spoilage yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. To do so, yeast viability, membrane potential, intracellular pH (pHi) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were assessed using flow cytometry analyses after 3, 6 and 10days incubation in cell-free supernatants. The tested supernatants were obtained after milk fermentation with yogurt starter cultures either in co-culture with L. harbinensis K.V9.3.1Np (active supernatant) or not (control supernatant). Scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) was used to monitor yeast cell morphology and 9 known antifungal organic acids were quantified in both yogurt supernatants using high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Yeast growth occurred within 3days incubation in control supernatant, while it was prevented for up to 10days by the active supernatant. Interestingly, between 66 and 99% of yeast cells were under a viable but non-cultivable (VNC) state despite an absence of membrane integrity loss. While ROS production was not increased in active supernatant, cell physiological changes including membrane depolarization and pHi decrease were highlighted. Moreover, morphological changes including membrane collapsing and cell lysis were observed. These effects could be attributed to the synergistic action of organic acids. Indeed, among the 8 organic acids quantified in active supernatant, five of them (acetic, lactic, 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic, hexanoic and 2-hydroxybenzoic acids) were at significantly higher concentrations in the active supernatant than in the control one.

28093042,"Although the use of chloramphenicol (CAP) as a veterinary drug is banned in the European Union and many other countries, monitoring for CAP residues in food is routine. Positive detections are few, but taken extremely seriously. European Union laboratories analysing for CAP should validate methods according to European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC, must be accredited to ISO 17025, and will generally participate in proficiency testing (PT) schemes, such as those offered by the Food Analysis Performance Assessment Scheme (FAPAS®). The FAPAS PTs aim to cover a wide range of relevant matrices including honey, prawns, fish, milk and kidney. Test materials are prepared either by animal dosing studies or by spiking raw matrix. The most common method reported by FAPAS participants used to screen for CAP residues is LC-MS/MS, but ELISA kits are increasingly being used. A recent PT round highlighted that the result obtained might be correlated with the type of analytical method being employed. Follow-up investigations have demonstrated that some of these variations in data are a function of the different stereoisomeric forms of CAP.

However, few studies have examined the effect of Chinese milk vetch (CMV) as GM on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from monocropped rice field in south China. Therefore, a pot-culture experiment with four treatments (control, no FN and CMV; CMV as GM alone, M; fertilizer N alone, FN; integrating fertilizer N with CMV, NM) was performed to investigate the effect of incorporating CMV as GM on N2O emission using a closed chamber-gas chromatography (GC) technique during the rice growing periods. Under the same N rate, incorporating CMV as GM (the treatments of M and NM) mitigated N2O emission during the growing periods of rice plant, reduced the NO3- content and activities of nitrate and nitrite reductase as well as the population of nitrifying bacteria in top soil at maturity stage of rice plant versus FN pots. The global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of N2O from monocropped rice field was ranked as M<NM<FN. However, the treatment of NM increased rice grain yield and soil NH4+ content, which were dramatically decreased in the M pots, over the treatment of FN.

27916960,"The metabolism and excretion of flavor constituents of garlic, a common plant used in flavoring foods and attributed with several health benefits, in humans is not fully understood. Likewise, the physiologically active principles of garlic have not been fully clarified to date. It is possible that not only the parent compounds present in garlic but also its metabolites are responsible for the specific physiological properties of garlic, including its influence on the characteristic body odor signature of humans after garlic consumption. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate potential garlic-derived metabolites in human urine. To this aim, 14 sets of urine samples were obtained from 12 volunteers, whereby each set comprised one sample that was collected prior to consumption of food-relevant concentrations of garlic, followed by five to eight subsequent samples after garlic consumption that covered a time interval of up to 26 h. The samples were analyzed chemo-analytically using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O), as well as sensorially by a trained human panel. The analyses revealed three different garlic-derived metabolites in urine, namely allyl methyl sulfide (AMS), allyl methyl sulfoxide (AMSO) and allyl methyl sulfone (AMSO₂), confirming our previous findings on human milk metabolite composition. The excretion rates of these metabolites into urine were strongly time-dependent with distinct inter-individual differences. These findings indicate that the volatile odorant fraction of garlic is heavily biotransformed in humans, opening up a window into substance circulation within the human body with potential wider ramifications in view of physiological effects of this aromatic plant that is appreciated by humans in their daily diet.",Metabolites,[],[],Detection of Volatile Metabolites Derived from Garlic (Allium sativum) in Human Urine.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27916960,2020

Participants were healthy adolescents (n 54, 15-19 years, 1-90 days postpartum) practicing exclusive breastfeeding. Milk samples were collected 3 days after delivery (colostrum) and in the third month postpartum (mature milk) by hand expression. The fatty acid composition of the milk samples was determined by gas chromatography. TFA intake corresponded to 1.23 % of total energy value. Total 18:2 TFA accounted for less than 0.5 % of the energy intake. The amount of total 18:1 TFA (mean ± SEM) was 1.9 % ± 0.14 in colostrum and 1.5 % ± 0.2 in mature milk. The total content of n-3 PUFA was inversely correlated with the total content of 18:1 TFA in colostrum. Both in colostrum and in mature milk, vaccenic acid (11t-18:1) was found to be the most abundant 18:1 trans isomer, followed by elaidic acid (9t-18:1), whereas rumenic acid (9c,11t-18:2 CLA) was the predominant 18:2 trans isomer. In conclusion, the levels of TFA of industrial sources found in the mother's diet and breast milk (colostrum and mature milk) showed a decrease in relation to those observed in studies conducted prior to the TFA labeling resolution in Brazil.

In this feasibility study, the ratio of Ca:P in conjunction with vitamin D and other essential elements (Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Zn) in a range of commercial infant food products in the UK was investigated. The elemental analysis was carried out using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and vitamin D levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The quantitative data were further evaluated, based on a standardised menu, to measure the total daily intake of an infant aged 7-12 months against the Reference Nutrient Intake. The results from the study show that the Ca:P ratio of the infant's total dietary intake was within the recommended range at 1.49:1. However, the level of intake for each of the nutrients analyzed, with the exception of sodium, was found to be above the Reference Nutrient Intake, which warrants further investigation in relation to both micronutrient interactions and in situations where the intake of fortified infant formula milk is compromised.

This study was conducted to measure the levels of PFOA and PFOS in milk and yogurt from Xinjiang and to investigate the average daily intake (ADI) of these two compounds. PFOA and PFOS levels were analyzed using ultrasonic extraction with methanol and solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Retail milk and yogurt samples present higher detection rates (39.6% and 48.1%) and mean concentrations (24.5 and 31.8 ng/L) of PFOS than those of PFOA (33.0% and 37.0%; 16.2 and 22.6 ng/L, respectively). For raw milk samples, only PFOS was detected. The differences in the levels of the two compounds between samples from the north and south regions were observed, and northern regions showed higher pollution levels than southern regions. On the basis of the retail milk measurements and consumption data, the ADIs of PFOA and PFOS for Xinjiang adults were calculated to be 0.0211 and 0.0318 ng/kg/day, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated intakes of PFOA and PFOS varied among different groupings (age, area, gender, and race) and increased with increasing age. Relevant hazard ratios were found to be far less than 1.0, and this finding suggested that no imminent health damages were produced by PFOA and PFOS intake via milk and yogurt consumption in the Xinjiang population.",International journal of environmental research and public health,"['D000293', 'D000328', 'D000368', 'D017738', 'D000818', 'D002210', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D005260', 'D005466', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D008875', 'D008892', 'D044469', 'D018570', 'D052616', 'D014505', 'D015014', 'D055815']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkanesulfonic Acids', 'Animals', 'Caprylates', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Female', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Middle Aged', 'Milk', 'Racial Groups', 'Risk Assessment', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Urban Population', 'Yogurt', 'Young Adult']",Occurrence of Perfluorooctanoic Acid and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate in Milk and Yogurt and Their Risk Assessment.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000706', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'statistics & numerical data', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27775680,2017
27619751,"On the basis of the fifth Chinese total diet study (TDS) performed in 2011, the dietary exposure of the Chinese population to novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) was assessed. Six NBFRs were determined in 80 composite samples from four animal origin food groups and 29 pooled human milk samples. Based on gas chromatography-negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GC-NCI/MS) analysis, the levels of the total NBFRs ranged from <LOD to 70.2ng/g lipid weight (lw) in food composites and from 2.48 to 23.9ng/g lw in human milk samples. Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), with mean levels of 9.03ng/g lw in food composites and 8.06ng/g lw in human milk, was the most abundant compound in the total NBFRs. No obvious spatial distribution patterns in China were observed in food samples or human milk. The average estimated daily intake (EDI) of total NBFRs via food consumption for a ""standard Chinese man"" was 4.77ng/kg bodyweight (bw)/day, with a range of 0.681 to 18.9ng/kgbw/day. Meat and meat products were the main dietary source of NBFRs, although levels of NBFRs in aquatic food were found to be the highest among the four food groups. The average EDI of total NBFRs for nursing infants was 38.4ng/kgbw/day, with a range of 17.4 to 113ng/kgbw/day, which was approximately eight-fold higher than the EDI for adults, suggesting the heavy body burden of NBFRs on nursing infants. The levels and EDI of DBDPE in the present study were similar to or higher than those of legacy BFRs (i.e., PBDEs and HBCD) in the TDS 2007, indicating that DBDPE, as a main alternative to PBDEs, might have become the primary BFR used in China.",Environment international,"['D000328', 'D000818', 'D001969', 'D002681', 'D000074341', 'D005411', 'D005504', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D008895']","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Bromobenzenes', 'China', 'Dietary Exposure', 'Flame Retardants', 'Food Analysis', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Milk, Human']",Novel brominated flame retardants in food composites and human milk from the Chinese Total Diet Study in 2011: Concentrations and a dietary exposure assessment.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27619751,2018
27592435,"Whey and milk permeates are by-products of high-protein dairy powder manufacture. Previous work has shown that these permeates contribute to salty taste without contributing significantly to sodium content. The objective of this study was to explore the sensory characteristics and compositional analysis of permeates from different milk and whey streams and a low-sodium product application made from them. Skim milk, Cheddar, cottage, and Mozzarella cheese whey permeates were manufactured in triplicate, and delactosed whey permeate was obtained in triplicate. Composition (protein, fat, solids, minerals) was conducted on permeates. Organic acid composition was determined using HPLC. Volatile compounds were extracted from permeates by solid phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A trained sensory panel documented sensory attributes of permeates and cream of broccoli soups with and without salt or permeates followed by consumer acceptance testing (n=105) on the soups. Cottage cheese whey permeate contained a higher lactic acid content than other permeates, which has been shown to contribute to a higher salty taste. Cottage cheese whey permeate also contained potato or brothy and caramel flavors and sour and salty tastes, whereas delactosed whey permeate had high intensities of cardboard and beefy or brothy flavors and salty taste. Milk, Cheddar, and Mozzarella cheese whey permeates were characterized by sweet taste and cooked milky flavor. Permeates with higher cardboard flavor had higher levels of aldehydes. All permeates contributed to salty taste and to salty taste perception in soups; although the control soup with added salt was perceived as saltier and was preferred by consumers over permeate soups. Soup with permeate from cottage cheese was the least liked of all soups, likely due to its sour taste. All other permeate soups scored at parity for liking.

The scope of the method includes plant growth regulators (chlormequat, daminozide, diquat, maleic hydrazide, mepiquat, paraquat), pesticides (cyromazine, the metabolite of the fungicide propineb PTU (propylenethiourea), amitrole), various multiclass antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides quinolones, kasugamycin and mycotoxins (aflatoxin B1, B2, fumonisin B1 and ochratoxin A). Isolation of the analytes from the matrix was achieved with a fast and effective technique. The validation of the multi-residue method was performed at the levels: 10 μg/kg and 100 μg/kg in the following representative substrates: fruits-vegetables (apples, apricots, lettuce and onions), cereals and pulses (flour and chickpeas), animal products (milk and meat) and cereal based baby foods.

The aim of this research is to compare the differences in milk protein content, composition and distribution between River buffalo and their crossbreeds for hybrid screening. Four groups of milk samples that included Nili-Ravi (N), Murrah (M), a Nili-Ravi-Murrah crossbreed (M-N), and a crossbreed of river buffalo with local swamp buffalo (C) were collected. The protein composition of the buffalo milk was determined by RP-HPLC. A gel-based proteomic approach consisting of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry was utilised for the detailed protein characterisation of milk from different breeds. The results of this analysis showed that the river/swamp buffalo crossbreed (C) displayed the highest content of total protein (4·46%) and κ-casein (11·14%) but the lowest content of α-lactalbumin (6·79%). By selecting 23 different protein spots among the four types of milk that contained the most spots corresponding to κ-casein, β-casein and αs1-casein, correlations between the crossbreeds, protein polymorphism and phosphorylation could be made.

In order to obtain high extraction efficiency, the parameters affecting HF-LPME were optimized using a three-factor and three-level Box-Behnken design under response surface methodology. This method was validated according to the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and, for the first time, successfully applied to a wide range of animal source food samples such as fish, milk, and honey as well as the liver and muscles of lamb and chicken. Analytical performance was determined in terms of linearity, intra- and inter-assay precision, detection and quantification limits, matrix effect, accuracy, and drug stability in real samples. Detection and quantitation limits for the different antibiotics ranged between 0.5-20ngg(-1) and 1.25-40ngg(-1), respectively. Intra and inter-day repeatability, expressed as the relative standard deviation, were in the ranges of 3.4-10.7% and 5.0-11.5%, respectively. The procedure allows good preconcentration factors of 175-700. The results of the validation process proved that the method is suitable for determining TCs and QNs residues in surveillance programs. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method was successfully confirmed by the extraction and determination of nine antibiotics in various animal source food samples. The importance of this methodology relies on the combination of HF-LPME/HPLC-DAD second-order data with multivariate curve resolution-alternative least squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm, which improves the resolution of some overlapped chromatograms and, hence, increases the accuracy and repeatability of drug determination.

The Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique was applied to several whey samples used for Ricotta production to evaluate the microbial community composition in depth using both RNA and DNA as templates for NGS library construction. Whey samples demonstrating a high microbial and aerobic spore load contained mostly Firmicutes; although variable, some samples contained a relevant amount of Gammaproteobacteria. Several lots of whey acquired as raw material for Ricotta production presented defective organoleptic properties. To define the volatile compounds in normal and defective whey samples, a headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was conducted. The statistical analysis demonstrated that different microbial communities resulted from DNA or cDNA library sequencing, and distinguishable microbiota composed the communities contained in the organoleptic-defective whey samples.

27579006,"Milk-derived bioactive peptides have been identified as potential ingredients of health-promoting functional foods. These bioactive peptides are targeted at diet-related chronic diseases especially the non-communicable diseases viz., obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Peptides derived from the milk of cow, goat, sheep, buffalo and camel exert multifunctional properties, including anti-microbial, immune modulatory, anti-oxidant, inhibitory effect on enzymes, anti-thrombotic, and antagonistic activities against various toxic agents. Majority of those regulate immunological, gastrointestinal, hormonal and neurological responses, thereby playing a vital role in the prevention of cancer, osteoporosis, hypertension and other disorders as discussed in this review. For the commercial production of such novel bioactive peptides large scale technologies based on membrane separation and ion exchange chromatography methods have been developed. Separation and identification of those peptides and their pharmacodynamic parameters are necessary to transfer their potent functional properties into food applications. The present review summarizes the preliminary classes of bioactive milk-derived peptides along with their physiological functions, general characteristics and potential applications in health-care.

It is therefore a challenge to detect cross-contamination in food production that could endanger an allergic customer's life. Here we used ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry for simultaneous detection of traces of milk (casein, whey protein), egg (yolk, white), soybean, and peanut allergens in different complex and/or heat-processed foodstuffs. The method is based on a single protocol (extraction, trypsin digestion, and purification) applicable to the different tested foodstuffs: chocolate, ice cream, tomato sauce, and processed cookies. The determined limits of quantitation, expressed in total milk, egg, peanut, or soy proteins (and not soluble proteins) per kilogram of food, are: 0.5mg/kg for milk (detection of caseins), 5mg/kg for milk (detection of whey), 2.5mg/kg for peanut, 5mg/kg for soy, 3.4mg/kg for egg (detection of egg white), and 30.8mg/kg for egg (detection of egg yolk).

To further the understanding of the relationship between dietary silicon intake and bone health, a food composition database of commonly consumed foods in Korea is required. For quantitative data on the intake levels of silicon, we analyzed the silicon content of 365 food items commonly consumed in Korea using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry following microwave-assisted digestion. To investigate the dietary silicon intake status and to examine the potential role of dietary silicon intake in the bone status of men, a total of 400 healthy Korean adult males aged 19-25 were observed for their diet intake and calcaneus bone density using the 24-h recall method and quantitative ultrasound, respectively. Clinical markers reflecting bone metabolism such as serum total alkaline phosphatase, N-mid osteocalcin, and type 1 collagen C-terminal telopeptide concentrations were also analyzed. Silicon intake of the subjects was estimated as 37.5 ± 22.2 mg/day. Major food sources of dietary silicon in the Korean male were cereal and cereal products (25.6 % of total silicon intake), vegetables (22.7 %), beverages and liquors (21.2 %), and milk and milk products (7.0 %). Silicon intake correlated positively with age, weight, energy intake, protein intake, calcium intake, and alcohol intake. After adjusted for age, weight, energy intake, protein intake, calcium intake, alcohol intake, smoking cigarettes, and regular exercise status, daily total silicon intake had no correlation with calcaneus bone density and the bone metabolism markers, but silicon intake from vegetables had a positive correlation with serum total alkaline phosphatase activity, a bone formation maker.

The type and concentration of the coagulants influenced both volatile composition and sensory scores of the cheeses. Principal component analysis separated the cheeses based on the use of 2 coagulants in various combinations and ripening time. The cheeses produced using higher concentrations of R. miehei were separately located on the plot compared with the cheeses produced using higher concentrations of camel chymosin. Sensory evaluation of the cheeses showed that, in general, the cheeses produced using higher concentrations of camel chymosin received higher body and texture and odor and flavor scores than the cheese produced using higher concentrations of R. miehei.

Cheese samples were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion to measure total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity of the cheese digesta, and to determine the catechin recovery after digestion by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Addition of catechin or green tea extract significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased TPC and antioxidant activity (measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power and oxygen radical absorbance capacity) of the full-fat cheese without affecting pH or proximate composition. HPLC analysis confirmed retention of encapsulated catechins in the cheese curd; however, individual catechins were recovered in differing amounts (15-52%) from cheese digesta after 6 h of digestion. Transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy provided evidence for association of nanoliposomes with the surface of milk fat globules inside the cheese matrix.

27300310,"Human breast milk is considered as the best and ideal form of nutrition for infants. However, food contaminants such as mycotoxins, which may be transferred from maternal blood to milk, are poorly described. Mycotoxins are a major group of natural toxins frequently detected in foods. Here, we review the current state-of-the-art in the monitoring of mycotoxins in human breast milk, i.e., knowledge on occurrence, metabolism, and analytical assays utilized for their quantification. We highlight that most of the data captured to date have not been verified with the precision now capable utilizing LC-MS/MS and LC-HRMS approaches. One concern is that some studies may overestimate individual measures, and most cannot capture the patterns and levels of mycotoxin mixtures. We propose accurate assessment as a priority, especially for aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, and deoxynivalenol as well as their major metabolites. However, also so-called emerging toxins such as citrinin, the enniatins, beauvericin, aurofusarin, or Alternaria toxins should be considered to evaluate their potential relevance. Key requirements for analytical quality assurance are identified and discussed to guide future developments in this area. Moreover, research needs including investigations of lactational transfer rates, the role of human metabolism for bioactivation or detoxification, and an evaluation of potential combinatory effects of different mycotoxins are pointed out.

27299776,"Water buffalo (WB) casein (CN) and curd samples from indigenous Italian and international breeds were examined with the objective of identifying signature peptides that could function as an indicator to determine the origin of their milk products. CN in complex mixtures were digested with trypsin, and peptide fragments were subsequently identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The unique presence of a β-CN A variant and an internally deleted αs1-CN (f35-42) variant in international WB milk samples was ascertained by identifying signature tryptic peptides from either dephosphorylated or native CN. Four signature unphosphorylated peptides derived from β-CN A, i.e. (f49-68) Asn(68) (2223.6 Da), (f1-28) Ser(10) (3169.4 Da), (f1-29) Ser(10) (3297.4 Da) and (f33-48) Thr(41) (1982 Da) and two from αs1-CN (f35-42) deleted fragments, i.e. (f23-34) Met(31) (1415.7 Da) and (f43-58) Val(44) (1752.7 Da), were identified. Two signature casein phosphopeptides (CPPs), i.e. β-CN (f1-28) 4P (3489.1 Da) and β-CN (f33-48) 1P (2062.0 Da), were identified in the tryptic hydrolysate of native casein or curd and cheese samples using in-batch hydroxyapatite (HA) chromatography. All these fragments functioned as analytical surrogates of two αs1- and β-casein variants that specifically occur in the milk of international WB breeds. Furthermore, the bovine peptide β-CN (f1-28) 4P had a distinct and lower molecular mass compared with the WB counterpart and functioned as a species-specific marker for all breeds of WB. Advantages of this analytical approach are that (i) peptides are easier to separate than proteins, (ii) signature peptide probes originating from specific casein variants allow for the targeting of all international WB milk, curd and cheese samples and (iii) bovine and WB casein in mixtures can be simultaneously determined in protected designation of origin (PDO) ""Mozzarella di Bufala Campana"" cheese.

Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by standard methods, separated and quantified by gas chromatography. We aimed to investigate the fatty acid composition (% of total fatty acid) in human milk of three lactating stages from three regions in China and the relationship with maternal dietary intake during lactation. Present results showed that the fatty acid composition of breast milk varied with lactating period and geographical regions in China. In all the milk samples, the total saturated fatty acid (SFA) remained stable. However, C10:0 and C12:0 increased over the lactation period, total monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) significantly increased from colostrum (34.50%) to transitional milk (37.06%), and total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) showed its highest percentage in colostrum (29.58%). In particular, C22:6n-3 and C22:5n-3 were lowest in mature milk (0.38% and 0.41%, respectively), and C18:3n-3 (1.83%) was lowest in colostrum.

The volatile compounds were extracted and analyzed by SPME-GC-MS and cheese odour and aroma profiles were studied by descriptive sensory analysis. Control cheese was made only with a mesophilic starter and experimental cheeses with L. reuteri were made with and without glycerol. The addition of L. reuteri INIA P572 to milk enhanced the formation of six volatile compounds. Despite the changes in the volatile compounds profile, the use of L. reuteri INIA P572 did not noticeably affect the sensory characteristics of cheese. On the other hand, the addition of L. reuteri INIA P572 coupled with 30mM glycerol enhanced the formation of twelve volatile compounds, but decreased the formation of five ones. The use of the biopreservation system did not affect overall odour and aroma quality of cheese although it resulted in a significant decrease of the odour intensity scores. In addition, this cheese received significant higher scores for ""cheesy"" aroma and significant lower scores for the aroma attributes ""milky"", ""caramel"" and ""yogurt-like"". The first two axes of a principal component analysis (PCA) performed for selected volatile compounds and sensory characteristics, accounting for 75% of the variability between cheeses, separated cheeses made with L. reuteri INIA P572 and glycerol from the rest of cheeses, and also differentiated control cheese from cheeses made with L. reuteri INIA P572 from day 60 onward.

Solid-phase extraction-ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UPLC-MS/MS) was applied for direct epicatechin metabolite analysis. Their bioavailability in BM as a result of dietary ingestion was confirmed in a preliminary experiment with a single dose of dark chocolate. Several host and microbial phase II metabolites of epicatechin were detected in BM among free-living lactating mothers. Interestingly, a modest correlation between dihydroxyvalerolactone sulfate and the intake of cocoa products was observed. Although a very low percentage of dietary polyphenols is excreted in BM, they are definitely in the diet of breastfed infants.

Of these, only AMS had a garlic-like odor whereas the other two metabolites were odorless. This demonstrates that the odor change in human milk is not related to a direct transfer of garlic odorants, as is currently believed, but rather derives from a single metabolite. The formation of these metabolites is not fully understood, but AMSO and AMSO₂ are most likely formed by the oxidation of AMS in the human body.

27213448,"We aimed to assess the correlation between docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dietary intake and the plasma, erythrocyte and breast milk DHA concentrations in lactating women residing in the coastland, lakeland and inland areas of China. A total of 408 healthy lactating women (42 ± 7 days postpartum) were recruited from four hospitals located in Weihai (coastland), Yueyang (lakeland) and Baotou (inland) city. The categories of food containing DHA, the average amount consumed per time and the frequency of consumption in the past month were assessed by a tailored DHA food frequency questionnaire, the DHA Intake Evaluation Tool (DIET). DHA dietary intake (mg/day) was calculated according to the Chinese Food Composition Table (Version 2009). In addition, fasting venous blood (5 mL) and breast milk (10 mL) were collected from lactating women. DHA concentrations in plasma, erythrocyte and breast milk were measured using capillary gas chromatography, and were reported as absolute concentration (μg/mL) and relative concentration (weight percent of total fatty acids, wt. %). Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the correlation between intakes of DHA and its concentrations in biological specimens. The study showed that the breast milk, plasma and erythrocyte DHA concentrations were positively correlated with DHA dietary intake; corresponding correlation coefficients were 0.36, 0.36 and 0.24 for relative concentration and 0.33, 0.32, and 0.18 for absolute concentration (p < 0.05). The median DHA dietary intake varied significantly across areas (p < 0.05), which was highest in the coastland (24.32 mg/day), followed by lakeland (13.69 mg/day), and lowest in the inland (8.84 mg/day). The overall relative and absolute DHA concentrations in breast milk were 0.36% ± 0.23% and 141.49 ± 107.41 μg/mL; the concentrations were significantly lower in inland women than those from coastland and lakeland.

The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) values obtained were 6μgkg(-)(1) and 18μgkg(-)(1), respectively. The mean recovery range obtained for all food at a fortification level of 200μgkg(-)(1) was 85-110%. Accuracy was evaluated using dogfish liver certified reference material (DOLT-3 NRC) for trace metals. The highest total arsenic concentrations (in μgkg(-)(1)) were found in fish (152-439), rice (87-316) and rice-based products (52-201). The contribution to inorganic arsenic (i-As) intake was calculated from the mean i-As content of each food (calculated by applying conversion factors to total arsenic data) and the mean consumption per day. The primary contributors to inorganic arsenic intake were wheat flour, including its proportion in wheat flour-based products (breads, pasta and cookies), followed by rice; both foods account for close to 53% and 17% of the intake, respectively.

The selected analytes were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD) and gas chromatography with thermionic sensitive detection (GC-TSD). The estimated limits of detection for most target analytes were in the μg/kg level (range 0·001-0·320 µg/kg). The purpose of the study was to determine the selected analytes, to assess the exposure of babies and infants and to produce data for comparison with tolerable limits according to the European Union Regulations. In most of the samples the organochlorine pesticides values were under the limit of detection. Exceptions were heptachlor epoxide and endosulfan sulphate, the last of which was found in all analysed samples at low concentrations. We also found detectable levels of ethoprophos, parathion-methyl, chlorpyrifos, prothiofos, guthion, disulfoton and fenchlorphos in most of the analysed samples. Benzo[a]pyrene, which is used as an indicator for the presence of PAHs, was not detected in selected samples.

The first objective was to assess human exposure to AFs among Haitians at an urban hospital (GHESKIO) and a rural health centre (HCBH). The second objective was to test the association between AF exposure and reported dietary intake of potentially contaminated foods, such as maize, peanut products and milk. Measurement of urinary AFM1 by HPLC revealed that among 367 participants 14% and 22% at GHESKIO and HCBH, respectively, had detectable AFM1. The maximum and median AFM1 concentrations for all detected samples were 700 pg AFM1 ml(-1) and 11.7 pg ml(-1), respectively. Detection of AFM1 was significantly associated with peanut consumption (p < 0.05). Controlling for diet and age group in a logit model, patients who reported peanut consumption the day of the survey and patients from HCBH had greater log odds of excreting detectable AFM1 (p < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively); females had lower log odds (p = 0.020). Recalled frequency of consuming non-dairy animal-sourced foods, an indicator of diet quality, approached significance (p = 0.056) as an inverse predictor of urinary AFM1 detection. The findings augur the need for interventions that will improve food safety in Haiti and limit exposure to AFs, particularly among rural communities. ","Food additives & contaminants.

27133588,"Cyclopropane fatty acids (CPFA), as lactobacillic acid and dihydrosterculic acid, are components of bacterial membranes and have been recently detected in milk and in dairy products from cows fed with corn silage. In this paper, a specific quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for the detection of CPFA in cheeses was developed, and the quality parameters of the method (limit of detection, limit of quantitation, and intralaboratory precision) were assessed. Limit of detection and quantitation of CPFA were, respectively, 60 and 200 mg/kg of cheese fat, and the intralaboratory precision, determined on three concentration levels, satisfied the Horwitz equation. This method was applied to 304 samples of PDO cheeses of certified origin, including Parmigiano Reggiano (Italy), Grana Padano (Italy), Fontina (Italy), Comté (France), and Gruyère (Switzerland). Results showed that CPFA were absent in all of the cheeses whose Production Specification Rules expressly forbid the use of silages (Parmigiano Reggiano, Fontina, Comté, and Gruyère). CPFA were instead present in variable concentrations (300-830 mg/kg of fat) in all of the samples of Grana Padano cheese (silages admitted). A mix of grated Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano was also prepared, showing that the method is able to detect the counterfeiting of Parmigiano Reggiano with other cheeses up to 10-20% Grana Padano content. These results support the hypothesis that CPFA can be used as a marker of silage feedings for cheeses, and the data reported can be considered a first attempt to create a database for CPFA presence in PDO cheeses.

27107652,"Human milk is an important source of beneficial nutrients and antibodies for newborns and infants and, under certain circumstances, its analysis may provide information on mothers' and infants' exposure to various contaminants. In the presented study, we have introduced the new analytical approach for analysis of 24 highly occurring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in this indicator matrix. The sample preparation procedure is based on an ethyl acetate extraction of milk; the transfer of analytes into an organic layer is enhanced by addition of inorganic salts, i.e. sodium chloride and magnesium sulphate. Following the clean-up of a crude extract on silica SPE columns, gas chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry is used for PAH identification and quantitation. The average recoveries of targeted PAHs from spiked samples were in the range of 68-110% with repeatabilities below 30% and method quantitation limits ranging from 0.03 to 0.3ng/g lipid weight. This newly validated method was successfully applied for analyses of 324 human milk samples collected from nonsmoking women during two sampling periods (summer and winter) in two residential areas in the Czech Republic differing in atmospheric pollution by PAHs. From 24 targeted analytes 17 were detected at least in one sample. Phenantherene, fluoranthrene, pyrene and fluorene were the most abundant compounds found at average concentration of 13.81, 1.80, 0.86, and 2.01ng/g lipid weight respectively. Comparing the data from two sampling periods, in both areas higher concentrations were measured in samples collected during winter. Also in the highly industrialized locality with heavily contaminated air PAH amounts in milk were higher than in the control locality.

In the absence of DA, the thioglycolic acid-wrapped CdTe/CdS Q-dots exhibit the high fluorescence spectrum and low RRS spectrum, so are selected to develop an easy-to-get system. In the presence of DA, the thioglycolic acid-wrapped CdTe/CdS Q-dots and DA form a complex through electrostatic interaction, which result in the RRS intensity getting enhanced significantly with new RRS peaks appearing at 317 and 397 nm; the fluorescence is powerfully quenched. Under optimum conditions, the scattering intensities of the two peaks are proportional to the concentration of DA in the range of 0.0061-3.0 μg mL(-1).

26992495,"Sterols/oxysterols in food may be free or bound i.e. esterified with fatty acids. Methods commonly applied to determine those compounds in such matrices (based on various analytical techniques) usually start with hydrolysis of the food lipid fraction, which means that the results are no good indication of concentration of free sterols/oxysterols only. But only free oxysterols are proatherogenic factors, bound ones are not. There are some published methods selectively sensitive to free oxysterols only, but they are capable to determine only a few compounds and feature very low recovery rates. The aim of this work was to develop a method to determine various free (non-esterified) sterols/oxysterols in various food matrices. The developed method is based on the GC-IT-MS technique used in the chemical ionization mode. It was applied to determine 16 different free sterols/oxysterols in egg powder, cheese, butter, milk and salami. Fat extracted from the given matrix is purified on a specially prepared silica-gel bed to separate the sterol fraction from the oxysterol one. Sterols are silylated using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and trimethylchlorosilane BSTFA:TMCS, then GC-IT-MS analysed. The method features high recovery rates (75-95%), high reproducibility (RSD<20%), and sensitivity within the 0.01-0.3 mg 100 g(-1) range, depending on the analysed compound.

Conventional methods to detect melamine in foods, such as Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), are sensitive but they are time-consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. In this research, near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging technique combined with regression coefficient of partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was used to detect melamine particles in milk powders easily and quickly. NIR hyperspectral reflectance imaging data in the spectral range of 990-1700nm were acquired from melamine-milk powder mixture samples prepared at various concentrations ranging from 0.02% to 1%. PLSR models were developed to correlate the spectral data (independent variables) with melamine concentration (dependent variables) in melamine-milk powder mixture samples. PLSR models applying various pretreatment methods were used to reconstruct the two-dimensional PLS images. PLS images were converted to the binary images to detect the suspected melamine pixels in milk powder. As the melamine concentration was increased, the numbers of suspected melamine pixels of binary images were also increased.

26910555,"Mozzarella di Bufala Campana is a soft, stretched curd Italian cheese made from fresh buffalo milk that obtained the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) registration in EU legislation. Seasonality of buffalo milk production, rapid cheese decay and transport of its preserving liquid have relevant practical/economic consequences for mozzarella production; consequently, a progressive diffusion of cheese products realized with frozen curd or frozen milk has recently been observed. In order to meet the demand of the dairy producers and consumers for a reduction of starting material adulterations and for the certification of the raw milk used for cheese manufacturing, we have developed a rapid/robust MALDI-TOF-MS polypeptide profiling procedure that assays material quality through the identification of specific markers of its freshness. Massive analysis of fresh and frozen buffalo milks (stored for different times) was realized to this purpose; a tough statistical evaluation of the resulting data ultimately permitted the typing of milk samples. We identified 28 polypeptide markers of the milk freezing storage, among which 13 and 15 showed down- and over-representation, respectively. Quantitative data were confirmed by an independent analytical approach on selected markers. GLYCAM1-derived phosphopeptides (1-53), β-casein-derived phosphopeptides (1-68), β-casein-derived γ2-, γ3- and γ4-fragments, α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were components showing the highest significance. The occurrence of the first compounds in buffalo milk is here described for the first time; their formation in the frozen material was ascribed to the activity of plasmin or of unknown bacterial proteases/peptidases stable at low temperatures.

It was decided to merge the two activities after the agreement signed between ISO and AOAC in June 2012 to develop common standards and to avoid duplicate work. The collaborative study was performed after having provided highly satisfactory single-laboratory validation results [Golay, P.A., & Dong, Y. (2015) J. AOAC Int. 98, 1679-1696] that exceeded the performance criteria defined in AOAC Standard Method Performance Requirement (SMPR(®)) 2012.011 (September 29, 2012) on 12 products selected by the AOAC Stakeholder Panel on Infant Formula (SPIFAN). After a qualification period of 1 month, 18 laboratories participated in the fatty acids analysis of 12 different samples in duplicate. Six samples were selected to meet AOAC SPIFAN requirements (i.e., infant formula and adult nutritionals in powder and liquid formats), and the other Six samples were selected to meet ISO-IDF requirements (i.e., dairy products such as milk powder, liquid milk, cream, butter, infant formula with milk, and cheese). The fatty acids were analyzed directly in all samples without preliminary fat extraction, except in one sample (cheese). Powdered samples were analyzed after dissolution (i.e., reconstitution) in water, whereas liquid samples (or extracted fat) were analyzed directly. After addition of the internal standards solution [C11:0 fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and C13:0 triacylglycerols (TAG)] to the samples, fatty acids attached to lipids were transformed into FAMEs by direct transesterification using methanolic sodium methoxide. FAMEs were separated using highly polar capillary GLC and were identified by comparison with the retention times of pure analytical standards. Quantification of fatty acids was done relative to C11:0 FAME as internal standard and to instrument response factors (determined separately using calibration standards mixture). The performance of the method (i.e., transesterification) was monitored in all samples using the second internal standard, C13:0 TAG. RSDR values were summarized separately for labeled fatty acids in SPIFAN materials and ISO-IDF materials due to different expression of results. This method was applied to representative dairy, infant formula, and adult/pediatric nutritional products and demonstrated global acceptable reproducibility precision for all fatty acids analyzed (i.e., 46 individuals and/or groups) for these categories of products.

A sample preparation method that enables high reproducibility and throughput is key in reliably identifying proteins present or proteins responding to conditions such as a diet, health or genetics. Using skim milk samples from Jersey and Holstein-Friesian cows, we compared three extraction procedures which have not previously been applied to samples of cows' milk. Method A (urea) involved a simple dilution of the milk in a urea-based buffer, method B (TCA/acetone) involved a trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone precipitation, and method C (methanol/chloroform) involved a tri-phasic partition method in chloroform/methanol solution. Protein assays, SDS-PAGE profiling, and trypsin digestion followed by nanoHPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-ESI-MS/MS) analyses were performed to assess their efficiency. Replicates were used at each analytical step (extraction, digestion, injection) to assess reproducibility. Mass spectrometry (MS) data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD002529. Overall 186 unique accessions, major and minor proteins, were identified with a combination of methods. Method C (methanol/chloroform) yielded the best resolved SDS-patterns and highest protein recovery rates, method A (urea) yielded the greatest number of accessions, and, of the three procedures, method B (TCA/acetone) was the least compatible of all with a wide range of downstream analytical procedures.

The participants were recruited among employees from a Campus of the University of São Paulo, which provided food samples from their homes, as well as serum and urine samples four times every three months, from June 2011 until March 2012. The probable daily intake (PDI) of aflatoxin was estimated by using the results from analysis of food products collected by the time of samples collection, and data from a 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire. Analyses of AFB1 and AFM1 in food samples were conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Biomarkers in serum and urine were determined by tandem mass spectrometry. AFB1 and AFM1 were detected in 38 samples of cereals (28%, N=136) and 31 milk products (36%, N=86), respectively. AFB1-lysine and AFB1-N(7)-guanine and were not detected in serum or urine samples, respectively.

26601590,"Direct comparison of cow and goat performance and milk fatty acid responses to diets known to induce milk fat depression (MFD) in the bovine reveals relevant species-by-diet interactions in ruminal lipid metabolism. Thus, this study was conducted to infer potential mechanisms responsible for differences in the rumen microbial biohydrogenation (BH) due to diet and ruminant species. To meet this objective, 12 cows and 15 goats were fed a basal diet (control), a similar diet supplemented with 2.2% fish oil (FO), or a diet containing 5.3% sunflower oil and additional starch (+38%; SOS) according to a 3 × 3 Latin square design with 25-d experimental periods. On the last day of each period, fatty acid composition (by gas chromatography) and bacterial community (by terminal-RFLP), as well as fermentation characteristics, were measured in rumen fluid samples. Results showed significant differences in the response of cows and goats to dietary treatments, although variations in some fermentation parameters (e.g., decreases in the acetate-to-propionate ratio due to FO or SOS) were similar in both species. Main alterations in ruminal BH pathways potentially responsible for MFD on the SOS diet (i.e., the shift from trans-11 to trans-10 18:1 and related increases in trans-10,cis-12 18:2) tended to be more pronounced in cows, which is consistent with an associated MFD only in this species. However, changes linked to FO-induced MFD (e.g., decreases in 18:0 and increases in total trans-18:1) were stronger in caprine rumen fluid, which may explain their unexpected susceptibility (although less marked than in bovine) to the negative effect of FO on milk fat content. Altogether, these results suggest that distinct ruminal mechanisms lead to each type of diet-induced MFD and confirm a pronounced interaction with species. With regard to microbiota, differences between cows and goats in the composition of the rumen bacterial community might be behind the disparity in the microorganisms affected by the experimental diets (e.g., Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Succinivibrionaceae in the bovine, and Pseudobutryrivibrio, Clostridium cluster IV, Prevotella, and Veillonellaceae in the caprine), which hindered the assignation of bacterial populations to particular BH steps or pathways.

The method is based on the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) with reducing sugars in alkaline medium in the presence of 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (neocuproine: Nc), followed by the formation of a colored Cu(I)-Nc charge-transfer complex. All simple sugars tested had the linear regression equations with almost equal slope values. The proposed method was successfully applied to fresh apple juice, commercial fruit juices, milk, honey and onion juice.

26589945,"This study reports a fast and automated analytical procedure for the analysis of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk and dairy products. The method is based on the simultaneous protein precipitation and AFM1 extraction, by salt-induced liquid-liquid extraction (SI-LLE), followed by an online solid-phase extraction (online SPE) coupled to ultra-high-pressure-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis to the automatic pre-concentration, clean up and sensitive and selective determination of AFM1. The main parameters affecting the extraction efficiency and accuracy of the analytical method were studied in detail. In the optimal conditions, acetonitrile and NaCl were used as extraction/denaturant solvent and salting-out agent in SI-LLE, respectively. After centrifugation, the organic phase (acetonitrile) was diluted with water (1:9 v/v) and purified (1mL) by online C18 cartridge coupled with an UHPLC column. Finally, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition mode was applied to the detection of AFM1. Validation studies were carried out on different dairy products (whole and skimmed cow milk, yogurt, goat milk, and powder infant formula), providing method quantification limits about 25 times lower than AFM1 maximum levels permitted by EU regulation 1881/2006 in milk and dairy products for direct human consumption. Recoveries (86-102%) and repeatability (RSD<3, n=6) meet the performance criteria required by EU regulation N. 401/2006 for the determination of the levels of mycotoxins in foodstuffs. Moreover, no matrix effects were observed in the different milk and dairy products studied. The proposed method improves the performance of AFM1 analysis in milk samples as AFM1 determination is performed with a degree of accuracy higher than the conventional methods. Other advantages are the reduction of sample preparation procedure, time and cost of the analysis, enabling high sample throughput that meet the current concerns of food safety and the public health protection.

Postpartum, it is speculated that maternal vitamin D status decreases due to transfer of vitamin D from mother to child through breast milk. A few studies have investigated changes in maternal vitamin D postpartum and possible determinants. Thus, the aims of the present study were to determine changes in serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) between 2 weeks and 12 months postpartum in Swedish women and to evaluate lactation and other determinants for changes in 25(OH)D concentration postpartum. In total, seventy-eight women were studied at 2 weeks, 4 months and 12 months postpartum. Data collection included measurements of weight and height as well as information about lactation, sun exposure, use of oestrogen contraceptives and physical activity level. Blood samples were collected and serum 25(OH)D levels were analysed using liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Dietary intake of vitamin D was recorded using 4-d food diaries. For all the women studied, mean serum 25(OH)D did not change between 2 weeks and 12 months postpartum (67 (SD 23) v. 67 (SD 19) nmol/l). No association was found between lactation and changes in serum 25(OH)D concentration postpartum. Significant determinants for postpartum changes in 25(OH)D concentration were use of vitamin D supplements (P=0·003), use of oestrogen contraceptives (P=0·013) and season (P=0·005). In conclusion, no changes were observed in 25(OH)D concentrations during the 1st year postpartum in these women and no association was found between lactation and changes in 25(OH)D concentration postpartum.

In this work, a 24 kDa protein from buffalo cheese whey was analyzed by mass spectrometry and presented homology with Bos taurus beta-lactoglobulin. In addition, the proteins present in buffalo cheese whey were hydrolyzed with pepsin and with different combinations of trypsin, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase-A. When the TNBS method was used the obtained hydrolysates presented DH of 55 and 62% for H1 and H2, respectively. Otherwise for the OPA method the DH was 27 and 43% for H1 and H2, respectively. The total antioxidant activities of the H1 and H2 samples with and without previous enzymatic hydrolysis, determined by DPPH using diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radical, was 4.9 and 12 mM of Trolox equivalents (TE) for H2 and H2Dint, respectively. The increased concentrations for H1 and H2 samples were approximately 99% and 75%, respectively. The in vitro gastrointestinal digestion efficiency for the samples that were first hydrolyzed was higher compared with samples not submitted to previous hydrolysis. After in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, several amino acids were released in higher concentrations, and most of which were essential amino acids.

The performance of the method was evaluated by analyzing spiked samples in the quantification range 2.5-30 ng/g (R² = 0.92-0.99). The limit of quantification (LOQ) in milk and the limit of detection (LOD) in shrimp was 2.5 ng/g, for both SEA and SEB toxins. The in-house reproducibility (RSD) was 8%-30% and 5%-41% at different concentrations for milk and shrimp, respectively. The method was compared to the ELISA method, used at the EU-RL (France), for milk samples spiked with SEA at low levels, in the quantification range of 2.5 to 5 ng/g. The comparison showed good coherence for the two methods: 2.9 (MS)/1.8 (ELISA) and 3.6 (MS)/3.8 (ELISA) ng/g. The major advantage of the developed method is that it allows direct confirmation of the molecular identity and quantitative analysis of SEA and SEB at low nanogram levels using a label and antibody free approach. Therefore, this method is an important step in the development of alternatives to the immune-assay tests currently used for staphylococcal enterotoxin analysis.

26365752,"Dehydro pyrrolizidine alkaloids (dehydro PAs) are carcinogenic phytotoxins prevalent in the Boraginaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae families. Dehydro PAs enter the food and feed chain by co-harvesting of crops intended for human and animal consumption as well as by carry-over into animal-based products such as milk, eggs and honey. Recently the occurrence of dehydro PAs in teas and herbal teas has gained increasing attention from the EU, due to the high levels of dehydro PAs found in commercially available teas and herbal teas in Germany and Switzerland. Furthermore, several tropane alkaloids (TAs, e.g. scopolamine and hyoscyamine) intoxications due to the consumption of contaminated herbal teas were reported in the literature. The aim of the present study was to determine the dehydro PAs and TAs levels in 70 pre-packed teabags of herbal and non-herbal tea types sold in supermarkets in Israel. Chamomile, peppermint and rooibos teas contained high dehydro PAs levels in almost all samples analysed. Lower amounts were detected in black and green teas, while no dehydro PAs were found in fennel and melissa herbal teas. Total dehydro PAs concentrations in chamomile, peppermint and rooibos teas ranged from 20 to 1729 μg/kg. Except for black tea containing only mono-ester retrorsine-type dehydro PAs, all other teas and herbal teas showed mixed patterns of dehydro PA ester types, indicating a contamination by various weed species during harvesting and/or production. The TA levels per teabag were below the recommended acute reference dose; however, the positive findings of TAs in all peppermint tea samples warrant a more extensive survey. The partially high levels of dehydro PAs found in teas and herbal teas present an urgent warning letter to the regulatory authorities to perform routine quality control analysis and implement maximum residual levels for dehydro PAs.","Food additives & contaminants.

26364106,"The guarantee of the origin and quality of raw material is essential for the protection and valorization of Campana buffalo mozzarella cheese. The risk of utilization of semifinished products and stored milk in substitution for fresh milk is increasing, due to the continuous desire to reduce production costs. A proteomics approach and electrophoresis survey of retail mozzarella cheeses indicated different rates of proteolysis in the production of dairy industries. The use of fresh milk and correct cheesemaking protocol yielded only γ-caseins, which are derived from β-casein by plasmin, and para-κ-casein, which is derived from κ-casein by chymosin. The detection of abnormal hydrolysis resulting in β- and αS1-casein fragments, identified by mass spectrometry, indicates the use of stored milk or stored and pressed curd, or the reuse of unsold mozzarella cheese, to produce mozzarella. The formation of γ-caseins and other fragments during a long storage of raw materials at room or refrigeration temperature was ascribed to plasmin (endogenous milk enzyme), whereas formation of αS1-casein fragments, mainly αS1-I(6P)- and αS1-I(7P)-casein during the storage of curd was ascribed to the action of chymosin (exogenous enzyme) from rennet.

Western diet provides low ALA and DHA, which is reflected in low DHA in maternal milk. Chia oil extracted from chia (Salvia hispanica L.), a plant native to some Latin American countries, is high in ALA (up to 60%) and thereby is an alternative to provide ALA with the aim to reduce DHA deficits. We evaluated the modification of the fatty acid profile of milk obtained from Chilean mothers who received chia oil during gestation and nursing. Forty healthy pregnant women (22-35 years old) tabulated for food consumption, were randomly separated into two groups: a control group with normal feeding (n = 21) and a chia group (n = 19), which received 16 mL chia oil daily from the third trimester of pregnancy until the first six months of nursing. The fatty acid profile of erythrocyte phospholipids, measured at six months of pregnancy, at time of delivery and at six months of nursing, and the fatty acid profile of the milk collected during the first six months of nursing were assessed by gas-chromatography. The chia group, compared to the control group, showed (i) a significant increase in ALA ingestion and a significant reduction of linoleic acid (LA) ingestion, no showing modification of arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA; (ii) a significant increase of erythrocyte ALA and EPA and a reduction of LA. AA and DHA were not modified; (iii) a increased milk content of ALA during the six months of nursing, whereas LA showed a decrease. AA and EPA were not modified, however DHA increased only during the first three months of nursing.

Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with a single-stage Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer (UHPLC-HRMS Exactive™-Orbitrap Technology) was successfully exploited for the complete selective and quantitative determination of 33 target compounds within three major cross categories (pesticides, antibiotics and mycotoxins) in bakery matrices (specifically milk, wheat flour and mini-cakes). Resolution was set at 50 000 full width at half maximum (FWHM) to achieve the right compromise between an adequate scan speed and selectivity, allowing for the limitations related to the necessary generic sample preparation approach. An exact mass with tolerance of 5 ppm and minimum peak threshold of 10 000 units were fixed as the main identification conditions, including retention time and isotopic pattern as additional criteria devoted to greatly reducing the risk of false-positive findings. The full validation for all the target analytes was performed: linearity, intermediate repeatability and recovery (28 analytes within 70-120%) were positively assessed; furthermore, limits of quantification between 5 and 100 µg kg(-1) (with most of the analytes having a limit of detection below 6 µg kg(-1)) indicate good performance, which is compatible with almost all the regulatory needs. Naturally contaminated and fortified mini-cakes, prepared through combined use of industrial and pilot plant production lines, were analysed at two different concentration levels, obtaining good overall quantitative results and providing preliminary indications of the potential of full-scan HRMS cluster analysis. The effectiveness of this analytical approach was also tested in terms of the formulation of hypotheses for the identification of other analytes not initially targeted which can have toxicological implications (e.g. 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol and deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside), opening a window on retrospective investigation perspectives in food safety laboratories.","Food additives & contaminants.

26188572,"Rapid, cost-effective monitoring of milk technological traits is a significant challenge for dairy industries specialized in cheese manufacturing. The objective of the present study was to investigate the ability of mid-infrared spectroscopy to predict rennet coagulation time, curd-firming time, curd firmness at 30 and 60min after rennet addition, heat coagulation time, casein micelle size, and pH in cow milk samples, and to quantify associations between these milk technological traits and conventional milk quality traits. Samples (n=713) were collected from 605 cows from multiple herds; the samples represented multiple breeds, stages of lactation, parities, and milking times. Reference analyses were undertaken in accordance with standardized methods, and mid-infrared spectra in the range of 900 to 5,000cm(-1) were available for all samples. Prediction models were developed using partial least squares regression, and prediction accuracy was based on both cross and external validation. The proportion of variance explained by the prediction models in external validation was greatest for pH (71%), followed by rennet coagulation time (55%) and milk heat coagulation time (46%). Models to predict curd firmness 60min from rennet addition and casein micelle size, however, were poor, explaining only 25 and 13%, respectively, of the total variance in each trait within external validation. On average, all prediction models tended to be unbiased. The linear regression coefficient of the reference value on the predicted value varied from 0.17 (casein micelle size regression model) to 0.83 (pH regression model) but all differed from 1. The ratio performance deviation of 1.07 (casein micelle size prediction model) to 1.79 (pH prediction model) for all prediction models in the external validation was <2, suggesting that none of the prediction models could be used for analytical purposes. With the exception of casein micelle size and curd firmness at 60min after rennet addition, the developed prediction models may be useful as a screening method, because the concordance correlation coefficient ranged from 0.63 (heat coagulation time prediction model) to 0.84 (pH prediction model) in the external validation.

First of all, C8 and polar embedded C18 columns were chosen as the first and second dimensional column respectively according to hydrophobic-subtraction model, which constituted excellent orthogonal separation system. The detection wavelengths were set at 263 nm for vitamin D3, 296 nm for vitamin E and 325 nm for vitamin A. The purification of vitamin D3 and quantifications of vitamins A and E were completed simultaneously in the first dimensional separation using the left pump of Dual Gradient LC (DGLC) with methanol, acetonitrile and water as mobile phases. The heart-cutting time window of vitamin D3 was confirmed according to the retention time of vitamin D3 in the first dimensional separation. The elute from the first dimensional column (1-D column) which contained vitamin D3 was collected by a 500 µL sample loop and then taken into the second dimensional column (2-D column) by the right pump of DGLC with methanol, acetonitrile and water as mobile phases. The quantification of vitamin D3 was performed in the second dimensional separation with vitamin D2 as internal standard. At last, this method was applied for the analysis of the three vitamins in milk powder, cheese and yogurt. The injected sample solution with no further purification was pre-treated by hot-saponification using 1. 25 kg/L KOH solution and extracted by petroleum ether solvent. The recoveries of vitamin D3 spiked in all samples were 75.50%-85.00%. There was no statistically significant difference for the results between this method and standard method through t-test.

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the microorganisms most commonly isolated. Novel agents are required in agricultural industries to prevent the development of mastitis. The production of biofilm by Staph. aureus facilitates the adhesion of bacteria to solid surfaces and contributes to the transmission and maintenance of these bacteria. The effect of the essential oils of Syzygium aromaticum (clove; EOSA) and Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon; EOCZ) and their major components, eugenol and cinnamaldehyde, on Staph. aureus biofilm formation on different surfaces was investigated. The results showed a significant inhibition of biofilm production by EOSA on polystyrene and stainless steel surfaces (69.4 and 63.6%, respectively). However, its major component, eugenol, was less effective on polystyrene and stainless steel (52.8 and 19.6%, respectively). Both EOCZ and its major component, cinnamaldehyde, significantly reduced biofilm formation on polystyrene (74.7 and 69.6%, respectively) and on stainless steel surfaces (45.3 and 44.9%, respectively). These findings suggest that EOSA, EOCZ, and cinnamaldehyde may be considered for applications such as sanitization in the food industry.

Since no prophylactic treatment is available, finding ligands capable of binding BLG and reducing its allergenicity is currently the focus of research. In this work, an innovative methodology encompassing microfluidics based on fully automated chip-nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI), coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) on a quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF MS) instrument was developed. This platform was employed for the assessment of the noncovalent interactions between maltohexaose (Glc6) and β-lactoglobulin extracted from human milk upon deliberate intake of cow's milk. The experiments were carried out in (+) ESI mode, using ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) as the buffer and also in pure water. In both cases, the MS analysis revealed the formation of BLG-Glc6 complex, which was characterized by top-down fragmentation in tandem MS (MS/MS) using collision-induced dissociation (CID). Our findings have a significant biomedical impact, indicating that Glc6 binds BLG under conditions mimicking the in vivo environment and therefore might represent a ligand, able to reduce its allergenicity.",Amino acids,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D006801', 'D007782', 'D008895', 'D009844', 'D013045', 'D053719']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Humans', 'Lactoglobulins', 'Milk, Human', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Species Specificity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",β-Lactoglobulin detected in human milk forms noncovalent complexes with maltooligosaccharides as revealed by chip-nanoelectrospray high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26123988,2016
26111266,"Aflatoxins are toxic fungal metabolites, which can be found in feed. Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is excreted into milk when ruminants ingest aflatoxin B1 contaminated feedstuffs. Due to its carcinogenic potential, contamination of milk and dairy products with AFM1 may pose a risk for consumers. Hence, it is considered a public health concern. In this survey, the level of AFM1 contamination of dairy products marketed in Costa Rica was determined by enzyme-assisted extraction, immunoaffinity clean-up and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescent detector (HPLC-FLD) in fluid milk (n = 70), fresh cheese (n = 70) and sour cream (n = 70) collected at local convenience stores and supermarkets. AFM1 concentrations in milk and fresh cheese ranged from 19 to 629 ng/L and from 31 to 276 ng/L, with mean values of 136 ng/L and 74 ng/L, respectively, whereas none of the sour cream samples analysed tested positive for this aflatoxin. In 30 milk samples, and 10 cheese samples, AFM1 concentrations surpassed threshold concentrations as established by the European Commission. Thus, sour cream and - to a lesser extent - cheese manufacturing seems to reduce the amount of AFM1 present in milk, possibly due to fraction redistribution or microbiological degradation. The survey results reveal improper quality control procedures in the Costa Rican dairy industry. Therefore, a surveillance programme for dairy products in our country is recommended.","Food additives & contaminants.

The method involves a simple generic solid-liquid extraction step (solvent extraction, SE) with 0.1% formic acid in aqueous solution of EDTA 0.1% (w/v)-acetonitrile (ACN)-methanol (MeOH) (1:1:1, v/v) with additional ultrasonic-assisted extraction. Precipitation of lipids and proteins was promoted by subjecting the extracts at very low temperature (-23°C) for 12h. Further cleanup with hexane ensures fat removal from the matrix. Analysis was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Two separate runs were performed for positive and negative ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). Particular attention was devoted to extraction optimization: different sample-to-extracting volume ratios, different concentrations of formic acid in the extraction solvent and different ultrasonic extraction temperatures were tested in butter, egg and milk powder samples. The method was also applied in fish tissue samples. It was validated, on the basis of international guidelines, for all four matrices. Quantitative analysis was performed by means of standard addition calibration. For over 80% of the analytes, the recoveries were between 50% and 120% in all matrices studied, with RSD values in the range of 1-18%.

25977030,"We present the application of a novel ambient LESA-MS method for the authentication of processed meat products. A set of 25 species and protein-specific heat stable peptide markers has been detected in processed samples manufactured from beef, pork, horse, chicken and turkey meat. We demonstrate that several peptides derived from myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins are sufficiently resistant to processing to serve as specific markers of processed products. The LESA-MS technique required minimal sample preparation without fractionation and enabled the unambiguous and simultaneous identification of skeletal muscle proteins and peptides as well as other components of animal origin, including the milk protein such as casein alpha-S1, in whole meat product digests. We have identified, for the first time, six fast type II and five slow/cardiac type I MHC peptide markers in various processed meat products. The study demonstrates that complex mixtures of processed proteins/peptides can be examined effectively using this approach.

25932746,"We have developed and describe here for the first time a highly sensitive method for the fast and unambiguous detection of viable Escherichia coli in food matrices. The new approach is based on using label-free phages (T4), obligate parasites of bacteria, which are attractive for pathogen detection because of their inherent natural specificity and ease of use. A specific immunomagnetic separation was used to capture the progeny phages produced. Subsequently, T4 phage markers were detected by liquid chromatography coupled to targeted mass spectrometry. Combining the specificity of these three methodologies is of great interest in developing an alternative to conventional time-consuming culture-based technologies for the detection of viable bacteria for industrial applications. First, optimization experiments with phage T4 spiked in complex matrices (without a phage amplification event) were performed and demonstrated specific, sensitive, and reproducible phage capture and detection in complex matrices including Luria-Bertani broth, orange juice, and skimmed milk. The method developed was then applied to the detection of E. coli spiked in foodstuffs (with a phage amplification event). After having evaluated the impact of infection duration on assay sensitivity, we showed that our assay specifically detects viable E. coli in milk at an initial count of ≥1 colony-forming unit (cfu)/mL after an 8-h infection. This excellent detection limit makes our new approach an alternative to PCR-based assays for rapid bacterial detection.

25849036,"A dose-response study was carried out to examine the carryover of zearalenone (ZEN), deoxynivalenol (DON) and their metabolites into bovine milk. Therefore, a feeding trial with 30 dairy cows fed with three different levels of Fusarium (FUS) toxin-contaminated maize was performed. A control group (0.02 mg ZEN kg(-1) dry matter (DM) and 0.07 DON kg(-1) DM) was compared with two groups fed contaminated diets. The first diet contained 0.33 mg ZEN kg(-1) DM and 2.62 mg DON kg(-1) DM (group FUS-50) and the second diet contained 0.66 mg ZEN kg(-1) DM and 5.24 mg DON kg(-1) DM (group FUS-100). For milk sample analysis, a new cost-efficient sample preparation method was developed for the simultaneous determination of ZEN, DON and their metabolites. The method comprised the separation of the milk fat followed by an SPE clean-up on Oasis HLB and a LC-MS/MS measurement. The less toxic metabolite de-epoxy-DON had the highest detected concentration (5.6 ng ml(-1) milk) in the milk samples obtained from the feeding trial. Additionally, ZEN (up to 0.29 ng ml(-1)), α-zearalenol (up to 0.17 ng ml(-1)), β-zearalenol (up to 0.95 ng ml(-1)) and DON (up to 2.5 ng ml(-1)) were detected in these samples.

25830907,"3-Monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) is a heat-induced food contaminant that has been widely investigated for decades. This paper presents an overview of current knowledge about 3-MCPD, including its formation routes, occurrence in various foodstuffs, analytical approach, toxicological aspects, and future research perspectives. So far, 3-MCPD was determined in its free and bound form in thermally treated foods, edible oils and fats, and infant foods including human breast milk. Contaminants in infant foods and human breast milk were highlighted in this paper as a serious problem as they can pose a potential hazard for infants. The analytical approach of 3-MCPD determination has been modified for over a decade. Nowadays, the method based on determining the derivative of this compound by using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry is widely used. However, there is still a big need for developing new methods that would produce repeatable results. Some of the toxicologic aspects associated with 3-MCPD still remain unknown. A number of studies on the carcinogenicity and genotoxicity of 3-MCPD were carried out on rodents; however, no clinical studies on humans have been reported so far. Moreover, both detrimental effect on kidneys and antifertility activity have been widely reported. The knowledge of 3-MCPD absorption into body fluids and tissues and its metabolic pathways is based on sometimes conflicting data derived from different studies. In conclusion, although a lot of research has been carried out on 3-MCPD, there is still a need for further research in this area.

25814275,"To help safeguard the food supply and detect the presence of undeclared food allergens and gluten, most producers and regulatory agencies rely on commercial test kits. Most of these are ELISAs with a few being PCR-based. These methods are very sensitive and analyte specific, requiring different assays to detect each of the different food allergens. Mass spectrometry offers an alternative approach whereby multiple allergens may be detected simultaneously. However, mass spectrometry requires expensive equipment, highly trained analysts, and several years before a quantitative approach can be achieved. Using multianalyte profiling (xMAP®) technology, a commercial multiplex test kit based on the use of established antibodies was developed for the simultaneous detection of up to 14 different food allergens plus gluten. The assay simultaneously detects crustacean seafood, egg, gluten, milk, peanut, soy, and nine tree nuts (almond, Brazil nut, cashew, coconut, hazelnut, macadamia, pine nut, pistachio, and walnut). By simultaneously performing multiple tests (typically two) for each analyte, this magnetic bead-based assay offers built-in confirmatory analyses without the need for additional resources. Twenty-five of the assays were performed on buffer extracted samples, while five were conducted on samples extracted using reduced-denatured conditions. Thus, complete analysis for all 14 allergens and gluten requires only two wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. This makes it possible to include in a single analytical run up to 48 samples. All 30 bead sets in this multiplex assay detected 5 ng/mL of food allergen and gluten with responses greater than background. In addition, 26 of the bead sets displayed signal/noise ratios of five or greater. The bead-based design makes this 30-plex assay expandable to incorporate new antibodies and capture/detector methodologies by ascribing these new detectors to any of the unassigned bead sets that are commercially available.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000485', 'D028527', 'D004797', 'D005504', 'D005512', 'D005983', 'D007118', 'D059346']","['Allergens', 'Cuminum', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Glutens', 'Immunoassay', 'Magnets']",Multiplex detection of food allergens and gluten.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25814275,2016

First, the interactions between Cr(VI) and the matrices were investigated by size-exclusion HPLC-ICP-MS (SEC-ICP-MS). Evidence was found for the complexation of Cr(VI) potentially present with the ligands. For quantification of Cr(VI), the method was based on an alkaline extraction (NH4OH solution at pH 11.5) followed by Cr(VI) determination by anion-exchange HPLC-ICP-MS. Analytical performances of the method were satisfactory in terms of linearity, specificity, accuracy, repeatability, and intermediate precision. Detection limits ranged from 1 to 10 μg/kg, depending on the matrices investigated. The method was then applied for the determination of Cr(VI) in several products (dairy products, flour, chocolate, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, eggs, and beverages) from different brands and origins. Cr(VI) was found in none of the samples investigated. To further investigate the reason for this absence, a stability study of spiked Cr(VI) was therefore conducted.

As one of the PAEs family, DMP has long been a problem of great concern due to its potential impacts on human health. In order to detect DMP with high sensitivity and specificity, a sensitive indirect competitive biotin-streptavidin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BA-ELISA) has been established in this study. A high-titer rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb-DMP) targeting DMP was obtained, and the procedures of BA-ELISA were optimized for the determination of DMP in milk and milk products. Under optimal conditions, good linearity was achieved within a range of 0.024 to 6.027 μg L(-1), with low cross-reactivity values for DMP structural analogues (lower than 10%). The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.356 μg L(-1) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.0082 μg L(-1). Finally, the concentrations of DMP in milk and milk products ranged from 1.03 μg kg(-1) to 7.23 μg kg(-1) by BA-ELISA. Satisfactory recoveries (90.26-112.38%) and coefficient of variation (CV) values (5.08-8.46%) were obtained.

Every simple action that humans undertake, such as drinking water, eating, nursing, and even breathing air, puts the system under environmental xenobiotic exposure stress. Environmental chemicals have been shown to produce unwanted effects on health and remove the right to healthy living, starting from the first encounter in utero to geriatrics, throughout the lifespan. Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels, important members of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), have been detected before in human breast milk and also in the adipose tissue of women from different regions of Turkey; however, there was no information about the blood levels of these chemicals. This study generated the first information that evaluates OCP and PCB contamination levels in the blood of the women living in Turkey. The current study measured the blood concentrations of OCPs and PCBs in 58 healthy women (age 20-41 years; mean age 28 years) who were living in Istanbul, Turkey, in the years 2010-2012. Samples were analyzed for 29 OCPs and 18 PCB congeners using high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). PCB 153 was the predominant congener (643.2 pg/g lipid), followed by PCB 138 and PCB 180. 4,4'-DDE (24872.8 pg/g lipid) was the most common organochlorinated pesticide contaminant in studied blood samples.

25682427,"An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography based method, coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS), was developed to permit the detection and quantification of various nitrofuran and chloramphenicol residues in a number of animal based food products. This method is based on the hydrolysis of covalently bound metabolites and derivatization with 2-nitrobenzaldehyde. Clean-up is achieved by a liquid/liquid and a reversed phase/solid phase extraction. Not only are the four conventional nitrofurans (nitrofurantoin, furazolidone, nitrofurazone and furaltadone) detected, but also nifursol, nitrovin and nifuroxazide. Furthermore, an underivatizable nitrofuran (nifurpirinol) and another banned drug (chloramphenicol) can be quantified as well. The compounds are detected in the form of their precursor ions, [M+H](+) and [M-H](-), respectively. The mass resolving power of 70,000 FWHM, and the applied mass window ensure sufficient selectivity and sensitivity. Confirmation is obtained by monitoring the HRMS resolved product ions which were derived from the unit-mass resolved precursor ions. The multiplexing capability of the utilized Orbitrap instrument provides not only highly selective, but also sensitive confirmatory signals.

Correlation between the AOA and the redox potential and the biological activity of the tocochromanols was observed. The second aim was to analyse different kinds of wheat, vegetable oils, milk and milk cream on their antioxidant capacity (AOC) by using PCL and α-TEAC. The contents of vitamin E and carotenoids were analysed by HPLC. Correlations between the sum of carotenoids and vitamin E and the AOC were detected.

25569333,"Functional barriers in food contact materials (FCMs) are used to prevent or reduce migration from inner layers in multilayer structures to food. The effectiveness of functional barrier layers was investigated in coloured polystyrene (PS) bowls due to their intended condition of use with hot liquids such as soups or stew. Migration experiments were performed over a 10-day period using USFDA-recommended food simulants (10% ethanol, 50% ethanol, corn oil and Miglyol) along with several other food oils. At the end of the 10 days, solvent dyes had migrated from the PS bowls at 12, 1 and 31,000 ng cm(-)(2) into coconut oil, palm kernel oil and Miglyol respectively, and in coconut oil and Miglyol the colour change was visible to the human eye. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed that the functional barrier was no longer intact for the bowls exposed to coconut oil, palm kernel oil, Miglyol, 10% ethanol, 50% ethanol and goat's milk. Additional tests showed that 1-dodecanol, a lauryl alcohol derived from palm kernel oil and coconut oil, was present in the PS bowls at an average concentration of 11 mg kg(-1). This compound is likely to have been used as a dispersing agent for the solvent dye and aided the migration of the solvent dye from the PS bowl into the food simulant. The solvent dye was not found in the 10% ethanol, 50% ethanol and goat's milk food simulants above their respective limits of detection, which is likely to be due to its insolubility in aqueous solutions. A disrupted barrier layer is of concern because if there are unregulated materials in the inner layers of the laminate, they may migrate to food, and therefore be considered unapproved food additives resulting in the food being deemed adulterated under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.","Food additives & contaminants.

25547312,"The present study was conducted to evaluate the lactic acid- and acetaldehyde-producing abilities of lactic acid bacterial species isolated from traditionally manufactured Turkish yogurts using HPLC. The lactic acid bacterial species purified from the yogurts were the 2 most widely used species in industrial yogurt production: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. These bacteria have the ability to ferment hexose sugars homofermentatively to generate lactic acid and some carbonyl compounds, such as acetaldehyde through pyruvate metabolism. The levels of the compounds produced during fermentation influence the texture and the flavor of the yogurt and are themselves influenced by the chemical composition of the milk, processing conditions, and the metabolic activity of the starter culture. In the study, morphological, biochemical, and molecular characteristics were employed to identify the bacteria obtained from homemade yogurts produced in different regions of Turkey. A collection of 91 Strep. thermophilus and 35 L. bulgaricus strains were investigated for their lactic acid- and acetaldehyde-formation capabilities in various media such as cow milk, LM17 agar, and aerobic-anaerobic SM17 agar or de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar. The amounts of the metabolites generated by each strain in all conditions were quantified by HPLC. The levels were found to vary depending on the species, the strain, and the growth conditions used. Whereas lactic acid production ranged between 0 and 77.9 mg/kg for Strep. thermophilus strains, it ranged from 0 to 103.5 mg/kg for L. bulgaricus. Correspondingly, the ability to generate acetaldehyde ranged from 0 to 105.9 mg/kg in Strep. thermophilus and from 0 to 126.9 mg/kg in L. bulgaricus. Our study constitutes the first attempt to determine characteristics of the wild strains isolated from traditional Turkish yogurts, and the approach presented here, which reveals the differences in metabolite production abilities of the wild lactic acid bacteria strains, holds the potential for the selection of the most desirable strains to be used as starters in commercial yogurt manufacture in the future.

Canned coconut milk was thermally processed (121 °C for 5 min), and then stored at ambient temperature (32 to 35 °C) for 6 mo. Volatile compounds were assessed monthly using direct solvent extraction (diethyl ether), followed by high-vacuum distillation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Six groups of compounds consisting of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, lactones, and others were identified. Two stages of major changes in profile of volatiles were observed. The 1st occurred after 2 mo as indicated by a high abundance of alcohols, acids, and lactones. The 2nd was observed after 5 mo and corresponded to a large increase in lactones, short-chain free fatty acids, 3-methyl-2(5H)-furanone, and phenol. Acetic and butyric acids observed after 5 mo could contribute to the potential of off-odor development in the product as indicated by their high odor activity values.

The effect of polymerization conditions on SPME of the target analytes was studied thoroughly. The physicochemical properties of the monolith were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Several conditions affecting the extraction efficiency were investigated and, under the optimized conditions, a simple and sensitive method for the determination of trace benzimidazoles residues in milk and honey was established by coupling MEMF-SPME with high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (MEMF-SPME-HPLC-DAD). Under the optimum experimental conditions, the limits of detection (S/N = 3) of the method were 0.11-0.30 μg L(-1) for milk and 0.086-0.28 μg L(-1) for honey. Evaluation of intra-day and inter-day precision showed reproducibility was satisfactory-relative standard deviations (RSD) for both were <10 %.

These countries were chosen as representatives of the diet in South America, Western Asia, Mediterranean countries and South-Eastern Europe. The analysis of foodstuffs was carried out by turbulent flow chromatography (TFC) combined with liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS) using electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative mode. The analytical method was validated for the analysis of different foodstuff classes (cereals, fish, fruit, milk, ready-to-eat foods, oil and meat). The analytical parameters of the method fulfill the requirements specified in the Commission Recommendation 2010/161/EU. Recovery rates were in the range between 70% and 120%. For all the selected matrices, the method limits of detection (MLOD) and the method limits of quantification (MLOQ) were in the range of 5 to 650 pg/g and 17 to 2000 pg/g, respectively. In general trends, the concentrations of PFASs were in the pg/g or pg/mL levels. The more frequently detected compounds were perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA). The prevalence of the eight-carbon chain compounds in biota indicates the high stability and bioaccumulation potential of these compounds. But, at the same time, the high frequency of the shorter chain compounds is also an indication of the use of replacement compounds in the new fluorinated materials. When comparing the compounds profile and their relative abundances in the samples from diverse origin, differences were identified. However, in absolute amounts of total PFASs no large differences were found between the studied countries. Fish and seafood were identified as the major PFASs contributors to the diet in all the countries. The total sum of PFASs in fresh fish and seafood was in the range from the MLOQ to 28ng/g ww. According to the FAO-WHO diets composition, the daily intake (DI) of PFASs was calculated for various age and gender groups in the different diets. The total PFASs food intake was estimated to be between 2300 and 3800 ng /person per day for the different diets. Finally, the risk intake (RI) was calculated for selected relevant compounds.

Fumonisin B1 was extracted using methanol:acetone, cleaned up with Strong Anion Exchange columns and quantified by HPLC. Fumonisin B1 exposure in each child was estimated using deterministic approach. Out of the 131 samples, 58 (44.3%) contained fumonisin B1 at levels ranging from 6.57 to 471.05 ng/ml. Of the contaminated samples, 10.3% had fumonisin B1 levels above the EU limit of 200 ppb for fumonisins in infants' food.

Fatty acids present in milk and ice cream were determined by gas chromatography. Sensory analysis results showed that the ice cream acceptability index was above 70%. No difference was observed for proximate composition in milk and ice cream. Chromatographic analysis showed an increase in saturated fatty acid concentration in CON and lower levels in PAL; polyunsaturated fatty acid concentration was higher in PAL and lower in CON, in milk and ice cream; monounsaturated fatty acid concentration in milk was higher in PAL and lower in CON but no difference was found in ice cream.

Mothers can be exposed to different contaminants as a result of their lifestyle and environmental pollution. Mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) could adversely affect the development of fetal and neonatal nervous system. Some fish and shellfish are rich in selenium (Se), an essential trace element that forms part of several enzymes related to the detoxification process, including glutathione S-transferase (GST). The goal of this study was to determine the interaction between Hg, As and Se and analyze its effect on the activity of GST in breast milk. Milk samples were collected from women between day 7 and 10 postpartum. The GST activity was determined spectrophotometrically; total Hg, As and Se concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. To explain the possible association of Hg, As and Se concentrations with GST activity in breast milk, generalized linear models were constructed. The model explained 44% of the GST activity measured in breast milk. The GLM suggests that GST activity was positively correlated with Hg, As and Se concentrations. The activity of the enzyme was also explained by the frequency of consumption of marine fish and shellfish in the diet of the breastfeeding women.

The levels of contaminants in the samples from the official control were below maximum limits from EU regulations with only a few exceptions in the following groups; dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) in fish-containing byproducts and dioxins in vegetable and animal fat, hydrogen cyanide in linseed, and cadmium in sunflowers. The levels of pesticides and mycotoxins in the additionally collected samples were below maximum limits. Enniatin B (ENN B) was present in all DDGS samples. The hypothetical cases of carry-over of contamination from these byproducts were designed assuming total absorption and accumulation of the ingested contaminant in meat and milk and high exposure (a byproduct formed 15-20% of the feed ration depending on the species). The risk assessment was refined based on literature data on metabolism in relevant animal species. Risk assessment of contaminants in byproducts is generally based on a worst-case approach, as data on carry-over of a contaminant are sparse. This may lead to erroneous estimation of health hazards. The presence of ENN B in all samples of DDGS indicates that potential impact of this emerging mycotoxin on feed and food safety deserves attention.

In this work, we prepared a dual-emission fluorescent probe for Hg(2+) detection by combining two lanthanide chelates with different emission wavelengths. Green-emitting terbium (Tb(3+)) chelates as reference signals were embedded into SiO2 nanoparticles and red-emitting europium (Eu(3+)) chelates as response units were covalently linked to the surface of silica shell. Upon the addition of Hg(2+), the fluorescence of Eu(3+) chelates can be selectively quenched, while the fluorescence of Tb(3+) chelates remained unchanged. As a kind of Hg(2+) nanosensor, the dual-emission fluorescent probe exhibited excellent selectivity to Hg(2+) and high sensitivity up to 7.07 nM detection limit.

Variables affecting HS-SPME and MHS-SPME were optimized to attain adequate sensitivity while allowing correct application of the MHS method. Thus, the MHS-SPME method was successfully performed when using 0.3g of cheese and 1 mL of NaCl (sat. solution), which is subjected to four consecutive extractions using the carboxen-polydimethylsyloxane (CAR-PDMS) as the commercial SPME coating, 40 min of HS extraction time at 45°C, and 6 min of desorption time in the GC injector at 290°C. The MHS-SPME permitted the calculation of β values, which range from 0.72±0.01-0.95±0.02, depending on the cheese studied. Later, this β parameter is used to perform quantitation for the 9 volatile FFAs after just a single HS-SPME extraction, using an external solvent calibration curve. The validity of the utilization of an external solvent calibration was tested with aqueous standards of volatile FFAs, getting average recoveries higher than 81.2%. Quantitation by MHS-SPME was free of matrix interferences despite measuring a complex cheese sample. The optimized method was validated, presenting inter-day reproducibility values (as RSD in %) lower than 13%, and limits of detection down to 7 µg kg(-1). The method was also compared with a conventional extraction method such as solid-phase extraction for the studied cheeses elaborated with goat milk, generating comparable results.

Principal component analysis showed that selected foodstuffs were the possible sources of metal contamination in human blood, while correlation analysis revealed that the concentrations of Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in foodstuffs significantly correlated with that in human blood. Moreover, risk assessments for individual metals via foodstuffs were found within safe limits, except for Cd (HQ>1); Whereas, for aggregate multiple metals the risk was calculated as 3.97E+00 (HI>1), in which water and milk were perceived as the greater contributors (81 percent) to HI; while fruits, grains and vegetables contributed 5 percent each, and pulses 4 percent.

Plate counts revealed that cheese manufacture affected the microbial ecology. The results agreed with those from culture-independent approaches. As shown by urea-PAGE, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and free-amino-acid (FAA) analyses, the extent of secondary proteolysis mainly increased after 30 to 45 days of ripening. VOCs and volatile free fatty acids (VFFA) were identified by a purge-and-trap method (PT) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. Except for aldehydes, the levels of most of VOCs and VFFA mainly increased from 30 to 45 days onwards. As shown through pyrosequencing analysis, raw cows' milk was contaminated by Firmicutes (53%), Proteobacteria (39%), Bacteroidetes (7.8%), Actinobacteria (0.06%), and Fusobacteria (0.03%), with heterogeneity at the genus level. The primary starter Streptococcus thermophilus dominated the curd population. Other genera occurred at low incidence or sporadically. The microbial dynamics reflected on the overall physiological diversity. At 30 days, a microbial succession was clearly highlighted. The relative abundance of Streptococcus sp. and especially St. thermophilus decreased, while that of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sp., and especially Lactobacillus paracasei increased consistently. Despite the lower relative abundance compared to St. thermophilus, mesophilic lactobacilli were the only organisms positively correlated with the concentration of FAAs, area of hydrophilic peptide peaks, and several VOCs (e.g., alcohols, ketones, esters and all furans).

High performance liquid chromatography coupled to UV-Vis and mass spectrometry detection as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been used to analyze BCMs in dairy products. BCMs have been detected in raw cow's milk and human milk and a variety of commercial cheeses, but their presence has yet to be confirmed in commercial yoghurts. The finding that BCMs are present in cheese suggests they could also form in yoghurt, but be degraded during yoghurt processing.

In the last few decades some methods described direct derivatization procedures bypassing these steps. They involve the utilization of methanolic HCL or BF3 as catalysts, but several evidences from previous works suggest these reagents are unstable, lead to the formation of artifacts and alter the distribution of specific compounds as hydroxy fatty acids or CLA. However, the main issue is that they are excellent esterification reagents but poor in transterification, being not suitable for the analysis of all lipid classes and leading to erroneous composition quantitations. The present research work is a comprehensive comparison of six general methylation protocols using base, acid or base/acid catalysts plus a proposed method in the analysis of total fatty acids in lipid standards mixtures, foodstuff and biological samples. The addition of aprotic solvents to the reaction mixture to avoid alterations was also tested. Results confirmed that procedures solely involving acid catalyst resulted in incomplete derivatizations and alteration of the fatty acid profile, partially corrected by addition of the aprotic solvent. The proposed method combining sodium methoxyde and sulfuric acid showed absence of alteration of the FAME profile and the best values for response factors (short chain fatty acids to PUFA), accuracy in the determination of total cholesterol and derivatization performance, thus showing a high reliability in the determination of the total fatty acid composition in biological samples and foods.

NIR reflectance spectra (1700-2500 nm) were converted to pseudoabsorbance and examined using (a) analysis of variance-principal component analysis (ANOVA-PCA), (b) pooled-ANOVA based on data submatrices, and (c) partial least-squares regression (PLSR) coupled with pooled-ANOVA. ANOVA-PCA score plots showed clear separation of the samples with respect to milk class (SMP or NFDM), day of analysis, production site, processing temperature, and individual samples. Pooled-ANOVA provided statistical levels of significance for the separation of the averages, some of which were many orders of magnitude below 10⁻³.

Accidental feeding of aflatoxin-contaminated rice straw may be detrimental for ruminant livestock and can lead to transmission of this toxin or its metabolites into the milk of dairy cattle. White-rot basidiomycetous fungus Pleurotus ostreatus produces ligninolytic enzymes like laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP). These extracellular enzymes have been reported to degrade many environmentally hazardous compounds. The present study examines the ability of P. ostreatus strains to degrade AFB1 in rice straw in the presence of metal salts and surfactants. Laccase and MnP activities were determined spectrophotometrically. The efficiency of AFB1 degradation was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography. Highest degradation was recorded for both P. ostreatus MTCC 142 (89.14 %) and P. ostreatus GHBBF10 (91.76 %) at 0.5 µg mL(-1) initial concentration of AFB1. Enhanced degradation was noted for P. ostreatus MTCC 142 in the presence of Cu(2+) and Triton X-100, at toxin concentration of 5 µg mL(-1).

The method has been shown to be estrogen specific, repeatable and reproducible, with covariance values below 20%. In conclusion, this method enables the detection of low levels of estrogen hormonal activity in milk with a detection capability of 36 pg g(-)(1) EEQ and has been successfully applied in testing a range of milk samples.",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"['D000818', 'D002460', 'D052244', 'D005506', 'D017930', 'D006801', 'D057230', 'D059625', 'D008156', 'D008892', 'D015203', 'D012680']","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Food Contamination', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Limit of Detection', 'Liquid-Liquid Extraction', 'Luciferases', 'Milk', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",Validation and application of a reporter gene assay for the determination of estrogenic endocrine disruptor activity in milk.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769019,2015
24766184,"A method for the analysis of phytostanyl fatty acid esters, the functional ingredients of cholesterol-lowering enriched foods, was developed. The procedure is based on (i) separation of the intact esters via reversed-phase ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography; (ii) detection by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry; and (iii) quantitation using selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Employing a C8 column, phytostanyl fatty acid esters sharing the same stanol nucleus could be separated according to the esterified fatty acids while esters with different stanol moieties could be distinguished via SIM based on the formation of an intense fragment ion [M - fatty acid + H](+). The suitability of the approach was demonstrated using different types of enriched foods reflecting the diversity in potential matrices (skimmed milk drinking yogurt, margarine, and soft-cheese-style spread). The developed methodology extends the analytical basis for authenticity and quality assessments of functional foods enriched with phytostanyl fatty acid esters.

24738917,"Diacetyl possesses a butter-like flavor and has been widely used as a flavoring agent. It forms from sugars and lipids via various bacteria and heat treatment in various foods and beverages, such as milk. The toxicity of diacetyl, especially when inhaled, has recently attracted the attention not only of consumers but also of regulatory agencies. Even though accurate quantitative analysis of diacetyl is extremely important in evaluating its possible adverse effects, precise quantitative analysis of diacetyl in foods and beverages, as well as in ambient air, is considerably difficult because it is highly reactive and soluble in water. Among the many analytical methods developed for measuring diacetyl, preparation of 2,3-dimethylquinoxaline followed by gas chromatography has been most commonly used in the analysis of various foods, beverages, and air samples.

24731621,"Studies of protein nutrition and biochemistry require reliable methods for analysis of amino acid (AA) composition in polypeptides of animal tissues and foods. Proteins are hydrolyzed by 6M HCl (110°C for 24h), 4.2M NaOH (105°C for 20 h), or proteases. Analytical techniques that require high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) include pre-column derivatization with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan, 9-fluorenyl methylchloroformate, phenylisothiocyanate, naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde, 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate, and o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA). OPA reacts with primary AA (except cysteine or cystine) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol or 3-mercaptopropionic acid to form a highly fluorescent adduct. OPA also reacts with 4-amino-1-butanol and 4-aminobutane-1,3-diol produced from oxidation of proline and 4-hydroxyproline, respectively, in the presence of chloramine-T plus sodium borohydride at 60°C, or with S-carboxymethyl-cysteine formed from cysteine and iodoacetic acid at 25°C. Fluorescence of OPA derivatives is monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 455 nm, respectively. Detection limits are 50 fmol for AA. This technique offers the following advantages: simple procedures for preparation of samples, reagents, and mobile-phase solutions; rapid pre-column formation of OPA-AA derivatives and their efficient separation at room temperature (e.g., 20-25°C); high sensitivity of detection; easy automation on the HPLC apparatus; few interfering side reactions; a stable chromatography baseline for accurate integration of peak areas; and rapid regeneration of guard and analytical columns. Thus, the OPA method provides a useful tool to determine AA composition in proteins of animal tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle, liver, intestine, placenta, brain, and body homogenates) and foods (e.g., milk, corn grain, meat, and soybean meal).","Journal of chromatography.

Ca, Mg, Zn and Fe concentrations were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer, while F levels using a potentiometric method. F levels in the examined formula samples increased with the intended age range, until the intended age of 1 year, and then decreased. A lower content of Ca, Mg and Zn was observed in formulas intended for children <1 year of age and higher for older children. Fe content increased with the age range. A statistically significant higher content of Ca, Mg, Zn and Fe in samples intended for children with phenylketonuria in comparison to those intended for healthy children or children with food allergies was noted. The content of the analysed elements in juices and nectars showed the highest contents in products intended for infants (under 6 months of age). The lowest levels of elements tested were found in drinks for children over 6 months of age. In conclusion, the concentrations of the examined elements in infant formulas and juices for children were decidedly greater than the standards for the individual age groups.

These emerging contaminants have recently become of concern for human health because of their potential negative effects. The risk of exposure to PFAS for humans is mainly related to diet, and the increasing interest in food safety has led the European Commission to call Member States to monitor these contaminants in food matrices. The purpose of the present work was to perform the first monitoring on the presence of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the 2 main and most widely investigated molecules of this family, in cow milk commercially available in Italy. We used an analytical protocol consisting of liquid-liquid extraction followed by 2 purification steps through solid-phase extraction cartridges and injection on an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy system. The analysis of 67 samples of different types of cow milk from Italy demonstrated that contamination by PFOS was often present, although at relatively low concentrations (up to 97 ng/L), whereas PFOA was rarely found. On the basis of these results and data reported in the literature on this matrix, milk does not seem to be a major source of PFAS compared with other food categories such as fish and seafood.

The strains belonged to Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Streptococcus thermophilus. LAB were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (WBM) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in WBM and raw milk. The strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a pH drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. After 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in pH values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris PON153, Ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides PON259 and PON559 increased their number during the 15days at 7°C. A sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (PDO) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. Thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS). The dominance of lactococci over thermophilic LAB of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of VOC profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain Lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of Vastedda-like cheese.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D005516', 'D006094', 'D006801', 'D006863', 'D048668', 'D013294', 'D007934', 'D008892', 'D019105', 'D012621', 'D048249', 'D013649', 'D013696', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Food Microbiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactobacillus delbrueckii', 'Lactococcus lactis', 'Leuconostoc', 'Milk', 'Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique', 'Seasons', 'Streptococcus thermophilus', 'Taste', 'Temperature', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",In vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000382', None, None, 'Q000502', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, 'genetics', None, None, 'physiology', 'physiology', 'physiology', 'microbiology', None, None, 'physiology', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598514,2014

In this study, the interaction between different proteolytic strains of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was investigated in terms of microbial growth, acidification and changes in the biochemical composition of milk during set-yoghurt fermentation. A complementary metabolomics approach was applied for global characterization of volatile and non-volatile polar metabolite profiles of yoghurt associated with proteolytic activity of the individual strains in the starter cultures. The results demonstrated that only non-proteolytic S. thermophilus (Prt-) strain performed proto-cooperation with L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.

Commonly, CMP is analyzed by reversed phase (RP-HPLC) or size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). However, some psychrotropic microorganisms - specially Pseudomonas fluorescens - when present in storaged milk, can produce, by enzymatic pathway, a CMP-like peptide generally called pseudo-CMP. These two peptides differ from each other only by one amino acid. RP-HPLC and SEC methods are unable to distinguish these two peptides, which demand development of a confirmatory method with high selectivity.

There exists little scientific validation of the actual effects of these treatments on methyl ketone development. The present study evaluated the effects of milk fat homogenization and lipase treatments on methyl ketone and free fatty acid development using sensory methods and the comparison of selected volatile quantities using gas chromatography. Initial work was conducted using a blue cheese system model; subsequent work was conducted with manufactured blue cheese. In general, there were modest effects of homogenization and lipase treatments on free fatty acid (FFA) and methyl ketone concentrations in blue cheese. Blue cheese treatments involving Penicillium roqueforti lipase with homogenized milk yielded higher FFA and methyl ketone levels, for example, a ∼20-fold increase for hexanoic acid and a 3-fold increase in 2-pentanone.

With the exception of pH, there were no significant differences in gross composition between MCE-cheese (MCE-C) and CAR-cheese (CAR-C). The pH value of CAR-C was significantly higher than that of MCE-C at 40 and 60 d of ripening. The total nitrogen content of the pH 4.6-soluble fraction obtained from MCE-C was higher than that obtained from CAR-C. However, nitrogen content of the 12% TCA-soluble fraction was similar between CAR-C and MCE-C. The extent of α(s1)-casein and β-casein hydrolysis, measured by urea-PAGE, was similar in both cheese samples. The hydrolysis of β-casein was lower than that of α(s1)-casein. Different reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatography peptide profiles of ethanol-soluble and ethanol-insoluble fractions were obtained from CAR-C and MCE-C. The peptide content in the 2 cheese samples increased throughout ripening; the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic peptides was lower in MCE-C than in CAR-C.

Therefore, a sensitive method for determination of these components was established, a simple separation of the dissolved analytes from the matrix, followed by headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS/MS). This is the first approach for simultaneous determination of caffeine, myosmine, and nicotine with a convenient SPME technique. Calibration curves were linear for the xanthine alkaloid (250 to 3000 mg/kg) and the pyridine alkaloids (0.000125 to 0.003000 mg/kg). Residuals of the calibration curves were lower than 15%, hence the limits of detection were set as the lowest points of the calibration curves. The limits of detection calculated from linearity data were for caffeine 216 mg/kg, for myosmine 0.000110 mg/kg, and for nicotine 0.000120 mg/kg. Thirty samples of 5 chocolate brands with varying cocoa contents (30% to 99%) were analyzed in triplicate.

24438753,"This study was designed to assess the value of seaweeds from the Galician coast as a source of minerals (especially iodine (I) but also other micro-minerals) in organic dairy cattle. It was conducted in an organic dairy farm in the Lugo province that typically represents the organic milk production in NW Spain. The animal's diet consisted mainly of local forage (at pasture or as hay and silage in the winter) and 5 kg of purchased concentrate/day per animal (representing 23.5% of feed intake). Based on the mineral composition of the diet, the physiological requirements and the EU maximum authorised levels in feed, a supplement composed by Sea Lettuce (Ulva rigida) (as flakes, 80%), Japanese Wireweed (Sargasum muticum) (flakes, 17.5%) and Furbelows (Saccorhiza polyschides) (powder, 2.5%) was formulated to give 100 g/animal per day. Sixteen Holstein Friesian lactating cows were randomly selected and assigned to the control (n=8) and algae-supplemented groups (n=8). Both groups had exactly the same feeding and management with the exception of the algae supplement, which was mixed with the concentrate feed and given to the animals at their morning milking for 10 weeks. Heparinised blood (for plasma analysis) and milk samples were collected at 2-week intervals and analysed for toxic and trace element concentrations by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry or inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The algae supplement significantly improved the animals' mineral status, particularly I and selenium that were low on the farm. However, the effect of the algae supplement on the molybdenum status in cattle needs further investigation because of its great relevance on copper metabolism in ruminants. The I supply deserves special attention, since this element is at a very high concentration in brown-algae species and it is excreted in the milk proportionally to its concentration in plasma concentrations (mean ± s.e. in the algae-supplemented and control groups were 268 ± 54 and 180 ± 42 µg/l, respectively).",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,"['D000821', 'D000824', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D003612', 'D004032', 'D019587', 'D005260', 'D058870', 'D007774', 'D008892', 'D011897', 'D012624', 'D012820', 'D013030']","['Animal Feed', 'Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Dairying', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Food, Organic', 'Lactation', 'Milk', 'Random Allocation', 'Seaweed', 'Silage', 'Spain']",The use of seaweed from the Galician coast as a mineral supplement in organic dairy cattle.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000662', None, None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', None, None, 'physiology', None, 'veterinary', None, None, None, 'physiology', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24438753,2015

24282953,"An automated sample preparation technique involving cleanup and analytical separation in a single operation using an online coupled TurboFlow (RP-LC system) is reported. This method eliminates time-consuming sample preparation steps that can be potential sources for cross-contamination in the analysis of plasticizers. Using TurboFlow chromatography, liquid samples were injected directly into the automated system without previous extraction or cleanup. Special cleanup columns enabled specific binding of target compounds; higher MW compounds, i.e., fats and proteins, and other matrix interferences with different chemical properties were removed to waste, prior to LC/MS/MS. Systematic stepwise method development using this new technology in the food safety area is described. Selection of optimum columns and mobile phases for loading onto the cleanup column followed by transfer onto the analytical column and MS detection are critical method parameters.

The results showed that when the amounts of EOPO (80%, w/w) and K2HPO4 (55%, w/w) were 3.0 mL, 7.0 mL, respectively, pH=11, the extraction efficiency of CIP could reach 97.7%. In the second extraction, with the temperature induced, the extraction efficiency of CIP showed 85.6%.

24262000,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high-production-volume chemical that is widely used in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy food-can coatings. Following several studies that have reported adverse effects of BPA over the past decade, other bisphenol analogues, such as bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol AF (BPAF), and bisphenol B (BPB), have been gradually developed as substitutes for BPA in several applications. Nevertheless, few studies have reported on the occurrence of compounds other than BPA in foodstuffs. In this study, 289 food samples (13 categories: cereals and cereal products, meat and meat products, fish and seafood, eggs, milk and milk products, bean products, fruits, vegetables, cookies/snacks, beverages, cooking oils, condiments, and others), collected from nine cities in China, were analysed for eight bisphenol analogues using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). BPA and BPF were found widely in foodstuffs at concentrations ranging from below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) to 299 ng g(-1) (mean = 4.94 ng g(-1)) and from below the LOQ to 623 ng g(-1) (mean = 2.50 ng g(-1)), fresh weight, respectively. The highest total concentrations of bisphenols (∑BPs: sum of eight bisphenols) were found in the category of vegetables that included canned products (mean = 27.0 ng g(-1)), followed by fish and seafood (16.5 ng g(-1)) and beverages (15.6 ng g(-1)). ∑BP concentrations (mean = 2-3 ng g(-1)) in milk and milk products, cooking oils, and eggs were low. Food samples sold in metallic cans contained higher mean ∑BP concentrations (56.9 ng g(-1)) in comparison with those packaged in glass (0.43 ng g(-1)), paper (11.9 ng g(-1)), or plastic (6.40 ng g(-1)). The daily dietary intakes of bisphenols were estimated, based on the mean concentrations measured and daily consumption rates of foods, to be 646 and 664 ng kg(-1) bw day(-1) for men and women, respectively.","Food additives & contaminants.

24196216,"In this work, the hypothesis of a possible dietary effect on the isotopic composition of Zn in blood from populations with different feeding habits, i.e. lacto-ovo vegetarians and omnivores, was investigated through isotopic analysis of Zn in common food products by multi-collector ICP - mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Several certified reference materials (CRMs) were also included in the sample set for comparison purposes. For these CRMs, the isotopic composition of Zn is expressed as δ-values, calculated with respect to both IRMM-3702 and JMC-ZnLyon, as isotopic standards. The range of δ(66)Zn values observed in food products was approximately 1.9‰. In general, vegetables, cereals and derived products showed an enrichment of the heavier Zn isotopes, whereas a depletion was observed in products of animal origin (meat, fish, egg and semi-skimmed milk), relative to human blood samples. Mussel, however, showed a significant enrichment of the heavier isotopes, which is hypothetically attributed to its accumulation behaviour. Thus, the lower δ(66)Zn values found in food products of animal origin appear to be reflected in the lower δ(66)Zn value observed in blood from an omnivorous population compared to that for a vegetarian population.

24190289,"A reliable quantitative determination method of sugar alcohols, D-mannitol, xylitol and D-sorbitol, in food samples by HPLC, and a simple confirmation method by LC-MS were developed. Quantitative HPLC analysis was performed using a separation column packed with polystyrene cation exchange resin of sulfonic acid type, and with pure distilled water as the mobile phase. This column, operated at 0.85 mL/min flow rate of mobile phase and 50℃ column oven temperature, completely separated the three sugar alcohols. Further, these three sugar alcohols were well separated from erythritol and other sugars (sucrose, D-glucose, D-xylose and D-fructose). Recoveries of the three sugar alcohols spiked into food samples, such as orange juice, yogurt, chewing gum and milk, exceeded 91% and the values of coefficient of variance were below 3.1%. A triple extraction process with 80% ethanol was needed for biscuit to achieve recoveries exceeding 82%. LC-MS was carried out on a NH2 column with acetonitrile-water (9 : 1) as the mobile phase, and this afforded partial but acceptable separation of the three sugar alcohols with in 10 minutes. Ion peaks derived from [M-H](-) and [M+Cl](-) were clearly detected for all three sugar alcohols in the negative electrospray inization mode at 30 V cone voltage. The positive electrospray ionization mode produced the ions [M+Na](+) and [M+Na+CH3CN](+). These characteristic ions served to confirm the presence of the sugar alcohols in food samples.

UA-DLLME was optimized as less solvent-consuming and cost-effective extraction method for water, fruit juice, milk and soy milk samples. The effect of parameters such as the type and volume of extraction solvent, the type and volume of dispersive solvent, amount of derivatization agent, temperature, pH of sample and ionic strength was investigated and optimized for each specimen, using experimental designs. By adding acetonitrile as dispersive solvent, N-heptafluorobutyrylimizadole (HFBI) as derivatization agent and chloroform as extraction solvent, the extraction-derivatization and preconcentration were simultaneously performed. The analytical concentration range was investigated in detail for each analyte in the different samples, obtaining linearity with R(2) ranging between 0.9990 and 0.9999. The method detection limits were in the range of 0.2-1.8μgL(-1) (water), 0.5-15μgL(-1) (fruit juices) and 0.9-3.6μgkg(-1) (milk) and 0.1-1.0μgkg(-1) (soy milk). The method was applied to the analysis of a variety of specimens, with recoveries of 98-101% from water, 97-102% from juices, 99-103% from milk and 97-105% from soy beverage. The relative standard deviation (precision, n=6) varied between 1.3 and 4.9%RSD in water, 2.3 and 5.8%RSD in juices, 1.0 and 5.7%RSD in milk and 3.9 and 9.3%RSD in soy milk.

The non-EPS-producing isogenic variant Streptococcus thermophilus ST042 was used for making full-fat Caciotta-type cheese (FFC), LFC, and LFC-MWPC. Cheeses were characterized based on compositional, microbiological, biochemical, texture, volatile components (purge and trap, and solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), and sensory analyses. Compared with FFC and LFC (51.6 ± 0.7 to 53.0 ± 0.9%), the other cheese variants retained higher levels of moisture (60.5 ± 1.1 to 67.5 ± 0.5%). The MWPC mainly contributed to moisture retention. Overall, all LFC had approximately one-fourth (22.6 ± 0.8%) of the fat of FFC. Hardness of cheeses slightly varied over 7d of ripening. Microbial EPS positively affected cheese texture, and the texture of LFC without MWPC or microbial EPS was excessively firm. Free amino acids were at the highest levels in LFC treatments (2,705.8 ± 122 to 3,070.4 ± 123 mg/kg) due to the addition of MWPC and the peptidase activity of adjunct cultures.

Linear responses for BCM5 and BCM7 (R(2)=0.9985 and 0.9986, respectively) was observed in the range 0.01-10ng/μL. The method limits of detection (MLDs) in yoghurt extracts were found to be 0.5 and 0.25ng/g for BCM5 and BCM7, respectively.

Recoveries relative to the surrogate standards of these spikes were in the range of 95-106% for BCM5 and 103-109% for BCM7. Precision from analysis of spiked samples was expressed as relative standard deviation (%RSD) and values were in the range 1-16% for BCM5 and 1-6% for BCM7.

24107131,"This study summarises the results of the levels of 21 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in 50 selected pooled samples representing 15 food commodities with the special focus on those of animal origin, as meat, seafood, fish, milk, dairy products and hen eggs, which are commonly consumed in various European markets, e.g. Czech, Italian, Belgian and Norwegian. A new, rapid sample preparation approach based on the QuEChERS extraction procedure was applied. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) employing electrospray ionisation (ESI) in negative mode was used for the quantification of target analytes. Method quantification limits (MQLs) were in the range of 1-10 ng kg(-1) (ng l(-1)) for fish, meat, hen eggs, cheese and milk, and in the range of 2.5-125 ng kg(-1) for butter. Only 16 of the group of 21 PFASs were found in at least one analysed sample. From 16 PFASs, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most frequently detected analyte present in approximately 50% of samples (in the range of 0.98-2600 ng kg(-1)). PFCAs with C8-C14 carbon chain were presented in approximately 20% of samples. The concentration ranges of individual compounds in the respective groups of PFASs were: 2.33-76.3 ng kg(-1) for PFSAs (without PFOS), 4.99-961 ng kg(-1) for PFCAs, 10.6-95.4 ng kg(-1) for PFPAs, and 1.61-519 ng kg(-1) for FOSA. The contamination level in the analysed food commodities decreased in the following order: seafood > pig/bovine liver >> freshwater/marine fish > hen egg > meat >> butter. When comparing the total contamination and profiles of PFASs in food commodities that originated from various sampling countries, differences were identified, and the contents decreased as follows: Belgium >> Norway, Italy > Czech Republic.

In the current study, a simple and rapid proteomics-based MALDI-TOF MS approach was developed to detect L. monocytogenes directly from selective enrichment broths. Milk samples spiked with single species and multiple species cultures were incubated in a selective enrichment broth for 24h, followed by an additional 6h secondary enrichment. As few as 1 colony-forming unit (cfu) of L. monocytogenes per mL of initial selective broth culture could be detected within 30h. On applying the same approach to solid foods previously implicated in listeriosis, namely chicken pâté, cantaloupe and Camembert cheese, detection was achieved within the same time interval at inoculation levels of 10cfu/mL.

The purpose of this observational study was to assess the potential relationship between human breast milk sialic acid levels and dietary nutrition intake 40 d postpartum. The study population included 90 healthy women who were lactating. Human breast milk SA concentrations were measured using fluorescence detector-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-FLD) analysis and nutritional intake was estimated by a computerized validated food frequency questionnaire. SA in human breast milk was bound to free oligosaccharides (82.35%), protein (15.27%) and free sialic acid (2.37%). The findings of this study indicate that subjects with higher milk SA levels showed statistically higher levels of vitamin A compared with subjects with lower SA levels (423.48±172.29 vs. 602.22±126.46 μg/d, p=0.000). In addition, there was a certain association (standardized coefficients=0.713; p=0.000) between breast milk SA and vitamin A intake in healthy young subjects. This study demonstrated that dietary vitamin A intake has a certain relationship with breast milk SA concentrations. This may be attributed to the influence of vitamin A on sialic acid glycoprotein and sialic acid mucopolysaccharide in the human body or the common food sources for vitamin A and sialic acid.

23949006,"Aflatoxin-producing fungi contaminate food and feed during pre-harvest, storage and processing periods. Once consumed, aflatoxins (AFs) accumulate in tissues, causing illnesses in animals and humans. Most human exposure to AF seems to be a result of consumption of contaminated plant and animal products. The policy of blending and dilution of grain containing higher levels of aflatoxins with uncontaminated grains for use in animal feed implicitly assumes that the deleterious effects of low levels of the toxins are linearly correlated to concentration. This assumption may not be justified, since it involves extrapolation of these nontoxic levels in feed, which are not of further concern. To develop a better understanding of the significance of low dose effects, in the present study, we developed quantitative methods for the detection of biologically active aflatoxin B₁ (AFB1) in Vero cells by two independent assays: the green fluorescent protein (GFP) assay, as a measure of protein synthesis by the cells, and the microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay, as a measure of cell viability. The results demonstrate a non-linear dose-response relationship at the cellular level. AFB1 at low concentrations has an opposite biological effect to higher doses that inhibit protein synthesis. Additional studies showed that heat does not affect the stability of AFB1 in milk and that the Vero cell model can be used to determine the presence of bioactive AFB1 in spiked beef, lamb and turkey meat.

23891373,"Laboratories focusing on residue analysis in food are continuously seeking to increase sample throughput by minimizing sample preparation. Generic sample extraction methods such as QuEChERS lack selectivity and consequently extracts are not free from non-volatile material that contaminates the analytical system. Co-extracted matrix constituents interfere with target analytes, even if highly sensitive and selective GC-MS/MS is used. A number of GC approaches are described that can be used to increase laboratory productivity. These techniques include automated inlet liner exchange and column backflushing for preservation of the performance of the analytical system and heart-cutting two-dimensional GC for increasing sensitivity and selectivity. The application of these tools is illustrated by the analysis of pesticides in vegetables and fruits, PCBs in milk powder and coplanar PCBs in fish. It is demonstrated that considerable increase in productivity can be achieved by decreasing instrument down-time, while analytical performance is equal or better compared to conventional trace contaminant analysis.

23859835,"Hydroxytyrosol (HXT) has been reported to have beneficial effects for human health, such as antioxidant and antimicrobial properties and an important contribution to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Hence, exhaustive research is currently being performed to prepare functional foods, such as tomato juice or milk, with HXT. This paper presents a multi-commutated flow method based on the quenching effect that HXT has on the fluorescence of water-soluble mercaptopropionic acid-capped CdTe quantum dots. Under optimal conditions a linear working range was obtained for concentrations between 10 and 250 ng µl⁻¹. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed method for the determination of HXT, HXT-enriched samples were prepared. Using a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) procedure for extraction, HXT was determined in the prepared functional foods (milk, infant formula, tomato juice and tomato soup). Recoveries of 100% ± 8%, relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 5% and high sample throughput of 70 samples per h show the potential of the system for the analysis of HXT in food samples.","Food additives & contaminants.

23849637,"Sour cream is a widely popular acidified dairy product. Volatile compounds and organic acids and their specific contributions to flavor or acceptance have not been established, nor has a comprehensive study been conducted to characterize drivers of liking for sour cream. The objective of this study was to characterize chemical and sensory properties of sour cream and to determine the drivers of liking for sour cream. Descriptive sensory and instrumental analyses followed by consumer testing were conducted. Flavor and texture attributes of 32 (22 full-fat, 6 reduced-fat, and 4 fat-free) commercial sour creams were evaluated by a trained descriptive sensory panel. Percent solids, percent fat, pH, titratable acidity, and colorimetric measurements were conducted to characterize physical properties of sour creams. Organic acids were evaluated by HPLC and volatile aroma active compounds were evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with gas chromatography-olfactometry. Consumer acceptance testing (n=201) was conducted on selected sour creams, followed by external preference mapping. Full-fat sour creams were characterized by the lack of surface gloss and chalky textural attributes, whereas reduced-fat and fat-free samples displayed high intensities of these attributes. Full-fat sour creams were higher in cooked/milky and milk fat flavors than the reduced-fat and fat-free samples. Reduced-fat and fat-free sour creams were characterized by cardboard, acetaldehyde/green, and potato flavors, bitter taste, and astringency. Lactic acid was the prominent organic acid in all sour creams, followed by acetic and citric acids. High aroma-impact volatile compounds in sour creams were 2,3-butanedione, acetic acid, butyric acid, octanal, 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, 1-octene-3-one, and acetaldehyde. Positive drivers of liking for sour cream were milk fat, cooked/milky and sweet aromatic flavors, opacity, color intensity, and adhesiveness.

Recoveries were greater than 79% for all PAHs analysed. Reproducible determination with adequate detection and quantification limits (LOD and LOQ) were attained by HPLC with fluorescence detection for 14 PAHs. Acenaphthylene was determined with a UV-VIS detector. There is no significant difference in any PAHs or in the sum of them between the Argentinean and Brazilian samples. Therefore, the samples were evaluated together. The highest concentration of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) detected was 0.57 µg kg⁻¹ in milk powder. Contamination of samples expressed as the sum of 15 analysed PAHs varied between 11.8 and 78.4 µg kg⁻¹ and as PAH4 (BaP, chrysene, benzo(a)anthracene and benzo(b)fluoranthene) was between 0.02 and 10.16 µg kg⁻¹. The correlation coefficient for PAH2 (BaP and chrysene) and PAH4 groups was 0.95, for PAH2 and PAH8 it was 0.71, and for PAH4 and PAH8 it was 0.83. All the samples were below the regulatory limit for BaP, but 65% of commercial milk powders do not comply with the European Union limit for PAH4.

Although a large number of metals are introduced to the water bodies during their mining and extraction processes and geochemical weathering of rocks, but the role of domestic and industrial wastes is predominant and of much concern.

Human activities and large number of small and big industrial units are increasingly discharging deleterious metals present in the effluents and wastes, to the environment and aquatic systems and have contaminated heavily even the ground water. The toxic metals have a great tendency of bioaccumulation through which they enter the food chain system and ultimately affect adversely the life on this planet Earth in various ways.

In addition, these are of great concern to prestigious Manchego cheese processors (Central Spain denomination of origin) because they reduce the curdling of milk and cause improper cheese ripening, which consequently lead to an important loss of monetary income. This work describes the development of a sensitive and reliable method using liquid chromatography with UV-diode array detection (LC-DAD) for simultaneous determination of the β-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin (AMP), benzylpenicillin (PEG), cephalexin (CFX), cefazolin (CFL), cefoperazone (CFP), cloxacillin (CLO), dicloxacillin (DCL), oxacillin (OXA) and phenoxymethylpenicillin (PEV), in Manchega ewe milk. The column, mobile phase, temperature and flow rate were optimised to provide the best resolution of these analytes. The extraction method of the antibiotic residues involves the deproteinisation of the milk sample using acetonitrile and centrifugation followed by a solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up. The recoveries for the studied β-lactams ranged from 79% to 96% with relative standard deviations between 0.5% and 4.9%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) for all these compounds were in the range of 3.4-8.6μgkg(-1), which are lower than the maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the European Union for the studied β-lactams in milk, making the method suitable for performing routine analyses. The proposed multi-residue LC-UV-diode array detection (LC-DAD) method is a powerful and popular alternative for the determination and confirmation of antibiotic residues in small milk industries and is the first one capable of determining nine β-lactam antibiotics in samples of Manchega ewe milk.

23548280,"Milk fat is encapsulated in a milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) that contains bioactive glycoproteins and glycolipids. The MFGM inhibits infectivity of rotavirus (RV), activity that has been attributed to its glycoprotein and carbohydrate components. However, previous studies of proteins and oligosaccharides in the MGFM have not accounted for all the bioactivity associated with the complete MFGM. The lipid fraction of the MFGM accounts for half of its composition by weight, and we postulate that this fraction should be tested by itself to determine if it plays a role in antiviral activity. Herein, the anti-RV activity of an organic extract of MFGM was tested. Natural and whey buttermilk powders containing bovine MFGM enriched in polar lipids were prepared by microfiltration and supercritical fluid extraction treatment to reduce the triglyceride content of the powders. Lipid fractions were then extracted from the MFGM using both single- and dual-phase extraction methods. Whole MFGM and organic extracts were screened in MA-104 cells for anti-infective activity against a neuraminidase-sensitive rotavirus using a focus-forming unit assay. Dose-dependent inhibition was observed for whole buttermilk and cheese whey MFGM against the rotavirus. In general, buttermilk MFGM exhibited greater RV percentage inhibition than cheese whey MFGM. Organic-soluble anti-RV compounds were identified in bovine MFGM. The most active fraction, isolated by dual-phase extraction and iatrobead chromatography, was free of proteins and highly nonpolar. Further separation of this fraction in a less polar solvent (30:1 chloroform:methanol) resolved at least 5 lipid-containing compounds, which likely contribute to the anti-RV activity associated with bovine MFGM. In summary, lipid components associated with MFGM appear to contribute in large part to the anti-RV activity associated with the bovine MFGM.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D000998', 'D002417', 'D043302', 'D057141', 'D006017', 'D006023', 'D066292', 'D008055', 'D008892', 'D012401']","['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Cattle', 'Cultured Milk Products', 'Food, Preserved', 'Glycolipids', 'Glycoproteins', 'Lipid Droplets', 'Lipids', 'Milk', 'Rotavirus']",Milk fat globule membrane isolated from buttermilk or whey cream and their lipid components inhibit infectivity of rotavirus in vitro.,"[None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000187']","[None, 'pharmacology', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23548280,2014

The effect of a milk formula consisting of antioxidant of bamboo leaves (AOB), vitamin C (Vc), calcium lactate (CaLac), ferrous sulfate (FeSO₄) and zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄) on the reduction of lead and lead-induced oxidative damage in lead-exposed mice was studied. The lead-reducing effect of milk formula was investigated via a 7-week toxicokinetics study and a tissue distribution level examination. The ameliorating effect of milk formula on lead-induced oxidative damage was investigated. Results demonstrated current milk formula could effectively reduce blood lead levels (BLLs) and lead distribution levels of liver, kidneys, thighbones and brain in mice based on metal ion-mediated antagonism and chelation mechanisms. This milk formula could not only protect lead-susceptible tissues against lead poisoning, but also maintain normal absorption and distribution of essential elements in vivo. Meanwhile, current milk formula could prevent the reduction of δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALAD) activity and enhancement of free erythrocyte protoporphyrins (FEP) levels in blood erythrocytes of mice.

23473534,"High fat dairy products, such as butter and margarine can be contaminated during the milk production process with a residue called Trichloromethane (TCM), which results from the use of chlorine based detergent solutions. Although, TCM concentrations in Irish products are not at levels that are a public health issue, such contamination can cause marketing difficulties in countries to which Irish products are being exported. In an attempt to reduce such milk residues, a template procedure was developed, tried and tested on 43 farms (from 3 processing companies). This involved identifying farms with high TCM milk, applying corrective action in the form of advice and recommendations to reduce TCM and re-measuring milks from these farms. Trichloromethane in milk was measured by head-space gas chromatography with electron capture detector. The TCM reduction strategy proved successful in significantly reducing the levels in milk in the farms tested, e.g. TCM was reduced from 0.006 to the target of 0.002 mg/kg (P < 0.05). The strategy was then applied to farms who supplied milk to six Irish dairy processors with the objective of reducing TCM in those milks to a level of ≤ 0.002 mg/kg. Initially, milk tankers containing milks from approximately 10-15 individual farms were sampled and analysed and tankers with high TCM (>0.002 mg/kg) identified. Individual herd milks contributing to these tankers were subsequently sampled and analysed and farms supplying high TCM identified. Guidance and advice was provided to the high TCM milk suppliers and levels of TCM of these milk supplies were monitored subsequently.

The ammonium salts evaluated were chloride, acetate, formate, carbonate, and sulfate. A mixture of NaCl and MgSO4, salts used in the well-known QuEChERS method, was also tested for comparison. With thermal decomposition/evaporation temperature of <350°C, ammonium salts resulted in negligible ion source residual under typical electrospray conditions, leading to consistent method performance and less instrument cleaning. Although all ammonium salts tested induced acetonitrile/water phase separation, NH4Cl yielded the best performance, thus it was the preferred salting out agent. The NH4Cl salting out method was successfully coupled with FI/MS/MS and tested for fourteen pesticide active ingredients: chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, chlorimuron ethyl, oxamyl, methomyl, sulfometuron methyl, chlorsulfuron, triflusulfuron methyl, azimsulfuron, flupyrsulfuron methyl, aminocyclopyrachlor, aminocyclopyrachlor methyl, diuron and hexazinone.

Milk from 2 goat breeds (Gokceada and Turkish Saanen) and different starter culture systems (no starter, mesophilic and thermophilic starters) were used in the manufacture of goat milk cheeses (called Gokceada goat cheese). Volatile composition was determined by a solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometric method. Sixty compounds including esters (13), carboxylic acids (7), aldehydes (6), ketones (8), alcohols (14), and miscellaneous compounds (12) were identified. Esters, alcohols, and carboxylic acids were the main classes of volatile components in the cheeses. Both qualitatively and quantitatively, the use of different starter cultures and goat breeds significantly influenced the volatile fraction of goat milk cheese. Decanoic, hexanoic, and octanoic (commonly named capric, caproic, and caprylic) acids were indicator compounds to distinguish the goat breeds. Principal component analysis grouped the cheeses based on the use of starter culture and goat breed.

23451369,"A colorimetric method for the determination of total antioxidant activity in a variety of foods and beverages was validated in both a single-laboratory validation and a collaborative laboratory validation study. The procedure involved extraction of the antioxidants directly into a methanol-water solution containing a known amount of 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), thus promoting the rapid reaction of extracted materials with DPPH. The reaction was monitored by spectrophotometric measurement of the absorbance loss at 517 nm. Antioxidant activity was quantified relative to a dilution series of vitamin E analog standards (Trolox), which were analyzed in parallel simultaneously with the food and beverage samples. The antioxidant activities of the samples ranged from 131 to 131 000 micromole Trolox equivalents/100 g. Statistical analysis of the results showed that nine of the 11 matrixes gave acceptable HorRat values, indicating that the method performed well in these cases. The acceptable matrixes include pomegranate juice, blueberry juice, carrot juice, green tea, wine, rosemary spice, ready-to-eat cereal, and yogurt.

23438683,"The consumer trend for healthier food choices and preferences for low-fat products has increased the interest in low-fat cheese and nutraceutical dairy products. However, consumer preference is still for delicious food. Low- and reduced-fat cheeses are not completely accepted because of their unappealing properties compared with full-fat cheeses. The method reported here provides another option to the conventional cheese-making process to obtain lower fat cheese. Using CO(2) as a supercritical fluid offers an alternative to reduce fat in cheese after ripening, while maintaining the initial characteristics and flavor. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of pressure (10, 20, 30, and 40 × 10(6) Pa) of supercritical CO(2) on the amount of fat extracted, microbial population, polar lipid profile, and microstructure of 2 varieties of goat cheese: Majorero, a protected denomination of origin cheese from Spain, and goat Gouda-type cheese. The amount of fat was reduced 50 to 57% and 48 to 55% for Majorero and goat Gouda-type cheeses, respectively. Higher contents (on a fat basis) of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine were found in Majorero cheese compared with control and goat Gouda-type cheeses. The microbial population was reduced after supercritical fluid extraction in both cheeses, and the lethality was higher as pressure increased in Majorero cheese, most noticeably on lactococcus and lactobacillus bacteria. The Gouda-type cheese did not contain any lactobacilli. Micrographs obtained from confocal laser scanning microscopy showed a more open matrix and whey pockets in the Majorero control cheese. This could explain the ease of extracting fat and reducing the microbial counts in this cheese after treatment with supercritical CO(2). Supercritical fluid extraction with CO(2) has great potential in the dairy industry and in commercial applications. The Majorero cheese obtained after the supercritical fluid extraction treatment was an excellent candidate as a low-fat goat cheese, lower in triglycerides and cholesterol but still with all the health benefits inherent in goat milk.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D058491', 'D002611', 'D025924', 'D063427', 'D005524', 'D006041', 'D008055', 'D011312']","['Animals', 'Bacterial Load', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid', 'Food Quality', 'Food Technology', 'Goats', 'Lipids', 'Pressure']","Effects of supercritical fluid extraction pressure on chemical composition, microbial population, polar lipid profile, and microstructure of goat cheese.","[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23438683,2013

The mycotoxins were detected by electrospray ionization in positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), achieving the separation in about 4min. Sample treatment consisted of a modified method based on a first step using a QuEChERS-based procedure which allowed the determination of fumonisin B1, fumonisin B2, nivalenol, deoxynivalenol and fusarenon-X, and a subsequent clean-up based on dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) for the determination of the rest of mycotoxins.

23295111,"Whey proteins that have been removed before the cheese-making process are referred to as ""native"" whey proteins or milk serum proteins. Because serum proteins isolated directly from milk are not exposed to the cheese-making process, they are free from functional or sensory effects arising from this process. Whey proteins used in food and beverage applications are largely derived from annatto-colored Cheddar cheese. Some of the annatto is left in the whey and this color is converted to a colorless compound by bleaching. The effect of bleaching serum proteins on flavor and functionality of spray-dried protein provides a platform to investigate the effect of bleaching free from the confounding effects of cheese manufacture. The objective of this study was to characterize and compare the sensory and functional properties of 80% milk serum protein concentrate (SPC80) produced from bleached and unbleached microfiltration (MF) permeate made from skim milk with and without added annatto color. Colored and uncolored MF permeates were bleached with benzoyl peroxide (BP) or hydrogen peroxide (HP), ultrafiltered, diafiltered, and spray-dried. The SPC80 from unbleached colored and uncolored MF permeates were manufactured as controls. All treatments were manufactured in triplicate. All SPC80 were evaluated by sensory testing, instrumental analyses, functionality, color, and proximate analysis. The HP-bleached SPC80 was higher in lipid oxidation compounds than BP-bleached or unbleached SPC80, specifically hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, decanal, and 2,3-octadienone. The HP treatments were higher in aroma intensity and cardboard and fatty flavors compared with the unbleached and BP-bleached SPC80. The SPC80 bleached with BP had lower concentrations of norbixin compared with SPC80 bleached with HP. Functionality testing demonstrated that HP treatments had more soluble protein after 10min of heating at 90°C and pH 4.6 and pH 7 compared with the no bleach and BP treatments, regardless of additional color. Foams generated from bleached SPC80 were more stable than those from unbleached SPC80, and those bleached with HP were lower in yield stress than other SPC80. Overall, HP bleaching destroyed less norbixin and caused more lipid oxidation and subsequent off-flavors than did BP bleaching.

Lipid extracts of pure raw milk, commercial milk, and binary mixtures of cows' and goats' milk and cows' and sheep's milk (the concentrations of each milk varied from 0 % to 50 %) were analyzed with α-cyano-4-chlorocinnamic acid as matrix. The abundance ratio of the ions at m/z 703 and m/z 706 was found to be species-correlated and was used as marker of cows' milk in sheep's and goats' milk. Furthermore, the procedure could potentially be applied to cheese samples, because peaks at m/z 703 and 706 were also found in several commercial cheese samples.

The option of a free myo-inositol determination or a complete total myo-inositol determination from main bound sources can be achieved. These sources include phytates, lower'phosphorylated forms, and phosphatidylinositol. This approach gives the option for subtraction of myo-inositol from nonbioavailable sources when it is quantified using other methods if a total bioavailable myo-inositol result is desired for nutritional labeling of a product. The free analysis was validated in a milk-based infant formula, giving RSD(R) of 2.29% and RSD, of 2.06%. A mean recovery of 97.9% was achieved from various spike levels of myo-inositol. Certified National Institute of Standards and Technology reference material verified the method's compatibility and specificity. Two different total analyses were validated in a soy-based infant formula and compared. One technique involved using a conventional acid hydrolysis with autoclave incubation for 6 h, while the other used a novel technique of microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis with enzymatic treatment that can minimize extraction to 1 day. The autoclave analysis had RSD(R) of 2.08% and RSDr of 1.55%, along with a mean spike recovery of 102.1% at various myo-inositol spike levels. The microwave/enzyme total analysis had RSD(R) of 4.34% and RSD, of 4.70%, along with a mean spike recovery of 104.2% at various spike levels of myo-inositol.

Participants responded to a 24-h dietary recall questionnaire on the 74th and 76th day of lactation and to a Food Frequency Questionnaire querying the frequency of fish intake over the last 90 days. Usual intake was estimated using the PC-SIDE software package. A meal of fish was offered on the 75th day of lactation. Mothers' individual mean THg levels ranged from <0.76 to 22.7 ng/mL during the period, and the mean level for all samples (n = 142) was 6.47 ±6.04 ng/mL. The multilevel mixed linear model used showed high heterogeneity of the mercury levels among the mothers, and THg levels did not change significantly over the period under study. However, a significant increase in THg levels was observed after the intervention with the fish meal. Exposure increased for most infants on the 90th day of lactation, with intakes exceeding the THg provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) at least once during the period for 77.8 % of samples. Mothers consumed mostly food from the fat and grain groups, and a significant correlation was detected between consumption of food of these groups and breast milk THg levels (p = 0.006 and 0.007). A significant correlation was also found between vegetable consumption and carbohydrate intake and THg levels in the samples (p = 0.015 and 0.045, respectively). No correlation was found between mothers' daily fish consumption frequency and THg levels.

Individual milk samples were collected from 913 Brown Swiss cows reared in 63 herds located in Trento Province (Italy). Milk coagulation properties (MCP) were measured using 2 different instruments: Formagraph and Optigraph. Both instruments were housed in the same laboratory and operated by the same technician. Each sample was analyzed simultaneously on each instrument. All experimental conditions (milk temperature and the concentration and type of rennet) were identical. For the analysis, univariate and bivariate animal models were implemented using Bayesian methods. Univariate analyses were conducted to test the hypothesis that the traits showed additive genetic determination. Deviance information criterion, Bayes factor, and mean squared error were used as model choice criteria. The main results were that (1) RCT could be measured on all samples by extending the observation time to 45 min, and its genetic parameters (h(2)=0.23) and breeding values could be estimated while avoiding the bias of noncoagulating samples; (2) curd-firming rate could be measured on almost all milk samples, and its genetic parameters could be estimated for the first time on a field data set (h(2)=0.21); (3) for the first time, genetic parameters of curd firmness 45 min after rennet addition (h(2)=0.12) were estimated, and they were compared with curd firmness 30 min after rennet addition (h(2)=0.17); and (4) MCP estimated using the Optigraph appeared to be genetically different from those determined by Formagraph, with the partial exception of RCT (genetic correlation=0.97). Breeding strategies for the improvement of MCP must be planned with caution.

The farming system was either extensive, using autochthonous cows fed a pasture-based diet, or intensive, with specialized dairy cow breeds fed mainly hay and concentrate. The cheese-processing technology was either artisanal, using traditional wooden tools and endemic lactic bacteria, or advanced, using modern steel equipment and selected lactic bacteria.

23089266,"Sialic acid, being a biologically active compound, is recognised as an important component of milk and milk products. Almost all the sialic acid estimation protocols in milk require prior hydrolysis step to release the bound sialic acid followed by its estimation. The objective of this work was to estimate sialic acid in milk and milk products by fluorimetric assay which does not require a prior hydrolysis step thus decreasing the estimation time. The recovery of added sialic acid in milk was 91·6 to 95·8%. Sialic acid in milk was found to be dependent on cattle breed and was in the range of 1·68-3·93 g/kg (dry matter basis). The assay was further extended to detect adulteration of milk with sweet whey which is based on the detection of glycomacropeptide (GMP) bound sialic acid in adulterated milk. GMP is the C-terminal part of κ-casein which is released into the whey during cheese making. For detection of adulteration, selective precipitation of GMP was done using trichloroacetic acid (TCA). TCA concentration in milk was first raised to 5% to precipitate milk proteins, especially κ-casein, followed by raising the TCA concentration to 14% to precipitate out GMP. In the precipitates GMP bound sialic acid was estimated using fluorimetric method and the fluorescence intensity was found to be directly proportional to the level of sweet whey in adulterated milk samples. The method was found to detect the presence of 5% sweet whey in milk.",The Journal of dairy research,"['D000818', 'D002364', 'D002417', 'D011232', 'D003611', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D019158', 'D010446', 'D013050']","['Animals', 'Caseins', 'Cattle', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Dairy Products', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",Direct estimation of sialic acid in milk and milk products by fluorimetry and its application in detection of sweet whey adulteration in milk.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23089266,2013
23084885,"Montasio is a typical protected designation of origin (PDO) Italian semi-hard and semi-cooked cheese produced in northeast Italy from raw or thermized cow's milk. The PDO label implies that the product has distinctive characteristics that are connected to traditional production methods. The aim of this work was to precisely characterize the volatile fraction of this Italian cheese. The volatile profile can be considered a fingerprint because the flavor of a cheese variety is the result of a specific balance between the volatile compounds produced during the ripening process. Analysis of the volatile profile of Montasio cheese was performed by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography. Six cheesemaking trials were performed, each in a different dairy located within the Montasio cheese production area. Cheeses were analyzed at 5 stages of ripening (60, 90, 170, 300, and 365 d). Only 11 compounds were identified and measured: 5 fatty acids, 3 alcohols, 2 ketones, and 1 ester. The limited number of volatile compounds measured in the headspace of the Montasio cheese is probably due to the specific making process of this cheese, which affects evolution of the microflora and the biochemical processes of ripening. The total volatile fraction profile progressively increased from 60 to 170 d, after which time it remained almost steady. The most important contributors were found to be ethanol, short-chain fatty acids (C(2) to C(6)), diacetyl, and ethyl hexanoate. Ethanol and short-chain fatty acids increased up to 170 d, diacetyl increased up to 300 d and then declined, and ethyl hexanoate increased until the final stage.",Journal of dairy science,"['D002611', 'D002849', 'D063427', 'D005524', 'D007558', 'D052617', 'D055549']","['Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Food Quality', 'Food Technology', 'Italy', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Characterization by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography of the volatile profile of protected designation of origin Montasio cheese during ripening.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods', None, 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23084885,2013

In this study, a simple method to determine nicotianamine was developed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with a multimode ODS column. This method does not need derivatizing or ion-pairing reagents to retain nicotianamine, which is known for its poor retention on reversed-phase columns because of its high polarity. Moreover, this method showed a sufficient limit of detection (0.5 ng/mL), so it was found to be suitable for the analysis of nicotianamine in soy sauce and other foods, without cleanup. To subtract the matrix effect during LC-MS/MS analysis, a standard addition method was used. The levels of nicotianamine in soy sauce ranged from <0.25 to 71 μg/g.

Despite the severity of allergic reactions and growing prevalence in children and adults, there is no cure for peanut allergy, leaving avoidance as the primary mode of treatment. To improve analytical methods for peanut allergen detection, researchers must overcome obstacles involved in handling complex food matrices while attempting to decipher the chemistry that underlies allergen protein interactions. To address such challenges, we conducted a global proteome characterization of raw peanuts using a sophisticated GELFrEE-PAGE-LC-MS/MS platform consisting of gel-based protein fractionation followed by mass spectrometric identification. The in-solution mass-selective protein fractionation: (1) enhances the number of unique peptide identifications, (2) provides a visual map of protein isoforms, and (3) aids in the identification of disulfide-linked protein complexes. GELFrEE-PAGE-LC-MS/MS not only overcomes many of the challenges involved in the study of plant proteomics, but enriches the understanding of peanut protein chemistry, which is typically unattainable in a traditional bottom-up proteomic analysis.

22988791,"According to the generally accepted theory, the atherosclerosis is a kind of disorder of metabolism of lipids which chemically are the ethers of fatty lipids with spirits. Hence, the atherosclerosis is fatty acids pathology. In conformity with the biologic classification, among fatty acids it is functionally valid to distinguish saturated fatty acids without double bonds; monoenic fatty acids with one double bond; unsaturated fatty acids with two or three double bonds and polyenic fatty acids with four of six double bonds in chain. The saturated and monenic fatty acids are the substrates for cells to groundwork energy, ATP The unsaturated fatty acids in vivo are needed to form membranes. The polyenic fatty acids are essential since they are precursors of cell synthesis of humoral regulators--eicosanoids (prostanoids and leukotrienes). To clarify the pathogenesis of the ""metabolic pandemics"" most prevalent in human population, the quantitative determination of individual fatty acids in blood plasma and erythrocytes using gas chromatography technique is needed. It is necessary to evaluate the content of medium chain fatty acids; palmitic and stearic saturated fatty acids; oleic monoenic fatty acid and its transforms--linoleic, linolenic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic unsaturated fatty acids; essential polyenic omega-6 arachidonic, omega-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids. The higher is in food the content of palmitic saturated fatty acid, palmitoleic and trans-vaccenic monoenic fatty acids, the more is in patient diet of beef meat and products of fat cow's milk. The higher is ratio of palmitic/oleic fatty acids the lower is the risk of formation of atheromatosis of arteries intima and development of ischemic heart disease and vice versa. The decrease of ratio of omega-3/omega-6 essential polyenic fatty acids is undesirable in prognostic sense. The metabolism of these acids differs and functional activity of omega-3 eicosanoid type 3 is higher In case of deficiency of omega-3 and omega-6 polyenic fatty acids in cells eicosanoids are synthesized from unsaturated dihomogamma-linolenic fatty acid and their influence turns out to be aphysiologic.

The method involves mild hydrolysis of the foods, an extraction of the supernatant by centrifugation followed by quantitative determination using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. Separation of the two water soluble vitamins is achieved within one minute and the resultant sample is also LC-MS compatible. Despite wide individual differences between brands (p=6.5e-12), no significant differences were observed in the level of pyridoxine between the meat and vegetable-based varieties (p=0.7) per 100g of commercial infant food.

This value is due in part to the balanced composition of the seed which is roughly 1:2:2 oil, starch, and protein by weight. In turn, the seeds have many uses with various derivatives appearing broadly in processed food products. As is true with many edible seeds, soybeans contain proteins that are anti-nutritional factors and allergens. Soybean, along with milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and wheat, elicit a majority of food allergy reactions in the United States. Soybean seed composition can be affected by breeding, and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture, insect/pathogen load, and/or soil nutrient levels). The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of genotype and environment on allergen and anti-nutritional proteins in soybean. To address genetic and environmental effects, four varieties of non-GM soybeans were grown in six geographically distinct regions of North America (Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Ontario, and Pennsylvania). Absolute quantification of proteins by mass spectrometry can be achieved with a technique called multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), during which signals from an endogenous protein are compared to those from a synthetic heavy-labeled internal standard. Using MRM, eight allergens were absolutely quantified for each variety in each environment.

Both operation modes are based on the highly selective T-Hg(2+)-T coordination between two neighboring polythymine (T) strands at a high probe density and its induced displacement of the complementary polyadenine strand labeled with either fluorophore or quencher, which enables the turn-off and turn-on detection of Hg(2+), respectively. The turn-off sensor is slightly more sensitive than the turn-on sensor, and their detection limits are 3.6 and 8.6 nM, respectively, which are both lower than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency limit of [Hg(2+)] for drinkable water (10 nM, 2 ppb). Compared to the turn-off sensor with the dynamic Hg(2+) detection range from 3.6 nM to 10 μM (R(2) = 0.99), the turn-on sensor has a broader dynamic Hg(2+) detection range, from 8.6 nM to 100 μM (R(2) = 0.996). Both sensors exhibited superior selectivity over other reported sensors using thymine-rich probes for Hg(2+) detection over other common metal ions. In addition, the practical application of the chip-based sensors was demonstrated by detecting spiked Hg(2+) in drinking water and fresh milk. The sensor has great potential for on-site practical applications due to its operational convenience, simplicity, speed, and portability.",Analytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D007477', 'D008628', 'D046228', 'D008892', 'D009841', 'D011071', 'D013050', 'D014867']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Ions', 'Mercury', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Milk', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Poly T', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Water']",Highly sensitive and selective chip-based fluorescent sensor for mercuric ion: development and comparison of turn-on and turn-off systems.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22957843,2013
22939159,"Advancements in sample preparation for performing trace analysis of inorganic analytes are coming from the dissemination of microwave-assisted procedures, but there is still room for improvements by looking for simple and easily applied procedures. Recently it was proposed a new approach called single reaction chamber with capability for digestions at high pressures and temperatures using simple vials and racks. This was a limitation of former cavity microwave ovens with closed vessels. It was demonstrated here that the use of single reaction chamber approach allows the implementation of efficient digestions using diluted solutions of nitric acid and also allows addressing a critical need of sample preparation for inorganic analysis by running mixed batches of samples. The feasibility of this procedure was demonstrated for organic samples and accuracy was proved by using certified reference materials of apple leaves, bovine liver and whole milk powder. Digestions performed of whole milk powder and bovine liver using 2.0 mol L(-1) nitric acid solution plus concentrated hydrogen peroxide at 240 °C led to residual carbon contents of 0.825 and 1.50% and residual acidities of 1.04 and 0.618 mol L(-1), respectively.

22931122,"Milk and cheese are expensive foodstuffs, and their consumption is spread among the population because of their high nutritional value; for this reason they are often subjected to adulterations. Among the common illegal practices, the addition of powdered derivatives seems very difficult to detect because the adulterant materials have almost the same chemical composition of liquid milk. However, the high temperatures (180-200 °C) used for milk powder production could imply the occurrence of some protein modifications (e.g., glycation, lactosylation, oxidation, deamidation, dehydration). The modified proteins or peptides could then be used as markers for the presence of powdered milk. In this work, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was employed to analyze tryptic digests relevant to samples of raw liquid (without heat treatment), commercial liquid, and powdered cow's milk. Samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE); differences among liquid and powder milk were detected at this stage and eventually confirmed by MALDI analysis of the in gel digested proteins. Some diagnostic peptides of powdered milk, attributed to modified whey proteins and/or caseins, were identified. Then, a faster procedure was optimized, consisting of the separation of caseins from milk whey and the subsequent in-solution digestion of the two fractions, with the advantage of obtaining almost the same information in a limited amount of time. Finally, analyses were carried out with the fast procedure on liquid milk samples adulterated with powdered milk at different percentages, and diagnostic peptides were detected down to 1% of adulteration level.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D005506', 'D008892', 'D011208', 'D040901', 'D019032']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Food Contamination', 'Milk', 'Powders', 'Proteomics', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Proteomic approach based on MALDI-TOF MS to detect powdered milk in fresh cow's milk.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000379']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22931122,2013

The effects of partial-vacuum packaging and fluorescent lighting were studied during the cheese shelf life (45 d) and 15 d after. Storage conditions did not affect the pH values (4.3), whereas a slight decrease in moisture (ca. 1%) and in water activity (<0.01 units) was recorded. Proteolysis monitored by Kjeldahl determination increased significantly during storage of all samples. The highest increase from 8.5 to 13.0% of soluble nitrogen (expressed as percentage of total nitrogen) was measured in cheese packaged in the presence of air and stored in a lighted cabinet. The proteolytic trend was also studied through capillary zone electrophoresis by monitoring the degradation of the main casein fractions and the formation of new peptides. In particular, 2 indices, based on peak area ratio of new-formed peptides and casein fractions were related to cheese age. Lipolysis, measured by solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry of volatile fatty acids, was unaffected by air or light and did not proceed through storage. As expected, hexanal formed mainly in cheeses stored under light and packaged in air. Evaluation of sensorial quality, performed using a hedonic scale, showed significantly lower scores of cheeses kept under light compared with those kept in the dark, both at 45 and 60 d storage.

A basis of a composition forms protein/peptide product (PPP) received by enzymatic hydrolysis of meat and bone residues of processing of a bird, representing rather unvaluable food raw material. Molecular-mass distribution of fractions in PPP is quantitatively determined by an exclusion chromatography method of average pressure with the subsequent integration of chromatograms with a weight method. It can be supported the essential decrease of initial antigenicity of processed food raw materials as almost 80% from all sum protein/peptides and peptide/amino acid fractions are submitted by amino acids and peptides which molecular weight < or = 6 kD. The analysis of amino acid structure of PPP shows that the increase of its biological value assumes the increase of its score on four irreplaceable amino acids: leucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine (totally). For getting of the protein/peptide compositions of high biological value, the ""above enrichment"" of PPP by total protein of the cow milk is carried out. The modeling of a process of getting a two-component mix is carried out by a graphic method. The least percentage of the added total protein of a cow milk to PPP, at which is reached the amino acid score of the mix equal to 1,0, makes 26% from weight of the mix.

Different food products such as pasta, milk, and tigelle bread (a typical Italian unleavened bread) were also analyzed. Some of the samples have also been analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC, and when compared to CE-MS, data obtained showed good agreement.

22851358,"Commission Decision (CD) 2002/657/EC describes detailed rules for method validation within the framework of residue monitoring programmes. The approach described in this CD is based on criteria. For (qualitative) screening methods, the most important criteria is that the CCβ has to be below any regulatory limit. Especially when microbiological or immunochemical methods are involved, the approach described in the CD is not easily applied. For example, by those methods, a large number of analytes (all antibiotics) within several different matrices (meat, milk, fish, eggs, etc.) are detected. It is not completely clear whether all those analytes and all matrices have to be taken into account during method validation. To clarify this, a working group - from EU Reference Laboratories - came up with a practical approach to validate multi-analyte multi-matrix screening methods. It describes how many analyte/matrix combinations have to be tested and how these combinations are selected. Furthermore it describes how to determine CCβ for screening methods in relation to a large list of compounds and maximum residue limits (MRLs). First for each analyte/matrix combination the 'cut-off' level - i.e. the level at which the method separates blanks from contaminated samples - is established. The validation is preferably at the concentration of 50% of the regulatory limit. A minimum set of 20 different samples has to be tested. From the experiences with applying these guidelines it was concluded that the validation approach is very 'practical'; however, there are some remarks. One has to be careful with selecting 'representative' analytes and matrices and it is strongly recommended to collect additional validation data during the routine application of the method.",Drug testing and analysis,"['D000818', 'D000900', 'D002701', 'D003049', 'D005062', 'D005434', 'D005504', 'D007124', 'D013058', 'D054928', 'D019155']","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Coccidiostats', 'European Union', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food Analysis', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Validation Studies as Topic', 'Veterinary Drugs']",Application of EU guidelines for the validation of screening methods for veterinary drugs.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'methods', 'methods', 'methods', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22851358,2012
22863106,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different storage temperatures and delivery system of the milk on the microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of Grana Trentino, a long-ripened hard-cooked Italian cheese. In particular, 3 kinds of milk storage and delivery were studied: milk delivered to the dairy in the traditional manner without temperature control, milk delivered at 18°C, and milk stored at the farm and delivered at 12°C. Milk, natural whey starter, and cheeses after 18 mo of ripening were sampled for microbiological profiles, physicochemical analysis, and proteolysis evaluation, and a study of cheese volatile compounds through a solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique was performed. Milk microbiota was not affected by any of the treatments. At the end of ripening, free fatty acid and ester contents were significantly higher in cheeses from milk without temperature control. This was probably due to the milk delivery to the dairy in churns causing the fat globule membrane break during transport and, consequently, a greater release of fat and deeper lipolysis. Milk refrigeration at 12°C for 12h before delivery affected the distribution of nitrogen fractions in cheeses. Lower temperatures of milk storage favored a larger soluble nitrogen fraction and greater cheese proteolysis, probably caused by an enhanced plasmin activity. From this work, it is concluded that both milk temperature storage and transport system could affect cheese ripening, leading to significant differences in chemical compounds: if milk was delivered by churns, higher free fatty acid and ester content in cheeses was observed; if milk was stored at 12°C for 12h before delivery, greater cheese proteolysis was induced with consequent faster ripening.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000596', 'D000818', 'D058491', 'D002417', 'D002611', 'D005511', 'D061353', 'D007558', 'D008892', 'D059748', 'D055549']","['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Load', 'Cattle', 'Cheese', 'Food Handling', 'Food Storage', 'Italy', 'Milk', 'Proteolysis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Does milk treatment before cheesemaking affect microbial and chemical traits of ripened cheese?

Methacrylic acid, ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate and toluene were selected as functional monomer, crosslinker and porogen, respectively. The molecular recognition property and binding capability of cyromazine and melamine were evaluated by adsorption test and Scatchard analysis. The results showed that the molecularly imprinted polymer based on pseudo template had more excellent affinity and selectivity for cyromazine and melamine. The resulting molecularly imprinted polymer was used as a solid-phase extraction material to enrich cyromazine and melamine in egg and milk samples for high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The solid-phase extraction process was carefully optimized. It was found that when different concentration of cyromazine and melamine standards were spiked into samples, satisfactory recovery rate of cyromazine and melamine were obtained as 85.6-98.8% with relative standard deviation <5.5%.",Journal of separation science,"['D000327', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D002645', 'D002851', 'D004531', 'D005506', 'D008892', 'D054802', 'D011108', 'D052616', 'D014227']","['Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Eggs', 'Food Contamination', 'Milk', 'Molecular Imprinting', 'Polymers', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Triazines']",The application of pseudo template molecularly imprinted polymer to the solid-phase extraction of cyromazine and its metabolic melamine from egg and milk.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000138', 'Q000295', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'chemical synthesis', 'instrumentation', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22740253,2012
22722200,"In the prehistoric green Sahara of Holocene North Africa-in contrast to the Neolithic of Europe and Eurasia-a reliance on cattle, sheep and goats emerged as a stable and widespread way of life, long before the first evidence for domesticated plants or settled village farming communities. The remarkable rock art found widely across the region depicts cattle herding among early Saharan pastoral groups, and includes rare scenes of milking; however, these images can rarely be reliably dated. Although the faunal evidence provides further confirmation of the importance of cattle and other domesticates, the scarcity of cattle bones makes it impossible to ascertain herd structures via kill-off patterns, thereby precluding interpretations of whether dairying was practiced. Because pottery production begins early in northern Africa the potential exists to investigate diet and subsistence practices using molecular and isotopic analyses of absorbed food residues. This approach has been successful in determining the chronology of dairying beginning in the 'Fertile Crescent' of the Near East and its spread across Europe. Here we report the first unequivocal chemical evidence, based on the δ(13)C and Δ(13)C values of the major alkanoic acids of milk fat, for the adoption of dairying practices by prehistoric Saharan African people in the fifth millennium bc. Interpretations are supported by a new database of modern ruminant animal fats collected from Africa. These findings confirm the importance of 'lifetime products', such as milk, in early Saharan pastoralism, and provide an evolutionary context for the emergence of lactase persistence in Africa.",Nature,"['D000818', 'D001106', 'D001154', 'D002417', 'D059552', 'D002849', 'D003612', 'D004032', 'D004041', 'D005502', 'D008401', 'D006041', 'D049690', 'D006801', 'D043322', 'D008002', 'D058751', 'D008892', 'D055110', 'D012756']","['Animals', 'Archaeology', 'Art', 'Cattle', 'Caves', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Dairying', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Food', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Goats', 'History, Ancient', 'Humans', 'Lactase', 'Libya', 'Livestock', 'Milk', 'Radiometric Dating', 'Sheep']",First dairying in green Saharan Africa in the fifth millennium BC.,"[None, None, 'Q000266', None, None, None, 'Q000266', 'Q000266', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000502', None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000502']","[None, None, 'history', None, None, None, 'history', 'history', 'analysis', None, None, 'physiology', None, None, 'genetics', None, 'physiology', 'chemistry', None, 'physiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22722200,2012
22649911,"At the ""Standards Development and International Harmonization: AOAC INTERNATIONAL Mid-Year Meeting,"" on June 29, 2011, an Expert Review Panel agreed that the method ""Determination of Vitamin B12 in Infant Formulas and Adult Nutritionals by Liquid Chromatography/UV Detection with Immunoaffinity Extraction"" be adopted AOAC Official First Action status. The method is applicable for the determination of vitamin B12, which includes added cyanocobalamin and natural forms, making it applicable to both fortified and nonfortified products. Vitamin B12 is extracted from the sample in sodium acetate buffer in the presence of sodium cyanide (100 degrees C, 30 min). After purification and concentration with an immunoaffinity column, vitamin B12 is determined by LC with UV detection (361 nm). A single-laboratory validation study was conducted on a range of products, including milk- and soy-based infant formulas, cereals, cocoa beverages, health care products, and polyvitamin premixes. The method demonstrated linear response over a large range of concentrations, recovery rates of 100.8 +/- 7.5% (average +/- SD), repeatability RSD (RSDr) of 2.1%, and intermediate reproducibility (RSD(iR)) of 4.3%. LOD and LOQ values were 0.10 and 0.30 microg/100 g, respectively, and correlation with the reference microbiological assay was good (R2 = 0.9442). The results of the study were published in J.

We recruited 40 healthy men and women into a double-blind, parallel design, randomized controlled trial. Participants received placebo or 1 of 4 experimental treatments (D2 or D3 at 5 or 10 μg/d) supplied as a malted milk drink for 4 wk during a period of minimal UV-B exposure in the UK. The primary outcome was a change in serum 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3 concentrations measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem MS. The secondary outcomes were changes in concentrations of plasma parathyroid hormone and serum calcium (Ca(2+)). Baseline concentrations (geometric mean ± SD) of 25-OH-D2, 25-OH-D3, and total 25-OH-D were 3 ± 4, 32 ± 22, and 37 ± 22 nmol/L, respectively.

22612925,"Lactoperoxidase (LP) is the second most abundant enzyme in bovine milk and has been used in conjunction with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) to work as an antimicrobial in raw milk where pasteurization is not feasible. Thiocyanate is naturally present and the lactoperoxidase system purportedly can be used to bleach dairy products, such as whey, with the addition of very little H₂O₂ to the system. This study had 3 objectives: 1) to quantify the amount of H₂O₂ necessary for bleaching of fluid whey using the LP system, 2) to monitor LP activity from raw milk through manufacture of liquid whey, and 3) to compare the flavor of whey protein concentrate 80% (WPC80) bleached by the LP system to that bleached by traditional H₂O₂ bleaching. Cheddar cheese whey with annatto (15 mL of annatto/454 kg of milk, annatto with 3% wt/vol norbixin content) was manufactured using a standard Cheddar cheesemaking procedure. Various levels of H₂O₂ (5-100 mg/kg) were added to fluid whey to determine the optimum concentration of H₂O₂ for LP activity, which was measured using an established colorimetric method. In subsequent experiments, fat-separated whey was bleached for 1h with 250 mg of H₂O₂/kg (traditional) or 20 mg of H₂O₂/kg (LP system). The WPC80 was manufactured from whey bleached with 250 mg of H₂O₂/kg or 20mg of H₂O₂/kg. All samples were subjected to color analysis (Hunter color values and norbixin extraction) and proximate analysis (fat, protein, and moisture). Sensory and instrumental volatile analyses were conducted on WPC80. Optimal LP bleaching in fluid whey occurred with the addition of 20mg of H₂O₂/kg. Bleaching of fluid whey at either 35 or 50°C for 1 h with LP resulted in > 99% norbixin destruction compared with 32 or 47% destruction from bleaching with 250 mg of H₂O₂/kg, at 35 or 50°C for 1 h, respectively. Higher aroma intensity and increased lipid oxidation compounds were documented in WPC80 from bleached whey compared with WPC80 from unbleached whey. Monitoring of LP activity throughout cheese and whey manufacture showed that LP activity sharply decreased after 30 min of bleaching (17.01 ± 1.4 to < 1 U/mL), suggesting that sufficient bleaching takes place in a very short amount of time. Lactoperoxidase averaged 13.01 ± 0.7 U/mL in unpasteurized, fat-separated liquid whey and 138.6 ± 11.9 U/mL in concentrated retentate (11% solids).

The Selected Ion Flow Tube-Mass Spectrometric (SIFT-MS) technique was used to compare 4 New Zealand cheeses marketed as ""parmesan"" with 4 Italian Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano cheeses. The cheese headspace was analyzed in real time without any sample preconcentration. Total of 38 volatile compounds in the cheese headspace were monitored with headspace concentrations varying between single digit parts per billion (ppb) to tens of parts per million (ppm). When the results were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis, a clear discrimination was found between the New Zealand ""parmesan"" and Italian cheeses based solely on the measured concentrations of these volatile compounds. If the volatile compounds used in the analyses were restricted to known odor-active compounds in Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, the ability to discriminate between the cheeses was maintained. The analyses also showed that it was possible to clearly differentiate between the different processing plants in individual countries. Important discriminatory volatiles in the samples tested were butanoic acid and phenylacetaldehyde for discriminating between Italian cheeses and ethyl butyrate, acetaldehyde and methylbutanals between New Zealand cheeses.

The toxin acts to inhibit acetylcholine release, resulting in paralysis and death. Naturally occurring foodborne disease is most often the result of improper canning of foods, while wound botulism, associated with injection drug users, is on the rise. Because of its potency, BoNTs have also been identified as targets for use by bioterrorists. The 'gold standard' of detection of BoNTs is the mouse bioassay, an expensive and time consuming test that requires specialized equipment and trained personnel. There is a need for a rapid, sensitive diagnostic for BoNTs that could be used by minimally trained personnel in the event of a foodborne outbreak or a bioterrorist threat. Here, we describe the use of a single lateral flow device (LFD) that can detect and distinguish between BoNT/A and B, two of the four serotypes that are known to intoxicate humans and together represent >80% of naturally occurring illness.

Under optimum conditions, a good linear relationship was obtained from 2.0 × 10(-9) to 5.0 × 10(-5)M. The detection limit was 1.0 × 10(-9)M, which was much lower than the safety limit (2.5 ppm in USA and the UK; 1 ppm for infant formula in China). The solution pH, the adding sequence of the buffer solution and MA and surface modifiers of CdS QDs greatly influenced the enhancement extent of MA for CdS QDs. The fluorescence enhancement was attributed to the surface passivation of the surface states of QDs by amine group of MA. The method was applied to detect MA in raw milk with satisfactory results.

Corn silage was cultivated on cropland in Lower Saxony in Germany where, as a result of illegal waste disposal in 2006, farmland was contaminated with perfluorinated alkylacids (PFAAs). Two sheep were exposed by way of PFAA-contaminated corn silage to PFOS (1.16 and 1.45 μg/kg body weight [bw]/d, respectively) and PFOA (0.43 and 0.53 μg/kg bw/d) during a period of 21 days. During the PFAA-feeding period, PFOS levels in plasma increased continuously to maximum concentration of 103 and 240 μg/L for sheep 1 and sheep 2, respectively. The PFOA plasma concentration remained low (sheep 1 = 3.3 ± 2.2 μg/L; sheep 2 = 15.6 ± 8.3 μg/L). Data indicate that urinary excretion is the primary clearance route for PFOA (sheep 1 = 51 %; sheep 2 = 55 %), whereas PFOS excretion by way of urine could not be quantified. The highest PFOS excretion (4 to 5 %) was detected in faeces. PFOS was also excreted at higher levels than PFOA by way of milk. During a period of 21 days, a total PFOS transfer into milk ≤ 2 % was calculated. Overall, total excretion of PFOS was significantly lower compared with that of PFOA (PFOS 6 %; PFOA 53 to 56 %). PFOS levels in sheep 1 and sheep 2 were highest in liver (885 and 1,172 μg/kg weight wet [ww], respectively) and lowest in muscle tissue (24.4 and 35.1 μg/kg ww, respectively). PFOA levels in muscle tissue were low for sheep 2 (0.23 μg/kg ww) and not detectable after the PFAA-free feeding period in sheep 1.

22337795,"A fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method is developed to determine lincomycin (LM) in honey, muscle, milk, and egg. Samples are cleaned-up at pH 4.7 using Strata-X-C mixed-mode polymeric strong cation exchange solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, which could selectively adsorb the lincomycin from matrices under the acidic condition. LM is separated on the recently introduced Kinetex XB core-shell type HPLC column using isocratic elution mode with a mobile phase containing 0.1% formic acid in water/acetonitrile (93/7, v/v, pH 2.6) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. The subsequent MS/MS detection has decreased ion effect, which allows the limit of detection (LOD) of LM for honey to be 0.05 µg/kg for honey and 0.5 µg/kg for muscle, milk, and egg. These LODs are much lower than those reported previously. The other main advantage of the developed method is the analysis time of only 3.5 min, which is about three times shorter than other reported LC-MS-MS methods. Recoveries varies between 94.2% and 125.2% and in-house reproducibility ranges from 3.7% to 28.7%.

22332636,"Hormones work in harmony in the body, and this status must be maintained to avoid metabolic disequilibrium and the subsequent illness. Besides, it has been reported that exogenous steroids (presence in the environment and food products) influence the development of several important illnesses in humans. Endogenous steroid hormones in food of animal origin are unavoidable as they occur naturally in these products. The presence of hormones in food has been connected with several human health problems. Bovine milk contains considerable quantities of hormones and it is of particular concern. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, based on hydroxylamine derivatisation, has been developed and validated for the quantification of six sex hormones in milk [pregnenolone (P₅), progesterone (P₄), estrone (E₁), testosterone (T), androstenedione (A) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)]. This method has been applied to real raw milk samples and the existence of differences between milk from pregnant and non-pregnant cows has been statistically confirmed. Basing on a revision of existing published data, it could be concluded that maximum daily intakes for hormones are not reached through milk ingestion. Although dairy products are an important source of hormones, other products of animal origin must be considered as well for intake calculations.","Food additives & contaminants.

22305888,"Due to increasingly available bacterial genomes in databases, proteomic tools have recently been used to screen proteins expressed by micro-organisms in food in order to better understand their metabolism in situ. While the main objective is the systematic identification of proteins, the next step will be to bridge the gap between identification and quantification of these proteins. For that purpose, a new mass spectrometry-based approach was applied, using isobaric tagging reagent for quantitative proteomic analysis (iTRAQ), which are amine specific and yield labelled peptides identical in mass. Experimental Swiss-type cheeses were manufactured from microfiltered milk using Streptococcus thermophilus ITG ST20 and Lactobacillus helveticus ITG LH1 as lactic acid starters. At three ripening times (7, 20 and 69 days), cheese aqueous phases were extracted and enriched in bacterial proteins by fractionation. Each sample, standardised in protein amount prior to proteomic analyses, was: i) analysed by 2D-electrophoresis for qualitative analysis and ii) submitted to trypsinolysis, and labelled with specific iTRAQ tag, one per ripening time. The three labelled samples were mixed together and analysed by nano-LC coupled on-line with ESI-QTOF mass spectrometer. Thirty proteins, both from bacterial or bovine origin, were identified and efficiently quantified. The free bacterial proteins detected were enzymes from the central carbon metabolism as well as stress proteins.

22247688,"Dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) are hazardous toxic, ubiquitous and persistent chemical compounds, which can enter the food chain and accumulate up to higher trophic levels. Their determination requires sophisticated methods, expensive facilities and instruments, well-trained personnel and expensive chemical reagents. Ideally, real-time monitoring using rapid detection methods should be applied to detect possible contamination along the food chain in order to prevent human exposure. Sensor technology may be promising in this respect. This review gives the state of the art for detecting possible contamination with dioxins and DL-PCBs along the food chain of animal-source foods. The main detection methods applied (i.e., high resolution gas-chromatography combined with high resolution mass-spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) and the chemical activated luciferase gene expression method (CALUX bioassay)), each have their limitations. Biosensors for detecting dioxins and related compounds, although still under development, show potential to overcome these limitations. Immunosensors and biomimetic-based biosensors potentially offer increased selectivity and sensitivity for dioxin and DL-PCB detection, while whole cell-based biosensors present interpretable biological results. The main shortcoming of current biosensors, however, is their detection level: this may be insufficient as limits for dioxins and DL-PCBs for food and feedstuffs are in pg per gram level. In addition, these contaminants are normally present in fat, a difficult matrix for biosensor detection. Therefore, simple and efficient extraction and clean-up procedures are required which may enable biosensors to detect dioxins and DL-PCBs contamination along the food chain.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000818', 'D015374', 'D004147', 'D004531', 'D020387', 'D008460', 'D008892', 'D011078']","['Animals', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Dioxins', 'Eggs', 'Food Chain', 'Meat', 'Milk', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls']","The need and potential of biosensors to detect dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls along the milk, eggs and meat food chain.","[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22247688,2012

22177229,"The technological and safety properties of 35 indigenous strains of Enterococcus faecium isolated from two Egyptian cheeses were characterised in order to determine their ability for rational manufacture of diversified and typical dairy products in the Middle East. A great diversity was observed within the 35 strains on the basis of their technological properties. A statistical analysis made it possible to distribute the 35 strains of E. faecium into different groups. Three groups were identified in terms of their acidification activity, measured by the Cinac system: a group of strains that quickly acidified milk, a second that moderately acidified milk, and a last cluster that revealed weak acidification activity. On the basis of texturing properties that were evaluated using a texturometer and a viscometer, a cluster of strains produced viscous and firm gels, a second cluster included fairly viscous, firm and cohesive gels, and a last group generated slightly viscous, but firm and very cohesive gels. By considering the aroma profiles that were determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, four clusters were identified. One cluster displayed a high dimethyl disulfide level, a second group of strains was highly aromatic, a third cluster led to typical ""lactic"" products, and the last cluster made it possible to obtain low aromatic products. None of the 35 strains proved to be β-haemolytic on the basis of the characterisation of their safety properties. The resistance to 20 antibiotics was assessed by the disc diffusion method. The 35 isolates were sensitive to 12 antibiotics, and among them, one isolate was resistant to only two antibiotics (nalixidic acid and streptomycin).

The selection was also tempered by the availability of reliable analytical standards. The analytical methodology designed to allow simultaneous determination of PXDD/Fs and PXBs, was based on internal standardisation with (13)C(12) labelled compounds and high resolution mass spectrometry and involved a new separation procedure using dual activated carbon column fractionation. In order to unambiguously measure these compounds a practical, higher mass resolution (13,500-15,000 res) was used, coupled with a judicious choice of analyte ions and relative ion ratios. Further specificity was incorporated by exploiting the differences in chromatographic retention from those of potential interferants. The methodology was validated and used to measure occurrence levels of these contaminants in different matrices such as milk, meat, fish, eggs, offal, shellfish and soil. The limits of detection achieved by this methodology ranged from 0.005 to 0.02ngkg(-1) fat for foods.

22071607,"For this study, we developed methods of determining ten perfluorinated chemicals in drinking water, milk, fish, beef, and pig liver using high-flow automated solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The analytes were separated on a core-shell Kinetex C18 column. The mobile phase was composed of methanol and 10-mM N-methylmorpholine. Milk was digested with 0.5 N potassium hydroxide in Milli-Q water, and was extracted with an Atlantic HLB disk to perform automated SPE at a flow rate ranged from 70 to 86 mL/min. Drinking water was directly extracted by the SPE. Solid food samples were digested in alkaline methanol and their supernatants were diluted and also processed by SPE. The disks were washed with 40% methanol/60% water and then eluted with 0.1% ammonium hydroxide in methanol. Suppression of signal intensity of most analytes by matrixes was lower than 50%; it was generally lower in fish and drinking water but higher in liver. Most quantitative biases and relative standard deviations were lower than 15%. The limits of detection for most analytes were sub-nanograms per liter for drinking water and sub-nanograms per gram for solid food samples. This method greatly shortened the time and labor needed for digestion, SPE, and liquid chromatography. This method has been applied to analyze 14 types of food samples. Perfluorooctanoic acid was found to be the highest among the analytes (median at 3.2-64 ng/g wet weight), followed by perfluorodecanoic acid (0.7-25 ng/g) and perfluorododecanoic acid (0.6-15 ng/g).",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002851', 'D060766', 'D005399', 'D005466', 'D005504', 'D057230', 'D008460', 'D008892', 'D052616', 'D013552', 'D053719', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drinking Water', 'Fishes', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Food Analysis', 'Limit of Detection', 'Meat', 'Milk', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Swine', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Determination of perfluorinated chemicals in food and drinking water using high-flow solid-phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.,"[None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22071607,2012
22065561,"Mold metabolites that can elicit deleterious effects on other organisms are classified as mycotoxins. Human exposure to mycotoxins occurs mostly through the intake of contaminated agricultural products or residues due to carry over or metabolite products in foods of animal origin such as milk and eggs, but can also occur by dermal contact and inhalation. Mycotoxins contained in moldy foods, but also in damp interiors, can cause diseases in humans and animals. Nephropathy, various types of cancer, alimentary toxic aleukia, hepatic diseases, various hemorrhagic syndromes, and immune and neurological disorders are the most common diseases that can be related to mycotoxicosis. The absence or presence of mold infestation and its propagation are seldom correlated with mycotoxin presence. Mycotoxins must be determined directly, and suitable analytical methods are necessary. Hundreds of mycotoxins have been recognized, but only for a few of them, and in a restricted number of utilities, a maximum acceptable level has been regulated by law. However, mycotoxins seldom develop alone; more often various types and/or classes form in the same substrate. The co-occurrence might render the individual mycotoxin tolerance dose irrelevant, and therefore the mere presence of multiple mycotoxins should be considered a risk factor. The advantage of chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) is that many compounds can be determined and confirmed in one analysis. This review illustrates the state-of-the-art of mycotoxin MS-based analytical methods for multiclass, multianalyte determination in all the matrices in which they appear. A chapter is devoted to the history of the long-standing coexistence and interaction among humans, domestic animals and mycotoxicosis, and the history of the discovery of mycotoxins. Quality assurance, although this topic relates to analytical chemistry in general, has been also examined for mycotoxin analysis as a preliminary to the systematic literature excursus. Sample handling is a crucial step to devise a multiclass analytical method; so when possible, it has been treated separately for a better comparison before tackling the instrumental part of the whole analytical method. This structure has resulted sometimes in unavoidable redundancies, because it was also important to underline the interconnection. Most reviews do not deal with all the possible mycotoxin sources, including the environmental ones. The focus of this review is the analytical methods based on MS for multimycotoxin class determination. Because the final purpose to devise multimycotoxin analysis should be the assessment of the danger to health of exposition to multitoxicants of natural origin (and possibly also the interaction with anthropogenic contaminants), therefore also the analytical methods for environmental relevant mycotoxins have been thoroughly reviewed. Finally, because the best way to shed light on actual risk assessment could be the individuation of exposure biomarkers, the review covers also the scarce literature on biological fluids.",Mass spectrometry reviews,"['D000818', 'D002853', 'D004781', 'D005516', 'D049690', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D015651', 'D009183', 'D012988', 'D014871']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Food Microbiology', 'History, Ancient', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mycotoxicosis', 'Mycotoxins', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Water Microbiology']","Multiclass mycotoxin analysis in food, environmental and biological matrices with chromatography/mass spectrometry.","[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000266', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'methods', 'history', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22065561,2012

22041936,"The accumulation of lead in several bones of Wistar rats with time was determined and compared for the different types of bones. Two groups were studied: a control group (n = 20), not exposed to lead and a contaminated group (n = 30), exposed to lead from birth, first indirectly through mother's milk, and then directly through a diet containing lead acetate in drinking water (0.2%). Rats age ranged from 1 to 11 months, with approximately 1 month intervals and each of the collections had 3 contaminated rats and 2 control rats. Iliac, femur, tibia-fibula and skull have been analysed by Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Technique (EDXRF). Samples of formaldehyde used to preserve the bone tissues were also analysed by Electrothermal Atomic Absorption (ETAAS), showing that there was no significant loss of lead from the tissue to the preservative. The bones mean lead concentration of exposed rats range from 100 to 300 μg g(-1) while control rats never exceeded 10 μg g(-1). Mean bone lead concentrations were compared and the concentrations were higher in iliac, femur and tibia-fibula and after that skull. However, of all the concentrations in the different collections, only those in the skull were statistically significantly different (p < 0.05) from the other types of bones. Analysis of a radar chart also allowed us to say that these differences tend to diminish with age. The Spearman correlation test applied to mean lead concentrations showed strong and very strong positive correlations between all different types of bones. This test also showed that mean lead concentrations in bones are negatively correlated with the age of the animals. This correlation is strong in iliac and femur and very strong in tibia-fibula and skull. It was also shown that the decrease of lead accumulation with age is made by three plateaus of accumulation, which coincide, in all analysed bones, between 2nd-3rd and 9th-10th months.",Metallomics : integrated biometal science,"['D000375', 'D000818', 'D001842', 'D002648', 'D004032', 'D005453', 'D006801', 'D007854', 'D009942', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D013054', 'D014965']","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Bone and Bones', 'Child', 'Diet', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Lead', 'Organometallic Compounds', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'X-Rays']",Study of lead accumulation in bones of Wistar rats by X-ray fluorescence analysis: aging effect.,"['Q000502', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000379', None]","['physiology', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22041936,2012

Concentrations of PAHs were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for human milk, placenta, and umbilical cord blood samples from 40 nonsmoking women and for 144 composite food samples covering major food categories. Information on food consumption and estimated ingestion doses of PAHs by the cohort was also collected individually.

Analytes tested included plant alkaloids, carbamate and organophosphate pesticides, and several types of veterinary drugs. A database containing the chemical formula for each analyte was used to calculate accurate mass-to-charge ratios for expected pseudo-molecular ions. This information, as well as retention times, was used to identify analytes. Of 118 compounds chosen for analysis, 86 were detectable in all fortified replicates of at least one matrix at levels ranging from 1.0 to 5000 ng/g. Variability of response, as measured in % relative standard deviation of peak areas over seven replicate fortified sample analyses, was found to differ among the classes of analytes, ranging from <10% to >100%. Retention times were stable and analytes were routinely detected at measured mass-to-charge ratios within 2 ppm of their theoretical mass-to-charge ratios.

Index values were calculated as radioactive concentrations of indicator radionuclides ((131)I for radioiodines, (134)Cs and (137)Cs for radiocesiums) by postulating the relative radioactive concentration of coexisting radionuclides (e.g., (132)I, (133)I, (134)I, (135)I and (132)Te for (131)I). Surveys were thence conducted to monitor levels of (131)I, (134)Cs and (137)Cs. Provisional regulation values were exceeded in tap water, raw milk and some vegetables, and restrictions on distribution and consumption began on 21 March. Fish contaminated with radioiodines at levels of concern were then detected, so that the provisional regulation value for radioiodines in seafood adopted from that in vegetables were additionally set on 5 April. Overall, restrictions started within 25 days after the first excess in each food or drink item, and maximum levels were detected in leafy vegetables (54,100 Bq/kg for (131)I, and a total of 82,000 Bq/kg for (134)Cs and (137)Cs).

These topics are attracting a great deal of attention, especially in recent years, when the international community has become increasingly aware of the central role of food quality and safety and their influence on the health of end-consumers. Early proteomics studies in the field of food research were mainly aimed at performing exploratory analyses of food (bovine, swine, chicken, or lamb meat, but also transgenic food such as genetically modified maize, for example) and beverages (wine), with the goal of improving the quality of the end-products. Recently, developments in the field of proteomics have also allowed the study of safety issues, as the technical advantages of sensitive techniques such as mass spectrometry have guaranteed a faster and improved individuation of food contaminating pathogens with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity.",Journal of proteome research,"['D000818', 'D018556', 'D005502', 'D005504', 'D005516', 'D059022', 'D006801', 'D010935', 'D040901']","['Animals', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'Food', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Microbiology', 'Food Safety', 'Humans', 'Plant Diseases', 'Proteomics']",We are what we eat: food safety and proteomics.,"[None, 'Q000382', 'Q000592', None, None, None, None, 'Q000382', None]","[None, 'microbiology', 'standards', None, None, None, None, 'microbiology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21992580,2012
21984012,"In poultry farming, anticoccidial drugs are widely used as feed additives for the prevention and treatment of coccidiosis. Because coccidiostats and veterinary medicines, in general, are often poorly absorbed, manure from treated animals may contain high concentrations of these compounds. Experimental studies have shown that the uptake of veterinary medicines by plants from soil containing contaminated manure may occur. This leads to several questions regarding the impact on the environment, resistance problems, and public health and allergy issues. This work describes the development of a quantification method for coccidiostats in vegetables. Vegetables were spiked at 100 μg kg(-1) (dry weight) with coccidiostats (monensin, narasin, lasalocid A, salinomycin, diclazuril, and nicarbazin) in order to optimize the extraction and clean-up. Possible critical factors (e.g., extraction solvent) were statistically examined by linear regression with the use of Plackett-Burman and full factorial designs. Final extracts were analyzed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry operating in multiple-reaction monitoring mode. Both the synthetic and ionophoric coccidiostats could be determined in a single run with an analysis time of 5 min. The developed method was validated taking into account the requirements of the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC as a guideline. The method is regarded as applicable for its intended purposes with quantification limits between 0.30 and 2.98 μg kg(-1).

21907019,"Residues of steroid hormones have become a cause for concern because they can affect the biological activity of non-target organisms. Steroid hormones are a potential risk for wildlife and humans through the consumption of contaminated food or water. Their determination requires extraction and clean-up steps, prior to detection, to reach low concentration levels. In recent years, a great effort has been made to develop new analytical methodologies, such as microextraction techniques, that reduce environmental pollution. Researchers have modified old methods to incorporate procedures that use less-hazardous chemicals or that use smaller amounts of them. They are able to do direct analysis using miniaturised equipment and reduced amounts of solvents and wastes. These accomplishments are the main objectives of green analytical chemistry. In this overview, we focus on microextraction techniques for the determination of steroid hormones in biological (e.g., human urine, human serum, fish, shrimp and prawn tissue and milk) and environmental (e.g., wastewaters, surface waters, tap waters, river waters, sewage sludges, marine sediments and river sediments) samples. We comment on the most recent applications in sorptive-microextraction modes, such as solid phase microextraction (SPME) with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), in-tube solid-phase microextraction (IT-SPME), stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) and microextraction in packed sorbent (MEPS).

In addition, the frequency of fish consumption was estimated, because fish is generally the main pathway for human exposure to MeHg. Hair samples were collected from 574 women participating in this study, while cord blood and breast milk samples were collected from 446 and 284 women, respectively. As expected, the levels of THg in hair (median (Med)=297 ng/g, 10th percentile (P10)=73 ng/g, 90th percentile (P90)=781 ng/g), cord blood (Med=1.5 ng/g, P10=0.5 ng/g, P90=4.2 ng/g) and breast milk (Med=0.2 ng/g, P10=0.06 ng/g, P90=0.6 ng/g) were low, due to low consumption of fish (X=25 g/day). A significant linear correlation was found between levels of lnTHg in hair and lnTHg in cord blood (r=0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-0.89), between levels of lnTHg in hair and lnMeHg in cord blood (r=0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.96) and between lnTHg levels in cord blood and lnTHg levels in breast milk (r=0.36, 95% CI: 0.25-0.47). Spearman's rank correlations between the frequency of fish consumption and THg in hair (rs=0.35, 95% CI: 0.28-0.42), and between the frequency of fish consumption and THg in cord blood (rs=0.43, 95% CI: 0.36-0.51) or MeHg in cord blood (rs=0.31, 95% CI: 0.06-0.52) were weak. This could be due to the approximate information on fish consumption obtained from the questionnaires, the high variability of MeHg concentrations in fish and a relatively high proportion of inorganic mercury in the biomarkers which originates from sources other than fish.

Enzymes extracted from whole crustaceans, mainly serine proteases, showed high caseinolytic and moderate clotting activities. Analysis by 2D zymography of the digestive enzymes extracted from Munida hepatopancreas, showed the presence of several isotrypsin- and isochymotrypsin-like enzymes in the range of 20-34 kDa and 4.1-5.8 pI. Moreover, specific enzymatic assays showed the presence of aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases A and B. Overall, optimum activity was achieved at pH 7.5 and 40-45 °C. Caseinolytic activity, determined both spectrophotometrically and by SDS gel electrophoresis, indicated higher activity on β-casein than on α-casein. Miniature cheddar-type cheeses and Pecorino-type cheeses were manufactured by adding starter, rennet and Munida extracts to milk. Reverse-phase HPLC and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry showed a more complex pattern of proteolytic products in cheeses made using Munida instead of chymosin.

Samples were extracted with acetonitrile, purified with liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), and analysed by HLPC-FL previous derivatization with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) in presence of 1-methyl-imidazole (MI) and acetic acid. To date, the presented method is the first validated for the matrix eggs, and in accordance with the requirements set by Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Recoveries of the methods, calculated spiking the samples in the range 5.0-100.0 μg kg(-1), were 64-83% for muscle, 65-89% for milk and 63-84% for eggs. The precision (CV) ranged between 9.2 and 17.1% for muscle, 9.9 and 16.6% for milk and from 9.4 to 17.4% for eggs. Linearity for the six analytes was calculated from 5.0 to 200.0 μg kg(-1). The main advantages of the presented method are its rapidity, the specificity, the good precision and recovery that make it very suitable to the detection and determination of avermectines.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D000089', 'D000097', 'D000818', 'D000977', 'D002851', 'D004531', 'D005463', 'D005504', 'D008892', 'D009132', 'D013050', 'D014269']","['Acetic Anhydrides', 'Acetonitriles', 'Animals', 'Antiparasitic Agents', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Eggs', 'Fluoroacetates', 'Food Analysis', 'Milk', 'Muscles', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Trifluoroacetic Acid']",Validation study on avermectine residues in foodstuffs.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21742111,2011
21679958,"Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is a toxic undesirable compound in milk. AFM1 affinity for caseins causes a concentration effect during milk process for dairy transformation. In spite of this, no official method of analysis, nor maximum tolerance level for aflatoxin M1 in cheese have been established. Thus, the aim of this work was to test the suitability of different HPLC methods for the AFM1 quantification in soft cheese samples at three different contamination levels (low, medium and high, at respectively nearly 30, 100 and 250 ng/kg). Nine participants were selected among Italian laboratories accredited by the Italian accreditation body (ACCREDIA) for HPLC toxin analysis. They were asked to analyze samples applying the method routinely used. The different applied methods were compared, and precision and accuracy parameters were evaluated. The main differences among HPLC procedures were registered at the level of extraction step. The use of an enzymatic digestion for the extraction of the toxin from cheese seemed to be particularly advantageous and the use of immunoaffinity columns seemed to be determinant for the improvement of sensitivity at low contamination levels. In general, the applied methods well discriminated the 3 levels of contamination, even though they performed better at the medium and high concentration levels (100 and 250 ng/kg) than at the low one (30 ng/kg). In fact relative standard deviation for reproducibility at low level was higher (60.1%) than the same value at medium and high levels (22.8% and 28.9%, respectively).",Journal of chromatography.

It was found that mother's dietary exposure to AK in pregnancy or lactation decreased the preference thresholds for AK and sucrose solutions in the adult offspring, whereas the preference pattern and the most preferred concentration for AK or sucrose solution were unchanged. Furthermore, the preference scores in the exposure groups were increased significantly when compared with the control group at a range of concentrations for AK or sucrose solution. The existence of AK and its dynamic changes within 24 h in amniotic fluid during pregnancy or in mother's milk during lactation after a single oral infusion of AK solution were revealed by the methods of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.

21621213,"The present study documents development and validation of a novel approach for determination of 23 perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFASs) in food of animal origin represented by milk and fish. The list of target analytes comprises four classes of PFASs, both ionic and non-ionic: 11 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), 4 perfluorosulphonic acids (PFSAs), 5 perfluorosulphonamides (FOSAs) and 3 perfluorophosphonic acids (PFPAs). Fast sample preparation procedure is based on an extraction of target analytes with acetonitrile (MeCN) and their transfer (supported by inorganic salts and acidification) into the organic phase. Removing of matrix co-extracts by a simple dispersive solid phase extraction (SPE) employing ENVI-Carb and C18 sorbents is followed by an efficient sample pre-concentration performed by acetonitrile evaporation and subsequent dilution of residue in a small volume of methanol (matrix equivalent in the final extracts was 16 and 8 g mL(-1), for milk and fish respectively). Using modern instrumentation consisting of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) hyphenated with a tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS), limits of quantification (LOQs) as low as 0.001-0.006 μg kg(-1) for milk and 0.002-0.013 μg kg(-1) for fish can be achieved. Under these conditions, a wide spectrum of PFASs, including minor representatives, can be determined which enables collecting data required for human exposure studies. The pilot study employing the new method for examination of milk and canned fish samples was realized. Whereas in majority of canned fish products a wide spectrum of PFCAs, perfluorooctanesulphonic acid (PFOS) and perfluoro-1-octanesulphonamide (PFOSA) was detected, only in a few milk samples very low concentrations (LOQ levels) of PFOS and perfluorooctansulphonic acid (PFDS) were found.",Journal of chromatography.

In addition, an experimental study was conducted to determine the possible leaching of Al from cookware in milk during boiling. The obtained results showed that Al concentration in examined bulk farm milk samples was found to be negligible. In contrast, market milk revealed higher concentration, 65.0% of the examined samples were above the PAPLs. The results revealed significant difference of Al concentration among them. The Al levels in processed cheese wrapped in Al foil were significantly higher than those found in samples packed in glass containers with a significant difference of Al concentration between them.

They were capable of hydrolyzing isolated α(S1)-, β-, and κ-casein, of which α(S1)-casein was most susceptible to the enzyme; κ-casein was hydrolyzed with a higher specificity than α(S1)- and β-casein. In addition, the ginger proteases exhibited a similar affinity for κ-casein and higher specificity with increasing temperature. Gel electrophoresis and mass spectra indicated that Ala90-Glu91 and His102-Leu103 of κ-casein were the preferred target bonds of ginger proteases.

21505870,"One of characteristics of diabetes mellitus (DM) is endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and apoptosis which contributes to the development of vasculopathy. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) continuously produced in the setting of DM play an important role in causing EC dysfunction and apoptosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive. Lactadherin, a secreted glycoprotein of milk-fat globule, is expressed by multiple cell types of arterial wall including ECs. Our previous proteomic studies showed that the expression of lactadherin was significantly increased in the aorta of diabetic rats as compared with control rats and treatment with grape seed procyanidin extracts significantly inhibited the lactadherin expression in diabetic rats. We hypothesized that lactadherin plays a critical role in AGEs-induced EC apoptosis; grape seed procyanidin B2 (GSPB2) and resveratrol protect against AGEs-induced EC apoptosis through lactadherin regulation. Our results showed that AGEs upregulated lactadherin expression and lactadherin RNA interference significantly attenuated AGEs-induced EC apoptosis. Overexpression of lactadherin increased EC apoptosis with up-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation suggesting the involvement of mitochondria apoptosis pathway. Mechanistically, overexpression of lactadherin reduced the phosphorylation of GSK3beta at baseline.

Reference compounds were synthesized by enzyme-catalyzed transesterifications. Their identities were confirmed by means of mass spectrometry. Using a medium polar trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane stationary phase, long-chain plant stanyl esters could be separated according to their stanol moieties and their fatty acid chains. Thermal degradation during GC analysis was compensated by determining response factors; calibrations were performed for ten individual plant stanyl esters. For the analysis of low-fat products (skimmed milk drinking yogurts), the GC separation was combined with a ""fast extraction"" under acidic conditions. For fat-based foods (margarines), online coupled LC-GC offered an elegant and efficient way to avoid time-consuming sample preparation steps.

With the aim to compare some nutritional properties of human and donkey milk, the triacylglycerol (TAG) composition and the positional isomers of donkey milk samples were analyzed by HPLC-APCI-MS on reversed phase and silver ion columns. The technique allowed the identification of 72 TAGs in the samples analyzed. Similarities and differences among the TAGs fraction of human and donkey milk can be easily determined by HPLC analysis of the lipid fraction. Donkey milk presents TAGs with partition number (PN) values starting from 30 up to 50. In human milk, the short-chain fatty acids (FAs) are not well-represented and the PN values range between 36 and 52.

We have developed a sensitive and selective mass spectrometry-based method to detect ricin in tap water, 2% milk, apple juice, and orange juice. Ricin added to beverage matrices was extracted using antibody-bound magnetic beads and digested with trypsin. Absolute quantification was performed using isotope dilution mass spectrometry with a linear ion trap operating in product-ion-monitoring mode. The method allows for identification of ricin A chain and B chain and for distinction of ricin from ricin agglutinin within a single analytical run. Ricin-bound beads were also tested for deadenylase activity by incubation with a synthetic ssDNA oligomer. Depurination of the substrate by ricin was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). This method was used successfully to extract ricin from each beverage matrix. The activity of recovered ricin was assessed, and quantification was achieved, with a limit of detection of 10 fmol/mL (0.64 ng/mL).",Analytical chemistry,"['D001628', 'D006801', 'D007553', 'D012276', 'D019032']","['Beverages', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Ricin', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Detection and quantification of ricin in beverages using isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', None, 'methods', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21428278,2011

Detailed procedures were developed for spiking of matrices with (241)Am (alpha radioactivity), (90)Sr/(90)Y (beta radioactivity), and (60)Co, (137)Cs, and (241)Am (gamma radioactivity). Matrix stability studies were performed for 43 days after spiking. The method for liquid foods is based upon rapid digestion, evaporation, and flaming, followed by gas proportional (GP) counting. For the apple matrix, surface radioactivity was acid-leached, followed by GP counting and/or gamma spectrometry. The average leaching recoveries from four different apple brands were between 63% and 96%, and have been interpreted on the basis of ion transport through the apple cuticle. The minimum detectable concentrations (MDCs) were calculated from either the background or method-blank (MB) measurements. They were found to satisfy the required U.S. FDA's Derived Intervention Levels (DILs) in all but one case. The newly developed methods can perform radioactivity screening in foods within a few hours and have the potential to capacity with further automation.

In addition, these compounds may be transferred to edible products of animal origin and as such be a threat for the health of consumers. To investigate the possible transfer of pyrrolizidine alkaloids from contaminated feed to milk, cows were put on a ration for 3 weeks with increasing amounts (50-200 g day(-1)) of dried ragwort. Milk was collected and sampled twice a day; faeces and urine twice a week. For milk, a dose-related appearance of pyrrolizidine alkaloids was found. Jacoline was the major component in milk despite being a minor component in the ragwort material. Practically no N-oxides were observed in milk, notwithstanding the fact that they constituted over 80% of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids in ragwort. The overall carry-over of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids was estimated to be only around 0.1%, but for jacoline 4%. Notwithstanding the low overall carry-over, this may be relevant for consumer health considering the genotoxic and carcinogenic properties demonstrated for some of these compounds.

Three formulations were developed whereby formulation VCO4, VCO8 and VCO12 was substituted with 4%, 8% and 12% of VCO, respectively. The physicochemical properties of ice creams analyzed include overrun, meltdown, pH, titratable acidity, total solid, protein and fat content. The fatty acids profile of VCO formulated ice creams and their stabilities over 3 and 6 weeks storage were studied respectively using gas chromatography (GC). Qualitative descriptive analysis (QDA) and consumer affective test were performed among the trained and untrained panelists. Significant differences (p < 0.05) of overrun, pH, total solid, protein and fat content between ice cream formulations were observed except titratable acidity. Increased VCO content in ice cream formulations lowered the melting resistance of ice cream. For GC analysis, the major fatty acid identified was lauric acid. Upon storage time, the concentration of unsaturated fatty acid decreased but the concentration of saturated fatty acid increased. The result of QDA showed that formulation VCO4, VCO8 and VCO12 were significantly (p < 0.05) different in attributes of color, firmness and smoothness as compared to the control ice cream. Formulation VCO12 was highly accepted by panelists in terms of the acceptance level of appearance, aroma, texture, flavor and overall acceptability.

21337234,"Triclabendazole (TCBZ) is a flukicidal halogenated benzimidazole compound extensively used in veterinary medicine. Liver fluke control in lactating dairy cattle is difficult because treatment should be implemented only during the dry period to avoid milk residues. However, control in endemic areas is usually implemented as regular treatments three to four times a year, even during the lactating period. Thus, information on TCBZ milk excretion and the risk of the presence of drug residues in fluid milk and milk-derivate products is essential. The experimental aims were to evaluate the comparative disposition kinetics of TCBZ and its sulpho-metabolites in plasma and milk in lactating dairy cattle after the oral administration (12 mg kg(-1)) of TCBZ and to assess the pattern of residues in cheese made with milk from treated dairy cows. Both TCBZ sulphoxide and sulphone metabolites but not TCBZ were detected in milk (up to 36 and 144 h, respectively) and plasma (up to 144 h) after oral administration of TCBZ. Residual concentrations of TCBZ sulpho-metabolites were found in cheese made with milk from treated animals. The total average residual concentration in fresh cheese was 13.0-fold higher than that obtained in milk used for its elaboration. The high concentrations of TCBZ sulpho-metabolites recovered in fresh cheese should be seriously considered before milk from treated cows is used for making dairy products.","Food additives & contaminants.

Of 310 premenopausal women screened, 112 (36%) produced at least 10 μL of NAF, the minimum for study participation. In a crossover design, we randomized 96 women to 2 groups who, in reverse order, consumed a high-soy diet with 2 soy servings/d (1 serving = 177 mL soy milk, 126 g tofu, or 23 g soy nuts) and a low-soy diet with <3 servings/wk of soy for 6 mo each separated by a 1-mo washout period. During each diet period, 3 NAF samples were obtained (baseline and 3 and 6 mo) using a FirstCyte Aspirator and 4 urine samples (baseline and 1, 3, and 6 mo) were analyzed for isoflavonoids by liquid chromatography tandem MS. Adherence to the study protocol according to 24-h dietary recalls and urinary isoflavonoid excretion was high. The drop-out rate was 15% (n = 14); 82 women completed the intervention.

While the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping the intestinal microbiota is limited. In this study, LAB were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in Syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in Syria. A total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by comparative 16S rDNA sequencing and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses. Thirty six different species of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella and Pediococcus were identified. RAPD and MALDI-TOF-MS patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. Whereas some species were unique for one source, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. Interestingly, identical RAPD genotypes of L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and P. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies.

21299218,"Sodium chlorate is being developed as a potential food-safety tool for use in the livestock industry because of its effectiveness in decreasing concentrations of certain Gram-negative pathogens in the gastrointestinal tracts of food animals. A number of studies with sodium chlorate in animals have demonstrated that concentrations of chlorate in meat, milk, wastes, and gastrointestinal contents range from parts per billion to parts per thousand, depending upon chlorate dose, matrix, and time lapse after dosing. Although a number of analytical methods exist for chlorate salts, very few were developed for use in animal-derived matrices, and none have anticipated the range of chlorate concentrations that have been observed in animal wastes and products. To meet the analytical needs of this development work, LC-MS, ion chromatographic, and colorimetric methods were developed to measure chlorate residues in a variety of matrices. The LC-MS method utilizes a Cl(18)O(3)(-) internal standard, is applicable to a variety of matrices, and provides quantitative assessment of samples from 0.050 to 2.5 ppm. Due to ion suppression, matrix-matched standard curves are appropriate when using LC-MS to measure chlorate in animal-derived matrices. A colorimetric assay based on the acid-catalyzed oxidation of o-tolidine proved valuable for measuring ≥20 ppm quantities of chlorate in blood serum and milk, but not urine, samples. Ion chromatography was useful for measuring chlorate residues in urine and in feces when chlorate concentrations exceeded 100 ppm, but no effort was made to maximize ion chromatographic sensitivity.

21256992,"The Maillard reaction between lactose and proteins occurs during thermal treatment of milk and lactosylated β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin and caseins have widely been used to monitor the quality of dairy products. We recently demonstrated that a number of other whey milk proteins essential for nutrient delivery, defense against bacteria/virus and cellular proliferation become lactosylated during milk processing. The extent of their modification is associated with the harshness of product manufacturing. Since fat globule proteins are also highly important for the health-beneficial properties of milk, an evaluation of their lactosylation is crucial for a complete understanding of aliment nutritional characteristics. This is more important when milk is the unique dietary source, as in the infant diet. To this purpose, a sequential proteomic procedure involving an optimized milk fat globule (MFG) preparation/electrophoretic resolution, shot-gun analysis of gel portions for protein identification, selective trapping of lactosylated peptides by phenylboronate chromatography and their analysis by nanoLC-ESI-electron transfer dissociation (ETD) tandem MS was used for systematic characterization of fat globule proteins in milk samples subjected to various manufacturing procedures. Significant MFG protein compositional changes were observed between samples, highlighting the progressive adsorption of caseins and whey proteins on the fat globule surface as result of the technological process used. A significant lactosylation of MFG proteins was observed in ultra-high temperature sterilized and powdered for infant nutrition milk preparations, which well paralleled with the harshness of thermal treatment. Globally, this study allowed the identification of novel 157 non-redundant modification sites and 35 MFG proteins never reported so far as being lactosylated, in addition to the 153 ones ascertained here as present on other 21 MFG-adsorbed proteins whose nature was already characterized. Novel MFG proteins include components involved in nutrient delivery, defense response against pathogens and cellular proliferation/differentiation.

21240700,"The purpose of this study was to establish a reliable, cost-effective, fast and simple method to quantify simultaneously both bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol B (BPB) in liquid food matrixes such as canned beverages (soft drinks and beers) and powdered infant formula using dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction (DLLME) with in-situ derivatisation coupled with heart-cutting gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For the optimisation of the DLLME procedure different amounts of various extractive and dispersive solvents as well as different amounts of the derivative reagent were compared for their effects on extraction efficiency and yields. The optimised procedure consisted of the injection of a mixture containing tetrachloroethylene (extractant), acetonitrile (dispersant) and acetic anhydride (derivatising reagent) directly into an aliquot of beverage samples or into an aqueous extract of powdered milk samples obtained after a pretreatment of the samples. Given the compatibility of the solvents used, and the low volumes involved, the procedure was easily associated with GC-MS end-point determination, which was accomplished by means of an accurate GC dual column (heart-cutting) technique. Careful optimisation of heart-cutting GC-MS conditions, namely pressure of front and auxiliary inlets, have resulted in a good analytical performance. The linearity of the matrix-matched calibration curves was acceptable, with coefficients of determination (r2) always higher than 0.99. Average recoveries of the BPA and BPB spiked at two concentration levels into beverages and powdered infant formula ranged from 68% to 114% and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was <15%. The limits of detection (LOD) in canned beverages were 5.0 and 2.0 ng l(-1) for BPA and BPB, respectively, whereas LOD in powdered infant formula were 60.0 and 30.0 ng l(-1), respectively. The limits of quantification (LOQ) in canned beverages were 10.0 and 7.0 ng l-1 for BPA and BPB, respectively, whereas LOQ in powdered infant formula were 200.0 and 100.0 ng l(-1), respectively.

BPB was only detected in canned beverages being positive in 15 of 30 samples analysed (ranging from 0.06 to 0.17 µg l(-1)).

21169440,"Severe intoxications caused by the Bacillus cereus emetic toxin cereulide can hardly be prevented due to the ubiquitous distribution and heat resistance of spores and the extreme thermal and chemical stability of cereulide. It would therefore be desirable to inhibit cereulide synthesis during food manufacturing processes or in prepared foods, which are stored under time-temperature abuse conditions. Toward this end, the impacts of three long-chain polyphosphate (polyP) formulations on growth and cereulide production were examined. The inhibition was dependent on the concentration and the type of the polyP blend, indicating that polyPs and not the orthophosphates were effective. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) monitoring at sublethal concentrations revealed that polyPs reduced the transcription of ces nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes by 3- to 4-fold along with a significantly reduced toxin production level. At lower concentrations, toxin synthesis was decreased, although the growth rate was not affected. These data indicate a differential effect on toxin synthesis independent of growth inhibition. The inhibition of toxin synthesis in food was also observed. Despite the growth of B. cereus, toxin synthesis was reduced by 70 to 100% in two model food systems (reconstituted infant food and oat milk), which were analyzed with HEp-2 cell culture assays and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrospray ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS). Accordingly, ces promoter activity was strongly downregulated, as visualized by using a lux-based reporter strain.

The dairy products came from areas in the central-west (26%), southeast (29%) and south of Brazil (36%) extending as far as Argentina (7%) and the Netherlands (2%). For toxic Pb and Cd, median concentrations in powdered samples were 0.109 mg/kg and 0.033 mg/kg, respectively; in fluid samples median Pb concentration was 0.084 mg/kg, but median Cd concentration was below the limit of detection and overall values were below reference safety levels. However, 62% of these samples presented higher Pb concentration values than those established by FAO/WHO. Although the inverse correlation between Cd and Zn (Spearman r = -0.116; P = 0.590) was not statistically significant, the positive correlation between Ca and Pb was (Spearman r = 0.619; P < 0.0001). Additionally, there was a significant correlation between Pb and Cd. Furthermore, the study also revealed that provision of the essential trace element Zn in infant formulas can provide adequate amounts of the recommended daily requirements. Infant formulas and milk sold for consumption by infants and children can be an efficient tool to monitor neurotoxic metal risk exposure among young children.",International journal of environmental research and public health,"['D000818', 'D001938', 'D002104', 'D004563', 'D006801', 'D007225', 'D007854', 'D057230', 'D008892', 'D013054']","['Animals', 'Brazil', 'Cadmium', 'Electrochemistry', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Lead', 'Limit of Detection', 'Milk', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']","Toxic metals (Pb and Cd) and their respective antagonists (Ca and Zn) in infant formulas and milk marketed in Brasilia, Brazil.","[None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21139877,2011

The present study population consisted of 755 men and 901 women (aged 15-73years) living in 90 different areas of 30 prefectures of Japan. Dietary habits were assessed by inquiring about the consumption frequency of 28 foods, food groups and beverages. In addition, the blood levels of 29 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzo-furans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl (DL-PCBs) congeners were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The median total toxicity equivalent (TEQ) in the blood, which was calculated on the basis of the toxicity equivalency factors of WHO (2005), was 16 pg TEQg(-1) lipid. Principal component analysis identified five dietary patterns: Healthy diet (high intake of vegetables and fruits); Meat/High fat intake (high intake of meat, meat products, and eggs); Seafood and Alcohol (high intake of fish, shellfish, and alcoholic beverages); Miscellaneous; and Milk products and Alcohol intake (high intake of milk, Milk products, and alcoholic beverages). After adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, and smoking habits, the Seafood and Alcohol pattern scores were significantly related to higher blood levels of total TEQ and PCDDs/PCDFs/DL-PCBs, and the Milk products and Alcohol pattern scores were correlated with higher blood levels of DL-PCBs. More detailed analysis showed that the intake frequencies for alcoholic beverages and seafood were independently and positively associated with total TEQ and the TEQ of PCDFs and DL-PCBs.

24779628,"Aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2) are immunosuppressant, mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic agents with a widespread presence in foodstuffs. Since human exposure to aflatoxins occurs primarily by contaminated food intake, and given the greater susceptibility of infants to their adverse effects, the quantification of these mycotoxins in infant food based on cereals is of relevance. Aflatoxin levels were determined in 91 Spanish infant cereals classified in terms of non- and organically produced and several types from 10 different manufacturers, using a extraction procedure followed by inmunoaffinity column clean-up step and HPLC with fluorescence detection (FLD) and post-column derivatisation (Kobra Cell system). Daily aflatoxin intake was also assessed. Preliminary analysis showed a valuable incidence of detected infant cereal samples at an upper concentration level than the detection limit for total aflatoxin (66%), corresponding to a 46, 40, 34 and 11% for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2, respectively. Lower aflatoxin values (median, Q1, Q3) in conventional infant cereal (n = 74, AFB1: <LOD (n.d.; 0.02), AFB2: n.d. (n.d.; 0.01), AFG1: <LOD (n.d.; 0.004), and AFG2: n.d.

In addition, five organic formulations (3.11, 1.98, 0.94, 0.47 and 0.21 µg kg(-1)) exceeded European AFB1 legislation (0.10 µg kg(-1)) versus two conventional cereals (0.35 and 0.12 µg kg(-1)). According to the type of infant cereal, those with cocoa had the highest aflatoxin levels. Gluten-free and cereals with dehydrated fruits had an intermediate level and milk- or honey-based cereals and multi-cereals contained the lowest levels. With the exception of the non-compliant cocoa-based organic formulation, none of the infant cereals analyzed gave a higher intake of 1 ng kg(-1) body weight per day, suggesting that infants fed on infant cereals are exposed to a low health hazard.

21085936,"Four quinolones (danofloxacin, difloxacin, flumequine and marbofloxacin) were determined in milk and egg samples by a simplified high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure using a micellar mobile phase. No extraction was needed to precipitate the proteins from the matrices since they were solubilised in micelles. The only pretreatment steps required were homogenisation, dilution and filtration before injecting the sample into the chromatographic system. An adequate resolution of the quinolones was achieved by a chemometrics approach where retention was modelled as a first step using the retention factors in only five mobile phases. Afterwards, an optimisation criterion was applied to consider the position and shape of the chromatographic peaks. Analytical separation involved a C18 reversed-phase column, a hybrid micellar mobile phase of 0.05 M sodium dodecyl sulphate, 10% (v/v) butanol and 0.5% (v/v) triethylamine buffered at pH 3 and fluorimetric detection.

Levamisole residues were found to concentrate in all cheese types. There was a 3-fold concentration effect for levamisole in mature cheese. Oxyclozanide residues were found to occur at lower levels in soft and hard cheese than milk with a 10-fold concentration in whey cheese compared to milk. The results of this study demonstrate that levamisole and oxyclozanide residues are rapidly excreted in dairy cows and milk is compliant after a few days.

21038852,"As a consequence of the adulteration of infant formulas and milk powders with melamine (MEL) in China in 2008, much attention has been devoted to the analysis of MEL [and cyanuric acid (CA)] in dairy products. Several methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or Raman spectroscopy have been described in the literature. However, no method is available for the simultaneous determination of MEL and CA in other raw materials, which are considered as high-risk materials for economically motivated adulteration. The present paper reports the results of an interlaboratory-based performance evaluation conducted with seven laboratories worldwide. The purpose was to demonstrate the ability of a cleanup-free LC-MS/MS method, originally developed for cow's milk and milk-powdered infant formula, to quantify MEL and CA in egg powder and soy protein. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.02 and 0.05 mg/kg for MEL in egg powder and soy protein, respectively. For CA, LOD and LOQ were 0.05 and 0.10 mg/kg in egg powder and 1.0 and 1.50 mg/kg in soy protein, respectively. Recoveries ranged within a 97-113% range for both MEL and CA in egg powder and soy protein. Reproducibility values (RSD(R)) from seven laboratories were within a 5.4-11.7% range for both analytes in the considered matrices.

Conventional culturing, isolation and identification and a combined PCR-DGGE approach using total cheese DNA extracts and DNA extracts obtained from culturable fractions were employed to monitor viability of the introduced adjuncts and their effect on the cheese microbiota.

Principal component analysis of cheese volatiles determined by steam distillation-extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry could differentiate cheeses made with different concentrations of adjunct R-40926 from the control cheese, and these differences could be correlated to the proteolytic and lipolytic properties of this strain.

20854988,"This work aimed to identify technological steps that can increase fat hydrolysis and volatile compounds production in hard cheeses; these biochemical events have been related with improved piquant taste and development of genuine flavor during cheese ripening. For that purpose, 2 different pretreatments of cheese milk were tested: heat treatment and mechanical agitation. Both factors were assayed at 2 levels: milk was either batch pasteurized or nonthermally treated, and mechanical agitation was either applied or not applied. For all combinations, hard cheeses (Reggianito type) were produced in a pilot plant and ripened for 90 d. In all cheeses the degree of lipolysis, assessed by gas chromatography, increased similarly during ripening. However, the proportion of short-chain fatty acids was higher in the cheeses made with unpasteurized milk, suggesting a higher activity of lipases with positional specificity toward the sn-3 position of the triglyceride, among which milk lipoprotein lipase is found. Similar results were found for most of the volatile compounds, determined by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography flame-ionization detector/mass spectrometry, which constitute the groups of ketones, alcohols, esters, and the group of acids.

20822095,"1,2-Dicarbonyl compounds are formed in food during Maillard and caramelization reactions. 3-Deoxy-D-threo-hexos-2-ulose (3-deoxygalactosone, 3-DGal) and galactosone, two 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds originating from the degradation of galactose, were synthesized and converted to the respective quinoxalines, which were characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Analytical separation of the quinoxalines from the epimeric glucose-derived quinoxalines of 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG) and glucosone was achieved by RP-HPLC on an RP-phenyl column. This method was used to study the relevance of galactose-derived 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds in a variety of foods. 3-DG and 3-DGal were quantified besides 3-deoxypentosone, methylglyoxal, and glyoxal after derivatization with o-phenylenediamine in lactose-hydrolyzed UHT milk, ranging from 2.5 to 18 mg/L and from 2.0 to 11 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of both compounds tended to be higher in other lactose-hydrolyzed food items as well. During storage of lactose-hydrolyzed milk, the concentrations of the 3-deoxyhexosones first increased, but especially the concentration of 3-DGal tended to decrease on prolonged storage, pointing to lower stability of the compound. 3-DGal was also detected in galactose-free food items such as apple juice and beer. The possible formation of 3-DGal from 3-DG by 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene as an intermediate is discussed. Compared to the relatively high concentrations of 3-DG and 3-DGal, 3-deoxypentosone, methylglyoxal, and glyoxal were of only minor quantitative importance in all foods studied.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D003847', 'D005504', 'D005690', 'D015416', 'D008892', 'D011810', 'D021241']","['Animals', 'Deoxyglucose', 'Food Analysis', 'Galactose', 'Maillard Reaction', 'Milk', 'Quinoxalines', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']","3-deoxygalactosone, a ""new"" 1,2-dicarbonyl compound in milk products.","[None, 'Q000031', 'Q000379', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'methods', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20822095,2011

20810123,"The coupling of a High-Temperature Liquid Chromatography system (HTLC) with an Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES) is reported for the first time. This hyphenation combines the separation efficiency of HTLC with the detection power of a simultaneous ICP-AES system and allows the combined determination of organic compound and metals. The effluents of the column were introduced into the spectrometer and the chromatograms for organic compounds were obtained by plotting the carbon emission signal at a characteristic wavelength versus time. As regards metals, they were determined by injecting a small sample volume between the exit of the column and the spectrometer and taking the emission intensity for each one of the elements simultaneously. Provided that in HTLC the effluents emerged at high temperatures, an aerosol was easily generated at the exit of the column. Therefore, the use of a pneumatic nebulizer as a component of a liquid sample introduction system in the ICP-AES could be avoided, thus reducing the peak dispersion and limits of detection by a factor of two. The fact that a hot liquid stream was nebulized made it necessary to use a thermostated spray chamber so as to avoid the plasma cooling as a cause of the excessive mass of solvent delivered to it. Due to the similarity in sample introduction, an Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD) was taken as a reference. Comparatively speaking, limits of detection were of the same order for both HTLC-ICP-AES and HTLC-ELSD, although the latter provided better results for some compounds (from 10 to 20 mg L(-1) and 5-10 mg L(-1), respectively). In contrast, the dynamic range for the new hyphenation was about two orders of magnitude wider. More importantly, HTLC-ICP-AES provided information about the content of both organic (glucose, sucrose, maltose and lactose at concentrations from roughly 10 to 400 mg L(-1)) as well as inorganic (magnesium, calcium, sodium, zinc, potassium and boron at levels included within the 6-3000 mg L(-1)) species.

We determined if there are regional differences in mother's milk levels of these compounds in Sweden. In year 2000-2004, milk was sampled from 204 randomly recruited primiparas from four regions of Sweden. Levels of the compounds were measured by gas chromatography with dual electron-capture detectors. Women were recruited at delivery in three hospitals located in urban areas in southern and central Sweden (Lund, Gothenburg and Uppsala), and in one hospital located in a more rural area in northern Sweden (Lycksele). Information about dietary habits and medical/life-style factors were collected by questionnaires. Among PCB congeners, CB 153, CB 138 and CB 180 showed the highest median concentrations (18-48 ng/g mother's milk lipid), whereas more than 50% of the women had CB 52, CB 101, CB 114, and CB 157 levels below the LOQ (0.3-1.5 ng/g lipid). Median p,p'-DDE levels were in the range of 46-78 ng/g lipid. BDE 47 showed the highest median concentrations (1-2 ng/g lipid) among the brominated compounds, whereas more than 50% of the women had levels of BDE 28, BDE 66, BDE 138, BDE 154, and HBCD below the LOQ (0.05-0.10 ng/g lipid). Regional differences in median organohalogen compound concentrations were small, less than 2-fold. Lycksele women generally had the lowest levels of Σmono-and Σdi-ortho PCBs, mainly due to a lower average age. In contrast, these women had higher tetra- to penta-brominated PBDE levels, but no diet or life-style factor could explain this finding. Wide ranges of PBDEs and HBCD levels (up to 200-fold) were found, especially in the Lycksele area.

Fat-free and whole milk significantly reduced the head-, mouth-, and nose-space concentrations of all volatiles. Water was the major component in milk responsible for the deodorization of volatiles. Due to its higher fat content, whole milk was more effective than fat-free milk in the deodorization of the more hydrophobic volatiles diallyl disulfide and allyl methyl disulfide. Milk was more effective than water and 10% sodium caseinate in the deodorization of allyl methyl sulfide, a persistent garlic odor, in the mouth after garlic ingestion. Addition of milk to garlic before ingestion had a higher deodorizing effect on the volatiles in the mouth than drinking milk after consuming garlic.

In the synthesis, monodispersed SiO(2) nanoparticles (Si-NP) of diameter 80 nm were amino-modified by reaction with 3-aminopropyltriethoxylsilane. The acryloyl monolayer was then grafted onto the amine-modified Si-NP. Finally, the MIP films were coated on to the surface of Si-NP by the copolymerization of the vinyl end groups with functional monomer (acrylamide), cross-linking agent (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate), initiator (azo-bis-isobutyronitrile), and template molecule (sulfamethoxazole). The resulting SiO(2)-SMO-MIP-NP were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The adsorption properties were demonstrated by equilibrium rebinding experiments and Scatchard analysis. The results showed that the binding sites of the SiO(2)-SMO-MIP were highly accessible, and the maximum adsorption capacity of the SiO(2)-SMO-MIP for SMO was 20.21 mg g(-1).

Among congeners of PBDEs, the high and low brominated congeners BDE209, BDE207, BDE197, BDE153, BDE15, BDE28 and BDE47 were the predominant PBDE congeners, accounting for 91%, 90% and 84% of total PBDEs in samples from Shijiazhuang, Tianjin and Yantai, respectively. Based on the results of an in-person interview of mothers using a questionnaire, freshwater fish consumption was found to correlate with total mono-ortho dl-PCBs (mo-PCBs) and sea fish consumption was found to correlate with total non-ortho dl-PCBs (no-PCBs) of human milk in these areas. However, no correlation was found between concentrations of total PBDEs and total TEQ of PCDD/Fs plus dl-PCBs and food consumption.

20552689,"We apply, for first time, the recently developed proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) apparatus as a rapid method for the monitoring of lactic acid fermentation (LAF) of milk. PTR-TOF-MS has been proposed as a very fast, highly sensitive and versatile technique but there have been no reports of its application to dynamic biochemical processes with relevance to the food industry. LAF is a biochemical-physicochemical dynamic process particularly relevant for the dairy industry as it is an important step in the production of many dairy products. Further, LAF is important in the utilization of the by-products of the cheese industry, such as whey wastewaters. We show that PTR-TOF-MS is a powerful method for the monitoring of major volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) formed or depleted during LAF, including acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetoin and 2-propanone, and it also provides information about the evolution of minor VOCs such as acetic acid, 2,3-pentanedione, ethanol, and off-flavor related VOCs such as dimethyl sulfide and furfural. This can be very important considering that the conventional measurement of pH decrease during LAF is often ineffective due to the reduced response of pH electrodes resulting from the formation of protein sediments. Solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) data on the inoculated milk base and final fermented product are also presented to supporting peak identification. We demonstrate that PTR-TOF-MS can be used as a rapid, efficient and non-invasive method for the monitoring of LAF from headspace, supplying important data about the quality of the final product and that it may be used to monitor the efficacy of manufacturing practices.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D000818', 'D005285', 'D019344', 'D048668', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D048249', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Fermentation', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lactobacillus delbrueckii', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Streptococcus thermophilus', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry monitoring of the evolution of volatile compounds during lactic acid fermentation of milk.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20552689,2010

In this paper we have compared the abilities of nine different multivariate classification methods: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), regularized discriminant analysis (RDA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), partial least squares (PLS) classification, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP) - for gasoline classification. Three sets of near infrared (NIR) spectra (450, 415, and 345 spectra) were used for classification of gasolines into 3, 6, and 3 classes, respectively, according to their source (refinery or process) and type. The 14,000-8000 cm(-1) NIR spectral region was chosen. In all cases NIR spectroscopy was found to be effective for gasoline classification purposes, when compared with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or gas chromatography (GC). KNN, SVM, and PNN techniques for classification were found to be among the most effective ones. Artificial neural network (ANN-MLP) approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which was believed to be efficient, has shown much worse results.

20435757,"Existing methods for detection of food-borne pathogens and their toxins are frequently time-consuming, require specialized equipment, and involve lengthy culture procedures and/or animal testing and are thus unsuitable for a rapid response to an emergency public health situation. A series of simple and rapid affinity immunochromatography column (AICC) assays were developed to detect Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin types A, B, E, and F and Escherichia coli O157 in food matrices. Specifically, for milk, grape juice with peach juice, and bottled water, the detection limit for the botulinum neurotoxin type A complex was 0.5 ng. Use of this method with a 10-ml sample would therefore result in a detection limit of 50 pg ml(-l). Thus, this assay is approximately 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive than a comparable lateral-flow assay. For botulinum neurotoxin complex types B, E, and F, the minimum detection limit was 5 ng to 50 ng. Sensitive detection of E. coli O157 was achieved, and the detection limit was 500 cells. The AICC test was also shown to be specific, rapid, and user friendly. This test takes only 15 to 30 min to complete without any specialized equipment and thus is suitable for use in the field.

20412896,"Milk serum protein concentrates (SPC) are proteins found in cheese whey that are removed directly from milk. Because SPC are not exposed to the cheese-making process, enzymatic or chemical reactions that can lead to off-flavors are reduced. The objectives of this study were to identify and compare the composition, flavor, and volatile components of 80% protein SPC and whey protein concentrates (WPC). Each pair of 80% SPC and WPC was manufactured from the same lot of milk and this was replicated 3 times. At each replication, spray-dried product from each protein source was collected. Commercial 80% WPC were also collected from several manufacturers for sensory and volatile analyses. A trained sensory panel documented the sensory profiles of the rehydrated powders. Volatile components were extracted by solid-phase microextraction and solvent extraction followed by solvent-assisted flavor evaporation with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-olfactometry. Consumer acceptance testing of acidified 6% protein beverages made with 80% SPC and WPC produced in the pilot plant and with WPC from commercial sources was conducted. The SPC was lower in fat and had a higher pH than the WPC produced in the pilot plant or commercial WPC. Few sensory differences were found between the rehydrated SPC and WPC manufactured in this study, but their flavor profiles were distinct from the flavor of rehydrated commercial WPC. The pilot-plant WPC had higher concentrations of lipid oxidation products compared with SPC, which may be related to the higher fat content of WPC. There was a large difference in appearance between 80% SPC and WPC: solutions of SPC were clear and those of WPC were opaque. Concentrations of lipid oxidation products in commercial WPC were generally higher than those in pilot-plant SPC or WPC. Sensory profiles of the peach-flavored protein beverage included cereal, free fatty acid, and soapy flavors and bitter taste in beverages made from pilot-plant products, whereas cardboard flavors were detected in those made with commercial WPC.

Non-controlled pH, starting from 5.6 to 3.5, was the optimal condition for L. curvatus DPPMA10. Temperature of 30 degrees C was also found to be optimal. Solid surfaces (agar culture media) stimulated attached bacteria to synthesize EPS (> or = of two-fold, P<0.05) with respect to planktonic cells (broth media). The highest production of EPS (ca. 46-50 g/kg of wet medium) was found during growth as attached cells in WFH agar supplemented with glucose, sucrose or molasses, mineral salts and fresh yeast extract at 30 degrees C for 48 h. As shown by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, glucose was the only hydrolysis end-product for EPS synthesized during 48 h of incubation. The EPS synthesized by L. curvatus DPPMA10 improved the quality of bread and was utilized as carbon course by intestinal strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.

20339844,"Mycotoxins are natural contaminants produced by a range of fungal species. Their common occurrence in food and feed poses a threat to the health of humans and animals. This threat is caused either by the direct contamination of agricultural commodities or by a ""carry-over"" of mycotoxins and their metabolites into animal tissues, milk, and eggs after feeding of contaminated hay or corn. As a consequence of their diverse chemical structures and varying physical properties, mycotoxins exhibit a wide range of biological effects. Individual mycotoxins can be genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and oestrogenic. To protect consumer health and to reduce economic losses, surveillance and control of mycotoxins in food and feed has become a major objective for producers, regulatory authorities and researchers worldwide. However, the variety of chemical structures makes it impossible to use one single technique for mycotoxin analysis. Hence, a vast number of analytical methods has been developed and validated. The heterogeneity of food matrices combined with the demand for a fast, simultaneous and accurate determination of multiple mycotoxins creates enormous challenges for routine analysis. The most crucial issues will be discussed in this review.

Pasteurized bovine milk (3.9% fat) was packed in 2 different atmospheres (air and N(2)) and exposed to light for 20 h at 4 degrees C under 8 transparent filters with different light transmission properties. The following transparent, noncolored, and colored filters based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used: noncolored (PET), noncolored with 2 different UV-block regions, yellow, green, amber, orange, and red. Control samples were stored in darkness and in a carton. Sensory evaluation showed off flavors significantly increased in milk stored under all filters compared with the control samples. Variation in atmosphere resulted in significant differences in formation of rancid flavor in milk stored under different filters. Milk samples stored in N(2) underwent the most sensory deterioration under orange and red filters, whereas milk samples stored in air were most deteriorated under noncolored filters. According to the oxidation compounds measured by gas chromatography, milk samples stored under noncolored and orange filters were highly oxidized, whereas red, green, and amber filters offered better protection against photooxidation. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to examine the degradation of photosensitizers (riboflavin, protoporphyrin, and chlorophyllic compounds) in the milk samples. Degradation of protoporphyrin and chlorophyllic compounds in N(2) correlated well with sensory properties related to photooxidation (R(2)=0.75-0.95).

The clean-up process was optimized using seven standard phosphatidylcholines including two lyso derivatives. Different acidic conditions were tested for the bonding and washing steps; for elution, various aqueous or methanolic bases were studied. Experiments were conducted hydrodynamically using extraction cartridges, and statically in batch mode; the performance of the sorbent was significantly better when used in the flow-through mode. The developed clean-up procedure was used to selectively enrich phosphatidylcholines from whole milk, human plasma, and mouse plasma, to show the wide applicability of the method. For the preceding extraction of total lipids from the matrix, different solvent mixtures (methanol-chloroform, methanol-methyl tert-butyl ether, and ethanol-ethyl acetate) were compared. Accuracy and reproducibility of the proposed sample-preparation procedure were evaluated. Matrix effects possibly affecting mass spectrometric analysis were studied before and after the solid-phase extraction.

20038704,"Lipolysis plays an important role in the formation of cheese flavor. In Emmental cheese, the main part of lipolysis has been associated with the presence of Propionibacterium freudenreichii, a species used as a ripening culture. Our aim was to identify the most probable lipolytic esterase(s) involved in cheese lipolysis by P. freudenreichii. Since cheese lipolysis mainly occurs during P. freudenreichii growth, we hypothesized that P. freudenreichii possesses secreted lipolytic esterase(s). For 12 putative esterase genes previously identified from the genome of P. freudenreichii CIRM1, the level of expression was quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, and the subcellular localization of esterases was predicted in silico. The esterase activity in extracellular and intracellular extracts of P. freudenreichii was characterized by zymography, and the extracellular esterases were identified by mass spectrometry. Finally, the best candidate was overexpressed in the same strain. All of the 12 genes encoding putative esterases were expressed. Esterase PF#279 was predicted to be secreted in the medium, PF#774 to be surface exposed, and the 10 remaining putative esterases to be intracellular. Zymography revealed that esterase activities in culture supernatant differed from the ones detected in intracellular extracts. PF#279 was identified as the sole esterase present in culture supernatant. Transformed P. freudenreichii CIRM1 clones overexpressing PF#279 showed 5 to 8 times more lipolytic activity on milk fat than the wild-type strain. Combining in silico, biochemical, and genetic approaches, we showed that PF#279 is the sole secreted esterase in P. freudenreichii and is active on milk fat.

These attributes provide lactoferricin and other natural bioactive peptides with the potential to be functional food ingredients that can be used by the food industry in a variety of applications. At present, commercial uses of these types of compounds are limited by the scarcity of information on their ability to survive food processing environments. We have monitored the degradation of lactoferricin during its incubation with two types of lactic acid bacteria used in the yogurt-making industry, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, with the aim of assessing the stability of this milk protein-derived peptide under simulated yogurt-making conditions. Analysis of the hydrolysis products isolated from these experiments indicates degradation of this peptide near neutral pH by lactic acid bacteria-associated peptidases, the extent of which was influenced by the bacterial strain used. However, the data also showed that compared to other milk-derived bioactive peptides that undergo complete degradation under these conditions, the 25-amino acid lactoferricin is apparently more resistant, with approximately 50% of the starting material remaining after 4 h of incubation.

19788278,"A reagentless bioactive paper-based solid-phase biosensor was developed for detection of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, including organophosphate pesticides. The assay strip is composed of a paper support (1 x 10 cm), onto which AChE and a chromogenic substrate, indophenyl acetate (IPA), were entrapped using biocompatible sol-gel derived silica inks in two different zones (e.g., sensing and substrate zones). The assay protocol involves first introducing the sample to the sensing zone via lateral flow of a pesticide-containing solution. Following an incubation period, the opposite end of the paper support is placed into distilled deionized water (ddH(2)O) to allow lateral flow in the opposite direction to move paper-bound IPA to the sensing area to initiate enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of the substrate, causing a yellow-to-blue color change. The modified sensor is able to detect pesticides without the use of any external reagents with excellent detection limits (bendiocarb approximately 1 nM; carbaryl approximately 10 nM; paraoxon approximately 1 nM; malathion approximately 10 nM) and rapid response times (approximately 5 min).

19782373,"Animal-derived products are particularly vulnerable to contamination by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These lipophilic substances, which are generated by an increasing number of sources, are easily transferred to the atmosphere, water, soil, and plants. They are ingested by livestock and become trapped in the fat fraction of edible animal tissues. The aim of this work was to determine the occurrence, risk for human health and entryways of benzenic and halogenated VOCs (BHVOCs) in meat products, milks and sea foods using gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques. In the first part, the occurrence and levels of the BHVOCs in animal products were studied. One muscle and three fat tissues were analysed by GC-Quad/MS in 16 lambs. Of 52 BHVOCs identified, 46 were found in the three fat tissues and 29 in all four tissues, confirming that VOCs are widely disseminated in the body. Twenty-six BHVOCs were quantified in fat tissues, and risk for consumer health was assessed for six of these compounds regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The BHVOC content was found to be consistent with previous reports and was below the maximum contaminant levels set by the EPA. In the second part, the performance of GCxGC-TOF/MS for comprehensively detecting BHVOCs and showing their entryways in animal-derived food chains was assessed. Meat, milk and oysters were analysed by GC-Quad/MS and GCxGC-TOF/MS. For all these products, at least a 7-fold increase in the contaminants detected was achieved with the GCxGC-TOF/MS technique. The results showed that the production surroundings, through animal feeding or geographical location, were key determinants of BHVOC composition in the animal products.",Journal of chromatography.

19762792,"The objectives of this study were to identify and compare the composition, flavor, and volatile components of serum protein concentrate (SPC) and whey protein concentrate (WPC) containing about 34% protein made from the same milk to each other and to commercial 34% WPC from 6 different factories. The SPC and WPC were manufactured in triplicate with each pair of serum and traditional whey protein manufactured from the same lot of milk. At each replication, SPC and WPC were spray dried (SD) and freeze dried (FD) to determine the effect of the heat used in spray drying on sensory properties. A trained sensory panel documented the sensory profiles of rehydrated SD or FD powders. Volatile components were extracted by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and solvent extraction followed by solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE) with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-olfactometry. Whey protein concentrates had higher fat content, calcium, and glycomacropeptide content than SPC. Color differences (Hunter L, a, b) were not evident between SPC and WPC powders, but when rehydrated, SPC solutions were clear, whereas WPC solutions were cloudy. No consistent differences were documented in sensory profiles of SD and FD SPC and WPC. The SD WPC had low but distinct buttery (diacetyl) and cardboard flavors, whereas the SD SPC did not. Sensory profiles of both rehydrated SD products were bland and lower in overall aroma and cardboard flavor compared with the commercial WPC. Twenty-nine aroma impact compounds were identified in the SPC and WPC. Lipid and protein oxidation products were present in both products. The SPC and WPC manufactured in this study had lower total volatiles and lower concentrations of many lipid oxidation compounds when compared with commercial WPC. Our results suggest that when SPC and WPC are manufactured under controlled conditions in a similar manner from the same milk using the same ultrafiltration equipment, there are few sensory differences but distinct compositional and physical property differences that may influence functionality. Furthermore, flavor (sensory and instrumental) properties of both pilot-scale manufactured protein powders were different from commercial powders suggesting the role of other influencing factors (e.g., milk supply, processing equipment, sanitation).",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002118', 'D002364', 'D002611', 'D002849', 'D005223', 'D005511', 'D005612', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D009812', 'D010446', 'D012677', 'D012903', 'D013649', 'D000067816']","['Animals', 'Calcium', 'Caseins', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Fats', 'Food Handling', 'Freeze Drying', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Odorants', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Sensation', 'Smell', 'Taste', 'Whey Proteins']","Comparison of composition, sensory, and volatile components of thirty-four percent whey protein and milk serum protein concentrates.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19762792,2009

19709866,"The influence of two different dietary patterns on maternal fatty acid (FA) intake on the composition of umbilical cord blood plasma phospholipids and transitional breast milk was investigated. A 7-day dietary record was completed in the last trimester of pregnancy by women living in an inland and a coastal area of south-eastern China. The FA composition in maternal diet was calculated using the 2002 Chinese food composition database. Cord blood and transitional breast milk samples were collected and their FA composition was analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. Mothers in the coastal area showed higher intake of long-chain polyunsaturated FA (LCPUFA) including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6omega) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA,20:5omega3) but lower linoleic acid (LA, 18:2omega6) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3omega3) than the mothers in the inland area. The intake of arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4omega6) did not differ between the two areas. LA, ALA, AA and DHA in breast milk of day 5 reflected the maternal diet except that the EPA content in breast milk at day 5 was similar for the areas. LA, ALA and AA were lower and EPA higher in umbilical cord plasma phospholipids in infants from the costal compared to the inland area. There were significant differences in maternal intakes of FA confirming different dietary habits, which influenced the FA composition of cord plasma phospholipids and transitional breast milk. Since FA influence gene expression the found variation implies that the long-term follow-up of this cohort will be interesting.","Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids","['D000328', 'D044466', 'D015331', 'D004032', 'D004041', 'D005227', 'D005247', 'D005260', 'D005312', 'D006801', 'D007231', 'D039382', 'D008895', 'D009035', 'D011247', 'D055815']","['Adult', 'Asians', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Milk, Human', 'Mothers', 'Pregnancy', 'Young Adult']","Fatty acid composition of diet, cord blood and breast milk in Chinese mothers with different dietary habits.","[None, None, None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000032', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'pharmacology', 'analysis', 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'drug effects', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709866,2010

19691936,"Recent reports describing the presence of lead (Pb) in lipsticks have suggested that, under ordinary use, the potential amount of Pb exposure is harmful. To permit independent assessment of the Pb contamination, a method for determining total Pb in lipstick using microwave-assisted digestion and analysis employing inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was developed and validated. Since lipsticks may contain fats, oils, pigments, dyes, and minerals, several reference materials (RM) were analyzed, including coal, wear metals in oil, organic Pb in oil, milk powder, and estuarine sediment. With the exception of the RM with mineral content (estuarine sediment), complete recovery of Pb from the RMs was obtained by simple nitric acid (HNO(3)) digestion. Complete recovery of Pb from estuarine sediment was achieved only when hydrofluoric acid (HF) was added to the digestion mix, followed by treatment with excess boric acid (H(3)BO(3)) to neutralize the HF and to dissolve insoluble fluorides. Commercial lipsticks were tested for total Pb by the validated method. The detection limit was estimated to be 0.04 microg Pb/g. The average value obtained for the lipsticks was 1.07 microg/g. Undigested material was present in some lipstick digests when only HNO(3) was used, and generally lower Pb values were obtained.

19673501,"A homemade novel nanoextractive electrospray ionization (nanoEESI) source has been characterized for in situ mass spectrometric analysis of ambient samples without sample pretreatment. The primary ions generated using a nanospray emitter interact with the neutral sample plume created by manually nebulizing liquid samples, allowing production of the analyte ions in the spatial cross section of the nanoEESI source. The performance of nanoEESI is experimentally investigated by coupling the nanoEESI source to a commercial LTQ mass spectrometer for rapid analysis of various ambient samples using positive/negative ion detection modes. Compounds of interest in actual samples such as aerosol drug preparations, beverages, milk suspensions, farmland water, and groundwater were unambiguously detected using tandem nanoEESI ion trap mass spectrometry. The limit of detection was low picogram per milliliter levels for the compounds tested. Acceptable relative standard deviation (RSD) values (5-10%) were obtained for direct measurement of analytes in complex matrixes, providing linear dynamic signal responses using manual sample introduction. A single sample analysis was completed within 1.2 s. Requiring no sheath gas for either primary ion production or neutral sample introduction, the nanoEESI has advantages including readiness for miniaturization and integration, simple maintenance, easy operation, and low cost.

19664467,"This paper describes a fast method for the sensitive and selective determination of melamine in a wide range of food matrices, including several milk-based products. The method involves an extraction with aqueous 1% trichloroacetic acid before the injection of the 10-fold diluted extract into the liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) system, using labelled melamine as the internal standard. As melamine is present in aqueous media in the cationic form, the chromatographic separation in reversed-phase LC requires the use of anionic ion-pair reagents, such as tridecafluoroheptanoic acid (THFA). This allows a satisfactory chromatographic retention and peak shape in all the types of food samples investigated. The method has been validated in six food matrices (biscuit, dry pasta and four milk-based products) by means of recovery experiments in samples spiked at 1 and 5 mg kg(-1). Average recoveries (n=5) ranged from 77% to 100%, with excellent precision (RSDs lower than 5%) and limits of detection between 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg(-1). In addition, accuracy and robustness of the method was proven in different soya-based matrices by means of quality control (QC) sample analysis. QC recoveries, at 1 and 2.5 mg kg(-1), were satisfactory, ranging from 79% to 110%. The method developed in this work has been applied to the determination of melamine in different types of food samples. All detections were confirmed by acquiring two MS/MS transitions (127>85 for quantification; 127>68 for confirmation) and comparing their ion intensity ratio with that of reference standards. Accuracy of the method was also assessed by applying it to a milk-based product and a baking mix material as part of an EU proficiency test, in which highly satisfactory results were obtained.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D000818', 'D001628', 'D002851', 'D005466', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D006538', 'D008892', 'D052616', 'D053719', 'D014227']","['Animals', 'Beverages', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Heptanoic Acids', 'Milk', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triazines']",Determination of melamine in milk-based products and other food and beverage products by ion-pair liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19664467,2009

Proxy measures were used to assess Fe and Zn bioavailability and protein digestibility of a bean recipe (fríjol sancochado) and a maize-milk recipe (mazamorra) prepared with enhanced or conventional crops in Colombia. Fe concentration was similar in the cooked NEB and CB and in NEM and CM (P> or = 0.05); in vitro Fe dialyzability was similar in cooked NEB (9.52%) and CB (9.72%) and greater for NEM (37.01%) than CM (32.24%). Zn concentration was higher in the uncooked and cooked NEB than in the CB (P < 0.05); phytate: Zn molar ratios were high in cooked NEB (36: 1) and CB (47: 1), suggesting low Zn bioavailability, and not different from each other (P = 0.07). There were no differences in Zn concentration or phytate: Zn molar ratio in the maize recipes. Nitrogen, tryptophan, and lysine concentrations were higher in the cooked NEM than CM; nitrogen was higher in the cooked NEB than CB (P < 0.05). In vitro protein digestibility was comparable (82% to 83%) for NEM and CM and higher for NEB (84%) than for CB (82%).

19609510,"Residual antimicrobials in food constitute a risk to human health. Although epidemiological data on the real magnitude of their adverse effects are very scarce, they indicate that food could be an important vehicle for evolution and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Public health agencies in many countries rely on detection by mass spectrometry (MS) for unambiguous identification of residues of antimicrobial agents in animal food products for human consumption. The introduction of relatively inexpensive and robust liquid chromatography (LC)-MS systems has given a strong impulse to the development of confirmatory methods for the above medicines in foodstuffs. The initial part of this review, after a brief introduction into the field of antimicrobials, is dedicated to the most important EU regulations and directives for control of residues of these substances in animal products. The main attention in this review is on the sample-treatment and MS detection systems in use today for analysing the most important classes of antimicrobials in various biological matrices (milk, animal tissues, eggs, and honey). As evidenced by this review, reversed-phase LC combined with tandem MS, usually triple-quadrupole MS (QqQMS), is currently the preferred technique in most residue analysis of a single-class of antimicrobials. A recently emerging analytical strategy is that of developing methods for detecting a large variety of veterinary drugs belonging to different classes, including pesticides (multi-class residue analysis). To do this, simple and generic extraction and separation techniques applicable to a broad range of compounds differing in physical and chemical properties have been adopted. Such methods are still based mainly on LC-QqQMS. Emerging alternative MS detection systems are time-of-flight MS, which provides accurate mass of the analyte(s), or Q-linear ion trap (IT) MS that eliminates some limitations of ITMS(n).",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D000900', 'D002853', 'D004350', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D013058']","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Drug Residues', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry']",Recent applications of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to residue analysis of antimicrobials in food of animal origin.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379']","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19609510,2010

19573873,"The paper describes a sample clean-up method for the co-isolation of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZON), two mycotoxins naturally co-occurring in wheat. The method is based on immunoaffinity columns prepared by co-immobilising anti-DON and anti-ZON antibodies in a porous sol-gel glass. The main task in developing the method consisted in finding a loading medium allowing retention of both analytes as well as a common elution medium for the dissociation of both antigen-antibody complexes formed. This can be achieved by co-extracting DON and ZON with ACN-water (60:40, v/v), reducing the acetonitril concentration to 2.5% before loading an aliquot of the diluted sample extract onto the DON/ZON column. The columns are washed with 5 ml of MeOH-water (10:90, v/v) before DON and ZON are co-eluted with 4 ml of ACN-water (50:50, v/v). Concentrations of DON and ZON are determined with HPLC-UV and HPLC-fluorescence detection, respectively. The sample clean-up method was shown to be applicable to wheat and wheat products, e.g., cornflakes, milk wheat mash and rusk.

Both intestinal microbiota and barrier function seem to be disturbed in patients with food allergies, and administration of probiotics has been shown to normalize intestinal microbiota and alleviate symptoms. We hypothesized that the differences in intestinal metabolic activity and permeability could lead to detectable changes in the end-products of metabolism in patients with CMA. This could offer new diagnostic possibilities. The urinary concentrations of 37 organic acids were studied by a mass spectrometry-based method in 35 infants aged under 1 yr with atopic eczema, 16 of them having CMA diagnosed with a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge test. The control group consisted of the remaining 19 infants with only atopic eczema. In a second study, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) or placebo was administered to the infants with CMA for 4 wk and the urinary organic acids were analysed again. CMA patients and patients with only atopic eczema had statistically significant differences in urinary concentrations of hydroxybutyrate (p<0.001); adipate and isocitrate (p<0.01 for both); homovanillate, suberate, tartarate, 3-indoleacetate and 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (p<0.05 for all). These concentrations did not change significantly following LGG administration to the CMA patients, but a trend towards the control group was seen.

19323583,"Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are important constituents of dietary fats. While cis-configurated isomers belong to the classic fatty acids of food, trans-fatty acids are suspected to pose a risk to human health. In either case, a thorough assessment of both positional and geometrical isomers of MUFAs is an important task in food and life sciences. For this purpose, a method suitable for routine analysis was developed. After lipid extraction and conversion of fatty acids into corresponding fatty acid methyl esters, cis and trans isomers of MUFAs were separated on silver-ion-impregnated cartridges. Fractions containing either cis- or trans-MUFAs were determined by gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring (GC/EI-MS-SIM) mode using [M-32](+) as quantification ions and [M-74](+) as well as M(+) as qualifier ions. A total of 14 MUFAs were available as reference standards, but a total of 40 MUFAs (22 cis and 18 trans isomers) were identified with high selectivity in samples of cheese, goat fat, human milk, and cod liver oil. The 18:1 and 16:1 isomers contributed most to both the cis- and trans-MUFAs. Application of internal standards allowed for the quantification of MUFAs only in the food samples. The amount of trans-fatty acids was determined to be 0.9- 4.3 g/100 g, with the lowest levels in human milk fat and the highest levels in Roquefort cheese. After exclusion of oleic acid, the concentrations of trans- and cis-MUFAs were at the same level in samples from ruminants and human milk fat.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D003060', 'D003611', 'D005229', 'D008401', 'D006041', 'D006801', 'D007536', 'D008895', 'D012680', 'D021241']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Cod Liver Oil', 'Dairy Products', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Goats', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Milk, Human', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Quantitation of cis- and trans-monounsaturated fatty acids in dairy products and cod liver oil by mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379']","[None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19323583,2009
19307613,"The safeguard of river buffalo Mozzarella cheese, a Protected Designation of Origin dairy product, has prompted an analytical study to trace the milk and curd used as raw material in cheesemaking. This is to prevent the illegal use of milk or curd from different geographical areas outside of those indicated in the official production protocol. For this purpose, we studied primary proteolysis occurring in fresh and frozen milk and curd to identify a molecular marker that could indicate the raw material used. Whole casein from frozen river buffalo milk was separated using cation-exchange chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE, and a protein component with an estimated molecular weight of 15.3 kDa was detected. This protein component was revealed in fresh river buffalo milk as a faint electrophoresis band, which drastically increased in intensity in refrigerated and frozen milk as well as in curd and was found to be associated with beta-CN through hydrophobic interaction. By using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight peptide mass mapping, this component was identified as the C-terminal fragment f(69-209) of beta-CN (expected molecular weight of 15,748.8 Da). beta-Casein f(69-209), originating from the early hydrolysis of Lys(68)-Ser(69) by plasmin, has no counterpart in bovine milk. The increased rate of hydrolysis by plasmin toward the cleavage site Lys(68)-Ser(69) has to be ascribed to the elevated proline content of the peptide 61-73. The favored production of beta-CN f(69-209) has also drawn attention to the complementary proteose peptone beta-CN f(1-68) that is presumed to play a physiological role in inducing milk secretion similar to that of beta-CN f(1-29). The higher in vivo and in vitro production rate, compared with gamma(1)-CN formation, indicates that beta-CN f(69-209) and its complementary fragment are candidate molecular markers to evaluate milk and curd freshness.

19126424,"Although the concentrations of the toxic metal cadmium in breast milk are generally low (< 1 microg/L), experimental studies indicated neurobehavioral and endocrine effects in the suckling offspring. The aim of the present study was to elucidate how cadmium is transported to breast milk by assessing interactions with essential micronutrients. The study is nested into a food and micronutrient supplementation trial conducted among pregnant women in Matlab, a rural area in Bangladesh, where malnutrition is prevalent and the cadmium exposure is relatively high. We measured cadmium in breast milk (BM-Cd; median 0.14 microg/kg; range <0.050-1.0 microg/kg), in erythrocytes (Ery-Cd; median 1.5 microg/kg; range 0.46-4.8 microg/kg) and in urine (U-Cd; median 0.63 microg/L; range 0.050-4.5 microg/L), using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). We found a significant positive association between Ery-Cd and BM-Cd and a breast milk-plasma ratio of approximately 3-4, indicating no barrier against cadmium transport from plasma to breast milk. BM-Cd was positively associated with manganese (r(s)=0.56; p<0.01) and iron (r(s)=0.55; p<0.01) in breast milk, but not with plasma ferritin. On the other hand, BM-Cd was negatively associated with BM-Ca (r(s)=-0.17; p=0.05), indicating that cadmium inhibits the transport of calcium to breast milk. In conclusion, the present study may indicate that cadmium shares common transporters with iron and manganese for transfer to breast milk, but inhibits secretion of calcium to breast milk.",Toxicology,"['D000328', 'D001459', 'D001692', 'D002104', 'D002118', 'D027682', 'D004781', 'D004785', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007501', 'D042361', 'D008345', 'D013058', 'D018977', 'D008895', 'D011247', 'D012424', 'D055815']","['Adult', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Transport', 'Cadmium', 'Calcium', 'Cation Transport Proteins', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron', 'Mammary Glands, Human', 'Manganese', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Micronutrients', 'Milk, Human', 'Pregnancy', 'Rural Population', 'Young Adult']",Cadmium interacts with the transport of essential micronutrients in the mammary gland - a study in rural Bangladeshi women.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000009', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'adverse effects', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'adverse effects', None, None, 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19126424,2009
19112561,"Within the scope of a joint project to study soil-to-plant carryover of polyfluorinated compounds (PFCs), five cultivated plants (spring wheat, oats, potatoes, maize, and perennial ryegrass) were sown or planted in Mitscherlich pots. Six variants per species were used, each with a different concentration level of PFOA and PFOS (from 0.25 to 50 mg/kg as aqueous solution) to detect possible concentration dependence in the transfer of these two PFCs from soil to plant. PFOA and PFOS were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after appropriate sample preparation (partial drying, mincing, homogenizing, extraction). Since PFOA and PFOS presently represent the most widely studied PFCs, they are classified as ""leading compounds."" The results show that concentrations of PFOA/PFOS in the plants vary greatly, depending on the concentrations applied to the soil. PFOA values were higher than PFOS values in all plants except potatoes, in which these differences could be quite substantial. From the results presented here it can be seen that uptake and storage are much more intensive in the vegetative portion of the plant than relocation in the storage organs. This is particularly evident from the the comparison of concentrations found in the grain and ear and those in the straw or rest of the plant in spring wheat, oats, and maize. Transfer from ""soil to crops"" provides a possible explanation for the presence of PFCs in foodstuffs and in human body fluids such as blood, plasma, serum, or breast milk.

19109300,"This study investigated the potential application of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR 4,000-900 cm(-1)) for the determination of milk coagulation properties (MCP), titratable acidity (TA), and pH in Brown Swiss milk samples (n = 1,064). Because MCP directly influence the efficiency of the cheese-making process, there is strong industrial interest in developing a rapid method for their assessment. Currently, the determination of MCP involves time-consuming laboratory-based measurements, and it is not feasible to carry out these measurements on the large numbers of milk samples associated with milk recording programs. Mid-infrared spectroscopy is an objective and nondestructive technique providing rapid real-time analysis of food compositional and quality parameters. Analysis of milk rennet coagulation time (RCT, min), curd firmness (a(30), mm), TA (SH degrees/50 mL; SH degrees = Soxhlet-Henkel degree), and pH was carried out, and MIR data were recorded over the spectral range of 4,000 to 900 cm(-1). Models were developed by partial least squares regression using untreated and pretreated spectra. The MCP, TA, and pH prediction models were improved by using the combined spectral ranges of 1,600 to 900 cm(-1), 3,040 to 1,700 cm(-1), and 4,000 to 3,470 cm(-1). The root mean square errors of cross-validation for the developed models were 2.36 min (RCT, range 24.9 min), 6.86 mm (a(30), range 58 mm), 0.25 SH degrees/50 mL (TA, range 3.58 SH degrees/50 mL), and 0.07 (pH, range 1.15). The most successfully predicted attributes were TA, RCT, and pH. The model for the prediction of TA provided approximate prediction (R(2) = 0.66), whereas the predictive models developed for RCT and pH could discriminate between high and low values (R(2) = 0.59 to 0.62). It was concluded that, although the models require further development to improve their accuracy before their application in industry, MIR spectroscopy has potential application for the assessment of RCT, TA, and pH during routine milk analysis in the dairy industry. The implementation of such models could be a means of improving MCP through phenotypic-based selection programs and to amend milk payment systems to incorporate MCP into their payment criteria.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D012085', 'D006863', 'D016014', 'D008892', 'D013055']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chymosin', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Linear Models', 'Milk', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared']","Prediction of coagulation properties, titratable acidity, and pH of bovine milk using mid-infrared spectroscopy.","[None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19109300,2009

Sample extraction was carried out with and without additional column cleanup procedures, and the final determination was made using GC with electron-capture detector (ECD). The pesticide identity was confirmed using GC-MS in the SIM mode. Since there were minor differences between the extraction procedures, extraction without the additional cleanup procedure was used throughout the work.

Some compounds, such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), come partly from the mother's diet and are produced by the mother's body and secreted into the milk. Although several studies have examined the effect of chronic CLA supplementation on breast milk CLA appearance, little is known about the transfer of food CLA to breast milk over the short term. The objective of this study was to conduct a preliminary analysis of the kinetics of CLA appearance in breast milk over the short term. Seven women expressed breast milk at 4- to 6-hour intervals for 2 days after eating either CLA-enriched (1912 mg CLA) or control (231 mg CLA) cookies. Milk samples were freeze-dried, fatty acid methyl esters were prepared using methanolic-potassium hydroxide (KOH), and CLA isomers were quantified by gas chromatography. Analysis revealed the following: (1) CLA enrichment of total fatty acids in the breast milk for 48 hours post ingestion of the CLA-enriched cookies was 2.9-fold above control; (2) total breast milk CLA content for 48 hours post CLA-enriched cookies ingestion was 46% greater than post CLA-moderate cookies ingestion; (3) after ingestion of the CLA-enriched cookies, breast milk CLA enrichment plateaued between 8 to 28 hours. This preliminary study suggests that breast milk fatty acids are enriched in CLA compared to control within 28 hours after the ingestion of a CLA-rich food product and invites further research on the extent and timing with which breast milk composition reflects dietary CLA content.","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)","['D000328', 'D004032', 'D002149', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007700', 'D044243', 'D008875', 'D008895', 'D010865']","['Adult', 'Diet', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Middle Aged', 'Milk, Human', 'Pilot Projects']",Human breast milk enrichment in conjugated linoleic acid after consumption of a conjugated linoleic acid-rich food product: a pilot study.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19083443,2009

Salmonella serovars (Anatum, Enteritidis, Heidelberg, Kentucky, Muenchen, and Typhimurium), most of which were represented by multiple strains, were grown in tryptic soy broth (24 h at 42 degrees C), diluted to 10(2) to 10(3) CFU/ml, and filtered using HGMFs. The membranes were incubated on Miller-Mallinson agar (24 h at 42 degrees C), and typical Salmonella colonies were sonicated in 50% acetonitrile and centrifuged. Resulting pellets were vacuum dried on a ZnSe crystal and analyzed using IR spectroscopy. Alternatively, the membranes containing Salmonella growth were removed from the agar, vacuum dried, and colonies were analyzed directly by IR microspectroscopy. Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) models were developed from spectra. The method was validated by analyzing Salmonella-inoculated tomato juice, eggs, milk, and chicken. Salmonella serovars exhibited distinctive and reproducible spectra in the fingerprint region (1,200 to 900 cm(-1)) of the IR spectrum. SIMCA permitted distinguishing Salmonella strains from each other through differences in bacterial lipopolysaccharides and other membrane components. The model correctly predicted Salmonella in foods at serovar (100%) and strain (90%) levels.

An earthy/bell pepper (EBP) flavor has been previously recognized in some of these cheeses. This study characterized the alkylmethoxypyrazine compounds causing EBP flavor in Farmstead Cheddar cheeses. Eight cheeses were divided into inner, outer, rind, and wrapper sections, and tested for descriptive sensory and instrumental analyses. To assess reproducibility of EBP flavor, cheeses from the same facilities were purchased and tested after 6 and 12 mo. EBP flavor was detected in four out of 8 Farmstead Cheddar cheeses by a trained sensory panel. 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine were identified as the main sources of EBP flavor in these cheeses by GC/O and GC/MS. In general, those alkylmethoxypyrazines were prevalent in the wrapper (106 to 730 ppb) and rind (39 to 444 ppb) sections of the cheeses. They were either not detected in inner and outer sections of the cheeses or were present at low concentrations. These results suggest that 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine are formed near the surface of the cheeses and migrate into the cheese during ripening. Threshold values in water and whole milk were 1 and 16 ppt for 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine, and 0.4 and 2.3 ppt for 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, respectively.

Body weight, food intake and urine were periodically collected. Tissue samples were collected when the mice were killed and the composition was determined. Expression of uncoupling proteins was determined by Western blotting. Mineral content was measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry.

The HPH milk treatment induced a significant increase of the cheese yield and caused a reduction of enterococci, lactococci and yeasts in the curds. Enterococci cell loads remained at lower levels in cheeses obtained from HPH milk over the ripening period. Analyses of free fatty acids, Sodium Dodecil Sulphate (SDS)-PAGE profiles, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Solid Phase Microextraction (GC-MS-SPME) measurements of volatile compounds and sensory traits evidenced that the pressure treatment can be regarded also as a useful tool to differentiate products obtained from the same raw material.

An IDL of 200fgmul(-1) injected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5:1 for tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was obtained by gas chromatography coupled to a quadrupole ion storage mass spectrometer in tandem mode (GC/MS/MS). Coupling large volume programmable temperature vaporizer (PTV-LV) injection to GC/MS/MS provides an alternative and complementary method to classical splitless-GC injection connected to high-resolution mass spectrometry (splitless-GC/HRMS) method for dioxin monitoring in food and feed. An injection volume of 10mul was found to be the best compromise between the sensitivity requirements and the robustness required for a high throughput method. PTV-LV-GC/MS/MS and Splitless-GC/HRMS were compared by performing analysis on five different matrices such as beef fat, yolk eggs, milk powder, animal feed and serum samples covering a concentration range of two orders of magnitude (i.e. 0.2-25ng WHO-TEQkg(-1)). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out. Fisher tests pointed out that the method effect for all the 2,3,7,8 congeners was not significant, indicating that the null hypothesis (H(0): mu(1)=mu(2)=...=mu(n)) was not rejected.

18967590,"5-Vinyl-1,3-oxazolidine-2-thione (5-VOT) is a goitrogenic compound released by enzymatic degradation of progoitrin, the most important glucosinolate occurring in rapeseed meal. This paper describes an analytical method for determining the 5-VOT in complex matrices. The method proposed by Quinsac et al. [J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem., 75(3) (1992) 529] has been improved by modification of the extraction conditions and the purification steps. The extraction of 5-VOT is performed with hot acid buffer. The first purification step is achieved by solid-phase chromatography (C(18)). The second purification step of 5-VOT is carried out by complexation with phenyl mercury acetate in cyclohexane and, afterwards, by decomplexation using an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate. These reactions move 5-VOT from an aqueous to an organic medium, and then back again to the aqueous phase. This procedure ensures a high purification efficiency. The precise quantification of 5-VOT is completed in 12 min by reverse-phase liquid chromatography (C(18)), using an isocratic elution with an ultraviolet detector and with synthetic 4,4-dimethyl-1,3-oxazolidine-2-thione as internal standard. Using this modified method, 5-VOT can be determined in different matrices such as rapeseed meal, animal diets, muscle, several organs (thyroid, liver, kidney and lung) and biological fluids (plasma and milk). The quantification limit of 5-VOT in the sample is of 1 ppb (1 mug kg(-1)), the recovery rate of 5-VOT is about 90% and the repeatability is over 97%.",Talanta,[],[],"Analysis of 5-vinyl-1,3-oxazolidine-2-thione in complex matrices at ppb level.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18967590,2012
18946131,"A survey was conducted to determine the occurrence of mycotoxins in feedstuffs of dairy cows in the Netherlands and to estimate total dietary intakes of these compounds. Twenty-four dairy farms were visited twice and samples taken of all diet ingredients. Feed intake data were collected by means of questionnaires. A total of 169 feed samples were collected and analyzed for 20 mycotoxins using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry multimethod. Silage and compound feed were the main diet ingredients, representing on average 67 and 23% of dry matter intake, respectively. Deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid were the mycotoxins with the highest incidence. The incidence of DON in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 38 to 54%. The incidence of zearalenone in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 17 to 38%. The DON and zearalenone had a low incidence in forage samples and were not detected in ensiled by-product samples. Roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid were only detected in silage and ensiled by-product samples (incidence 7 to 19%). Fumonisins B(1) and B(2) were detected in 2 compound feed samples and one feed commodity sample. Aflatoxins B(1), B(2), G(1), and G(2), ochratoxin A, T-2 and HT-2 toxin, 3-acetyl-DON, 15-acetyl-DON, diacetoxyscirpenol, sterigmatocystin, fusarenon-X, ergotamine, and penicillinic acid were not detected in any of the samples. Average concentrations of DON, zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid in complete diets were 273, 28, 114, and 54 microg/kg, respectively. Maximum concentrations were 969, 203, 2,211, and 1,840 microg/kg, respectively. Calculated average daily intakes of these mycotoxins were 5.0, 0.5, 2.0, and 0.9 mg/animal, respectively, and maximum daily intakes 19.3, 3.5, 38.9, and 32.3 mg/animal, respectively. Corn silage was the major source of all 4 of these mycotoxins in the diet. Extremely high concentrations of roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid (up to 45 and 25 mg/kg, respectively) were detected in visibly molded areas in surface layers of corn silage. These areas appeared to be the main source of roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid in the diet.

18657303,"The present investigation was carried out to assess the trace mineral profile of milk from lactating cows reared around different industrial units and to examine the effect of blood and milk concentration of lead and cadmium on copper, cobalt, zinc and iron levels in milk. Respective blood and milk samples were collected from a total of 201 apparently healthy lactating cows above 3 years of age including 52 cows reared in areas supposed to be free from pollution. The highest milk lead (0.85+/-0.11 microg/ml) and cadmium (0.23+/-0.02 microg/ml) levels were recorded in lactating cows reared around lead-zinc smelter and steel manufacturing plant, respectively. Significantly (P<0.05) higher concentration of milk copper, cobalt, zinc and iron compared to control animals was recorded in cows around closed lead cum operational zinc smelter. Analysis of correlation between lead and other trace elements in milk from lactating cows with the blood lead level>0.20 microg/ml (n=79) revealed a significant negative correlations between milk iron and milk lead (r=-0.273, P=0.015). However, such trend was not recorded with blood lead level<0.20 microg/ml (n=122). The milk cobalt concentration was significantly correlated (r=0.365, P<0.001) with cadmium level in milk and the highest milk cadmium (>0.10 to 0.39 microg/ml) group had significantly (P<0.05) increased milk cobalt.

Solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography techniques have been shown to be useful tools in the quantification of individual free fatty acids in dairy products providing enough sensitivity to detect levels of rancidity in milk. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the short-chain and medium-chain free fatty acid profile in i) raw untreated goat milk; ii) raw goat milk passing through pumps and heating units (plate-and-frame heat exchanger and ohmic heater); and iii) processed goat milk by conventional and ohmic pasteurization to determine the influence of each treatment in the final quality of the milk. Multivariate statistical analysis has shown that the treatments studied were not responsible for the variability found on free fatty acid contents. In particular, it was possible to conclude that ohmic pasteurization at 72 degrees C for 15 s did not promote an extended modification of free fatty acid contents in goat milk when compared with that of conventional pasteurization. Furthermore, principal component analysis showed that the capric acid can be used to discriminate goat's milk with different free fatty acid concentrations.

26003373,"Coumarin is a component of natural flavourings including cassia, which is widely used in foods and pastries. The toxicity of coumarin has raised some concerns and food safety authorities have set a maximum limit of 2mg/kg for foods and beverages in general, and a maximum level of 10mg/l for alcoholic beverages. An efficient method for routine analysis of coumarin is liquid chromatography with diode array detection. The optimal sample preparation for foods containing cinnamon was investigated and found to be cold extraction of 15g sample with 50mL of methanol (80%, v/v) for 30min using magnetic stirring. In the foods under investigation, appreciable amounts of coumarin were found in bakery products and breakfast cereals (mean 9mg/kg) with the highest concentrations up to 88mg/kg in certain cookies flavoured with cinnamon. Other foods such as liqueurs, vodka, mulled wine, and milk products did not have coumarin concentrations above the maximum level. The safety assessment of coumarin containing foods, in the context of governmental food controls, is complicated as a toxicological basis for the maximum limits appears to be missing. The limits were derived at a time when a genotoxic mechanism was assumed. However, this has since been disproven in more recent studies. Our exposure data on coumarin in bakery products show that there is still a need for a continued regulation of coumarin in foods. A toxicological re-evaluation of coumarin with the aim to derive scientifically founded maximum limits should be conducted with priority.

The six PBDEs targeted were chosen on criteria of toxicity and occurrence in environmental matrices. Three methods of extraction were tested and compared in terms of lipid recovery yields and repeatability. The sample preparation process includes two steps: extraction by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and purification by solid phase extraction (SPE). The preferred method of extraction used a hexane/methylene chloride/methanol (5 : 2 : 1, v/v) solvent mixture. Three extraction cycles were carried out per sample at a temperature of 80 degrees C and a pressure of 1500 psi. The method was validated on milk cream samples spiked with the specified PBDEs. Recoveries for the whole sample preparation process (extraction and cleanup) for cream samples spiked at 10 and 100 ng g(-1) were greater than 80% (ranging from 81 to 106%) at both concentrations for BDE-99, -100, -153 and 154. Recoveries were lower (ranging from 65 to 75%) for BDE-28 and BDE-47. PBDEs were quantified by GC/MS detection with selected ion monitoring (SIM) using three ions formed by electron capture.

24784536,"The occurrence of mycotoxins in 140 maize silages, 120 grass silages and 30 wheat silages produced in the Netherlands between 2002 and 2004 was determined using a liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS) multi-method. Deoxynivalenol (DON) was detected above the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 250 μg kg⁻¹ in 72% of maize and 10% of wheat silages. Average DON concentrations were 854 and 621 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, and maximum concentrations 3142 and 1165 μg kg⁻¹, respectively. Zearalenone was detected above the LOQ of 25 μg kg⁻¹ in 49% of maize and 6% of grass silages. Average zearalenone concentrations were 174 and 93 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, and maximum concentrations 943 and 308 μg kg⁻¹, respectively. The incidences and average concentrations of DON and zearalenone in maize silage were highest in 2004. The incidence of other mycotoxins was low: fumonisin B1 and 15-acetyl-DON were detected in 1.4 and 5% of maize silages, respectively, and roquefortin C in 0.8% of grass silages. None of the silages contained aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, T2-toxin, HT2-toxin, sterigmatocystin, diacetoxyscirpenol, fusarenon-X, ergotamine, penicillinic acid, or mycophenolic acid. This study demonstrates that maize silage is an important source of DON and zearalenone in the diet of dairy cattle. Since the carryover of these mycotoxins into milk is negligible, their occurrence in feed is not considered to be of significant concern with respect to the safety of dairy products for consumers.

Perchlorate-contaminated waters may lead to human exposure through drinking water and food chain transfer in crops by way of irrigation water. Perchlorate has been found in dairy milk collected nationally and internationally. This study was conducted to evaluate perchlorate in the feed-dairy continuum in the southwestern United States. All feed products collected at dairies in this study had detectable levels of perchlorate as analyzed by ion chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The calculated total perchlorate intake across dairies ranged from 1.9 to 12.7 mg/cow per day. The variation in total perchlorate intake across dairies was largely associated with variation in forage and silage products. Alfalfa products were the single most important source of perchlorate intake variability among dairies. The estimated perchlorate intake from drinking water ranged from 0.01 mg per cow per day and was generally less than 2% of the total perchlorate intake. The perchlorate content of milk ranged from 0.9 to 10.3 microg/L and was similar to levels reported by the Food and Drug Administration's Total Diet Study.

The objective of this study was to evaluate potential perchlorate exposure from food crops produced in the lower Colorado River region (LCRR). The major food commodities produced in the region were sampled and perchlorate levels were determined by ion chromatography followed by detection using either conductivity or tandem mass spectrometry, depending on analyte levels.

18471861,"A sensitive magnetic particle enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) was developed to analyze polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in water, milk, fish, and soil samples. The assay was rapid and can be used to analyze fifty samples in about 1h after sample cleanup. The assay has a limit of detection (LOD) below 0.1 ppb towards the following brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) congeners: BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-28, BDE-100, and BDE-153, with the LOD approximately the same as GC-NCI-MS. The congeners most readily recognized in the ELISA were BDE-47 and BDE-99 with the cross-reactivities of BDE-28, BDE-100, and BDE-153 being less than 15% relative to BDE-47. As anticipated, the sensitivities are proportional to the similarities between the hapten structure and the BDE congener structure. Some oxygenated congeners with structural similarity to the hapten showed high to moderate cross-reactivities. Very low cross-reactivity was observed for other PBDEs or chlorinated environmental contaminants. The assay gave good recoveries of PBDEs from spiked water samples and a very small within and between day variance. Comparison with GC-NCI-MS demonstrated the ELISA method showed equivalent precision and sensitivity, with better recovery. The lower recovery of the GC-NCI-MS method could be caused by the use of an internal standard other than an isotopically substituted material that could not be used because of the fragmentation pattern observed by this method. The cleanup methods prior to ELISA were matrix dependent, no pretreatment was needed for environmental water samples, while fish, milk, and soil samples required various degrees of cleanup. Analysis of this wide variety of environmental samples by both ELISA and GC-MS demonstrated ELISA provides a timely and cost-effective method to screen for PBDEs in a variety of samples.",Chemosphere,"['D000818', 'D002849', 'D004777', 'D004797', 'D005260', 'D005399', 'D005504', 'D055768', 'D006801', 'D008280', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D010647', 'D011075', 'D012680', 'D012987', 'D014867']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fishes', 'Food Analysis', 'Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers', 'Humans', 'Magnetics', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Phenyl Ethers', 'Polybrominated Biphenyls', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Soil', 'Water']",Development of a magnetic particle immunoassay for polybrominated diphenyl ethers and application to environmental and food matrices.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18471861,2008

The results show that milk does not significantly affect the total amount of metabolites excreted in urine. However, differences in metabolite excretion profiles were observed; there were changes in the glucuronide and sulfate excretion rates, and the sulfation position between the period of excretion and the matrix.

Sensory analysis of cheeses flavor discriminated K. lactis cheeses on only 2 attributes (acetaldehyde and alcohol odors). This study shows that yeast contribution is species-specific and that K. lactis, at a population of 10(6) viable cells/g, can influence Cantalet cheese flavor.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000596', 'D002611', 'D015169', 'D005230', 'D005516', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D007716', 'D009812', 'D010843']","['Amino Acids', 'Cheese', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified', 'Food Microbiology', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Kluyveromyces', 'Odorants', 'Pichia']",Kluyveromyces lactis but not Pichia fermentans used as adjunct culture modifies the olfactory profiles of Cantalet cheese.,"['Q000032', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000254', None, 'Q000254']","['analysis', 'microbiology', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'growth & development', None, 'growth & development']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18218739,2008
18218734,"The concentration of the most relevant polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners has been determined in milk and dairy products (i.e., cheese and yogurt, from cow, goat, and ewe). In addition, the enantiomeric composition of 11 atropisomeric PCB has been determined for the first time in this type of product, using heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatography and 2 enantioselective columns for the unambiguous determination of both enantiomers. Results showed a deviation from the racemic composition for PCB 135, 136, 176, 171, and 183 in the samples analyzed. Whereas PCB 135, 136, and 176 showed an enrichment of the first eluted enantiomer, congeners 171 and 183 showed an enrichment of the first or second eluted enantiomer depending on the dairy product and species. The remaining congeners analyzed (PCB 84, 91, 95, 132, 149, and 174) did not present a clear enrichment of any of the enantiomers. Therefore, differences in the enantiomeric composition of some of the target atropisomeric PCB have been found among the 3 species and among the milk samples and the related dairy products analyzed. Enantioselective species-dependent processes, as well as enantioselective processes carried on by microorganisms during the fermentation and ripening in the latter could be possible explanations for the differences observed.

18215649,"The spontaneous formation of the neurotoxic carcinogen acrylamide in a wide range of cooked foods has recently been discovered. These foods include bread and other bakery products, crisps, chips, breakfast cereals, and coffee. To date, the diminutive size of acrylamide (71.08 Da) has prevented the development of screening immunoassays for this chemical. In this study, a polyclonal antibody capable of binding the carcinogen was produced by the synthesis of an immunogen comprising acrylamide derivatised with 3-mercaptobenzoic acid (3-MBA), and its conjugation to the carrier protein bovine thyroglobulin. Antiserum from the immunised rabbit was harvested and fully characterised. It displayed no binding affinity for acrylamide or 3-MBA but had a high affinity for 3-MBA-derivitised acrylamide. The antisera produced was utilised in the development of an ELISA based detection system for acrylamide. Spiked water samples were assayed for acrylamide content using a previously published extraction method validated for coffee, crispbread, potato, milk chocolate and potato crisp matrices. Extracted acrylamide was then subjected to a rapid 1-h derivatisation with 3-MBA, pre-analysis. The ELISA was shown to have a high specificity for acrylamide, with a limit of detection in water samples of 65.7 microgkg(-1), i.e. potentially suitable for acrylamide detection in a wide range of food commodities. Future development of this assay will increase sensitivity further.

18213472,"To determine sulphamethazine (SMZ) residues in edible animal foods (pig muscle, chicken muscle, egg, fish, milk and liver), a competitive direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a colloidal gold immunoassay were established. The limits of detection of the ELISA and the colloidal gold immunoassay were 0.02 and 0.5 microg kg(-1), respectively. The specificity of the ELISA developed to the SMZ was high according to the results of cross-reactivity testing with 14 kinds of sulphonamides. To obtain a more sensitive immunoassay, buffer solution (30 mmol L(-1) phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.5) was optimized through the whole test procedure. A simple and efficient extraction method for the rapid detection of SMZ residues in foods was developed, with recoveries between 74 and 117.5%. Matrix effects can be avoided by 1:10 dilution of pig muscle, chicken muscle, egg, fish, milk and liver with optimal buffer. The detection limit of SMZ was 5 microg kg(-1) in liver and 2 microg kg(-1) in the other five samples. For the validation of the ELISA tests, sample extracts were analysed by ELISA and high-performance liquid chromatography. The results obtained by these two methods showed a good correlation (r(2)) which was greater than 0.9.

18188738,"Human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is due to that found in the diet, and BPA and its metabolites were detected at parts per billion (or less) concentrations in human urine, milk, saliva, serum, plasma, ovarian follicular fluid, and amniotic fluid. Adverse health effects in mice and rats may be induced after parenteral injection or after massive oral doses. Controlled ingestion trials in healthy adult volunteers with 5 mg d16-BPA were unable to detect parent BPA in plasma despite exquisitely sensitive (limit of detection = 6 nM) methods, but by 96 h 100% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the glucuronide. The extensive BPA glucuronidation following ingestion is not seen after parenteral injection; only the parent BPA binds plasma proteins and estrogen receptors (ER). The hypothesis that BPA dose-response may be described by a J- or U-shape curve was not supported by toxicogenomic data collected in fetal rat testes and epididymes (after repeated parenteral exposure at 2-400,000 microg/kg-d), where a clear monotonic dose-response both in the numbers of genes and magnitude of individual gene expression was evident. There is no clear indication from available data that the BPA doses normally consumed by humans pose an increased risk for immunologic or neurologic disease. There is no evidence that BPA poses a genotoxic or carcinogenic risk and clinical evaluations of 205 men and women with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-verified serum or urinary BPA conjugates showed (1) no objective signs, (2) no changes in reproductive hormones or clinical chemistry parameters, and (3) no alterations in the number of children or sons:daughters ratio. Results of benchmark dose (BMD10 and BMDL10) calculations and no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) inspections of all available and reproducible rodent studies with oral BPA found BMD and NOAEL values all greater than the 5 mg/kg-d NOAELs from mouse and rat multigeneration reproduction toxicity studies. While allometric and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were constructed for interspecies scaling of BPA and its interaction with ER, multigeneration feeding studies with BPA at doses spanning 5 orders of magnitude failed to identify signs of developmental toxicity or adverse changes in reproductive tract tissues; the 5-mg/kg-d NOAELs identified for systemic toxicity in rats and mice were less than the oral NOAELs for reproductive toxicity. Thus, it is the generalized systemic toxicity of ingested BPA rather than reproductive, immunologic, neurobehavioral, or genotoxic hazard that represents the point of departure. Using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uncertainty factor guidance and application of a threefold database uncertainty factor (to account for the fact that the carcinogenic potential of transplacental BPA exposure has yet to be fully defined and comprehensive neurobehavioral and immunotoxicologic evaluations of BPA by relevant routes and at relevant doses have yet to be completed) to the administered dose NOAEL results in an oral RfD of 0.016 mg/kg-d. Assuming the 70-kg adult consumes 2 L of water each day and adopting the default 20% U.S. EPA drinking water relative source contribution yields a 100 microg/L BPA total allowable concentration (TAC).","Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

18096925,"The aim of this experiment was to study the effect of the addition, to milk, of an essential oil (EO) obtained from the hydrodistillation of plants collected from a mountain natural pasture on the milk and cheese sensory properties. The EO was mainly composed of terpenoid compounds (67 of the 95 compounds identified) as well as ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, alkanes, and benzenic compounds. In milk, the addition of this EO at the concentration of 0.1 microL/L did not influence its sensory properties, whereas at 1.0 microL/L, sensory properties were modified. In cheeses, the effect of adding EO into milk was studied in an experimental dairy plant allowing the production of small Cantal-type cheeses (10 kg) in 3 vats processed in parallel. The control (C) vat contained 110 L of raw milk; in the other 2 vats, 0.1 microL/L (EO1) or 3.0 microL/L (EO30) of EO were added to 110 L of the same milk. Six replicates were performed. After 5 mo of ripening, chemical and sensory analyses were carried out on the cheeses, including determination of the volatile compounds by dynamic headspace combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The EO did not influence the sensory properties of the cheeses at the lower concentration (EO1). However, the EO30 cheeses had a more intense odor and aroma, both characterized as ""mint/chlorophyll"" and ""thyme/oregano."" These unusual odors and aromas originated directly from the EO added. In total, 152 compounds desorbing from cheese were found, of which 41 had been added with the EO; in contrast, 54 compounds of the EO were not recovered in the cheese. Few volatile compounds desorbing from cheeses, other than the added compounds, were affected by EO addition. Among them, 2-butanol, propanol, and 3-heptanone suggested a slight effect of the EO on lipid catabolism.

This opens a new avenue for an increase in milk consumption and may replace taking pills. Milk beverages enriched with various nutraceutical ingredients (soy isoflavones, glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, creatine, and lactoferrin) were thermally processed at different combinations of temperatures from 72 to 138 degrees C for different holding times using a Microthermics pilot plant thermal processing unit and were incubated at refrigeration, room, or elevated storage temperatures. Residual concentrations of the active compounds were measured by high performance liquid chromatography or by immunodifusion (for lactoferrin) and degradation kinetics were determined.

Interestingly, there has been an increased consumption of dietary supplements containing this element in the form of either inorganic or organic compounds. The effect of using selenium as a dietary supplement in yogurt has been evaluated. For this purpose, different concentrations of inorganic Se (ranging from 0.2 to 5000 microg g(-1)) have been added to milk before the fermentation process. Biotransformation of inorganic Se into organic species has been carefully evaluated by ion-exchange, reversed-phase, or size-exclusion chromatography, coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Yogurt fermentation in the presence of up to 2 microg g(-1) of Se(IV) produces a complete incorporation of this element into proteins as has been demonstrated applying a dialysis procedure. Analysis by SEC-ICP-MS showed that most of them have a molecular mass in the range of 30-70 kDa.

Cheese samples were collected from three communities, (Tafo, Asawasi, and Aboabo), yoghurt samples from K-Poly and Ayeduasi while yoghurt and milk samples were collected from KNUST. Concentrations of DDT and DDE were, respectively, 42.17+/-6.00 microg kg(-1) and 31.50+/-3.44 microg kg(-1) in cheese sampled from Asawasi. Cheese samples from Tafo had an average DDT concentration of 298.57+/-28.02 microg kg(-1) while DDE concentration was 140.15+/-56.77 microg kg(-1).

Four peptides were chosen and investigated as biomarkers taking into account their selectivity, the absence of missed cleavages, the uniform distribution in the Ara h 2 and Ara h 3/4 protein isoforms together with their spectral features under ESI-MS-MS conditions, and good repeatability of LC retention time.

In this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. The objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in vitro and in situ assays. Milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid 8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. In addition, the tolerance to salts (NaCl and KCl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. Four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. In in vitro assays, most strains acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. Fast strains decreased milk pH to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. This group consisted mostly of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. Approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. Peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. Most strains showed salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. The Lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. In both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming or equaling primary starter. Overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products.

An analytical method based on GC-MS/MS was developed for steroid measurement at an ultra-trace level in food products. The limits of detection for oestrogens were about 5 and 30 ng kg(-1) in milk and eggs, respectively. For androgens, the limits of detection were around 10 and 50 ng kg(-1) in milk and eggs, respectively. The method was applied to milk and egg samples collected in a French supermarket. In milk, oestrone was found at levels between 100 and 300 ng l(-1), while 17beta-oestradiol levels were estimated to be near 20 ng l(-1). 17alpha-testosterone was found to be from 50 ng l(-1) in skimmed milk to 85 ng l(-1) in whole milk. In egg samples, oestrone and 17beta-oestradiol were found at 1.5 and 0.9 microg kg(-1), respectively, while 17alpha-oestradiol was found to be in lower concentrations (i.e. around 0.55 microg kg(-1)). Regarding androgens, 17alpha- and 17beta-testosterone were estimated at 1.9 and 1.3 microg kg(-1), respectively. These results represent a first attempt to estimate the food exposure to steroid hormones.

Improvements over previous methods were achieved by the use of a rugged and inexpensive C18 column, a multi-mode OASIS HLB solid-phase extraction cartridge for sample clean-up, and acetic acid for pH adjustment and protein precipitation. The hydrophobicity of the perchlorate anion gives it good retention and separation characteristics on C18 chromatographic columns. The C18 column allowed for the use of 90% of acetonitrile at a low flow rate (0.3 ml min(-1)), without splitting, and could also be regenerated with organic solvents, unlike an ion-exchange column. Perchlorate levels in selected commercial food samples were: <1.0-2.1 ng g(-1) (fruit and vegetable juices, reported here for the first time), <1.0-5.0 ng g(-1) (milk), and <1.0 ng g(-1) (bottled water).",Food additives and contaminants,"['D001628', 'D002853', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D010472', 'D053719']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Perchlorates', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Trace analysis of perchlorate anion in selected food products by reverse-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'methods', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17852386,2008

Macrolides were extracted from food samples by acetonitrile or phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.0), and sample extracts were further cleaned up using solid-phase extraction cartridges. UPLC/Q-Tof data were acquired in Tof MS full scan mode that allowed both quantification and confirmation of macrolides, and identification of their degradation products. LC/MS/MS data acquisition was achieved using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), i.e. two transitions, to provide a high degree of sensitivity and repeatability. Matrix-matched standard calibration curves with the use of roxithromycin as an internal standard were utilized to achieve the best accuracy of the method. Both techniques demonstrated good quantitative performance in terms of accuracy and repeatability. LC/MS/MS had advantages over UPLC/Q-Tof MS in that its limits of detection were lower and repeatability was somewhat better. UPLC/Q-Tof provided ultimate and unequivocal confirmation of positive findings, and allowed degradation product identification based on accurate mass.

17722167,"A wide range of anti-hypertensive peptides potentially able to lower blood pressure through the inhibition of vasoactive enzymes such as angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) are known. Currently, ACE-inhibitory peptides can be produced from precursor proteins via enzymatic hydrolysis by proteolytic enzymes, or food fermentation with proteolytic starter cultures. These approaches are neither selective nor easy. In this study a novel procedure has been developed, based on recombinant DNA technologies, for the production of highly purified fractions of three polypeptides derived from bovine beta-casein active as ACE inhibitors in vitro. The procedure includes peptide expression in Escherichia coli cells as recombinant fusion proteins, purification by affinity chromatography, cleavage by proteinase from a selected strain of Lactobacillus helveticus and isolation of bioactive peptides (BPs). The reported concentration of inhibitor needed to reduce at 50% ACE activity (IC(50)) values for single BP calculated in inhibiting the ACE enzyme gave results in agreement with the same parameters available in literature for other milk-derived BPs. This procedure could be used to obtain quantities of pure peptides to determine their interactions with ACE, with the aim of designing peptides that have stronger inhibitory properties and exhibit new pharmacological profiles.

We determined in young goats whether a diet partly containing soy protein differently affects intestinal morphology and the jejunal and hepatic proteome as compared with a milk diet. Fourteen male 2-wk-old White German dairy goat kids were fed comparable diets based on whole cow's milk in which 35% of the crude protein was casein (milk protein group; MP) or soy protein supplemented by indispensable AA (SPAA) for 34 d (n = 7/group). Body weight gain and food efficiency were not different. Jejunal and hepatic tissue was collected to determine intestinal morphology by microscopy and protein repertoire by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Jejunal crypt depth was reduced and villus height to crypt depth ratio was higher in SPAA than in milk protein. Out of 131 proteins identified, 32 proteins were found to be differently expressed in both groups. In SPAA, down-regulated jejunal proteins were involved in processes related to cytoskeleton generation, protein, lipid, and energy metabolism. Downregulated hepatic proteins were related to glycolysis and Krebs cycle. Thirteen proteins were upregulated in SPAA. Among these, 2 hepatic proteins were related to carbohydrate breakdown. The other 11 jejunal proteins were involved in cytoskeleton assembly, proteolysis, and carbohydrate breakdown. In addition, glutathione-S-transferase was found to be upregulated in the medial jejunum.

Samples were then subjected to in vitro digestion simulating gastric and small intestinal conditions with pre- and post-digestion catechin profiles assessed by HPLC. Catechin stability in green tea was poor with <20% total catechins remaining post-digestion. EGC and EGCG were most sensitive with less, not double equals 10% recovery. Teas formulated with 50% bovine, soy, and rice milk increased total catechin recovery significantly to 52, 55, and 69% respectively.

The presence of perchlorate in the human body can result in improper regulation of metabolism for adults. Furthermore, it also causes developmental and behavioral problems for infants and children because it can interfere with iodide uptake into the thyroid tissue. In this paper, perchlorate in sewage sludge, rice, bottled drinking water and milk was detected for investigating the perchlorate pollution status in China. The places, where the samples were collected, cover most regions of China. Therefore, the final data on perchlorate levels will give an indication of the perchlorate pollution status in China. The final determination of perchlorate was performed by ion chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry with negative mode. The concentration of perchlorate in sewage sludge, rice, bottled drinking water and milk was in the range of 0.56-379.9 microg/kg, 0.16-4.88 mug/kg, 0.037-2.013 microg/L and 0.30-9.1 microg/L, respectively.

The observed recovery rates of beta-lactoglobulin from various samples ranged from 100% for whole milk to just over 50% for a strongly processed yogurt-based baby food product. The influence of processing was investigated in greater detail, showing that an increasing intensity of the applied heat treatment resulted in an increasing loss of beta-lactoglobulin.

To guarantee its safety, the occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in artisanal Palmero cheese smoked with 2 types of vegetable matter (almond shells and dry prickly pear) was studied. The determination of PAH includes extraction and clean-up steps, followed by separation, identification, and quantification of PAH by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in selected ion-monitoring mode. The most abundant PAH are those with 2 and 3 aromatic rings. Although the highest total PAH concentrations corresponded to the cheeses smoked with almond shells, the degree of PAH contamination of the cheeses studied was lower than that found in other cheeses smoked in the traditional way. The nature of the vegetable material used for smoking seemed to have an influence on the type of PAH formed, especially on alkylderivatives and some light PAH. However, despite the artisanal, and consequently variable, production process of these cheeses, many similarities have been found among their PAH profiles. In fact, relatively constant relationships are observed between the concentrations of certain pairs of PAH. Benzo(a)pyrene was only present in 2 samples, and in much lower concentrations than the maximum allowed legal limits.

Detection and identification of the analytes (native compounds, 1-OH pyrene, 3-OH phenanthrene, 3-OH benzo[a]pyrene) were achieved using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Benzo[a]pyrene, phenanthrene, and pyrene were rapidly detected in the plasma stream, whereas 1-OH pyrene and 3-OH phenanthrene appeared later in plasma. These data suggest that pyrene and phenanthrene are progressively metabolized within the organism. Recovery rates of pyrene and phenanthrene in milk over a 24-h period appeared to be very low (0.014 and 0.006%, respectively), whereas the transfer rates of their corresponding metabolites were significantly higher: 0.44% for 1-OH pyrene and 0.073% for 3-OH phenanthrene. Recovery rates in urine were found to be higher (1 to 10 times) than recovery rates in milk. The 1-OH pyrene was found to be the main metabolite in urine as well as in milk. Thus, as has been established for humans, 1-OH pyrene could be considered as a marker of ruminant exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Because 1-OH pyrene and 3-OH phenanthrene were measured in milk (unlike their corresponding native molecules), metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons should be taken into consideration when evaluating the safety of milk. Benzo[a]pyrene and 3-OH benzo[a]pyrene were (less than 0.005%) transferred to milk and urine in very slight amounts.

The most frequently occurring aFAs in food are 12-methyltetradecanoic acid (a15:0) and 14-methylhexadecanoic acid (a17:0), structures where the asymmetric carbon is more than 10 carbons separated from the polar head group. Previously, only enantioseparation of 4-methyl-substituted carboxylic fatty acids has been reported by gas chromatography.

Synthesized (S)-(+)-enantiomers were used to demonstrate that the elution order was (R)- prior to (S)-enantiomers. Using this system, food samples (butter, goat's milk fat, suet, human milk, seal oil, cod liver oil) known to contain aFAs were analyzed. Prior to the enantioselective gas chromatography, unsaturated fatty acids were preseparated by urea complexation, silver ion high performance liquid chromatography (Ag+-HPLC), or both from food samples. The fractions of the food samples enriched with methyl-branched fatty acids were then analyzed by GC/MS in the SIM mode. The measurements confirmed that the (S)-enantiomer of a15:0 (ee >96%), a16:0, and a17:0 (ee >90%, respectively) dominated in all samples.

The amount of soluble nitrogen at pH 4.6 was not significantly different in cheeses obtained by diverse procedures, but it increased during ripening of all samples. This result was coincident with the breakdown of alpha(s1)- and beta-caseins evidenced by electrophoresis, which reached similar extents at late stages of ripening, regardless of the cheese-making process. Multivariate analysis on soluble peptide profiles obtained by liquid chromatography also detected sample grouping according to ripening time, but did not evidence any separation caused by the cheese-making technology.

The tested samples were a CLA oil supplement, and several skim milk dairy products fortified with the supplement (milk, milk powder, fermented milk, yogurt, fresh cheese, and milk-juice blend). The CLA oil supplement was added such that the consumer received 2.4 g/d of CLA by consuming 2 servings. The predominant isomers present, C18:2 cis-9, trans-11 CLA and C18:2 cis-10, trans-12 CLA, were in at a similar ratio, which ranged from 0.97 to 1.05. These major isomers were not significantly affected by processing but a decrease in total CLA in fresh cheese samples was detected after 10 wk of refrigerated storage. Refrigerated storage and thermal treatment resulted in significant decreases or disappearance of some of the minor CLA isomers and a significant increase of trans, trans isomers from both cis, trans, trans, cis, and cis, cis isomers especially in CLA-fortified milk powder but also in fermented milk, yogurt, and milk-juice blend.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D002849', 'D002851', 'D005410', 'D005511', 'D005527', 'D007536', 'D044243', 'D008892', 'D013997']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flame Ionization', 'Food Handling', 'Food, Fortified', 'Isomerism', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk', 'Time Factors']",Hot topic: Fatty acid and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer composition of commercial CLA-fortified dairy products: evaluation after processing and storage.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17430905,2008

We collected breast milk samples from 46 first-time mothers, 2-8 weeks after birth. We also sampled house dust from the homes of a subset of participants by vacuuming commonly used areas. Data on personal characteristics, diet, home furniture, and electrical devices were gathered from each participant using a questionnaire. Breast milk and dust samples were analyzed for PBDEs using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. PBDE concentrations were log-normally distributed in breast milk and dust.

According to the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis data, the molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 32.0 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature of the purified enzyme were 9.0 and 45 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was activated by Cu(2+) (at a concentration of 1.0 mM) and Mn(2+) and inhibited by Hg(2+), Fe(2+), Fe(3+), Zn(2+), and Co(2+). The enzyme was strongly inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, but weakly inhibited by EDTA, 1-10-phenanthroline, and iodoacetic acid. The K(m) and V(max) values of the purified enzyme for casein were 0.25 mg/ml and 0.0286 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively.

17324666,"This review is an update for food and nutrition professionals about single-gene autosomal recessive disorders and Prader-Willi syndrome. These disorders highlight the application of new genetic tools for screening newborns for conditions managed by medical nutrition therapy. Early detection and dietary treatment have been crucial since the 1960s for patients diagnosed with phenylketonuria. The same concept of reducing the dietary substrate that accumulates in disease is applied today for some conditions difficult to diagnose a decade ago. More than 6,000 human single-gene disorders have been identified to date, including more than 100 protein-based metabolic disorders. Tandem mass spectrometry has facilitated newborn screening for more disorders at low cost and high speed. Presently, screening newborns for 29 disorders is recommended in the United States and many states are doubling or tripling the number of tests offered in their screening programs. Complex dietary therapies have evolved for rare disorders, such as fatty acid oxidation, urea cycle, organic acid metabolism, glycogen storage, and energy production. Diagnosis-specific therapy may challenge routine dietary recommendations, such as encouraging fatty and sugary foods or avoiding fruits and milk, and treatment options have spawned a market in special formulas and substitute foods; recommended references and Web sites are provided to assist food and nutrition professionals in navigating this territory.

17171776,"A rapid and simple sample preparation procedure for determining residues of antibiotics of the class of macrolides and lincomycin in whole milk and yoghurt by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is presented. The method is based on the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) technique with hot water as extractant. After dispersing samples of milk and yoghurt on sand, target compounds were eluted from the MSPD column by passing through it 5 mL of water acidified with 30 mmol/L formic acid and heated at 70 degrees C. After pH adjustment and filtration, a volume of 200 microL of the aqueous extract was directly injected into the LC column. MS data acquisition was generally performed in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, selecting two precursor ion to product ion transitions for each target compound. Hot water appeared to be an efficient extracting medium, since absolute recoveries of the analytes in milk and yoghurt were respectively 68-86% and 82-96%. The method proved to be robust as matrix effects, even though present, did not affect significantly the accuracy of the method, as evidenced by analyzing six different batches of both milk and yoghurt. Using roxithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic not used in veterinary medicine) as surrogate internal standard, the accuracy of the method at three different spike levels of the analytes in milk and yoghurt was 86-107% (RSDs not larger than 10%) and 97-117% (RSDs not larger than 13%), respectively. On the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, we estimated this method can quantify a few ppb of the analytes in milk and yoghurt.

Coffee is the main source of CQA in the human diet. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of usual coffee consumption conditions, such as the addition of milk, on CQA bioavailability. Interactions between CQA and milk proteins were shown, using an ultrafiltration technique. These interactions proved to be slightly disrupted during an in vitro digestion process. CQA absorption and bioavailability were then studied in vitro using a Caco-2 cell model coupled with an in vitro digestion process, and in vivo, in a chronic supplementation study in which rats were fed daily coffee or coffee and milk for 3 weeks. Both experiments showed that CQA absorption under its native form is weak, but unmodified by the addition of milk proteins, and slightly reduced by the addition of Maillard reaction products. These data show that there are some interactions between coffee phenolics and milk proteins, but these have no significant effect on CQA bioavailability from coffee in the rat.

Twelve male pigs at 27.1 +/- 0.7 kg BW fitted with jugular venous cannulae were maintained in individual metabolic crates. The animals were each given one of three dietary treatments in random order: blackcurrant powder (BC) to give a dose of 100 mg total ACNs/kg BW mixed either with water and sugar (Diet A), cereal (Weet-Bix), milk, and sugar (Diet B), or cereal, milk, sugar, and an additional flavonol (rutin, approximately 100 mg/kg BW) (Diet C). The four major anthocyanins of BC, delphinidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-rutinoside, were identified and quantified by HPLC-PDA in all three diets. In the pig plasma, four peaks with a reversed pattern to those of anthocyanins in the BC extract were detected. The total amount of anthocyanins absorbed was not significantly different between the three diets, but the rate of absorption and subsequent decline was slower following administration of diet B and C than diet A. All three diets increased antioxidant capacity when measured by the FRAP assay but not when measured by the ORAC and non-protein ORAC assay. However, the increase was delayed and did not appear until 4 h after ingestion, at a time when plasma anthocyanin levels had returned to baseline. The present study demonstrates that the simultaneous intake of food or other flavonoids delays the absorption profile for anthocyanins.

Increased Cd levels in breast milk were found to be significantly associated with frequent cereal consumption and smoking. Smokers had a two-fold higher concentration than did non-smokers (0.15 versus 0.07 microg/l; P = 0.000). In contrast, low Cd levels in breast milk were associated with the intake of supplements containing trace elements or vitamins and trace elements (P < 0.05). This protective effect of supplements on Cd levels was only observed in non-smokers. The Cd levels registered in the present investigation were far below critical levels.

We have developed a novel bio-remediation system based on the symbiosis between leguminous plant and genetically engineered rhizobia. We designed two types of recombinant rhizobia, carrying two genes, synthetic tetrameric metallothionein (MTL4) and cDNA encoding phytochelatin synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPCS). The MTL4 and AtPCS genes were transferred to Mesorhizobium huakuii subsp. rengei B3, which can infect and form nodules on Chinese milk vetch, Astragalus sinicus. The two genes were fused to the nolB or nifH promoter, which generated nodule specific expression of these genes in strain B3. The two recombinant strains, B3(pMPnolBMTL4nifHPCS) and B3::nifHMTL4(pMPnifHPCS), showed 25 and 12-fold increase in Cd concentration, in the free-living cells, respectively. When these recombinant strains established the symbiotic relationship with A. sinicus, the symbionts increased Cd accumulation in nodules by two-fold in hydroponic culture. The expression of the both MTL4 and AtPCS genes showed additive effect on cadmium accumulation in nodules. We also applied these recombinant bacteria to rice paddy soil polluted with Cd (1mgkg(-1) dry weight soil). The accumulation of Cd increased not only in nodules but also in the roots of A. sinicus infected by the recombinant rhizobia. The accumulation of Cd in the plant roots infected by B3(pMPnolBMTL4nifHPCS) achieved three-fold than that by the wild-type B3.

A pilot trial was performed to evaluate the dietary calcium utilization among a sample of Spanish boys on their usual diets, in which the calcium intake and consumption of dairy products were as well examined. Nutrient and food intake was recorded using a 24-h dietary recall and a 2-d food consumption record for 21 subjects aged 11-14 years. Dietary calcium utilization was assessed by means of calcium intake in food and calcium output in faeces and urine as measured by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Overall intake of dairy products was 399.3 +/- 22.1 g/d, and the single most consumed item was milk (72% of the total). An inverse relationship was found between dairy product consumption at breakfast (55% of the total) and BMI (p = 0.016, r = -0.5168). Dairy products contributed the majority of dietary calcium (66.9%). Mean calcium intake was 881.7 +/- 39.9 mg/d, 88% of the recommended value for Spanish adolescents. Net calcium absorption (271.7 +/- 51.7 mg/d) and retention (170.6 +/- 50.9 mg/d) seemed not to be sufficient to meet growth demands during puberty. The results shown that adolescents of the study absorbed 31% of dietary calcium and retained nearly 20% of the total intake, but dietary calcium intake and consumption of dairy products failed to meet recommended values.

These enzymes are produced by different organisms and purified by multi-step procedures. The multi-step purification schemes are cost and time ineffective which can also lead to poor yield, denaturation and loss of enzymatic activity. In our study, extracellular beta-galactosidase from mutant strain Aspergillus oryzaeH26-10-7 was purified by a two step procedure, Metal-ion Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) followed by size-exclusion separation. Purified enzyme was characterized by sodium dodecyl Sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and zymographic analysis. This fungal beta-galactosidase was characterized as a protein corresponding to 113 kDa. Enzyme from mutant strain was found to have five times higher catalytic activity on the synthetic substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) compared to the wild type enzyme.

16813309,"Sunn pest (or cereal bug) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae and Scutelleridae) infestations of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., in the grain filling stage have the potential to adversely affect the quality of harvested grain for bread making. In the absence of resistant wheat cultivars, producers must rely on chemical control to protect their crop from sunn pest infestations. To implement an efficient environment friendly control strategy, there is a need to pinpoint the relationships between the timing of the bug attack and gluten degradation. Recent outbreaks of Eurygaster maura (L.) in northwestern Italy have increased the local concern toward this problem. A 3-yr study was carried out by caging plants of two bread wheat cultivars, characterized by different seed texture and bread-making quality, and introducing adults of E. maura in four periods corresponding to different grain filling stages: heading, early milk-ripe, milk-ripe, and late milk-ripe. The degree of bread-making quality depletion was assessed by analytical and biochemical methods and related to the attack period. Using analysis of variance, significant differences were found in the quality traits of kernels attacked by E. maura in different grain filling stages, the maximum damage occurring with bug feeding at the late milk-ripe stage. Biochemical investigations on gluten confirmed analytical results; in grain samples infested at the late milk-ripe stage, SDS gel electrophoresis revealed the degradation of some components of the high-molecular-weight glutenins, and high-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed a breakdown of the first peak of the insoluble fraction, mainly containing polymeric proteins highly related to dough strength.",Journal of economic entomology,"['D000383', 'D000818', 'D001939', 'D020062', 'D006790', 'D012639', 'D013997', 'D014908']","['Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Bread', 'Heteroptera', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Seeds', 'Time Factors', 'Triticum']",Impact of Eurygaster maura (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae) feeding on quality of bread wheat in relation to attack period.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16813309,2006
16772555,"Terrincho cheese is an uncooked, pressed cheese made from raw whole ovine milk from the ""Churra da Terra Quente"" breed. It requires a minimum ripening time of 30 d. A detailed evaluation of the effect of ripening time on the breakdown of the casein fractions, along with the formation of major breakdown products of casein hydrolysis, was monitored by HPLC to contribute to a more complete characterization of this product. In 30-d-old cheeses, only 20% of alpha(S1)-casein remained intact; the beta-casein fraction was more resistant to hydrolysis. The ripening time of Terrincho cheese can be predicted using 2 variables of normalized peak areas of alpha(S1)-casein and alpha(S1)-I peptide, and a constant; the estimation error is 2.5 d. The pH 4.3-insoluble fraction of Terrincho and cheeses manufactured with bovine milk and with ovine milk combined with 2 levels of bovine milk (10 and 20%) revealed different chromatographic and electrophoretic profiles, especially the alpha(S1)-casein fraction. Similar proteolysis progress was observed, particularly in the percentage of casein fraction degradation. However, using both analytical methods, the detection of 10% bovine milk at 30 d of ripening was no longer possible as result of alpha(S1)-casein hydrolysis. The discriminate analysis applied to HPLC data indicated that at 30 d of ripening, differences between the casein fractions of Terrincho cheese and mixture cheeses were mainly from beta1-casein content. The function thus obtained was able to correctly classify all the samples according to cheese type. Using the descriptive sensory profile, Terrincho cheese at 30 d of ripening could be distinguished from bovine and mixture cheeses owing to its higher fracturability and adhesiveness and lower elasticity and hardness, which correlated with its lower total casein content.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002364', 'D002417', 'D002611', 'D002851', 'D004591', 'D005260', 'D005511', 'D006801', 'D006863', 'D006868', 'D008297', 'D009812', 'D012044', 'D012677', 'D012756', 'D012903', 'D013649', 'D013997', 'D014508']","['Animals', 'Caseins', 'Cattle', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Food Handling', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis', 'Male', 'Odorants', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sensation', 'Sheep', 'Smell', 'Taste', 'Time Factors', 'Urea']",Casein breakdown in terrincho ovine cheese: comparison with bovine cheese and with bovine/ovine cheeses.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16772555,2006

To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed other diagnostic kits based on immunochromatography that should enable more rapid and simple screening for food allergens. Then we examined the performance of these immunochromatographic test kits (IC kits) in terms of sensitivity, repeatability and cross-reactivity to AS proteins in 11 kinds of food models with various heating conditions and physical properties. We also examined processed food models including AS protein of constant concentration, using the IC kits and ELISA kits, and compared the results.

16637674,"Ethyl esters (FAEE) and trideuterium-labeled methyl esters (d3-FAME) of fatty acids were prepared and investigated regarding their suitability as internal standards (IS) for the determination of fatty acids as methyl esters (FAME). On CP-Sil 88, ethyl esters of odd-numbered fatty acids eluted approximately 0.5 min after the respective FAME, and only coelutions with minor FAME were observed. Depending on the problem, one or even many FAEE can be added as IS for the quantification of FAME by both GC-FID and GC-MS. By contrast, d3-FAME coeluted with FAME on the polar GC column, and the use of the former as IS requires application of GC-MS. In the SIM mode, m/z 77 and 90 are suggested for d3-methyl esters of saturated fatty acids, whereas m/z 88 and 101 are recommended for ethyl esters of saturated fatty acids. These m/z values give either no or very low response for FAME and can thus be used for the analysis of FAME in food by GC-MS in the SIM mode. Fatty acids in sunflower oil and mozzarella cheese were quantified using five saturated FAEE as IS. Gravimetric studies showed that the transesterification procedure could be carried out without of loss of fatty acids. GC-EI/MS full scan analysis was suitable for the quantitative determination of all unsaturated fatty acids in both food samples, whereas GC-EI/MS in the SIM mode was particularly valuable for quantifying minor fatty acids. The novel GC-EI/MS/SIM method using fatty acid ethyl esters as internal standards can be used to quantify individual fatty acids only, that is, without determination of all fatty acids (the common 100% method), although this is present.

Reactivation in whey of L. casei cells immobilized on fruit pieces after 7 mo of ripening showed a higher rate of pH decrease and lower final pH value compared with reactivation of samples withdrawn from the remaining mass of the cheese without fruit pieces, from cheese with free L. casei, and rennet cheese. Preliminary sensory evaluation revealed the fruity taste of the cheeses containing immobilized L. casei cells on fruit pieces. Commercial Feta cheese was characterized by a more sour taste, whereas no significant differences concerning cheese flavor were reported by the panel between cheese containing free L. casei and rennet cheese. Salted cheeses scored similar values to commercial Feta cheese, whereas unsalted cheese scores were significantly lower, but still acceptable to the sensory panelists.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D018914', 'D002611', 'D055598', 'D002627', 'D002851', 'D012085', 'D000431', 'D005285', 'D005511', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D006863', 'D019344', 'D007780', 'D007785', 'D008892', 'D019936', 'D012677', 'D013649']","['Animals', 'Cells, Immobilized', 'Cheese', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chymosin', 'Ethanol', 'Fermentation', 'Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lactobacillus casei', 'Lactose', 'Milk', 'Probiotics', 'Sensation', 'Taste']",Probiotic cheese production using Lactobacillus casei cells immobilized on fruit pieces.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000382', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'microbiology', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16606715,2006

This paper reports the development of a chromatographic method for routine analysis enabling the detection of the addition of soybean proteins to dairy products. A perfusion chromatography column and a linear binary gradient of acetonitrile-water-0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a temperature of 60 degrees C were used. A very simple sample treatment consisting of mixing the sample with a suitable solvent (Milli-Q water or bicarbonate buffer (pH=11)) and centrifuging was used. The method enabled the separation of soybean proteins from milk proteins in less than 4 min (at a flow-rate of 3 ml/min). The method has been successfully applied to the detection of soybean proteins in milk, cheese, yogurt, and enteral formula. The correct quantitation of these vegetable proteins has also been possible in milk adulterated at origin with known sources of soybean proteins.

One such technique is the practice of using commercially available atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources with the corona discharge turned off, a process termed no-discharge APCI (ND-APCI). The relative LC/MS responses for several different classes of veterinary drugs were obtained by using ND-APCI, electrospray ionization (ESI), and APCI. While the ND-APCI-MS and -MSn spectra for these compounds were comparable with ESI, ND-APCI provided advantages in sensitivity and selectivity for some compounds. Drugs that were charged in solution as cations or sodium adducts responded particularly well with this technique. Instrumental parameters such as temperatures, gas and liquid flow rates, and source design were investigated to determine their effect on the process of ND-APCI.

The limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 250 ng/L for AFM(1). All the positive milk samples for AFM(1) were confirmed by LC-MS. AFM(1) was detected in 81% of milk samples, ranging from 2 to 108 ng/L. Three samples were over the legal limits (50 ng/L). Mean contamination of samples obtained from stabulated ewes was higher than that from grazing ewes (35.27 vs. 12.47 ng/L). Furthermore, samples collected in the period September-October showed higher contamination than samples collected during the other months (42.68 vs. 10.55 ng/L). Both differences are related to the administration of compound feed. Based on current toxicological knowledge we concluded that the AFM(1) contamination levels recorded in ewe milk did not present a serious human health hazard.

Each lot of the 2 types of cheeses was subdivided into 4 equal portions, and one subsample of each cheese was immediately stored at 4 degrees C as the NFC for 0, 14, and 28 d. The other 3 were immediately frozen (-20 degrees C) for 0, 3, and 6 mo (0MF, 3MF, and 6MF) and subsequently thawed the next day at 4 degrees C.

The PS had no pyruvic acid, and MJ contained no isotartaric acid; however, several unknown large peaks appeared between propionic and butyric acids. Differences in organic acid contents between PS and MJ cheeses were significant for all acids except citric and lactic acid. Lot effect was significant for most of the known acids, indicating that variations existed in milk composition and manufacturing parameters.

16428640,"Based on the potential benefits of cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) for human health, there is a need to develop effective strategies for enhancing milk fat CLA concentrations. Levels of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk can be increased by supplements of fish oil (FO) and sunflower oil (SO), but there is considerable variation in the response. Part of this variance may reflect time-dependent ruminal adaptations to high levels of lipid in the diet, which lead to alterations in the formation of specific biohydrogenation intermediates. To test this hypothesis, 16 late lactation Holstein-British Friesian cows were used in a repeated measures randomized block design to examine milk fatty acid composition responses to FO and SO in the diet over a 28-d period. Cows were allocated at random to corn silage-based rations (8 per treatment) containing 0 (control) or 45 g of oil supplement/kg of dry matter consisting (1:2; wt/wt) of FO and SO (FSO), and milk composition was determined on alternate days from d 1. Compared with the control, the FSO diet decreased mean dry matter intake (21.1 vs. 17.9 kg/d), milk fat (47.7 vs. 32.6 g/kg), and protein content (36.1 vs. 33.3 g/kg), but had no effect on milk yield (27.1 vs. 26.4 kg/d). Reductions in milk fat content relative to the FSO diet were associated with increases in milk trans-10 18:1, trans-10, cis-12 CLA, and trans-9, cis-11 CLA concentrations (r(2) = 0.74, 0.57, and 0.80, respectively). Compared with the control, the FSO diet reduced milk 4:0 to 18:0 and cis 18:1 content and increased trans 18:1, trans 18:2, cis-9, trans-11 CLA, 20:5 n-3, and 22:6 n-3 concentrations. The FSO diet caused a rapid elevation in milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, reaching a maximum of 5.37 g/100 g of fatty acids on d 5, but these increases were transient, declining to 2.35 g/100 g of fatty acids by d 15. They remained relatively constant thereafter. Even though concentrations of trans-11 18:1 followed the same pattern of temporal changes as cis-9, trans-11 CLA, the total trans 18:1 content of FSO milk was unchanged because of the concomitant increases in the concentration of other isomers (Delta(4-10) and Delta(12-15)), predominantely trans-10 18:1. In conclusion, supplementing diets with FSO enhances milk fat cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, but the high level of enrichment declines because of changes in ruminal biohydrogenation that result in trans-10 replacing trans-11 as the major 18:1 biohydrogenation intermediate formed in the rumen.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000824', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D004032', 'D005223', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D005395', 'D008401', 'D006865', 'D044243', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D010938', 'D012417', 'D012820', 'D000074242', 'D003313']","['Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Diet', 'Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Fish Oils', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrogenation', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Plant Oils', 'Rumen', 'Silage', 'Sunflower Oil', 'Zea mays']",Examination of the persistency of milk fatty acid composition responses to fish oil and sunflower oil in the diet of dairy cows.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000008', 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428640,2006
16395734,"Electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI-ITMS) coupled to a two-dimensional liquid chromatographic separation was applied to the identification of peptides in antimicrobial fractions of the aqueous extracts of nine Italian cheese varieties. In particular, the chromatographic fractions collected during a preliminary fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) separation on the cheese extracts were assayed for antimicrobial activity towards Lactobacillus sakei A15. Active fractions were subsequently analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization sequential mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI)-ITMSn, with n up to 3. Peptide identification was then performed starting from a conventional proteomics approach based on tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis followed by database searching. In many cases this strategy had to be integrated by a careful correlation between spectral information and predicted peptide fragmentation, in order to reach unambiguous identifications. When even this integrated approach failed, MS3 measurements provided decisive information on the amino acid sequence of some peptides, through fragmentation of pendant groups along the peptide chain. As a result, 45 peptides, all arising from hydrolysis of milk caseins, were identified in nine antimicrobial FPLC fractions of aqueous extracts obtained from five of the nine cheese varieties considered.

16390209,"The aim of this study was to determine the transfer kinetics of soil-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to milk in lactating cows. Soil (500 g/day) fortified with fluorene (104 microg/g dry soil), phenanthrene (82 microg/g), pyrene (78 microg/g), and benzo[a]pyrene (33 microg/g) was administered to three dairy cows via a rumen cannulas for 28 consecutive days. Parent compounds and their major metabolites in milk were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Secretion of parent compounds in milk did not increase significantly (P > 0.05) over the control values measured before supply. Target monohydroxylated metabolites were not detected in control samples, but 2-hydroxy fluorene, 3-hydroxy phenanthrene, and 1-hydroxy pyrene were present in milk by the second day of dosing. The highest concentrations of metabolites in milk (31-39 ng/mL) were for 1-hydroxy pyrene at days 7 and 14 of dosing. The observed plateaus for 3-hydroxy phenanthrene and 2-hydroxy fluorene were lower (respectively, 0.69 and 2.79 ng/mL) but significantly increased in comparison to the control samples. Contrarily, 3-hydroxy benzo[a]pyrene was not detected in milk at any sampling time. These results suggested a notable metabolism of the parent compounds after their extraction from soil during the digestive transfer. Thus, the metabolization of fluorene and pyrene can lead to higher concentrations of metabolites than of parent compounds in milk.

16357266,"The aim of this study was to provide the biochemical and structural characterization of Piacentinu Ennese cheese and to evaluate the impact of different farm technologies on cheese proteolysis and microstructure. Fifteen cheeses were manufactured according to traditional technology, i.e., from raw milk and farmhouse rennet in the absence of starter culture. Pasteurized milk, commercial rennet, and starter were used for production of 20 nontraditional cheeses. Proteolysis in Piacentinu Ennese cheese was monitored during a 2- to 10-mo ripening time. Low rates of overall proteolysis were observed in cheese, as percentages of total N soluble at pH 4.6 and in 12% trichloroacetic acid were about 11.40 and 8.10%, respectively, after 10 mo of age. Patterns of primary proteolysis by urea-PAGE showed that alpha(s)-caseins were degraded to a larger extent than were beta-caseins, although a considerable amount of both caseins was still intact after 10 mo. Reversed phase-HPLC analysis of the cheese peptide fractions showed a slow decrease in the levels of hydrophobic peptides coupled to increasing levels of hydrophilic compounds as the cheese aged. The structural characteristics of Piacentinu Ennese cheese were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy after 2, 4, and 6 mo of age. The micrographs showed a sponge-like structural network with a well-distributed system of empty spaces, originally occupied by whey and fat. The microstructure changed during cheese ripening to become more compact with cavities of smaller size. Farm technology significantly affected cheese proteolysis and microstructure. Nontraditional cheeses had higher levels of pH 4.6-soluble N and showed a larger hydrolysis of alpha(s)-casein fractions by urea-PAGE analysis than did traditional cheeses. Large differences between cheese-types also concerned the patterns of secondary proteolysis. Nontraditional cheeses had higher levels of 12% trichloroacetic acid-soluble N and showed larger proportions of free amino acids and hydrophilic peptides in the HPLC profiles of the corresponding 70% ethanol-soluble N fraction than traditional cheeses. Nontraditional cheeses also had a more open structure with a coarser and less continuous appearance than did traditional cheeses.

In addition to hair loss, female HHRs show involution of the mammary gland at an early stage of lactation. In the present study we investigated the mammary gland development in HHR. Morphological examinations revealed that HHR mammary glands are underdeveloped in virgins and exhibit distended alveoli on day 1 of lactation (L1), followed by involution. Milk secretion was observed on L1 in HHR. Whey acidic protein and other proteins were increased in milk of HHR and heterozygous rats on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay revealed apoptosis induction in HHRs at an early stage of lactation. By Western blotting, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5A levels in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of the mammary glands were not different between HHR and SDR on L1 and L7. Nuclear localization of STAT5A in HHR and SDR was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Tyr-phosphorylated STAT5A was not detected in HHR but was detected in SDR nuclear fractions. Several proteins modified with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) were detected in HHR nuclear extract on L1, although not in SDR or heterozygous rats by Western blotting. When HHR nuclear extract was applied to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, a part of STAT5A was recovered in bound fractions. STAT5A of SDR or heterozygous rat nuclei were not bound to the lectin. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that STAT5A modified with O-GlcNAc is bound to the STAT5-responsive element. These results indicate that the mammary glands of HHR showed terminal differentiation for a short period, followed immediately by involution.

It involves extraction of the residues from the biological tissues/fluids by acidic aqueous solution, centrifugation and filtration prior to injection on a C18 narrow-bore column, and detection through a 3-step-mode fluorescence detector.

For quantitation of CoQ10 in food samples, 2 liquid chromatography (LC) methods with UV and mass spectrometry (MS) detections were developed. LC with UV detection was performed at 25 degrees C on a Hyperclone ODS 5 microm 150 x 4.6 mm column with mobile phase consisting of methanol-ethanol-2-propanol (70 + 15 + 15, v/v/v). Flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Retention time of CoQ10 was 10.9 +/- 0.1 min. The method was sensitive [limit of detection (LOD) = 0.2 mg/kg], reproducible [relative standard deviation (RSD) = 3:0%), and linear up to 25 mg/kg (R > 0.999). LC/MS analysis was performed on a LUNA C18 3 microm, 150 x 4.6 mm column, using mobile phase consisting of ethanol-dioxane-acetic acid (9 + 1 + 0.01, v/v/v), flow rate was 0.6 mL/min, and the retention time of CoQ10 was 4.1 +/- 0.1 min. Identification and quantitation were performed with a Finnigan-LCQ mass detector in positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode. Mass spectra were obtained in selected-ion monitoring mode; molecular mass (M+H)+ m/z 863.4 +/- 1 was used for quantitative determination. MS detection is more sensitive than UV detection (LOD = 0.1 mg/kg), less reproducible (RSD = 4.0%), and linear in selected range. Analytical recoveries are 75-90% and depend on the ratio between the amount of fat in the matrix and the concentration of CoQ10 in the sample.

16099524,"Lactobacillus helveticus strains, one of the most nutritionally fastidious lactic acid bacteria, have a potent proteolytic system that makes them very interesting for different uses in the dairy industry. Its applications concern from cheese ripening to the preparation of fermented milk products with biologically active peptides. The cell-free extract (CFE) of Lactobacillus helveticus strain ITG LH1 was analysed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), using IPG immobiline dry strips (pH 4-7). With the aim to study the proteolytic enzymes expressed by Lactobacillus helveticus ITG LH1 grown in milk medium, a two step-chromatography methodology, based on ion exchange and affinity chromatography, was developed for the preparation of a peptidase-rich sub-proteome from the CFE of stationary growing cells. Several affinity chromatography columns were tested and among them a HiTrap Chelating column was selected as it provided the best performance for the enrichment in peptidases. Peptidase activities were studied using different beta-Naphtylamide (beta-NA) derivatives and specific activities were increased 50- to 100-fold by this chromatographic procedure. Sub-proteome characterisation was performed by 2D-PAGE, pH 4-7, followed by protein digestion with trypsin, analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and subsequent database searches using peptide mass fingerprints. Among the most abundant proteins seven peptidases were present, namely the two general aminopeptidases (PepN, PepC), three dipeptidases (PepDA, PepV, PepQ) and two endopeptidases (PepO, PepO3), all of them corresponding to the catalytic classes of metallo- or cysteine-peptidases.

16038017,"During industrial treatments, milk proteins could be oxidatively modified, thus leading to the formation of modified/oxidised amino acid residues. The apparition of such modified residues may contribute to the formation of new immunologically reactive structures. Some of these adducts could, in an advanced stage, lead to cross-linked protein species whose proteolytic susceptibility would be drastically decreased. Such protein species, that are resistant to digestion, could also constitute major food allergens. Therefore, these oxidative protein modifications tend to increase the natural allergenicity of milk proteins. For these reasons, monitoring milk protein oxidative modifications could be very useful regarding both product quality and allergenicity issues. In the present paper, we highlight, using different analytical approaches, the preferential carbonylation of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) during industrial treatments of milk.

15945118,"Food and beverages contain protein glycation adducts--both early-stage adducts and advanced glycation endproducts. We determined the concentrations of glycation adducts in selected food and beverages by liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometric detection. Cola drink contained low concentrations of glycation free adducts, whereas pasteurised and sterilised milk were rich sources of heat-stable glycation adduct residues--Nepsilon-carboxymethyl-lysine and Nepsilon-carboxyethyl-lysine. Laboratory rodent food was a rich source of advanced glycation endproducts. Measurement of glycation adducts in 24 h urine samples of normal and diabetic rats indicated that < 10% of glycation adduct residue consumption was excreted. Induction of diabetes by streptozotocin led to a 2-fold increase in urinary excretion of Nepsilon-carboxymethyl-lysine and a 27-fold increase in urinary excretion of methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone Ndelta-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-ornithine - the latter was decreased by high-dose thiamine therapy that also prevented the development of nephropathy. We conclude that cola drinks are a poor source of glycation adduct whereas thermally processed milk is rich in glycation adducts. Dietary glycation adducts residues probably have low bioavailability. Experimental diabetes is associated with a marked increase in exposure to endogenous formation of methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone which is linked to the development of diabetic nephropathy.",Molecular nutrition & food research,"['D000818', 'D001628', 'D002853', 'D003921', 'D004032', 'D005243', 'D005504', 'D017127', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D051381', 'D017207']","['Animals', 'Beverages', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Diet', 'Feces', 'Food Analysis', 'Glycation End Products, Advanced', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",Assay of advanced glycation endproducts in selected beverages and food by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000652', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'urine', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15945118,2005

The presence of a micellar system avoids the previous steps of solvent extraction and reduces the cost, toxicity while enhancing the sensitivity, selectivity and the molar absorptivity. The reaction is instantaneous and the absorbance remains stable for over 24 h. The average molar absorption coefficient and Sandell's sensitivity were found to be 5.02 x 10(4) L mol(-1) cm(-1) and 10 ng cm(-2) of Hg, respectively. Linear calibration graphs were obtained for 0.05 - 10 mg L(-1) of Hg; the stoichiometric composition of the chelate is 1:2 (Hg:dithizone). The method is characterized by a detection limit of 1 microg L(-1) of Hg. Large excesses of over 60 cations, anions and complexing agents (e.g. EDTA, tartrate, oxalate, citrate, phosphate, thiourea, azide, SCN-) do not interfere in the determination. The method was successfully applied to a number of environmental water samples (potable and polluted), biological samples (human blood and urine; milk and fish) and soils; solutions contained both mercury(I) and mercury(II) as well as complex synthetic mixtures.

One method, dubbed the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method for pesticide residue analysis, entailed extraction of 15 g sample with 15 mL acetonitrile (MeCN) containing 1% acetic acid followed by addition of 6 g anhydrous magnesium sulfate and 1.5 g sodium acetate. After centrifugation, 1 mL of the buffered MeCN extract underwent a cleanup step (in a technique known as dispersive solid-phase extraction) using 50 mg each of C18 and primary secondary amine sorbents plus 150 mg MgSO4. The second method incorporated a form of matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD), in which 0.5 g sample plus 2 g C18 and 2 g anhydrous sodium sulfate was mixed in a mortar and pestle and added above a 2 g Florisil column on a vacuum manifold. Then, 5 x 2 mL MeCN was used to elute the pesticide analytes from the sample into a collection tube, and the extract was concentrated to 0.5 mL by evaporation. Extracts in both methods were analyzed concurrently by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The recoveries of semi-polar and polar pesticides were typically 100% in both methods (except that basic pesticides, such as thiabendazole and imazalil, were not recovered in the MSPD method), but recovery of nonpolar pesticides decreased as fat content of the sample increased.

To assess the occurrence and distribution of these compounds and to estimate the exposure levels based on the detected amounts, numerous samples of foodstuffs and cigarette smoke were analysed by solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence. The levels found of beta-carbolines were highly variable. Low processed foodstuffs (i.e. milk, yoghurt, uncooked meats and fish) did not contain norharman and harman above the detection limit. Others, however, contained relatively high concentrations (at the tens of ng g(-1) or microg l(-1) level) depending on the processing conditions as, for example, 'well-done' cooked meat and fish. The highest amounts of norharman and harman were found in brewed coffee (29-207 microg l(-1)), sauces (soy sauce and Tabasco, among others; 4-252 microg l(-1)), 'well done' cooked meat and fish (57-160 ng g(-1)), toasted bread (42-160 ng g(-1)), and fermented alcoholic beverages (n.d.-41 mug l(-1)). beta-Carbolines also occurred in a high amount in the mainstream of cigarette smoke (207-2780 ng/cigarette), which is an important contributor to daily exposure to these compounds. Based on these results, it is concluded that the daily exposure to beta-carbolines in humans might be from tens to hundreds of micrograms, with cigarette smoke, coffee, certain seasonings, cooked foods and alcoholic beverages, in this order, being the major contributors.

15754824,"Three commercially available chiral capillary columns, Chirasil-Dex, BGB-176SE, and BGB-172, have been evaluated for the separation into enantiomers of the 19 chiral polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) congeners stable at room temperature. The enantiomers of 15 chiral PCBs were, at least to some extent, separated using these beta-cyclodextrin based columns. Multidimensional techniques, such as heart-cut multi-dimensional gas chromatography (heart-cut MDGC) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC), were investigated for their ability to solve coelution problems with other PCBs present in commercial mixtures and real-life samples. Heart-cut MDGC improved the separation as compared to one-dimensional GC, and enantiomeric fractions of the investigated chiral PCBs could be determined free from interferences. However, limitations on the number of target compounds that can be transferred to the second column in a single run and, therefore, the time consumption, have led to the evaluation of GC x GC as an alternative for this type of analysis. With GC x GC, two column set-ups were tested, both having a chiral column as first-dimension column, and two different polar stationary phase columns in the second dimension. On using both column combinations, congeners 84, 91, 95, 132, 135, 136, 149, 174, and 176 could be determined free from coelutions with other PCBs.

In several studies we have investigated the influence of dietary, biochemical, and genetic factors on vitamin E biokinetics. In these studies, subjects ingested a capsule containing 150 mg deuterated RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, blood was taken up to 48 hr, and tocopherols were analyzed by liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. There was significantly greater plasma-labeled alpha-tocopherol concentrations when the capsule was consumed with a high-fat meal (17.5 g) versus a low-fat meal (2.7 g), and there was also a difference between a high-fat toast and butter and a cereal with full-fat milk meal (both 17.5 g fat), indicating that both the amount of fat and food matrix is important for vitamin E absorption. Dyslipidemic subjects displayed a reduced plasma uptake of newly absorbed alpha-tocopherol, and differences were also apparent in individual lipoproteins. A decreased uptake of labeled alpha-tocopherol was also observed in erythrocytes, platelets, and lymphocytes of dyslipidemics. Following vitamin E supplementation (400 mg/day, 4 weeks), the uptake of newly absorbed alpha-tocopherol was decreased, presumably because of saturation of alpha-tocopherol transfer protein. We also found that apoE3 subjects displayed a considerably reduced uptake of newly absorbed labeled alpha-tocopherol compared to apoE4 subjects, which may be a consequence of the reduced low-density lipoprotein catabolic rate in these subjects. Taken together, these data show that several physiological factors influence the uptake of newly absorbed alpha-tocopherol, and that this is an important consideration in the design of future vitamin E supplementation studies.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,"['D001057', 'D001682', 'D003903', 'D004041', 'D019587', 'D014644', 'D006801', 'D008055', 'D024505', 'D014810', 'D024502']","['Apolipoproteins E', 'Biological Availability', 'Deuterium', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Lipids', 'Tocopherols', 'Vitamin E', 'alpha-Tocopherol']",Physiological factors influencing vitamin E biokinetics.,"['Q000235', None, None, 'Q000008', None, None, None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000493', 'Q000008']","['genetics', None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, 'blood', None, 'pharmacokinetics', 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15753134,2005

Terrincho is a traditional Portuguese cheese manufactured from raw ewe's milk. The main groups of microorganisms (lactococci, lactobacilli, enterococci, pseudomonads, staphylococci, coliforms, yeasts, and molds) were determined following conventional microbiological procedures. Free amino acids and biogenic amines were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, following extraction from the cheese matrix and derivatization with dabsyl chloride. The total content of free amino acids ranged from 1,730 mg/kg of dry matter at the beginning of the ripening stage to 5,180 mg/kg of dry matter by day 60 of ripening; such an increase was highly correlated with the increase of water-soluble nitrogen in total nitrogen, 12% trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen in total nitrogen, and 5% phosphotungstic acid-soluble nitrogen in total nitrogen throughout ripening. Histamine was consistently present at very low levels, whereas putrescine, cadaverine, and tryptamine were the dominant biogenic amines and increased in concentration during ripening.

This research effort focused on a search for the molecules responsible for those organoleptic characteristics. Eighty cheeses manufactured in 4 dairies located in the Appelation d'Origine Protegee region of Serra da Estrela, Portugal, were thus assayed for volatiles, in an attempt to characterize their odorous profile. Cheeses were analyzed from the time of manufacture up to 180 d of ripening. The volatile fraction was assayed by solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, and several compounds belonging to different chemical groups (e.g., fatty acids, esters, carbonyl compounds, pyrazines, and sulfur compounds) were detected in that traditional cheese. Among these, free fatty acids (FFA) were quantitatively the dominant family present. Furthermore, sensory descriptors for the typical aroma of this cheese included acidic, sweaty, and sheepy-like. Acetic, isobutyric, and isovaleric acids increased in concentration during the ripening process up to 90 d, and remained constant thereafter. Preliminary sensory analysis was performed by addition of the major FFA to an unripened cheese matrix; results showed that they could successfully be used as ripening indicators for this cheese.

To date, most of the reported B-cell epitope mapping were performed on polyethylene pins or cellulose-derivative membrane. We sought to locate the motifs critical for human-specific IgE and rabbit polyclonal IgG binding using extensively purified CAS1_BOVIN, synthetic peptides and derivatives. Thirteen overlapping peptides covering the whole CAS1_BOVIN encompassing 17 : 20 amino acid (AA) were synthesized by f-moc AA solid-phase polyamide peptide synthesis. In addition, six cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage fragments were prepared. Limited hydrolysis, oxidized and reduced/alkylated derivatives were also produced. The preparations were purified by ion exchange, gel filtration chromatography, reversed phase and high-performance liquid chromatography. The homogeneity was visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and poly acryl amide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by IgE and IgG immunoblotting. IgE binding was measured by Biotin Streptavidin (Bio/strep) fluoro enzyme immuno assay (FEIA) or ELISA-inhibition. Eighteen CM allergy (CMA) sera from 45 clinically examined children (Melbourne) and five adults (Bergen) were selected. Individual sera and pools were used for mapping IgE-binding epitopes. Rabbit IgG sera and pools were used for locating the antigenic sites of the molecule. Results indicated that all the individual CMA sera and pools recognized the intact molecule and three of the CNBr fragments as major antibody-binding allergens.

Experimental Camembert-type cheeses were prepared in duplicate from pasteurized milk inoculated with Kluyveromyces lactis, Geotrichum candidum, Penicillium camemberti and Brevibacterium linens under aseptic conditions. Two replicates performed under controlled conditions of temperature (12 degrees C), relative humidity (95 +/- 2%), and atmosphere showed similar ripening characteristics. The evolutions of metabolite concentrations were studied during ripening. The volatile components were extracted by dynamic headspace extraction, separated and quantified by gas chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. For each cheese the volatile concentrations varied with the part considered (rind or core). Except for ethyl acetate and 2-pentanone, the volatile quantities observed were higher than their perception thresholds. The flavour component production was best correlated with the starter strains. During the first 10 days the ester formations (ethyl, butyl and isoamyl acetates) were associated with the concentrations of K. lactis and G. candidum. The rind quantity of esters was lower than that observed in core probably due to (1) a diffusion from the core to the surface and (2) evaporation from the surface to the chamber atmosphere. G. candidum and Brev. linens association produced 3 methyl butanol and methyl 3-butanal from leucine, respectively. DMDS came from the methionine catabolism due to Brev. linens. Styrene production was attributed to Pen. camemberti. 2-Pentanone evolution was associated with Pen. camemberti spores and G. candidum. 2-Heptanone changes were not directly related to flora activities while 2-octanone production was essentially due to G. candidum.

The purification procedure was based on an aqueous extract of hygienized rennet paste (HRP), which was chromatographed on DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow then adsorbed on phenyl superose followed by a re-chromatography on the same column. The final enzymatic preparation, where the overall activity recovery was 3%, showed a molecular mass of 53 kDa. The highest activity was determined on p-nitrophenyl butyrate, but marked hydrolysis was also detected on beta-naphthyl caprylate. In contrast, low activity on tributyrin (substrate under emulsion form) was detected, thus confirming the esterase character of purified enzyme.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D012085', 'D005511', 'D006041', 'D006863', 'D008049', 'D013270', 'D013379', 'D013696']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Chymosin', 'Food Handling', 'Goats', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lipase', 'Stomach', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Temperature']",Purification and characterization of a pregastric esterase from a hygienized kid rennet paste.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000201', None, None]","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'enzymology', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15290959,2004
15259219,"In cheese, the concentration and form of residual Ca greatly influences texture. Two methods were used to determine the proportions of soluble (SOL) and insoluble (INSOL) Ca in Cheddar cheese during 4 mo of ripening. The first method was based on the acid-base buffering curves of cheese and the second was based on the extraction of the aqueous phase (""juice"") of cheese under high pressure and determining the concentration of SOL Ca in the juice using atomic absorption spectroscopy. When cheese was acidified there was a strong buffering peak at pH approximately 4.8, which was due to the solubilization of residual colloidal calcium phosphate (CCP) of milk that remained in cheese as INSOL Ca phosphate. The area of this buffering peak in cheese was expressed as a percentage of the original area of this peak in milk and was used to estimate the concentration of residual INSOL Ca phosphate in cheese. There were no significant differences between the 2 methods. The proportions of INSOL Ca in cheese decreased from approximately 73 to approximately 58% between d 1 and 4 mo.

Nevertheless, typical hydrolysis products derived from rennet action on alpha(s1)-casein have been detected during the ripening of hard cheeses. The aim of the present work was to investigate the influence of residual milk-clotting enzyme on alpha(s1)-casein hydrolysis in Reggianito cheeses. For that purpose, we studied the influence of cooking temperature (45, 52, and 60 degrees C) on milk-clotting enzyme residual activity and alpha(s1)-casein hydrolysis during ripening. Milk-clotting enzyme residual activity in cheeses was assessed using a chromatographic method, and the hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-casein was determined by electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography. Milk-clotting enzyme activity was very low or undetectable in 60 degrees C- and 52 degrees C-cooked cheeses at the beginning of the ripening, but it increased afterwards, particularly in 52 degrees C-cooked cheeses. Cheese curds that were cooked at 45 degrees C had higher initial milk clotting activity, but also in this case, there was a later increase. Hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-casein was detected early in cheeses made at 45 degrees C, and later in those made at higher temperatures. The peptide alpha(s1)-I was not detected in 60 degrees C-cooked cheeses. The results suggest that residual milk-clotting enzyme can contribute to proteolysis during ripening of hard cheeses, because it probably renatures partially after the cooking step. Consequently, the production of peptides derived from alpha(s1)-casein in hard cheeses may be at least, partially due to this proteolytic agent.",Journal of dairy science,"['D016282', 'D002364', 'D002611', 'D002851', 'D004591', 'D005524', 'D006358', 'D006868', 'D010446', 'D013997']","['Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases', 'Caseins', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Food Technology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrolysis', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Time Factors']",Influence of residual milk-clotting enzyme on alpha(s1) casein hydrolysis during ripening of Reggianito Argentino cheese.,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None]","['metabolism', 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15202640,2004
15193805,"During the ripening of Emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. In Emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters like Lactobacillus helveticus, Lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as Propionibacterium freudenreichii. The aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a reference map. A methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of cheese matrix prior to 2D-PAGE analysis. The aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. Five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) DNA and RNA repair and (v) oxidoreduction. The results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and Propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. Information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening.

To date, it has been difficult to determine whether these compounds are natural products or derived from industrial synthesis. Molecular-level 14C analysis of these compounds is particularly appealing because most industrial compounds are manufactured from petrochemicals (14C-free) and natural compounds should have ""modern"" or ""contemporary"" 14C levels.

Processed infant food products such as rice-based cereals, mixed rice/formula cereals, milk-based infant formula, applesauce and puree of peaches, pears, carrots, sweet potatoes, green beans, and squash were evaluated for total and speciated arsenic content. Arsenic concentrations found in rice-based cereals (63-320 ng/g dry weight) were similar to those reported for raw rice. Results for the analysis of powdered infant formula by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) indicated a narrow and low arsenic concentration range (12 to 17 ng/g). Arsenic content in puree infant food products, including rice cereals, fruits, and vegetables, varies from <1 to 24 ng/g wet weight. Sample treatment with trifluoroacetic acid at 100 degrees C were an efficient and mild method for extraction of arsenic species present in different food matrixes as compared to alternative methods that included sonication and accelerated solvent extraction. Extraction recoveries from 94 to 128% were obtained when the summation of species was compared to total arsenic.

Twelve farms were selected and grouped according the type of forage in the ration: hay-based diets (four farms); hay and corn silage-based diets (four farms); and diets based on hay, corn silage and grass silages (four farms). For cheesemaking, 1000 kg of milk collected from two consecutive milkings was sampled from each farm and processed in the same cheese factory. Cheeses were ripened in the same cellar, in controlled humidity (78-85% relative humidity) and temperature (9-12 degrees C), until analysis. After 68 (62-74), 200 (194-206) and 360 (354-366) d of ripening, a cheese from each batch was analysed for moisture, protein and fat, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and volatile compounds. These latter were analysed by dynamic reverse carrier gas headspace gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique, scanning from m/z 29 to m/z 300 at 0.5 s cycle time. Total and individual VFA contents of cheeses did not differ between the different dietary treatments and increased linearly (P<0.01) during ripening, indicating that there were no appreciable defects of fermentation. Sixty-two volatile compounds were identified in the cheese samples: 12 aldehydes, 9 ketones, 16 alcohols, 17 esters, 2 hydrocarbons, 4 sulphur-containing compounds and 2 terpenes.

The concentration of the H2B1a component of IVM was analysed in these dairy products using an HPLC method with fluorescence detection. The mean recovery of the method was, depending on the matrix, between 87 and 100%. Limits of detection in the order of only 0.1 microg H2B1a/kg of product were achieved. Maximum concentrations of IVM were detected mostly at 2 d after drug administration to the ewes. The highest concentration of IVM was found on day 2 in 60-day ripened cheese (96 microg H2B1a/kg cheese). Secondary whey was the matrix with the lowest concentration of IVM (<0.6 microg H2B1a/ kg). Residue levels fell below the limits of detection between day 5 (for secondary whey) and day 25 (for all cheese samples). In the matrices investigated, linear correlations between daily concentrations of IVM, milk fat and solid content were evident. During yoghurt production, fermentation and thermal stability of IVM was observed. During cheese production, approximately 35% of the IVM, present in the raw (bulk) milk samples, was lost. From the results it was concluded that the processing of ewes' milk did not eliminate the drug residues under investigation. The consequences of IVM in the human diet were discussed.

Beverages containing whey protein isolate were clear at pH 2-7 before heating, but only beverages at pH <or= 3.0 were clear after thermal processing (88 degrees C, 120 s). Beverages at higher pH were made clear after heating by addition of food-grade lauryl sulfate, which prevented aggregation of the denatured proteins formed during thermal processing.

In raw milk, the mineral content shows a certain degree of variability, in addition to the variability introduced by the different processing conditions, in order to meet the requirements prescribed by trade regulations and to produce dairy products. In all cases, skimming increases the concentration of mineral nutrients, which is especially remarkable in Ca contained in skimmed milk powder. In yogurt, added milk solids like dried milk or evaporated milk appreciably increase the mineral content, even more so if ultrafiltrates are used.

14679316,"Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is one of the most commonly consumed drugs in our daily life, and its use is increasing. However, very little attention has been paid to its potential effects on early growth and development. Because of the steady increase in breast feeding of infants and because caffeine diffuses readily into breast milk, the present study examined if caffeine intake by newborn rats during lactation would affect the saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the growing cerebellum. A total of 10 timed pregnant rats were purchased from the breeder. At birth litters were combined, and 8 pups were randomly assigned to each dam without regard to the sex of the pups. Dams with litters were divided into 2 groups. Dams of group 1 received a 20% protein diet as a control, and dams of group 2 received a 20% protein diet plus caffeine (4 mg/100 g BW). Pups were killed at day 10. The cerebellums were removed, weighed and homogenized. Gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantify free fatty acids. Chronic caffeine exposure from birth to day 10 in pups through the maternal milk resulted in a decrease in cerebellum weight, a significant increase in the saturated fatty acids, and a tendency toward an increase of monounsaturated fatty acids. In addition, there was a slight increase of some of the polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, there was no difference in food intake of the lactating dams and weight gain of the pups between the groups. These data indicate that early caffeine intake by the suckling pups alters the composition of fatty acids of the cerebellum; thus, avoidance of caffeine during lactation is critical.

Because of the persistence of OTA in the food chain, exposure to the compound is a potential human health hazard. This has prompted adoption of regulatory limits in several countries which, in turn, implies the development of suitable validated and official analytical methods and rapid screening tests for cost-effective food control on a large scale. Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD), coupled with immunoaffinity column (IAC) clean-up, is the most widely employed analytical technique. LC coupled with electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (MS) has detection limits comparable with those of LC-FLD and the selectivity of IAC can be achieved by tandem (MS-MS) or sequential (MS(n)) detection. Synthetic counterparts to natural antibodies in the form of molecularly imprinted polymers seem a promising alternative to IAC for sample preparation.

Cap to stalk mercury concentration quotients were from 1.0+/-0.4 in poison pax (Paxillus involutus) to 2.8+/-0.7 in slippery jack (Suillus luteus). Brown cort (Cortinarius malicorius), fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), orange-brown ringless amanita (A. fulva), red-aspen bolete (Leccinum rufum) and mutagen milk cap (Lactarius necator) contained the highest concentrations of mercury both in caps and stalks, and mean concentrations varied between 600+/-750 and 920+/-280 and 370+/-470 and 560+/-220 ng/g dry matter, respectively. An estimate of daily intake of mercury from mushroom consumption indicated that the flesh of edible species of mushrooms may not pose hazards to human health even at a maximum consumption rate of 28 g/day. However, it should be noted that mercury intake from other foods will augment the daily intake rates. Species such as the sickener (Russula emetica), Geranium-scented russula (R. fellea) and poison pax (P. involutus) did not concentrate mercury as evidenced from the bioconcentration factors (BCFs: concentrations in mushroom/concentration in soil substrate), which were less than 1. Similarly, red-hot milk cap (L. rufus), rickstone funnel cap (Clitocybe geotropa) and European cow bolete (S. bovinus) were observed to be weak accumulators of mercury. Fly agaric (A. muscaria) accumulated great concentrations of mercury with BCFs reaching 73+/-42 and 38+/-22 in caps and stalks, respectively. Mercury BCFs of between 4.0+/-2.3 and 23+/-25 (caps) and 2.6+/-1.9 and 14+/-12 (stalks) were noted for the other mushroom species. Relatively great concentrations of mercury in fly agaric (A. muscaria) were due to preferential uptake of this element by this species.",Chemosphere,"['D000363', 'D004784', 'D006801', 'D008628', 'D011044', 'D012016', 'D012989', 'D013054', 'D014018', 'D014116']","['Agaricales', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Mercury', 'Poland', 'Reference Values', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Toxicology']","Mercury in wild mushrooms and underlying soil substrate from Koszalin, North-central Poland.","['Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379']","['chemistry', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14581048,2004
14555402,"Agent Orange, a phenoxyherbicide contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), was used by American military forces during the United States-Vietnam war between 1962 and 1971 primarily as a defoliant to destroy forests where enemy troops might find cover. Agent Orange was used mainly in Vietnam, but also to a lesser extent in Laos and Cambodia. In Laos, there have been no prior studies of TCDD contamination from Agent Orange, despite known defoliation and documented records of Agent Orange spraying. This article presents findings of TCDD in human blood and milk from two geographic areas in Laos: Vientiane, a nonsprayed area, and Sepone, an Agent Orange-sprayed area. German and Canadian laboratories used high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to measure 7 dioxin, 10 dibenzofuran, and 4 non-ortho or coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls in Laotian blood and milk samples. Most subjects tested in this Laos Ministry of Health Study showed low dioxin and dibenzofuran levels, consistent with what would be expected in a primarily rural nonindustrial country. These findings are consistent with relatively low dioxin and dibenzofuran levels recently found in food from these same areas. The chemically and toxicologically related non-ortho PCBs were measured but were found at low levels compared to specimens from other countries, presumably because of less industrialization and industrial pollution in Laos.",Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

Other milk and dairy products were chiefly collected during the summer season. Low-fat milk from the summer season had significantly lower median iodine concentration (88 microg/l, range 63-122 microg/l) compared with low-fat milk from the winter season (232 microg/l, range 103-272 microg/l). The median iodine concentration of organic summer milk (60 microg/l) was significantly lower than the iodine concentration of organic winter milk (127 microg/l). There were no significant differences in the low-fat-milk samples with regard to geographical sampling location.

12850887,"Locust bean gum acts as a milk thickener in infant formula because of its high apparent viscosity. The effects of such thickening agents on metabolic and physiologic responses during infancy have not been clarified sufficiently. Due to the increased volume of the digest and the bulking and trapping effects, digestion and absorption of nutrients may be influenced in presence of locust bean gum. The central question addressed in this paper is whether the thickening properties of locust bean gum affect the availability of calcium, iron, and zinc. Increasing amounts of powdered locust bean gum were homogenised with infant formula and samples were diluted to 0.14, 0.27, 0.42 and 0.71 g/100 ml. Viscosity of the samples was measured by a Carrie-Med CSL100 rheometer. Available amounts of calcium, iron, and zinc were evaluated using a continuous-flow dialysis model with preliminary digestion. Elemental contents of samples and dialysates were analysed with atomic absorption spectrometry. The first set of experiments showed that addition of locust bean gum to infant formulas increased the viscosity of the luminal contents. Correlations between the locust bean gum concentration and the viscosity of the samples before and after gastric or intestinal digestion were highly significant (0.97). In the second set of experiments, the correlations between the locust bean gum concentration and the amounts of calcium trapped by the locust bean gum fraction also showed high significance (0.93). In the third experimental design, again strong correlations were found between the viscosity of the intestinal digest and the amounts of calcium trapped by the fibre fraction (0.90). For iron and zinc, no such relationships were found. From this experimental set-up it appears that locust bean gum influences calcium availability in infant formulas by means of its physical properties to act as thickening agent, rather than its chemical ability to form complexes as demonstrated earlier with respect to iron and zinc.",International journal of food sciences and nutrition,"['D001682', 'D002118', 'D005685', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007225', 'D007501', 'D008351', 'D009753', 'D053149', 'D011134', 'D014783', 'D015032']","['Biological Availability', 'Calcium', 'Galactans', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Food', 'Iron', 'Mannans', 'Nutritive Value', 'Plant Gums', 'Polysaccharides', 'Viscosity', 'Zinc']","Do thickening properties of locust bean gum affect the amount of calcium, iron and zinc available for absorption from infant formula?

Frozen commercially available spinach in New Zealand contains 736.6+/-20.4 mg/100g wet matter (WM) soluble oxalate and 220.1+/-96.5mg/100g WM insoluble oxalate. The frozen spinach contained 90mg total calcium/100g WM, 76.7%of this calcium was unavailable as it was bound to oxalate as insoluble oxalate. The oxalate/calcium (mEq) ratio of the frozen spinach was 4.73. When frozen convenience food is grilled there is no opportunity for the soluble oxalates to be leached out into the cooking water and discarded. Soluble oxalates, when consumed, have the ability to bind to calcium in the spinach and any calcium in foods consumed with the spinach, reducing the absorption of soluble oxalate. In this experiment 10 volunteers ingested 100g grilled spinach alone or with 100g additions of cottage cheese, sour cream and sour cream with Calci-Trim milk (180 g) and finally, with 20g olive oil.

12810268,"Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis IPLA 729 is a nisin Z producer isolated from raw milk cheese able to grow and produce nisin Z in milk. The ability of this strain to inhibit the growth of Clostridium tyrobutyricum CECT 4011, a late blowing agent, in Vidiago cheese, a semi-hard farmhouse variety, manufactured in Asturias, Northern Spain, was investigated. For control purposes, cheeses were manufactured with the mesophilic mixed starter IPLA-001. In experimental cheeses, the nisin-producing strain L. lactis IPLA 729 was combined with this starter. Nisin Z activity reached a concentration of 1600 AU/ml in 1-day cheeses and this level was maintained until 15 days of ripening. Furthermore, to compare the inhibitory activity of the nisin-producing strain to nitrate, cheeses were also manufactured with a commercial starter culture and potassium nitrate as anti-blowing agent was added in accordance with Vidiago's cheesemakers. The control, experimental and commercial cheeses were contaminated with C. tyrobutyricum CECT 4011. The composition of the three different cheeses showed only slight differences with respect to total solids, protein and fat, although control and experimental cheeses showed a richer flavour-compound profile than commercial cheeses.

Four replicate cheesemaking trials of three treatments (control, MPC1, and MPC2) were conducted. The control cheese (CC) was made from standardized milk (casein-to-fat ratio, C/F approximately 1.7) obtained by mixing skim milk and whole milk (WM); MPC1 and MPC2 cheeses were made from standardized milk (C/F approximately 1.8) obtained from mixing WM and MPC, except that commercial mesophilic starter was added at the rate of 1% to the CC and MPC1 and 2% to MPC2 vats. The addition of MPC doubled cheese yields and had insignificant effects on fat recoveries (approximately 94% in MPC1 and MPC2 vs. approximately 92% in CC) but increased significantly total solids recoveries (approximately 63% in CC vs. 63% in MPC1 and MPC2). Although minor differences were noted in the gross composition of the cheeses, both MPC1 and MPC2 cheeses had lower lactose contents (0.25 or 0.32%, respectively) than in CC (0.60%) 7 d post manufacture. Cheeses from all three treatments had approximately 10(9) cfu/g initial starter bacteria count. The nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) grew slowly in MPC1 and MPC2 cheeses during ripening compared to CC, and at the end of 6 mo of ripening, numbers of NSLAB in the CC were 1 to 2 log cycles higher than in MPC1 and MPC2 cheeses. Primary proteolysis, as noted by water-soluble N contents, was markedly slower in MPC1 and MPC2 cheeses compared to CC. The concentrations of total free amino acids were in decreasing order CC > MPC2 > MPC1 cheeses, suggesting slower secondary proteolysis in the MPC cheeses than in CC.

12769739,"There are many examples of biologically active food proteins, with physiological significance beyond the pure nutritional requirements that concern available nitrogen for normal growth and maintenance. Moreover, there are many physiologically active peptides, derived by protease activity from various food protein sources; however, relationships between structural properties and functional activities have not been completely elucidated. Many bioactive peptides have in common structural properties that include a relatively short peptide residue length (e.g. 2-9 amino acids), possessing hydrophobic amino acid residues in addition to proline, lysine or arginine groups. Bioactive peptides are also resistant to the action of digestion peptidases. Antihypertensive peptides, known as Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been derived from milk, corn and fish protein sources. Peptides with opioid activities are derived from wheat gluten or casein, following digestion with pepsin. Exorphins, or opioid peptides derived from food proteins such as wheat and milk (e.g. exogenous sources) have similar structure to endogenous opioid peptides, with a tyrosine residue located at the amino terminal or bioactive site. Immunomodulatory peptides derived from tryptic hydrolysates of rice and soybean proteins act to stimulate superoxide anions (reactive oxygen species-ROS), which triggers non-specific immune defense systems. Antioxidant properties that prevent peroxidation of essential fatty acids have also been shown for peptides derived from milk proteins. The addition of a Leu or Pro residue to the N-terminus of a His-His, dipeptide will enhance antioxidant activity and facilitate further synergy with non-peptide antioxidants (e.g. BHT). We also show herein, that the tryptic digests of casein yielding caseinophosphopeptides exhibits both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity due to both metal ion sequestering and quenching of ROS. The separation and purification of bioactive peptides which will involve development of automated and continuous systems is an important field for Food chemists. Much effort has been given to develop selective column chromatography methods that can replace batch methods of salting out, or using solvent extraction to isolate and purify bioactive peptides. Advances here will enable recovery of bioactive peptides with minimal destruction thus enabling utilization by returning these active peptides to functional food or specific nutraceutical applications.",Current pharmaceutical design,"['D000276', 'D000890', 'D000975', 'D003611', 'D004044', 'D002523', 'D004527', 'D005396', 'D005502', 'D006801', 'D008903', 'D018847', 'D010455', 'D010940']","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Dairy Products', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Edible Grain', 'Egg Proteins', 'Fish Products', 'Food', 'Humans', 'Minerals', 'Opioid Peptides', 'Peptides', 'Plant Proteins']",Bioactive proteins and peptides from food sources.

Cows were fed total mixed rations containing (dry matter basis) 44% corn silage, 22% alfalfa silage, 2% urea, and 31% concentrate. The basal diet contained 31% high-moisture corn; equal N from one of four protein supplements was added to the other diets at the expense of corn: 9% solvent soybean meal (SSBM), 10% expeller soybean meal (ESBM), 5.5% blood meal (BM), and 7% corn gluten meal (CGM). Omasal sampling was used to quantify total AA N (TAAN) and nonammonia N (NAN) flows from the rumen. Estimates of RUP were made from differences between total and microbial N flows, including a correction for RUP in the basal diet. Modifying a spectrophotometric assay improved total purine recovery from isolated bacteria and omasal samples and gave estimates of microbial TAAN and NAN flows that were similar to a standard HPLC method. Linear programming, based on AA patterns of the diet and isolated omasal bacteria and ruminal protozoa, appeared to overestimate microbial TAAN and NAN flows compared to the purine assays. Yields of microbial TAAN and NAN determined using any method was not affected by diet and averaged 32 to 35 g NAN per kilogram of organic matter truly digested in the rumen. On average, National Research Council (NRC) equations underpredicted microbial N flows by 152 g/d (vs. HPLC), 168 g/d (vs. spectrophotometry), and 244 g/d (vs. linear programming).

Two byproducts (a tetrabromo isomer and a tribromo congener) were investigated as well. The byproducts of the synthesis were not identified in the environmental samples investigated. Previously described natural brominated compounds (BC-1, BC-2, BC-3, BC-10, BC-11, MHC-1) and anthropogenic brominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-154) were detected in a sample of human milk. The sample was from a woman from the Faeroe Islands who frequently consumed fish as well as whale blubber and meat. The most abundant compound originated from the natural tetrabromo phenoxyanisole BC-3 which may have a 3:1 distribution of bromine on the two phenyl units. This sample also accumulated a dibromochloroanisole, as well as a previously unknown mixed halogenated compound (MHC-X) and an unknown, most likely aromatic brominated compound.

Simultaneous Pu, Am and Np analyses therefore require omission of the oxidation stage and some loss of Pu data quality. Analyses were performed using a magnetic sector ICP-MS (Finnigan MAT Element). The sample is introduced to the plasma via an ultrasonic nebuliser-desolvation unit (Cetac USN 6000AT+). This combination achieves an instrumental sensitivity of 238U > 2 x 10(7) cps/ppb and removes hydrogen from the sample gas, which also inhibits the formation of 238U1H. The net effect of the improved sample introduction conditions is to achieve detection levels for Pu of 0.020 pg g(-1) (4.6 x 10(-2) Bq kg(-1)) which is significantly below 1/10th of the most stringent EU (European Union) legislation, currently 0.436 pg g(-1) (1 Bq kg(-1)) set for baby food. The new method was evaluated with a range of biological samples ranging from cabbage to milk and meat.

Dairy GS were obtained from the Folch's upper (hydrophilic) and lower (lipophilic) extraction phases, respectively, and determined as lipid-bound sialic acid (LBSA) by colorimetry. Molar ratios of LBSA in the hydro- and lipophilic GS fractions were 52:48 to 79:21. Mature buffalo milk types had 40-100% more LBSA in the lipophilic GS fraction compared to SCM. Liquid PBC was higher in LBSA (24 nmol/g) compared to mature milk types (8-11 nmol/g). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and scanning densitometry showed distinct profiles of hydrophilic and lipophilic GS fractions. Lipophilic GS (but importantly not hydrophilic GS) from IBM and its serum decreased prostaglandin series 2 production by 75-80% in cultured human colonic epithelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Hydrophilic GD(3) and lipophilic GM(3) selectively bound rotavirus particles prepared from a rhesus strain and its mutant. A GS fraction in IBM showed a GM(1)-specific binding to cholera toxin subunit B (CTB). IBM serum (IBMS) was a rich source of LBSA (420 nmol/g proteins). In summary, improved methodology led to increased LBSA recovery and isolation of additional and bioactive milk GS. Human and Italian buffalo milk had similar CTB binding, and both had increased polysialo-GS compared to cows milk. The toxin binding properties of buffalo milk GS, and the anti-inflammatory activity of the lipophilized GS fraction could be important for developing innovative food applications, as well as the subject of future research.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,"['D000818', 'D002020', 'D002460', 'D002772', 'D002852', 'D002855', 'D005732', 'D006801', 'D007558', 'D008892', 'D019158', 'D010154', 'D012401', 'D013557']","['Animals', 'Buffaloes', 'Cell Line', 'Cholera Toxin', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Gangliosides', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Milk', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid', 'Pakistan', 'Rotavirus', 'Switzerland']",Characterization and biological activity of gangliosides in buffalo milk.,"[None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12573454,2003

The method was performed at low contamination levels, which represent relevant contents in food, and is an extension of the European standard (method NF-EN-1528, Parts 1-4). It enlarges the applicable scope of the reference EN method to pyrethroid pesticides and proposes the use of solid-phase extraction (SPE) as a cleanup procedure. Cryogenic extraction was made, and SPE cleanup was performed with 2 successive SPE cartridges: C18 and Florisil. After injection of the purified extract onto a GC column, residues were measured by electron capture detection. Food samples (liquid milk, beef fat, mixed fish, and mixed eggs) were prepared, tested for homogeneity, and sent to 17 laboratories in France. Test portions were spiked with 27 pesticides and 7 PCBs at levels from 26 to 45, 4 to 27, 31 to 67, and 19 to 127 ng/g into milk, eggs, fish, and fat, respectively.

""SFE-plus-C(18)"", a recently developed supercritical fluid extraction method employing C(18) adsorbent in the extraction chamber, can enable selective extraction of low-polarity compounds in lipid-rich biological matrixes without a cleanup step. This study reports the application of the SFE-plus-C(18) method to the quantification of: 1. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in commercially purchased smoked fish; and 2. anti-cancer agents cyclophosphamide (CP) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) spiked into homogenized whole bovine milk. Over the course of SFE-plus-C(18)extraction, indigenous lipids are preferentially retained on the C(18) adsorbent. Compared with the conventional method, only 8-15% of the lipids in the smoked fish sample, and only 6-18% of the lipids in the milk sample, were co-extracted by SFE-plus-C(18). This reduction in the quantity of background lipids significantly improved chromatographic separations, retarded deterioration of the column, and dramatically improved the ability to quantify PAH present at trace levels in smoked fish by GC-MS. Using the SFE-plus-C(18) method, ten targeted PAH were detected in the range 9.5-13.5 ng g(-1) in the smoked fish sample.

12424324,"Recent epidemiological studies have suggested that the consumption of tomatoes and tomato-based food products reduce the risk of prostate cancer in humans. This protective effect has been attributed to carotenoids, which are one of the major classes of phytochemicals in this fruit. The most abundant carotenoid in tomato is lycopene, followed by phytoene, phytofluene, zeta-carotene, gamma-carotene, beta-carotene, neurosporene, and lutein. The distribution of lycopene and related carotenoids in tomatoes and tomato-based food products has been determined by extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-UV/Visible photodiode array detection. Detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of human serum, milk, and organs, particularly prostate, have revealed the presence of all the aforementioned carotenoids in biologically significant concentrations. Two oxidative metabolites of lycopene, 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diols A and B, which are only present in tomatoes in extremely low concentrations, have been isolated and identified in human serum, milk, organs (liver, lung, breast, liver, prostate, colon) and skin. Carotenoids may also play an important role in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, and other blinding disorders. Among 25 dietary carotenoids and nine metabolites routinely found in human serum, mainly (3R,3'R,6'R)-lutein, (3R,3'R)-zeaxanthin, lycopene, and their metabolites were detected in ocular tissues. In this review we identified and quantified the complete spectrum of carotenoids from pooled human retinal pigment epithelium, ciliary body, iris, lens, and in the uveal tract and in other tissues of the human eye to gain a better insight into the metabolic pathways of ocular carotenoids. Although (3R,3'R,6'R)-lutein, (3R,3'R)-zeaxanthin, and their metabolites constitute the major carotenoids in human ocular tissues, lycopene and a wide range of dietary carotenoids have been detected in high concentrations in ciliary body and retinal pigment epithelium.

To do so, the total (bonded and free) 7-ketocholesterol content was measured in ten fresh human mature milk samples and in ten milk adapted formula samples by high performance liquid chromatography and diode array detection. The 7-ketocholesterol human milk content (0.7+/-0.3) was often below the quantifiable limit (0.5 microg/g of extracted lipids) while 7-ketocholesterol adapted milk concentrations were often above (3.6+/-4.0) this limit. The 7-ketocholesterol content of adapted formula samples was significantly higher as compared to human milk samples (P<0.05). This is the first study to provide data concerning the concentrations of cholesterol oxides in human milk and in formula milk. Our results clearly suggest that the manufacturing technologies employed and the nutrient extractive sources play a crucial role in the development of cholesterol oxides in the end product. Careful surveillance has to be paid in order to avoid alteration of bioactive properties of nutrients and/or development of potentially toxic derivative compounds.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","['D002784', 'D002851', 'D004791', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007225', 'D007231', 'D007653', 'D008055', 'D008895']","['Cholesterol', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ketocholesterols', 'Lipids', 'Milk, Human']",7-ketocholesterol in human and adapted milk formulas.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381334,2003
12271441,"A rapid and accurate method to identify bovine and ewe milk adulteration of fresh water buffalo mozzarella cheese by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) is described. The differentiation among mozzarella made from water buffalo milk and from mixtures of less expensive bovine and, more recently, ewe milk with water buffalo milk is achieved using whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulins as molecular markers. It is worth noting that the method proposed here is, to our knowledge, the first strategy able to characterize possible fraudulent additions of ewe milk in samples of water buffalo milk devoted to the production of water buffalo mozzarella cheese. In addition, a linear relationship was found between the relative response of the molecular ion and the abundance of the analysed whey proteins. This demonstrates that this approach can be used to determine the amount of bovine or ovine milk added to water buffalo milk employed for mozzarella cheese production. Furthermore, this method also appears suitable for the analysis of ewe cheese.

As confirmed by further investigations the precaecal digestibility is a valuable measure for determining the availability of native B-vitamins. Therefore, pigs were fitted with an end-to-end ileo-rectal anastomosis for digesta passing straight from ileum to rectum, thus avoiding endogenous vitamin synthesis by the colon. Three weeks after surgery the digestibility experiments were carried out during which the animals were fed various experimental diets for a period of 12 days and digesta were collected quantitatively twice a day during the final 5 days of this period.

These organochlorine levels were measured using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry. By a self-administered dietary history questionnaire, the usual dietary intake was estimated. Their median levels (range) were as follows: beta-HCH, 0.50 (0.05-1.50); HCB, 0.20 (0.02-0.70); and total DDT (p,p'-DDE + p,p'-DDT), 5.0 (0.9-31.0) ng/ml serum. Levels of p,p'-DDD were detected in only seven subjects (0.05-0.6 ng/ml serum). The beta-HCH levels were increased with rice and milk intakes, but the least squares means were not simply increased according to the quartile of the intakes. Concerning HCB, fish intake showed a borderline significant correlation (0.20, P = 0.052). In terms of total DDT, intakes of meat, fish, vegetable and milk showed a positive relationship, although none of them provided statistically significant results. No other statistically significant relation between any organochlorines and any food intakes examined was observed in this study.

The area of the study is a background site with no known local sources of mercury emission. The mercury concentrations of the fruiting bodies varied largely (range between 14 and 14,000 ng/g dry weight) depending on the site and mushroom species investigated, but were less varied in soil samples (between 5 and 86 ng/g dry weight). The fruiting bodies of king bolete (Boletus edulis) showed greatest content of mercury. King bolete and yellow-cracking bolete (Xerocomus subtomentosus) collected from the Borecka Forest both contained in the caps around threefold greater concentrations of mercury than were noted for the same species collected from the surrounding area with 9,900 +/- 2,700 and 3,600 +/- 1,400, and 480 +/- 190 and 160 +/- 70 ng/g dry weight, respectively. Apart from the king bolete, relatively elevated concentrations of mercury were quantified also in a whole fruiting bodies of common puffball (Lycoperdon perlatum) with 3,400 +/- 1,300 ng/g as well as in the caps and stalks of common scaber stalk (Leccinum scabrum) with 1,200 +/- 740 and 1,100 +/- 380 ng/g dry weight. In other species investigated, the mercury concentrations were below 1,000 ng/g dry weight, and the smallest values were noted for crab-scended brittle gills (Russula xerampelina) with 60 +/- 20 in the caps and 40 +/- 20 ng/g dry weight in the stalks. For the species such as larch bolete, bay bolete (Xerocomus badius), yellow-cracking bolete, king bolete, common scaber stalk, fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), crab-scented brittle gills, honey mushroom (Amariella mellea) and safron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus) a positive correlation (0.01 < p < 0.05) between the mercury content and size (diameter) of the caps was found, and in some cases also between mercury content of the stalks and size (height) of the fruiting body. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) values of total mercury were greatest for king bolete, i.e., 250 +/- 65 in the caps and 140 +/- 47 in the stalks, while for the other species investigated were between 200 +/- 91 and 1.8 +/- 0.5 in the caps, and 94 +/- 57 and 1.7 +/- 0.4 in the stalks. Nevertheless, despite great values of BCF of mercury indicated for some species and also a positive correlation between mercury content of the caps/stalks and underlying soil substrate, subsequent coefficients of determination were usually below 40%, and only for bay bolete (stalk), yellow-cracking bolete (cap), common scaber stalk (cap), hard bolete (Leccinum griseum) (cap, stalk), crab-scented gills (stalk), and honey mushroom (cap) were up to 68, 82, 42, 82, 51, 74, and 45%, respectively.

The pattern of HMX accumulation for alfalfa (Medicago sativa), bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), canola (Brassica rapa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and perennial ryegrass (Loliumperenne) grown in a controlled environment on contaminated soil from an anti-tank firing range was similar to that observed for plants (wild bergamot (Monarda fistulosa), western wheat grass (Agropyron smithii), brome grass (Bromus sitchensis), koeleria (Koeleria gracilis), goldenrod (Solidago sp.), blueberry (Vaccinium sp.), anemone (Anemone sp.), common thistle (Circium vulgare), wax-berry (Symphoricarpos albus), western sage (Artemisia gnaphalodes), and Drummond's milk vetch (Astragalus drummondii)) collected from the range. No direct evidence of plant-mediated HMX (bio)chemical transformation was provided by the available analytical methods. Traces of mononitroso-HMX were found in contaminated soil extracts and were also observed in leaf extracts.

It ranged between 0.04 and 1.04 mg As/kg hair, about 55% of the analysed hair samples were within the range of allowable values (0.08-0.25 mg As/kg hair), but 45% were not. There were no considerable sex-related differences (0.303 and 0.292 mg As/kg hair for males and females, respectively). Different educational levels did not influence it either, when the effect of the age had been excluded. Children and adolescents proved to be more susceptible to arsenic as their mean levels (0.353 microg/g), and were significantly higher than those in the adults (0.233 microg/g). Smoking and some dietary habits had an important role in the elevation of arsenic levels among the nonoccupational Egyptian population: 60% of smokers and 66.7% of indoor passive smokers had arsenic levels >0.25 mg As/kg hair. Arsenic levels were also dependent on the kind of smoking, as hair arsenic of the subject smoking molasses tobacco was found to be significantly higher than that of cigarette smokers (0.459 and 0.209 mg As/kg hair, respectively). The frequency of meat and fish consumption per week was also found to be positively, significantly correlated with arsenic levels. On the other hand, the frequency of consumption of fruits, fresh and cooked vegetables, milk and milk products per week beneficially influenced the arsenic level of the hair samples examined. Arsenic content of the consumed water in Egypt was 0.001 mg/l, which is below the maximum drinking water level allowed by World Health Organisation (WHO). Therefore, the arsenic content of domestic tap water hardly contributed to the arsenic exposure of the Egyptian population in the regions of the study.

Flavor quality of NDM is a critical parameter because it can directly impact final product quality. Flavors can be formed in NDM during subsequent storage. Identification of compounds responsible for storage-induced flavors is necessary to correlate sensory quality with potential sources of the flavors. Six NDM samples were selected for volatile flavor analysis based on sensory analysis and storage time. Volatile components were extracted by direct solvent extraction/high vacuum distillation. Volatile extracts were separated into neutral/basic and acidic fractions and analyzed by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GCO) and aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA). A variety of aldehydes, ketones, and free fatty acids were responsible for generation of flavors in stored NDM. The following compounds exhibited high aroma impact by AEDA: 3-(methylthio)propanal (boiled potato); o-aminoacetophenone (corn tortilla); 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone and 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one (burnt sugar); butanoic acid (cheesy); pentanoic acid (sweaty); acetic and hexanoic acids (sour/vinegar); octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acids (waxy); p-cresol (cowy/barny); 3-methylindole (fecal); dimethyl trisulfide (cabbage); (E,E)-2,4-decadienal (fried/fatty); furfuryl alcohol (rubber/vitamin); phenylacetic acid (rose-like); and 1-octen-3-one (mushroom).",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002849', 'D005511', 'D008401', 'D008892', 'D009812', 'D013649', 'D014835']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Food Handling', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Odorants', 'Taste', 'Volatilization']",Volatile flavor components of stored nonfat dry milk.,"[None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11782199,2002

Daily intakes of micronutrients were only about half of the daily intake estimated for non-Hispanic white females and infants in the U.S. NHANES III. Estimates of daily intakes from breast milk were also considerably lower for the migrant and Australian infants compared with the values extracted from tables of food composition and dietary recall for non-Hispanic white infants in the U.S. NHANES III. For example, Ca was a factor of approximately 3 times lower, Fe approximately 50, and Zn approximately 4. We consider our estimates a reliable indication of the daily intakes for several reasons, including the collection of up to nine quarterly collections of 6-day duplicate diets and retention of subjects in a longitudinal prospective study.

11599989,"Inulin and oligofructose exhibit valuable nutritional and functional attributes, so they are used as supplements as soluble fiber or as macronutrient substitutes. As classic analytical methods for dietary fiber measurement are not effective, several specific methods have been proposed. These methods measure total fructans and are based on one or more enzymatic sample treatments and determination of released sugars. To determine inulin for labeling purposes, we developed an easy and rapid anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method following water extraction of inulin. HPLC conditions included an Aminex HPX- 87C column (Bio-Rad), deionized water at 85 degrees C as the mobile phase and a refractive index detector. The tested foods included tailor-made food products containing known amounts of inulin and commercial products (cookies, milk, ice creams, cheese, and cereal bars). The average recovery was 97%, and the coefficient of variation ranged from 1.1 to 5% in the food matrixes. The obtained results showed that this method provides an easier, faster and cheaper alternative than previous techniques for determining inulin with enough accuracy and precision for routine labeling purposes by direct determination of inulin by HPLC with refractive index detection.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D002851', 'D002523', 'D005504', 'D005515', 'D007054', 'D007444', 'D008892', 'D009844']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Labeling', 'Ice Cream', 'Inulin', 'Milk', 'Oligosaccharides']",Inulin determination for food labeling.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11599989,2001

Both microbiological and chemical analyses revealed an accumulation of material over the cycles to a maximum level. Surfaces were conditioned rapidly to saturation with organic material within one cycle (XPS), whereas fouling by microorganisms was less rapid (five cycles). Cleaning with detergent tended to retard the cumulative fouling process when compared with spray cleaning using water alone.

An attempt was made to correlate the released peptides with the proteolytic systems potentially involved during Emmental cheese manufacture. Besides the well-known action of plasmin on beta- and alpha(s2)-caseins, and in the absence of residual fungal coagulant from Endothia parasitica, two other proteinases seem to be involved in the hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-casein in Emmental cheese: cathepsin D originated from milk and cell-envelope proteinase from thermophilic starters.

All mothers were on their habitual diet. Food records (95 items) were administered to the mothers, six-times during the first month of lactation (1 day after delivery, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after colostrum appearance) and referred to maternal dietary intake of the day before. Milk collected on day 1 was considered as colostrum, day 4 and 7 samples as transitional milk, and day 14, 21 and 28 samples as mature milk. Five gas chromatographic analyses were performed on each sample. Statistics were made using Friedman's and Pearson's test. Maternal dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were significantly related to the corresponding milk pattern in the phase of transitional milk (P<0.01), while total polyunsaturated (PUFAs) content was significantly related only to the mature milk (P<0.01); in this phase about 42% of the variations occurring in PUFAs milk content can be related to variation of maternal PUFAs dietary intake. The results in the present study provide evidence of the relationships between maternal diet and milk composition. The degree of correlation between maternal diet and PUFAs milk content increases throughout milk maturational process and reaches significance only in mature milk.

The contaminated sediment of the former seabed has been disseminated over the surrounding area by strong winds. This deterioration of the ecosystem has created a hazardous situation for the health of approximately 3.5 million people. This pilot study was undertaken to assist Karakalpak health workers in investigating the degree of exposure to metals, persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and dioxins during the most vulnerable prenatal and postnatal period and to provide guidelines for future research. All subjects came from areas located within 200 km of the southern border of the Aral Sea. Blood was obtained from 18 pregnant women and 28 newborns (cord blood) to determine the levels of metals, lead, cadmium, zinc and selenium and the OCPs alpha-, beta- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH; lindane is the product name of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and isomers and metabolites of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), i.e. op-DDT, pp-DDT, pp-DDE and pp-TDE. Levels of metals were also determined in blood from 28 non-pregnant women. In addition, levels of 17 dioxins were determined in 41 human milk samples and 1batch of formula. Information about possible dietary sources of the fat-soluble OCPs and dioxins was obtained from a pooled sample of butter and from seven cottonseed oil samples. A mass-selective detector coupled to a gas chromatograph equipped with a large volume injector was used to analyse the selected OCPs, whereas the dioxins were determined by gas chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The levels of metals in cord and maternal blood were consistent with concentrations observed in European countries. Only three women (7%) had lead levels greater than 100 ppb. The most notable pollutants in maternal and cord blood were the OCPs, notably HCB, beta-HCH, pp-DDE and the most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-TCDD, when calculated as TEQs. A similar pattern was observed in human milk: beta-HCH and pp-DDE levels of more than 1,000 ng g(-1) fat were found in 68 and 43% of the subjects, respectively. Levels of 2,3,7,8-TCDD were six times higher than those observed in Western Europe. Traces of pp-DDE were detected in the batch of formula milk. Contaminated animal fat, but not cottonseed oil, is the most likely dietary source of OCPs and dioxins.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)","['D002104', 'D004041', 'D004147', 'D005260', 'D005312', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D006843', 'D007306', 'D007854', 'D008431', 'D008670', 'D008895', 'D010865', 'D011247', 'D012643', 'D014610', 'D015032']","['Cadmium', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dioxins', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated', 'Insecticides', 'Lead', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Metals', 'Milk, Human', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Selenium', 'Uzbekistan', 'Zinc']","Levels of certain metals, organochlorine pesticides and dioxins in cord blood, maternal blood, human milk and some commonly used nutrients in the surroundings of the Aral Sea (Karakalpakstan, Republic of Uzbekistan).","['Q000378', None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000097', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","['metabolism', None, 'blood', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'blood', 'metabolism', None, 'blood', 'chemistry', None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11519985,2001

Sample recoveries, repeatability, and analyses of NIST and CBR-CEC reference materials demonstrated the reliability and accuracy of this technique. Mean zinc concentrations varied from 0.02 microg/ml in fresh water to 71.0 microg/g (fresh weight) in pork liver. The daily dietary intake of zinc for inhabitants of southeastern Spain was estimated to be 10.1 mg (5.5, 4.0, 0.5, and 0.1 mg Zn/day per person from foods of animal and vegetable origin, drinks, and other foods, respectively). Zinc levels found in high protein foods (meat, fish, milk products, eggs, dry fruits, cereals and legumes) were significantly higher than those found in food with a low protein content (vegetables, fruits and drinks) (p < 0.001). A significant linear correlation between zinc levels and the corresponding protein content of cereals, legumes and dry fruits was found (r = 0.754, p < 0.005). Zinc concentrations in milk samples were significantly modified by the thermal treatment (p < 0.001), and the skimming (p < 0.05) and calcium enrichment processes (p < 0.001). Shellfish zinc levels were also significantly higher than those measured in fish (p < 0.05).

11448582,"Although it is accepted that dietary fiber probably is not needed in the diets of infants younger than 1 y, babies suffering from regurgitation are often fed with infant formulas thickened with considerable amounts of fiber. The effect of increasing amounts of alginic acid, locust-bean gum, and guar gum was studied from casein and whey-based infant formulas. A dialysis in vitro method with preliminary intraluminal digestion, adapted to the conditions of infants younger than 6 mo, was used. Human milk was used as the reference standard. Elemental contents of samples and dialysates were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Soluble dietary fiber inhibited mineral availability more in casein than in whey-based formulas. Mineral availabilities from casein- and whey-based formulas supplemented with 0.42 g of locust-bean gum/100 mL were 9.4% (0.7) and 10.4% (0.6) for calcium (P < 0.05), 0.32% (0.08) and 1.45% (0.17) for iron (P < 0.05), and 3.2% (0.2) and 5.6% (0.5) for zinc (P < 0.05), respectively. Calcium availability from the whey formula decreased in the presence of each fiber source, especially guar gum and alginic acid. Supplementing 2 g of alginic acid-based agents per 100 mL depressed calcium availability from 13.3% (1.2) to 5.3% (0.3; P < 0.05). With respect to iron and zinc, availabilities increased from 1.28% (0.28) to 6.05% (0.96; P < 0.05) and from 6.7% (0.6) to 10.2% (1.0), respectively, with the addition of 2 g of alginic acid (P < 0.05). Both gums lowered iron and zinc availabilities, and guar gum affected iron availability more severely than locust-bean gum did. Iron availabilities were 1.45% (0.17) from formula thickened with locust-bean gum (0.42 g/100 mL) and 0.92% (0.15) from formula thickened with guar gum (P < 0.05). Adding thickening agents based on soluble dietary fiber to traditional infant formulas probably affects calcium, iron, and zinc availability in various ways.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)","['D000464', 'D001682', 'D002136', 'D003956', 'D004043', 'D005685', 'D020723', 'D006603', 'D006801', 'D007225', 'D007227', 'D007231', 'D007408', 'D019266', 'D008351', 'D008895', 'D008954', 'D053149', 'D011134', 'D013054', 'D015032']","['Alginates', 'Biological Availability', 'Calcium, Dietary', 'Dialysis', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Galactans', 'Glucuronic Acid', 'Hexuronic Acids', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Iron, Dietary', 'Mannans', 'Milk, Human', 'Models, Biological', 'Plant Gums', 'Polysaccharides', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Zinc']","Effect of thickening agents, based on soluble dietary fiber, on the availability of calcium, iron, and zinc from infant formulas.","['Q000008', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000008', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000032', 'Q000008', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000032']","['administration & dosage', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'drug effects', 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', 'chemistry', None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11448582,2002

Three cheese batches were made, one from raw milk, another from pasteurized milk, and a third from pasteurized milk with an added native starter culture in addition to the commercial starter. Cheeses were analyzed at 1, 120, and 240 d of ripening. Analysis of the volatile components was by purge and trap connected to a gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer and disclosed a total of 76 components belonging to the following chemical families: hydrocarbons, fatty acids, esters, sulfur and carbonyl compounds, and, in particular, alcohols. Pasteurization lowered the levels of certain volatile components, especially alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones. The cheeses made from pasteurized milk showed lower scores for attributes of characteristic taste and aftertaste, as well as a characteristic aroma at 240 d of ripening. These results suggest that the components present in higher concentrations in the cheeses made from the raw milk were necessary for development of characteristic Roncal cheese aroma.

Following the use of oestradiol-containing growth-promoting agents, TMDI is increased by a factor of 4.6 to 20 ng oestradiol-17beta, assuming that single dosage and 'good animal husbandry' are observed. Pork and poultry probably contain similar amounts of oestrogens as untreated cattle. The mean concentration of oestradiol-17beta in whole milk is estimated at 6.4 pg/ml. Scarce data available on eggs report up to 200 pg/g oestradiol-17beta. The risk evaluation of oestrogenic growth-promoting agents is limited by analytical uncertainties. Residues of oestradiol-17alpha and the importance of oestrogen conjugates are widely unknown. The performance of mass spectrometry still needs to be improved for confirmation of oestrogen concentrations in most food.

11358181,"Dioxins/furans are ubiquitous environmental contaminants whose primary route of human exposure occurs via the consumption of fatty foods of animal origin. The US FDA conducted a market basket survey of dairy products and commercial fish and shellfish to obtain data on levels of 17 dioxin/furan congeners (2, 3, 7, 8-congeners) in the US. The dairy products sampled included various cheeses (American, cheddar, Swiss, cottage), ice cream, yogurt, butter, and milk. The finfish and shellfish (molluscs and crustacea) sampled are those marine species consumed in the greatest amounts and include canned tuna, shrimp, cod, blue crab, and oysters. Catfish was sampled because it is the dominant aquaculture species. Samples were collected in 1995/96 and analysis for 17 dioxin/furan congeners was performed by high-resolution gas chromatography following extraction and clean-up. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for each congener in each food were reported. Point estimates of exposure were calculated using a 3-day (1-day diary plus 2-day recall) food consumption survey for eaters-only and for the general population (USDA/CSFII, 1989-92). Toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) were used to derive overall dioxin/furan toxicity equivalents (TEQ) for each sample food. Mean estimates of TEQ exposure for each food were derived using five values for non-detects (ND = 0; ND = 1/2 LOD or LOQ, ND = LOD or LOQ) on both a total sample and eaters-only basis. Using zero and the LOD provide lower and upper bounds on the range of estimated exposure, respectively.

11351045,"It is generally not known that most commercial rodent diets are formulated with soy protein and deliver large daily doses of isoflavones to animals throughout their lifespan, including the in utero period. Here, we demonstrate that isoflavones are bioavailable and show that commercial rodent diets universally used by animal facilities lead to very high steady-state serum isoflavone concentrations in adult rats (2613 +/- 873 ng/mL) and mice (2338 +/- 531 ng/mL), exceeding the animal's endogenous estrogen level by 30,000- to 60,000-fold. We demonstrate the maternal-fetal intrauterine transfer of isoflavones in animals fed a standard Purina 5001 soy-containing diet and show that newborn rat pups have high serum isoflavones levels (540 +/- 174 ng/mL) that are maintained throughout the suckling period by passage of isoflavones into maternal milk. These findings have profound implications for all animal experiments, including multigenerational studies and studies of transgenic animals, especially if biochemical or morphological end-points are influenced by the hormonal or nonhormonal properties of phytoestrogens. These compounds have the potential to modulate genotypic and phenotypic expression in general, and therefore, all investigators should be vigilant to the phytoestrogen composition of commercial rodent diets because there is a history of potent biological effects in larger animals and in humans from high circulating isoflavone concentrations.",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,"['D000367', 'D000821', 'D000818', 'D000831', 'D000833', 'D002839', 'D002851', 'D060754', 'D004968', 'D005260', 'D019833', 'D006728', 'D007529', 'D051379', 'D023421', 'D048789', 'D028321', 'D051381']","['Age Factors', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Animals, Suckling', 'Chromans', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Equol', 'Estrogens, Non-Steroidal', 'Female', 'Genistein', 'Hormones', 'Isoflavones', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Phytoestrogens', 'Plant Preparations', 'Rats']",Animal models impacted by phytoestrogens in commercial chow: implications for pathways influenced by hormones.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000502', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'physiology', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11351045,2001

11049059,"Hypoallergenic milk formulas are used as an alternative diet for infants who have allergies to cow's milk when breast-feeding is not possible. These products are based on proteins, which have been heat-treated and hydrolyzed to a different degree in order to cleave antibody-binding structures. Even extensively hydrolyzed products have occasionally been observed to elicit allergic reactions in sensitized infants, however. Therefore, the parameters of relevance to allergenic potential require more investigation. The objective of the present study was to investigate 12 different hydrolyzed milk formulas for their contents of potentially allergenic protein material, i.e. material that may induce allergenicity or elicit allergic responses in already sensitized individuals. Analytical methods applied were gel filtration, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), native PAGE, immunoblotting, dot-immunobinding, and ELISA. Care was taken to assure that all protein fractions were investigated, including supernatants and precipitates following centrifugation of the milk formulas. By gel filtration, protein material with apparent molecular masses of 7 to >30 kDa was detected. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of formula precipitates showed that proteins with a molecular mass above 20 kDa were present even in some of the extensively hydrolyzed formulas.

11037230,"Heat (85 degrees C for 20 min) and pressure (600 MPa for 15 min) treatments were applied to skim milk fortified by addition of whey protein concentrate. Both treatments caused > 90 % denaturation of beta-lactoglobulin. During heat treatment this denaturation took place in the presence of intact casein micelles; during pressure treatment it occurred while the micelles were in a highly dissociated state. As a result micelle structure and the distribution of beta-lactoglobulin were different in the two milks. Electron microscopy and immunolabelling techniques were used to examine the milks after processing and during their transition to yogurt gels. The disruption of micelles by high pressure caused a significant change in the appearance of the milk which was quantified by measurement of the colour values L*, a* and b*. Heat treatment also affected these characteristics. Casein micelles are dynamic structures, influenced by changes to their environment. This was clearly demonstrated by the transition from the clusters of small irregularly shaped micelle fragments present in cold pressure-treated milk to round, separate and compact micelles formed on warming the milk to 43 degrees C. The effect of this transition was observed as significant changes in the colour indicators. During yogurt gel formation, further changes in micelle structure, occurring in both pressure and heat-treated samples, resulted in a convergence of colour values. However, the microstructure of the gels and their rheological properties were very different. Pressure-treated milk yogurt had a much higher storage modulus but yielded more readily to large deformation than the heated milk yogurt.

10890508,"Off-flavors in foods may originate from environmental pollutants, the growth of microorganisms, oxidation of lipids, or endogenous enzymatic decomposition in the foods. The chromatographic analysis of flavors and off-flavors in foods usually requires that the samples first be processed to remove as many interfering compounds as possible. For analysis of foods by gas chromatography (GC), sample preparation may include mincing, homogenation, centrifugation, distillation, simple solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized-fluid extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, Soxhlet extraction, or methylation. For high-performance liquid chromatography of amines in fish, cheese, sausage and olive oil or aldehydes in fruit juice, sample preparation may include solvent extraction and derivatization. Headspace GC analysis of orange juice, fish, dehydrated potatoes, and milk requires almost no sample preparation. Purge-and-trap GC analysis of dairy products, seafoods, and garlic may require heating, microwave-mediated distillation, purging the sample with inert gases and trapping the analytes with Tenax or C18, thermal desorption, cryofocusing, or elution with ethyl acetate. Solid-phase microextraction GC analysis of spices, milk and fish can involve microwave-mediated distillation, and usually requires adsorption on poly(dimethyl)siloxane or electrodeposition on fibers followed by thermal desorption. For short-path thermal desorption GC analysis of spices, herbs, coffee, peanuts, candy, mushrooms, beverages, olive oil, honey, and milk, samples are placed in a glass-lined stainless steel thermal desorption tube, which is purged with helium and then heated gradually to desorb the volatiles for analysis.

10836532,"The increase, in the last two decades, in the application of silicones (polysiloxanes) and inorganic silicon compounds in medicine and the food industry, has exposed the human body to extensive contacts with these substances. Most silicone breast implants contain a gel consisting of a crosslinked silicone elastomer swollen by silicone oil (PDMS). Diffusion of PDMS through the silicone elastomer envelope and rupture of the envelope with release of the gel contents both occur clinically. The amount and distribution of silicone compounds in various tissues are key issues in the assessment of health problems connected with silicone implants. We have measured by GFAAS the Si content of tissues from normal and implant patients and the organic solvent extractable Si levels (assumed to be silicone), using careful control of sample collection and preparation. Whole blood levels were: implant patients mean 38.8 (SD 25.6) (microg/kg), controls mean 24.2 (SD 26.7) (microg/kg) in one study and subsequently 103.8 (SD 112.1) and 74.3 (SD 86.5) (microg/kg) in another study.

Concentrations of 2,3-butanedione and 2,3-pentanedione increased 2-3-fold in mild, less acidic yogurts compared to traditional acidic ones. This is due to accumulation of the precursors of the diketones, 2-acetolactate and 2-acetohydroxybutyrate, during fermentation in mild, less acidic yogurt. These precursors are subsequently converted to the corresponding diketones during storage.

10789373,"Cadmium levels were determined in 59 baby food samples, including milk-based, cereal and milk-based and soy-based formulas, recommended from 0 to 18 months of age. Determinations were performed by Zeeman graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry, after dry ashing, with parallel determinations of certified reference samples. Mean cadmium levels were found to range from 1.10 to 23.5 micrograms/kg fresh weight concentrated formulas. Levels were related to the composition of the diets. Formulas based on cow's milk had the lowest concentrations. Soy formulas contained approximately six times more cadmium than cow's milk formulas, and diets with a cereal content had 4-21 times higher mean levels. The mean weekly intakes of dietary cadmium were estimated to vary between 0.10 and 3.05 micrograms/kg body weight of the child, if the recommended amount of formula were to be consumed at the recommended age, and if the child were of average weight. This estimation however does not include the contribution of cadmium from drinking water. The highest intake on a body weight basis was found in 6-month-old children, consuming the recommended amount of wheat-, oat- and milk-based formulas. This intake is below the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 7 micrograms/kg body weight, established by a WHO/FAO expert group.

After separation on an HPLC column, an in-line oxidation of AA and IAA to DHAA and IDHAA, respectively, is performed on a short column of activated charcoal. The dehydroascorbic acids are derivatized with a 1,2-phenylenediamine solution in a heated capillary Tefzel reactor into fluorescent quinoxaline compounds and monitored fluorometrically. The chromatographic method provides good separation of LAA, LDHAA, and their diastereoisomers in a relatively short time (-10 min). After optimization of postcolumn derivatization conditions, calibration runs and recovery tests are performed. The fluorescent response in terms of peak area is highly proportional to the concentration of all derivatives examined over a range of 0.1 to 100 microg/mL solution for LAA, LDHAA, IAA, and IDHAA. Recoveries were in the range of 97 to 103%. The detection limit is 0.1 mg of each ascorbic acid derivative per 100 g food. A wide variety of foods (fruits, fruit juices, vegetables, vegetable products, milk, liver, and sausage) are analyzed by the developed procedure.

To determine if Jersey cows responded similarly to oleamide, four lactating Jersey cows (mean 417 kg of body weight and 64 days in milk) were fed four diets in a 4x4 Latin square with 2-wk periods. Diets were total mixed ration containing 47% corn silage and 53% concentrate (dry matter basis) and were supplemented with no added fat (control), or with 3.5% added fat from either higholeic canola oil, a commercial source of oleamide, or oleamide synthesized from oleic acid and urea. The canola oil supplement had no effect on milk yield or composition. Compared to canola oil, the oleamide supplements reduced milk yield, dry matter intake, and milk fat and protein contents. Milk oleic acid concentration increased from 17.4% of total fatty acids for the control diet to 22.1% for the canola oil diet. Both oleamides further increased milk oleic acid to 30.0 and 27.1% of total fatty acids for the commercial and synthesized oleamides, respectively.

The VLDL, LDL, HDL and very high-density lipoprotein (VHDL) fractions were separated by ultracentrifugal flotation, and the amount of vitamin E associated with each fraction was determined by normal-phase HPLC. The amount and distribution of RRR-alpha-tocopherol in Lp fractions were unaffected by the form of dietary vitamin E. Plasma and Lp RRR-alpha-tocopherol concentrations increased with age (P < 0.0001) and were maximal at 28 d of age. Concentrations of RRR-alpha-tocopherol associated with Lp were 25% (P < 0.01) to 39% (P < 0.0001) lower in calves fed 35.6 and 71.2 micromol of vitamin A daily than in control calves at 28 d of age.

Subjects were requested not to consume milk, milk products, or high-vegetable diets for a day and to fast from 10 p.m. of the day preceding the test day. After consumption of the test diet (12 and 20 g of lactose or lactitol, respectively, in 250 mL water), the subjects recorded the severity of symptoms for 24 hours. Breath samples were collected after fasting and after consumption of the test diet at 30 min intervals over the 7-hour study period. Breath samples were analyzed for hydrogen using gas chromatography. After consumption of 12 g lactose, the prevalence of lactose malabsorbers was established. The increment of a peak breath hydrogen level of > or = 20 ppm above the baseline level was used as an indicator of lactose malabsorption. The lactose malabsorbers were further classified as lactose tolerance or lactose intolerance according to the gastrointestinal symptoms observed. All 39 healthy Thai adults could be classified into 3 groups as follows: 9 (23%) lactose absorbers (LA), 15 (38.5%) lactose mal-absorber/tolerance (LMT), and 15 (38.5%) lactose mal-absorber/intolerance (LMI). Using the hydrogen breath test, 67% of the subjects were identified as lactitol intolerance after the consumption of 12 g lactitol. The lactitol intolerance comprised 53.8% of LMI, 34.6% of LMT, and 11.5% of LA. Among all subjects, one third of LA (33%), two thirds of LMT (60%), and 93% of LMI were lactitol intolerant. In addition, gastrointestinal symptoms such as flatulence and abdominal pain were most pronounced in LMI. Diarrhea was also a prominent manifestation after consumption of 12 g lactitol. Therefore, it was finally decided that 20 g lactose or lactitol were not given to LMI because of the risk of gastrointestinal symptoms. After high doses (20 g) of lactose and lactitol consumption, most LMT developed more symptoms than did LA and the main symptom was diarrhea. Consumption of 20 g lactose resulted in fewer symptoms than 20 g lactitol in both LA and LMT. On the basis of the hydrogen breath test, most LA tolerated 12 g lactitol without gastrointestinal symptoms except some flatulence whereas most LMT and LMI did not. Twenty g lactitol was not tolerated by both LA and LMT because there was diarrhea among the subjects, especially in LMT. Although the hydrogen breath analysis test is the best method for identification of lactose malabsorption, it is not the best method to identify lactitol intolerance. A hydrogen concentration of 15 ppm above the baseline level was found to be the best cut-off point to indicate lactitol intolerance although sensitivity was 85% and specificity only 38% in this study. It was further concluded that there is a greater susceptibility to lactitol in human lactose malabsorbers than in lactose absorbers.

10631803,"Kuwaiti diet is exceptionally rich in fat, carbohydrates and proteins. In addition, subjects in Kuwait are exposed to extreme heat and sun light. Fatty acid profiles of human milk obtained from 19 full breast feeding Kuwaiti mothers were analyzed. Dietary patterns for individual mothers were determined by 24 h dietary recall and food frequency questionnaire. The fatty acid content of human milk was affected by the diet consumed by the lactating mother. The content of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) in human milk lipids did not correlate with their parent fatty acids like linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids. However the human milk LCP were related to the of content of LCP in the maternal diet. Mothers reporting a high fish consumption showed significant amounts of C22:6, omega 3 and C20:5, omega 3 fatty acids. As a general conclusion, breast milk produced by a well nourished mother is better suited to meet the lipid requirements of infants.","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

The odor potency was assessed by values of best estimate-GC-lower amount detected by sniffing (BE-GC-LOADS). For small and medium chain S-methyl thioesters, these values were found to increase from 6 ng for S-methyl thiobutanoate to 90 ng for S-methyl thiostearate. All assessors detected a ""green"", ""floral"", or ""pineapple"" odor for S-methyl thiohexanoate and described thioesters containing a 2-6 carbon chain length as ""cheesy"". The results of this preliminary analysis were confirmed by a more extensive study of selected compounds, namely S-methyl thioacetate, S-methyl thiopropionate, S-methyl thiobutanoate, and S-methyl thiohexanoate, using a trained panel of 18 subjects. The subjects confirmed the presence of the ""green"" and ""fruity"" notes in the odor of S-methyl thiohexanoate. The analysis also revealed a significant difference in the odor of S-methyl thiopropionate relative to that of S-methyl thioacetate and S-methyl thiobutanoate.

For this purpose an electrothermal atomic absorption (ET-AAS) method for determining cadmium and lead in these products was studied. The ET-AAS instrumental conditions and temperature/time furnace program were selected. The analytical parameters of the method (linearity, detection and quantification limits and precision) show its usefulness in measuring cadmium and lead in infant cereal products. The method was applied to eight different types of infant cereals from four different manufacturers, in all 29 different infant cereal products commercially available in Spain. The cadmium and lead contents of milk-free infant cereals range from 6.6 to 35.8 ng/g and from 36.1 to 305.6 ng/g, respectively, while the ranges corresponding to milk-added infant cereals are 2.9-40.0 ng/g for cadmium and 53.5-598.3 ng/g for lead. The cadmium and lead contents of cereal products of the same type from different manufacturers is responsible for the large confidence intervals and made it impossible to detect significant differences among the different products.

This study investigated the postprandial plasma amino acid profiles of preterm infants fed with different dietary proteins at similar protein intakes during the first weeks of life. In 12 preterm infants, pre- and postprandial plasma amino acid concentrations were measured before the removal of an indwelling central venous catheter placed for parenteral nutrition. All infants received breast milk until the time of study. At the start day of the study, infants were randomized to receive a test meal of 10 ml/kg, either of breast milk fortified with breast milk protein to reach a protein content of 2.0 g/dl or of a bovine milk preterm formula with a protein content of 2.0 g/dl (whey/casein ratio 60/40). Five samples of 100 microl blood were obtained immediately before and 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after the test meal. The plasma amino acid analysis was performed by a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography based on o-phthaldialdehyde/2-mercaptoethanol pre-column derivatization. In both groups, the plasma amino acid concentrations increased within the first 30 min and the levels did not return to the preprandial baseline during the observation period. Fifteen minutes after the test meal, the plasma levels of all essential amino acids with the exception of histidine were higher in the bovine milk formula fed infants than in the fortified breast milk fed infants. The sum of plasma essential amino acid levels found in the formula fed infants were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the levels found in the fortified breast milk fed infants at 15, 30 and 45 min. The kinetics of individual amino acids were influenced by the different quality of the protein even when the intakes in the groups were similar, as demonstrated for histidine and phenylalanine. The data indicate that postprandial plasma amino acid concentrations depend significantly on the dietary amino acid source and cannot simply be calculated from the amino acid composition of dietary proteins. Therefore, postprandial plasma amino acid concentrations should be included in the nutritional evaluation of dietary proteins in preterm infants.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)","['D000596', 'D000818', 'D001942', 'D004044', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007225', 'D007231', 'D007234', 'D008892', 'D008895', 'D009753', 'D010288']","['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Breast Feeding', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Food', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Milk', 'Milk, Human', 'Nutritive Value', 'Parenteral Nutrition']",Postprandial plasma amino acids in preterm infants: influence of the protein source.,"['Q000097', None, None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None]","['blood', None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'blood', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10503690,1999

The present work investigates the kinetics delivery of CMP in human jejunal lumen during the digestion of intrinsically [15N]-labelled casein, whey protein, yoghurt and pea flour meal. Effluents were collected through a nasointestinal tube and analysed for the enrichment in [15N] to evaluate the dietary nitrogen fraction. Detection and quantification of CMP was performed by an inhibition Elisa procedure. No trace of CMP was detected in the ileum of volunteers after the ingestion of the casein meal. The results showed that CMP appears in the jejunal effluents within the first 20 min after meal ingestion at a level varying from meal to meal. During digestion of whey protein, CMP appeared rapidly as a single peak and in high amounts, whereas it is discharged slowly in moderate proportions with the casein meal. These results demonstrate that CMP is emptied from the stomach in significant amounts during milk products digestion and support the hypothesis that food-born peptides could exert a physiological function.

Sprague-Dawley dams at parturition were fed semipurified diets containing decreasing ratios of 18:2n-6 to 18:3n-3 from 21.6:1 to 1:1. During the first 2 weeks of life, the rat pups received only their dam's milk. The fatty acid composition of the pups stomach contents (dam's milk) and the phospholipids from neuronal cells were identified and quantitated by gas-liquid chromatography. The stomach 22:6n-3 content analyzed from the rat pups at 2 weeks of age was altered by the maternal diet. Fatty acid analysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS) in neuronal cells of the rat pups showed no significant increase in 22:6n-3 content with increasing 18:3n-3 in the maternal diet (p > 0.05).

10367004,"The fat content and fatty acid (FA) composition of nearly 40 foods, currently consumed by 102 nursing Congolese mothers living in Brazzaville, were determined to assess their impact on mothers' essential fatty acid (EFA) intakes and breast milk FA. Data on mothers' milk FA and dietary habits which allowed food selection were recently published (Rocquelin et al., 1998). Most foods were locally produced. Food samples were collected at local markets, bleached if necessary to avoid microbial degradation, and stored at +4 degrees C or -20 degrees C. They were lyophilized upon their arrival in the laboratory before lipid analyses. FA composition of food lipids was determined by capillary gas chromatography. Staple diets included low-fat, high-carbohydrate foods (processed cassava roots, wheat bread) and high-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) foods: soybean oil (high in 18 : 2 n-6 and alpha-18 : 3 n-3), bushbutter (dacryodes edulis), peanuts, avocado (high in fat and 18 : 2 n-6), freshwater and salt-water fish (high in LC n-3 and/or n-6 PUFA), and leafy green vegetables (low in fat but very high in alpha-18 : 3 n-3). Their frequent consumption by nursing mothers provided enough EFA to meet requirements due to lactation. It also explains why mothers' breast milk was rich in C8-C14 saturated FA (26% of total FA) and in n-6, n-3 PUFA (respectively 15.0% and 2.4% of total FA) highly profitable for breastfed infants' development.

10211191,"2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane bis(2,3-epoxypropyl) ether (BADGE) is used in the manufacture of lacquers for coating the inside of food and beverage cans. In June 1996 the EC Scientific Committee for Food temporarily increased the specific migration limit applying to BADGE to 1 mg/kg pending consideration of additional toxicological data. In order to find out if there is migration of BADGE from can coatings into foods, a 'worst case' sampling exercise has been conducted to survey those canned foods where the propensity for migration of BADGE was judged to be highest. The foods surveyed include canned fish in oil, meat and milk and, altogether, BADGE was determined in 181 retail samples. Analysis for BADGE was conducted, in duplicate, by HPLC with fluorescence detection with confirmation of BADGE identity by GC/MS analysis using selected ion monitoring. BADGE was found at levels exceeding 1 mg/kg in seven of the 15 canned anchovy samples and five of the 22 sardine samples purchased during the period September 1995-July 1996. Infrared analysis of the can coatings provided strong evidence that the higher BADGE levels found were associated with use of PVC organosol lacquers, although in some cases cans coated with organosols gave low BADGE results. For canned sardine samples found to contain greater than 0.5 mg/kg BADGE in the total contents, a replicate can was opened and separate analyses performed on the drained fish and the oil. The results clearly showed that BADGE concentrations in the oil were about 20 times higher than in the drained fish. Further samples of canned sardines and anchovies were purchased in June/July 1997 and, in all cases, BADGE levels were found to be below 1 mg/kg. In the other retail canned foods, BADGE was not detectable (DL = 0.02 mg/kg) or detected at concentrations well below the temporary SML of 1 mg/kg.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000818', 'D001559', 'D002273', 'D002851', 'D004852', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D018857', 'D005519', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D008460', 'D011785']","['Animals', 'Benzhydryl Compounds', 'Carcinogens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Epoxy Compounds', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Packaging', 'Food Preservation', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Meat', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care']",Survey of bisphenol a diglycidyl ether (BADGE) in canned foods.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10211191,1999

One group of infants received a formula with a linoleic:alpha-linolenic acid ratio of 10:1 (MF group). Another group served as control and received their own mother's milk (HM group). Blood samples were taken at birth and at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months of life. Plasma and RBC fatty acid composition were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography and results of total plasma lipids were expressed as concentrations by adding an internal standard. Concentrations of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids increased in total plasma lipids with age in all infants. In contrast, those fatty acids decreased when results were expressed as percentages of total fatty acids. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) decreased regardless of how results were expressed, but the absolute concentrations of these fatty acids in plasma available for tissue accretion were greater than suggested by the percentage results. Plasma and RBC docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) decreased in the MF group in comparison to the HM group. Arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) was lower in plasma of MF-fed infant but not in RBC phospholipids. We conclude that term SGA infants fed an adapted milk formula with a linoleic:alpha-linolenic acid ratio of 10:1 but devoid of LCP may lead to a low n-3 LCP status.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","['D004912', 'D005227', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007225', 'D007227', 'D007231', 'D007236', 'D008895', 'D010949']","['Erythrocytes', 'Fatty Acids', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Food', 'Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Small for Gestational Age', 'Milk, Human', 'Plasma']",Plasma and red blood cell fatty acid composition in small for gestational age term infants fed human milk or formula.,"['Q000737', 'Q000097', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'blood', None, None, None, None, None, 'blood', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10205336,1999

10028681,"Niacin content must be included on food labels of infant formula products and bakery products containing enriched flour. Liquid chromatographic (LC) determination of niacin in complex food matrixes is complicated by the presence of endogenous compounds that absorb at the commonly used wave-length of 260 nm. Also, the presence of particulate matter in the standard sulfuric acid extraction procedure results in reduced life of LC columns and precolumns. A simple, rapid, solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure for separation and cleanup of niacin from a complex food matrix digest has been developed. By using a vacuum manifold with the SPE column system, multiple samples can be processed quickly and efficiently for LC analysis, compared with gravimetric column cleanup. Sulfuric acid sample digest is passed over an aromatic sulfonic acid cation-exchange (ArSCX-SPE) or a sulfonated Florisil SPE column. Niacin is eluted with 0.25M sodium acetate-acetic acid, pH 5.6 buffer in vacuo. LC chromatograms of the resulting eluate are free of interference from other components absorbing at 260 nm at the retention time of niacin. Validation of the method was obtained from agreement of analytical results on available reference materials. For both SPE methods, values for niacin in SRM 1846 Infant Formula (milk-based powder) were within uncertainty ranges of the certified value. Use of several calibration procedures (the LC computer program, a peak area response graphic standard curve, or the method of standard additions) with both SPE procedures resulted in niacin values for 3 RM-Wheat Flours (not certified for niacin) in agreement (90-105%) with their respective values reported in the literature. Several commercial wheat flours showed a broad 260 nm interference, resulting in high niacin values. Niacin recoveries from spiked soy-based liquid infant formulas ranged from 95-107% with the ArSCX-SPE column.

10028680,"A liquid chromatographic (LC) method was elaborated for determining folates in foods. Folates were extracted by homogenizing in buffer and heat treatment. A portion was incubated with an enzyme preparation containing conjugase, amylase, and protease. After purification by affinity chromatography, folate monoglutamates were determined by reversed-phase LC with fluorescence and diode array detection. Gradient elution with phosphate buffer and acetonitrile was used to separate vitamers. The most abundant folate forms naturally present in foods were detected, including tetrahydrofolic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid. 10-Formylfolic acid could be detected by applying a second fluorescence detector. Folic acid, used for fortification, might also be quantitated with this system. The difference between folate concentrations in sample extracts, with and without treatment of conjugase, is a measure of the quantity of polyglutamates in the food matrixes. An additional treatment with conjugase, amylase, and protease reflects the amount of matrix-bound folates. The LC system gave a linear response over the range 0-100 ng/mL. Detection limit for these compounds were 7 pg/mL for tetrahydrofolic acid and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid and 59 pg/mL for 10-formylfolic acid (signal-to-noise ratio > or = 3) when 100 microL was injected.

Concentrations of endospores of lactate-fermenting, gas-producing Clostridium spp. were between 5.0 x 10(-2) and 1.7 x 10(0) MPN ml(-1). Concentrations of presumptive C. tyrobutyricum endospores (defined by subterminal endospore position and lactate dehydrogenase activity) were lower, not exceeding 2.0 x 10(-2) MPN ml(-1). Based on subterminal endospore position, lactate dehydrogenase activity, and a carbohydrate fermentation profile identical to C. tyrobutyricum strain ATCC 25755, five isolates (Ct) were initially characterized as C. tyrobutyricum, a known cause of late-blowing in high-pH cheeses. Twenty-eight other isolates (Cx) produced gas from lactate, but differed from ATCC 25755 in either endospore position, lactate dehydrogenase activity or carbohydrate fermentation profile. When inoculated at high concentrations in Gouda cheese, strain ATCC 25755, two Ct isolates and 18 Cx isolates tested produced gas during ripening. Among the five Ct isolates obtained and two reference strains confirmed as C. tyrobutyricum, there were four qualitatively different volatile organic acid byproduct profiles. Each of the two confirmed C. tyrobutyricum reference strains and five Ct isolates had distinct quantitative cell membrane fatty acid (CMFA) profiles. The Cx isolates represented 14 different volatile organic acid byproduct profiles and each isolate had a unique CMFA profile.

Acid-hydrolyzed samples are subjected to solid phase extraction; then they are dried and redissolved before injection. The electrophoresis separation is performed in a fused silica capillary tube (50 microns inside diameter) with an extended-path-length detection cell using a 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid solution at pH 7.0 as run buffer. The in-laboratory repeatability was within +/- 7.1% at the 95% confidence level when the amount of furosine ranged between 8 and 250 mg per 100 g protein. The values of both repeatability and sensitivity fulfill the requirements stated in the EU and Italian regulations for furosine determination in pasteurized milk and Mozzarella cheese. The data obtained on 48 different food samples including heat-treated milk, cheeses, and durum wheat products were comparable with those obtained by an HPLC method and proved to be accurate for furosine values up to at least 400 mg per 100 g protein.

Food protein value can be adversely affected by these reactions, and in particular lysine, an essential amino acid having on its side chain a free amino group, can be converted to nonbioavailable N-substituted lysine or blocked lysine. by acid hydrolysis of epsilon-deoxyketosyl compounds, furosine is formed. In this paper furosine prepared from milk-based commercial products has been evaluated by use of a recently developed HPLC method using a microbore column and phosphate buffer as the mobile phase at controlled temperature. Furosine levels have been used, together with protein, total amino acids, and lysine content, as an estimate of protein quality of a few different products such as cooked-cream dessert, yogurt mousse, white chocolate, milk chocolate, milk chocolate with a soft nougat and caramel center, milk chocolate with a whipped white center, chocolate spread, part-skim milk tablets, milk-based dietetic meals, and baby foods. The protein content of the analyzed products ranged from 34.3 gxkg(-1) (milk nougat) to 188.4 g x kg(-1) (milk tablets).

9635883,"2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is a mammary carcinogen in female rats and is present in a wide variety of cooked meats. We address here the excretion of PhIP and its metabolites into the breast-milk of lactating rats and the ability of chlorophyllin, a food product derivative with chemopreventive properties, to affect these levels at low PhIP doses. Lactating female F344 rats with suckling pups were orally administered 50, 500 and 1000 ng [14C]PhIP/kg body weight. The excretion of the [14C]PhIP into milk and its distribution among the mammary tissue, liver and blood of the dam, as well as among stomach contents and liver of their suckling pups was measured using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). PhIP, PhIP-4'-sulfate, 4'-hydroxy-PhIP, and N2-hydroxy-PhIP-N3-glucuronide were found in the milk at all doses. The chlorophyllin (500 microg/kg) co-administration with PhIP (500 ng/kg) caused increased levels of [14C]PhIP in the milk (32%) and stomach contents (35%) of the pups relative to the animals not receiving chlorophyllin at these low PhIP doses. In contrast, lower [14C]PhIP levels in the chlorophyllin treated animals were observed in the blood (47%) and mammary tissue (68%) of the dam, as well as the pup's liver tissue (37%) compared to the animals receiving only PhIP. Chlorophyllin co-administration resulted in an increased amount of N2-hydroxy-PhIP-N3-glucuronide (42%), increased PhIP (79%) and decreased levels of PhIP-4'-sulphate (77%) relative to the animals not receiving chlorophyllin. These results suggest that PhIP and PhIP metabolites are present in the breast-milk of lactating rats at human dietary PhIP exposures and that PhIP is absorbed by the newborn.

For comparison, 9 formula milk samples (reconstituted with Hg-free water) were investigated. The Hg-M in the human milk samples ranged from < 0.2 to 6.86 micrograms/L (median 0.37), in the formula milk samples from 0.4 to 2.5 micrograms/L (median 0.76). The Hg-M in the breast milk samples correlates positively with the number of maternal teeth with dental amalgam. The mean Hg-M of amalgam-free mothers was < 0.2 microgram/L, while milk from mothers with 1-4 amalgam fillings contained 0.57 microgram/L, with 5-7 fillings 0.50 microgram/L and with more than 7 fillings 2.11 micrograms/L. Hg-M correlated negatively to the day after delivery. Frequency of fish consumption tends to influence Hg-M positively, while the age of the mother shows no significant correlation. In the first 2 to 3 days after delivery some colostrum samples with Hg-M higher than in formula milk were found. Later on, the Hg-concentration in the breast milk was equal or even lower to that in formula milk. The higher Hg burden of infants' tissues from mothers with dental amalgam, as reported previously, must be explained (1) by a prenatal transfer of Hg from the mother's fillings through the placenta to the fetus, followed by a redistribution of this Hg in the body of the newborn, and (2) an additional burden via breast milk. Nevertheless, the comparison of Hg-M in breast and formula milk, the relatively moderate Hg burden in both kinds of milk, and the multiple manifest advantages of breast feeding speak against any limitation of nursing, even for mothers with a large number of dental amalgam fillings.",Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),"['D000328', 'D000818', 'D003126', 'D003723', 'D004032', 'D005260', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D007225', 'D007774', 'D008628', 'D008895', 'D013054']","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Colostrum', 'Dental Amalgam', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Lactation', 'Mercury', 'Milk, Human', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",Mercury in human colostrum and early breast milk.

Pasteurized milks with mild heat treatment (high quality milk) had an average 13-cis: all-trans ratio of 2.6%, while pasteurized milk treated for 15 s at temperatures ranging from 72 to 76 degrees C had an average ratio of 6.4%. Milk subjected to more severe heat treatments had a higher degree of isomerization (UHT milk, 15.7%; sterilized milk, 33.5%), consistent with increased thermal conversion of the retinol isomers. In pasteurized and UHT cream, the increase in 13-cis-isomer was also a consequence of heat treatment (pasteurized cream, 3.0%; UHT cream, 14.4%). The presence of cis isomers in fermented milk suggests that fermentation processes, directly or indirectly, can induce cis-trans isomerization.

Objectives of this study were to examine the concentration of mercury in human breast milk and the confounders which may modify the mercury levels. Women who gave birth between August 1995 and May 1996 in a district hospital were asked to participate in the study. The examination included a standardized anamnesis and an inspection of the teeth by an dentist. Blood and urine samples of 147 women and breast milk samples of 118 women were collected in the first week after birth. After 2 months of breast feeding a second breast milk sample was collected from 85 of women. Mercury was measured by cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry. The concentration of mercury in the breast milk collected immediately after birth showed a significant association with the number of amalgam fillings as well as with the frequency of meals. Urine mercury concentrations correlated with the number of amalgam fillings and amalgam surfaces. In the breast milk after 2 months of lactation, the concentrations were lower (mean: <0.25 microg/L; range <0.25-11.7 microg/L) compared with the first sample (mean: 0.90 microg/L; range <0.25-20. 3 microg/L) and were positively associated with the fish consumption but no longer with the number of the amalgam fillings.

9489745,"To determine the transport and utilization of dietary saturated, monounsaturated, and n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for the developing brain and other organs, artificially reared rat pups were fed a rat milk substitute containing the perdeuterated (each 97 atom% deuterium) fatty acids, i.e., palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic, from day 7 after birth to day 14 as previously described. Fatty acids in lipid extracts of the liver, lung, kidney, and brain were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine their content of each of the deuterated fatty acids. The uptake and metabolism of perdeuterated fatty acid lead to the appearance of three distinct groups of isotopomers: the intact perdeuterated, the newly synthesized (with recycled deuterium), and the natural unlabeled fatty acid. The quantification of these isotopomers permits the estimation of uptake and de novo synthesis of these fatty acids. Intact perdeuterated palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids from the diet were found in liver, lung, and kidney, but not in brain. By contrast, perdeuterated linoleic acid was found in all these organs. Isotopomers of fatty acid from de novo synthesis were observed in palmitic, oleic, and stearic acids in all tissues. The highest enrichment of isotopomers with recycled deuterium was found in the brain. The data indicate that, during the brain growth spurt and the prelude to myelination, the major saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in brain lipids are exclusively produced locally by de novo biosynthesis. Consequently, the n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids must be transported and delivered to the brain by highly specific mechanisms.",Journal of neurochemistry,"['D000818', 'D000831', 'D001692', 'D001812', 'D001835', 'D001921', 'D003903', 'D005227', 'D005231', 'D005260', 'D009186', 'D019301', 'D019308', 'D011247', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D013229']","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Biological Transport', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Body Weight', 'Brain', 'Deuterium', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Female', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Oleic Acid', 'Palmitic Acid', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Stearic Acids']",Fatty acid transport and utilization for the developing brain.,"[None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000254', None, 'Q000096', 'Q000096', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000096', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'physiology', 'physiology', None, 'growth & development', None, 'biosynthesis', 'biosynthesis', None, 'metabolism', 'biosynthesis', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9489745,1998

Safrole concentration in these spices was 9,325, 3,432, 955 and 500 mg.kg-1, respectively. Black pepper was chosen to use in the following experiments. Using Ames-test with Salmonella TA 98 and TA 100 proved high cytotoxic effects due to pure safrole and black pepper volatile oil in both of them. The degradation of safrole was obvious after drying of the washed seeds of black pepper especially at 70 degrees C for 30 min or with sun-drying. Also, high irradiation doses (20 and 30 kGy) caused high degradation of more than 90% of the initial toxic concentration in black pepper. Whereas, microwave caused same effects at 75 s, but unfortunately, the powder was burned due to moisture absence. Boiling whole seeds or powder of black pepper during cooking for few minutes (1-5 min) were more efficient in decreasing safrole content. Finally, these results proved that the mutagenicity of some spices due to presence of safrole can be destructed during drying of the washed seeds or during cooking either with or without any additional treatment as irradiation.

It is not known whether lactose-intolerant subjects should consume full-fat or high energy milk instead of half-skimmed milk. In this study, breath 13CO2 and hydrogen (H2) measurements were combined to assess simultaneously the effect of increasing milk energy content on gastric emptying, digestion, and tolerance of lactose. On two separate days, 11 adult lactose maldigesters ingested, in the fasting state, a single dose of 710 kJ half-skimmed milk or 1970 kJ high energy milk. Both contained 18 g lactose and were supplemented with 100 mg 13C-glycine for breath 13CO2 measurement. For 6 h after milk ingestion, samples of expired breath were collected, and subjects scored their symptoms on a four-grade questionnaire. Gastric emptying was measured from excretion of breath 13CO2. The mean gastric emptying half-time was significantly longer after ingestion of high energy milk than after half-skimmed milk (84 +/- 4 vs. 64 +/- 4 min, P = 0.004). The mean area under the breath H2 excretion curve measured for 6 h was 330 +/- 61 microL/L after subjects consumed high energy milk vs. 470 +/- 82 microL/L after they consumed half-skimmed milk (P = 0.07). Mean symptom scores did not differ after ingestion of the two milks, but only two subjects experienced disturbing symptoms after high energy milk ingestion compared with five subjects after ingestion of half-skimmed milk (P = 0.56). Although ingestion of high energy milk delayed the gastric emptying of lactose for significantly longer than the ingestion of half-skimmed milk (P < 0.01), it did not lead to significant improvement in symptoms and reflected only a trend toward improved lactose digestion (P = 0.07), as measured by the area under the breath H2 excretion curve.

Biogenic amines were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography following extraction from the cheese and derivatization with dansyl chloride. Levels of histamine, potentially the most toxic amine, in the semihard Idiazábal cheese were very low. Tyramine, putrescine, and cadaverine were the main amines present in this type of cheese. Levels of those amines increased during ripening. Pasteurization of the milk brought about a reduction in the biogenic amine content of the ripened cheese, irrespective of the starter culture employed.

In the first part of the study, colostrum obtained from 36 normal delivery women and six kinds of infant formulas provided by three major milk companies were analyzed for their fatty acid composition using capillary gas-lipid chromatography. Although enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the percent composition of DHA in the six infant formulas (0.15-0.21%) was significantly lower than that in the colostrum (1.1 +/- 0.54). Arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were present in the colostrum but not detectable in the infant formulas.

Milk plays an important part in the food chain in many Western countries today. Several studies suggest that folate-binding proteins might have an impact on folate absorption and therefore their concentrations are also important.

All results were corrected for recovery by spiking the samples with 5-CH3THF. Effects of storage of dairy products on 5-CH3THF concentrations were also investigated; generally small and insignificant fluctuations were found, except for hard cheese, in which 5-CH3THF decreased significantly. There was a significant seasonal variation in the folate concentration of pasteurized milk which peaked in the summer months.

In our study, mature human milk contained more phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine than choline, phosphatidylcholine, or sphingomyelin (P < 0.01). Previous studies have not recognized that phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine exist in human milk. Concentrations of choline compounds in mature milk of mothers giving birth to preterm or full-term infants were not significantly different. Infant formulas also contained choline and choline-containing compounds. In infant formulas derived from soy or bovine milk, unesterified choline, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin concentrations varied greatly. All infant formulas contained significantly less phosphocholine than did human milk. Soy-derived formulas contained significantly less glycerophosphocholine (P < 0.01) and phosphocholine (P < 0.01) and more phosphatidylcholine (P < 0.01) than did human or bovine milk or bovine milk-derived infant formulas. Rat milk contained greater amounts of glycerophosphocholine (almost 75% of the total choline moiety in milk) and phosphocholine than did human milk. When dams were provided with either a control, choline-deficient, or choline-supplemented diet, milk composition reflected the choline content of the diet. Because there are competing demands for choline in neonates, it is important to ensure adequate availability through proper infant nutrition.

The amount of folate-binding protein (FBP) was analysed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Unprocessed milk and pasteurised milk were found to contain similar amounts, 211 and 168 nmol/l, of FBP, respectively. UHT-processed milk and Yoghurt naturelle, both processed at temperatures above 90 degrees C, contained only 5.2 and 0.2 nmol/l FBP, respectively. As an indication of the protein-binding capacity free and protein-bound folates were analysed after charcoal treatment using the radio-protein binding assay method (RPBA). These results indicated that all folates in unprocessed milk and pasteurised milk were protein-bound, while folates in UHT-processed milk and Yoghurt naturelle occurred freely which is supported by our findings on FBP. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that unprocessed milk, pasteurised milk, UHT-processed milk and Yoghurt naturelle contained 44.8 +/- 2.1 (n = 10), 41.1 +/- 0.9 (n = 10), 36.1 +/- 1.8 (n = 10) and 35.6 +/- 9.1 micrograms/l (n = 10) 5-methyltetrahydrofolates (5-CH3THF), respectively, after deconjugation.

Hence, both methods indicated significant (P < 0.05) losses of 5-CH3THF as a result of pasteurisation, UHT processing and fermentation, compared with unprocessed milk. In spite of apparent discrepancies in folate concentrations obtained using the two different methods, these results support the equimolar ratio of FBP and folates in unprocessed and pasteurised milk when data on 5-CH3THF, obtained using HPLC were corrected for differences in recovery. Thus, heat processing of milk not only reduced the amount of 5-CH3 THF significantly, but also changed the concentration of FBP and the folate-binding capacity of FBP, which may have implications on the bioavailability of milk folates.",International journal of food sciences and nutrition,"['D000818', 'D002352', 'D002606', 'D002851', 'D005285', 'D058973', 'D005492', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D011956', 'D013763', 'D015014']","['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Charcoal', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fermentation', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Tetrahydrofolates', 'Yogurt']","Effect of milk processing on the concentration of folate-binding protein (FBP), folate-binding capacity and retention of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.","[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8844253,1996
8653383,"Samples of unpasteurised bulked milk, taken directly from ten herds of dairy cattle on rural and urban farms in the north west of England on five separate sampling occasions, were analysed for a range of PCB congeners. Sigma PCB concentrations (sum of 37 congeners) ranged from 3.4-16.4 ng/g milk fat with a mean sigma PCB concentration of 8.4 ng/g milk fat. The dominating congeners were 118, 153, 138 and 180, which contributed 15%, 20%, 17% and 9% of the sigma PCB load respectively. The chlorine pattern of the congeners which made moderate or major contributions to the sigma PCB concentration were typically substituted at both para positions (4,4'), while the PCB congeners not detected in the milk had at least one ring that was not 4-substituted. These results indicate the 4,4' substitution pattern as being the key to PCB persistence in cows. It is estimated that consumption of typical daily intakes of milk with the PCB concentrations measured in this study would contribute 11% of the average daily sigma PCB intake for individuals in the UK. This contribution would increase to 30% when exposure through the consumption of dairy products prepared from such milk (e.g. cheese, butter) is taken into account.

Levels of genistein and its beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 mg/person, respectively.

8849040,"The applicability of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to the purification in foodstuffs in the detection of three classes of drugs, sulfonamides, nitrofurans, and growth promoters, is described. This technique has already found a wide application in the routine analysis of pesticides in milk, eggs and grease but to our knowledge there is no published work on the use of GPC for purifying animal feedstuffs for the detection of the above-mentioned classes of drugs. Three main advantages characterize this method: the simultaneous determination of a wide spectrum of drugs; good performance of the purification system; and high recoveries. The method was tested for a determination limit of 1 ppm in each compound. Average recoveries of spiked samples were: 99% for sulfonamides; 98% for nitrofurans; and 100% for carbadox [methyl-3-(2-quinoxalinylmethylene) carbazate-1,4-dioxide] and olaquindox [N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methyl-2-quinoxalinecarboxamide-1,4-dioxide] .

8620102,"Pesticide residues in human milk and environmental samples from Kafr El-Zayat Governorate in Egypt were analyzed. This governorate is located near one of the biggest pesticide factories in Egypt. Organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides were monitored, including those that have been prohibited from use in Egypt. Human milk samples (31 samples) from Kafr El-Zayat were compared with 11 samples collected from Cairo. Data were compared with results from studies performed in 1987 and 1990. The present study showed that aldrin and dieldrin, heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide, and endrin residues have been eliminated from human milk. Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of DDT complex and gamma-HCH by breast-fed infants in Kafr El-Zayat were 85.96 and 3.1% of the respective acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). beta-HCH residues showed an increasing pattern, especially in human milk samples from Cairo. DDT complex and HCH isomers in orange, spinach, lettuce, potatoes, and clover samples ranged from undetectable to very low concentrations. Higher levels of DDT and HCH were detected, but aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, and the heptachlors were not detected in food of animal origin. Residues in fish samples were below maximum residue limits established by some developed countries. Those in animal milk samples approached the extraneous residue limits of the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues. HCH residues in soil were negligible, but DDT residues in soil were somewhat higher. Among water samples, groundwater samples had the highest residues of HCHs and DDTs, followed by Nile River water and then tap water. However, the organochlorine pesticide residues were found at concentrations below the maximum allowable limits set by the World Health Organization for drinking water. Among 12 organophosphorus pesticides monitored as parent compounds, dimethoate, malathion, methamidophos, and chlorpyrifos residues were detected in low concentrations in soil samples from a pesticide factory. No organophosphorus pesticide residues were found in plant samples, except for very low residues of dimethoate in an orange sample.

8546886,"In the past few years, there has been an upsurge of interest in aluminum (Al) and human health. The well-recognized manifestations of systemic Al toxicity include fracturing osteomalacia, dialysis encephalopathy, and microcytic hypochromic anemia. The role of Al in causing childhood diseases is also becoming clearer, but the safe plasma level still remains to be determined in newborns, especially in premature newborns, implying that it should be kept low. Premature infants receiving iv fluid therapy show evidence of Al loading. Additionally, the infant-feeding mixtures, especially the soy-based infant formulas, tested may be a significant additional source of Al in the diet of infants with low birthweights, and in infants and in young children with impaired renal function. Careful clinical and biochemical monitoring is warranted to determine whether it will be necessary to eliminate Al contamination of both oral and parenteral preparations used in infants and children who may be at risk for Al intoxication. In this present study, the Al content of infant feeds was measured by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and also compared with those of breast milk, cow's milk, milk powder, and some starches that are commonly used for preparation of infant feed in Turkey. Our results show that Al content of commercially available powdered infant formulas, most of which are imported from Europe, ranged from 1.211 to 10.925 micrograms/g.

Barrows were treated daily with buffer or porcine somatotropin (100 micrograms/kg body wt) when they weighed between 30 and 64 kg (eight pigs/group). Pigs were restrictively fed so that the average food intake was 1.86 kg/d. The corn-soybean meal-skim milk-based diet contained 18% crude protein and 1.2% lysine, and was designed to meet muscle amino acid ratio profile with respect to lysine as the first limiting amino acid for growth. Tissue levels of eighteen amino acids were determined on lyophilized samples that were appropriately hydrolyzed and analyzed by HPLC. The concentrations (mg/g dry wt) of all amino acids were greater in carcass, skin, head and empty body of porcine somatotropin-treated pigs; amino acid concentration in viscera was not influenced by porcine somatotropin. However, when the concentration of each amino acid was expressed on a per unit protein basis, the amino acid profiles of control and porcine somatotropin-treated pigs were quite similar. The average deposition rate of each amino acid was increased approximately 67% by porcine somatotropin. When the deposition of each amino acid was calculated in relation to lysine, however, the pattern of amino acid utilization for growth was similar for control and porcine somatotropin-treated pigs; exceptions were arginine, glycine and tryptophan. The ratio of indispensable to dispensable amino acids that were deposited was also similar for control and porcine somatotropin-treated pigs.

The challenge with beta-LG in a fat emulsion further increased the level of plasma RMCPII. This manipulation, however, was not successful for detecting any significant difference in mucosal leucotriene C4, another allergic mediator. An oral challenge with polymerized beta-LG did not induce any elevation of the protease, but resulted in a lower plasma level of beta-LG-specific IgG.

Two methods were proposed for lead condensation on lanthanum carrier--in form of hydroxide or sulphide. By coprecipitation of lead on lanthanum in ammonia atmosphere lead separated and selectively condensed. Other metals (Zn, Cd, Cu) coexistent in food products remained as amino complexes in the solution. The sediment remaining after lead condensation was dissolved in 2 mol/dm3 hydrochloric acid solution. The selected conditions of lead separation and condensation make possible determination of the metal in the concentrations from 0.01 mcg/ml to 0.2 mcg/ml by the ICP-ARS and dithizone methods. The method of condensation and determination was used for lead determination in milk and dairy products in concentrations below 1.5 x 10(-5)%. The studied food products were mineralized with concentrated HNO3, H2SO4 and perhydrol.

After its use there may be residues present in ovine milk that interfere with cheese making and processing of other milk products. It is important to monitor for the presence of tilmicosin in ovine milk and a method has been optimized and validated for its determination. Tilmicosin is extracted from milk into methanol. The methanol extract is acidified and non-polar co-extractives removed using hexane followed by carbon tetrachloride. The pH is adjusted to 9.0 and the tilmicosin partitioned into chloroform. The chloroform extract is evaporated to dryness and the residue resuspended in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) mobile phase. Tilmicosin is determined using reversed-phase HPLC and ultraviolet (UV) detection at 280 nm. Recovery of tilmicosin from ovine milk fortified over the range 50 to 250 micrograms l-1 is in the range 84.3-104.8%, with a relative standard deviation ranging from 6.6 to 12.9%.

High selectivity was obtained by on-line coupling of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Gas chromatography (GC) with electron capture detection or high-resolution mass spectrometry was utilized for quantitative determinations. Group separation of different PCB congeners was achieved on a (2-(1-pyrenyl)ethyl)dimethylsilylated silica column. Compared with off-line HPLC, the on-line coupling to SFE resulted only in a minor reduction in column efficiency. The average recoveries of the planar non-ortho-substituted PCB congeners 77, 126, and 169 from crab hepatopancreas were 71-101%, with the highest recovery for PCB-169. For human blood serum and milk, the recoveries of the three congeners ranged from 35 to 57% (serum) and from 76 to 87% (milk), with the lowest recovery for PCB-169. The relative standard deviations of the complete analyses were determined to be 5-16%. The recoveries of the on-line SFE-HPLC technique were compared to those of conventional solvent extraction and off-line HPLC. For crab hepatopancreas, the two methods gave approximately the same result, but for blood serum, slightly higher recovery of the native non-ortho-substituted PCBs was obtained using SFE-HPLC.

7821234,"In the evaluation of lipophilic halocarbons for neurobehavioral toxicity in operant testing, animals often receive large amounts of milk as a behavioral reinforcer over time. If this increase of fat in the diet sufficiently impacted the lipid depots of the animal, the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic test compounds might be significantly affected and thus obscure the accompanying neurobehavioral effects. The effects of milk intake, comparable to what was consumed as behavioral reinforcer during operant behavioral sessions, on the pharmacokinetics of inhaled 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TRI) were therefore examined in the blood and nine organ tissues of mice. Male CD-1 mice were food restricted so that their body weights would be reduced to and maintained at 80% of their original, and received a single gavage dose of 1.0 ml evaporated milk daily for three weeks. A control group with similar food restrictions was dosed with the same volume of water. Inhalation exposures to 3500 ppm TRI for 100 minutes were conducted at the end of the treatment period. Blood and nine organ tissues were sampled at a series of time points, and their TRI contents were analyzed by headspace gas chromatography. The uptake of TRI was rapid, with near steady state approached in blood and most tissues after 40-60 minutes of exposure. All of the tissues except fat had similar TRI time-concentration profiles, while TRI concentrations in fat tissue were about 20-30 times higher than in other tissues. There was no statistically significant difference in the tissue concentrations between the milk-dosed group and water-dosed group at all of the time points for all tissues measured.

The samples were analyzed for PCBs and other contaminants, including polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (p,p'-DDT + p,p'-DDE) via packed column gas chromatography. The PCBs were quantified, using the Webb-McCall method, with Aroclors 1016 and 1260 used as reference standards. Approximately 42% of the children had serum PCB levels above the detection limit of 3.0 ng/ml. The values ranged from 3.1 to 23.3 ng/ml, with a mean of 6.8 ng/ml. In contrast, PCBs were detected in 86% of the mothers. The mean serum concentration was somewhat higher for the mothers (9.6 ng/ml), but the range was similar to that found for the children. PBBs were not detected in any of the children, but were present in trace amounts in 25% of the mothers. Conversely, DDT was present in 66% of the children and 93% of the mothers. As with PCBs, DDT concentrations were somewhat higher in the mothers. DDE accounted for 89% of the total DDT in serum. Various potential sources of exposure were evaluated as possible determinants of serum PCB levels, using hierarchical multiple regression. Years of residence on a silo farm and consumption of PCB-contaminated Great Lakes fish both accounted for significant portions of the variance in maternal serum PCB levels. Exposure via breast-feeding explained a large and highly significant proportion of the variance in the children's serum PCB concentrations, suggesting that breast milk was the primary source of PCB exposure for these children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Archives of environmental health,"['D000293', 'D000328', 'D000383', 'D000818', 'D002648', 'D004032', 'D004781', 'D005260', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D008824', 'D008875', 'D008895', 'D009035', 'D011078', 'D012044']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Diet', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Michigan', 'Middle Aged', 'Milk, Human', 'Mothers', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Regression Analysis']",Determinants of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the sera of mothers and children from Michigan farms with PCB-contaminated silos.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000097', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'blood', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7818287,1995

The sulfonamides are extracted with chloroform-acetone, the organic phase is evaporated, the residues are dissolved in an aqueous potassium phosphate solution, and the fatty residues are removed by washing with hexane. The aqueous layer is collected, filtered, and injected onto an LC system, and the analyte is detected by ultraviolet (UV) absorption at 265 nm. To quantitate all 8 sulfonamides isocratically, 2 chromatographic conditions are required: 12% methanol in the mobile phase for 5 sulfonamides, and 30% methanol in the mobile phase for 4 sulfonamides. Sulfamethazine (SMZ), the most widely used sulfonamide, is detected by both systems. Collaborators were instructed to analyze 3 replicates each of control milk and control milk fortified at 3 levels. They were also provided with 20 blind incurred samples (10 samples in duplicate) to analyze. For 10 ppb fortified milk, the average interlaboratory recovery for the 8 sulfonamides ranged from 56.2% for sulfaquinoxaline (SQX) to 82.7% for SMZ in the 12% methanol mobile phase (SMZ12).

The time required to metabolize the dose of ethanol was approximately two hours shorter after the subjects had eaten breakfast. These results suggest that food in the stomach before drinking not only leads to a lowering of the peak BAC and diminishes the feelings of intoxication, but also boosts the rate of ethanol metabolism. A food-induced increase in the rate of disposal of ethanol was also confirmed when subjects ate a meal 5 h after drinking, that is, when the postabsorptive phase of ethanol metabolism was well established.

Commercial immunoassay kits from 3 manufacturers were evaluated for the detection of alachlor in cow milk and urine, and one kit was chosen for assay of chicken eggs and livers. Milk and urine were analyzed after a 1:2 dilution in water, and a rapid extraction procedure was developed for eggs and liver samples. Assays of incurred samples were performed after dosing a cow and several chickens with alachlor. Alachlor was detected in milk and eggs, but not in livers from hens dosed up to 12 mg/kg body weight. The ELISA detection limits were 0.3 ng/mL in milk, 2 ng/g in eggs, and 3 ng/g in liver.

Preliminary results from the area have suggested low selenium intakes and the possible occurrence of cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease) in the population. A low selenium concentration in foods grown locally was found: mean selenium concentration in wheat grains was 1, 5, and 28 micrograms/kg, respectively, in three villages studied, that of oats was between 3-6 micrograms/kg, and of cow's milk 10-27 micrograms/kg dry matter. The selenium concentration of bread was considerably higher, between 87-337 micrograms/kg dry wt, presumably because wheat imported from the US had been used for baking. Occasional samples of pork, beef, and mutton contained between 32-218 micrograms selenium/kg dry wt. Low selenium concentrations were observed in samples of soil and river water. The mean plasma selenium concentration of 52 persons was 1.02 mumol/L, including 33 children and 19 adult subjects. The selenium concentrations in red blood cells and toenails were 1.95 mumol/L and 0.61 mg/kg, respectively. No symptoms of heart disease caused by selenium deficiency were observed. It is concluded that the selenium status of people was fairly good thanks to the contribution to dietary intake of imported wheat with a high selenium content.

8155984,"ICP-MS is a powerful analytical technique for the determination of trace and ultra-trace elements in biological materials. Results are given of the analysis of human serum and of several biological reference materials (bovine liver, milk powder, wheat flour and pig kidney). Because concentrations of many trace metals of interest in these materials are low, dilution should be kept as limited as possible, although concentrations of certain concomitant elements (e.g. Na, K) can be high enough to cause significant suppression or enhancement of the ion signal. The result is that the dissolution procedure becomes a critical step in the analysis. Microwave digestion, wet digestion with several acids (HNO3, HClO4, HF) and simple dilution are compared with each other. In addition, three possible approaches to overcome these problems are discussed, namely the internal standardization method, the standard addition method and the isotope dilution method. Furthermore, ICP-MS is also more susceptible than initially expected to isobaric interferences arising from the plasma, the acids used in the sample preparation or the sample itself. These interferences are generally less important above a mass number of 80. Nevertheless, several researchers have investigated the possibility of removing the trace metals from the matrix or of using correction formulae based on the isotopic abundances of the elements. Some of these are evaluated. The need for identifying and quantifying chemical species, not just the elements, is well recognized. One of the reasons why elemental determination may not suffice is that different species of the same element may have a different chemical and toxicological behaviour. Arsenic (As(III), As(V)) and mercury (organomercury) are typical examples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Journal of trace elements and electrolytes in health and disease,"['D000818', 'D001774', 'D001826', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D012015', 'D012997', 'D014131']","['Animals', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Body Fluids', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Reference Standards', 'Solvents', 'Trace Elements']",A review of the capabilities of ICP-MS for trace element analysis in body fluids and tissues.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8155984,1994

8318839,"The precision parameters of the method-performance (collaborative) studies for mycotoxins published in the literature through 1991 have been recalculated on a uniform basis by following the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry protocol. About 80% of the 793 accepted assays for mycotoxins, almost all of which have been conducted by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), liquid chromatography (LC), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), exhibit relative standard deviations among laboratories (RSDR) that are less than 2 times the values predicted from the Horwitz equation: RSDR, % = 2(1-0.5log10C) where C is the concentration expressed as a decimal fraction. The precision of TLC and LC methods is about the same, but that of ELISA is somewhat poorer. For those commodities for which sufficient data exist to provide a meaningful comparison, the methods applied to cottonseed products have the best precision and corn the worst, with peanuts intermediate. Overall, however, the primary factor affecting RSDR is concentration, more or less independent of analyte, method, matrix, and age of the study. If it is assumed that the test results are normally distributed and that an RSDR of 50% is the point where effective control of the results begins to be lost (a value equivalent to the production of 2% false-negative values), then relying on the Horwitz curve, the limit of quantitative measurement is the single digit, i.e., 5, micrograms/kg (10(-9); ppb) concentration for solid food commodities. Such a value must be considered as a limit applicable to a single analyte, aflatoxin B1, and not as a mean, and not applicable to the sum of the individual components, each of whose associated standard deviation would lie in the unacceptable region. Enforcement of a 5 micrograms aflatoxin B1/kg limit, under the assumptions made, requires that a responsible manufacturer and a prudent regulator operate at opposite extremes of tolerance limits: e.g., the producer at 2 micrograms/kg and the consumer at 10. A proposed Codex ""maximum level"" of 0.05 micrograms aflatoxin M1/kg milk cannot be supported by the available data applied in an interlaboratory enforcement environment.

The ability of three of these lectins, immobilized on a variety of supports, to separate these micro-organisms from pure cultures was investigated. Immobilization of the lectins on magnetic microspheres was the most effective method. Immobilized T. vulgaris lectin bound 87-100% of cells from cultures of L. monocytogenes, 80-100% of Staph. aureus, 33-45% of Salmonella spp. and 42-77% of E. coli. The A. bisporus lectin bound 31-63% of cells in cultures of L. monocytogenes, 83% of Staph. aureus but only 3-5% of the salmonella cells. Similarly H. pomatia lectin bound greater than 92% of Staph. aureus and 64% of L. monocytogenes cells but was poor at binding the Gram-negative organisms.

During food preparation and processing phytate is partly hydrolyzed to lower inositol phosphates which have other binding properties. Zinc absorption in humans was measured in 18 women (22-37 a) by use of extrinsic labelling of meals with 65Zn and measurement of whole body retention. Inositol phosphates--400 mumol of the hexa phosphate form (IP-6), 200 and 400 mumol of the penta phosphate form (IP-5) and 400 mumol of the tetra phosphate form (IP-4)--were added to white bread and served with 200 mL of milk. The zinc content of the meal was 22 mumol. The absorption of zinc (65Zn) from white bread with no detectable phytate content was 43.3 +/- 17.9% (mean +/- SD) and from the breads with added 400 mumol of IP-6: 14.3 +/- 3.2%; 200 mumol of IP-5: 27.1 +/- 5.3%; 400 mumol of IP-5: 18.1 +/- 4.2%; and 400 mumol of IP-4: 41.5 +/- 11.3%. The results indicate that IP-6 and IP-5 have zinc-absorption depressing properties, while IP-4 added in isolated form is relatively inert as regards zinc absorption.

After the test material was homogenized and saponified with ethanolic aqueous potassium hydroxide solution, vitamin D was extracted using n-hexane. Using HPLC on a silica gel column, the fraction containing vitamin D is separated from the nonsaponifiable residue. After the fraction was reduced, the residue was dissolved in methanol and the vitamin D content determined after HPLC separation on an RP-C18 column. For evaluation, either a conventional external standard method using laboratory and matrix specific recovery rates as correction factors, or an internal standard method using vitamin D2, and D3, respectively as internal standards were employed. The method was developed and standardized by the working group ""Vitamin Analysis"" in accordance with section 35 LMBG (German Food Act). Repeatability and comparability of the results were checked in collaborative studies (14 laboratories) in milk powder and gruel that had been enriched with vitamin D3. Applicability of the method to other food (eggs, milk, fish, margarine) was checked separately. The statistical evaluation of the results of the collaborative studies has shown that the method is reliable enough to be included into the ""Amtliche Sammlung"" (official collection of analytical methods) according to section 35 LMBG.

2067565,"Consumption of trans-fatty acids increased markedly during this century due to the widespread use of partially hydrogenated fats. A sensitive analytical method was developed which enables the precise determination of 7 trans-isomers in small sample volumes. With this method we documented the materno-fetal transfer of trans-fatty acids across the human placenta. The content in human milk depends on maternal diet and is lower in Germany than in the Sudan. The distribution in fore- and hind-milk, in milk fat fractions and within the triglyceride molecule was determined. The content of trans-fatty acids is lower in commercial and home-made infant formulae than in human milk, although there is a certain batch to batch variation in formulae. Infants absorb dietary trans-isomers and incorporate them into endogenous lipids, subcutaneous tissue and cell membranes. Trans-fatty acids in plasma lipids are significantly higher in infants fed human milk than in those fed formulae. African children have a lower exposure than Germans. The relative contribution of trans-octadecenoic acid is lower in plasma sterol esters than in triglycerides and phospholipids, pointing to a negative selectivity of plasmatic cholesterol esterification with this fatty acid. Thus, a high supply of trans-octadecenoic acid might have negative effects on the cholesterol levels. In premature infants we found an inverse correlation between trans-fatty acid exposure and birthweight, thus interference with intrauterine growth appears possible. A possible causative factor could be impaired biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids by trans-isomers, for which we found strong indications.

1901733,"Adaptive changes in enzyme expression and cell proliferation occur in the small intestine of the suckling rat at the beginning of the 3rd postnatal week. This physiological adaptation can be modulated by factors including diet or glucocorticoids. We have previously described an intestinal growth-stimulating fraction derived from the remnant small bowel after resection and found that enteral nutrition is critical for its detection. In view of the similarity between the changes in cell proliferation that occur between 15 and 22 days postnatally and those immediately after resection, we sought to determine whether the small intestinal mucosa of the neonatal rat also contains a similar growth-stimulating fraction. Our results show that extracts of the proximal intestine prepared from 15-day-old rats do contain the growth-stimulating fraction. The activity was not detectable in maternal milk nor in the intestinal extract from 8-day-old rats. When the suckling rats were deprived of solid food, the activity was not detectable in the 15-day-old group. Gel filtration of the acidic extract on a G-25 Sephadex column revealed that the active component is made up of two molecular weight species (approximately 4,500 and 1,500 daltons) similar to that described in the proximal intestine of the postresectional model.

In this study, a comprehensive assessment of milk was performed to identify and quantify greater than 95% of the flavins in this food. Riboflavin and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) were the predominant flavins in all milk samples; 10-(2'-hydroxyethyl)flavin was next most common. The latter is potentially an antivitamin that may exert its effect at either the absorption or utilization level. Therefore, the presence of this analog should be considered when evaluating the riboflavin efficiency of milk. The large quantity of FAD indicates that precautions against underestimating FAD are warranted when determining total flavin content by fluorescence. This is particularly important because the fluorescence of FAD at pH 7.0 is only 10-20% of that for riboflavin.

Sixteen blood samples were obtained from cord, and 19 at 6-8 h after birth, 14 at 1 week and 9 at 4 weeks from HM-fed infants and 18 at 1 week and 14 at 4 weeks from MF-fed ones. Groups had similar mean birth weight, gestational age and sex ratio. The MF provided 69 kcal/dl and contained 16% of linoleic acid and 1.3% of alpha-linolenic acid on the total fat. Plasma lipid fractions were extracted and separated by thin-layer chromatography and fatty acid methyl esters were quantitated by gas liquid chromatography. In plasma phospholipids, linoleic acid (18:2 omega 6) continuously increased from birth to 1 month of age, but no changes were seen as related to type of diet; polyunsaturated fatty acids greater than 18 carbon atoms of both the omega 6 and omega 3 series (PUFA omega 6 greater than 18 C and omega 3 greater than 18 C) dropped from birth to 1 week and continued to decrease in MF-fed infants until 1 month; eicosatrienoic (20:3 omega 6), arachidonic (20:4 omega 6) and docosahexaenoic (22:6 omega 3) were the fatty acids implicated. In cholesteryl esters palmitoleic (16:1 omega 7) and oleic (18:1 omega 9) acids decreased from birth to 1 month and linoleic acid increased and arachidonic acid dropped, especially in MF fed infants. In triglycerides, palmitic, palmitoleic and stearic acid (18:0) decreased during the first month of life; oleic acid remained constant and linoleic acid increased in all infants, but arachidonic acid decreased only in those fed formula.

3288250,"This thesis is based on 9 papers on the uptake of dietary antigens and on the humoral immune responses to dietary antigens, in healthy subjects and in patients with coeliac disease or atopic eczema. Work in experimental animals have indicated that dietary antigens are taken up in amounts, which are nutritionally insignificant, but may be of immunological importance. Local or systemic antibodies may retard the uptake, but in addition may increase the uptake of unrelated antigens. In humans the uptake of intact dietary antigen, free or in immune complexes, was reported in studies in healthy subjects and in patients with immune deficiency or atopy. We investigated the uptake of dietary antigen in 8 healthy subjects after a test meal, using ELISA methods and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the fractionation of serum samples. A significant finding was that ovalbumin (OA) was taken up as intact antigen or as a high MW immune complex constituent in all the 8 subjects. IgG was the only isotype demonstrable in the OA-containing aggregates, which were detected in particular in the subjects with high anti-OA antibody levels. The antigen was measurable in serum in up to 48 h after the meal. We studied with the same methods the uptake of OA and beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) in children with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet and after gluten challenge, and in controls with a normal gut mucosa. Both OA and BLG was mostly present in high MW fractions of the sera, presumably as immune complexes. The levels of antigens in serum did not differ between the children with coeliac disease and the controls. However, in 4/5 coeliac children the uptake of both antigens was increased after gluten challenge, indicating increased antigen uptake in coeliac disease. Increased gut permeability has been suggested as a pathogenic factor in food allergy. At present, there is in this condition no direct evidence for altered uptake of dietary antigens. Dietary antigens have been detected in the mother's milk and may be important for the development of normal immunity to dietary antigens and in particular of cow's milk allergy in the infant. Antibodies to dietary antigens have previously been detected in a major proportion of healthy subjects. In a limited number of sera from normals, analysed by electrophoretic techniques, we detected antibodies to bovine serum albumin and OA predominantly in the IgG class. Interestingly, these antibodies were restricted to the IgG subclasses IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",APMIS.

The cod zymogens were activated more rapidly at lower temperatures than porcine pepsinogen and, after activation, were further purified by exclusion chromatography. The cod proteases had more alkaline pH optima and were active over a wider range of pH than porcine pepsin. The specific activity of porcine pepsin on protein substrates was greater than that of the individual cod proteases. However, the cod proteases had cumulative activity on protein substrates that was greater than the sum of their individual activities. Cod protease 1 was active on pepsin-specific substrates, and cod proteases 2 and 3 were active as gastricsin-specific substrates.

Radiocopper was added to the diet in trace amounts. Ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, and gel filtration were used to show that the added 64Cu bound to milk fractions and individual binding compounds in a manner analogous to the distribution of native copper, thus validating the use of extrinsically labeled diets. Labeled diets were intubated into 14-day-old suckling rats. Animals were killed after 6 h and tissues removed and counted.

The usual practice is to dispose of it, the usage of whey being not sufficiently developed, though it contains proteins of excellent quality such as beta-lactoglobulin and alpha-lactalbumin.

Gelation of the heat-induced complex between kappa-casein and alpha-lactalbumin is described in this paper. alpha-Lactalbumin was easily separated from whey protein by the gel filtration technique on a Toyopearl HW-50 column at pH 6.0. Heat treatment facilitated the hydrolysis of a mixture of kappa-casein and alpha-lactalbumin by trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin and pronase. Heat treatment at above 75 degrees C and a protein level of over 5% were needed to form gel in 35 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.4 M NaCl. The temperature was in agreement with that at which alpha-lactalbumin denatured and formed the complex with kappa-casein. Decrease of soluble protein concentration and increase of turbidity were induced with gelation. Gel was not formed when only kappa-casein or alpha-lactalbumin was heated under the appropriate conditions. It was considered that a kappa-casein-alpha-lactalbumin gel was formed from a complex of the two proteins by heat treatment. The breaking stress of kappa-casein-alpha-lactalbumin gel was less than that of kappa-casein-beta-lactoglobulin gel.

6501791,"The absorption of deoxynivalenol (DON; vomitoxin), a trichothecene mycotoxin produced by Fusarium species, was studied in the dairy cow. Serum and milk DON levels were quantitated following a single oral dose of 920 mg DON to each of two lactating cows of similar weight. Maximum blood levels for the two animals following DON administration were 200 and 90 ng/ml serum, occurring at times 4.7 and 3.5 hr, respectively. By 24 hr after dosing only trace levels (less than 2 ng/ml) were still detectable. DON in its conjugated form accounted for 24-46% of the total levels present in serum. Free and conjugated DON were also present in cow's milk, but only extremely low amounts (less than 4 ng/ml) were detected. Detection of DON was carried out utilizing Sep-Pak C18 extraction cartridges for isolation, with additional purification of the sample achieved by passing the extract through a short charcoal/alumina column. The extract was then reacted with N-heptafluorobutyrylimidazole prior to quantitation of the resulting DON-tris-heptafluorobutyrate derivative by combined gas chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry, using multiple selected ion monitoring.

The average British diet was calculated to provide 323 micrograms I/d but only 255 micrograms if two fruit samples containing large amounts of glacé cherries were discounted. Of the total, 92 micrograms was derived from liquid milk. Meat and meat products provided 36 micrograms and cereal products 31 micrograms, but fresh fruits and sugars, vegetables and beverages provided little I. Fish and fish products, though rich in I, contributed only 5% to the total intake. 3. Milk was the most variable as well as the most important individual source of I. Summer milk samples contained 70 micrograms/kg and winter milk 370 micrograms/kg on average. Milk products, including butter and cheese, and eggs were also rich in I. 4. Some processed foods contained erythrosine, particularly glacé cherries and some pink or red confectionery items, biscuits, cherry cake, canned strawberries and luncheon meat. However, none of these are major foods in the average household diet and erythrosine would therefore contribute little more than 10 micrograms I/d to most diets. 5. The average daily intake of I was lower than in similar similar studies in the USA, but was twice the provisional UK recommended intake. This study provides no evidence that I intakes in the UK could be too low or too high for health.U",The British journal of nutrition,"['D004032', 'D005504', 'D006801', 'D007455', 'D012621', 'D006113']","['Diet', 'Food Analysis', 'Humans', 'Iodine', 'Seasons', 'United Kingdom']",Trace nutrients. 4.

The amount of available lysine was determined by two separate series of single-meal tests. In the first, a relationship was established between the plasma amino acid response (PAA ratio) and the dietary level of lysine (given as synthetic amino acid mixtures). This relationship could be described by linear regression (r = 0.90). This regression line was then used to quantitatively evaluate the lysine PAA ratios obtained from single test meals with heat-treated milk samples.

Organs of fetuses and mother rats were exenterated on the 21st day of gestation and the contents of arsenic measured using an arsenic analyzer unit with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Whole organs of the fetus were separated into 3 groupings i.e. liver, brain and remaining organs. The contents of arsenic in the organs in each of these groupings and in the placenta were measured. Even in the non-administered group, arsenic was detected in the every organ. In the arsenic administered group, the content of arsenic in the placenta was the highest among the four preparations tested; and the content in the liver and remaining organs was considerably high, but was low in the brain. The level of accumulation of arsenic differed between each organ. In the placenta, the accumulation reached a plateau, and in the brain this accumulation was below one-tenth that in the liver. In the non-administered group, arsenic was detected in the liver, kidney, spleen and brain of mother rats. In the group on arsenite, the content in the kidney and spleen was large, followed by a large amount in the liver and in the brain respectively. The level of accumulation of arsenic in mother rats differed between each organ. Arsenite was administered with antidotes such as dimercaprol, thioctic acid and L-ascorbic acid during pregnancy (from the 0 day to the 5th day). In this group the content of arsenic in the remaining organs was statistically less than that of the control group. The content in the brain was slightly reduced by a co-administration of the antidotes, however, there was no statistical difference in the placenta and liver between the antidote-treated and control groups. The content of arsenic in the kidney of mother rats treated with antidotes was statistically less than that of the controls.

47345,"Milks (bovine and human) and dairy products (butter, cheese, skim and whey powders, calf-replacer, casein, butter-oil and dietetic food) were collected during 1971/2 throughout Ireland together with a more limited samples of the 10 major animal feed ingredients, and analysed for organochlorine insecticide residues using electron-capture gas chromatography. The different materials contained low or negligible levels of chlorinated insecticides. Apart from some of the animal feed ingredients the DDT residues were generally the predominant contaminants detected together with lower levels of gamma-BHC (lindane), aldrin/dieldrin and heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide. The maximum levels of these insecticides in the bovine milk and dairy products (511, 100, 62 and 21 mug/kg fat respectively) constitute only 50% or less of the Codex Tolerance Limits. The correspondingly low residue levels in the human milk (maxima of 128, 1, 1, and 5 mug/kg fat respectively) which at most represent insecticidal ingestion by infants equivalent to 13, 0-05, 5 and 5% respectively of the WHO/FAO acceptable daily intake for DDE, gamma-BHC, aldrin/dieldrin and heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide again pose no obvious health hazards and are strongly indicative of negligible organochlorine contamination in the general diet.

4462558,"1. Turkey liver xanthine dehydrogenase engaged in catalysing the oxidation of xanthine by dichlorophenol-indophenol was progressively inactivated by methanol. This inactivation was reversible by NAD(+). 2. Reaction with arsenite and with cyanide, in each case first-order with respect to enzyme, resulted in characteristic alterations in the visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme. The rate of spectral change on reaction with either agent paralleled the rate of loss of enzyme activity. 3. Cyanide inactivation was accompanied by elimination from the enzyme of sulphur as thiocyanate. Partial restoration of activity was effected by incubation with sulphide or with selenide. The results suggest that turkey liver xanthine dehydrogenase, like milk xanthine oxidase (Massey & Edmonson, 1970), contains at the active centre a cyanolysable persulphide group essential to catalytic activity and that selenium may replace sulphur in this group to give an active enzyme. 4.
