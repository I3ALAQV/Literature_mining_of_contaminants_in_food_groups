34829121,"In general, sourdough fermentation leads to an improvement in the technological, nutritional, and sensory properties of bakery products. The use of non-conventional flours with a specific autochthonous microbiota may lead to the formation of secondary metabolites, which may even have undesirable physiological and toxicological effects. Chickpea flours from different suppliers have been used to produce sourdoughs by spontaneous and inoculated fermentations. The content of nutritionally undesirable biogenic amines (BA) and beneficial gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was determined by chromatography. Fenugreek sprouts, which are a rich source of amine oxidases, were used to reduce the BA content in the sourdoughs. Spontaneous fermentation resulted in a high accumulation of cadaverine, putrescine, and tyramine for certain flours. The use of commercial starter cultures was not effective in reducing the accumulation of BA in all sourdoughs. The addition of fenugreek sprouts to the suspension of sourdough with pH raised to 6.5 resulted in a significant reduction in BA contents. Enzymatic oxidation was less efficient during kneading. Baking resulted in only a partial degradation of BA and GABA in the crust and not in the crumb. Therefore, it could be suggested to give more importance to the control of sourdough fermentation with regard to the formation of nutritionally undesirable BA and to exploit the possibilities of their degradation.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Accumulation and Transformation of Biogenic Amines and Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) in Chickpea Sourdough.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34829121,2021
34786560,"The increasing need for sustainable food choices places a demand on developing palatable foods from lower impact production and with a suitable shelf-life. In this context, knowledge of the sensory properties of whole sterilised chickpeas is required to be able to make them more attractive to the consumers. The sensory quality of chickpeas is largely dependent on the aroma and flavour, which can be influenced by storage conditions. In this study, sterilised chickpeas in two different packaging materials with different oxygen permeabilities, stored up to 52 weeks at ambient temperature (20 °C) were investigated using both descriptive sensory profiling and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry - olfactometry analysis (GC-MS-O). During storage, intense, sulphury and meat-like aromas decreased in intensity, while with longer storage time hay-like, green-like and potato-like flavours and aromas became more apparent. A total of 40 odour-active volatiles were detected, of which some had properties reminiscent of the chickpea flavour profiles. However, no clear relationships could be established between these odorants and the sensory changes observed during storage by descriptive sensory analysis. It was concluded that, significant changes in the sensory attributes of sterilised chickpeas occurred during 52 weeks of storage, but that packaging material does not seem to largely influence the sensory attributes during storage.",Current research in food science,[],[],Flavour stability of sterilised chickpeas stored in pouches.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34786560,2021
34201792,"Pulse crop seed coats are a sustainable source of antioxidant polyphenols, but are typically treated as low-value products, partly because some polyphenols reduce iron bioavailability in humans. This study correlates antioxidant/iron chelation capabilities of diverse seed coat types from five major pulse crops (common bean, lentil, pea, chickpea and faba bean) with polyphenol composition using mass spectrometry. Untargeted metabolomics was used to identify key differences and a hierarchical analysis revealed that common beans had the most diverse polyphenol profiles among these pulse crops. The highest antioxidant capacities were found in seed coats of black bean and all tannin lentils, followed by maple pea, however, tannin lentils showed much lower iron chelation among these seed coats. Thus, tannin lentils are more desirable sources as natural antioxidants in food applications, whereas black bean and maple pea are more suitable sources for industrial applications. Regardless of pulse crop, proanthocyanidins were primary contributors to antioxidant capacity, and to a lesser extent, anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols, whereas glycosylated flavonols contributed minimally. Higher iron chelation was primarily attributed to proanthocyanidin composition, and also myricetin 3-","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000975', 'D044946', 'D001682', 'D002392', 'D029863', 'D000078331', 'D005419', 'D044948', 'D020128', 'D007502', 'D027806', 'D013058', 'D055432', 'D010636', 'D059808', 'D044945', 'D012639', 'D013634', 'D031307']","['Antioxidants', 'Biflavonoids', 'Biological Availability', 'Catechin', 'Cicer', 'Correlation of Data', 'Flavonoids', 'Flavonols', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lens Plant', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolomics', 'Phenols', 'Polyphenols', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Seeds', 'Tannins', 'Vicia faba']",An Untargeted Metabolomics Approach for Correlating Pulse Crop Seed Coat Polyphenol Profiles with Antioxidant Capacity and Iron Chelation Ability.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201792,2021

The soluble protein, peptide, and free amino nitrogen contents; proteinase activity; degradation of protein; peptide profiles; and the antioxidant activities during fermentation were investigated. Results indicated that during the fermentation process, increasing the protease activity resulted in increased release of soluble proteins, peptides, and free amino nitrogen (FAN), which reached their maximum values (15.4 mg/g, 25.8 mg/g, and 1.03 g/100 g, respectively) at 48 h of fermentation. The electrophoretic profiles indicated that most chickpea proteins were degraded after fermentation for 24 h. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated a decreased/disappearance of hydrophobic/large peptides and increased hydrophilic/small peptides. Moreover, the fermented chickpeas showed higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities than the unfermented chickpeas.

PCs from six beans were purified (purity > 98.2%) by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and subsequently identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-Quadrupole (Q)-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-HRMS). Results showed that the PC content of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and soybean (Glycine max) was 50.0 and 34.0 mg/g, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of other beans (P < 0.05). Gas chromatographic analysis showed that soybean contained high proportion of PUFA (58.78%), and chickpea contained high proportion of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (2.73%). A total of 49 molecular species were identified by UHPLC-Q-HRMS. (18:2-18:2)PC was predominant in soybean, adzuki bean, runner bean, and common bean. (16:0-18:1)PC was the major species of chickpea PC, and many ether PC species and DHA-PC were identified. Discriminatory analysis by principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the molecular profiles of chickpea PC were significantly different from other beans studied. The findings suggest that chickpea appears to be an interesting plant source of DHA and ether lipids for dietary supplement. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, we reported an UHPLC-Q-HRMS technique to identify PC molecular species of six beans. The diversity of PC molecular species in the different beans was classified using chemometrics. This analytical method not only provides comprehensive information to nutritionists about the PC distribution in different beans, but also can identify biomarkers for bean flour fraud identification in food supplementation.

The assays were performed with a view that larvae are a voracious feeder and cause substantial damage to the pod within 12 h.

Four-week-old seedlings of a grain legume, chickpea, were subjected to gradual dehydration, and NPs were extracted from unstressed control and from 72- and 144-hr stressed tissues. We identified 4,832 NPs and 478 phosphosites, corresponding to 299 unique NPPs involved in multivariate cellular processes including protein modification and gene expression regulation, among others. The identified proteins included several novel kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors, besides 660 uncharacterized proteins. Spliceosome complex and splicing related proteins were dominant among differentially regulated NPPs, indicating their dehydration modulated regulation. Phospho-motif analysis revealed stress-induced enrichment of proline-directed serine phosphorylation. Association mapping of NPPs revealed predominance of differential phosphorylation of spliceosome and splicing associated proteins. Also, regulatory proteins of key processes viz., protein degradation, regulation of flowering time, and circadian clock were observed to undergo dehydration-induced dephosphorylation. The characterization of novel regulatory proteins would provide new insights into stress adaptation and enable directed genetic manipulations for developing climate-resilient crops.","Plant, cell & environment","['D029863', 'D003681', 'D008401', 'D018506', 'D009687', 'D010750', 'D010766', 'D010940', 'D020543', 'D036226']","['Cicer', 'Dehydration', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Seedlings']",Dehydration-responsive nuclear proteome landscape of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) reveals phosphorylation-mediated regulation of stress response.,"['Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","['metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29749054,2020
29146326,"To detect the changes in molecular structure of chickpea starch during processing treatments, a thin layer chromatographic method for characterizing the molecular structure of chickpea starch was developed. With this method, the components in chickpea starch could be divided into amylopectin, small linear molecules and large linear molecules, and their contents could be determined. It was found that the degrees of polymerization of the large linear molecules and small linear molecules in chickpea enzyme-resistant starch were about 40 and below 15, respectively. Furthermore, the small linear molecules were more susceptible to α-amylase hydrolysis than the large linear molecules. The results suggested that the large linear molecules and small linear molecules in chickpea enzyme-resistant starch might mainly originate from the amylose and amylopectin of native chickpea starch, respectively, based on the retrogradation properties of amylose and amylopectin and the enzymatic degradation behavior of the large linear molecules and small linear molecules.",Food chemistry,"['D002855', 'D029863', 'D005511', 'D006868', 'D013213']","['Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Cicer', 'Food Handling', 'Hydrolysis', 'Starch']",Changes in molecular structure of chickpea starch during processing treatments: A thin layer chromatography study.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146326,2018

Acrylamide level was above the European Commission indicative value in potato- and cereal-based food products, it ranged from 3436.13 to 5562.56 μg/kg in roots and tubers (potato and sweet potato). Among the cereals, maize (2195.31 μg/kg) and wheat (161.12 μg/kg) had the highest and lowest contents, respectively, whereas rice, sorghum and pearl millet showed intermediate values. Among the 2 legumes, soybean contained higher acrylamide (337.08-717.52 μg/kg) than chickpea (377.83-480.49 μg/kg).

27200483,"Chickpea (CP), a legume of the family Fabaceae, is an important nutrient-rich food providing protein, essential amino acids, vitamins, dietary fibre, and minerals. Unfortunately, several IgE-binding proteins in CP have been detected that are responsible for allergic manifestations in sensitized population. Therefore, the prevalence of CP induced allergy prompted us towards purification, characterization and allergenicity assessment of a major ∼26kDa protein from chickpea crude protein extract (CP-CPE). Purification of CP 26kDa protein was done using a combination of fractionation and anion exchange chromatography. This protein was further characterized as ""Chain A, crystal structure of a plant albumin"" from Cicer arietinum with Mol wt 25.8kDa by Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Further, allergenic potential of purified 25.8kDa protein was assessed using in vivo and in vitro model. Purified protein showed IgE-binding capacity with sensitized BALB/c mice and CP allergic patient's sera. Enhanced levels of specific and total IgE, MCP-1, MCPT-1, myeloperoxidase, histamine, prostaglandin D2, and cysteinyl leukotriene were found in sera of mice treated with CP ∼26kDa protein. Further, expressions of Th2 cytokines (i.e. IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), transcription factors (i.e. GATA-3, STAT-6, SOCS-3) and mast cell signaling proteins (Lyn, cFgr, Syk, PLC-γ2, PI-3K, PKC) were also found increased at mRNA and protein levels in the intestines of mice treated with CP ∼26kDa protein. In addition, enhanced release of β-hexosaminidase, histamine, cysteinyl leukotriene and prostaglandin D2 were observed in RBL2H3 cell line when treated (125μg) with CP 26kDa protein. Conclusively, in vivo and in vitro studies revealed the allergenic potential of purified CP 26kDa protein.

24083463,"Reversible protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous regulatory mechanism that plays critical roles in transducing stress signals to bring about coordinated intracellular responses. To gain better understanding of dehydration response in plants, we have developed a differential phosphoproteome in a food legume, chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Three-week-old chickpea seedlings were subjected to progressive dehydration by withdrawing water, and the changes in the phosphorylation status of a large repertoire of proteins were monitored. The proteins were resolved by 2-DE and stained with phosphospecific fluorescent Pro-Q Diamond dye. Mass spectrometric analysis led to the identification of 91 putative phosphoproteins, presumably involved in a variety of functions including cell defense and rescue, photosynthesis and photorespiration, molecular chaperones, and ion transport, among others. Multiple sites of phosphorylation were predicted on several key elements, which include both the regulatory as well as the functional proteins. A critical survey of the phosphorylome revealed a DREPP (developmentally regulated plasma membrane protein) plasma membrane polypeptide family protein, henceforth designated CaDREPP1. The transcripts of CaDREPP1 were found to be differentially regulated under dehydration stress, further corroborating the proteomic results.

Untreated 2S albumin had little inhibitory activity against trypsin, spore germination, or hyphal growth of Aspergillus flavus. However, following treatment of 2S albumin with SDS, increased inhibitory activity was demonstrated. We further purified 2S albumin using Sephadex G-100 and DEAE cellulose (DE-32) chromatography. HPLC analysis showed that the partially pure 2S albumin consisted of two polypeptides, whereas SDS-PAGE analyzes exhibited six polypeptides. One of the polypeptides, 2S-1, was found to contain the same molecular weight and enzymatic properties as the peanut protease inhibitor (PI); however, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of 2S-1 differed from that of PI.

Chickpea is consumed in Mediterranean countries, and reportedly associated with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. However, the nature of allergic reactions to chickpea has not been characterized. A serum pool from paediatric patients allergic to chickpeas was used to detect IgE-binding proteins from chickpea seeds by immunoassay and immunoblot inhibition assay. Protein samples enriched in chickpea legumin and vicilin were obtained by anion exchange chromatography, and were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. IgE-immunoassays of globulin fractions from chickpeas revealed that vicilin (50 kDa) and the basic subunit of legumin (20 kDa) were bound by IgE from patient sera. Pea and lentil protein extracts strongly inhibited the IgE binding to chickpea globulin. We speculate that vicilin and the basic subunit of legumin are major chickpea allergens.

A modified approach of the QuEChERS methodology was used to extract the analytes from the food samples. The proposed method includes a two-step extraction process and allows the determination of isoflavones in pulses without the need of a clean-up step. Use of this methodology for the extraction of natural occurring substances provides advantages such as simplicity and ease of use, especially taking into account the complexity of food matrices. The method was applied successfully for the determination of eight isoflavones, including aglycones and glucosides, in legumes of Spanish origin (chickpeas, lentils and beans from the region of Castilla y León). The target compounds were the glucosides daidzin, glycitin and genistin, and the aglycones daidzein, glycitein, genistein, formononetin, and biochanin A. The detection limits were in the 0.7 μg L(-1) to 1.5 μg L(-1) range for formononetin and glycitin respectively.

In analytical conditions, the pH value of the run buffer was similar to that of the hydrolyzed samples, which helps in avoiding interactions of the analyte with silanol groups of the inner wall of the fused silica capillary. In all previous CE methods proposed in literature, no SPE treatment has been used. The method has been applied to the analysis of food products, such as flour, having low amounts of furosine. Flour samples of different origin (wheat, chestnut, lupin, einkorn, chickpeas) have been investigated. Different food products such as pasta, milk, and tigelle bread (a typical Italian unleavened bread) were also analyzed. Some of the samples have also been analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC, and when compared to CE-MS, data obtained showed good agreement. CE-MS, in comparison to HPLC, showed advantages in terms of time of analysis and cost.

22417358,"Chickpeas are of excellent quality (protein, vitamins, minerals, unsaturated fatty acids) and very low in phytoestrogen, making them a potentially promising source for vegetarian-based infant formula (VBIF). However, their high starch and fiber concentration could hinder their utilization for infants. To overcome this natural shortcoming, a solid-state ""enzymation"" (SSE) process was developed in which imbibition of exogenous enzyme facilitates hydrolysis within the intact chickpea seed. The process was termed seed enzyme reactor (SER). Liquid imbibition data of dry chickpeas during soaking were fitted with the Weibull distribution model. The derived Weibull shape parameter, β, value (0.77 ± 0.11) indicated that the imbibition mechanism followed Fickian diffusion. Imbibition occurred through the coat and external layers. The process was tested using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as an exogenous marker, and involved soaking, thermal treatment, peeling, microwave partial drying, rehydration in enzyme solution, and SSE at an adjusted pH, time, and temperature. Amylases, or a combination of amylases and cellulases, resulted in significant carbohydrate hydrolysis (23% and 47% of the available starch, respectively).

21305157,"The plant metallothionein 2 from Cicer arietinum (chickpea; cicMT2) is a typical member of this subfamily and features two cysteine-rich regions containing eight and six cysteine residues, respectively, separated by a linker region 41 amino acids in length. This metallothionein thus differs significantly from the well-studied vertebrate forms. A synthetic gene encoding cicMT2 was designed, cloned into a suitable vector, and the protein was over-expressed in Escherichia coli. For the first time, an in-depth spectroscopic characterization of cicMT2 in the presence of divalent metal ions is performed showing a binding capacity for five Zn(II), Cd(II), or Co(II) ions and the typical features of metal-thiolate clusters. Based on proteolytic digestion experiments, the cluster arrangement formed by the divalent metal ions and the cysteine thiolate groups connects the amino-terminal with the carboxy-terminal cysteine-rich region. The cluster formation process, put into effect with the addition of the fourth metal ion to the apo protein, was investigated using the characteristic shift of absorption bands observed in the UV/Vis spectra upon titration with Co(II). The pH-dependent Zn(II)- and Cd(II)-thiolate cluster stability is one of the highest observed for plant MTs so far, but lower than that usually found in vertebrate metallothioneins. The dependence of the pH stability on the ionic strength of the solution is more pronounced for the Cd(II)- than for the Zn(II)-form of the protein.",Metallomics : integrated biometal science,"['D000595', 'D001483', 'D002104', 'D002850', 'D029863', 'D004591', 'D006863', 'D008667', 'D008969', 'D010940', 'D055550', 'D011994', 'D016415', 'D016622', 'D012965', 'D021241', 'D013056', 'D013438', 'D015032']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cadmium', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cicer', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Metalloproteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Proteins', 'Protein Stability', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Silver Staining', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds', 'Zinc']",The plant metallothionein 2 from Cicer arietinum forms a single metal-thiolate cluster.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21305157,2011

Four groups of individual phenolic compounds, including phenolic acids, anthocyanins, and flavan-3-ols, as well as flavonols and flavones were quantified using HPLC, respectively. As compared to the original raw legumes, all processing methods caused significant (p<0.05) reduction in total phenolic content, procyanidin content, total saponin content, phytic acid content, chemical antioxidant capacities in terms of ferric reducing antioxidant power and peroxyl radical scavenging capacity, and cellular antioxidant activity as well as antiproliferation capacities of cool-season food legumes. Different cooking methods have varied effects on reducing total phenolics, saponins, phytic acids, and individual phenolic compounds. For all cool-season food legumes, steaming appeared to be a better cooking method than boiling in retaining antioxidants and phenolic components, whereas boiling appeared to be effective in reducing saponin and phytic acid contents. In the case of lentil, all thermal processing methods (except conventional steaming) caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in gallic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, sinapic, subtotal benzoic, subtotal cinnamic acid, and total phenolic acid.

Both varieties accumulated arsenate to similar levels and most of the metalloid was confined to roots, only about 2.5% was translocated to shoot. Plant growth was also not affected significantly in both the varieties. Arsenate exposure significantly induced the levels of thiols including PCs and homophytochelatins (hPCs). The induction of thiols was much higher in roots than shoots and was greater in var C-235 between the two tested ones.

Evidence is mainly against all-E-beta-carotene, while there is no evidence against other carotenoids or against mixtures of beta-carotene stereoisomers. Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets. Population consumption patterns of carotenoid isomers using a comprehensive database are used to improve our understanding in disease prevention.

Plants respond and adapt to such stress by altering their cellular metabolism and activating various defense machineries. Mechanisms that operate signal perception, transduction, and downstream regulatory events provide valuable information about the underlying pathways involved in environmental stress responses. The nuclear proteins constitute a highly organized, complex network that plays diverse roles during cellular development and other physiological processes. To gain a better understanding of dehydration response in plants, we have developed a comparative nuclear proteome in a food legume, chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Three-week-old chickpea seedlings were subjected to progressive dehydration by withdrawing water and the changes in the nuclear proteome were examined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Approximately 205 protein spots were found to be differentially regulated under dehydration. Mass spectrometry analysis allowed the identification of 147 differentially expressed proteins, presumably involved in a variety of functions including gene transcription and replication, molecular chaperones, cell signaling, and chromatin remodeling. The dehydration responsive nuclear proteome of chickpea revealed a coordinated response, which involves both the regulatory as well as the functional proteins.

The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the presence of the isoflavones daidzein, glycitein, genistein and their conjugated forms in grains and leaves of several leguminous plants utilized largely in Brazilian cuisine. Grains used in Peruvian cuisine were also analyzed. After extracting phenolic compounds with methanol (80%), isoflavones as detected by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/ diode-array detector were only found in chickpeas and soybean. Chickpea extracts showed only the isoflavone genistein at 31 microg/g defatted flour. Detection of these isoflavones was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass and tandem mass spectrometric experiments. For soybean, a distinct distribution of isoflavones was found in hypocotyls and cotyledon. The highest concentration of isoflavones found was approximately 5.9 mg/g for hypocotyls, whereas the total concentration of isoflavone was around 0.4 mg/g for the cotyledons (dry matter).

17428066,"Chickpea protein hydrolysates obtained with alcalase and flavourzyme were used for purification of copper chelating peptides by affinity chromatography using copper immobilized on solid supports. The chelating activity of purified peptides was indirectly measured by the inhibition of beta-carotene oxidation in the presence of copper. Two protein hydrolysates, obtained after 10 and 100 min of hydrolysis, were the most inhibitory of beta-carotene oxidation. Purified copper chelating peptides from these protein hydrolysates contained 19.7 and 35.1% histidine, respectively, in comparison to 2.7 and 2.6% in the protein hydrolysates. Chelating peptides from hydrolysate obtained after 10 min of hydrolysis were the most antioxidative being 8.3 times more antioxidative than the hydrolysate, while chelating peptides purified from protein hydrolysate obtained after 100 min were 3.1 times more antioxidative than its hydrolysate. However, the histidine content was higher in peptides derived from the 100 min hydrolysate (19.7 against 35.1% in 10 min hydrolysate), indicating that this amino acid is not the only factor involved in the antioxidative activity, and other factors such as peptide size or amino acid sequence are also determinant. This manuscript shows that affinity chromatography is a useful procedure for purification of copper chelating peptides.

12428011,"In most species, the synthesis of ADP-glucose (Glc) by the enzyme ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) occurs entirely within the plastids in all tissues so far examined. However, in the endosperm of many, if not all grasses, a second form of AGPase synthesizes ADP-Glc outside the plastid, presumably in the cytosol. In this paper, we show that in the endosperm of wheat (Triticum aestivum), the cytosolic form accounts for most of the AGPase activity. Using a combination of molecular and biochemical approaches to identify the cytosolic and plastidial protein components of wheat endosperm AGPase we show that the large and small subunits of the cytosolic enzyme are encoded by genes previously thought to encode plastidial subunits, and that a gene, Ta.AGP.S.1, which encodes the small subunit of the cytosolic form of AGPase, also gives rise to a second transcript by the use of an alternate first exon. This second transcript encodes an AGPase small subunit with a transit peptide. However, we could not find a plastidial small subunit protein corresponding to this transcript. The protein sequence of the purified plastidial small subunit does not match precisely to that encoded by Ta.AGP.S.1 or to the predicted sequences of any other known gene from wheat or barley (Hordeum vulgare). Instead, the protein sequence is most similar to those of the plastidial small subunits from chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) seeds.

The highest amounts of free nonprotein amino acids and trigonelline are found in garden pea (28.3 mg/100 g), mungbean (9.59 mg/100 g), and lentil (7.50 mg/100 g) seedlings. Trigonelline is present in all legume seedlings examined.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000470', 'D000596', 'D002851', 'D003257', 'D005060', 'D007887', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D018520', 'D010946']","['Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Europe', 'Fabaceae', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Plant Shoots', 'Plants, Medicinal']",Free amino acids present in commercially available seedlings sold for human consumption.

10514988,"A trienzyme treatment (conjugase, alpha-amylase, protease) followed by affinity chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC with UV and fluorescence detection was performed for the quantification of folate vitamers in legumes (chickpea and beans), processed meats (salami Milano and Parma ham) and in an Italian reference diet. This method allowed a good separation of six folate vitamers: 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, folic acid, 10-formylfolic acid, 10-formyldihydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate within 30 min. Recovery, reproducibility and limits of detection of the method are reported. HPLC results were 24-52% lower than the microbiological assay findings.",Journal of chromatography.
