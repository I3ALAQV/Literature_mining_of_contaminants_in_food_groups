35760587,"Edible palm hearts (EPH), known as palmito, chonta or swamp cabbage in America or umbut in Malaysia, is a type of vegetable harvested from palm tree species. EPH is firm and smooth and described as having a flavor resembling artichoke. It has underlying prebiotic potential that selectively stimulates the growth and activity of beneficial colonic microbiota, thus enhancing the host's health. This study is the first to present results of EPH from local species such as oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), sago palm (Metroxylon sagu) and coconut (Cocos nucifera) using in vitro colonic fermentation with human fecal slurry. Samples obtained at 0, 6, 12 and 24 h were evaluated by bacterial enumeration using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).",Journal of the science of food and agriculture,[],[],An in vitro study: prebiotic effects of edible palm hearts in batch human fecal fermentation system.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35760587,2022
34866108,"Oils and lipids are common food components and efficient sources of energy. Both the quantity and the quality of oils and lipids are important with regard to health and disease. Fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) is a novel lipid class that was discovered as an endogenous lipid; FAHFAs have shown anti-diabetic effects in a mammalian system. We analyzed the overall FAHFA composition in nut oils and other common oils: almond (raw, roasted), walnut, peanut, olive, palm, soybean, and rapeseed oils. We developed a method of liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) for a comprehensive target analysis of FAHFAs. The analysis revealed wide variation in the FAHFA profiles (15 compounds and 62 peaks). For 7-11 compounds of FAHFA, a total level of 8-29 pmol/mg oil was detected in nuts oils; for 11 compounds, 4.9 pmol/mg oil was detected in olive oil, and for 4-9 compounds, < 2 pmol/mg oil was detected in palm, soy, and rapeseed oils. The major FAHFAs were FAHFA 36:3, FAHFA 36:2, and FAHFA 36:4 in nut oil, FAHFA 36:2, FAHFA 34:1, and FAHFA 36:1 in olive oil, and FAHFA 32:1, FAHFA 34:0, FAHFA 36:0, and FAHFA 36:1 in all of the common oils. The composition of FAHFAs in nut oils is mainly unsaturated fatty acids, whereas those in olive oil are unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. The composition of FAHFAs in common oils was mainly saturated fats. This is the first report to demonstrate the quality and quantity of the FAHFAs in the nut oils. Nuts have been described to be a great source of many nutrients and to be beneficial for our health.

However, many diabetes patients consume food with higher fat content for a better taste bud experience. In this study, we examined the effect of HFD on rats at the early onset of diabetes and prediabetes by supplementing their feed with palm olein oil to provide a fat content representing 39% of total calorie intake. Urinary profile generated from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to construct the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plots. The data provide insights into the physiological state of an organism. Healthy rats fed with normal chow (NC) and HFD cannot be distinguished by their urinary metabolite profiles, whereas diabetic and prediabetic rats showed a clear separation in OPLS-DA profile between the two diets, indicating a change in their physiological state. Metformin treatment altered the metabolomics profiles of diabetic rats and lowered their blood sugar levels. For prediabetic rats, metformin treatment on both NC- and HFD-fed rats not only reduced their blood sugar levels to normal but also altered the urinary metabolite profile to be more like healthy rats.

31082722,"Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) are a group of man-made pollutants of growing environmental concern. Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) were recently classified as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), while medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) are still unregulated. Foodstuff is a major pathway for the human CP intake, and the regular diet has been analyzed in several studies recently. However, dietary supplements (DS) had not been analyzed on CPs. Our goal was to investigate the occurrence of CPs in DS and to evaluate the possible threat for the consumers. DS (n = 25) made from plant or fish oils were selected on the German market with main emphasis on vitamin E products. The lipid components were removed by sulphuric acid treatment and silica gel column chromatography. CP quantification was performed via gas chromatography coupled to electron capture negative ion mass spectrometry. Six vitamin E preparations containing palm oil showed alarmingly high CP concentrations of >35 μg/g fat. Six other DS contained much lower CP amounts (<4 μg/g fat). If consumed as recommended, the mean daily intake of CPs (5.5 μg SCCPs + 38 μg MCCPs) via palm oil based DS surpassed that of the regular diet by a factor of 4 for SCCPs and 13 for MCCPs, exceeding the PCB intake via food by up to two orders of magnitude. Samples reached up to 26% of the TDI of MCCPs for an average European adult. Consequently, the P95 intake of those samples would amount to ~43 mg CPs per year. The CP contamination probably originated from raw material, as CPs were also found in palm oils and vitamin E concentrates made from palm oil. Our findings suggest that DS can contain high amounts of contaminants that compromise the purpose of the product and should be considered for regular CP monitoring.",Environment international,"['D019587', 'D004784', 'D005858', 'D006843', 'D000073878', 'D010232', 'D014810']","['Dietary Supplements', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Germany', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated', 'Palm Oil', 'Paraffin', 'Vitamin E']",High amounts of chlorinated paraffins in oil-based vitamin E dietary supplements on the German market.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082722,2019

The protein profiles of the digestive systems of the larvae fed on these three diets were also determined. Although the coconut diet was the most consumed by RPW larvae compared to oil palm and sago diets, the growth rate of RPW larvae on oil palm diet was however significantly shorter than those on the coconut and sago diets: the RPW only need 1 mo and 9 d to complete the larval duration.

Olive oil was confirmed to have the highest MUFA content due to a valuable level of oleic acid, while oils from grapeseed, Brazil nut and canola were marked by nutritionally important PUFA levels. The highest SFA content found in coconut oil was mainly due to the high levels of lauric acid, known for its advantageous HDL-raising effects. As for polyphenols, gourmet oils from palm, coconut and canola showed higher levels of phenolic acids (e.g. p-hydroxybenzoic, ferulic, syringic, acids) than olive oil, which was though characterized by peculiar antioxidants, such as tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol. Also, olive oil had the highest amount of squalene, followed by the oil from Brazil nut. Finally, all the investigated oils had very low levels (order of μg/kg) of pro-oxidant elements, such as Cu, Fe and Mn. Overall, these findings may fill the gaps still present in literature on certain compositional aspects of commercially available gourmet oils.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D031383', 'D001938', 'D002849', 'D002851', 'D000074263', 'D005229', 'D005410', 'D005504', 'D005511', 'D039106', 'D008903', 'D009754', 'D000069463', 'D000073878', 'D027421', 'D010938', 'D059808', 'D000074262', 'D012639', 'D021241', 'D013185', 'D027843']","['Bertholletia', 'Brazil', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coconut Oil', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated', 'Flame Ionization', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Macadamia', 'Minerals', 'Nuts', 'Olive Oil', 'Palm Oil', 'Persea', 'Plant Oils', 'Polyphenols', 'Rapeseed Oil', 'Seeds', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Squalene', 'Vitis']",Chemical characterization of a variety of cold-pressed gourmet oils available on the Brazilian market.,"['Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803478,2019

Respective analytical methods should provide a fast screening and a reliable cost-efficient quantitation. HPTLC was pointed out as key analytical technique in this field. A new HPTLC method applying caffeine-impregnated silica gel plates was developed for eight most frequently found fat-soluble azo dyes unauthorizedly added to spices, spice mixtures, pastes, sauces, and palm oils. A simple post-chromatographic UV irradiation provided an effective sample cleanup, which took 4 min for up to 46 samples in parallel. The method was trimmed to enable 23 simultaneous separations within 20 min for quantitation or 46 separations within 5 min for screening. Linear (4-40 ng/band) or polynomial (10-200 ng/band) calibrations of the eight azo dyes revealed high correlation coefficients and low standard deviations. Limits of detection and quantification were determined to be 2-3 and 6-9 ng/zone, respectively. After an easy sample extraction, recoveries of 70-120% were obtained from chili, paprika, and curcuma powder as well as from chili sauce, curry paste, and palm oil spiked at low (mainly 25-50 mg/kg) and high levels (150-300 mg/kg).

To investigate organochlorine compounds in vegetable oils as possible precursors for 3-MCPD esters, we tested crude palm, soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, corn, coconut, and olive oils for the presence of organochlorine compounds. Having found them in all vegetable oils tested, we focused subsequent study on oil palm products. Analysis of the chlorine isotope mass pattern exhibited in high-resolution mass spectrometry enabled organochlorine compound identification in crude palm oils as constituents of wax esters, fatty acid, diacylglycerols, and sphingolipids, which are produced endogenously in oil palm mesocarp throughout ripening. Analysis of thermal decomposition and changes during refining suggested that these naturally present organochlorine compounds in palm oils and perhaps in other vegetable oils are precursors of 3-MCPD esters.

Due to the dwindling availability of agricultural land and increasing demand for high yielding oil palm seedlings, clonal propagation is vital to the oil palm industry. Most commonly, leaf explants are used for in vitro micropropagation of oil palm and to optimize this process it is important to unravel the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying somatic embryo production from leaves. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to determine protein abundance of mature oil palm leaves. To do this, leaf proteins were extracted using TCA/acetone precipitation protocol and separated by 2DE. A total of 191 protein spots were observed on the 2D gels and 67 of the most abundant protein spots that were consistently observed were selected for further analysis with 35 successfully identified using MALDI TOF/TOF MS.

Limited epidemiological and animal data suggest that flavonoids, and specifically anthocyanins, may increase EPA and DHA levels, potentially by increasing their synthesis from the shorter-chain n-3 PUFA, α-linolenic acid. Using complimentary cell, rodent and human studies we investigated the impact of anthocyanins and anthocyanin-rich foods/extracts on plasma and tissue EPA and DHA levels and on the expression of fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), which represents the rate limiting enzymes in EPA and DHA synthesis. In experiment 1, rats were fed a standard diet containing either palm oil or rapeseed oil supplemented with pure anthocyanins for 8 weeks. Retrospective fatty acid analysis was conducted on plasma samples collected from a human randomized controlled trial where participants consumed an elderberry extract for 12 weeks (experiment 2). HepG2 cells were cultured with α-linolenic acid with or without select anthocyanins and their in vivo metabolites for 24 h and 48 h (experiment 3). The fatty acid composition of the cell membranes, plasma and liver tissues were analyzed by gas chromatography. Anthocyanins and anthocyanin-rich food intake had no significant impact on EPA or DHA status or FADS2 gene expression in any model system. These data indicate little impact of dietary anthocyanins on n-3 PUFA distribution and suggest that the increasingly recognized benefits of anthocyanins are unlikely to be the result of a beneficial impact on tissue fatty acid status.

Migration experiments were performed over a 10-day period using USFDA-recommended food simulants (10% ethanol, 50% ethanol, corn oil and Miglyol) along with several other food oils. At the end of the 10 days, solvent dyes had migrated from the PS bowls at 12, 1 and 31,000 ng cm(-)(2) into coconut oil, palm kernel oil and Miglyol respectively, and in coconut oil and Miglyol the colour change was visible to the human eye. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed that the functional barrier was no longer intact for the bowls exposed to coconut oil, palm kernel oil, Miglyol, 10% ethanol, 50% ethanol and goat's milk. Additional tests showed that 1-dodecanol, a lauryl alcohol derived from palm kernel oil and coconut oil, was present in the PS bowls at an average concentration of 11 mg kg(-1). This compound is likely to have been used as a dispersing agent for the solvent dye and aided the migration of the solvent dye from the PS bowl into the food simulant. The solvent dye was not found in the 10% ethanol, 50% ethanol and goat's milk food simulants above their respective limits of detection, which is likely to be due to its insolubility in aqueous solutions. A disrupted barrier layer is of concern because if there are unregulated materials in the inner layers of the laminate, they may migrate to food, and therefore be considered unapproved food additives resulting in the food being deemed adulterated under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.","Food additives & contaminants.

Natural phenolics contained in the current AOB are usually polyhydroxy derivatives exhibiting hydrophilic character, which has been marked as water-soluble AOB (AOB-w). In order to broaden the application fields, oil-soluble AOB (cAOB-o) was obtained by chemical acylation of AOB-w with different chain-length fatty acids varying from C8 to C18. Results indicated that the yield and solubility of cAOB-o in 1-octanol solvent depended on the carbon chain length of acyl donor, and cAOB-o derived from C12 fatty acid exhibited the more powerful antioxidant activity evaluated by β-carotene/linoleic acid bleaching assay. Total phenolic content decreased by Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Fourier transform infrared spectra showed the increase of a carbonyl (C = O) peak at 1701 cm(-1) and a decrease in the intensity of the absorption at 3400 cm(-1) (O-H stretching) in cAOB-o. Acylation was inferred to mainly occur on the hydroxyl groups of flavones C-glycosides according to the change of high-performance liquid chromatography spectra and the contents of total flavonoids and phenolic acids. cAOB-o with the addition of 0.02% significantly increased oxidative stability of palm oil 1.59 times, lard 3.74 times, and fried potato chips 2.08 times, which was better than the effect of oil-soluble tea polyphenol (P < 0.01).

Proximate composition (moisture, ash, fat, protein, and carbohydrates) and fatty acid composition were evaluated on milk and ice cream, and sensorial analysis, color (lightness, green/red, and blue/yellow), overrun, and texture were evaluated on the ice cream. Fatty acids present in milk and ice cream were determined by gas chromatography. Sensory analysis results showed that the ice cream acceptability index was above 70%. No difference was observed for proximate composition in milk and ice cream. Chromatographic analysis showed an increase in saturated fatty acid concentration in CON and lower levels in PAL; polyunsaturated fatty acid concentration was higher in PAL and lower in CON, in milk and ice cream; monounsaturated fatty acid concentration in milk was higher in PAL and lower in CON but no difference was found in ice cream.

24083564,"Palm oil is a highly versatile commodity with wide applications in the food, cosmetics, and biofuel industries. Storage oil in the oil palm mesocarp can make up a remarkable 80% of its dry mass, making it the oil crop with the richest oil content in the world. As such, there has been an ongoing interest in understanding the mechanism of oil production in oil palm fruits. To identify the proteome changes during oil palm fruit maturation and factors affecting oil yield in oil palm fruits, we examined the proteomic profiles of oil palm mesocarps at four developing stages--12, 16, 18, and 22 weeks after pollination--by 8-plex iTRAQ labeling coupled to 2D-LC and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. It was found that proteins from several important metabolic processes, including starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis, pentose phosphate shunt, fatty acid biosynthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, were differentially expressed in a concerted manner. These increases led to an increase in carbon flux and a diversion of resources such as ATP and NADH that are required for lipid biosynthesis. The temporal proteome profiles between the high-oil-yielding (HY) and low-oil-yielding (LY) fruits also showed significant differences in the levels of proteins involved in the regulation of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. In particular, the expression level of the β subunit of the ATP synthase complex (complex IV of the electron transport chain) was found to be increased during fruit maturation in HY but decreased in the LY during the fruit maturation. These results suggested that increased energy supply is necessary for augmented oil yield in the HY oil palm trees.",Journal of proteome research,"['D028023', 'D002853', 'D005638', 'D018507', 'D018506', 'D010766', 'D010938', 'D010940', 'D040901', 'D053719']","['Arecaceae', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Oils', 'Plant Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Proteomic analysis of the oil palm fruit mesocarp reveals elevated oxidative phosphorylation activity is critical for increased storage oil production.,"['Q000235', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000379', None]","['genetics', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083564,2014

The particulates from the exhaust of the engines were collected every 500 hr using a four-stage cascade air sampler. The 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameters for the first three stages were 10, 2.5 and 1 microm, while the last stage collected all particles smaller than 1 microm. Sixteen particle bounded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography. The results indicated that the size distribution of particulate matter was in the accumulation mode and the pattern of total PAHs associated with fine-particles (< 1 microm) showed a dominance of larger molecular weight PAHs (4-6 aromatic rings), especially pyrene. The mass median diameter, PM and total PAH concentrations decreased when increasing the palm oil content, but increased when the running hours of the engine were increased. In addition, Commercial petroleum diesel (PB0) gave the highest value of carcinogenic potency equivalent (BaP(eq)) for all particle size ranges.

22168150,"Recently, organic and inorganic chlorinated compounds were detected in crude and commercially refined palm oils. Further, the predominant formation mechanism of monochloropropanediol (MCPD) diesters at high temperatures (>170-180°C) was revealed. The present study involved the development and comparison of solutions to mitigate MCPD diester levels in oils from various stages of palm oil production. Partially refined palm oil samples and oil extracted from fresh palm fruits were submitted to bench-top deodorisation experiments. Application of glycerol and ethanol as refining aids during the deodorisation of refined-bleached palm oil proved to be moderately effective; about 25%-35% reduction of MCPD diester levels was achieved. Washing crude palm oil with ethanol-water (1:1) prior to deodorisation was also an effective strategy yielding an ∼30% reduction of MCPD diester contents. Washing palm fruit pulp before oil extraction, however, was most impactful, resulting in a 95% reduction of MCPD diesters when compared to the deodorised control oil. This suggests that intervention upstream in the process chain is most efficient in reducing levels of these contaminants in refined oils. Following the study, a root-cause analysis was performed in order to map the parameters potentially responsible for the occurrence of MCPD diesters in refined palm oil and related fractions.","Food additives & contaminants.

21995762,"This paper reports new insights at the molecular level into the route of a worldwide problem of the food industry: the occurrence of monochloro-propanediol (MCPD) esters. The application of mass defect-driven workflows is described to generate a hypothesis on the identity and occurrence of those thermally labile, chlorinated contaminant precursors that may act as chlorine donors during the formation of MCPD esters. For the first time, holistic mass-defect filtering of isotope signatures is used to pinpoint completely unknown and unexpected chlorine-containing substances naturally present in various extracts of palm fruit and partially and fully refined oils. Supervised multivariate analysis showed the effective classification of samples from various stages of industrial processing, suggesting that these steps strongly impact a complex and dynamic pool of chlorinated substances. In-vitro experiments confirmed that several of these naturally occurring chlorinated plant constituents decompose upon heat treatment, thus potentially being a source of chlorine for further reactions with palm oil lipids in a subsequent chlorination cascade. It is hypothesised that during oil refining the organochlorines naturally present in palm fruits act as a 'chlorine source' for the generation MCPD diesters. This discovery implies that industrial efforts targeting the mitigation of chlorinated substances must intervene at the earliest possible production stage or preferably even prior to oil processing. Current performance and limitations of mass-defect filtering are discussed and future developments are outlined.","Food additives & contaminants.

In addition, the number of molting process in crabs compounds further the amount of waste shell generated. As such, in the present work, the application of the waste crab shell as a source of CaO in transesterification of palm olein to biodiesel (methyl ester) was investigated. Preliminary XRD results revealed that thermally activated crab shell contains mainly CaO. Parametric study has been investigated and optimal conditions were found to be methanol/oil mass ratio, 0.5:1; catalyst amount, 4 wt. %; and reaction temperature, 338 K. As compared to laboratory CaO, the catalyst from waste crab shell performs well, thus creating another low-cost catalyst source for producing biodiesel as well as adding value to the waste crab shell.

PAHs were measured in three oils (olive pomace, sunflower and coconut oil). Five samples of each oil (one unfortified, and four fortified at concentrations between 2 and 50 microg kg(-1)) were analysed in replicate (four times in separate runs). Two samples (one unfortified and one fortified at 2 microg kg(-1)) of five oils (virgin olive oil, grapeseed oil, toasted sesame oil, olive margarine and palm oil) were also analysed. The validation included an assessment of measurement bias from the results of 120 measurements of a certified reference material (coconut oil BCR CRM458 certified for six PAHs). The method is capable of reliably detecting 26 out of 27 PAHs, at concentration <2 microg kg(-1) which is the European Union maximum limit for benzo[a]pyrene, in vegetable oils, olive pomace oil, sunflower oil and coconut oil. Quantitative results were obtained that are fit for purpose for concentrations from <2 to 50 microg kg(-1) for 24 out of 27 PAHs in olive pomace oil, sunflower oil and coconut oil. The reliable detection of 2 microg kg(-1) of PAHs in five additional oils (virgin olive oil, grapeseed oil, toasted sesame oil, olive margarine and palm oil) has been demonstrated. The method failed to produce fit-for-purpose results for the measurement of dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, anthanthrene and cyclopenta[c,d]pyrene. The reason for the failure was the large variation in results.

These materials are currently disposed of in landfills and could potentially have a negative impact on the effective function of microbes that are intolerant of acidic conditions. A study was undertaken using three different sources of acid waste bentonites, namely soybean oil bentonite (SB), palm oil bentonite (PB), and rice bran oil bentonite (RB). These materials were co-composted with rice husk, rice husk ash, and chicken litter to eliminate their acid reactivity and hydrophobic nature. The organic carbon (OC) content, pH, exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the acid-activated bentonites increased significantly after the co-composting phase. In addition, the hydrophobic nature of these materials as measured using the water drop penetration time (WDPT) decreased from >10 800 s to 16 to 80 s after composting. Furthermore, these composted materials showed positive impacts on soil physical attributes including specific surface area, bulk density, and available water content for crop growth. Highly significant increases in maize biomass (Zea mays L.) production over two consecutive cropping cycles was observed in treatments receiving co-composted bentonite. The study clearly demonstrates the potential for converting an environmentally hazardous material into a high-quality soil conditioner using readily available agricultural byproducts.

15081990,"It has been known for a long time that both the crystal structure and kinetics of crystallisation can be affected by ultrasound. In the past systems used have relied on high power ultrasonic probes to produce crystals. The majority of these probes produce cavitation in the system and it has been difficult to differentiate between effects caused by the ultrasound alone or by the cavitation produced by ultrasound on the crystal structure. Some materials, such as fats, are very susceptible to the production of free radicals that lead to ""off-flavours"" being obtained. These ""off-flavours"" are easily produced when the standard high power probes are used. This has meant that, although the crystal structure of the final product might be improved, the presence of 'off' flavours has prevented ultrasound being considered as a commercial technique for the crystallisation of edible fats. At Unilever R&D a system has been developed which can investigate the effect of ultrasound on the crystallisation of fats under controlled conditions covering a range of intensities and cooling rates. The intensity levels used were both below and above the cavitational threshold. By keeping the cooling regime constant it has been possible to show that the structure of the final product can vary from a material looking similar to cottage cheese through to a fine cream simply by varying the ultrasonic intensity.

12670187,"The content of phytosterol oxidation products was determined in samples of crude vegetable oils: peanut, sunflower, maize, palm nut, and lampante olive oils that were intended for refining and not for direct consumption. The 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxy derivatives of beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol and the 7-keto-beta-sitosterol were the principal phytosterol oxides found in almost all of the oils analyzed. In some oils, the epoxy and dihydroxy derivatives of beta-sitosterol were also found at very low levels. The highest total concentrations of phytosterol oxides, ranging from 4.5 to 67.5 and from 4.1 to 60.1 ppm, were found in sunflower and maize oils, respectively. Lower concentrations were present in the peanut oils, 2.7-9.6 ppm, and in the palm nut oil, 5.5 ppm, whereas in the lampante olive oils, only three samples of the six analyzed contained a low concentration (1.5-2.5 ppm) of oxyphytosterols. No detectable levels of phytosterol oxides were found in the samples of palm and coconut oils. Bleaching experiments were carried out on a sample of sunflower oil at 80 degrees C for 1 h with 1 and 2% of both acidic and neutral earths. The bleaching caused a reduction of the hydroxyphytosterol with partial formation of steroidal hydrocarbons with three double bonds in the ring system at the 2-, 4-, and 6-positions (steratrienes). The same sunflower oil was deodorized at 180 degrees C under vacuum for 1 h, and no dehydration products were formed with a complete recovery of the hydroxyphytosterols. A bleaching test with acidic earths was carried out also with an extra virgin olive oil fortified with 7-keto-cholesterol, dihydroxycholesterol, and alpha-epoxy-cholesterol.

The objective of the present study was to measure the in vitro accessibility (available for absorption) of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene in vegetable relishes prepared with or without oil. Derived results were used to calculate the contribution of vegetable relish to recommended daily intake of retinol. Five sundried green leafy vegetables from Tanzania were cooked without oil, with sunflower oil or with red palm oil. The total amount and in vitro accessibility of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene from a portion (100 g) of vegetable relish was determined. The in vitro method used simulated the digestion process in the gastrointestinal tract. Carotenoids released after digestion were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The total amount of beta-carotene varied between 1211 and 3659 microg/100 g among the five vegetable sources studied. From green leaves cooked without oil, 8-29% of the beta-carotene content became accessible after in vitro digestion and 39-94% from leaves cooked with sunflower oil or red palm oil. Adding red palm oil instead of sunflower oil resulted in about twice as much accessible beta-carotene, due to the high accessibility of its beta-carotene content. The red palm oil contributed also a considerable amount of alpha-carotene.

11943637,"This paper focuses on changes in vitamin A (VA) intakes as part of the evaluation of a pilot project on social marketing of red palm oil (RPO) as a VA supplement for mothers and children in central-north Burkina Faso. The objectives of the 30-month project are to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of introducing RPO in non-consuming areas. RPO is collected from women in the South-West region and it is sold in project sites by village volunteers. RPO is promoted by community workers trained in persuasive communication and social marketing. The target population is free to buy and consume RPO. Evaluation design includes data collected at onset, then 12 and 24 months later, from the same sample of 210 mothers and their children randomly selected in seven project sites. Children were 1 to 3 years old at onset. Blood samples were collected at baseline from mothers and children for serum retinol determination by HPLC. VA intakes are estimated by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, using the conventional beta-carotene to retinol conversion factors and the newly revised lower factors. VA deficiency is a major public health problem in the area: 64% of mothers and 85% of children had serum retinol concentrations < 0,70 mumol/l at baseline. VA came mainly from plant foods, particularly fruits and dark green vegetables which provided more than 90% of the dietary VA at onset of the project. Mean vitamin A intakes are low. We found 138 106 mug ER for the children and 302 +/- 235 microg ER for the mothers with conventional factors and 64 +/- 58 microg ER and 133 +/- 162 microg ER, respectively, with the revised factors. One year later, one third of respondents had consumed RPO in the previous week, and it supplied around 56% of the VA intake of children and 67% of mothers (36% and 46% respectively for the whole group). VA intakes were significantly increased at 510 +/- 493 microg ER and 801 +/- 913 microg ER for the children and their mothers respectively (347 +/- 443 microg ER and 568 +/- 803 microg ER respectively, with the revised factors). Analyzing serum retinol and dietary data collected at baseline, it was found that VA intakes < 62,5% of safe level of intake were highly sensitive to low serum retinol (< 0,70 micromol/l) and using revised conversion factors to assess total VA intake slightly enhanced sensitivity. The proportion of mothers and children at risk of inadequate VA intake changed from nearly 100% at baseline to 60% one year later. The results show that promoting RPO (and other VA rich foods) was effective in improving VA intakes. This improvement will hopefully be sustained and even further enhanced during the remaining 12 months of the project, after which repeated measurement of serum retinol and VA intakes will allow the actual impact of the project to be truly assessed.","Sante (Montrouge, France)","['D000328', 'D002050', 'D002675', 'D002851', 'D004042', 'D019587', 'D005260', 'D006293', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D008137', 'D008297', 'D000073878', 'D010938', 'D011795', 'D014801', 'D014802']","['Adult', 'Burkina Faso', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Palm Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency']",[Changes in vitamin A intake following the social marketing of red palm oil among children and women in Burkina Faso].,"[None, 'Q000453', None, None, 'Q000008', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000008', 'Q000178']","[None, 'epidemiology', None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'administration & dosage', 'diet therapy']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11943637,2002

3401476,"Mice of the GR/A strain were fed four different isocaloric semipurified diets, enriched in either (1) saturated fatty acids (palm oil), or (2) polyunsaturated fatty acids (corn oil), or (3) palm oil plus cholesterol, or (4) a fat-poor diet containing only a minimal amount of essential fatty acids. We have studied the effects of these dietary lipids on the density profile and composition of the plasma lipoproteins and on the lipid composition and fluidity of (purified) lymphoid cell membranes in healthy mice and in mice bearing a transplanted lymphoid leukemia (GRSL). Tumor development in these mice occurred in the spleen and in ascites. While the fatty acid composition of the VLDL-triacylglycerols still strongly resembled the dietary lipids, the effects of the diets decreased in the order VLDL-triacylglycerols greater than HDL-phospholipids greater than plasma membrane phospholipids. Diet-induced differences in the latter fraction were virtually confined to the content of oleic acid and linoleic acid, and they were too small to affect the membrane fluidity, as measured by fluorescence polarization using the probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Healthy mice were almost irresponsive to dietary cholesterol, but in the tumor bearers, where lipoprotein metabolism has been shown to be disturbed, the cholesterol diet caused a substantial increase in the low- and very-low density regions of both blood and ascites plasma lipoproteins. The cholesterol-rich diet also increased the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio and lipid structural order (decreased fluidity) in GRSL ascites cell membranes, but not in the splenic GRSL cell membranes. We conclude that the composition of plasma lipoproteins and cell membrane lipids in GR/A mice is subject to exquisite homeostatic control. However, in these low-responders to dietary lipids the development of an ascites tumor may lead to increased responsiveness to dietary cholesterol. The elevated level of membrane cholesterol thus obtained in GRSL ascites cells did not affect the expression of various cell surface antigens or tumor cell growth.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,"['D000818', 'D001202', 'D002462', 'D002784', 'D004041', 'D004161', 'D005227', 'D007942', 'D008074', 'D008075', 'D008079', 'D008297', 'D008560', 'D008563', 'D051379', 'D009368', 'D013050', 'D013154']","['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cholesterol', 'Dietary Fats', 'Diphenylhexatriene', 'Fatty Acids', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lipoproteins', 'Lipoproteins, HDL', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL', 'Male', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spleen']",Effect of dietary lipids on plasma lipoproteins and fluidity of lymphoid cell membranes in normal and leukemic mice.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000097', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'blood', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3401476,1988

Rats fed a palm oil diet had higher serum triacylglycerol levels at 7 AM, before the meal (1.96 +/- 0.25 mM vs. 1.09 +/- 0.09 mM) and reached higher levels postprandially (4.32 +/- 0.48 mM vs. 2.87 +/- 0.18 mM) than sunflower seed oil-fed animals, due to higher levels of hepatic VLDL (at 7 AM) and higher levels of chylomicrons and hepatic VLDL (in the postprandial phase). These differences in serum triacylglycerol concentrations between the diets tested were found not to be due to differences in hepatic VLDL triacylglycerol secretion (similar rate for both dietary groups and not very much affected by meal consumption) or chylomicron triacylglycerol secretion (similar response profiles on both diets), pointing towards differences in plasma triacylglycerol catabolism. Subsequent double-label studies on triacylglycerol catabolism of chylomicrons from palm oil- and sunflower seed oil-fed animals in chow-fed recipients showed that palm oil triacyglycerol is catabolized slower than sunflower seed oil triacylglycerol. Furthermore, activities of postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase tended to be higher in sunflower seed oil-fed animals. From these data we conclude that the relative hypertriglyceridemia found in palm oil-fed animals is due to less efficient catabolism and not to increased synthesis of plasma triacylglycerol.",Journal of lipid research,"['D000818', 'D002850', 'D002914', 'D004041', 'D004042', 'D005502', 'D008079', 'D008196', 'D008297', 'D000073878', 'D010938', 'D051381', 'D011919', 'D000074242', 'D014280']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chylomicrons', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL', 'Lymph', 'Male', 'Palm Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sunflower Oil', 'Triglycerides']",Effect of dietary fat composition on the metabolism of triacylglycerol-rich plasma lipoproteins in the postprandial phase in meal-fed rats.,"[None, None, 'Q000097', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000494', None, None, None, 'Q000097']","[None, None, 'blood', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', None, 'blood', 'metabolism', None, None, 'pharmacology', None, None, None, 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3411234,1988
