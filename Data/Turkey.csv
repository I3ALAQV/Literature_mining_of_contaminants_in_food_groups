35030475,"The objective of this work was to develop a quantitative multi-residue method for analysing antiviral drug residues and their metabolites in poultry meat samples. Antiviral drugs are not licensed for the treatment of influenza in food producing animals. However, there have been some reports indicating their illegal use in poultry. In this study, a method was developed for the analysis of 15 antiviral drug residues in poultry muscle (chicken, duck, quail and turkey) using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This included 13 drugs against influenza and associated metabolites, but also two drugs employed for the treatment of herpes (acyclovir and ganciclovir). The method required the development of a novel chromatographic separation using a hydrophilic interaction chromatographic (HILIC) BEH amide column, which was necessary to retain the highly polar compounds. The analytes were detected using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in positive electrospray ionization mode. A range of different sample preparation protocols suitable for polar compounds were evaluated. The most effective procedure was based on a simple acetonitrile-based protein precipitation step followed by a further dilution in a methanol/water solution. The confirmatory method was validated according to the EU 2021/808 guidelines on different species including chicken, duck, turkey and quail. The validation was performed using various calibration curves ranging from 0.1 µg kg",Journal of chromatography.

35011349,"In this study, the botanical origin, total flavonoid and phenolic content, antioxidant activity, phenolic profile and fatty acid composition of mixed bee pollen loads collected in Bayburt, Turkey, were determined. In addition to these assays, antibacterial activity of bee-collected pollen extract (BCPE) against a variety of food-borne pathogenic bacteria was determined in vitro. Pollen loads were classified into five botanical families based on their color: Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Campanulaceae, Cistaceae and Rosaceae. Total flavonoid, total phenolic, CUPRAC and CERAC concentrations were 173.52 mg GAE/g, 79.21 mg QE/g, 85.59 mg Trolox/g and 118.13 mg Trolox/g, respectively. Twenty-three phenolic compounds were scanned in bee pollen extract by LC-MS/MS, with rutin being the most abundant. Cis-4,7,10,13,16,19 docosahexaenoic acid was the predominant fatty acid, followed by cis-11-eicosenoic acid, palmitic acid, and alfa linolenic acid. In addition, the agar well diffusion (AWD) and micro-broth dilution methods were used to determine of the antibacterial activity of the BCPE sample. MIC values were observed to vary between 2.5-5 mg/mL for Gram-positive bacteria and 5-10 mg/mL for Gram-negative bacteria.

This study focused on the causes of soil and water contamination and the potential impact of drinking water on community health. Reasons for metal(loid)s enrichment in the water and soil in the Söke Basin were examined by considering anthropogenic and geogenic inputs. Four rock samples in the drainage network, 28 soil samples, and 29 water samples in the Söke Plain were collected. All samples were analyzed for metal(loid)s by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects of water on human health were calculated mathematically. Potential ecological risk index (PERI), enrichment factor (EF), and ecological risk (ER) were calculated for the soil samples. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation and Kaiser normalization was applied to the soil data set. Cr, Ni, and Cd contamination in soils was associated with anthropogenic inputs, while arsenic contamination was related to both anthropogenic and geogenic inputs. As, B, Ba, Pb, and Sb contamination was found in some drinking water. As contamination has been clearly found to be caused by natural geological processes in and around Lake Azap. It was determined that metal(loid)s enrichment occurred in drinking water due to the mixing of geothermal waters affected by seawater intrusion with surface and groundwater.

The enrichment factor of the selected elements in the soil, moss, and deposition samples was calculated. The highest enrichments were found for Lead in atmospheric deposition, Arsenic in soil, and Mercury in moss samples. Cobalt and chromium accumulated more in mosses than in soil. Elevated arsenic levels found in the samples can pose a great risk for public health and agriculture. The study result showed that the elemental composition of the samples was influenced by the enhanced air plume dispersion of anthropogenic pollution sources along the Northeast-Southwest directions due to wind characteristics in the province.

The rapid and accurate identification of the members of Acb complex is critical as these nosocomial pathogens can show differences in antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical outcomes. The conventional phenotypic methods are slow, unreliable and less efficient for the differentiation of Acb complex species, including the A.baumannii species within the Acb complex. Although various molecular methods are available, such as amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and blaOXA-51-like gene specific PCR, they are usually inconvenient for the routine diagnostic laboratories. Recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) offers an opportunity for rapid, cost-effective and convenient bacterial identification in routine diagnostic procedures conducted in clinical laboratory. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnosis performance of MALDI-TOF MS system to identify blood isolates of A.baumannii. A total of 180 nonduplicate carbapenem resistant Acb complex (strain numbers; TR1-TR60) and A.baumannii (TR61-TR180) blood isolates were collected from the intensive care units of the three university hospitals in Turkey from January 2016 to December 2016. All isolates were evaluated by using blaOXA-51-like gene specific real time (Rt-PCR) analysis, ARDRA (restriction enzymes-AluI, CfoI, MboI, MspI, RsaI) method and MALDI-TOF MS (VITEK® MS, bioMérieux, France) system. All the strains except TR10, TR31, TR35 and TR52 were identified as A.baumannii by ARDRA method. Out of 177 of all the isolates, presence of blaOXA-51-like gene was found except for TR10, TR31 and TR52 isolates. However, TR31 without the presence of blaOXA-51-like gene was identified as A.pittii using the ARDRA. Totally 176 isolates which were identified as A.baumannii by both of the methods, ARDRA and Rt-PCR- blaOXA-51-like, were accepted as a reference for the evaluation of the diagnosis performance capacity of the MALDI-TOF MS. Overall, for all 176 isolates tested, the sensitivity obtained with the MALDI-TOF MS were 99.4% with 75% specificity. The accuracy value of the method was determined as 98.9% for the identification of A.baumannii to the species level. MALDI-TOF MS is increasingly used in diagnostic microbiology for the routine identification of bacteria to the genus, species or subspecies level with high rates of sensitivity and specificity. In future, by expanding the database, MALDI-TOF MS system would possibly become the ideal method for routine diagnostic laboratories that could potentially identify more species and even determine some characteristics of antimicrobial resistance and virulence determinants.",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,"['D000151', 'D040981', 'D001431', 'D006801', 'D060888', 'D019032', 'D014421']","['Acinetobacter Infections', 'Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Bacteriological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Turkey']","[The Identification of Acinetobacter baumannii Blood Isolates by MALDI-TOF MS, ARDRA and blaOXA-51-like Gene-Specific Real-Time PCR].","['Q000175', 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, None]","['diagnosis', 'genetics', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33107283,2021

32755517,"Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC), a large group of anaerobic bacteria, are the members of the normal microbiota that colonizes the skin and mucosal surfaces of the human body. However, in case of a wound or when the host becomes immunocompromised, GPAC can cause invasive and most frequently mixed infections. GPAC are the second most frequently isolated bacteria in anaerobic infections. Although the studies are limited, GPAC have been reported to develop resistance to antimicrobial drugs. The resistance of the pathogens to the antimicrobials and improper therapy can cause poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, monitoring of the resistance trends of regional clinically important anaerobic bacteria periodically is recommended. In our study, we aimed to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinically important GPAC. A total of 100 non-duplicated pathogenic GPAC isolates were collected from Marmara University Hospital between 2013 and 2015. The isolates were identified by using conventional methods, ""matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry system (MALDI-TOF MS)"" (VITEK MS; v3.0, bioMerieux, France) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was carried out by the agar dilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The following antimicrobials were tested: penicillin, amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid (AMC), cefoxitin, meropenem, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, tigecycline, chloramphenicol, moxifloxacin and metronidazole. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results were interpreted according to the breakpoints described by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Breakpoints recommended by CLSI for cefoxitin, tetracycline and moxifloxacin, and breakpoint recommended by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for tigecycline were used since there were no EUCAST breakpoints for these antimicrobials. MIC50 and MIC90 values were determined for erythromycin since the breakpoint was not described by EUCAST, CLSI or FDA guidelines. The identification results showed that the strains (n= 100) consisted of five different GPAC genus; Parvomonas (40%), Finegoldia (34%), Peptoniphilus (14%), Peptostreptococcus (10%) and Anaerococcus (1%). All of the organisms were susceptible to meropenem, tigecycline and metronidazole. The isolates were highly susceptible to penicillin, AMC, cefoxitin, and chloramphenicol, since the resistance rates against these antimicrobials were 5% or less. The resistance rates against clindamycin, tetracycline and moxifloxacin were 14%, 31% and 24%, respectively. In total, 11% of the isolates were multidrug resistant. Metronidazole and tigecycline displayed high in vitro activity against GPAC and both are appropriate antimicrobials for the selection of empiric therapy. The effectiveness of meropenem was also found high, but it was observed that this antimicrobial would be more appropriate to use in the treatment of severe mixed infections accompanied by other microorganisms with the resistance potential. Detection of penicillin and AMC resistant isolates, which are frequently used in the treatment of GPAC infection, requires periodic monitoring of the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of GPAC. The high rates of resistance against clindamycin, tetracycline and moksifloxacin indicated that these antimicrobials should not be used for empirical treatment of infections without prior antimicrobial susceptibility testing. This study is one of the largest susceptibility studies specifically carried out on GPAC to date in Turkey.

Thus, m-PCR and MALDI-TOF MS were able to detect A. butzleri significantly better than the conventional method (χ2 = 49.1 and P < 0.001). Arcobacter was isolated from poultry in every season, at contamination levels of 30.76, 23.07, 19.23, and 26.92% in summer, spring, autumn, and winter, respectively. The disk diffusion method was used to determine the susceptibility of Arcobacter isolates to six antimicrobial drugs. All A. butzleri isolates (n = 24) were significantly resistant to erythromycin (P = 0.0015), ampicillin (P = 0.001), and ciprofloxacin (P = 0.05). All tested A. cryaerophilus strains (n = 4) were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Multidrug resistance was observed in 83% of the Arcobacter spp. isolates. Our study detected Arcobacter spp. in Tunisian poultry; because of their multidrug resistance, these species may constitute a public health problem.",Journal of food protection,"['D000818', 'D020640', 'D004352', 'D005516', 'D011200', 'D014416']","['Animals', 'Arcobacter', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Food Microbiology', 'Poultry', 'Tunisia']",Occurrence and Antibiotic Resistance of Arcobacter Species Isolates from Poultry in Tunisia.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32634222,2021
32621108,"The aim of this study was to determine dietary exposure to ochratoxin A (OTA) in Turkish adults. In this study, 500 food samples (50 rice, 50 wheat bread, 50 pasta, 50 raisins, 50 dried figs, 50 pistachios, 50 hazelnuts, 50 almonds, 50 chilli, 25 coffee, and 25 cocoa) collected from Turkey were analysed with a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Moreover, a total of 370 analytical results (110 cereal-based snacks, 95 wine, 35 beer, and 130 chocolate) collected from our previous observations were also used in the evaluation of exposure estimates. OTA was found in 52% of cocoa, 42% of raisins, 40% of coffee, 34% of chilli, 14% of dried figs, 10% of pasta, 8% of pistachios, 6% of wheat bread, 4% of rice, and 4% of hazelnuts. The chronic dietary exposure to OTA for Turkish adults, using lower bound (LB) and upper bound (UB) concentrations, varied from 0.683 to 4.487 ng/kg body weight (b.w.) per week for mean estimate and from 3.976 to 5.760 ng/kg b.w. per week for the 95th percentile (P95) estimate. Cereals and cereal-based products made the largest contribution (75.3-85.7%) to OTA exposure.

32597129,"Valeriana is a common plant species used for various healing purposes in folk medicine since antiquity. This study investigates the phytochemical profile, antioxidant, cytotoxic, and insecticidal activity of Valeriana alliariifolia Adams, a species that has traditionally been used in Turkey. For the analyses we prepared four root extracts of V. alliariifolia Adams using hexane (HM1), chloroform (CM1), ethanol (EM1), and water (WM1) for maceration. Additionally, two extracts were also prepared from its roots by maceration separately with ethanol (EM2) and water (WM2). One sample was prepared as a water infusion (WI), according to the procedure used in Turkish traditional medicine. The 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical cation scavenging activity tests showed that ethanol extracts had the strongest antioxidant activity: EM1 (IC50 - DPPH: 17.694 µg/mL; ABTS: 23.8 µg/mL) and EM2 (IC50 - DPPH: 20 µg/mL; ABTS: 21.5 µg/mL). The hexane extract, HM1, was the most cytotoxic (IC50<10 µg/mL against HepG2 and HUVEC) and EM2 strongly cytotoxic (IC50<10 µg/mL against HepG2 and IC50: 11.96 µg/mL against HUVEC). The extracts with demonstrated cytotoxic activities were further examined to check their insecticidal activity against adult female mosquito Aedes aegypti and first instar Ae. aegypti larvae. HM1 was the most effective (90±10 %), which was consistent with its cytotoxic activity. Because of the high antioxidant, cytotoxic, and insecticidal activities, we ran phytochemical analyses of the HM1, EM1, and EM2 extracts with GC-MS (for HM1) and LC-MS/MS (for EM1 and EM2). We also analysed the composition of the essential oil obtained from V. alliariifolia roots by micro-distillation in order to compare its content with HM1, which contains volatile compounds. Phytochemical analyses revealed that the major compound in HM1 was isovaleric acid (16 %) and in the essential oil 1,8-cineole (2.9 %). EM1 and EM2 contained 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid), verbascoside (acteoside), and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid as major components. In the light of our findings and available literature, we can conclude that V. alliariifolia has a good bioactive potential that could be used for different purposes, including the development of new agents for the treatment of various diseases. The difference in the content between the essential oil and HM1 was remarkable. It suggests that the variability observed in the activity of the samples was a result of composition and that, therefore, the aim of treatment should dictate which type of preparation is to be selected. An added value of our study is that it determined verbascoside and methylquercetin rutinoside for the first time in the Valeriana extracts.",Arhiv za higijenu rada i toksikologiju,"['D029023', 'D000975', 'D002853', 'D003603', 'D007306', 'D009822', 'D010936', 'D053719', 'D014421', 'D014632']","['Acorus', 'Antioxidants', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cytotoxins', 'Insecticides', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Plant Extracts', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Turkey', 'Valerian']","Chemical composition and antioxidant, cytotoxic, and insecticidal potential of Valeriana alliariifolia in Turkey.","['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32597129,2020
32554271,"Human exposure to non-essential toxic metals such as cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb), and metalloids such as arsenic (As) commonly occurs through diet. Toxic trace element exposures have been reported in association with fertility and fecundity in epidemiologic studies even at low to moderate levels. While most previous studies employed blood and urine biomarkers of exposure, few have assessed toxic trace elements in ovarian follicular fluid (FF), which surrounds the developing oocyte and hence may better reflect concentrations potentially affecting reproductive outcomes. Our objective was to identify dietary predictors of FF toxic trace elements in n = 56 women (mean age: 38.3 years) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) at the University of California at San Francisco. We determined As, Hg, Cd, and Pb in 197 FF specimens, collected on the day of oocyte retrieval, using inductively coupled plasma tandem mass spectrometry. A comprehensive food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the weekly and annual dietary ""patterns"" of participants. Consumption of specific seafood items and turkey were correlated with individual FF toxic trace elements. We also found that each unit higher seafood consumption in the past week dominated by mollusks, shrimp, and bass was associated with 60% higher FF As (95% confidence interval (CI): 25%, 105%) and FF Hg (95%CI: 7%, 136%) concentrations. Higher annual seafood consumption dominated by urchin, crab, and trout was associated with 16% higher FF As (95%CI: -2%, 38%) and 31% higher FF Hg (95%CI: 7%, 60%) concentrations per unit intake. No associations were noted between diet and Cd and Pb levels in FF. Overall, our results suggest that higher seafood consumption contributes to elevated levels of As and Hg in FF. These findings are consistent with previous IVF studies that assessed toxic trace element exposures in blood and urine. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that diet might be a source of As, Hg, Cd, and Pb in FF.",Environmental research,"['D000328', 'D000818', 'D001151', 'D002104', 'D005260', 'D005307', 'D015571', 'D006801', 'D008628', 'D017747']","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Cadmium', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Follicular Fluid', 'Humans', 'Mercury', 'Seafood']",Seafood consumption is associated with higher follicular fluid arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg) concentrations in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF).,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32554271,2020

It is known that some PAHs, which can pass to air, soil, water and food as a result of natural or anthropogenic processes, have carcinogenic, toxic and mutagenic effects on humans and animals. One of the important steps that is identified in the transition takes place during agricultural production. Greenhouses are commonly used as a type of agricultural production especially during the winter season in mid and temperate climates. Greenhouse cultivation is abundant in Antalya Aksu Region in Turkey. Two sampling campaigns (autumn and winter) were carried out to sample the soils in 53 glass and polyethylene covered greenhouses. The samples were analysed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for 16 PAHs. The result showed that four ring PAHs were dominant in the region. In the winter season, PAHs concentrations increase because of low volatility of motor vehicle exhaust related PAHs in the atmosphere and of coal and wood combustion emissions used in the heating of greenhouses and surrounding village houses.

We present sets of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, which turned out to be the source of 105 heat-stable peptides, detectable in processed meat using LC-MS/MS. A list of heat-stable species-specific peptides was compiled for eleven types of white and red meat including chicken, duck, goose, turkey, pork, beef, lamb, rabbit, buffalo, deer, and horse meat, which can be used as markers for meat authentication. Among the 105 peptides, 57 were verified by multiple reaction monitoring, enabling identification of each species with high specificity and selectivity. The most described and monitored species by LC-MS/MS so far are chicken and pork with 26 confirmed heat-stable peptide markers for each meat.

30622022,"Antibiotics are important contaminants that have become an increasingly big problem due to the discharge of the receiving environment. The presence of these organic based pollutants in influent wastewater can inhibit the biological processes and resist to degradation in wastewater treatment plants. Moreover, the consumption of agricultural products, irrigated with water containing antibiotic residues, leads to major harmful effects to the human body through the food chain. In this study; firstly, a conventional characterization was made in terms of COD, TOC, SS, color and of antibiotic residue characterization of untreated raw (influent) and biologically treated (effluent) water from domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants located in the Meriç-Ergene Basin. After that, photocatalytic activity test was run under visible light for selected antibiotics (Erythromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Sulphametoxasol) which were detected by HPLC MS/MS in excess amount. Finally, for the photocatalytic oxidation, a new generation NFC (Nitrogen-Floride-Carbon)-doped titanium dioxide photocatalyst, which has never been studied in the literature before, was prepared according to the sol-gel method without using thermal processing. Photocatalysts were characterized by UV-vis DRS reflectance and Laser Raman Spectra measurements. All other analyzes were made according to the standard methods. Considering the conventional characterization results; investigated domestic wastewaters exhibited moderate characteristics while industrial wastewater samples had strong characteristics in terms of COD, TOC and SS pollution in accordance with the literature. By the way, contrary to expectations, antibiotic residue results have proved that the effluent wastewater contains more antibiotics than the influent. This can be explained by the fact that, some antibiotics in domestic wastewaters are probably already trapped in feces and cannot be purified by conventional systems since they are released after biological treatment, as mentioned similar studies in the literature. Moreover, by means of 7 h NFC-doped photocatalytic oxidation under visible light, beside approximately % 62 to %79 COD and 62%-86% TOC removal, %99 to %100 removal of antibiotic residue was provided.

Both of the studied Stereum methanol extracts were determined as the most active in β-carotene-linoleic acid, DPPR, ABTS·+, and CUPRAC assays; the n-hexane extracts were found to be most active in metal chelating and AChE inhibitory activity assays. In addition, the methanol extract of S. sanguinolentum (IC50: 34.26 ± 0.31 μg/mL) showed higher ABTS·+ scavenging activity than α-tocopherol (IC50: 38.51 ± 0.54 μg/mL).

30579243,"Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) is one of the world's oldest medicinal plants which are widely used for medicinal, nutritive and scientific purposes. Turkey is one of the major legal opium poppy producer countries in the world and the seed paste of the poppies is consumed in great deal, even more than 100g per meal. The main objective of this study is to investigate the influence of poppy seed paste ingestion on urine tests for opiates whether or not could lead to opiate positive urine test results. For this purpose, a variety of poppies were used and the morphine content of white, yellow and blue-black poppies were determined as 1.9, 4.0 and 2.6mg/kg, respectively. 100g of these seed pastes were consumed in the breakfast by ten healthy adults enrolled in the study over three days and urine samples were collected before and after the breakfast. Opiate screening analysis was carried out by enzyme immunoassay method and the results were evaluated by two different cut-off values (300 and 2000ng/mL). Morphine confirmation analysis was made by GC-MS system and the chromatographic method was validated in terms of selectivity, extraction efficiency, linearity (25-2000ng/ml), intra-assay precision, accuracy, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) (3 and 10ng/ml), carryover, matrix effect, dilution integrity and stability. According to cut-off value 300ng/ml, opiate concentrations were found positive up to 48h. For cut-off value 2000ng/mL; this time was up to 12h in collected urine samples after consumption of three different colored poppy seed pastes. In all urine samples, thebaine was detected while the heroin abuse metabolite 6-acetyl morphine (6-AM) was not. Urine drug testing legislation was revised on 2016 in Turkey and opiate screening cut-off values increased from 300 to 2000ng/mL. Overall results have shown that poppy seed paste as food consumption could lead to opiate positive urine test result even if increased cut off levels are used. It can also be deduced that thebaine can be taken as supportive biomarker for poppy seed paste consumption.

30336375,"The genus Silene is renowned in Turkey for its traditional use as food and medicine. Currently, there are 138 species of Silene in Turkey, amongst which have been several studies for possible pharmacological potential and application in food industry. However, there is currently a paucity of data on Silene salsuginea Hub.-Mor. This study endeavours to access its antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, and anti-inflammatory properties. Besides, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (RP-HPLC-DAD) was used to detect phenolic compounds, and molecular docking was performed to provide new insights for tested enzymes and phenolics. High amounts of apigenin (534 μg/g extract), ferulic acid (452 μg/g extract), p-coumaric acid (408 μg/g extract), and quercetin (336 μg/g extract) were detected in the methanol extract while rutin (506 μg/g extract) was most abundant in the aqueous extract. As for their biological properties, the methanol extract exhibited the best antioxidant effect in the DPPH and CUPRAC assays, and also the highest inhibition against tyrosinase. The aqueous extract was the least active enzyme inhibitor but showed the highest antioxidant efficacy in the ABTS, FRAP, and metal chelating assays. At a concentration of 15.6 μg/mL, the methanol extract resulted in a moderate decrease (25.1%) of NO production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells. Among the phenolic compounds, epicatechin, (+)-catechin, and kaempferol showed the highest binding affinity towards the studied enzymes in silico.

Rapid and accurate identification of Prevotella isolates plays a critical role in successful treatment, especially since the antibiotic susceptibility profile differs between species. Studies, mostly carried out using the Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) Biotyper system, showed that MALDI-TOF MS is an accurate, rapid and satisfactory method for the identification of clinically important anaerobes. In this multi-center study, we assessed the performance of the MALDI-TOF MS VITEK MS system for the identification of clinical Prevotella isolates. A total of 508 Prevotella isolates, representing 19 different species, collected from 11 European countries, Kuwait and Turkey between January 2014 and April 2016, were identified using VITEK MS (v3.0). The reliability of the identification was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Using VITEK MS, 422 (83.1%) of the 508 isolates were identified on the species level, 459 (90.4%) on the genus level. A total of 49 (9.6%) isolates were not identified correctly. 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that this was partly due to the fact that several species were not represented in the database. However, some species that were represented in the database were also not identified.

It is unknown at present if the etiology of YSS also could be linked to low-molecular weight metabolites. The aim of this study was to examine the metabolome of white and yellow seminal plasma of turkeys. Two different metabolomics approaches, shotgun (direct infusion) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), were employed to identify metabolites differentially abundant in yellow seminal plasma. Significant changes in the levels of 1549 and 2093 metabolites were detected in yellow vs. white seminal plasma using shotgun and LC-MS, respectively. Of these, 354 metabolites (189 increased and 165 decreased) after shotgun and 936 metabolites (363 increased and 573 decreased) after LC-MS were putatively identified using the Human Metabolome Database. Significantly differentiated metabolites were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Lipid metabolism, molecular transport, and nucleic acid metabolism were the top pathways that differentiated white and yellow seminal plasma. These data strongly suggest that disturbance of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism is characteristic for YSS. The abnormal metabolism of lipids may contribute to the numerous lipid vacuoles previously observed in the reproductive tracts of YSS males. An increased level of riboflavin in YSS may be responsible for yellow turkey semen pigmentation.

This study reports the occurrence of Ochratoxin A (OTA) and associated fungal contamination in 35 samples of dried vine fruits imported in the European community potentially used for the development of new nutraceutical supplements. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis identified 18 samples as contaminated by OTA with an average level of 2.6 μg/kg. OTA was measured in 4 samples of currants (mean value of 6.6 μg/kg) and 13 samples of raisins (mean value of 1.4 μg/kg). In one sample of currants and one of raisins from Turkey OTA exceeded the limits set by European Commission of 10 μg/kg, being contaminated with 12.61 and 15.99 μg/kg, respectively. All the positive samples were confirmed by Orbitrap Q Exactive through their molecular weight and the corresponding fragmentation. The worldwide consumption of dried vine fruits contributed to OTA exposure in several group of consumers. In particular, considering the potential nutraceutical approach, this consumption may be represent a severe risk for healthy consumers that consider these products like healthy and salutistic for their contents in antioxidants, flavonoids, and polyphenols.

Commercial yogurts are produced using standard starters while, in the production of non-commercial yogurt, the microbiota is quite different since yogurts are used as starter for years. To determine the final characteristics of the fermented product it is necessary to know the biochemical properties of the starter cultures, such as acidity, aroma and flavor. This can only be achieved by identifying and characterizing the bacteria in starter cultures. In our study, 208 non-commercial yogurt samples were collected from 9 different locations in Anatolia, southern Turkey. Their pH and lactic acid bacteria profiles were analyzed. Isolated bacteria were identified by MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser sesorption-ionization time-of-flight, mass spectrometry), which is a fast and reliable method for identification of bacterial isolates compared to classical laboratory methods. In this study, 41% of the isolates were identified by using this method, which is 99.9% and 34.0% confidence. The isolates contained two genera (Enterococcus and Lactobacillus) and four species. Afterwards, the four lactic acid bacteria were characterized physiologically and biochemically and we found that they differed from lactic acid bacteria used in commercial yogurt production.

Concentrations of As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr, and V were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The method was validated prior to analysis in terms of linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), and recovery. In addition, a certified standard (SPS-SW2 surface water) was used to verify method trueness. Method validation data and results obtained from the certified material suggested that the method could be applied to determine elemental compositions of the samples. Although various concentrations of As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Sr were found in the samples, no Hg, V, Co, and Se concentrations were found. The highest concentration of Pb, Cd, and As was found in the samples from the 22nd, 16th, and 5th sampling stations, respectively.

Assessment of some heavy elements in sediment, water, fish (Chondrostoma regium) tissues, and some aquatic insects (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae) were carried out in June to August 2014. Heavy element levels in aquatic insect samples and their associated water and sediment were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometer. Fish tissues, from the same habitat, were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Eleven elements (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Hg, Pb) were measured in fish tissues, and 14 elements (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Br, Pb) were measured in insects. According to the results, it can be said that insects were contaminated by water and sediment, thus accumulated higher concentration of some elements than their environment. The fish, which was caught from Aşkale station, accumulates significantly higher level of heavy metals than Dumlu station's fish. The results were compared with national and international standards. The values of some heavy elements were found at higher concentration than the acceptable limits.

Equivalent results were observed at both time points (20 and 24 h) and in both atmospheres (microaerobic and aerobic) to reference methods. Method performance with chicken carcass rinse was confirmed in an independent laboratory study. Additionally, in robustness testing, small, deliberate changes to the assay parameters minimally affected ANSR method performance. Finally, accelerated stability results from three independently manufactured lots supported a shelf life of 6 months when stored at 4°C. The ANSR assay offered greater efficiency and flexibility when compared to the reference method with a 20-24 h single-step enrichment in a microaerobic or an aerobic atmosphere.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D000818', 'D002167', 'D002645', 'D008460', 'D012984', 'D013050', 'D013696', 'D014422']","['Animals', 'Campylobacter', 'Chickens', 'Meat', 'Software', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Temperature', 'Turkeys']",Validation of the ANSR® for ,"[None, 'Q000302', 'Q000382', 'Q000382', None, None, None, 'Q000382']","[None, 'isolation & purification', 'microbiology', 'microbiology', None, None, None, 'microbiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634328,2017
27311580,"Since waterborne minerals appear in ionic form and are readily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract, drinking water could be a crucial source of mineral intake. However, no comprehensive research has yet determined how trace elements in drinking water relate to body composition. We aimed to assess the relationship between clinically important trace elements in public drinking water and body composition in average, overweight and obese individuals in Turkey. The study's population consisted of 423 participants: 143 overweight, 138 obese and 142 healthy control individuals, grouped according to clinical cutoff points of body mass index (BMI). We measured levels of lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), silicon (Si), tin (Sn), strontium (Sr), boron (B), aluminium (Al), barium (Ba) and rubidium (Rb) in samples from wells of municipal water by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We gauged all the participants' body composition measurements with a BC-418 body composition analyser. In all the participants, body weight values showed significant positive correlations with Ni levels in drinking water, as did BMI values with Al levels and percentage of obesity with Ni, Si and B levels. In particular, Ni levels showed significant positive correlations with the basal metabolic rate, activity calories, and total activity of participants. Giving findings showing correlations between obesity-related parameters and Al, Si, B and Ni content in drinking water, we hope that these associations will be clarified with further studies including cellular, experimental and clinical studies.

Antioxidant activity of 3 cultivars of peaches grown in South Carolina was first evaluated by 3 antioxidant assays. The peach variety O'Henry showed the greatest antioxidant effect and therefore was used for further study. Two levels of peach skin powder (0.5%, 1%) and 0.01% butylated hydroxylanisole (BHA) were applied to ground turkey meat. Oxidation of cooked turkey meat was measured by detection of hexanal using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results indicated that all levels of peach skin powder used in this study had an antioxidant effect on ground turkey with a greater effect at the higher concentration.

27107652,"Human milk is an important source of beneficial nutrients and antibodies for newborns and infants and, under certain circumstances, its analysis may provide information on mothers' and infants' exposure to various contaminants. In the presented study, we have introduced the new analytical approach for analysis of 24 highly occurring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in this indicator matrix. The sample preparation procedure is based on an ethyl acetate extraction of milk; the transfer of analytes into an organic layer is enhanced by addition of inorganic salts, i.e. sodium chloride and magnesium sulphate. Following the clean-up of a crude extract on silica SPE columns, gas chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry is used for PAH identification and quantitation. The average recoveries of targeted PAHs from spiked samples were in the range of 68-110% with repeatabilities below 30% and method quantitation limits ranging from 0.03 to 0.3ng/g lipid weight. This newly validated method was successfully applied for analyses of 324 human milk samples collected from nonsmoking women during two sampling periods (summer and winter) in two residential areas in the Czech Republic differing in atmospheric pollution by PAHs. From 24 targeted analytes 17 were detected at least in one sample. Phenantherene, fluoranthrene, pyrene and fluorene were the most abundant compounds found at average concentration of 13.81, 1.80, 0.86, and 2.01ng/g lipid weight respectively. Comparing the data from two sampling periods, in both areas higher concentrations were measured in samples collected during winter. Also in the highly industrialized locality with heavily contaminated air PAH amounts in milk were higher than in the control locality.

The aim of this study was to determine the perchlorate levels in tap water from five cities in Turkey. Perchlorate concentrations of 145 tap water samples collected from Ankara, Isparta, Istanbul, Kayseri, and Sakarya were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Mean and median values were found to be 0.15 and 0.07 μg/L, respectively. The median values (25-75 % percentile) of Istanbul, Ankara, Sakarya, Isparta, and Kayseri were 0.08 μg/L (0.04-0.09 μg/L), 0.07 μg/L (0.07-0.21 μg/L), 0.04 μg/L (0.04-0.04 μg/L), 0.03 μg/L (0.02-0.07 μg/L), and 0.25 μg/L (0.23-0.31 μg/L), respectively. The median perchlorate level observed in Kayseri was significantly higher than those found at other cities (p < 0.05). Perchlorate concentrations in water samples were lower than the interim drinking water health advisory level (15 μg/L) determined by the US Environmental Protection Agency.

Data about the spread or prevalence in farm animals are missing. In this study, Trypton Soya Agar was modified to a selective medium enabling the isolation and quantification of S. gallolyticus from faecal samples. The bacterium was observed in 82 out of 91 faecal samples obtained from 18 different organic turkey flocks. The prevalence of shedding birds was estimated by the number of positive fresh droppings and reached up to 100% on most farms. Furthermore, for the first time S. gallolyticus was quantified in faeces from poultry flocks. The median of colony forming units (CFU) per gramme faeces was 3.6 x 10(5) CFU/g. Typing of one isolate from each positive faecal sample by multilocus sequence typing delivered 24 sequence types (STs). Most of the isolates belonged to the clonal complex CC58. The same STs of this complex were detected in up to six different flocks. Partly, these flocks were located in various regions and stocked with varying breeding lines. Regarding the biochemical profiles of the same STs from different farms, the results did not contradict a spread of specific STs in the organic turkey production.

A total of 75 samples were collected from different supermarkets and traditional bazaars in Istanbul during 2012-2013. OTA analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with fluorescence detection after immunoaffinity column clean-up. The method was linear in the range 0.05-40 μg kg(-1) (r(2) = 0.9997). Twenty-seven out of 31 (87.1%) packed red pepper flake samples contained OTA at concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 μg kg(-1), whereas 100% of the unpacked red pepper flake samples contained OTA, in the range 1.1-31.7 μg( )kg(-1). Overall, only 4 unpacked samples (5.3%) contained OTA, with a mean value of 23.4 μg kg(-1), which is higher than the European Union limit. It is suggested that OTA content should be carefully considered in red pepper flake samples especially marketed in unpacked form. ","Food additives & contaminants.

Naturally-occurring mussels were gathered along the coast of the Black Sea, Sea of Marmara, Bosphorus and Aegean Sea, while a 6-month transplantation session was implemented on the Levantine Sea coast where M. galloprovincialis does not adapt naturally. Mussels collected from the Izmir area were employed for transplantation to five locations along the Levantine Sea coast of Turkey. Concentrations of Ag, Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, V, and Zn were measured using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry). Results showed that concentrations of some essential elements (Co, Fe, K, Mn, Zn) generally fell within the range of acceptable global values. However, at some sampling sites the metal concentrations were found at higher levels compared to the world average and recommended limits. For instance, very high Ag and Cu concentrations were observed in mussel caged at Yumurtalık. Elevated As, Ni, Pb, and V concentrations were observed at the Tirebolu, Ereğli, Eskihisar, and Tekirdağ locations, respectively. Taking into account all measured metals, it can be inferred that Yumurtalık is the most metal-contaminated locality.

26064262,"There are conflicting reports on the correlation between manganese (Mn) levels and breast cancer. The purpose of the present study is to clarify the association between Mn levels and breast cancer using a meta-analysis approach. We searched articles indexed in Pubmed and the Chinese Journal Full-text Database (CJFD) published as of August 2014 that met our predefined criteria. Eleven eligible studies involving 1302 subjects were identified. Overall, pooled analysis indicated that subjects with breast cancer had lower Mn levels than the healthy controls (SMD = -1.51, 95% CI = [-2.47, -0.56]). Further subgroup analysis found a similar pattern in China (SMD = -1.32, 95% CI = [-2.33, -0.32]) and Korea (SMD = -4.08, 95% CI = [-4.63, -3.54]), but not in Turkey (SMD = -0.96, 95% CI = [-3.19, 1.27]). Further subgroup analysis also found a similar pattern in different sample specimens (serum: SMD = -1.24, 95% CI = [-2.31, -0.16]; hair: SMD = -1.99, 95% CI = [-3.91, -0.06]) and different types of Mn measurement (inductively coupled plasma-atomic absorption spectrometry (ICP-AAS): SMD = -1.14, 95% CI = [-2.24, -0.04]; graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS): SMD = -1.94, 95% CI = [-2.38, -1.49]; inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES): SMD = -3.77, 95% CI = [-4.70, -2.85]). No evidence of publication bias was observed. In conclusion, this meta-analysis supports a significant association between deficient Mn levels and breast cancer. However, the subgroup analysis found that there was contradiction regarding races and geography, like China and Turkey. Thus this finding needs further confirmation by trans-regional multicenter, long-term observation in a cohort design to obtain better understanding of causal relationships between Mn levels and breast cancer, through measuring Mn at baseline to investigate whether the highest Mn category versus lowest was associated with breast cancer risk.

25977030,"We present the application of a novel ambient LESA-MS method for the authentication of processed meat products. A set of 25 species and protein-specific heat stable peptide markers has been detected in processed samples manufactured from beef, pork, horse, chicken and turkey meat. We demonstrate that several peptides derived from myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins are sufficiently resistant to processing to serve as specific markers of processed products. The LESA-MS technique required minimal sample preparation without fractionation and enabled the unambiguous and simultaneous identification of skeletal muscle proteins and peptides as well as other components of animal origin, including the milk protein such as casein alpha-S1, in whole meat product digests. We have identified, for the first time, six fast type II and five slow/cardiac type I MHC peptide markers in various processed meat products. The study demonstrates that complex mixtures of processed proteins/peptides can be examined effectively using this approach.

The concentrations of the pesticides were followed during the process of transforming the spiked rose flowers from an organic field into concrete and then into absolute. The rose flowers, the concrete, and the absolute, as well as their transformation intermediates, were analyzed for pesticide content using gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. We observed that all the pesticides were extracted and concentrated in the absolute, with the exception of three molecules: fenthion, fenamiphos, and phorate. Typical pesticides were found to be concentrated by a factor of 100-300 from the rose flowers to the rose absolute. The observed effect of pesticide enrichment was also studied in roses and their extracts from four classically phytosanitary treated fields. Seventeen pesticides were detected in at least one of the extracts. Like the case for the spiked samples in our model, the pesticides present in the rose flowers from Turkey were concentrated in the absolute. Two pesticides, methidathion and chlorpyrifos, were quantified in the rose flowers at approximately 0.01 and 0.01-0.05 mg kg(-1), respectively, depending on the treated field.

25547312,"The present study was conducted to evaluate the lactic acid- and acetaldehyde-producing abilities of lactic acid bacterial species isolated from traditionally manufactured Turkish yogurts using HPLC. The lactic acid bacterial species purified from the yogurts were the 2 most widely used species in industrial yogurt production: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. These bacteria have the ability to ferment hexose sugars homofermentatively to generate lactic acid and some carbonyl compounds, such as acetaldehyde through pyruvate metabolism. The levels of the compounds produced during fermentation influence the texture and the flavor of the yogurt and are themselves influenced by the chemical composition of the milk, processing conditions, and the metabolic activity of the starter culture. In the study, morphological, biochemical, and molecular characteristics were employed to identify the bacteria obtained from homemade yogurts produced in different regions of Turkey. A collection of 91 Strep. thermophilus and 35 L. bulgaricus strains were investigated for their lactic acid- and acetaldehyde-formation capabilities in various media such as cow milk, LM17 agar, and aerobic-anaerobic SM17 agar or de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar. The amounts of the metabolites generated by each strain in all conditions were quantified by HPLC. The levels were found to vary depending on the species, the strain, and the growth conditions used. Whereas lactic acid production ranged between 0 and 77.9 mg/kg for Strep. thermophilus strains, it ranged from 0 to 103.5 mg/kg for L. bulgaricus. Correspondingly, the ability to generate acetaldehyde ranged from 0 to 105.9 mg/kg in Strep. thermophilus and from 0 to 126.9 mg/kg in L. bulgaricus. Our study constitutes the first attempt to determine characteristics of the wild strains isolated from traditional Turkish yogurts, and the approach presented here, which reveals the differences in metabolite production abilities of the wild lactic acid bacteria strains, holds the potential for the selection of the most desirable strains to be used as starters in commercial yogurt manufacture in the future.

In-solution tryptic digests of cooked meats were deposited onto a polymer surface, followed by LESA-MS analysis and evaluation using multivariate data analysis and tandem electrospray MS. The five types of cooked meat were clearly discriminated using principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis. 23 heat stable peptide markers unique to species and muscle protein were identified following data-dependent tandem LESA-MS analysis. Surface extraction and direct ambient MS analysis of mixtures of cooked meat species was performed for the first time and enabled detection of 10% (w/w) of pork, horse, and turkey meat and 5% (w/w) of chicken meat in beef, using the developed LESA-MS/MS analysis. The study shows, for the first time, that ambient LESA-MS methodology displays specificity sufficient to be implemented effectively for the analysis of processed and complex peptide digests.

The purpose of this work was to study the antioxidant properties and fatty acid composition of different parts of this plant (fruits and mixed materials). The species was collected from Golyuzu village of the Seydisehir district near Konya province, Turkey. Fruit and mixed parts obtained from this species were ground and a 15g sample was used to prepare methanolic extracts. Powdered plant samples were extracted with 100mL methanol in a mechanical shaker. The obtained extracts were filtered and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure and were subsequently stored at -20 degrees C. Antioxidant components, namely total phenolic and flavonoid content, were detected for each extract using spectrophotometric methods. Antioxidant capacity was evaluated by various assays including phosphomolybdenum, DPPH free radical scavenging capacity, metal chelating activity, and ferric and cupric ion reducing power. The fatty acid profiles of plant parts were also determined by using gas chromatography. The total phenolic content of fruit (36.21mgGAE/g) was higher than that of mixed materials (13.79mgGAE/g). The methanolic extract of mixed material had higher amounts of flavonoid than fruit extract. The free radical scavenging activity of extracts was expressed as IC50 value (microg/mL) (amount required to inhibit DPPH radical formation by 50%). The lower IC50 value reflects better free radical scavenging action. The radical scavenging activity of the samples was compared with BHT, it showed the mixed material to be almost two times more potent than the fruit extract. However, BHT is an excellent free radical scavenger with an IC50 of 34.061 microg/mL. The ferric and cupric reducing power potentials of the extracts were expressed as EC50 value (the effective concentration at which the absorbance was 0.5). Fruit extract exhibited strong ferric reducing power with an EC50 of 871.25 microg/mL. The metal chelating activity of the extracts increased with concentration. Chelating effect was 83.60% for fruit extract at 1mg/mL concentration. Oil content of fruit and mixed parts were detected as 6.71 and 6.14%, respectively. A total of 32 fatty acids were found in the oil. Essential fatty acids (linoleic and a-linolenic acid) were identified as the most abundant fatty acids in the oil. These results demonstrated that this plant species can be considered as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants.

The contents of trace elements were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry after application of microwave digestion. The samples from the thermal power plants, which were 10-22 km away from the hives, that did not cause pollution in honeydew honeys were also analyzed. The levels of copper, cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), zinc, manganese, iron, chromium, nickel, and aluminum were similar to the values found in other recent studies in literature.

The 28 samples for each wet, dry, and total deposition were collected weekly from March 2006 to March 2007. Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze the samples which were prepared by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) method. The sum of volume weighted mean of deposition fluxes was obtained as 7.43 μg m(-2) day(-1) for wet deposition, 0.28 μg m(-2) day(-1) for dry deposition and 0.54 μg m(-2) day(-1) for bulk deposition samples for PAHs and 9.88 μg m(-2) day(-1) for wet deposition, 4.49 μg m(-2) day(-1) for dry deposition, and 3.29 μg m(-2) day(-1) for bulk deposition samples for pesticides.

23949006,"Aflatoxin-producing fungi contaminate food and feed during pre-harvest, storage and processing periods. Once consumed, aflatoxins (AFs) accumulate in tissues, causing illnesses in animals and humans. Most human exposure to AF seems to be a result of consumption of contaminated plant and animal products. The policy of blending and dilution of grain containing higher levels of aflatoxins with uncontaminated grains for use in animal feed implicitly assumes that the deleterious effects of low levels of the toxins are linearly correlated to concentration. This assumption may not be justified, since it involves extrapolation of these nontoxic levels in feed, which are not of further concern. To develop a better understanding of the significance of low dose effects, in the present study, we developed quantitative methods for the detection of biologically active aflatoxin B₁ (AFB1) in Vero cells by two independent assays: the green fluorescent protein (GFP) assay, as a measure of protein synthesis by the cells, and the microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay, as a measure of cell viability. The results demonstrate a non-linear dose-response relationship at the cellular level. AFB1 at low concentrations has an opposite biological effect to higher doses that inhibit protein synthesis. Additional studies showed that heat does not affect the stability of AFB1 in milk and that the Vero cell model can be used to determine the presence of bioactive AFB1 in spiked beef, lamb and turkey meat. The implication of the results for the cumulative effects of low amounts of AFB1 in numerous foods is discussed.",Toxins,"['D016604', 'D000821', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D002470', 'D002522', 'D002851', 'D004305', 'D004797', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D005516', 'D057809', 'D006801', 'D007668', 'D008460', 'D008892', 'D012756', 'D014421', 'D014709']","['Aflatoxin B1', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Meat', 'Milk', 'Sheep', 'Turkey', 'Vero Cells']",Non-linear relationships between aflatoxin B₁ levels and the biological response of monkey kidney vero cells.,"['Q000302', None, None, None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000382', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['isolation & purification', None, None, None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'microbiology', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23949006,2014

The method includes all mycotoxins regulated in the European Union and mycotoxins regularly found in food. After extraction with an acidified acetonitrile water mixture, the raw extract was diluted and injected directly into the UHPLC-MS/MS system. In two chromatographic runs, analysis was performed in positive and in negative ionisation mode. The method was in-house validated for the most important 65 analytes in these four commodities. Apparent recoveries between 80 and 120% were obtained for about half of the analyte-matrix combinations. Good repeatabilities (standard deviations < 10%) were achieved for the vast majority (83%) of all cases. Only in 6% of all combinations did the standard deviations exceed 15%. Matrix effects, arising during electrospray ionisation, significantly influenced the determination. For instance, signal suppression was observed for several early-eluting analytes and also signal enhancement up to 295% for physcion in peanuts was determined. Concerning extraction recovery, 94% of the analyte-matrix combinations showed values higher than 50%. Lower limits of quantification ranged between 0.04 μg kg(-1) for enniatin B3 in peanuts and 500 μg kg(-1) for HC toxin in hazelnuts.

Concentrations of 11 metals (aluminum [Al], chromium [Cd], manganese [Mn], cobalt [Co], nickel [Ni], copper [Cu], molybdenum [Mo], silver [Ag], cadmium [Cd], mercury [Hg], and lead [Pb]) and a metalloid (arsenic [As]) were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and the relative frequencies of the most abundant isotopes of Cr, Cu, Ag, Cd, Hg, and Pb were evaluated. Three correlation trends were evaluated between the following: (1) different elements in the each individual tissue, (2) individual elements in different tissues, and (3) different elements in different tissues. In addition, correlation rates of growth parameters (weight, cephalothorax length, and total length) with heavy-metal and metalloid concentrations in each tissue were investigated. Our results suggest that substantial differences in metal and metalloid-accumulation levels exist between male and female specimens, with stronger correlations between the heavy-metal concentrations observed in the male cohort. It is notable that correlation trends of Co, Cu, (52)As, Cr, and Ni in exoskeleton of the male specimens display strong similarities. Likewise, a very strong correlation is present in Ni-Cd and Ni-Pb accumulations in abdominal muscle of the male specimens; a similar trend is present between Cd and Pb concentrations in the same tissue of female specimens. For correlation rates of different heavy metals and metalloid in different tissues, the strongest positive association observed was between (63)Cu in gill and As in hepatopancreas, whereas the strongest negative correlation was between accumulated Ni in abdominal muscle and As in exoskeleton. Strong correlations between metals and metalloid accumulations were observed between exoskeleton and gill. In many cases, metal and metalloid accumulation was negatively correlated with growth parameters. Preferential accumulation of Cr and Cu isotopes was observed in different tissues, suggesting that significant amounts of isotope fractionation occur during heavy-metal accumulation. Relatively low correlation rates were observed between (52)Cr/(53)Cr and (63)Cu/(65)Cu concentrations in several tissue types in both male and female cohorts, whereas no such trend was observed between Cd and Pb isotopes.",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D000818', 'D003400', 'D005260', 'D005618', 'D005880', 'D043143', 'D057230', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D019216', 'D018482', 'D011868', 'D014018']","['Animals', 'Astacoidea', 'Female', 'Fresh Water', 'Gills', 'Hepatopancreas', 'Limit of Detection', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Radioisotopes', 'Tissue Distribution']",Tissue distribution and correlation profiles of heavy-metal accumulation in the freshwater crayfish Astacus leptodactylus.,"[None, 'Q000502', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'physiology', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'metabolism', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23329359,2013

22545668,"Sun drying of seedless grapes (Vitis vinifera cv. Sultanina) is widely practised in the western Aegean Region providing Turkey with a significant share in the world trade of sultanas. Research was initiated in 1998 to determine the incidence of ochratoxin A (OTA), to identify the major factors resulting in contamination and to develop techniques to reduce or prevent contamination. This paper assesses OTA formation in five experimental vineyards located in Manisa province of Turkey between 1998 and 2003. The cultural practices recorded were tillage (type and timing), fertilisation, plant protection, irrigation, trellising, pruning, GA(3) application, harvest maturity and date, and drying practices (type of drying yard, dipping into alkaline solution, length of drying period). In the experimental vineyards, no OTA was found at veraison. OTA levels in grapes harvested at fresh maturity ranged between <LOD and 8 ng g(-1), whereas in dried sultanas they were between <LOD and 35 ng g(-1). The frequency of OTA-positive samples increased in dried grapes compared with fresh. The number and timing of tillage, number of damaged berries, and removal of damaged/infected berries prior to sun drying were identified as the major good practices that may contribute to the reduction of OTA in sultanas.","Food additives & contaminants.

This has led to the development of models relating tissue δ²H and δ¹⁸O values to those of water, with potential application in a number of fields. However, the strength and ubiquity of the influence of environmental water on protein isotope ratios across taxonomic groups, and thus the relevance of predictive models, is an open question. Here we report strong co-variation of δ²H and δ¹⁸O values across a suite of terrestrial and aquatic animal meats purchased in American food markets, including beef, poultry (chicken and turkey), chicken eggs, pork, lamb, freshwater fish, and marine fish. Significant isotope co-variation was not found for small collections of marine bivalves and crustaceans. These results imply that isotopic signals from environmental water were propagated similarly through most of the diverse natural and human-managed foodwebs represented by our samples. Freshwater fish had the largest variation in δ²H and δ¹⁸O values, with ranges of 121‰ and 19.2‰, respectively, reflecting the large isotopic variation in environmental freshwaters. In contrast marine animals had the smallest variation for both δ²H (7‰ range, crustaceans) and δ¹⁸O (3.0‰ range, bivalves) values.

Anthocyanins were the main flavonoids in red grapes ranging from 24 (Crimson) to 500 (Summer Royal) mg/kg fresh weight of grapes; consistent levels of flavonols and flavan-3-ols were also quantified in all varieties. To determine the effective climatic influence on flavonoids content in field conditions, viticultural practices have been developed, that could exclude the effects of direct solar radiation from confounding the assessment of those related to thermal conditions alone. A strong positive correlation was determined between flavonoids and temperature data that seem to be responsible for the difference of these metabolites along the years; furthermore, it has been possible to define a linear relationship (R(2) = 0.6871, P = 0.0057) between thermal amplitude and total flavonoids values in the red grapes.",Journal of food science,"['D000872', 'D044946', 'D002392', 'D002851', 'D005419', 'D005697', 'D005960', 'D007558', 'D044949', 'D016014', 'D009005', 'D044945', 'D011794', 'D027843']","['Anthocyanins', 'Biflavonoids', 'Catechin', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flavonoids', 'Galactosides', 'Glucosides', 'Italy', 'Kaempferols', 'Linear Models', 'Monosaccharides', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Quercetin', 'Vitis']",HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS analysis of flavonoid compounds in 5 seedless table grapes grown in Apulian Region.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000031', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analogs & derivatives', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22309436,2012

The method is based on a solid-liquid extraction separation on an ODS column, and the analytes are monitored at 295 nm with a UV detector. Tocopherols are extracted in n-hexane and directly injected onto the column without using any purification step, such as saponification, prior to the separation and determination. The chromatographic separation of tocopherols is achieved in 12 min with a mobile phase that consists of n-hexane and isopropyl alcohol (99.99:0.01, v/v). The method is reproducible and accurate, with respect to demonstrating a relative standard deviation between 2.57% and 3.30% (n = 10, for 500 ng/mL) and a relative error between 0.84% and 6.54% (n = 10, for 500 ng/mL), respectively.

There are limited data on levels of PCBs and OCPs in humans but no previous reports from Turkey on chemically determined levels PAHs in human milk. The aim of this study was to report the levels and accumulation profiles of OCPs, PCBs and PAHs in 47 breast milk samples obtained from a Mediterranean city, Mersin. High resolution analyses were performed by a gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (4.4'-DDE) was the dominant pollutant. Beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (ß-HCH), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (4.4'-DDT), dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene, oxy-chlordane, cis-heptachlorepoxide were the other main OCPs detected. Mean levels of ΣPCB congeners and WHO(PCB)-TEQ were 9.94 and 0.001 ng/g lipid, respectively. PCB 153 showed the highest concentration (3.37 ng/g lipid), followed by PCB 138 and 180. For the dioxin-like PCBs, PCB 118 was the dominant (0.97 ng/g lipid). Naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene and fluoranthene were the major PAHs among the 16 PAHs detected. The estimated daily intakes of DDTs, PCBs, HCHs and HCB were not exceeded the tolerable daily intake (TDI) proposed by the Health Canada Guideline.

21035830,"In oxidizing aquifers, arsenic (As) mobilization from sediments into groundwater is controlled by pH-dependent As desorption from and dissolution of mineral phases. If climate is dry, then the process of evaporative concentration contributes further to the total concentration of dissolved As. In this paper the principal As mobility controls under these conditions have been demonstrated for Salí River alluvial basin in NW Argentina (Tucumán Province; 7000 km(2)), which is representative for other basins or areas of the predominantly semi-arid Chaco-Pampean plain (1,000,000 km(2)) which is one of the world's largest regions affected by high As concentrations in groundwater. Detailed hydrogeochemical studies have been performed in the Salí River basin where 85 groundwater samples from shallow aquifers (42 samples), deep samples (26 samples) and artesian aquifers (17 samples) have been collected. Arsenic concentrations range from 11.4 to 1660 μg L(-1) leaving 100% of the investigated waters above the provisional WHO guideline value of 10 μg L(-1). A strong positive correlation among As, F, and V in shallow groundwaters was found. The correlations among those trace elements and U, B and Mo have less significance. High pH (up to 9.2) and high bicarbonate (HCO(3)) concentrations favour leaching from pyroclastic materials, including volcanic glass which is present to 20-25% in the loess-type aquifer sediments and yield higher trace element concentrations in groundwater from shallow aquifers compared to deep and artesian aquifers. The significant increase in minor and trace element concentrations and salinity in shallow aquifers is related to strong evaporation under semi-arid climatic conditions. Sorption of As and associated minor and trace elements (F, U, B, Mo and V) onto the surface of Fe-, Al- and Mn-oxides and oxi-hydroxides, restricts the mobilization of these elements into groundwater. Nevertheless, this does not hold in the case of the shallow unconfined groundwaters with high pH and high concentrations of potential competitors for adsorption sites (HCO(3), V, P, etc.). Under these geochemical conditions, desorption of the above mentioned anions and oxyanions occurs as a key process for As mobilization, resulting in an increase of minor and trace element concentrations. These geochemical processes that control the concentrations of dissolved As and other trace elements and which determine the groundwater quality especially in the shallow aquifers, are comparable to other areas with high As concentrations in groundwater of oxidizing aquifers and semi-arid or arid climate, which are found in many parts of the world, such as the western sectors of the USA, Mexico, northern Chile, Turkey, Mongolia, central and northern China, and central and northwestern Argentina.",Water research,"['D000327', 'D001118', 'D001151', 'D002118', 'D002852', 'D003889', 'D004553', 'D005618', 'D019015', 'D006863', 'D008274', 'D013058', 'D009391', 'D010100', 'D010783', 'D011188', 'D045483', 'D012964', 'D013054', 'D013696', 'D014874']","['Adsorption', 'Argentina', 'Arsenic', 'Calcium', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Desert Climate', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Fresh Water', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Magnesium', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Nephelometry and Turbidimetry', 'Oxygen', 'Photometry', 'Potassium', 'Rivers', 'Sodium', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Temperature', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Sources and controls for the mobility of arsenic in oxidizing groundwaters from loess-type sediments in arid/semi-arid dry climates - evidence from the Chaco-Pampean plain (Argentina).,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21035830,2011

The method was based on the microextraction of SAs in 300-mg muscle samples with 1 mL of a supramolecular solvent made up of reverse micelles of decanoic acid (DeA) and posterior determination of SAs in the extract by LC/fluorescence detection, after in situ derivatization with fluorescamine. Recoveries were quantitative (98-109%) and matrix-independent, no concentration of the extracts was required, the microextraction took about 30 min and several samples could be simultaneously treated. Formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic groups of the solvent and the target SAs (hydrogen donor and acceptor sum between 9 and 11) were considered as the major forces driving microextraction. The method was validated according to the European Union regulation 2002/657/EC. Analytical performance in terms of linearity, selectivity, trueness, precision, stability of SAs, decision limit and detection capability were determined. Quantitation limits for the different SAs ranged between 12 μg kg(-1) and 44 μg kg(-1), they being nearly independent of matrix composition.

Some chemical properties including pH, soluble solid content, titratable acidity, protein, moisture, ash, ascorbic acid, fructose, glucose, sucrose, total phenols, total antioxidant activity, and minerals were determined in fully matured Arbutus unedo L. and Arbutus andrachnae L. fruits collected from different sites of Canakkale, Turkey in 2006 and 2007. Total soluble solids, titratable acidity, protein, moisture, and ash content of A. unedo and A. andrachnae berries were on average 16.0% and 14.0%, 0.4% and 0.6%, 2.38% and 3.77%, 47.21% and 38.21%, and 2.82% and 4.35%, respectively. The mean values of ascorbic acid were 270.50 mg/100 g for A. unedo and 140.30 mg/100 g for A. andrachnae, which suggested that Arbutus berries contain high amounts of vitamin C. In the strawberry tree fruits, fructose and glucose were determined to be the major sugars. The analysis showed that fructose and glucose occurred in concentrations of 24.09% and 19.09%, respectively. However, ripe A. andrachnae fruits contained small amounts of fructose (4.12%), glucose (2.73%), and sucrose (0.16%) detectable by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The general order of abundance of the minerals was K > Ca > P > Mg > Na in whole fruit of the strawberry tree. The chemical composition of Arbutus fruits indicates that the fruits are good sources of minerals and ascorbic acid and that they are high in phenolics and antioxidant capacity and low in soluble sugars, especially A. andrachnae.

The samples were first dry-mixed for 5 min using a blender and sub-sampled seven times; the remainder was slurry homogenized (1 : 1, v/v) and sub-sampled seven times. Aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin levels were recorded and coefficient of variations (CV) computed for all sub-samples. Only a small reduction in sub-sample variations, indicated by the lower CV values, and slight differences in mean aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin levels were observed when slurry homogenization was applied. Therefore, 7326 dried figs, destined for export from Turkey to the EU and collected during the 2008 crop year, were dry-homogenized and tested for aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1 and G2) by immunoaffinity column clean-up using RP-HPLC. While 34% of the samples contained detectable levels of total aflatoxins (0.20-208.75 µg kg(-1)), only 9% of them exceeded the EU limit of 4 µg kg(-1) in the range 2.0-208.75 µg kg(-1), respectively.

Anticholinesterase effect of the extracts was tested against both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) at concentrations of 0.2 and 1 mg mL(-1) using microplate-reader assay based on Ellman method. Antioxidant activity of the LCC extracts was evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging method at 0.2 mg mL(-1) using microplate-reader assay. Both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of LCC exracts using Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney and Vero cell lines. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were screened against the bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis as well as the fungi: Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis. Only the petroleum ether extract of LCC possessed remarkable activity against both AChE and BChE at 1 mg mL(-1) (76.5 and 69.6%, respectively), whereas LCC extracts showed low free radical-scavenging activity. All of the extracts were found to be more effective against the ATCC strains than isolated ones, particularly S. aureus, while the extracts had moderate antifungal activity. On the other hand, we found that only the petroleum ether extract was active against HSV.

19249817,"The pomegranate fruit ( Punica granatum ) has become an international high-value crop for the production of commercial pomegranate juice (PJ). The perceived consumer value of PJ is due in large part to its potential health benefits based on a significant body of medical research conducted with authentic PJ. To establish criteria for authenticating PJ, a new International Multidimensional Authenticity Specifications (IMAS) algorithm was developed through consideration of existing databases and comprehensive chemical characterization of 45 commercial juice samples from 23 different manufacturers in the United States. In addition to analysis of commercial juice samples obtained in the United States, data from other analyses of pomegranate juice and fruits including samples from Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Syria, India, and China were considered in developing this protocol. There is universal agreement that the presence of a highly constant group of six anthocyanins together with punicalagins characterizes polyphenols in PJ. At a total sugar concentration of 16 degrees Brix, PJ contains characteristic sugars including mannitol at >0.3 g/100 mL. Ratios of glucose to mannitol of 4-15 and of glucose to fructose of 0.8-1.0 are also characteristic of PJ. In addition, no sucrose should be present because of isomerase activity during commercial processing. Stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry as > -25 per thousand assures that there is no added corn or cane sugar added to PJ. Sorbitol was present at <0.025 g/100 mL; maltose and tartaric acid were not detected. The presence of the amino acid proline at >25 mg/L is indicative of added grape products. Malic acid at >0.1 g/100 mL indicates adulteration with apple, pear, grape, cherry, plum, or aronia juice. Other adulteration methods include the addition of highly concentrated aronia, blueberry, or blackberry juices or natural grape pigments to poor-quality juices to imitate the color of pomegranate juice, which results in abnormal anthocyanin profiles. To adjust the astringent taste of poor-quality juice or peel extract, addition of nonpomegranate sugars is a commonly detected adulteration method. The profile generated from these analyses combined with information from existing databases and published literature has been integrated into a validated IMAS for PJ, which can be utilized to detect PJ adulteration. In this survey of commercial pomegranate juices, only 6 of 23 strictly met all of the IMAS criteria.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000465', 'D000596', 'D000872', 'D001628', 'D002241', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D047348', 'D038622', 'D029561', 'D012016']","['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Anthocyanins', 'Beverages', 'Carbohydrates', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Hydrolyzable Tannins', 'Internationality', 'Lythraceae', 'Reference Values']",International multidimensional authenticity specification (IMAS) algorithm for detection of commercial pomegranate juice adulteration.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19249817,2009

The MALDI-TOF-MS profiles of crude heterophil extract showed a high intensity peak with average mass of m/z 3916.1 for chicken and m/z 4129.6 for turkey. To identify these peaks, we first purified m/z 3916.1 from chicken bone marrow extract using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Edman sequencing and peptide mass fingerprinting exclusively confirmed this peptide as beta-defensin 2 (BD2) or gallinacin-2, a broad-range antimicrobial peptide. A Uniprot database search followed by the MASCOT sequence query revealed m/z 4129.6 to be the corresponding turkey ortholog of avian beta-defensin 2 (AvBD2), also called turkey heterophil peptide 2. Both AvBD2 peptides are 36 amino acids long including a highly conserved region with 6 invariant cysteines forming the 3 disulfide bonds characteristic of defensins. The method confirmed the existence of the complete mature peptide sequence of the turkey heterophilic BD2 previously proposed based on cDNA analysis.

Fourteen selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in particulate matter were determined simultaneously by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FL) and seasonal distributions were examined. The source identification of PAHs in airborne particulates was performed by principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with diagnostic ratios. The predominant PAHs determined in PM(2.5) were pyrene, fluoranthene, benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene. The total concentrations of PAHs were up to 464.0 ng m(-3) in fine and 28.0 ng m(-3) in coarse fraction in winter, whereas in summer times were up to 22.9 and 3.0 ng m(-3) respectively. Approximately 93.3% of total PAHs concentration was determined in PM(2.5) in winter and 84.0% in summer. The concentration levels of PAHs fluctuate significantly within a year with higher means and peak concentrations in the winter compared to that of summer times. Higher benzo(a)pyrene-equivalent (BaPE) concentrations of PAHs were obtained for PM(2.5) especially in winter. The results obtained from PCA in combination with diagnostic ratios revealed that coal combustion and vehicle emissions were the major pollutant sources for both PM(2.5) and PM(2.5-10) associated PAHs in studied area. Two principal components for PM(2.5) and three for PM(2.5-10) were identified and these accounted for 89.4 and 85.2% of the total variance respectively.

17345011,"Waste water pollution in industrial areas is one of the most important environmental problems. Heavy metal pollution, especially chromium species in waste water sources from tannery affects our lives. Kocabas Stream is located in south-west Marmara region and Biga town is positioned in the sub basin on the stream. This water source functions as the water for irrigation in agriculture, drinking water for animals and for human use. Thus, this study is of great importance. Waste water pollution can affect all ecosystems and human health by directly or indirectly as in food chain. The concentration of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn and Cr) were pre-analysed by ICP-AES method in water samples taken from sub-basin of Kocabas stream. In the results of these analyses, concentrations of the metals except chromium were founded at the limit value. But the total concentration of the Cr was found at high levels of between 0.0082 +/- 0.0001 and 5.7231 +/- 0.0921 mg l(-1) over the limit value (0.05 mg l(-1); WHO, EPA, TSE 266 and inland water quality classification) at sampling points very close to tannery factories.

17300147,"The antibacterial drug furazolidone belonging to the group of nitrofuran antibacterial agents has been widely used as an antibacterial and antiprotozoal feed additive for poultry, cattle, and farmed fish in China. During application a large proportion of the administered drug may reach the environment directly or via feces. Although the use of furazolidone is prohibited in numerous countries, there are indications of its illegal use. It is known that furazolidone can be rapidly metabolized to 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ) in the body of the target organism. In this study, a total of 21 fish feed samples, including 17 commercial fish feeds from local markets in China (representing 15 different formulations) and 4 fish feeds obtained from Germany and Turkey, respectively, are analyzed to determine whether the drug is still illegally used or commercially available feeds are contaminated by this drug. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) methods have been implemented to determine furazolidone and its metabolite AOZ in fish feeds containing animal protein, respectively. An efficient and convenient cleanup method for the determination of furazolidone in fish feeds is developed, and a simple cleanup method for the determination of AOZ is used. Method recoveries for samples used were determined as 87.7-98.3% for furazolidone at two spike levels of 2.0 and 5.0 ng g-1 and as 95.6-102.8% for AOZ at spike levels of 0.4 and 0.8 ng g-1. Limits of detections were 0.4 ng g-1 for furazolidone and 0.05 ng g-1 for AOZ. The established methods are therefore suitable for the determination of furazolidone and its metabolite AOZ in fish feeds at trace contamination levels. Using the established methods, all fish feed samples have been proved to be furazolidone negative; however, AOZ is tested in 16 of 17 fish feeds obtained from local markets in the Hubei province of China, with a positive rate as high as 94.1%.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000821', 'D000818', 'D000890', 'D002273', 'D002851', 'D002853', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D005664', 'D009153', 'D023303', 'D021241']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Carcinogens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Furazolidone', 'Mutagens', 'Oxazolidinones', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']","Determinations of residual furazolidone and its metabolite, 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ), in fish feeds by HPLC-UV and LC-MS/MS, respectively.","['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17300147,2007

The research was conducted between May and June 2002. The study included 236 children (53.4% female and 46.6% male) who were identified among the healthy children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years, using a systematic sampling method, from the records of the local medical centre of Yatağan. Assessments of the levels of blood lead and cadmium were performed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, in the Department of Biophysics, Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty. The mean age of females and males were 49+/-18 and 43+/-19 months, respectively. The mean blood lead level was 33.8+/-15.6 microg/dL in females and 38.8+/-16.0 microg/dL in males. The mean blood lead level of the males was significantly higher than the females (P<0.05). Correlation analysis showed a statistically significant negative correlation between blood lead level and age in both sex groups (r= -0.367, P<0.001). The blood lead level was found to be > 10 microg/dL in 95.7% and >20 microg/dL in 87.6% of all children. The mean blood cadmium level of all children was 1.31+/-0.72 microg/dL. The blood cadmium level was found to be >0.5 microg/dL, which is considered to be toxic, in 85% of all children. The difference in blood cadmium levels between sexes was not significant. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between blood cadmium level and age of all children (r= -0.382, P<0.001). Although it is not possible to understand from this study what proportion of the biological lead and cadmium burden results from mining waste and what proportion comes from other sources, such as paint and gasoline residue deposited in soil and air, these results do indicate that asymptomatic lead poisoning and cadmium exposure are significant problems in children living in the Yatağan area. In conclusion, environmental lead measurements (house dust, soil, drinking water and air) must be performed, the results must be compared with the normal limits, and precautions must be taken if necessary in the Yatağan area.

The press cake extracts were compared with extracts from cranberry juice powder (CJP), prepared using chloroform:methanol (1:1), for their ability to inhibit lipid oxidation in mechanically separated turkey (MST). Because of the susceptibility of muscle membrane lipids to oxidation, the ability of quercetin in the extracts to partition between the aqueous and the membrane phases was studied. Membrane suspensions were prepared from MST. Partitioning of quercetin was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Oxidation was studied by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and lipid peroxides. The effectiveness of the extracts to inhibit lipid oxidation was CJP extract > ethyl acetate extract of press cake > or = ethanol extract of press cake. The amount of quercetin in the extracts and the amount of quercetin that partitioned into the membranes followed the same order. However, the total phenolic content of the extracts did not follow the same order as that of inhibitory power. The phenolic content of the extracts decreased, ethyl acetate extract > ethanol extract of press cake > or = chloroform extract of CJP. Irrespective of the extraction method, around 78% quercetin from the extracts partitioned into the membranes. It could be concluded that increasing the amount of quercetin in the press cake extracts increases the ability of the extracts to inhibit lipid oxidation in MST. Hence, a proper choice of solvents and extraction method, which would increase the amount of quercetin in the press cake extracts, might increase the antioxidant potential of the extracts and hence their economic value.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D005511', 'D005638', 'D015227', 'D008460', 'D018482', 'D010936', 'D011794', 'D017392', 'D014422', 'D029799']","['Animals', 'Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Meat', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Plant Extracts', 'Quercetin', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances', 'Turkeys', 'Vaccinium macrocarpon']",Partitioning and inhibition of lipid oxidation in mechanically separated turkey by components of cranberry press cake.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16910737,2006

Adulteration with hazelnut oil is one of the most difficult to detect due to the similar composition of hazelnut and olive oils; both virgin olive oil and olive oil are subjected to that kind of adulteration. The main objective of this work was to develop an analytical method able to detect adulteration of virgin olive oils and olive oils with hazelnut oil by means of its analysis by a headspace autosampler directly coupled to a mass spectrometer used as detector (ChemSensor). As no chromatographic separation of the individual components of the samples exists, a global signal of the sample is obtained and employed for its characterization by means of chemometric techniques. Four different crude hazelnut oils from Turkey were employed for the development of the method. Multivariate regression techniques (partial least squares and principal components analysis) were applied to generate adequate regression models. Good values were obtained in both techniques for the parameters employed (standard errors of prediction (SEP) and prediction residual error sum of squares (PRESS)) to evaluate its goodness. With the proposed method, minimum adulteration levels of 7 and 15% can be detected in refined and virgin olive oils, respectively.

Test portions were spiked at levels of 4.0 and 10.0 ng/g for total aflatoxins by participants using supplied total aflatoxins standards. Recoveries for total aflatoxins and aflatoxin B1 averaged from 86 to 89%. Based on results for naturally contaminated samples (blind duplicates at 3 levels ranging from 4.0 to 11.8 ng/g total aflatoxins), the relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 2.3 to 3.4% for total aflatoxins and from 2.2 to 3.2% for aflatoxin B1. The relative standard deviation for reproducibility (RSD(R)) ranged from 6.1 to 7.0% for total aflatoxins and from 7.3 to 7.8% for aflatoxin B1.

15852149,"A method is described for the identification and quantitative determination of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid hydrazide (DSH), the marker residue of nifursol metabolites in poultry (turkey, broiler) muscle and liver tissue. The method is based on the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of tissue-bound metabolites to free DSH and in situ derivatisation with 2-nitrobenzaldehyde to the corresponding nitrophenyl derivative NPDSH. A structural analogue of DSH, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid hydrazide (HBH) was synthesised to serve as an internal standard. The analytes were isolated from the matrix by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Determination was performed by LC-MS/MS with negative electrospray ionisation. The [M - H](+) ions of NPDSH and NPHBH at m/z 374 were fragmented by collision induced dissociation (CID) producing transition ions at m/z 182, 183 and 226. The transition ions at m/z 182 and 226 were selected for monitoring of NPDSH while the transition ion at m/z 183 was selected for NPHBH. The method has been validated according to the EU criteria of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 microg kg(-1) in muscle and liver tissue. A decision limit (CC(alpha)) was obtained of 0.04 and 0.025 microg kg(-1) in muscle and liver, respectively. Similarly a detection capability (CC(beta)) was obtained of 0.10 and 0.05 microg kg(-1) in muscle and liver, respectively. The introduction of HBH as an internal standard did not lead to a significant improvement of the quantitative performance of the method. In fact for liver better performance characteristics were obtained when the IS was not taken into account. Nevertheless, as a qualitative marker for recovery, HBH could still be very useful in the analysis of unknown samples.",The Analyst,"['D000818', 'D000981', 'D002853', 'D004350', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D008099', 'D013058', 'D009132', 'D009581', 'D011200']","['Animals', 'Antiprotozoal Agents', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Drug Residues', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Liver', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Muscles', 'Nitrofurans', 'Poultry']",Determination of nifursol metabolites in poultry muscle and liver tissue.

The objective of the present work was to establish information on nifursol residues in turkey and chicken meat. The analytical method was based on conversion of nifursol and its metabolites with an intact 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid hydrazide (DNSH) side chain to the 2-nitrophenyl analogue of nifursol (NPDNSH) by treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid and 2-nitrobenzaldehyde. Nifuroxazide (salicylic acid (5-nitrofurfurylidene) hydrazide) added as an internal standard was converted to the 2-nitrophenyl analogue NPSH. After the addition of ammonia, proteins were precipitated with acetonitrile. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C18 column and negative-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was employed using m/z 183 and 226 (daughter ions of the NPDNSH phenolate ion m/z 374) for quantification and m/z 93 (daughter ion of the NPSH phenolate ion m/z 284) as a retention time reference.

The main products are poppy straw and concentrate of poppy straw, obtained from dried poppy capsules. The aims of the study reported in the present article were to establish inorganic element profiles for the poppy-growing provinces of Turkey by means of x-ray analysis by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS) and to explore the potential of the technique for determination of origin. Ten elements (sodium, magnesium, silicon, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, potassium, calcium, copper and zinc) were analysed in poppy straw samples from 67 towns in nine provinces. As regards the determination of origin, the most significant finding was the presence of copper and zinc in the poppy straw samples from 8 of the 15 towns in Afyon Province. Since those elements are not normally found in soil, it is assumed that their presence is the result of environmental (industrial) contamination. Differences in the samples from the other eight provinces were less significant, possibly a result of their geographical proximity. Nevertheless, differences in the samples were apparent. Because the findings are relative rather than absolute in terms of presence or absence of individual inorganic elements, further research is required to convert them into operationally usable results. The inorganic element profiles generated in the study have been used to form the basis for the development of a comprehensive database on poppy straw samples, which may be used in comparing samples and determining their origin.",Bulletin on narcotics,"['D000383', 'D003132', 'D004340', 'D006801', 'D007287', 'D008855', 'D053610', 'D010207', 'D028321', 'D012989', 'D013052', 'D014421']","['Agriculture', 'Commerce', 'Drug Contamination', 'Humans', 'Inorganic Chemicals', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Opiate Alkaloids', 'Papaver', 'Plant Preparations', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission', 'Turkey']",Determination of inorganic elements in poppy straw by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry as a means of ascertaining origin.,"['Q000379', 'Q000331', 'Q000331', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000254', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None]","['methods', 'legislation & jurisprudence', 'legislation & jurisprudence', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'growth & development', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21338021,2011

15473693,"Expanded understanding of the factors that direct polypeptide ion fragmentation can lead to improved specificity in the use of tandem mass spectrometry for the identification and characterization of proteins. Like the fragmentation of peptide cations, the dissociation of whole protein cations shows several preferred cleavages, the likelihood for which is parent ion charge dependent. While such cleavages are often observed, they are far from universally observed, despite the presence of the residues known to promote them. Furthermore, cleavages at residues not noted to be common in a variety of proteins can be dominant for a particular protein or protein ion charge state. Motivated by the ability to study a small protein, turkey ovomucoid third domain, for which a variety of single amino acid variants are available, the effects of changing the identity of one amino acid in the protein sequence on its dissociation behavior were examined. In particular, changes in amino acids associated with C-terminal aspartic acid cleavage and N-terminal proline cleavage were emphasized. Consistent with previous studies, the product ion spectra were found to be dependent upon the parent ion charge state. Furthermore, the fraction of possible C-terminal aspartic acid cleavages observed to occur for this protein was significantly larger than the fraction of possible N-terminal proline cleavages. In fact, very little N-terminal proline cleavage was noted for the wild-type protein despite the presence of three proline residues in the protein. The addition/removal of proline and aspartic acids was studied along with changes in selected residues adjacent to proline residues. Evidence for inhibition of proline cleavage by the presence of nearby basic residues was noted, particularly if the basic residue was likely to be protonated.",Journal of proteome research,"['D000595', 'D019943', 'D000818', 'D001120', 'D001224', 'D006639', 'D008239', 'D013058', 'D008969', 'D010059', 'D010084', 'D010446', 'D011392', 'D011994', 'D014422']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Histidine', 'Lysine', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Ovomucin', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Proline', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Turkeys']",Effects of single amino acid substitution on the collision-induced dissociation of intact protein ions: Turkey ovomucoid third domain.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15473693,2005

The impact of eating the raisins on the dietary intake of lead was estimated for Canadians of different ages and sexes. For example, eating raisins from Turkey would increase the dietary intake of lead by 1-4-year-old children from 0.97 to approximately 2.2 microg kg(-1) body weight day(-1). The source of the lead was traced to use of a copper fungicide contaminated with high lead levels.

11436815,"The Golden Horn is a heavily polluted water body in a large metropolitan area with a population of approximately 10 million. A 3-m long undisturbed core sample was collected in the Golden Horn, from research vessel RV Knorr, during the third leg of the joint Turkish--American Black Sea expedition in 1989. The core was sliced and dated using the 210Pb isotope technique. The bottom of the core corresponds to the year 1912. Each slice was analysed for major, minor and trace elements by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP). The masses of the measured elements can account for approximately half of the sediment mass. The lithophilic elements Li, K, Rb, Mg, Ca, Ba, Al, La, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni account for more than 90% of the elemental mass and do not show any change in their concentrations between 1912 and 1987. Although anthropogenic elements Mo, Zn, Cr, Cu, Ag, and Cd account for a minute fraction of the elemental mass, their concentrations increase along the core, signifying human influence on chemical composition of the Golden Horn Sediments. Lead was enriched at the bottom of the core suggesting pollution of Golden Horn sediments by this element even at the beginning of the century, but observed concentrations of the remaining anthropogenic elements, at the bottom of the core, can be explained by sedimentary material. Concentrations of pollution-derived elements do not change significantly between 1912 and 1950, but their concentrations increase sharply in the second half of the century. A factor analysis applied to the data set has shown that the inorganic fraction of the Golden Horn sediments includes crustal, marine and two anthropogenic components. One of the anthropogenic components is attributed to the discharges from an iron and steel plant. The second anthropogenic component, which accounted for a larger fraction of system variance, is due to discharges from industries, particularly metalwork plants.",Marine pollution bulletin,"['D000883', 'D003247', 'D019015', 'D006801', 'D019216', 'D012989', 'D014421']","['Anthropology', 'Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Humans', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Turkey']",Evolution of metal pollution in the golden horn (Turkey) sediments between 1912 and 1987.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11436815,2001

The sensitivity of each plate is optimal for only one of these groups, resulting in detection limits (LOD) lower than the corresponding maximum residue limits (MRL) and in distinct inhibition patterns typical for each antibiotic family. Beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin G, ampicillin and amoxicillin give only inhibition zones on the plate with M. luteus. Tetracyclines are detected up to the MRL level with B. cereus, and fluoroquinolones with E. coli. The LODs of the antibiotics tested were as follows: penicillin G (PENG) 0.9 ng, ampicillin (AMPI) 0.6 ng and amoxicillin (AMOX) 1.0 ng on the plate with M. luteus; tetracycline (TET) 4 ng, oxytetracycline (OXY) 3 ng, doxycycline (DOX) 0.6 ng, and chlortetracycline (CHL) 0.3 ng on the plate with B. cereus; enrofloxacin (ENRX) 1.5 ng, ciprofloxacin (CIPX) 0.5 ng and flumequine (FLUM) 1.5 ng on the plate with E. coli.

Turkeys, raised with diets containing 25, 50, 75, or 100 IU of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (TA)/kg diet from 1 to 105 d of age, were fed with diets containing 25, 200, 400, or 600 IU of TA/kg diet from 105 to 122 d of age. Breast and leg meat patties were prepared, irradiated at 0 or 2.5 kGy dose, cooked to an internal temperature of 78 C, and stored in either vacuum or aerobic packaging. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) values gradually decreased as the dietary TA increased and > 200 IU TA/kg diet treatments were helpful in maintaining low TBARS values in irradiated breast and leg meat patties during the 7-d storage period. With vacuum-packaging, irradiated cooked breast patties developed more oxidation than nonirradiated patties but the prooxidant effect of irradiation in cooked leg meat patties was not consistent. In aerobic-packaged cooked meat, irradiated patties had lower TBARS than nonirradiated patties in both breast and leg meat stored in oxygen permeable bags for 7 d. Propanal, pentanal, hexanal, 1-pentanol, and total volatiles were highly correlated with the TBARS values of meat. However, hexanal represented the lipid oxidation status of cooked meat better than any other volatiles component. The amount of hexanal and total volatiles in cooked breast and leg meat shows decreasing trends as dietary TA increased. In vacuum packaging, irradiated breast and leg meat had higher hexanal and total volatiles content than nonirradiated meat at both 0 and 7 d of storage. In aerobic packaging, the amount of hexanal and total volatiles greatly increased in both irradiated and nonirradiated meat patties during the 7-d storage periods. The results illustrated that the antioxidant effect of TA was not strong enough to control lipid oxidation and off-odor generation in cooked meat stored under aerobic conditions because the progress of lipid oxidation in cooked meat under aerobic condition is very rapid.

9457242,"Adenosine 3',5'- and 2',5'-bisphosphates previously were demonstrated to act as competitive antagonists at the P2Y1 receptor (Boyer et al. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996, 50, 1323-1329). 2'- and 3'-Deoxyadenosine bisphosphate analogues containing various structural modifications at the 2- and 6-positions of the adenine ring, on the ribose moiety, and on the phosphate groups have been synthesized with the goal of developing more potent and selective P2Y1 antagonists. Single-step phosphorylation reactions of adenosine nucleoside precursors were carried out. The activity of each analogue at P2Y1 receptors was determined by measuring its capacity to stimulate phospholipase C in turkey erythrocyte membranes (agonist effect) and to inhibit phospholipase C stimulation elicited by 10 nM 2-MeSATP (antagonist effect). Both 2'- and 3'-deoxy modifications were well tolerated. The N6-methyl modification both enhanced antagonistic potency (IC50 330 nM) of 2'-deoxyadenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate by 17-fold and eliminated residual agonist properties observed with the lead compounds. The N6-ethyl modification provided intermediate potency as an antagonist, while the N6-propyl group completely abolished both agonist and antagonist properties. 2-Methylthio and 2-chloro analogues were partial agonists of intermediate potency. A 2'-methoxy group provided intermediate potency as an antagonist while enhancing agonist activity. An N1-methyl analogue was a weak antagonist with no agonist activity. An 8-bromo substitution and replacement of the N6-amino group with methylthio, chloro, or hydroxy groups greatly reduced the ability to interact with P2Y1 receptors. Benzoylation or dimethylation of the N6-amino group also abolished or greatly diminished the antagonist activity. In summary, our results further define the structure-activity of adenosine bisphosphates as P2Y1 receptor antagonists and have led to the identification of the most potent antagonist reported to date for this receptor.",Journal of medicinal chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002851', 'D003838', 'D004910', 'D008956', 'D058919', 'D058472', 'D013329', 'D014422', 'D010738']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides', 'Erythrocyte Membrane', 'Models, Chemical', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y1', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Turkeys', 'Type C Phospholipases']",Deoxyadenosine bisphosphate derivatives as potent antagonists at P2Y1 receptors.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9457242,1998

Nicholas turkey toms were reared on diets containing vitamin E levels as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate equivalent to the NRC recommendations (12 and 10 IU/kg from 0 to 8 and 9 to 18 wk, respectively) and 5x, 10x, and 25x the NRC diet. Two other diets were evaluated and included feeding the NRC diet until 15 and 16 wk followed by a diet containing 20x the NRC vitamin E level. All turkeys were processed in a commercial turkey processing plant and breast meat scored for color. Breast meat was excised from four carcasses per treatment and evaluated after refrigeration (1 and 7 d) or frozen storage (30, 90, 150 d) for oxidative stability and sensory quality by TBA analysis, descriptive flavor profiling, and headspace gas chromatography. The TBA values were inversely related to the dietary vitamin E levels. Refrigerated samples had TBA values 78 to 88% lower for the 10x and 25x vitamin E treatments, respectively, than for the NRC control treatment. No differences in TBA values (refrigerated samples) were detected for the 10x, 25x, and 20x (3 wk feeding duration) or across all treatments for samples frozen for 5 mo. The 10x and 25x NRC diets produced the most typical and acceptable turkey meat flavors with the fewest oxidized off-flavor notes for both fresh and frozen samples as opposed to the more oxidized flavor notes detected in the control samples.

HAAs are a group of recently recognized mutagenic/carcinogenic contaminants in foods that are produced during the heat processing of meat. 16 samples of meat cuts (e.g. turkey breast, salami, chicken loaf, cooked ham, all beef meat, pepperoni, etc.), randomly purchased from supermarkets and specialty food stores in the Ottawa area, were analysed for the presence of eight HAAs. The isolation of HAAs was based on sequential liquid-liquid extraction procedures of the samples at both acidic and basic pH values. The mutagenic activity of these samples was determined using the Ames/Salmonella microsome assay with the strain TA98 plus rat liver S-9 metabolic activation. The mutagenicity of these samples ranged from undetectable to slightly active. The highest mutagenic activity, 141 induced revertants/g, was found in a smoked turkey breast sample. 11 samples were not mutagenic, including two that indicated a tendency for inhibition of the spontaneous revertants. The remaining four samples exhibited very low mutagenic activity. For chemical analysis, the extracts were purified with two solid phase extraction cartridges. Quantitative analysis was performed by using liquid chromatography for separation and mass spectrometry for detection. With the exception of trace amounts (0.4 ng/g) of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) in the sample with highest mutagenic activity, the chemical analysis did not detect the presence of any of the eight most frequently found HAAs in fried or broiled meat products.

The well-recognized manifestations of systemic Al toxicity include fracturing osteomalacia, dialysis encephalopathy, and microcytic hypochromic anemia. The role of Al in causing childhood diseases is also becoming clearer, but the safe plasma level still remains to be determined in newborns, especially in premature newborns, implying that it should be kept low. Premature infants receiving iv fluid therapy show evidence of Al loading. Additionally, the infant-feeding mixtures, especially the soy-based infant formulas, tested may be a significant additional source of Al in the diet of infants with low birthweights, and in infants and in young children with impaired renal function. Careful clinical and biochemical monitoring is warranted to determine whether it will be necessary to eliminate Al contamination of both oral and parenteral preparations used in infants and children who may be at risk for Al intoxication. In this present study, the Al content of infant feeds was measured by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and also compared with those of breast milk, cow's milk, milk powder, and some starches that are commonly used for preparation of infant feed in Turkey. Our results show that Al content of commercially available powdered infant formulas, most of which are imported from Europe, ranged from 1.211 to 10.925 micrograms/g.

Examination showed that 11% of 112 consignments of fig paste and 9% of 93 consignments of whole dried figs were contaminated with total alfatoxin concentrations above 10 micrograms/kg, with the highest level of contamination being 40 micrograms/kg.

2613784,"Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was used to separate metallothionein (MT) isoforms and on-line atomic absorption spectrophotometric (AAS) detection was used to quantitatively determine their metal content. With this coupled system (HPLC-AAS), it was possible to determine the zinc, cadmium and copper content of individual horse kidney MT isoforms. When rabbit liver MT and the purified isoforms (MT-1 and MT-2) were subjected to RP-HPLC and the zinc-containing peaks of the MT sample to MT-1 or MT-2. HPLC-AAS was used to identify zinc-induced MT in heat-treated cytosol from turkey hen liver, thereby demonstrating its application to the analysis of crude tissue extracts. A standard curve was established using turkey liver MT for the quantitative determination of the zinc content of MT isoforms. There was excellent linear correlation between the micrograms of zinc bound to MT injected onto the column (ranging from 0.34 to 3.43 micrograms of MT-bond zinc) and the integrated peak area of the atomic absorbance for zinc. Using this standard curve, it was possible to quantitate the amount of MT-bound zinc in cytosol extracts of cultured turkey embryo hepatocytes exposed to varying levels of supplemental zinc in the culture medium.",Journal of chromatography,"['D000818', 'D002478', 'D002851', 'D006736', 'D007527', 'D007668', 'D008099', 'D008668', 'D008670', 'D011817', 'D013054', 'D014422', 'D015032']","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Horses', 'Isoenzymes', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Metallothionein', 'Metals', 'Rabbits', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Turkeys', 'Zinc']",Characterization of the metal composition of metallothionein isoforms using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with atomic absorption spectrophotometric detection.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000201', 'Q000166', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'enzymology', 'cytology', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2613784,1990
6709566,"When eviscerated turkey carcasses are illuminated with white light from a 100 W lamp in the body cavity dorsal to the sternum, about 90% of carcasses with deep pectoral myopathy can be detected subjectively. With this method, subjective detection is more reliable than photometric detection. When a fiber-optic probe is placed in direct contact with a lesion, the absorbance spectrum of reflected light is radically different to the spectrum from normal muscle, and three types of lesions can be identified (red-purple, green, and yellow). However, the presence of lesions is masked by even a shallow depth (approximately 1 cm) of normal muscle between the lesion and the probe. A combination of both optical methods might enable carcasses to be inspected without slashing the breast muscles of all the carcasses from flocks of suspect birds, but the whole length of the supracoracoideus on each side would have to be traversed by the fiber-optic probe. For a fiber-optic detection system in the abattoir, the simplest diagnostic characteristic would be the ratio of two wavelengths (480/550 nm). The average ratio for normal muscle was .68. The average ratios for lesions were from 1.17 to 1.38.",Poultry science,"['D000003', 'D000818', 'D003116', 'D005336', 'D005513', 'D009135', 'D055100', 'D010369', 'D011201', 'D013053', 'D014422']","['Abattoirs', 'Animals', 'Color', 'Fiber Optic Technology', 'Food Inspection', 'Muscular Diseases', 'Optical Fibers', 'Pectoralis Muscles', 'Poultry Diseases', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Turkeys']",Optical characteristics of deep pectoral myopathy in turkey carcasses.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000175', None, None, 'Q000175', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'diagnosis', None, None, 'diagnosis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6709566,1984

The composition of the remaining polar lipids was examined by thin layer chromatography and color reactions. 2. The tissues studied included: hair from a monkey (Macacca fascicularis), dog (Canis familiaris), raccoon (Procyon lotor) and cow (Bos taurus); full-thickness epidermis from a pig (Sus scrofa) and pilot whale (Globicephala melaena); epidermal scales and feathers from a fowl (Gallus gallus); scales, feathers, beaks and claws from a turkey (Meleagris gallopavo); hoof and horn from cattle (Bos taurus); and cast skins from a Columbian boa (Boa constrictor) and a Ball python (Python regius). 3. All of the tissues contained both simple ceramides and highly polar glycolipids (presumably gangliosides). 4. Glycolipids of intermediate polarity were present in all of the tissues from birds and snakes and in the mammalian tissues which contained unkeratinized epidermal cells, but were absent from fully keratinized mammalian tissues such as hair, hoof and horn. 5. The presence of the highly polar gangliosides provides for the formation of the multiple intercellular lipid lamellae which have been observed in the epidermal horny layer of mammals, birds and reptiles and which are believed to constitute the epidermal barrier to water diffusion.","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

4462558,"1. Turkey liver xanthine dehydrogenase engaged in catalysing the oxidation of xanthine by dichlorophenol-indophenol was progressively inactivated by methanol. This inactivation was reversible by NAD(+). 2. Reaction with arsenite and with cyanide, in each case first-order with respect to enzyme, resulted in characteristic alterations in the visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme. The rate of spectral change on reaction with either agent paralleled the rate of loss of enzyme activity. 3. Cyanide inactivation was accompanied by elimination from the enzyme of sulphur as thiocyanate. Partial restoration of activity was effected by incubation with sulphide or with selenide. The results suggest that turkey liver xanthine dehydrogenase, like milk xanthine oxidase (Massey & Edmonson, 1970), contains at the active centre a cyanolysable persulphide group essential to catalytic activity and that selenium may replace sulphur in this group to give an active enzyme. 4. Incubation of the native enzyme with sulphide or with selenide resulted in the rapid loss of half of the xanthine-oxidizing activity, apparently by disrupting the molybdenum and (Fe/S)II loci.
