32657214,"This research aimed at implementing and validating a method for analysis of pesticide residues in crops. QuEChERS extraction method with PSA purification was used following analyzes by gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry in Selected Reaction Monitoring mode. A short run method was successfully developed for the determination of 41 pesticides, confirmed by two precursor-products for each analyte. The calibration curve for each analyte was linear at concentration range from 1 to 500 μg kg","Journal of environmental science and health. Part.

21535682,"Mangos are a source of bioactive compounds with potential health promoting activity. Biological activities associated with mango fractions were assessed in cell-based assays to develop effective extraction and fractionation methodologies and to define sources of variability. Two techniques were developed for extraction and fractionation of mango fruit peel and flesh. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to assess compositional differences between mango fractions in flesh extracts. Many of the extracts were effective in inhibiting the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro. All fractions showed bioactivity in PPAR activation assays, but quantitative responses showed marked fruit-to-fruit variability, highlighting the need to bulk fruit prior to extraction for activity-guided fractionation of bioactive components. This study also suggests that combinations of diverse molecular components may be responsible for cell-level bioactivities from mango fractions, and that purification and activity profiling of individual components may be difficult to relate to whole fruit effects. Practical Application: Although the health benefits of fruits are strongly indicated from studies of diet and disease, it is not known what role individual fruit types can play, particularly for tropical fruits. This study shows that there is a diversity of potentially beneficial bioactivities within the flesh and peel of mango fruit, although fruit-to-fruit variation can be large. The results add to the evidence that the food approach of eating all components of fruits is likely to be more beneficial to health than consuming refined extracts, as the purification process would inevitably remove components with beneficial bioactivities.",Journal of food science,"['D000818', 'D000972', 'D001943', 'D019556', 'D049109', 'D005591', 'D002522', 'D002851', 'D005260', 'D005638', 'D017930', 'D006801', 'D031022', 'D047495', 'D008517', 'D010936', 'D011096', 'D015203', 'D021241', 'D015533']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Mangifera', 'PPAR gamma', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts', 'Polygalacturonase', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Transcriptional Activation']",Bioactivity of mango flesh and peel extracts on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ [PPARγ] activation and MCF-7 cell proliferation: fraction and fruit variability.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000188', None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000187']","[None, 'chemistry', 'drug therapy', None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'genetics', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', None, None, 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21535682,2011
