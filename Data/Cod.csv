35033615,"Organic matter from salmon farms has been shown to be assimilated by soft sediment and rocky reef communities within the ecological footprint of salmon farms. Given these findings, another question arises - What other chemicals in salmon feed may be assimilated into wild communities via organic waste from salmon farms? Here we measured a suite of organic contaminants in salmon feed, in organisms used in a controlled feeding experiment, and in reef species collected within the depositional footprint of salmon farms. Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry was used to quantify trace concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and current-use (CPUs) and historic-use pesticides (HUPs) in salmon feed imported to New Zealand. The effect of assimilation of farm-derived organic matter on contaminant profiles differed among species during the controlled feeding experiment and demonstrated that migration of individuals to a farm-associated site has the potential to increase or decrease organic contaminant concentrations. Concentrations of PCBs in Parapercis colias (blue cod), a highly resident, long-lived fish, were significantly higher at farm sites than at reference sites. While these concentrations were relatively low in a global context, this result presents blue cod as an important candidate for future monitoring of organic contaminants around point sources. PCBs and PBDEs measured in wild marine species were all below limits set by the European Union, whereas concentrations of certain HUPs, specifically dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its degradation products and endosulfan, may be of concern as a consequence of alternative anthropogenic activities. Overall, feed imported to New Zealand had relatively low levels of most organic contaminants that, at current levels, are unlikely to result in significant ecological effects to wild communities in adjacent habitats.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D000818', 'D017756', 'D017753', 'D008401', 'D055768', 'D006801', 'D009520', 'D011078', 'D012474', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Aquaculture', 'Ecosystem', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers', 'Humans', 'New Zealand', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Salmon', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Organic contaminants in imported salmon feed and their effects on reef ecosystems in New Zealand.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35033615,2022
34564164,"Biopolymers, in particular collagen and fibrinogen, are the leading materials for use in tissue engineering. When developing technology for scaffold formation, it is important to understand the properties of the source materials as well as the mechanisms that determine the formation of the scaffold structures. Both factors influence the properties of scaffolds to a great extent. Our present work aimed to identify the features of the molecular characteristics of collagens of different species origin and the changes they undergo during the enzymatic hydrolysis used for the process of scaffold formation. For this study, we used the methods of gel-penetrating chromatography, dynamic light scattering, reading IR spectra, and scanning electron microscopy. It was found that cod collagen (CC) and bovine collagen (BC) have different initial molecular weight parameters, and that, during hydrolysis, the majority of either type of protein is hydrolyzed by the proteolytic enzymes within the first minute. The differently sourced collagen samples were also hydrolyzed with the formation of two low molecular fractions: Mw ~ 10 kDa and ~20 kDa. In the case of CC, the microstructure of the final scaffolds contained denser, closely spaced fibrillar areas, while the BC-sourced scaffolds had narrow, short fibrils composed of unbound fibers of hydrolyzed collagen in their structure.",Marine drugs,"['D000818', 'D001672', 'D002417', 'D003094', 'D048389', 'D006868', 'D008855', 'D023822', 'D054457']","['Animals', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Cattle', 'Collagen', 'Gadus morhua', 'Hydrolysis', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Scaffolds']",Changes in the Molecular Characteristics of Bovine and Marine Collagen in the Presence of Proteolytic Enzymes as a Stage Used in Scaffold Formation.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34564164,2022
33793572,"The isotopic composition of inorganic carbon in otoliths (δ13Coto) can be a useful tracer of metabolic rates and a method to study ecophysiology in wild fish. We evaluated environmental and physiological sources of δ13Coto variation in Icelandic and Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod (Gadus morhua) over the years 1914-2013. Individual annual growth increments of otoliths formed at age 3 and 8 were micromilled and measured by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Simultaneously, all annual increment widths of the otoliths were measured providing a proxy of fish somatic growth. We hypothesized that changes in the physiological state of the organism, reflected by the isotopic composition of otoliths, can affect the growth rate. Using univariate and multivariate mixed-effects models we estimated conditional correlations between carbon isotopic composition and growth of fish at different levels (within individuals, between individuals, and between years), controlling for intrinsic and extrinsic effects on both otolith measurements. δ13Coto was correlated with growth within individuals and between years, which was attributed to the intrinsic effects (fish age or total length). There was no significant correlation between δ13Coto and growth between individuals, which suggests that caution is needed when interpreting δ13Coto signals. We found a significant decrease in δ13Coto through the century which was explained by the oceanic Suess effect-admixture of isotopically light carbon from fossil fuel. We calculated the proportion of the respired carbon in otolith carbonate (Cresp) using carbon isotopic composition in diet and dissolved inorganic carbon of the seawater. This approach allowed us to correct the values for each stock in relation to these two environmental baselines. Cresp was on average 0.275 and 0.295 in Icelandic and NEA stock, respectively.

Meat fraud is an economically motivated practice of covertly replacing one type of meat with a cheaper alternative raising health, safety, and ethical concerns for consumers. In this study, we implement the MasSpec Pen technology for rapid and direct meat analysis and authentication. The MasSpec Pen is an easy-to-use handheld device connected to a mass spectrometer that employs a solvent droplet for gentle chemical analysis of samples. Here, MasSpec Pen analysis was performed directly on several meat and fish types including grain-fed beef, grass-fed beef, venison, cod, halibut, Atlantic salmon, sockeye salmon, and steelhead trout, with a total analysis time of 15 s per sample. Statistical models developed with the Lasso method using a training set of samples yielded per-sample accuracies of 95% for the beef model, 100% for the beef versus venison model, and 84% for the multiclass fish model. Predictors of meat type selected included several molecules previously reported in the skeletal muscles of animals, including carnosine, anserine, succinic acid, xanthine, and taurine. When testing the models on independent test sets of samples, per-sample accuracies of 100% were achieved for all models, demonstrating the robustness of our method for unadulterated meat authentication. MasSpec Pen feasibility testing for classifying venison and grass-fed beef samples adulterated with grain-fed beef achieved per-sample prediction accuracies of 100% for both classifiers using test sets of samples. Altogether, the results obtained in this study provide compelling evidence that the MasSpec Pen technology is a powerful alternative analytical method for meat analysis and investigation of meat fraud.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002523', 'D013058', 'D008460', 'D012474', 'D013672']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Edible Grain', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Meat', 'Salmon', 'Technology']",Rapid Analysis and Authentication of Meat Using the MasSpec Pen Technology.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719440,2021

The optimization was carried on the phenanthrene enrichment medium followed by exposing it to variable environmental factors and nutritional sources. The complete decolorization of dye (50 mg/L) happened within 20 h of incubation at pH 8 and temperature 32 ± 0.2 °C under microaerophilic conditions. Decolourization was monitored with the shifting of absorbance peak in UV-Vis spectrophotometry and HPLC analysis. The physicochemical studies of effluent before and after the treatment revealed 85%, 90%, and 65% decline in BOD, COD, and TOC levels. The strain showed significant activities of azoreductase (95%), laccase (76%), and NADH-DCIP reductase (88%) at 12 h, 10 h, and 8 h of growth respectively indicating evidence for reductive cleavage of the dye. The changes in the functional groups were confirmed by the presence of new peaks in FT-IR data.

32155769,"Lutefisk is a traditional Norwegian fish dish made from dried fish, such as cod or other whitefish. In Norway and other Nordic countries, lutefisk is considered among the most popular dishes served during Christmas or other festive occasions. However, to date, little attention has been paid to this product, and available research on the quality, processing, and chemistry of lutefisk is still limited. The quality of this very delicate product, with a high pH value, depends on many factors, such as the initial quality of raw materials (stockfish), the quantity of lye used during the preparation process of lutefisk, and time during soaking in the lye and water, among others, making it challenging to both optimize processing and monitor the quality of lutefisk. In this study, four commercially available lutefisk brands (labelled as A, B, C, and D) were characterized using two online spectroscopic techniques, namely fluorescence and diffuse reflectance hyperspectral imaging, implemented on conveyor belts to mimic industrial applications. The samples were also analyzed by the use of an offline laboratory instrument based on visible/near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Three traditional measurements, including texture, water content, and pH, were also conducted on the same samples. Supervised classification PLS-DA models were built with each dataset and relationships between the spectroscopic measurements and the traditional data were investigated using canonical correlations. The spectroscopic methods, especially fluorescence spectroscopy, demonstrated high performance for the discrimination between samples of the different brands, with high correlations between the spectral and traditional measurements.

The commercially available serum substitutes are expensive and not necessarily food-grade. Identifying inexpensive food-safe alternatives to serum is crucial. By-products from food production are available in massive quantities, contain potential factors that can promote growth and are promising ingredients for serum replacement. The main goal of this study was to explore if food-grade by-product materials can be used as growth promoting agents in skeletal muscle cell culture to develop a tailor-made serum free media. Different by-products, including chicken carcass, cod backbone, eggshell membrane, egg white powder and pork plasma were enzymatically or chemically hydrolyzed. The hydrolysates in addition to lyophilized pork plasma and yeast extract were further characterized by size-exclusion chromatography, elemental combustion analysis and degree of hydrolysis. The materials were used as supplement to or replacement of commercial serum and further evaluated for their effect on metabolic activity, cell proliferation and cell cytotoxicity in muscle cells cultured in vitro. Our results indicate that none of the materials were cytotoxic to the skeletal muscle cells. Hydrolysates rich in peptides with approximately 2-15 amino acids in length were shown to improve cell growth and metabolic activity. Of all the materials tested pork plasma hydrolysates and yeast extract were the most promising. Pork plasma hydrolysates increased metabolic activity by 110% and cell proliferation with 48% when cultured in serum-free conditions for 3 days compared with control cells cultured with full serum conditions.

32115900,"Transglutaminases are a family of enzymes that catalyse the cross-linking of proteins by forming covalent bonds between lysine and glutamine residues in various polypeptides. Cross-linking reactions are involved in blood clots, skin formation, embryogenesis and apoptosis. Clinically, these enzymes appear to be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, tumours and coeliac diseases. Transglutaminases have great potential for use in the food industry because of their ability to cross-link proteins that are not normally linked. Here, a gene coding for transglutaminase from Atlantic cod was cloned into a bacterial expression vector and used to transform protein expression in a strain of Escherichia coli. The successful expression of recombinant transglutaminase protein from Atlantic cod (AcTG-1) as a soluble protein upon induction at low temperature was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis. Biochemical characterisation demonstrated that the transglutaminase was active between 0 and 65 °C, but was completely inactivated after 20-min incubation at 70 °C. Interestingly, the enzyme displayed cold-adapted features, such as temperature instability combined with high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures (8-16 °C). In addition, the enzyme had optimal activity at 50 °C, a new feature for a cold-adapted enzyme. AcTG-1 was active in the pH range from 6 to 9, with an optimum at pH 8, and required 5 mm calcium for maximum activity. Potential calcium-binding sites in the enzyme were predictable, making the enzyme an appropriate model for studying structure-function relationships in the calcium-dependent transglutaminase family. In vitro gel analysis revealed that transglutaminase cross-linked casein, collagen and gelatin. The binding of fish fillets in the presence of recombinant AcTG-1 provided further macroscopic proof for the potential application of AcTG-1 as a biological cross-linker in the food industry. Once binding occurred, fish fillets withstood further processing such as frying, boiling, freeze-thawing and chilling.

31895939,"The eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) population has been decreasing in the Baltic Sea for at least 30 years. Condition indices of the Baltic cod have decreased, and previous studies have suggested that this might be due to overfishing, predation, lower dissolved oxygen or changes in salinity. However, numerous studies from the Baltic Sea have demonstrated an ongoing thiamine deficiency in several animal classes, both invertebrates and vertebrates. The thiamine status of the eastern Baltic cod was investigated to determine if thiamine deficiency might be a factor in ongoing population declines. Thiamine concentrations were determined by chemical analyses of thiamine, thiamine monophosphate and thiamine diphosphate (combined SumT) in the liver using high performance liquid chromatography. Biochemical analyses measured the activity of the thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme transketolase to determine the proportion of apoenzymes in both liver and brain tissue. These biochemical analyses showed that 77% of the cod were thiamine deficient in the liver, of which 13% had a severe thiamine deficiency (i.e. 25% transketolase enzymes lacked thiamine diphosphate). The brain tissue of 77% of the cod showed thiamine deficiency, of which 64% showed severe thiamine deficiency. The thiamine deficiency biomarkers were investigated to find correlations to different biological parameters, such as length, weight, otolith weight, age (annuli counting) and different organ weights. The results suggested that thiamine deficiency increased with age. The SumT concentration ranged between 2.4-24 nmol/g in the liver, where the specimens with heavier otoliths had lower values of SumT (P = 0.0031). Of the cod sampled, only 2% of the specimens had a Fulton's condition factor indicating a healthy specimen, and 49% had a condition factor below 0.8, indicating poor health status.

While polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly alkyl PAHs, are often considered the main cause of observed toxic effects, other crude oil derived organic compounds are usually overlooked. In the current study, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was applied to investigate the body burden of a wide range of petrogenic compounds in Atlantic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and cod (Gadus morhua) embryos that had been exposed to sublethal doses of dispersed crude oil. Several groups of alkylated monoaromatic compounds (e.g. alkyl tetralins, indanes and alkyl benzenes), as well as highly alkylated PAHs, were found to accumulate in the fish embryos upon crude oil exposure. To investigate the toxicity of the monoaromatic compounds, two models (1-isopropyl-4-methyltetralin and 1-isopropyl-4-methylindane) were synthesized and shown to bioaccumulate and cause delayed hatching in developing embryos. Minor developmental effects, including craniofacial and jaw deformations and pericardial edemas, were also observed at the highest studied concentrations of the alkylindane.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D000818', 'D005399', 'D048388', 'D048389', 'D006838', 'D007814', 'D010578', 'D059392', 'D011084', 'D017747', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Fishes', 'Gadiformes', 'Gadus morhua', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Larva', 'Petroleum', 'Petroleum Pollution', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons', 'Seafood', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Accumulation and toxicity of monoaromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in early life stages of cod and haddock.,"[None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'physiology', 'physiology', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078960,2019

Mine tailings slurry includes fine particles <10 µm with elevated levels of metals (e.g., copper, iron) from residual mineral ore.

30622022,"Antibiotics are important contaminants that have become an increasingly big problem due to the discharge of the receiving environment. The presence of these organic based pollutants in influent wastewater can inhibit the biological processes and resist to degradation in wastewater treatment plants. Moreover, the consumption of agricultural products, irrigated with water containing antibiotic residues, leads to major harmful effects to the human body through the food chain. In this study; firstly, a conventional characterization was made in terms of COD, TOC, SS, color and of antibiotic residue characterization of untreated raw (influent) and biologically treated (effluent) water from domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants located in the Meriç-Ergene Basin. After that, photocatalytic activity test was run under visible light for selected antibiotics (Erythromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Sulphametoxasol) which were detected by HPLC MS/MS in excess amount. Finally, for the photocatalytic oxidation, a new generation NFC (Nitrogen-Floride-Carbon)-doped titanium dioxide photocatalyst, which has never been studied in the literature before, was prepared according to the sol-gel method without using thermal processing. Photocatalysts were characterized by UV-vis DRS reflectance and Laser Raman Spectra measurements. All other analyzes were made according to the standard methods. Considering the conventional characterization results; investigated domestic wastewaters exhibited moderate characteristics while industrial wastewater samples had strong characteristics in terms of COD, TOC and SS pollution in accordance with the literature. By the way, contrary to expectations, antibiotic residue results have proved that the effluent wastewater contains more antibiotics than the influent. This can be explained by the fact that, some antibiotics in domestic wastewaters are probably already trapped in feces and cannot be purified by conventional systems since they are released after biological treatment, as mentioned similar studies in the literature. Moreover, by means of 7 h NFC-doped photocatalytic oxidation under visible light, beside approximately % 62 to %79 COD and 62%-86% TOC removal, %99 to %100 removal of antibiotic residue was provided. According to these results, domestic and industrial secondary treated wastewaters in Meric-Ergene Basin can be advance treated, succesfully, with NFC-doped photocatalyst to remove antibiotic residues besides conventional pollutants.

The method is based on stepwise extraction of water-soluble and non-polar arsenic with hot water and a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol, respectively. While the water-soluble arsenicals were speciated by anion and cation exchange liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS), the non-polar arsenicals were collectively determined by ICP-MS after digestion in acid. The performance characteristics and broad application of the method were evaluated by analyzing eight commercial samples (cod, haddock, mackerel, crab, shrimp, geoduck clam, oyster, and kombu) and four reference materials (fish protein (DORM-4), lobster hepatopancreas (TORT-3), mussel tissue (SRM 2976), and hijiki seaweed (CRM 7405-a)) representing finfish, crustaceans, molluscs, and seaweed. Matrices spiked at three levels in duplicates were also analyzed. The stepwise extraction provided 76-106% extraction of the total arsenic from the test materials. The method demonstrated satisfactory repeatability for analysis of replicate extracts prepared over several days. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by analyzing reference materials certified for both total arsenic and a few arsenicals; the experimental results were 90-105% of the certified values. Comparison between the total water-soluble arsenic and the sum of the concentrations of the chromatographed species gave 80-92% mass balance. While spike recoveries of most arsenicals were in the acceptance range set by CODEX, a few species spiked into cod, haddock, and shrimp were poorly recovered due to transformation to other forms.

The Atlantic cod is a key species and a globally important food source, thus continuous monitoring of PAHs is considered highly valuable to ensure ecosystem sustainability and human food safety. PAH adducts to plasma proteins are applied as sensitive biomarkers of PAH exposure in humans and other species, thus the presence of PAH protein adducts in Atlantic cod plasma was investigated to identify PAH protein adduct biomarker candidates of exposure to PAHs. Blood plasma samples were collected from Atlantic cod (n = 66) one week after exposure by intramuscular injection of single PAHs (i.e. naphthalene and chrysene), and their corresponding dihydrodiol metabolites (i.e. (-)-(1R,2R)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-1,2-diol and (-)-(1R,2R)-1,2-dihydrochrysene-1,2-diol). The samples were analyzed by shotgun tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and the resulting MS data were analyzed in Byonic™ to screen for proteins susceptible to adduct formation with naphthalene and chrysene. Furthermore, a wildcard modification search was performed to obtain additional information regarding potential modifications other than the targeted metabolites.

Concentrated sulfuric acid was used to remove lipids and to separate dicofol from DCBP. On-column injection was used as an alternative to splitless injection to protect dicofol from thermal decomposition. By the method presented herein, it is possible to quantify dicofol and DCBP in the same samples. Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) were spiked at two dose levels and the recoveries were determined. The mean recovery for dicofol was 65% at the low dose (1 ng) and 77% at the high dose (10 ng). The mean recovery for DCBP was 99% at the low dose (9.2 ng) and 146% at the high dose (46 ng).

28183064,"PCB 153 is one of the most abundant PCB congeners detected in biological samples. It is a persistent compound that is still present in the environment despite the ban on production and use of PCBs in the late 1970s. It has strong tendencies to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in biota, and studies have suggested that it is an endocrine and metabolic disruptor. In order to study mechanisms of toxicity, we exposed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) to various doses of PCB 153 (0, 0.5, 2 and 8mg/kg body weight) for two weeks and examined the effects on expression of liver proteins using label-free quantitative proteomics. Label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the liver proteome resulted in the quantification of 1272 proteins, of which 78 proteins were differentially regulated in the PCB 153-treated dose groups compared to the control group. Functional enrichment analysis showed that pathways significantly affected are related to lipid metabolism, cytoskeletal remodeling, cell cycle and cell adhesion. Importantly, the main effects appear to be on lipid metabolism, with up-regulation of enzymes in the de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway, consistent with previous transcriptomics results. Increased plasma triglyceride levels were also observed in the PCB 153 treated fish, in agreement with the induction of the lipogenic genes and proteins. The results suggest that PCB 153 perturbs lipid metabolism in the Atlantic cod liver.

27427887,"A hybrid approach for the remediation of recalcitrant dye wastewater is proposed. The chlorine-mediated electrochemical oxidation of real textile effluents and synthetic samples (using Ti/IrO2-RuO2-TiO2 anodes), lead to discoloration by 92% and 89%, respectively, in 100min, without significant mineralization. The remediation was obtained through biodegradation, after removing the residual bio-toxic active chlorine species via sunlight exposition. Results show that the electrochemical discoloration enhances the effluent biodegradability with about 90% COD removal employing acclimatized naphthalene-degrading bacterial consortia, within 144h. Based on results obtained through FT-IR and GC-MS, it is likely that azo group stripping and oxidative cleavage of dyes occur due to the nucleophilic attack of active chlorine species during electro-oxidation. This leads to generation of aromatic intermediates which are further desulfonated, deaminated or oxidized only at their functional groups. These aromatic intermediates were mineralized into simpler organic acids and aldehydes by bacterial consortia. Phyto-toxicity trials on Vigna radiata confirmed the toxic nature of the untreated dye solutions. An increase in root and shoot development was observed with the electrochemically treated solutions, the same was higher in case of bio-treated solutions. Overall, obtained results confirm the capability of the proposed hybrid oxidation scheme for the remediation of textile wastewater.

26689660,"Rising organic matter concentrations in surface waters in many Nordic countries require current drinking water treatment processes to be adapted. Accordingly, the use of a novel nanofiltration (NF) membrane was studied during a nine month period in pilot scale at a large drinking water treatment plant in Stockholm, Sweden. A chemically resistant hollow-fibre NF membrane was fed with full scale process water from a rapid sand filter after aluminum sulfate coagulation. The combined coagulation and NF process removed more than 90% of the incoming lake water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (8.7 mg C L(-1)), and 96% of the absorbance at 254 nm (A254) (0.28 cm(-1) incoming absorbance). Including granulated active carbon GAC) filter, the complete pilot plant treatment process we observed decreases in DOC concentration (8.7-0.5 mg C L(-1)), SUVA (3.1-1.7 mg(-1) L m(-1)), and the average nominal molecular mass (670-440 Da). Meanwhile, water hardness was practically unaffected (<20% reduction). Humic substances (HS) and biopolymers were almost completely eliminated (6510-140 and 260 to 10 μg C L(-1) respectively) and low molecular weight (LMW) neutrals decreased substantially (880-190 μg C L(-1)). Differential excitation emission matrices (EEMs), which illustrate the removal of fluorescing organic matter (FDOM) over a range of excitation and emission wavelengths, demonstrate that coagulation removed 35 ± 2% of protein-like material and 65 ± 2% of longer emission wavelength, humic-like FDOM. The subsequent NF treatment was somewhat less selective but still preferentially targeted humic-like FDOM (83 ± 1%) to a larger extent than protein-like material (66 ± 3%). The high selectivity of organic matter during coagulation compared to NF separation was confirmed from analyses with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), and liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD), as coagulation exclusively targeted oxidized organic matter components while NF removed both chemically reduced and oxidized components. DOC removal and change in DOC character in the GAC filters showed marked differences with slower saturation and more pronounced shifts in DOC character using NF as pre-treatment. Fluorescence derived parameters showed a similar decrease over time of GAC performance for the first 150 days but also indicated ongoing change of DOM character in the post NF GAC filtrate over time even after LC-OCD indicated steady state with respect to outgoing carbon. During our trial iron concentrations were low (<30 ppb) and thus A254 could be directly related to the concentration of HS (R(2) = 0.9). The fluorescence derived freshness index (β:α) proved to be an excellent variable for estimating the fraction of HS present in all samples. Given the recommended limit of 4 mg L(-1) for chemical oxygen demand (COD) for Swedish drinking water, coagulation will need to be supplemented with one or more treatment steps irrespective whether climate change will lead to drier or wetter conditions in order to maintain sufficient DOC removal with the current increasing concentrations in raw waters.

Both methods utilize liquid extraction (LE) prior to a clean-up step using either normal phase solid phase extraction (SPE) or mixed-phase dispersive SPE (dSPE). Optimization of the methods was achieved by comparing the type and amount of sorbents, drying agents, and solvents used. In order to improve the limits of detection (LOD) of target PAHs under high sensitivity gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, specific emphasis was given to minimizing lipid co-extraction. The optimized LE-SPE method comprised extraction with dichloromethane/n-hexane (1:1, v/v) and clean-up by silica SPE, whereas the optimized LE-dSPE method comprised extraction with acetonitrile and clean-up with PSA and C18 sorbents. The methods were validated and directly compared through the analysis of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) eggs exposed to oil. The LE-SPE method resulted in lower levels of co-extracted lipids (14.1 ± 1.7 ng/μL) than the LE-dSPE method (60 ± 14 ng/μL).

26204083,"The oxidation of ibuprofen (IBP) in water was evaluated using oxidative treatments: ozonation, sonication, hydrogen peroxide addition and combinations of these processes. After 20 minutes of treatment, ozone coupled with hydrogen peroxide at pH 7, 15 °C, an ozone dose of 16 mg/L and a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 7.1 mg/L was found to have the highest IBP (95%) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (41%) removals. A synergistic effect was observed for the combined ozonation/sonication process, which might be explained by an improved mass transfer of ozone in the solution due to the presence of ultrasonic pressure waves. Transformation products were detected in the treated solutions. The nature of five of these products was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), including 4-isobutylacetophenone (4-IBAP), oxo-IBP, 4-acetylbenzoic acid, 4-ethybenzaldehyde and oxalic acid. In addition, COD analyses for each experiment showed that the ratio of %COD removal to %IBP removal was highest with sonication; suggesting that this oxidative process offers other mechanisms of removal which may lead to further degradation of products formed. This study presents the first data on removal of IBP by sonication coupled to ozonation and provides some insight into the potential of this combined treatment approach for the removal of contaminants of emerging concern.

It uses a simple water extraction of formaldehyde which is then derivatised with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) to form a sensitive and specific chromophore for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection. Although this formaldehyde derivative has been widely used in past tissue analysis, this paper describes an improved derivatisation procedure. The formation of the DNPH formaldehyde derivative has been shortened to 2 min and a stabilising buffer has been added to the derivative to increase its stability. The average recovery of free formaldehyde in spiked cod was 63% with an RSD of 15% over the range of 25-200 mg kg(-1) (n = 48).

The arsenic concentrations in the lipid fractions ranged from 1.8 to 16.4mg As/kg oil of liver, and a linear correlation (r(2)=0.80, p<0.001) was observed between the total arsenic concentrations in liver and the total arsenic concentrations in the respective lipid fractions of the same livers. The relative proportion of arsenolipids was considerably lower in liver samples with high total arsenic levels (33-240mg/kg ww), which contained from 3 to 7% of the total arsenic in the lipid-soluble fraction. In contrast liver samples with low arsenic concentrations (2.1-33mg/kg ww) contained up to 50% of the total arsenic as lipid-soluble species. Arsenic speciation analysis of the lipid-soluble fractions of the livers, using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS), revealed the presence of several arsenolipids.

Higher current, acidic pH and 0.8-1.2 g L(-1) NaCl dose had an enhancing effect on the removal efficiencies. Interaction effect of the variables highlights the action of (•)OH and HOCl in the oxidation of methyl orange, where HOCl has effect at lower current range.

The catalysts could be easily recovered by phase separation and were used up to 5 times without any significant loss in activity and 1-octene conversion. Very high yields of the expected aldehydes were obtained without addition of any phase transfer agents, co-solvents or hydrophobic ligands. Excellent aldehyde chemoselectivity is observed for all the catalysts but this varied each time the catalysts were recycled, with the formation of a small amount of internal olefins.

25129707,"Although diverse methods exist for treating polluted water, the most promising and innovating technology is the electrochemical remediation process. This paper presents the anodic oxidation of real produced water (PW), generated by the petroleum exploration of the Petrobras plant-Tunisia. Experiments were conducted at different current densities (30, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2)) using the lead dioxide supported on tantalum (Ta/PbO2) and boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes in an electrolytic batch cell. The electrolytic process was monitored by the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the residual total petroleum hydrocarbon [TPH] in order to know the feasibility of electrochemical treatment. The characterization and quantification of petroleum wastewater components were performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The COD removal was approximately 85% and 96% using PbO2 and BDD reached after 11 and 7h, respectively. Compared with PbO2, the BDD anode showed a better performance to remove petroleum hydrocarbons compounds from produced water. It provided a higher oxidation rate and it consumed lower energy. However, the energy consumption and process time make useless anodic oxidation for the complete elimination of pollutants from PW. Cytotoxicity has shown that electrochemical oxidation using BDD could be efficiently used to reduce more than 90% of hydrocarbons compounds.

From batch and continuous experiments it has been proved that both versions of the Fenton process lead to quite similar results in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon reduction although the COD shows a slightly higher rate in the early stages of reaction. COD reductions of around 55% after 2 h reaction time and 75-80% with 4 h residence time were reached in batch and continuous experiments, respectively, conducted at pH around 3, ambient temperature (20 °C), with 200 mg/L of Fe dose and an initial H₂O₂/COD weight ratio corresponding to the theoretical stoichiometric value. Achieving the locally allowable limit of COD for industrial wastewater discharge into the municipal sewer system takes no more than 30 min reaction time under those conditions by both Fenton systems. However, the Fenton-like process, where iron is fed as Fe(3+), would be preferable for industrial applications since the ferric sludge resulting upon final neutralization of the effluent can be recycled to the process.

24928732,"Interpretation of plasma cortisol levels in wild-caught fish is confounded by the stress of capture. Measurement of cortisol metabolites in fish bile could provide a method for assessing the stress level of wild fish because the time-lag for metabolism, conjugation and excretion into bile avoids the effects of sampling stress. To determine which biliary metabolite(s) to target, four Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L., were injected with radioactive cortisol. After 22 h, the bile was collected and found to contain 30% of the injected activity. Cortisol metabolites were extracted from diluted bile samples using solid phase extraction and the radioactive metabolites separated by several different chromatographic procedures. The metabolites were predominantly present as sulfates (95%) with the remainder being glucuronidated. Chromatography split the sulfates into at least seven peaks, and acid solvolysis (which removes sulfate groups from steroids) generated four major radioactive steroids. These were identified, using microchemical reactions and re-crystallization to constant specific activity, as: 11β,17,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (cortisol), 3α,11β,17,21-tetrahydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one (tetrahydrocortisol; THF), 3α,17,21-trihydroxy-5β-pregnane-11,20-dione (tetrahydrocortisone; THE) and 3α,17,20β,21-tetrahydroxy-5β-pregnan-11-one (β-cortolone). The last of these was the most abundant, and thus a likely target for a biliary stress assay. Studies were also carried out to determine the best method for extraction and solvolysis of sulfates. Solid phase extraction (i.e. using octadecylsilane) was found to be too unreliable for routine use. Even though the extraction efficiency could be improved by acidifying the bile, this caused premature solvolysis of sulfated steroids. Acid solvolysis of unextracted bile worked best (c. 90% converted to free steroids) on volumes that were 1 μL or lower. Aryl sulfatase digestion of unextracted bile did not work well (only 20% of radioactivity was converted to free steroids).",Steroids,"['D000818', 'D001646', 'D003460', 'D048389', 'D006854', 'D006868', 'D011278', 'D012997', 'D013431', 'D014316']","['Animals', 'Bile', 'Crystallization', 'Gadus morhua', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hydrolysis', 'Pregnanes', 'Solvents', 'Sulfates', 'Tritium']",Identification of cortisol metabolites in the bile of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'blood', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928732,2015

Here, a new non-contact UV-Vis spectroscopic approach for monitoring contaminants in water, and especially wastewater, is proposed. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was applied to measure simultaneously the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity (TUR) concentrations in water. The measurements were carried out in the wavelength range from 200-1100 nm. The measured spectra were analysed using partial-least-squares (PLS) regression. The correlation coefficient between the measured and the reference concentrations of COD and TUR in the water samples were R(2) = 0.85 and 0.96, respectively. These results highlight the potential of non-contact UV-Vis spectroscopy for the assessment of water contamination.

Thirty-five protein spots were found to respond to MeHg exposure, and 13 of these were identified when searching cod-specific databases with acquired mass spectrometry data. Among the identified thiol-containing proteins, some are known to respond to MeHg treatment, including constituents of the cytoskeleton, and proteins involved in oxidative stress responses, protein synthesis, protein folding, and energy metabolism. Methylmercury also appeared to affect cod heme metabolism/turnover, producing significantly altered levels of hemoglobin and hemopexin in liver following metal exposure. The latter finding suggests that MeHg may also affect the hematological system in Atlantic cod. ",Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

24607114,"Arsenolipids are the major arsenic species present in marine oils. Several structures of arsenolipids have been elucidated the last 5 years, demonstrating the chemical complexity of this trace element in the marine environment. Several commercial fish oils and marine oils, ranging in total arsenic concentrations from 1.6 to 12.5 mg kg(-1) oil, were analyzed for arsenolipids using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). The arsenolipids were quantified using three different arsenic-containing calibration standards; dimethylarsinate (DMA), triphenylarsinoxide (Ph₃AsO) and a synthesized arsenic-containing hydrocarbon (AsHC) (dimethylarsinoyl nonadecane; C₂₁H₄₃AsO). The observed variation in signal intensity for arsenic during the gradient elution profile in reversed-phase HPLC was compensated for by determining the time-resolved response factors for the arsenolipids. Isotopes of germanium ((74)Ge) and indium ((115)In) were suited as internal standards for arsenic, and were used for verification of the arsenic signal response factors during the gradient elution. Dimethylarsinate was the most suitable calibration standard for the quantification of arsenolipids, with recoveries between 91% and 104% compared to total arsenic measurements in the same extracts. A range of marine oils was investigated, including oils of several fish species, cod liver and seal, as well as three commercial fish oils. The AsHCs - C₁₇H₃₈AsO, C₁₉H₄₂AsO and C₂₃H₃₈AsO - were identified as the major arsenolipids in the extracts of all oils by HPLC coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (qTOF-MS). Minor amounts of two arsenic-containing fatty acids (AsFAs) (C₂₃H₃₈AsO₃ and C₂₄H₃₈AsO₃) were also detected in the oils. The sum of the AsHCs and the AsFAs determined in the present study accounted for 17-42% of the total arsenic in the oils.",Talanta,"['D001151', 'D002851', 'D005227', 'D005395', 'D006838', 'D013058']","['Arsenic', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fish Oils', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Mass Spectrometry']",Arsenic-containing fatty acids and hydrocarbons in marine oils - determination using reversed-phase HPLC-ICP-MS and HPLC-qTOF-MS.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607114,2014
24492050,"The granuloma disease caused by Francisella noatunensis subsp. noatunensis in farmed Atlantic cod has not been successfully treated by use of antibacterials, even when antibacterial resistance testing indicates a sufficient effect. The reason for this treatment failure may be the intracellular existence of the bacteria within immune cells, mainly macrophages. To investigate the effect of antibacterials on intracellular Francisella replication, we established a protocol for the detection of drugs within Atlantic cod immune cells using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). When the uptake and intracellular concentrations of oxolinic acid and flumequine were analysed in isolated adherent head kidney leucocytes (HKLs) by HPLC, we found that uptake was rapid and the intracellular concentrations reflected the extracellular exposure concentrations. To investigate the effect of the antibacterial compounds on intracellular bacterial replication, adherent HKLs experimentally infected with the bacteria were analysed using flow cytometry and intracellular labelling of bacteria by specific antibodies. We found that flumequine did not inhibit intracellular bacterial replication. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that the intracellularly effiacy of the drug was reduced. The HPLC method used proved to be highly applicable for accurate determination of intracellular drug concentrations. When combined with sensitive and specific flow cytometry analyses for identification and measurement of intracellular bacterial replication, we suggest that this approach can be very valuable for the design of antibacterial treatments of intracellular pathogens.

24112628,"Nano zero valent iron (NZVI), although being increasingly used for environmental remediation, has potential negative impact on methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion. In this study, NZVI (average size = 55 ± 11 nm) showed inhibition of methanogenesis due to its disruption of cell integrity. The inhibition was coincident with the fast hydrogen production and accumulation due to NZVI dissolution under anaerobic conditions. At the concentrations of 1 mM and above, NZVI reduced methane production by more than 20%. At the concentration of 30 mM, NZVI led to a significant increase in soluble COD (an indication of cell disruption) and volatile fatty acids in the mixed liquor along with an accumulation of H2, resulting in a reduction of methane production by 69% (±4% [standard deviation]). By adding a specific methanogenesis inhibitor-sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) to the anaerobic sludge containing 30 mM NZVI, the amount of H2 produced was only 79% (±1%) of that with heat-killed sludge, indicating the occurrence of bacterially controlled hydrogen utilization processes. Quantitative PCR data was in accordance with the result of methanogenesis inhibition, as the level of methanogenic population (dominated by Methanosaeta) in the presence of 30 mM NZVI decreased significantly compared to that of the control. On the contrary, ZVI powder (average size <212 μm) at the same concentration (30 mM) increased methane production presumably due to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis of hydrogen gas that was slowly released from the NZVI powder. While it is a known fact that NZVI disrupts cell membranes, which inhibited methanogenesis described herein, the results suggest that the rapid hydrogen production due to NZVI dissolution also contribute to methanogenesis inhibition and lead to bacterially controlled hydrogenotrophic processes.",Water research,"['D019342', 'D000693', 'D001419', 'D001673', 'D057919', 'D005232', 'D006859', 'D006863', 'D007501', 'D008697', 'D053758', 'D012722', 'D013052']","['Acetic Acid', 'Anaerobiosis', 'Bacteria', 'Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis', 'Fatty Acids, Volatile', 'Hydrogen', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Iron', 'Methane', 'Nanoparticles', 'Sewage', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission']",Impact of nano zero valent iron (NZVI) on methanogenic activity and population dynamics in anaerobic digestion.,"['Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000254', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000382', None]","['metabolism', 'drug effects', 'growth & development', 'drug effects', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'microbiology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24112628,2014

Degradation products were identified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) and UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS analyses. A simple mechanism of degradation for different AOP was proposed. Thirteen products were identified during all degradations for both pesticides. It was assumed that the oxidation mechanisms in the all four technologies were not based only on the production and use of the hydroxyl radical, but they also included other kinds of oxidation mechanisms specific for each technology. Similarity was observed between degradation mechanism of ozonation and DBD. The greatest difference in the products was found in Fenton degradation which included the opening of benzene ring. When degraded with same AOP pesticides gave at the end of treatment the same products. Global toxicity and COD value of samples was determined after all degradations. Real water sample was used to study influence of organic matter on pesticide degradation. These results could lead to accurate estimates of the overall effects of triketone herbicides on environmental ecosystems and also contributed to the development of improved removal processes.

We employed multivariate factor-analysis tools, including principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares (PLS) regression, to study the effects of cooking weight loss and levels of creatine, glucose, and free amino acids on HCA levels. The highest concentrations of mutagenic HCAs, 159.3 ng·g(-1) total, where 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) accounted for 121 ng·g(-1), were found in fried swordfish (cooking loss of 51.8%).

Chemometric analysis showed that the fish species is the most influential parameter on the formation of HCAs such as DMIP, PhIP, and norharman.

23620370,"The present study describes the use of a simple solid-phase extraction procedure for the extraction of arsenic-containing hydrocarbons from fish oil followed by analysis using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The procedure permitted the analysis of a small sample amount, and the method was applied on a range of different commercial fish oils, including oils of anchovy (Engraulis ringens), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), sand eel (Ammodytes marinus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and a commercial mixed fish oil (mix of oils of Atlantic herring, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens)). Total arsenic concentrations in the fish oils and in the extracts of the fish oils were determined by microwave-assisted acid digestion and ICPMS. The arsenic concentrations in the fish oils ranged from 5.9 to 8.7 mg kg(-1). Three dominant arsenic-containing hydrocarbons in addition to one minor unidentified compound were detected in all the oils using GC-ICPMS. The molecular structures of the arsenic-containing hydrocarbons, dimethylarsinoyl hydrocarbons (C17H38AsO, C19H42AsO, C23H38AsO), were verified using GC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and the accurate masses of the compounds were verified using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (qTOF-MS). Additionally, total arsenic and the arsenic-containing hydrocarbons were studied in decontaminated and in non-decontaminated fish oils, where a reduced arsenic concentration was seen in the decontaminated fish oils. This provided an insight to how a decontamination procedure originally ascribed for the removal of persistent organic pollutants affects the level of arsenolipids present in fish oils.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D001151', 'D004340', 'D005395', 'D008401', 'D006838', 'D015394']","['Arsenic', 'Drug Contamination', 'Fish Oils', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Molecular Structure']",Detection of arsenic-containing hydrocarbons in a range of commercial fish oils by GC-ICPMS analysis.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23620370,2013

We report the characterization of two galectin-1 proteins from Atlantic cod, with emphasis on mucosal tissues. Tissue distribution of these two ≈14kDa galectin-1 proteins (Codgal1-1 and Codgal1-2) was ascertained by western blotting of one dimensional (1D) and two dimensional (2DE) gels. The two galectin-1 proteins were differentially localized in the mucosal tissues of cod. Codgal1-1 was predominantly localized in the basal cells of skin and this protein was present in all the early developmental stages examined, indicating a likely involvement in developmental processes. The two lectins were also localized in the adherent macrophage-like cells (MLC) from cod head kidney and results gathered indicate their possible secretion during Francisella noatunensis infection, suggesting that they are active components of immune defence. Lactose affinity chromatography coupled with gel filtration co-purified the two cod galectin-1 proteins, which hemagglutinated horse red blood cells in a lactose inhibitable manner.

23291252,"Primary head kidney leukocytes from Atlantic cod were isolated to evaluate the use of arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid by cyclooxygenases and the production of prostaglandins E₂ and E₃. The expression of cyclooxygenase genes and selected interleukin genes like Interleukin 1β, Interleukin 6, interleukin 8 and interleukin 10 were monitored. Increasing concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid in equal amounts increased cyclooxygenase2 transcription as well as cell secretion of prostaglandin E₂. Even though the ratio of the two fatty acids was 1:1, the ratio between prostaglandin E₂ and E₃ was 50:1. The addition of arachidonic acid alone increased prostaglandin E₂ secretion but did not induce cyclooxygenase2 transcription. However, when the concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid was increased, maintaining arachidonic acid constant, both prostaglandin E₃ and prostaglandin E₂ production was induced and the prostaglandin E₂ production was higher than in cell cultures only added arachidonic acid. An up-regulation of cyclooxygenase2 transcription was also observed. The addition of the two fatty acids also affected the immune response by alteration of leukocytic cytokines gene expression. According to our results the Cyclooxygenase in cod seem to prefer arachidonic acid as substrate. Therefore, we suggest that the shift from marine oils (rich in n-3 fatty acids) to plant oils (higher in n-6 fatty acids) in the diet of commercially reared Atlantic cod could have negative effects on the whole organism through the increase in the production of prostaglandins belonging to those derived from n-6 fatty acids.",Fish & shellfish immunology,"['D000527', 'D000821', 'D000818', 'D016718', 'D002853', 'D016207', 'D015232', 'D004305', 'D015118', 'D005231', 'D029941', 'D048389', 'D020869', 'D005786', 'D015971', 'D060226', 'D007962', 'D013058', 'D011451', 'D060888']","['Alprostadil', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cytokines', 'Dinoprostone', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Fish Proteins', 'Gadus morhua', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Head Kidney', 'Leukocytes', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",Cytokine gene expression and prostaglandin production in head kidney leukocytes isolated from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) added different levels of arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid.,"['Q000031', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000378', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None]","['analogs & derivatives', 'analysis', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'genetics', 'metabolism', None, 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', 'genetics', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23291252,2013

It was based on the microextraction of the stereoisomers with a supramolecular solvent (SUPRAS) made up of reverse aggregates of decanoic acid (DeA). The procedure involved the stirring of the fish sample (750 mg) with 600 μL of SUPRAS for five minutes, subsequent centrifugation for extract separation from matrix components and direct analysis of the extract after dilution 1:1 with methanol. Individual enantiomers of α-, β- and γ-HBCD were separated on a chiral stationary phase of β-cyclodextrin and quantified by monitoring of the [M-H](-)→Br(-) transition at m/z 640.9→80.9. Driving forces for the microextraction of HBCD in the SUPRAS involved both dispersion and dipole-dipole interactions.

Chemical oxygen demand (COD) ranged between 2621 and 16,832 mg L(-1), and COD in the dry season was twice the level in the rainy season owing to reduced rainwater input and significant evaporation. COD, pH, and the concentrations of ammonium ion, and metals in the leachate were within acceptable ranges for decomposition by anaerobic digestion. However, the Na(+) and Cl(-) in the leachate are high enough to inhibit anaerobic digestion. From chemical investigation of leachate at six monitoring wells in Benowo, food waste accumulation and seawater intrusion might cause high salinity in the leachate. In the continuous experiment, COD removal efficiency was maintained at 40% regardless of OLR, suggesting that at least 40% of the leachate contained biodegradable substances.

22766882,"Olive mill wastewater (OMW) results from the production of olive oil, which is an important traditional agro-industry in Mediterranean countries. In continuous three-phase centrifugation 1.0-1.2 m(3) of OMW are produced per ton of processed olives. Discharge of OMW is of serious environmental concern due to its high content of organic matter with phytotoxic properties, namely phenolic compounds. Meanwhile, drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS) is produced in high amounts and has long been considered as a waste for landfill. The aim of this work was the assessment of reusing DWTS for OMW treatment. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was carried out to determine the phenolic compounds present and to evaluate if they are recalcitrant. Treatability assays were performed using a dosage of DWTS from 50 to 300 g L(-1). Treatment efficiency was evaluated based on the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total solids (TS), total suspended solids (TSS), total volatile solids (TVS), oil and grease (OG), phenols (total phosphorous (TP) and HPLC fraction). Results from OMW HPLC characterization identified a total of 13 compounds; the major ones were hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, caffeic acid, p-cumaric acid and oleuropein. Treatability assays led to a maximum reduction of about 90% of some of the phenolic compounds determined by HPLC. Addition of 200-300 g L(-1) of DWTS reduced 40-50% of COD, 45-50% of TP, a maximum of nearly 70% TSS and 45% for TS and TVS. The OG fraction showed a reduction of about 90%, achieved adding 300 g L(-1) od DWTS. This study points out the possibility of establishing an integrated management of OMW and DWTS, contributing to a decrease in the environmental impact of two industrial activities, olive oil production and drinking water treatment.",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,"['D057919', 'D060766', 'D005525', 'D007220', 'D000069463', 'D010938', 'D059027', 'D014865', 'D014874', 'D018508']","['Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis', 'Drinking Water', 'Food-Processing Industry', 'Industrial Waste', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Recycling', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Water Purification']",Reuse of drinking water treatment sludge for olive oil mill wastewater treatment.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'methods', 'methods', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22766882,2012
22731120,"Organosulfates have been proposed as products of secondary organic aerosol formation. While organosulfates have been identified in ambient aerosol samples, a question remains as to the magnitude of their contribution to particulate organic mass. At the same time, discrepancies have been observed between total particulate sulfur measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and sulfur present as inorganic sulfate measured by ion chromatography (IC) in fine particulate matter. These differences could be attributed to measurement bias and/or the contribution of other sulfur compounds, including organosulfates. Using the National Park Service IMPROVE PM(2.5) database, we examined the disparity between the sulfur and sulfate measurements at 12 sites across the United States to provide upper-bound estimates for the annual average contributions of organosulfates to organic mass. The data set consists of over 150000 measurements. The 12 sites include Brigantine, NJ, Cape Cod, MA, Washington, DC, Chassahowitzka, FL, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, NC, Okefenokee, GA, Bondville, IL, Mingo, MO, Phoenix, AZ, San Gabriel, CA, Crater Lake National Park, OR, and Spokane, WA. These sites are representative of the different regions of the country: Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and Northwest.

22641114,"Understanding pathogen recognition and mechanisms in Atlantic cod are of significant importance for both basic research on wild populations and health management in aquaculture. A microarray approach was utilized to search for effects of viral (polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid), bacterial (lipopolysaccharide) and polyclonal activator (phytohaemoagglutinin) stress in Atlantic cod head kidney cells. LPS cell activation increased mRNA expression of interleukin 8; interleukin-1β; cyclooxygenase 2; leukocyte derived chemotaxin 2; carboxyl-esterase 2 and environmental biomarker cytochrome P450 1A. Mitogen activated protein kinase p38 and cathepsin F were down regulated by LPS. The antiviral responses induced by double stranded RNA clearly increased transcription of Toll like receptor 3 and interferon stimulating gene 15. The phytohaemoagglutinin response seemed to be more non-specific. Special for the phytohaemoagglutinin induction was the increase in major histocompatibility complex class I. CC chemokine type 2 mRNA expression was increased by phytohaemoagglutinin, lipopolysaccharide and polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid, while mitogen activated protein kinase p38 and leukocyte derived chemotaxin 2 were down regulated by phytohaemoagglutinin. Oxidative stress related genes like catalase and glutaredoxin and the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 showed no transcriptional changes compared to control in any of the treatments. Eicosanoids like prostaglandin 2, leukotriene B4 and B5 were constitutively produced by cod head kidney cells in vitro. The most remarkable feature of eicosanoid secretion is the higher production of leukotrienes against prostaglandins, indicating that the lipooxygenase pathway is preferred over the cyclooxygenase pathway. Although there were no significant differences in eicosanoid secretion between the groups, polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid showed a clear tendency to increase the levels of leukotriene B4 and B5. This study reveals distinct signatures of bacteria and virus transcriptional responses in cod head kidney cells. In addition, the novel finding that cytochrome P450 1A was upregulated during the antibacterial response indicates a connection between immunity and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in Atlantic cod.",Fish & shellfish immunology,"['D000818', 'D001419', 'D002478', 'D002853', 'D015777', 'D029941', 'D048389', 'D020869', 'D005786', 'D060226', 'D054884', 'D008070', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D046228', 'D010835', 'D011070', 'D015398', 'D014780']","['Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Eicosanoids', 'Fish Proteins', 'Gadus morhua', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Head Kidney', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Poly I-C', 'Signal Transduction', 'Viruses']",Pathogen recognition and mechanisms in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) head kidney cells: bacteria (LPS) and virus (poly I:C) signals through different pathways and affect distinct genes.,"[None, 'Q000276', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000276', None, None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000276', None, 'Q000276']","[None, 'immunology', None, None, 'analysis', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'drug effects', 'cytology', None, 'immunology', None, None, None, 'pharmacology', 'immunology', None, 'immunology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22641114,2012

Individual bacterial isolates exhibited a remarkable color-removal capability against crystal violet (50 mg/L) and malachite green (50 mg/L) dyes within 24 h. Interestingly, the microbial consortium CM-4 shows a high decolorizing percentage for crystal violet and malachite green, respectively, 91% and 99% within 2 h. The rate of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal increases after 24 h, reaching 61.5% and 84.2% for crystal violet and malachite green, respectively. UV-Visible absorption spectra, FTIR analysis and the inspection of bacterial cells growth indicated that color removal by the CM-4 was due to biodegradation. Evaluation of mutagenicity by using Salmonella typhimurium test strains, TA98 and TA100 studies revealed that the degradation of crystal violet and malachite green by CM-4 did not lead to mutagenic products.

These isozymes were named P-450a-d and described with regard to optical properties, enzymatic activity, molecular weight and immunological reactivity. Subsequent analyses of the individual CYP fractions have shown that P-450c corresponds to a CYP1A isozyme, and immunochemical analyses have indicated that P-450b belongs to the CYP3A subfamily. However, no sequence data has been obtained to confirm these results, and the identities of the P-450a and P-450d have also remained unknown. The sequencing effort of the cod genome and expanding cod EST-databases (www.codgenome.no) have substantially increased the number of protein sequences available from cod. Mass spectrometric techniques were therefore applied to further characterize the proteins in historically archived samples of P-450a-d fractions. These analyses revealed large heterogeneities of CYPs within the purified samples. The most prominent CYP isozymes present include members of the CYP1A, CYP1C, CYP3A and CYP4V families. In total, 29 unique CYPs belonging to 9 CYP gene families and 15 subfamilies were identified with mass spectrometry.

24786250,"In 2009, a survey of 177 samples of fish and fishery products from the markets in Seoul was carried out to investigate total mercury and organic mercury (methylmercury) concentrations and to establish a correlation, if any, between total and organic mercury levels. Concentrations of total and organic mercury in canned tuna ranged 0.001-2.581 and 0.003-1.307 mg/kg, respectively; those for fish, such as cod or salmon, ranged 0.012-2.529 and 0.021-0.507 mg/kg, respectively. Ethylmercury was not detected. More than 50% of total mercury in the samples existed as organic mercury. The correlation coefficients (r(2)) between total mercury and methylmercury concentrations of fish and fishery products found to have methylmercury were 0.844 and 0.976, respectively, which was statistically significant. There was a higher correlation in fishery products than in fish. Although there was no product in which mercury exceeded the standard set by the Food Code in 2008, with the exception of marlin steak, a processed food, which contained 1.307 mg/kg methylmercury. None exceeded the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) for mercury. Collectively, the results indicate that fish or fishery products marketed in Seoul, with the exception of marlin, have low levels of total or organic mercury and, thus, intake of these products is not a risk to public health.","Food additives & contaminants.

Therefore the well water from the 60 m deep water layer situated near the city of Osijek (Eastern Croatia) with elevated values of heavy metals, color, turbidity, suspended solids, ammonia and organic contaminants was processed. Due to the complex composition of the treated water, the purification system required the combination of electroreduction/electrocoagulation, using iron and aluminum electrode plates followed by the simultaneous ozonation/UV treatment. The electroreduction/electrocoagulation approach was used for the removal of heavy metals, suspended solids, color and turbidity, while the organic contaminants and ammonia were removed by the ozonation/UV treatment. All measured parameters in the purified water were significantly lower compared to the regulated values. Under the optimum treatment conditions, the removal efficiencies for color, turbidity, nickel and arsenic were 100%. The removal efficiencies of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, ammonia, fluorides, sulfates and COD were 94.5%, 96.0%, 98.3%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 97.8%, 96.7%, 96,7%, 93.4%, 51.4%, 72.2% and 93.8%, respectively, increasing with the increased initial concentrations.","Journal of environmental science and health.

Models are therefore needed that can simulate the effects of accidental oil spills on early life stages of these fish. In this study, we combined an individual based model and a microcosm approach to infer effects of the water soluble fraction (WSF) and of an oil dispersion (WSF and droplets) on two key endpoints of North East Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae: food assimilation rate and survival probability. Both exposure types (WSF and dispersion) decreased assimilation rate (control: 0.4 d(-1)) and survival probability (control: 0.96) in a concentration-dependent fashion, with EC(50)s of about 2 (feeding) and 40 μg/L ∑PAH in the WSF (survival probability). No consistent differences were found between the ECs from the two exposure types indicating no additional oil droplet effects in the oil dispersion. During post exposure, effects on the two endpoints disappeared, which was confirmed by an image analyses we performed of gut content fluorescence. Our results also show that the larvae model fitted the experimental data from the two exposure types equally well, indicating that the presence of oil droplets did not affect model performance.

21963436,"Previous characterization of a native lamprey angiotensin II (LpAng II) that possesses a different sequence and function than teleost-type angiotensin II (Ang II) has raised a question as to the role of teleost-type angiotensin peptides in lampreys. In this study, teleost-type angiotensin like-peptides were identified in the buccal gland of lampreys by immunoassays and immunohistochemistry. The possible sources of angiotensin like-peptides were investigated in lampreys by manipulating their choice of host and food. Ang II immunoreactivity (irAng II) was detected in the buccal gland and plasma of feeding phase sea lampreys exposed to Atlantic cod, but was mostly absent in fasting lamprey. Qualitatively, the HPLC profiles of irAng II observed in the plasma, when present, were highly similar to those in buccal gland, implying that the buccal gland could be a source of plasma Ang II. Japanese lampreys force-fed with dogfish blood had significantly elevated concentrations of irAng II in their buccal glands when compared to unfed individuals, suggesting that feeding stimuli may have enhanced buccal gland activity. Teleost-type Ang II-containing proteins, other than angiotensinogen, are present in the buccal gland as trypsinization generated Ang II in vitro, and the HPLC profile of these irAng II was highly comparable to those naturally present in the buccal gland. [Asn(1), Val(5), Thr(9)]-Ang I that was identified in the buccal gland of Japanese lampreys has the same amino acid sequence to those previously isolated from the incubation of plasma and kidney extract, providing an alternative explanation for the previous isolation of teleost-type Ang I in lampreys. irAng I and irAng II were localized in the granule-like structures in the apical region of the secretory epithelia, suggesting that these peptides may be active components of lamphredin. The teleost-type angiotensin peptides in the buccal gland secretion suggested that these host-specific peptides could be part of the endocrine mimicry strategy used by lampreys to evade host immune responses and reduce immune-rejection.",Biochimie,"['D000809', 'D000818', 'D002851', 'D004703', 'D005088', 'D007118', 'D007150', 'D007798']","['Angiotensins', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Endocrine System', 'Exocrine Glands', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lampreys']",The presence of teleost-type angiotensin components in lamprey buccal gland suggests a role in endocrine mimicry.,"['Q000097', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000097']","['blood', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21963436,2012

The SELDI-TOF MS approach is advantageous due to its simplicity and high-throughput capacity, however, there are concerns regarding the reproducibility of this method. The aim of this study was to define an estrogen-responsive PES in plasma of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) using the SELDI-TOF MS technique. Protein expression analysis of male cod exposed to 17β-estradiol (E₂) showed that 27 plasma peaks were differentially expressed following exposure. The reproducibility of this result was evaluated by reanalyzing the samples six months later, and a significant change in expression was confirmed for 13 of the 27 peaks detected in the first analysis. The performance of the reproducible E₂-responsive PES, constituting these 13 peaks, was then tested on samples from juvenile cod exposed to 4-nonylphenol, North Sea oil, or North Sea oil spiked with alkylphenols. Principal component analysis revealed that nonylphenol-exposed cod could be separated from unexposed cod based on the E₂-responsive PES, indicating that the PES can be used to assess estrogenic exposure of both juvenile and adult specimens of cod. A targeted antibody-assisted SELDI-TOF MS approach was carried out in an attempt to identify the E₂-responsive peaks. Results indicated that 2 peaks were fragments of the well-known biomarkers VTG and/or ZRP.

21762652,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are still widespread environmental pollutants that bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the aquatic food chains despite the ban on their production. They constitute a class of 209 possible congeners with different chlorination pattern of the biphenyl ring structure resulting in many different toxicities and mechanisms of toxicity. The neurotoxicity of PCBs is relatively poorly understood, and biomarkers for their neurotoxic effects are lacking. We have carried out a proteomic analysis of brain tissue from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) exposed to 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153, ortho-substituted and non-coplanar), a previously demonstrated neurotoxic congener and the most prevalent congener in biological samples. The fish received 0, 0.5, 2 and 8 mg/kg PCB 153 by intraperitoneal injection, half of the dose on the first day and the second half after one week, and were exposed for two weeks in total. Using a 2-DE approach we found 56 protein spots to be 20% or more (≤ 0.8-fold or ≥ 1.2-fold) significantly different between at least one of the three PCB 153-exposed groups and the control group, and 27 of these were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and MS/MS. Approximately 80% of the differentially regulated proteins may be associated with a non stressor-specific response and/or have previously been classified as notoriously differentially regulated in 2-DE/MS based proteomics studies, such as alterations/responses in energy metabolism, cytoskeleton, protein synthesis, protein degradation (ubiquitin-proteasome system), cellular growth, cycle and death (14-3-3 protein), and (surprisingly) axon guidance (dihydropyrimidinase-like 2 (=collapsin response mediator protein 2, CRMP-2)). The six remaining affected proteins include the strongest up-regulated protein, pyridoxal kinase (essential for synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and GABA), nicotinamide phosphoribosyl-transferase (involved in protection against axonal degeneration) and protein phosphatase 1 (controls brain recovery by synaptic plasticity). The last three of these six proteins (deltex, Rab14 and sorting nexin 6) may preliminarily identify involvement of the Notch signaling pathway and endosomal function in PCB 153-induced neurotoxicity. Our findings constitute novel clues for further research on PCB 153 mode of action in brain, and a proper selection of proteins may, following validation, be applicable in a panel of biomarkers for aquatic environmental monitoring.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000818', 'D015415', 'D001921', 'D015180', 'D005260', 'D029941', 'D048389', 'D008297', 'D011078', 'D020543', 'D011897', 'D019032', 'D053719', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Brain', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Female', 'Fish Proteins', 'Gadus morhua', 'Male', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Proteome', 'Random Allocation', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Brain proteome alterations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) exposed to PCB 153.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000633', 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000633']","[None, 'metabolism', 'drug effects', None, None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, 'toxicity', 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'toxicity']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21762652,2012

An important source of free radicals taking part in this process is Fenton's reaction dependent on ferrous ions present in the tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of cod muscle proteins in sarcoplasmic and myofibril fractions to in vitro metal-catalyzed oxidation and to point out protein candidates that might play a major role in the deterioration of fish quality. Extracted control proteins and proteins subjected to free radicals generated by Fe(II)/ascorbate mixture were labeled with fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide (FTSC) to tag carbonyl groups and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Consecutive visualization of protein carbonyl levels by capturing the FTSC signal and total protein levels by capturing the SyproRuby staining signal allowed us to quantify the relative change in protein carbonyl levels corrected for changes in protein content. Proteins were identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and homology-based searches. The results show that freshly extracted cod muscle proteins exhibit a detectable carbonylation background and that the incubation with Fe(II)/ascorbate triggers a further oxidation of both sarcoplasmic and myofibril proteins. Different proteins exhibited various degrees of sensitivity to oxidation processes. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDK), triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and enolase were the sarcoplasmic proteins most vulnerable to ferrous-catalyzed oxidation. Moreover, NDK, phosphoglycerate mutase, and GAPDH were identified in several spots differing by their pI, and those forms showed different susceptibilities to metal-catalyzed oxidation, indicating that post-translational modifications may change the resistance of proteins to oxidative damage.

Fish tissue homogenates were prepared in peptone buffered water medium, according to standard method, and aliquots were dispensed into wells of a 96-well plate with the phosphorescent, oxygen-sensing probe GreenLight. Sample wells were covered with mineral oil (barrier for ambient oxygen), and the plate was monitored on a standard fluorescent reader at 30°C. The samples produced characteristic profiles, with a sharp increase in fluorescence above the baseline level at a certain threshold time, which could be correlated with initial microbial load. Five different fish species were analyzed: salmon, cod, plaice, mackerel, and whiting. Using a conventional agar plating method, the relationship between the threshold time and total aerobic viable counts load (in CFU per gram) was established, calibration curve generated, and the test was validated with 169 unknown fish samples. It showed a dynamic range of 10(4) to 10(7) CFU/g, accuracy of ± 1 log(CFU/g), assay time of 2 to 12 h (depending on the level of contamination), ruggedness with respect to the key assay parameters, simplicity (three pipetting steps, no serial dilutions), real-time data output, high sample throughput, and automation.

The products were produced in Iceland using two different processing methods (filleting and splitting) and three different salting procedures, i.e., the old single-step kench salting or a multistep procedure, and presalting (injection and brine salting or only brine salting), which was followed by kench salting. The main difference observed was between fillets and split fish, where the split fish was darker and had stronger flavor characteristics. Comparison of different salting procedures showed that the use of presalting improved the appearance of the salted products, which can be described as increased lightness and reduced yellowness of the products.

In the present study selected reproductive biomarkers were studied in prespawning Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) exposed to PW. The fish were exposed for 12 wk within a continuous flow-through system at realistic environmental near-field concentrations. Concentrations of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and alkylphenol (AP) compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection measurement, as were PAH and AP metabolites in fish bile for verification of exposure conditions and presence of compounds in PW. A suite of reproductive biomarkers (vitellogenin, zona radiata protein, and plasma steroid concentrations) and histological alterations of the gonads were determined. Results showed that exposure to sufficiently high levels of PW produced an increase in vitellogenin levels in female fish compared to the control. Impaired oocyte development and reduced estrogen levels were also observed in PW-exposed female fish. In male fish testicular development was altered, showing a rise in amount of spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes and a reduction in quantity of mature sperm in the PW-exposed fish compared to control.

Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry operating in atmospheric pressure chemical ionization conditions (LC-APCI) and by using a deuterium labelled internal standard resulted to be an effective technique to reach the analytical aim. Due to the complexity of the oily matrix, the new analytical approach required a solid phase extraction step prior to analysis. The amount of Vit.

21235209,"Due to a pH-sensitive effect in many fish hemoglobins (Hb), analytical errors may occur when mammalian Hb is used as a standard in quantitative spectrophotometric multicomponent analysis of fish blood. The aim of this work was to examine differences in the optical spectra of mammalian (human) and fish (farmed Atlantic cod) Hb subjected to pH 7.4 and 6.5. The absorption spectra of the common derivatives, deoxy- (HHb), oxy- (OHb), carboxy- (COHb), and methemoglobin (metHb), were determined in the spectral range of 450-700 nm. The metHb spectra of fish differed considerably from the corresponding human Hb spectra, whereas only minor differences in OHb, HHb, and COHb were found. Cod Hb was significantly (P < 0.05) influenced by a drop in pH compared to mammalian Hb. This resulted in deoxygenation of the Hb and increased autoxidation. For human Hb, a pH-independent isosbestic point in the spectra of OHb, HHb, and metHb at 523 nm was found. This isosbestic point was not found in the absorption spectra of cod Hb. In conclusion, spectra of cod metHb and human metHb behave differently. This must thus be taken into account in spectrophotometric multicomponent analysis.

21127932,"The collapse of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) wild populations strongly impacted the Atlantic cod fishery and led to the development of cod aquaculture. In order to improve aquaculture and broodstock quality, we need to gain knowledge of genes and pathways involved in Atlantic cod responses to pathogens and other stressors. The Atlantic Cod Genomics and Broodstock Development Project has generated over 150,000 expressed sequence tags from 42 cDNA libraries representing various tissues, developmental stages, and stimuli. We used this resource to develop an Atlantic cod oligonucleotide microarray containing 20,000 unique probes. Selection of sequences from the full range of cDNA libraries enables application of the microarray for a broad spectrum of Atlantic cod functional genomics studies. We included sequences that were highly abundant in suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries, which were enriched for transcripts responsive to pathogens or other stressors. These sequences represent genes that potentially play an important role in stress and/or immune responses, making the microarray particularly useful for studies of Atlantic cod gene expression responses to immune stimuli and other stressors. To demonstrate its value, we used the microarray to analyze the Atlantic cod spleen response to stimulation with formalin-killed, atypical Aeromonas salmonicida, resulting in a gene expression profile that indicates a strong innate immune response. These results were further validated by quantitative PCR analysis and comparison to results from previous analysis of an SSH library.

20970374,"The aggregation propensity of heat-treated codfish parvalbumin is investigated upon Maillardation of the protein under food-relevant conditions. About twelve of the fourteen lysine residues had reacted with glucose under these conditions. It is shown using circular dichroism and fluorescence that extensive coupling of glucose moieties on the protein surface does not affect the secondary and tertiary structural fold nor severely impair calcium-binding under ambient conditions. The glucosylated protein has a 3 °C higher denaturation temperature, while the free energy change involved with denaturation is reduced by 5-10%. It is shown by establishing insight in the change in heat capacity involved in the denaturation process that glucosylation of the protein is likely to result in a lower exposed hydrophobicity in the unfolded state. Aggregation kinetics, as monitored using light scattering techniques, shows that this lower exposed hydrophobicity of the denatured state slows down the aggregation process, while the shape and size of formed aggregates are comparable to those formed by non-glucosylated protein. This lower aggregation propensity allows a significantly faster digestion of heat-treated materials by pepsin.

Furthermore, there is a lack of biomarkers of MeHg neurotoxicity for use in environmental monitoring. We have undertaken a proteomic analysis of brains from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) exposed to 0, 0.5 and 2 mg/kg MeHg administered by intraperitoneal injection. The doses were given in two injections, half of the dose on the first day and the second half after 1 week, and the total exposure period lasted 2 weeks. Using 2-DE coupled with MALDI-TOF MS and MS/MS, we observed the level of 71 protein spots to be 20% or more significantly altered following MeHg exposure, and successfully identified 40 of these protein spots. Many of these proteins are associated with main known molecular targets and mechanisms of MeHg-induced neurotoxicity in mammals, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, altered calcium homeostasis and tubulin/disruption of microtubules. More interestingly, several of the affected proteins, with well-established or recently demonstrated critical functions in nervous system-specific processes, have not previously been associated with MeHg exposure in any species. These proteins include the strongest up-regulated protein, pyridoxal kinase (essential for synthesis of several neurotransmitters), G protein (coupled to neurotransmitter receptors), nicotinamide phosphoribosyl-transferase (protection against axonal degeneration), dihydropyrimidinase-like 5 (or collapsin response mediator protein 5, CRMP-5) (axon guidance and regeneration), septin (dendrite development), phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (precursor for hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide) and protein phosphatase 1 (control of brain recovery by synaptic plasticity).

Lipid-soluble arsenicals (arsenolipids) are present in a wide range of biological samples in which they could play a role in the biosynthesis of organoarsenic compounds from inorganic arsenic compounds. Arsenolipids have recently attracted considerable interest. In order to gain deeper insights into the impact of arsenolipids new analytical approaches for reliable determination of this class of arsenic-containing hydrocarbons in various matrices are needed. High concentrations of arsenolipids were found in seafood which served as sample material in this study. We report the investigation of three arsenolipids found in canned cod liver from which they were extracted and purified by solid phase extraction (SPE) using a silica gel column and ethyl acetate/methanol as eluent. Analytical studies were conducted by means of gas chromatography coupled with ICP-MS, MIP-AES and EI-qMS and by TOF-MS. The results obtained by GC-ICP-MS and GC-MIP-AES showed the existence of numerous arsenic compounds in the SPE fractions collected. Three major peaks were found within a retention time window between 10 and 25 min. The presence of arsenic compounds in the fish tissue could be confirmed using GC-EI-qMS analysis. Corresponding information of the molecular weights of the major arsenic species were provided by TOF-MS which allows highly accurate mass determinations.

Also, the 5beta-reduced forms of 17-P, 17,21-P and 17,20beta,21-P were all found. Some sulphation of 21-hydroxylated steroids was demonstrated. The ability of female G. morhua to make 17,20beta,21-P but not 17,20beta-P was confirmed by radioimmunoassay of plasma samples from spawning fish. Although small amounts of 17,20beta-P immunoreactivity were detected in a few plasma samples, this was shown, by thin-layer chromatography, to be mostly due to cross-reaction with other unidentified compounds. The evidence strongly suggests that 17,20beta,21-P is more likely than 17,20beta-P to be the maturation-inducing steroid in G. morhua.",Journal of fish biology,"['D000818', 'D003348', 'D005260', 'D048389', 'D006908', 'D010053', 'D011863']","['Animals', 'Cortisone', 'Female', 'Gadus morhua', 'Hydroxyprogesterones', 'Ovary', 'Radioimmunoassay']","Synthesis of 17,20beta,21-trihydroxypregn-4-en-3-one by ovaries of reproductively mature Atlantic cod Gadus morhua.","[None, 'Q000031', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000097', 'Q000378', None]","[None, 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'blood', 'blood', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20646137,2010

Multivariate curve resolution was employed to decompose the overall fluorescence spectra into pure fluorescent components and calculate the relative concentrations of these components in the different samples. Profiles corresponding to protoporphyrin IX, photoprotoporphyrin, and fluorescent oxidation products were identified. Sensory evaluation, TBARS, and analysis of volatiles are typical methods employed in the routine analysis and quality control of such food. Successful calibration models were established between fluorescence and those routine methods. Correlation coefficients higher than 0.80 were found for 79% and higher than 0.90 for 50% of the assessed odors and flavors. For instance, R values of 0.94, and 0.96 were obtained for fresh and rancid flavors respectively, and 0.89 for TBARS.

The sample preparation, consisting of a single step of clean-up and fractionation, took place in a column filled with different layers of neutral and sulphuric acid modified silica. The analytes were eluted by vacuum with of hexane. Significant reduction in terms of solvents, sorbents, and analysis time was achieved in comparison with literature. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was used for the separation and determination of the analytes. The instrumental limits of detection were from 0.1 to 1.3ngmL(-1) and the response of the detector was linear up to 200ngmL(-1). The separation proved to be precise (RSD<3.7% in peak area) and robust in terms of peak area, peak efficacy and resolution. The methodology was validated with two certified reference materials of cod liver oil, BCR 598 and BCR 349, obtaining no statistically significant differences between the concentrations found and certified. For the analytes that were not certified, aliquots of the reference materials were spiked and the recoveries obtained were satisfactory. These results were consistent with those found previously for DDTs by gas chromatography with an electron-capture detector. The methodology was applied to the analysis of three fish oil pills sold in Spain as a dietary supplement of vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids.

The components of VOC were identified to be toluene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, bromodichloromethane and isopropanol (IPA). The full-scale BAF was constructed of two separate reactors in series, respectively, using 10- and 15-cm diameter polypropylene balls as the packing materials and a successful preliminary bench-scale experiment was performed to feasibility. Experimental results show that the BAF removed over 90% chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the influent with (1188 +/- 605) mg/L of COD. A total organic loading of 2.76 kg biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)/(m3 packing x d) was determined for the packed bed, in which the flow pattern approached that of a mixed flow. A limited VOC concentration of (0.97 +/- 0.29) ppmv (as methane) was emitted from the BAF system. Moreover, the emission rate of VOC was calculated using the proposed formula, based on an air-water mass equilibrium relationship, and compared to the simulated results obtained using the Water 9 model.

By comparing changes in protein expression following E(2) exposure to changes induced by PW treatment, we were able to compare the induced changes by PW to the mode of action of oestrogens. Changes in the proteome in response to exposure in whole cod fry (approximately 80 days post-hatching, dph) were detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and image analysis and identified by MALDI-ToF-ToF mass spectrometry, using a newly developed cod EST database and the NCBI database. Many of the protein changes occurred at low levels (0.01% and 0.1% PW) of exposure, indicating putative biological responses at lower levels than previously detected. Using discriminant analysis, we identified a set of protein changes that may be useful as biomarker candidates of produced water (PW) and oestradiol exposure in Atlantic cod fry.

Concomitantly, another cod trypsin isozyme, trypsin X, previously only described from its cDNA sequence was detected in a separate peak from the ion exchange chromatogram. There was a stepwise increase in the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of cod trypsin I obtained with substrates containing one to three amino acid residues. As expected, the activity of trypsin I was maintained for longer periods of time at 15 degrees C than at higher temperatures. The residues of the trypsin I molecule most sensitive to autolysis were identified using Edman degradation. Eleven autolytic cleavage sites were detected within the trypsin I molecule.

All biochemical methods showed enrichment of AP in both the BBM and lipid raft fractions. Proteomic studies were performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using trypsin digested SDS-PAGE samples. Various proteins were associated with the cod intestinal lipid raft preparation such as aminopeptidase-N, prohibitin, and beta-actin. Lipid analysis with (31)P NMR and thin layer chromatography on BBMs and lipid rafts samples gave higher content of sphingomyelin than previously reported in the BBM and lower content of phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, sphingomyelin was highly dominant in the lipid rafts together with cholesterol.

19720448,"The application of hypochlorite for the removal of soluble COD, phenolic and polyphenolic like compounds, and other organic compounds responsible for the olive mill wastewater (OOWW) colour has been experimentally studied. After the OOWW filtration on a sand column, the effluent was subjected to a fast liming under optimal conditions. Lime application reduced polyphenols, COD and SS contents to half of their initial values but an important blackening of the treated OOWW was observed, especially when adding high concentrations of lime (10% (W/V) and 15% (W/V)). A second stage of treatment was applied using calcium hypochlorite. In this stage, removal of the studied compounds reached as much as 95% at higher concentrations, and particularly the colouring of OOWW which is generally difficult to eliminate was greatly reduced. The OOWW hypochloration acted through coagulation-flocculation and a rapid oxidation of the organic matter proceeded from the first 5min. The kinetic study of the degradation of the waste polluting compounds from liming showed that Ca(ClO)(2) reacts similarly in the elimination of organic compounds, polyphenols, SS and colouration.

While cis-configurated isomers belong to the classic fatty acids of food, trans-fatty acids are suspected to pose a risk to human health. In either case, a thorough assessment of both positional and geometrical isomers of MUFAs is an important task in food and life sciences. For this purpose, a method suitable for routine analysis was developed. After lipid extraction and conversion of fatty acids into corresponding fatty acid methyl esters, cis and trans isomers of MUFAs were separated on silver-ion-impregnated cartridges. Fractions containing either cis- or trans-MUFAs were determined by gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring (GC/EI-MS-SIM) mode using [M-32](+) as quantification ions and [M-74](+) as well as M(+) as qualifier ions. A total of 14 MUFAs were available as reference standards, but a total of 40 MUFAs (22 cis and 18 trans isomers) were identified with high selectivity in samples of cheese, goat fat, human milk, and cod liver oil. The 18:1 and 16:1 isomers contributed most to both the cis- and trans-MUFAs. Application of internal standards allowed for the quantification of MUFAs only in the food samples. The amount of trans-fatty acids was determined to be 0.9- 4.3 g/100 g, with the lowest levels in human milk fat and the highest levels in Roquefort cheese.

The concentration of bile metabolites from fish exposed through water rose with increasing lipophilicity, but this relationship was less clear for fish exposed through diet.

Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and SPMD were exposed over a 4-wk period to a mixture that was designed to simulate the composition of PAH in produced water discharges in the North Sea. Fish bile and whole SPMD were analyzed after exposure in a high, low, and a control treatment tank.

Exposure water concentrations, calculated from SPMD accumulations, showed some considerable differences from nominal concentrations for volatile compounds. Concentration factors (CF) for fish based on SPMD-derived water concentrations ranged from 2.9 to 354.3 L/g. CF increased with hydrophobicity with more variation at higher log K(ow). Regression analysis of accumulations of individual compounds in fish and SPMDs showed reasonable but compound-specific correlation, r2 = .54-.85 (C1-phenanthrenes/anthracenes and pyrene, respectively). Comparison of the two exposures suggests that fish CF may not be entirely independent of water concentrations.

In this study, dioxin results obtained using the Dioxin Responsive Chemical-Activated LUciferase gene eXpression (DR-CALUX((R))) cell-based assay (quantitative approach), were compared with gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) analyses data. Instead of using World Health Organization-toxic equivalent factor (WHO-TEF), the comparison was based on the assessment of relative effective potencies (REPs) for each congener of the 17 toxic 2,3,7,8-polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) and 12 dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs). According to published data, DR-CALUX((R))-REP evaluated here appear similar to WHO-TEF for PCDD/Fs while lower values were observed for DL-PCBs. We analyzed two ""home made"" contaminated fat samples, displaying both the same WHO-toxic equivalent quantities (WHO-TEQ) concentration (12pgWHO-TEQg(-1)).

In both cases, the DR-CALUX((R)) measured concentration (picogram 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) eq.g(-1)) corresponded to the PCDD/Fs WHO-TEQ concentration only. A good agreement was nevertheless found between the DR-CALUX((R)) measurements and the recalculated DR-CALUX((R))-TEQ contents (using DR-CALUX((R))-REP instead of WHO-TEF), demonstrating that the observed response was due, in both cases, to the addition of the responses of the standards added to the fat. By contrast, in real contaminated samples (feed or cod liver samples), DR-CALUX((R)) measured concentrations were similar to WHO-TEQ GC-HRMS measured concentrations. But, depending on the PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs congener content, the DR-CALUX((R)) measured concentrations were either lower or higher than calculated DR-CALUX((R))-TEQ contents, demonstrating that possible co-extracted contaminants contributed to the CALUX response.

18763042,"Shark skeletal muscle tropomyosin is classified as an alpha-type isoform. The chemical structure is characterised by the absence of cysteine and the presence of a sub-stoichiometric amount of covalently bound phosphate. The protein migrates as a single component on a SDS polyacrylamide gel but is resolved into two components by chromatography and electrophoresis both in the presence of urea at mild alkaline pH. The only detectable difference between these components is the presence of phosphoserine in the tropomyosin form of greater net negative charge. Low ionic strength (pH 7) solutions of phosphorylated shark tropomyosin display significantly higher specific viscosity than unphosphorylated, consistent with the presence of a phosphorylation site within the overlap region, serine 283, as well as conservation of the positively charged amino terminal region. Similar observations were made with tropomyosin prepared from the trunk muscle of Atlantic cod. In a steady-state MgATPase assay, thin filaments (Ca2+) reconstituted with shark phosphorylated tropomyosin activate myosin to a greater extent than those composed of unphosphorylated. The difference is attributable chiefly to a change in Vmax.

Comparison of instrumental performance between DSI-GC x GC/TOF-MS and the traditional gas chromatographic high resolution mass spectrometric (GC-HRMS) method showed good agreement of results for standard solutions analyzed in blind fashion. Relatively high tolerance of the DSI technique for lipids in the final extracts enabled a streamlined sample preparation procedure that only required gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) cleanup with graphitized carbon black. The sample size for the method was 2g of cod liver oil, which achieved limits of quantitation (LOQs) of 0.019-7.8 pg/g toxic equivalent quotients for the individual PCDD/Fs. Lower detection limits can be achieved by using larger sample size and scaling up the sample preparation procedure, but this adds to the labor, time, solvent consumption, and expense of the approach. However, the streamlined method yielded 0.94 pg/g and 2.3 pg/g LOQs for 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzofuran (TCDF) and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachloro biphenyl (CB126), which were sufficiently low for regulatory monitoring of 2g samples. Therefore, instead of congener specific analysis, this streamlined analytical screening method for TCDF and CB126 has the potential to monitor fish oil contaminated with dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs at or above current food safety limits.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of these cellular responses remain poorly understood. We performed a gel-based differential proteomics study to examine cellular responses (as determined by altered protein expression) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, which were derived from dog kidney and exhibited distal renal tubule phenotype, during calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) crystal adhesion. MDCK cells were grown in a medium without or with COD crystals (100 microg/ml) for 48 h. Crystal adhesion was illustrated by phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy. Flow cytometry using annexin V/propidium iodide double staining showed that the percentage of cell death did not significantly differ between cells with and without COD crystal adhesion. Cellular proteins were then extracted, resolved with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), and visualized by SYPRO Ruby staining ( n = 5 gels per group). Quantitative intensity analysis revealed 11 significantly altered proteins, 10 of which were successfully identified by quadrupole time-of-flight peptide mass fingerprinting (MS) and/or tandem MS (MS/MS), including metabolic enzymes, cellular structural protein, calcium-binding protein, adhesion molecule, protein involved in RNA metabolism, and chaperone.

The cod muscle was powdered by freeze-pulverization and was placed into 600 glass bottles (10 g each), which were sterilized with gamma-ray irradiation. The certification was carried out using species-specific isotope dilution gas chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SSID-GC-ICPMS), where (202)Hg-enriched methylmercury (MeHg) was used as the spike compound. In order to avoid any possible analytical biases caused by nonquantitative extraction, degradation and/or formation of MeHg in sample preparations, two different extraction methods (KOH/methanol and HCl/methanol extractions) were performed, and one of these extraction methods utilized two different derivatization methods (ethylation and phenylation). A double ID method was adopted to minimize the uncertainty arising from the analyses. In order to ensure not only the reliability of the analytical results but also traceability to SI units, the standard solution of MeHg used for the reverse-ID was prepared from high-purity MeHg chloride and was carefully assayed as follows: the total mercury was determined by ID-ICPMS following aqua regia digestion, and the ratio of Hg as MeHg to the total Hg content was estimated by GC-ICPMS.

Although there are few natural dietary sources, dietary intake may help maintain vitamin D status. We investigated the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), bone health, overweight, sunlight exposure and dietary vitamin D in 3113 women (age 54.8 [SD 2.3] years) living at latitude 57 degrees N between 1998-2000. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), dietary intakes (food frequency questionnaire, n=2598), sunlight exposure (questionnaire, n=2402) and bone markers were assessed. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry in all women at the sampling visit and 6 years before. Seasonal variation in 25(OH)D was not substantial with a peak in the autumn (23.7 [9.9] ng/ml) and a nadir in spring (19.7 [7.6] ng/ml). Daily intake of vitamin D was 4.2 [2.5] mug from food only and 5.8 [4.0] mug including vitamin D from cod liver oil and multivitamins. The latter was associated with 25(OH)D at each season whereas vitamin D simply from food was associated with 25(OH)D in winter and spring only. Sunlight exposure was associated with 25(OH)D in summer and autumn. 25(OH)D was negatively associated with increased bone resorption and bone loss (P<0.05) remaining significant after adjustment for confounders (age, weight, height, menopausal status/HRT use, physical activity and socio-economic status). Using an insufficiency cut-off of <28 ng/ml 25(OH)D, showed lower concentrations of bone resorption markers in the upper category (fDPD/Cr 5.1 [1.7] nmol/mmol compared to 5.3 [2.1] nmol/mmol, P=0.03) and no difference in BMD or bone loss. 25(OH)D was lower (P<0.01) and parathyroid hormone higher (P<0.01) in the top quintile of body mass index.

The degree of alkylation ranged from methyl (C1) to heptyl (C7) and represents the types of APs present in produced water. Fish bile was collected on day 4 and 16 (exposure groups 2-MP, 3,5-DMP, 2,4,6-TMP and 4-t-B-2-MP) following exposure. Characterization of major metabolites was accomplished by enzymatic de-conjugation and analysis by high performance liquid chromatography connected to a fluorescence detector (HPLC-F) acquiring at ex/em 222/306 nm. Two solid phase extraction (SPE) columns were evaluated for clean-up of samples prior to analysis. Independent of alkyl homologue, the glucuronide conjugated APs were the most abundant metabolites (73-100%), whereas sulfates, glucosides and unchanged compounds were excreted in amounts of 0-21%, 0-6.1% and 0-6.3%, respectively. The total concentration of measured metabolites in the bile, determined as their respective APs after de-conjugation, increased with increasing degree of alkylation (3.2+/-2.6 microg/g bile for 2-MP and 571+/-81 microg/g bile for 4-n-HepP) after exposure to an equal dose of AP. Comparison of metabolite concentrations in bile sampled 4 and 16 days after exposure, showed that the levels of 2-MP, 2,4,6-TMP and 4-t-B-2-MP were reduced by 55%, 30% and 45%, respectively whereas 3,5-DMP increased by 25% (not significant).

17920655,"Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) have been introduced as flame retardants in 1970. Despite decreasing application rates since the mid-1970s, PBB residues are still reported in the environment. Furthermore, environmental PBB residues often do not match the PBB pattern in technical products. To get insights into the structures of environmentally-relevant PBBs, the congener patterns of technical hexabromobiphenyl (THBB), octabromobiphenyl (TOBB), synthesized PBB 209 were compared to PBB residues in a cod liver sample from the Baltic Sea. The most relevant PBB congeners in Baltic cod liver were not present in the technical products and therefore most likely metabolites. For this reason, TOBB and HPLC-fractions obtained from this technical product were incubated with super-reduced cyanocobalamine. Reductive debromination was found to be the predominant transformation process. Bromine substituents in ortho-positions proved to be more recalcitrant, and several of the unknown PBBs were tri- and tetra-ortho substituted congeners. Furthermore, the key-PBBs determined in Baltic cod liver were formed during this process. The most important hexabromobiphenyl in Baltic cod liver was identified as PBB 155 by parallel synthesis. PBB 155 which was not detected in the technical PBB product analyzed was suggested as an indicator PBB congener suited to decide whether PBB residues originate from the previous use of THBB (low relative abundance of PBB 155) or TOBB/TDBB (high relative abundance of PBB 155). The latter scenario was found to be valid for the Baltic cod liver sample.

17889928,"Fish and fishery products are considered as the main source of organotin compounds (OTC). Unfortunately, little national contamination data is available to assess food exposure of organotins from French consumers. To provide a more accurate estimate of risks to human health, the butyltin, phenyltin and octyltin compounds sampling in four French coastal areas were measured in 159 composite samples (96 fresh and frozen fish, 28 mollusks, 14 crustaceans, 1 echinoderm, 11 canned foods, 4 smoked fish, 5 prepared seafood-based dishes) by capillary gas chromatography coupled with a microwave induced plasma atomic-emission spectrometer (CGC-MIP-AES). In these samples, butyltins were usually predominant and the range of the contamination levels was generally below those of earlier studies (fish: mean 5.6; min-max 1.1-23 microg/kg; fishery products: mean 6; min-max 0.8-14 microg/kg). Fish, especially tuna, salmon, mackerel, saithe/coalfish and cod were largely the main contributors (38%) to the total organotin exposure.

However, the utmost OTC exposure was lesser than 47% of the provisional tolerable weekly intake [EFSA (European Food Safety Agency).

Cages containing hatchery-reared Atlantic cod Gadus morhua were deployed on expected contamination gradients, along a transect from the River Elbe in the German Bight, and in the vicinity of an oil field in the North Sea (Statfjord). Six weeks later, the cod were retrieved and samples taken for a range of biological effects techniques. In this study, metallothionein (MT) and total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) were measured in liver samples from the caged cod, together with metals (as a measure of bioaccumulation). Both MT and TOSC were highest in cod from the German Bight. In the Statfjord samples MT and TOSC decreased with distance from the oil platform indicating induction in response to anthropogenic sources. The bioavailability of metals appears to be a major factor in MT synthesis, and the measurement of MT and associated metals is shown to be a useful tool for biological exposure and effects monitoring in pelagic systems. There also appears to be a strong linkage between MT and TOSC levels, indicating overlapping capabilities as stress biomarkers.

17599546,"Methylmercury is known to bioaccumulate and biomagnify up the marine food chain. Fish from high levels of the marine food chain may contain relatively high concentrations of mercury, and most (>70%) of the mercury found in muscle is methylmercury. In aquaculture, marine protein (mainly fishmeal) is the dominant source of methylmercury, and this raises some concern with regards to fish welfare and consumer safety. A dietary exposure study, including a depuration period, was carried out in order to study the accumulation and elimination of methylmercury in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), and to estimate the transfer of methylmercury from feed to fish. Fish were sampled throughout a three month exposure period and a three month depuration period. Muscle samples were fractionated into a protein and a lipid fraction by lipid extraction using methanol and chloroform. Mercury and methylmercury were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and gas chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC-ICPMS), respectively. A continuous accumulation of methylmercury, after a lag period of 10 days, was observed in muscle tissue during the three months exposure to methylmercury (0.95+/-0.03 microg Hg/g feed, n=6). After three months, the final concentration in muscle was 0.38+/-0.04 microg Hg/g w w (n=6), where methylmercury constituted 90-95% of the mercury present. The elimination of methylmercury from muscle was slow and incomplete (within the three months of depuration) with an estimated elimination half-life (t1/2) of 377 days. The transfer of methylmercury from feed to Atlantic cod, described by the estimated absorption efficiency, was 38%. In muscle more than 99% of the mercury was found in the protein fraction. These results suggest that Atlantic cod readily takes up dietary methylmercury, which is efficiently accumulated into muscle, where it is incorporated into larger peptides or proteins. Comparable results were found for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). After three months of exposure to dietary methylmercury the final concentration in muscle was 0.33+/-0.01 microg Hg/g w w (n=3), where nearly all (>99%) mercury was found in the protein fraction. This further supports that methylmercury is accumulated in fish muscle, where it is incorporated into larger peptides or proteins.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000818', 'D004032', 'D004781', 'D048389', 'D008055', 'D008767', 'D009132', 'D011506', 'D011897', 'D020317', 'D013997']","['Animals', 'Diet', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Gadus morhua', 'Lipids', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Muscles', 'Proteins', 'Random Allocation', 'Salmo salar', 'Time Factors']",Accumulation and elimination of methylmercury in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) following dietary exposure.,"[None, 'Q000662', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000008', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, 'veterinary', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17599546,2007

Using this system, food samples (butter, goat's milk fat, suet, human milk, seal oil, cod liver oil) known to contain aFAs were analyzed. Prior to the enantioselective gas chromatography, unsaturated fatty acids were preseparated by urea complexation, silver ion high performance liquid chromatography (Ag+-HPLC), or both from food samples. The fractions of the food samples enriched with methyl-branched fatty acids were then analyzed by GC/MS in the SIM mode.

17075605,"Chronic cocaine use in humans and animal models is known to lead to pronounced alterations in neuronal function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region associated with drug reinforcement. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to compare protein alterations in the NAc between cocaine overdose (COD) victims (n=10) and controls (n=10). Following image normalization, spots with significantly differential image intensities (P<0.05) were identified, excised, trypsin digested and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-time of flight. A total of 1407 spots were found to be present in a minimum of five subjects per group and the intensity of 18 spots was found to be differentially abundant between the groups, leading to positive identification of 15 proteins by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). Of an additional 37 protein spots that were constitutively expressed, 32 proteins were positively identified by PMF. Increased proteins in COD included beta-tubulin, liprin-alpha3 and neuronal enolase, whereas decreased proteins included parvalbumin, ATP synthase beta-chain and peroxiredoxin 2. The present data provide a preliminary protein profile of COD, suggesting the involvement of novel proteins and pathways in the expression of this complex disease.

Samples from cattle, pigs, goats, deer, horses, chickens, ducks, ostriches, salmon, cod, shrimp, crabs, scallops, bullfrogs and alligators each exhibited unique electrochemical profiles. Species-specific markers exhibited reproducible peak retention times with coefficients of variation less then 6% across different runs, body regions and subjects. The method requires no derivatization or extraction steps and may be applicable to fresh or cooked meats. Incubation of fresh beef, pork or chicken at room temperature for 24h or repeated freezing and thawing changed the intensity but not the pattern of species-specific peaks. In conclusion, this method appears suitable for rapid differentiation of meats from various food animal species and demonstrates the utility of electrochemical detection to supplement existing immunochemical and molecular biological methods.

16637674,"Ethyl esters (FAEE) and trideuterium-labeled methyl esters (d3-FAME) of fatty acids were prepared and investigated regarding their suitability as internal standards (IS) for the determination of fatty acids as methyl esters (FAME). On CP-Sil 88, ethyl esters of odd-numbered fatty acids eluted approximately 0.5 min after the respective FAME, and only coelutions with minor FAME were observed. Depending on the problem, one or even many FAEE can be added as IS for the quantification of FAME by both GC-FID and GC-MS. By contrast, d3-FAME coeluted with FAME on the polar GC column, and the use of the former as IS requires application of GC-MS. In the SIM mode, m/z 77 and 90 are suggested for d3-methyl esters of saturated fatty acids, whereas m/z 88 and 101 are recommended for ethyl esters of saturated fatty acids. These m/z values give either no or very low response for FAME and can thus be used for the analysis of FAME in food by GC-MS in the SIM mode. Fatty acids in sunflower oil and mozzarella cheese were quantified using five saturated FAEE as IS. Gravimetric studies showed that the transesterification procedure could be carried out without of loss of fatty acids. GC-EI/MS full scan analysis was suitable for the quantitative determination of all unsaturated fatty acids in both food samples, whereas GC-EI/MS in the SIM mode was particularly valuable for quantifying minor fatty acids. The novel GC-EI/MS/SIM method using fatty acid ethyl esters as internal standards can be used to quantify individual fatty acids only, that is, without determination of all fatty acids (the common 100% method), although this is present.

ProteinChip) array technology in combination with surfaced enhanced laser desorption ionisation-time of flight (SELDI-TOF) was used to investigate general responses in plasma proteins. In addition, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to analyse two specific biomarkers of estrogenic exposure, vitellogenin (Vtg) and zona radiata protein (Zrp) in plasma. Both methods revealed clear species specific responses. In cod, 67% of significantly altered proteins showed the same response (up or down regulated) in NP and BPA exposed animals (males and females combined). The rest were either specific to NP (10%), BPA (19%) or they showed opposite responses to the two chemicals (4%). In contrast, only 20% of significantly altered proteins were common for NP and BPA exposed turbot: 60% were altered only in NP and 17% only in BPA. Furthermore, in BPA exposed cod, 77% of the responses were common for male and females, whereas turbot showed only 21% similarity for the two genders. However, NP exposed male and female turbot showed 88% similarity in responses. As gender was not determined in NP exposed cod, gender specific responses could not be determined. ELISA results supported that cod responded clearly to both chemicals as a large increase was observed in Vtg and Zrp levels. Turbot responded strongly to NP, but seemed only slightly affected by BPA. Overall, the results indicated that cod are more sensitive or respond with less specificity to estrogenic chemicals than turbot. The relatively large degree of common responses in NP and BPA exposed cod may indicate that in cod BPA have similar mode of action as NP. Generally, the results show the potential of SELDI-TOF as a tool for comparing multiple responses, and for identifying exposure as well as gender specific responses.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000818', 'D001559', 'D015536', 'D004527', 'D004797', 'D005260', 'D005412', 'D048389', 'D015870', 'D020869', 'D008297', 'D010636', 'D012737', 'D019032', 'D015854', 'D014819']","['Animals', 'Benzhydryl Compounds', 'Down-Regulation', 'Egg Proteins', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flatfishes', 'Gadus morhua', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Male', 'Phenols', 'Sex Factors', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vitellogenins']",Comparison of protein expression in plasma from nonylphenol and bisphenol A-exposed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) by use of SELDI-TOF.,"[None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000096', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000187', 'Q000096']","[None, None, 'drug effects', 'biosynthesis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'methods', None, 'blood', None, 'methods', 'drug effects', 'biosynthesis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16621060,2007

Volunteer A consumed 85 g (wet mass) of cod liver containing a total of approximately 120 microg arsenic, 77% of which was present as arsenolipids, and volunteer B consumed 85 g (wet mass) of cod liver, 25% of which was present as arsenolipids, together with 20 g of cod liver oil, containing a total of about 180 microg arsenic. The structures of the arsenolipids are currently unknown, whereas the majority of the non-lipid arsenic in the cod liver was identified as arsenobetaine, which was excreted unchanged.

In vivo 35S-sulfate labeling combined with ultracentrifugation in CsCl2, DEAE chromatography and scintillation counting of the eluates, revealed that the content of 35S-labeled PGs was much higher in wolffish than in cod. A considerable proportion of the 35S-sulfated PGs in both species was HSPG, as judged by nitrous acid degradation. HSPG represented, however, a higher proportion of the 35S-sulfated PGs in cod compared to wolffish. Dot blot and electrophoresis/western blot using two different HS-mAbs, 10E4 and HepSS-1 indicated structural differences in the HS-chains of the PGs present. This observation was strengthened by immunohistochemistry, showing that both mAbs detected epitopes in the pericellular area, but the staining patterns were not superimposable.

Proteins were extracted according to 11 different storage conditions and samples were resolved by 2-DE. Data generated by 2-DE was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant partial least squares regression (DPLSR). Applying PCA to 2-DE data revealed the samples to form groups according to frozen storage time, whereas differences due to different storage temperatures or chilled storage in modified atmosphere packing did not lead to distinct changes in protein pattern. Applying DPLSR to the 2-DE data enabled the selection of protein spots critical for differentiation between 3 and 6 months frozen storage with 12 months frozen storage.

A Root effect (low oxygen affinity at pH 6.3) was determined in trout hemoglobin but not myoglobin. At pH 6.3, myoglobin autoxidized more rapidly (3.5-fold) as compared to anodic hemoglobin. Anodic hemoglobin was a better catalyst of lipid oxidation in washed cod muscle as compared to myoglobin at pH 6.3. This suggested that some process other than met heme protein formation was the rate-limiting step in lipid oxidation processes. Heme loss rates were determined using the apomyoglobin mutant H64Y prepared from sperm whale. Anodic hemoglobin released its heme group much more rapidly than myoglobin. In comparisons of anodic and cathodic hemoglobins, heme loss rate better predicted the onset of lipid oxidation than autoxidation rate.

Three parameters: reaction time, temperature and presence of non-polar solvent, were studied by an experimental 2(3) full factorial design. The method was validated for five different types of samples; cod liver (high lipid content >60%, mainly triacylglycerol), cod muscle (low lipid content, approximately 1%, mainly phospholipids), cod plasma (lipid content, approximately 2%, mainly lipoprotein complex, high water amount), cod testis (lipid content approximately 3%, high levels of cholesterol), and herring muscle (lipid content approximately 7%). The one-step procedure for extraction/methylation of wet tissues was compared with the traditional procedure of extraction of the lipids by the Folch method (chloroform/methanol, 2:1, v/v), followed by methylation. The two methods gave similar FA profiles. The one-step extraction/methylation procedure gave a higher recovery of the total FA than the traditional procedure. Problems with carry-over peaks of cholesterol from previous samples were avoided by application of extra long GC temperature programs. The cholesterol decomposed to some degree under the preceding methanolysis step, giving several peaks in the chromatograms. The decomposition peaks were identified by mass spectrometry as cholestdienes originating from dehydration of cholesterol, a metylether of cholesterol and a cholesteryl chloride. These cholesterol artefacts can be used for quantitative determination of cholesterol in the samples.

VTG induction was found in male cod caught in the North Sea, the Shetland Box area, in Oslofjord and also in cultivated fish. There was a strong relationship between concentrations of VTG and fish size. There was no evidence that the presence of VTG in the plasma of males is a natural part of their life cycle. On the other hand, the size of fish at which these elevated VTG concentrations appear (ca. 5 kg) is about the size that cod change from feeding primarily on benthic invertebrates to mainly other fish, both benthic and pelagic.

Organisms from Terra Nova Bay also are exposed to a natural enrichment of cadmium, but to our knowledge, whether such environmental conditions influence biological responses to anthropogenic pollutants has never been considered. In the present study, the Antarctic rock cod (Trematomus bernacchii) was exposed to model chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo[a]pyrene), persistent organic pollutants (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [TCDD]), cadmium, and a combination of cadmium and TCDD. Analyzed parameters included chemical bioaccumulation, activity, and levels of biotransformation enzymes (cytochrome P4501A); metallothioneins and the efficiency of the antioxidant system measured as individual defenses (catalase, glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferases, and glutathione peroxidases); and total scavenging capacity toward peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals. Reciprocal interactions between metabolism of inorganic and organic pollutants were demonstrated. Dioxin enhanced the accumulation of cadmium, probably stored within proliferating endoplasmic reticulum, and cadmium suppressed the inducibility of cytochrome P4501A, allowing us to hypothesize a posttranscriptional mechanism as the depletion of heme group availability. Clear evidence of oxidative perturbation was provided by the inhibition of antioxidants and enhanced sensitivity to oxyradical toxicity in fish exposed to organic chemicals. Exposure to cadmium revealed counteracting responses of glutathione metabolism; however, these responses did not prevent a certain loss of antioxidant capacity toward peroxyl radicals. The pattern of antioxidant responses exhibited by fish coexposed to cadmium and TCDD was more similar to that observed for cadmium than to that observed for TCDD. The overall results suggest that elevated natural levels of cadmium in Antarctic organisms from Terra Nova Bay can limit biotransformation capability of polycyclic (halogenated) hydrocarbons, thus influencing the bioaccumulation and biological effects of these chemicals in key sentinel species.",Environmental toxicology and chemistry,"['D000818', 'D000864', 'D000975', 'D001564', 'D002104', 'D002105', 'D003577', 'D004347', 'D004784', 'D005399', 'D005978', 'D008668', 'D018384', 'D000072317', 'D018336', 'D013054']","['Animals', 'Antarctic Regions', 'Antioxidants', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Cadmium', 'Cadmium Poisoning', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Drug Interactions', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Fishes', 'Glutathione', 'Metallothionein', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",Interactions between metabolism of trace metals and xenobiotic agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the antarctic fish Trematomus bernacchii: environmental perspectives.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000493', 'Q000493', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000493', 'Q000819', None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'pharmacokinetics', 'pharmacokinetics', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'methods', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'pharmacokinetics', 'agonists', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16117125,2005

The efficiencies were similar regardless of the pH, which indicates that direct reactions of ozone with wastewater organics were predominant to radical reactions. Gel permeation chromatography confirmed the reduction in the concentration of organics absorbing light at 475 nm after ozonation. The elimination of bicarbonate ion, strong inhibitor of hydroxyl radical reactions, yielded an improvement in both color and COD reduction efficiencies. Acidification for removing bicarbonate ions produced a shift of colored compounds to smaller molecular weights. The highest efficiencies were achieved at 40 degrees C. Color and COD reductions at 40 degrees C were about 90% and 37%, respectively. In no case, the percentage of TOC removed was higher than 10-15%. Stirring rate had a slightly positive effect during the first stage of the ozonation showing that mass transfer played a role only during the initial reaction phase when direct attack of ozone molecules to aromatic/olefinic structures of colored substances was the predominant pathway.",Chemosphere,"['D001639', 'D002244', 'D003116', 'D005285', 'D019649', 'D006863', 'D007220', 'D008965', 'D010083', 'D010100', 'D010126', 'D011108', 'D013696', 'D014865']","['Bicarbonates', 'Carbon', 'Color', 'Fermentation', 'Food Industry', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Industrial Waste', 'Molasses', 'Oxidants, Photochemical', 'Oxygen', 'Ozone', 'Polymers', 'Temperature', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid']",Variables affecting efficiency of molasses fermentation wastewater ozonation.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16054910,2005
16047766,"Statistical analysis of organochlorine contaminants (OCs) in marine mammals has shown that, for most OCs, the European Arctic is more contaminated than the Canadian and U.S. Arctic. Recently, comparison of OC concentration ranges in seabirds, arctic cod (Boregadus saida), and zooplankton, found no difference between these regions. To address these inconsistencies, marine food web OC data from the European (central Barents Sea (CBS)) and Canadian Arctic (Northwater Polynya (NOW)) were simultaneously statistically analyzed. In general, concentrations of OCs were greater in seabirds and ringed seals (Phoca hispida) from the CBS as compared to the NOW; consistent with circumpolar trends observed in marine mammals. In contrast, levels of OCs were generally similar in zooplankton and arctic cod between the CBS and NOW. The main exception is HCH which had greater levels in the NOW across all trophic levels because of the greater proximity to sources in eastern Asia. The lack of differences in OC concentrations in zooplankton and Arctic cod from the European and Canadian Arctic suggest that regional differences in OC contamination in the Arctic have evened out. Reduced regional differences were not observed in marine mammals or seabirds because they are long-lived and also acquire contaminants from maternal transfer and hence reflect levels from the past when the European Arctic was more contaminated than the Canadian Arctic. In addition, seabirds may reflect exposure from other areas. This study highlights the potential problem of comparing spatial trends by using means and confidence intervals as compared to simultaneous statistical analysis of raw data. Differences in the spatial trends of OCs between trophic levels in the Arctic are important for consideration when assessing regional differences in spatial and temporal trends of discontinued and current-use contaminants.",Environmental science & technology,"['D000704', 'D000818', 'D001110', 'D017753', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D020387', 'D008401', 'D006843', 'D008055', 'D009587', 'D014714', 'D015048']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Arctic Regions', 'Ecosystem', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Food Chain', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated', 'Lipids', 'Nitrogen Isotopes', 'Vertebrates', 'Zooplankton']",Why do organochlorine differences between arctic regions vary among trophic levels?,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16047766,2006

Samples were sequentially hydrolyzed with pepsin (30 min) and pancreatin (2, 4, or 6 h) in a dialysis cell with continuous removal of digestion products. Nondialyzed digests were fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography and ultrafiltration. Animal proteins were digested at a greater rate than plant proteins. Target amino acids of specific enzymes appeared more rapidly in the dialyzed fractions when compared to other amino acids. Throughout the hydrolysis, nondialyzed digests contained a higher proportion of peptide mixtures with basic-neutral properties. Except for gluten, peptide fractions with molecular weights that exceeded 10 kDa (basic-neutral, BN > 10) were rapidly hydrolyzed during the first 2 h of pancreatin digestion. The kinetics of release and the composition of peptide fractions were different when the protein sources were compared. The analysis of amino acids revealed that threonine and proline proportions were relatively high in BN > 10 and in peptide fractions with molecular weight between 10-1 kDa (BN 10-1), while tyrosine, phenylalanine, lysine, and arginine predominated in the low molecular weight (<1 kDa) fractions.

The study of these compounds has been hindered, however, by the lack of a suitable analytical technique able to separate and measure the various lipid species. As a source of arsenolipids, we used 10 crude fish oils from various regions of the world. Total arsenic analyses on the fish oils, performed with ICPMS following acid digestion with microwave-assisted heating, gave concentrations from 4.3 to 10.5 mg As kg(-1). All of the arsenic was soluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane. Analysis of the fish oils for arsenolipids was performed by normal phase HPLC-ICPMS with various mixtures of organic solvents as mobile phases. Inherent problems of instability associated with the introduction of organic solvents to the plasma were overcome by the use of reduced column flow, a chilled spray chamber, and the addition of oxygen directly to the plasma. All ten fish oils appeared to contain the same 4-6 major arsenolipids, but in varying amounts depending on the origin of the fish. Further chromatography with both normal phase and reversed-phase conditions on some of the oils indicated the presence of many more minor arsenolipids. Quantification was achieved by external calibration against triphenylarsine oxide or triphenylarsine sulfide, and the sum of species following HPLC of the oils matched well the total arsenic results (92-107%). The method was applied to samples of food supplements (fish oil capsules) and a packaged food product (cod liver) whereby arsenolipids were measured and found to be significant arsenic constituents.

We extracted a molecule that induced a bacterial AHL monitor (Agrobacterium tumefaciens NT1 [pZLR4]) from packed cod fillets, which spoil due to growth of Photobacterium phosphoreum. Interestingly, AHLs were produced by 13 nonbioluminescent strains of P. phosphoreum isolated from the product. Of 177 strains of P. phosphoreum (including 18 isolates from this study), none of 74 bioluminescent strains elicited a reaction in the AHL monitor, whereas 48 of 103 nonbioluminescent strains did produce AHLs. AHLs were also detected in Aeromonas spp., but not in Shewanella strains. Thin-layer chromatographic profiles of cod extracts and P. phosphoreum culture supernatants identified a molecule similar in relative mobility (Rf value) and shape to N-(3-hydroxyoctanoyl)homoserine lactone, and the presence of this molecule in culture supernatants from a nonbioluminescent strain of P. phosphoreum was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography-positive electrospray high-resolution mass spectrometry. Bioluminescence (in a non-AHL-producing strain of P. phosphoreum) was strongly up-regulated during growth, whereas AHL production in a nonbioluminescent strain of P. phosphoreum appeared constitutive. AHLs apparently did not influence bioluminescence, as the addition of neither synthetic AHLs nor supernatants delayed or reduced this phenotype in luminescent strains of P. phosphoreum.

This study looked at the potential of lipid biomarkers as an indicator for the dispersal of organic waste from a fish enclosure. The lipid class and fatty acid composition of settling particles collected by sediment traps on a transect away from a cod enclosure was determined. The proportions of free fatty acids and of three long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids close to the fish pens were significantly higher (p<0.05) than before the fish enclosure was in operation and decreased moving away from the pens. This indicated a higher contribution of feces and/or uneaten feed to the settling particles at this location. Free fatty acids are the major lipid class in feces.

15183756,"Analyses of temperature-dependent kinetic parameters in enzymes extracted from tissues of ectothermic animals are usually carried out within the range of physiological temperatures (0-40 degrees C). However, multisample spectrophotometers (so-called microplate readers) with efficient wide-range temperature control (including cooling) have previously been unavailable. This limits the statistical quality of the measurements. A temperature-controlled microplate was designed for a 96-well microplate reader to overcome this limitation. This so-called T-microplate is able to control assay temperature between the freezing point of a liquid sample and 60 degrees C with high stability and accuracy in any data acquisition mode. At 4 degrees C the accuracy of the temperature control was +/-0.1 degrees C and temperature homogeneity across the microplate was +/-0.3 degrees C. As examples, analyses of the temperature dependence of Michaelis-Menten (K'(PYR)(m) and substrate inhibition (K'(PYR)(si) constants for pyruvate, of the maximal rate of reaction (V'(max), of the apparent Arrhenius activation energy (E(A), and of the Gibbs free-energy change (deltaG) of lactate dehydrogenases from muscle of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua acclimated to 4 degrees C are described.

15152665,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of toxic, persistent, bioaccumulating organic compounds containing two or more fused aromatic rings. They are listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as priority pollutants because of their carcinogenicity and toxicity. Employing ozonation as a remediation technique, this work investigated the treatability of a sediment sample from a freshwater boat slip subjected to coal tar contamination over a long period. The contaminated sediment sample contained high levels of PAHs in the forms of naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene, among other byproducts present in the humic and solid phases of the sediment. The objectives of this work were to examine (1) the degradation of PAHs in the contaminated sediment as treated by ozonation in the slurry form, (2) the effects of ozonation upon the soil matrix and the biodegradability of the resultant PAH intermediates, and (3) the feasibility of a combined technique using O3 as a pretreatment followed by biological degradation. The sediment was made into 3% w/w soil slurries and ozonated in a 1.7-L semi-batch, well-stirred reactor equipped with pH control and a cold trap for the gaseous effluent. Samples were collected after different ozonation durations and tested for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), UV absorbance, and toxicity, along with quantitative and qualitative determinations of the parent and daughter intermediates using gas chromatography/flame ionization detection (GC/FID), GC/mass spectrometry (MS), and ion chromatography (IC) techniques. The GC/MS technique identified 16 compounds associated with the humic and solid phases of the sediment. Intermediates identified at different ozonation times suggested that the degradation of PAHs was initiated by an O3 attack resulting in ring cleavage, followed by the intermediates' oxidation reactions with O3 and the concomitant OH radical toward their mineralization. Results suggested that ozonation for 2 hr removed 50-100% of various PAHs in the solid and liquid phases (as well as the aqueous and gaseous media resulting from the treatment process) of the sediment sample and that organic and inorganic constituents of the sediment were also altered by ozonation. Measurements and comparisons of BOD, COD, UV absorbance, and toxicity of the samples further suggested that ozonation improved the bioavailability and biodegradability of the contaminants, despite the increased toxicity of the treatment effluent.

14611192,"Conformational and structural changes of cod myosin at pH 2.5 and 11 and after subsequent pH readjustment to pH 7.5 were studied. Results suggest that on acid unfolding, the myosin rod may fully dissociate due to electrostatic repulsion within the coiled coil, while it does not dissociate at alkaline pH. Both pHs led to significant conformational changes in the globular head fraction of the myosin heavy chains, suggesting that it takes on a molten globular configuration. A large part of the myosin light chains are lost on both pH treatments. On pH readjustment to neutrality, the heavy chains take on a structural form similar to the native state with the coiled-coil rod reassociating from acid pH while leaving the globular head less packed, more hydrophobic and structurally less stable. The irreversible change brought about in the globular head region leads to the failure of light chains to reassemble onto it, a drastic loss in ATPase activity, and more exposure of reactive thiol groups. The acid and alkali processes therefore lead to substantial changes in the globular part of the myosin molecule and perhaps more importantly to different molecular changes in myosin, depending on which pH treatment is employed.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D005399', 'D006863', 'D018482', 'D009218', 'D011487', 'D017510', 'D013050', 'D055672', 'D014783']","['Animals', 'Fishes', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Myosins', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Static Electricity', 'Viscosity']",Changes in conformation and subunit assembly of cod myosin at low and high pH and after subsequent refolding.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14611192,2004

Under these conditions the initial COD was reduced by about 97% within 6 h of treatment. The intermediates detected by LC-(EI)MS in the oxidation of hydroquinone and phenidone during the treatment were essentially hydroxylated derivatives and dimers and the residual organic matter was mainly made up of carboxylic acids. Reaction pathways for the oxidation of the developing agents hydroquinone and phenidone were proposed. The presence of many organic and inorganic components in the wastewaters did not affected the favoured oxidation route of these developers. The results obtained allow to assess the reduction of costs permitted in the treatment of X-ray effluents with the photo- and thermal-Fenton reaction without affecting the degradation degree and quality of the discharge.",Water research,"['D002853', 'D013058', 'D009930', 'D010084', 'D014865', 'D014962']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'X-Ray Film']",Degradation of medical x-ray film developing wastewaters by advanced oxidation processes.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12230167,2002

Accordingly, the two acidic lipid were identified as GT3 and GQ1c, respectively. Another A2B5-reactive acidic lipid in the tissue was tentatively assigned to GT2 based upon its reactivity to A2B5 and chromatographic mobility on thin-layer chromatography.

Interestingly, the percentages of c-series gangliosides within total gangliosides of hepatopancreas and cerebral ganglion were even higher than that of cod fish brain, which is known to be highly enriched with this ganglioside species.

Canned products of three manufacturers were examined. Mean contents of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in the oil and solids were 31.91 +/- 1.83 and 16.59 +/- 7.48 g/100 g, respectively, the respective contents of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) being 17.88 +/- 1.69 and 8.79 +/- 3.67 g/100 g.

Anodic hemoglobins initiated lipid oxidation in washed cod muscle much more rapidly than cathodic hemoglobins, as measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation. Moreover, anodic hemoglobins appeared to oxidize more rapidly as compared to cathodic hemoglobins in the washed cod muscle model system, as measured by a decrease in redness (a value).

11398744,"The catabolic fate of circulating hyaluronan and the proteoglycan chondroitin sulphate (CSPG) was studied in the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.). Distribution studies using radio-iodinated ligand demonstrated that CSPG was rapidly eliminated from the blood by the endocardial endothelial cells (EECs) of the heart atrium and ventricle. The presence of excess amounts of hyaluronan or CSPG inhibited uptake of [125I]hyaluronan into cultured atrial EECs (aEECs) by 46% and 84%, respectively. Neither formaldehyde-treated serum albumin (FSA) nor mannose inhibited this uptake. The presence of excess amounts of CSPG and hyaluronan inhibited uptake of [125I]CSPG by 90% and 42%, respectively, suggesting that aEECs express a specific hyaluronan binding site that also recognizes CSPG. FSA inhibited endocytosis of [1251]CSPG by 65%, indicating that CSPG is also recognized by the scavenger receptor. Approximately 17% and 57% of added [125I]hyaluronan and 15% and 65% of the added [125I]CSPG were endocytosed after 1 and 24h, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatographic analyses of the spent medium after endocytosis of hyaluronan and CSPG serglycin labelled biosynthetically with 3H in the acetyl groups identified labelled the low-molecular-mass degradation products as [3H]acetate, indicating that aEECs operate anaerobically.

11358181,"Dioxins/furans are ubiquitous environmental contaminants whose primary route of human exposure occurs via the consumption of fatty foods of animal origin. The US FDA conducted a market basket survey of dairy products and commercial fish and shellfish to obtain data on levels of 17 dioxin/furan congeners (2, 3, 7, 8-congeners) in the US. The dairy products sampled included various cheeses (American, cheddar, Swiss, cottage), ice cream, yogurt, butter, and milk. The finfish and shellfish (molluscs and crustacea) sampled are those marine species consumed in the greatest amounts and include canned tuna, shrimp, cod, blue crab, and oysters. Catfish was sampled because it is the dominant aquaculture species. Samples were collected in 1995/96 and analysis for 17 dioxin/furan congeners was performed by high-resolution gas chromatography following extraction and clean-up. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for each congener in each food were reported. Point estimates of exposure were calculated using a 3-day (1-day diary plus 2-day recall) food consumption survey for eaters-only and for the general population (USDA/CSFII, 1989-92). Toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) were used to derive overall dioxin/furan toxicity equivalents (TEQ) for each sample food. Mean estimates of TEQ exposure for each food were derived using five values for non-detects (ND = 0; ND = 1/2 LOD or LOQ, ND = LOD or LOQ) on both a total sample and eaters-only basis. Using zero and the LOD provide lower and upper bounds on the range of estimated exposure, respectively. The bounds on mean dioxin intakes (pg/person/day) calculated for consumers of specific foods were estimated as follows (using zero or LOD for non-detects): butter (0.5-11), cheese (1.6-3.2), ice cream (4-19), yogurt (0.8-28), catfish (148-150), fish (other than catfish) (0.03-9), crustacea (32-35), mollusks (16.1-16.6), and shrimp (0.09-4.5).

Flounders were collected from the western Gulf of Finland in July 1996, September 1997, and September 1998, and from the Gulf of Bothnia in August 1997 and September 1998. Flounders were also collected from the coastal areas of Sweden in the Baltic Proper during September 1998. Cod were caught from the southern Baltic Sea in August 1998. Livers and muscles of the 1997 fish were isolated, extracted, and analysed for nodularin using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibition assay. Approximately 30-70 ng of nodularin/g dry weight (maximum value 140 ng/g) were found in the liver tissue samples by ELISA and PP1 inhibition. These concentrations were below the detection limit of HPLC. PP1 assay showed inhibition also in muscle samples, but this may due to other compounds present in the muscle extracts rather than NODLN or due to matrix interference. The recovery of nodularin from liver tissue with ELISA and PP1 assays was about 30%. Nodularin concentrations in samples are not corrected for recovery.

In this study, total lipids of cod muscle were separated into neutral and polar lipids, which were further fractionated by HPLC. The lipid fractions were tested in vitro, against washed rabbit platelets, for the probable existence of lipid compounds that either exhibit an action similar to that of platelet-activating factor (PAF) or inhibit the action of PAF. The platelet bioassay was used to evaluate total lipids, total polar lipids, and total neutral lipids, before any further separation. Detection of these compounds in fresh and fried cod could be used to evaluate the nutritional value of this important fish. The in vitro biological study of lipids showed that in fresh cod lipid fractions, ranges of PAF-like and anti-PAF-like activities were present, whereas in fried cod lipid fractions, both neutral and polar, anti-PAF activities were mainly observed.

SS, VSS, COD, BOD5, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn concentrations were measured for an important number of rain events in roof, yard, street runoff, as well as in dry and wet weather flows at the catchment outlet. Mass entry-exit totals, at the scale of the catchment, were calculated over 31 rain events in order to evaluate the contribution of different types of runoff, of sanitary sewage and of sewer sediments to the total wet weather pollutant loads at the catchment outlet. The erosion of in-sewer pollutant stocks was found to be the main source of particles and of organic matter in wet weather flows, whereas heavy metal loads mainly originated from roof runoff, due to the corrosion of metallic roofs. Particles eroded inside the sewer during rain events were found to be quite different from the particles constituting the main part of sewer sediments: they are organic and biodegradable, with rather important settling velocities and seem to accumulate during dry weather periods.

11110104,"Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs to combat bacterial infections in cod (Gadus morhua) and wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) is limited. One antimicrobial agent likely to be effective is flumequine. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of flumequine in these two species. Flumequine was administered intravenously to cod (G. morhua) at a dose of 5 mg/kg bodyweight and wrasse (C. rupestris) at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Flumequine was also administered orally to both species at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight, and as a bath treatment at a dose of 10 mg/L water for 2 h. Identical experimental designs were used otherwise. The study was performed in seawater with a salinity of 3.2% and a temperature of 8.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C (cod) and 14.5 +/- 0.4 degrees C (wrasse). Pharmacokinetic modelling of the data showed that flumequine had quite different pharmacokinetic properties in cod and wrasse.

11064127,"In order to perform environmental risk assessments with regard to oil contamination in the sea, it is important to obtain knowledge about threshold levels for possible adverse effects in marine organisms. With this objective in mind, selected biomarkers were studied in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) chronically exposed to mechanically dispersed crude oil. The fish were exposed for 30 days in a continuous flow system to nominal concentrations of 0.06, 0.25 and 1 ppm North Sea crude oil. Fish were sampled five times during the exposure period. In addition, the 1 ppm group and the control group were sampled 1 week after the end of exposure. Polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in the seawater were analysed regularly by direct fluorescence and, at one occasion, by gas chromatography with mass spectrographic detection (GC/MS) measurements. Liver samples were analysed for parent PAH levels by means of GC/MS measurements, and PAH metabolites in bile were analysed by means of fixed wavelength fluorescence. Cytochrome P450 induction in liver was estimated by ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, and hepatic DNA adducts were analysed by the 32P-postlabelling assay. The parent PAH concentrations in liver showed peak levels 3 days after the start of exposure, followed by a reduction towards the end of the experiment. In contrast, the PAH metabolites in bile and EROD activity showed generally increasing levels throughout the whole exposure period, indicating an increased biotransformation efficiency. The level of DNA adducts in the 1 ppm group showed a stable increase during the entire exposure period. Only a slight, non-significant decrease in DNA adduct levels was observed after 7 days of recovery in clean water. Exposure-dependent responses were observed for all three biomarkers. The lowest nominal concentration of dispersed oil in water, 0.06 ppm, corresponded to a measured total PAH concentration in the water of 0.3 ppb. Atlantic cod exposed to this concentration showed increased levels of PAH metabolites in bile and a slight induction of CYP1A, as well as formation of DNA adducts when compared with control fish. Particularly noteworthy is the detection of DNA adducts at such a low exposure concentration of oil in water, which, to our knowledge, is a novel finding. These dose-response data may serve as useful contributions when assessing environmental risk with regard to marine oil pollution.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000818', 'D001646', 'D001664', 'D015415', 'D019363', 'D003577', 'D018736', 'D005399', 'D005618', 'D008401', 'D008099', 'D010578', 'D011786', 'D012307', 'D013050', 'D014874', 'D010130']","['Animals', 'Bile', 'Biliverdine', 'Biomarkers', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'DNA Adducts', 'Fishes', 'Fresh Water', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Liver', 'Petroleum', 'Quality Control', 'Risk Factors', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'p-Aminohippuric Acid']","PAH metabolites in bile, cytochrome P4501A and DNA adducts as environmental risk parameters for chronic oil exposure: a laboratory experiment with Atlantic cod.","[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000633', None, None, None, 'Q000633', 'Q000378']","[None, 'drug effects', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'toxicity', None, None, None, 'toxicity', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11064127,2001

Since little is known of the selenium forms in fish, we have studied soluble selenium compounds in fish species, and compared different techniques for fractionation of selenocompounds (size-exclusion chromatography, ultrafiltration, and precipitation with trichloroacetic acid). The size-exclusion column (Superdex 200 HR 10/30) was coupled on-line to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The limit of detection was 0.20 microgram l-1 and the selenium response was linear in the investigated concentration range of 0-20 micrograms l-1 (r2 = 0.98). For plaice 47% of the selenium was extractable while the extraction efficiency for cod was 23%. The fish extracts were injected onto the column four times each and the variation in the quantitative data for different selenium-containing fractions between the runs was small (RSD < 10%). The recovery of selenium in the chromatographic step was about 70%, indicating some interaction between the fish extracts and the column material. Ultrafiltration using a membrane with a cut-off at M(r) 10,000 gave results similar to the size-exclusion fractionation, for cod about 20% of the soluble selenium had a M(r) < 10,000 and the corresponding value for plaice was 69%.

Because no procedure was available for AC testing in hair, a new method was developed for the simultaneous identification and quantitation of morphine (MOR), codeine (COD), 6-AM, and AC. After decontamination, each hair specimen was cut into 1-mm pieces. A 50-mg aliquot was incubated overnight at 50 degrees C in 1 mL Soerensen buffer (pH 7.6) in presence of 200 ng of MOR-d3, COD-d3, 6-AM-d3, and AC-d3. After pH adjustment to 8.4, the analytes were extracted in 5 mL of chloroform/isopropanol/n-heptane (25:10:65, v/v/v). The organic phase was removed and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was derivatized by silylation (BSTFA + 1% TMCS). Drugs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in electron impact mode. Limits of quantitation were set to 0.1 ng/mg. Fifty hair specimens obtained from subjects who died from fatal opiate overdose were analyzed. AC was detected in 22 samples in concentrations ranging from 0.17 to 5.60 ng/mg with a mean value of 1.04 ng/mg. 6-AM was also present in these samples at concentrations ranging from 1.35 to 41.10 ng/mg with a mean value of 7.79 ng/mg. Of the 28 specimens negative for AC, 21 were positive for 6-AM at concentrations ranging from 0.18 to 7.13 ng/mg.

There was a positive relationship between AC concentrations and 6-AM concentrations (r = 0.915, p = 0.001). Neither AC nor COD was identified in hair specimens collected from 20 subjects taking part in a heroin-maintenance program in Switzerland and receiving pure pharmaceutical heroin hydrochloride daily.

9688955,"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was isolated from an extract of the intestine of the cod Gadus morhua. The primary structure of this 37-amino acid peptide was established as follows: ACNTA TCVTH RLADF LSRSG GIGNS NFVPT NVGSK AF-NH2. The peptide shows close structural similarities to other nonmammalian (3-4 amino acid substitutions) and mammalian (5-8 amino acid substitutions) CGRPs, and it contains the two residues Asp14 and Phe15 that seem to be characteristic for CGRP in nonmammalian vertebrates. Cod CGRP (10(-9)-10(-7) M) inhibited the motility of spontaneously active ring preparations from the cod intestine and was significantly (P < 0.05) more potent than rat alpha-CGRP. Neither prostaglandins nor nitric oxide is involved in the inhibitory response produced by cod CGRP, and the lack of effect of tetrodotoxin suggests an action of CGRP on receptors on the intestinal smooth muscle cells. The competitive CGRP antagonist human alpha-CGRP-(8-37) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the response to cod CGRP. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated CGRP-immunoreactive neurons intrinsic to the intestine, and a dense innervation with immunoreactive nerve fibers was observed in the myenteric plexus and the circular muscle layer.

1480551,"The disposition of 14C-labelled hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 2,4',5-trichlorobiphenyl (triCB) was studied in cod (Gadus morhua) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). For both compounds tape section autoradiography revealed substantial amounts of radiolabelled material in the central nervous system (CNS) of cod, whereas only traces of radioactivity were observed in the CNS of rainbow trout. Furthermore, an enrichment of radiolabelled compound in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was observed in the cod, whereas no radioactivity could be detected in the CSF of rainbow trout. According to autoradiography, the CNS of cod dosed with HCB contained the parent compound, whereas the major part of radioactivity in CSF was due to HCB metabolites. Thin-layer chromatography of extracts from cod dosed with triCB showed the presence of parent compound in the CNS, whereas part of the radioactivity in the CSF was due to triCB metabolites. The activities of cytochrome P-450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase in the CNS of cod and rainbow trout were determined in microsomal and mitochondrial fractions. Both species expressed activities which were in the same order of magnitude as those reported for the corresponding fractions from rat brain. Incubation of triCB with cod brain mitochondria and microsomes resulted in the formation of two polar metabolites.

Peptide tyrosine-tyrosine, with the same primary structure as the brain peptide, was also isolated from an extract of the trout stomach. The data indicate that a peptide analogous to mammalian neuropeptide Y is present in the brain of teleost fish and a peptide analogous to mammalian peptide tyrosine-tyrosine is present in brain, gastrointestinal tissue and pancreas.

Fish oils gave a characteristic Ag(+)-HPLC profile, typified by sharp, intense peaks at the start of the chromatogram and broad, multiple nongaussian peaks for the late eluting components. Triglycerides ranging from those that were wholly saturated to those containing 16 double bonds were isolated. Cod (Gadus spp.), saithe (Pollachius virens) and monkfish (Squatina squatina) liver oils gave similar triglyceride profiles.

1430418,"Chum salmon (oncorhynchus keta) stanniocalcin was purified, partially identified and tested for bioactivity in an assay on the intestinal calcium uptake in a marine teleost (Gadus morhua). Basic ethanol extraction, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography resulted in the isolation of a homogeneous glycoprotein that appears as a 46-kDa product under nonreducing conditions and as a 23-kDa product under reducing conditions after sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The glycoprotein is likely to be a homodimer composed of two subunits of 23 kDa each. Further characterization indicates homology to Australian eel, sockeye salmon, coho salmon and rainbow trout stanniocalcin, and the glycoprotein is thus concluded to be stanniocalcin. Stanniocalcin-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated in the corpuscles of Stannius of the Atlantic cod, with a specific antiserum raised against purified chum salmon stanniocalcin. The physiological importance and the biological activity of chum salmon stanniocalcin was tested by evaluating its effect on intestinal calcium uptake by the Atlantic cod in vitro. The intestine was perfused, both vascularly and through the intestinal lumen, and the calcium mucosa-to-serosa flux was measured using 45Ca2+ as a tracer. Stanniocalcin decreased the intestinal calcium uptake in a dose-related manner by 13.5% and 22.4% at doses of 2.2 and 10.9 nM stanniocalcin, respectively.

Fibre bundles were subjected to sinusoidal cycles of shortening and lengthening about their in situ fibre length, and stimulated at selected phases in each cycle. The preparations were poisoned with iodoacetic acid and bubbled with nitrogen to block the synthesis of ATP. After an initial rapid decline over the first 10 cycles, force and net work remained steady in some cases for up to 64 oscillatory length cycles, but more commonly declined slowly after about 30 cycles. The total mechanical work performed increased largely in proportion to the number of work cycles. At the end of each experiment fibres were frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen and metabolite concentrations determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzymatic analysis. Concentrations of adenylates did not differ significantly from control values, although a significant increase in IMP concentrations at 64 cycles accounted for the maintenance of relatively high energy charge values. Creatine (C) concentrations increased and creatine phosphate (CP) concentrations decreased, implying a tight coupling of the ATP/ADP reaction to the CP/C reaction. Muscle economy was calculated as the positive work performed during a work cycle divided by the total chemical energy expended. These values (approx. 7 mJ mumol-1) were found to be independent of the number of work cycles performed, although a trend to increase was observed.

2010465,"Assembly of brain microtubule proteins isolated from the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, was found to be much less sensitive to colchicine than assembly of bovine brain microtubules, which was completely inhibited by low colchicine concentrations (10 microM). The degree of disassembly by colchicine was also less for cod microtubules. The lack of colchicine effect was not caused by a lower affinity of colchicine to cod tubulin, as colchicine bound to cod tubulin with a dissociation constant, Kd, and a binding ratio close to that of bovine tubulin. Cod brain tubulin was highly acetylated and mainly detyrosinated, as opposed to bovine tubulin. When cod tubulin, purified by means of phosphocellulose chromatography, was assembled by addition of DMSO in the absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), the microtubules became sensitive to low concentrations of colchicine. They were, however, slightly more stable to disassembly, indicating that posttranslational modifications induce a somewhat increased stability to colchicine. The stability was mainly MAPs dependent, as it increased markedly in the presence of MAPs. The stability was not caused by an extremely large amount of cod MAPs, since there were slightly less MAPs in cod than in bovine microtubules. When ""hybrid"" microtubules were assembled from cod tubulin and bovine MAPs, these microtubules became less sensitive to colchicine. This was not a general effect of MAPs, since bovine MAPs did not induce a colchicine stability of microtubules assembled from bovine tubulin.

In combination with titration curve analysis, we have screened the effect of buffer pHs, feed conductivity and protein loading, on the product recovery and purity. We have developed elution conditions which allow effective separation of the cod DNase from bounded impurities, such as proteinases and nucleic acids. Low levels of these impurities were regarded as essential for the desired product quality. The optimum resolution and maximum purification (ca. 20-fold increase in specific activity) of DNase, was, however, achieved at low protein loading (2.6 mg ml-1 gel), corresponding to less than 4% of the dynamic bed capacity. Scale-up to a 2.5 l pilot scale column (axial flow) and a 0.25 l radial flow column showed that the separation and yield obtained at laboratory scale was retained, and was independent of column geometry and bed height.

Four distinct antifreeze protein classes differing in carbohydrate content, amino acid composition, protein sequence and secondary structure are currently known. Although all of these antifreezes are relatively small (2.6-33 kd) it was generally thought that they were excluded from the urine by a variety of glomerular mechanisms. In the present study antifreeze polypeptides were found in the bladder urine of winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), sea raven (Hemitripterus americanus), ocean pout (Macrozoarces americanus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Since the plasma of each of these fish contains a different antifreeze class it would appear that all four classes of antifreeze can enter the urine. The major antifreeze components in the urine of winter flounder were found to be identical to the major plasma components in terms of high performance liquid chromatography retention times and amino acid composition.

3791491,"The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon phenanthrene was converted mainly (greater than 90%) to the 1,2-dihydrodiol when metabolized in vivo by the marine teleost cod. This is also found in other bony fishes, but contrary to what is known from cartilaginous fish, crustaceans and mammals, where the K-region 9,10-dihydrodiol is the main metabolite. When liver microsomal preparations from differently pretreated cod were incubated with phenanthrene in vitro, the metabolic profile was dramatically different from the in vivo pattern, as shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The microsomes from untreated, phenanthrene, phenobarbital and pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile-treated cod converted phenanthrene mainly, but to a varying extent, to the 9,10-dihydrodiol. Treatment with beta-naphthoflavone (BNF), however, resulted in a large increase in the oxidation at the 1,2-position, along with a four- to seven-fold increase in specific activity. The major cytochrome P-450 isozyme purified from BNF-treated cod liver (P-450c) showed highest activity with phenanthrene (a turnover of 0.18 nmol/min per nmol P-450), but with about equal selectivity for the 1,2- and 9,10-region of the substrate in a reconstituted system with phospholipid and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. The low regioselectivity was also observed as a lack of regioselective inhibition of microsomal phenanthrene metabolism with antiserum to cod P-450c. Two of the minor isozymes, cod cytochromes P-450b and d, showed a similar turnover to P-450c, but with a stronger selectivity for the 1,2-position (55-60%). The results indicate that other control systems, in addition to the content of individual P-450-forms in the regulatory systems, in addition to the content of individual P-450-forms in the endoplasmic reticulum, are involved in the in vivo transformation of phenanthrene by cod to the 1,2-dihydrodiol metabolite.",Chemico-biological interactions,"['D000818', 'D001571', 'D003577', 'D004591', 'D004790', 'D005399', 'D008401', 'D007527', 'D008862', 'D010616', 'D019324']","['Animals', 'Benzoflavones', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Fishes', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Isoenzymes', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Phenanthrenes', 'beta-Naphthoflavone']",Regioselective metabolism of phenanthrene in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua): studies on the effects of monooxygenase inducers and role of cytochromes P-450.,"[None, 'Q000494', 'Q000096', None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000096', 'Q000201', 'Q000378', None]","[None, 'pharmacology', 'biosynthesis', None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'biosynthesis', 'enzymology', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3791491,1987

When mixtures containing polyunsaturated fats (mackerel oil and cod-liver oil which contain relatively large proportions of C20:5 and C22:6) were exposed to gamma-irradiation, large concentrations of lipid peroxide were formed and a concomitant oxidation of BP to mutagenic and toxic BP quinones took place. The rate of BP oxidation was closely related to the extent of peroxidation of the lipids in the starch mixtures and was dependent on the dose of gamma-irradiation and the presence of air. Mackerel oil also underwent peroxidation during the storage of both irradiated and unirradiated starch/mackerel oil/BP mixtures and this resulted in a significant oxidation of the BP present in these samples. Antioxidants such as vitamin E and BHA inhibited both lipid peroxidation and BP oxidation resulting from gamma-irradiation. These results demonstrate that the species generated during the peroxidation of unsaturated fats in foodstuffs can react with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as BP and convert them into active mutagenic and toxic products. This has important toxicological implications, particularly as the consumption of polyunsaturated fat in the Western world is increasing and gamma-irradiation may soon be widely used for food sterilization.","International journal of radiation biology and related studies in physics, chemistry, and medicine","['D001564', 'D002083', 'D050260', 'D002851', 'D005227', 'D005526', 'D050356', 'D008054', 'D008315', 'D010084', 'D010100', 'D013997', 'D014810']","['Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Butylated Hydroxyanisole', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fatty Acids', 'Food, Formulated', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxides', 'Malondialdehyde', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen', 'Time Factors', 'Vitamin E']",The oxidation of benzo[a]pyrene mediated by lipid peroxidation in irradiated synthetic diets.,"['Q000378', 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000528', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000494']","['metabolism', 'pharmacology', None, None, 'analysis', 'radiation effects', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3485594,1986

870492,"Methods are described for analyses of methoxychlor (2,2-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane) in tissues of fish and invertebrate animals and in water samples. These micro methods offer economy in solvents and materials, and reduce health and fire hazards. Furthermore, the methods sufficiently reduce sample weights to allow analyses of small animals (mayflies) or animal organs. Samples are extracted in a ball-mill with n-hexane, and lipids are removed from fatty samples by freezeout. Small Florisil columns give final lipid cleanup and partial separation of methoxychlor from interfering materials. Methoxychlor is determined on a short gas-liquid chromatographic column (retention time 2.2 min). Animal tissue samples as small as 0.1 g and water samples of 5 ml can be analyzed at sensitivities of 10 and 1 ppb, respectively. Methoxychlor recoveries were 84-101% (fish and crab tissue), 92-100% (cod liver oil), and 98-107% (water) over a concentration range of 0.-10 ppm.

1237201,"With the intention of increasing our knowledge about the actual degree of heavy metal accumulation in fish, the contents of the elements manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and mercury in certain fish species (cod and plaice) from onshore and offshore waters of the German Bight have been determined. The measurements have been performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry: Flame AAS was used as investigating procedure for the determination of Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn. A non-flame atomization system with a heated graphite tube was used for the determination of Cd, Pb, Co, and Ni. The concentration of total Hg was estimated according to the so-called ""cold vapour atomic absorption method"". In order to avoid errors in interpretation of measured values of Co and Ni, which occured as a result of matrix effects, a special technique has been developed. This based upon an selective separation and enrichment by chelate exchanger chromatography (""Chelex 100""). The analytical data obtained are plotted in a diagram with log.-log. scale. The content is shown on the x-axis, and the corresponding relative reproducibility (variation coefficient) of the method used is shown on the y-axis. For all elements investigated certain levels have been found out. From an examination of the results it appeared that there were comparatively small differences in the prevailing concentrations of transition metals Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn between samples of the same species from different areas. Likewise, the levels estimated for plaice did not differ from those estimated for cod. There is some evidence of elevated levels of Cd, Pb, and Hg in plaice from areas along the coastline.",Zeitschrift fur Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung,"['D000818', 'D002104', 'D003035', 'D003300', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D007501', 'D007854', 'D008345', 'D008628', 'D008670', 'D009132', 'D009532', 'D013045', 'D015032']","['Animals', 'Cadmium', 'Cobalt', 'Copper', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Iron', 'Lead', 'Manganese', 'Mercury', 'Metals', 'Muscles', 'Nickel', 'Species Specificity', 'Zinc']","The levels of heavy metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg) in fish from onshore and offshore waters of the German bight.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1237201,1975
5000276,"1. Before the uptake of water that precedes spawning, eggs of cod (Gadus morhua L.) contained 30% dry matter, of which 80% was protein. Some 75% of this protein was soluble in 0.5m-sodium chloride. The major components in the extract were two similar lipoproteins, of molecular weight about 400000, containing 21% lipid, some two-thirds of which was phospholipid, and about 0.5% protein phosphorus. 2. These lipoproteins were identified by immunochemical methods in the serum of female cod with developing ovaries, but not in the serum of male or of immature female fish. 3. The concentrations of egg proteins in the serum of female cod were determined by a serial-dilution double-diffusion immunological method, and were shown to increase with development of the ovaries, reaching a value of about 32mg/ml when the weight of the ovaries was 10% of the weight of the fish. 4. Immature male and female cod were injected intramuscularly with a solution of oestradiol-17beta 3-benzoate in oil and the concentration of egg proteins in their serum was measured by the immunodiffusion method. The serum contained no detectable egg proteins before injection of the fish, but 30mug of oestradiol benzoate/kg gave rise to detectable amounts of egg proteins in 10 days, and with 300mug or 1mg of oestradiol benzoate/kg the concentration of egg proteins rose to 32mg/ml. The values for male and female cod were similar and represented about one-half of the total serum protein. 5. With a dose of 1mg of oestradiol benzoate/kg, egg proteins were first detected in the serum 2 days after injection and the concentration increased up to 10 days. 6. Serum samples taken before and 10 days after an injection of 1mg of oestradiol benzoate/kg were fractionated by gel-filtration on Sephadex G-200. The difference curves obtained from fractionation curves after and before injection confirmed the values of the concentrations of egg proteins obtained from the immunodiffusion test and showed that the concentrations of the normal serum components fell by 20-50% of the initial value, the high-molecular-weight globulins showing the most marked fall. 7.
