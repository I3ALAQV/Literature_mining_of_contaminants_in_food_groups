34829641,"Culinary spices and herbs have been used to impart a characteristic flavour and aroma in food due to their appealing fragrance. Recently, bioactive compounds from herbs, especially phenolics, have gained much attention due to their potential health outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize and quantify the phenolic compounds from 10 widely used Australian-grown herbs (oregano, rosemary, bay, basil, sage, fenugreek, dill, parsley, mint and thyme). For this purpose, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for the complete profiling of polyphenolic compounds and quantification of abundant phenolic compounds was completed with high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA). Polyphenols from Australian-grown herbs were estimated through total phenolic content (TP), total flavonoids (TF) and total tannins (TT) along with their in-vitro antioxidant activities. Oregano and mint were estimated with the highest value of TP (140.59 ± 9.52 and 103.28 ± 8.08 mg GAE/g, milligram gallic acid equivalent/gram) while rosemary and mint had the highest TF (8.19 ± 0.74 and 7.05 ± 0.43 mg QE (quercetin equivalent)/g). In this study, eighty-four (84) phenolic compounds were screened and confirmed through LC-MS/MS by comparing their masses and fragmentation pattern with published libraries. The results of this study validate the use of these herbs as bioactives and their positive impact on human health.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],LC-MS/MS-QTOF Screening and Identification of Phenolic Compounds from Australian Grown Herbs and Their Antioxidant Potential.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34829641,2021
34753973,"Nine odorless laboratory-collected hydro-distilled aqueous extracts (basil, calendula, centrifuged oregano, corn silk, laurel, oregano, rosemary, spearmint, thyme) and one industrial steam-distilled oregano hydrolate acquired as by-products of essential oils purification were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against three Salmonella Typhimurium strains (4/74, FS8, FS115) at 4 and 37 °C. Susceptibility to the extracts was mainly plant- and temperature-dependent, though strain dependent effects were also observed. Industrial oregano hydrolate eliminated strains immediately after inoculation, exhibiting the highest antimicrobial potential. Hydro-distilled extracts eliminated/reduced Salmonella levels during incubation at 4 °C. At 37 °C, oregano, centrifuged oregano, thyme, calendula and basil were bactericidal while spearmint, rosemary and corn silk bacteriostatic. A strain-dependent effect was observed for laurel. The individual or combined effect of marinades and edible coatings prepared of industrial hydrolate and hydro-distilled oregano extracts with or without oregano essential oil (OEO) was tested in pork meat at 4 °C inoculated with FS8 strain. Lower in situ activity was observed compared to in vitro assays. Marinades and edible coatings prepared of industrial oregano hydrolate + OEO were the most efficient in inhibiting pathogen. Marination in oregano extract and subsequent coating with either 50% oregano extract + OEO or water + OEO enhanced the performance of oregano extract.

It also focuses on their bioactive properties, namely antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, anti-tyrosinase, and anti-diabetic activities. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in order to understand the correlation between the chemical composition and bioactive properties of the tisanes. The tisane 5 (T5) composed by lemon thyme, tutsan, cloves, and cinnamon, was the most promising mixture, presenting the lowest values for the lipid peroxidation inhibition, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic activity. It also presented the highest concentration of phenolic acids (caffeoylquinic acids derivatives), and flavan-3-ols (catechin derivatives). Only the dry plants presented tocopherols. For the antihemolytic, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activity, T2 and T4 (with lemon thyme) were highlighted as the best herbal mixtures. The PCA proved to be a valid tool to select the most promising tisane according to the bioactivity.

Therefore, it is very important to focus on the hygiene of these plants so as to make sure they are safe for consumption. This work aimed to monitor the common heavy and radioactive elements in some commonly used herbs: anise, chamomile, clover, cumin, coriander, fennel, roselle, rosemary, sage, and thyme. A total of 12 elements were measured including 2 radionuclides, Al, As, Cd, Hg, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, Sr, Th, U, and V. Heavy metals are ecologically and biologically important, and may be involved in some health disorder symptoms within the human body. Samples were digested with a microwave digester and measurements were completed with ICP-MS/MS in Helium mode to increase sensitivity, lower the background, and avoid interferences. Method validation and verification were performed through the spiking process at 2.0 µg/kg level, and then RSD, LOD, and LOQ were calculated. Recoveries ranged from 93-103% for all elements and RSD% from 2.8-9.6%.

32020196,"Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae) is one of the most medically important mosquito species, due to its ability to spread viruses of yellow fever, dengue fever, and Zika in humans. In this study, the insecticidal activity of 17 plant essential oils was evaluated via topical application against two strains of Ae. aegypti mosquito, Orlando (insecticide-susceptible) and Puerto Rico (pyrethroid-resistant). Initial screens with the Orlando strain showed that cucumber seed oil (2017 sample) was the most toxic, followed by sandalwood and thyme oil. When the essential oils were mixed with permethrin, they failed to show any significant synergism of insecticidal activity. Sandalwood and thyme oils displayed consistently high mortality against the resistant Puerto Rico strain, with low resistance ratios of 2.1 and 1.4, respectively. In contrast, cucumber seed oil showed significantly less activity against Puerto Rico mosquitoes, with a resistance ratio of 45. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the 2017 sample of cucumber seed oil sample via flash column chromatography produced 11 fractions, and gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the three active fractions were contaminated with 0.33, 0.36, and 0.33% of chlorpyrifos-methyl, an organophosphorus insecticide, whereas inactive fractions did not show any trace of it. These results suggested that the insecticidal activity of cucumber seed oil was probably due to the presence of the insecticide, later confirmed with a clean batch of cucumber seed oil obtained in 2018, which showed negligible insecticidal activity.

The identities of the isolated compounds were established from the respective Kováts indices, and a comparison of mass spectral data was made with those reported earlier. The antibacterial activity was assessed from minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) using the microdilution method. Minimum inhibitory concentration values were 1.25mgmL(-1) for thyme, 5.0mgmL(-1) for basil and marjoram, and 10mgmL(-1) for rosemary, peppermint and anise. All oils showed bactericidal activity at their minimum inhibitory concentration, except anise oil, which was only bacteriostatic.

Results showed that the essential oils, especially of thyme and fennel, have a good inhibitory effect on the development of fungal decay in Thompson table grapes. In addition, essential oils reduced weight loss, berry and rachis browning and had no considerable adverse effect on the flavour of the fruits. GC-MS analysis showed that the main compounds identified in sweet basil, fennel, summer savory and thyme oils are linalool (65.25%), trans-anethole (64.72%), carvacrol (54.14%) and β-ocimene (12.62%), respectively.

Therefore, this compound has attracted great attention in food industry, i.e., it has been used as a natural preservative in foods such as cheese to prevent fungal growth. Previous studies concerning the biotransformation of nerol by Penicillium sp. and microbial transformation of citral by sporulated surface cultures method (SSCM) of Penicillium digitatum have been reported. The objective of this research was to study the pathway involved during biotransformation of citral by Penicillium sp. using two methods. The culture preparation was done using different microbial methods and incubation periods to obtain Penicillium for citral biotransformation. The biotransformation products were identified by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS).

18096925,"The aim of this experiment was to study the effect of the addition, to milk, of an essential oil (EO) obtained from the hydrodistillation of plants collected from a mountain natural pasture on the milk and cheese sensory properties. The EO was mainly composed of terpenoid compounds (67 of the 95 compounds identified) as well as ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, alkanes, and benzenic compounds. In milk, the addition of this EO at the concentration of 0.1 microL/L did not influence its sensory properties, whereas at 1.0 microL/L, sensory properties were modified. In cheeses, the effect of adding EO into milk was studied in an experimental dairy plant allowing the production of small Cantal-type cheeses (10 kg) in 3 vats processed in parallel. The control (C) vat contained 110 L of raw milk; in the other 2 vats, 0.1 microL/L (EO1) or 3.0 microL/L (EO30) of EO were added to 110 L of the same milk. Six replicates were performed. After 5 mo of ripening, chemical and sensory analyses were carried out on the cheeses, including determination of the volatile compounds by dynamic headspace combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The EO did not influence the sensory properties of the cheeses at the lower concentration (EO1). However, the EO30 cheeses had a more intense odor and aroma, both characterized as ""mint/chlorophyll"" and ""thyme/oregano."" These unusual odors and aromas originated directly from the EO added. In total, 152 compounds desorbing from cheese were found, of which 41 had been added with the EO; in contrast, 54 compounds of the EO were not recovered in the cheese. Few volatile compounds desorbing from cheeses, other than the added compounds, were affected by EO addition. Among them, 2-butanol, propanol, and 3-heptanone suggested a slight effect of the EO on lipid catabolism.

17995786,"Intermolecular copigmentation is one of the mechanisms of stabilization of anthocyanins in nature and is also responsible for the characteristic color and stability of aged red wines. In the present study, the effect of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity on phytochemical stability of an ascorbic acid-fortified muscadine grape juice following high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing (400 and 550 MPa for 15 min) and after 21 d of storage at 25 degrees C was investigated. Addition of rosemary and thyme polyphenolic extracts (copigmentation) was evaluated as a means to stabilize anthocyanins and ascorbic acid during pressurization and subsequent storage. Polyphenolic extracts were partially purified in order to reduce their content of PPO substrates, and improve their stabilization properties within juice matrix. Overall PPO activity increased (3- and 2.5-fold) following HHP at 400 and 550 MPa, respectively, although it was significantly lower in copigmented treatments. Higher anthocyanin losses occurred at 400 (approximately 70%) than at 550 MPa (approximately 46%), which were correlated to antioxidant losses (r = 0.89). Similarly, greater ascorbic acid losses were observed at 400 (84%) than at 550 MPa (18%). Copigmentation increased anthocyanin retention in reference to pressurized controls (3- and 3.2-fold for rosemary and thyme treatments, respectively) and decreased ascorbic degradation (20 to 32%). In stored samples, higher anthocyanin content (>2-fold) and antioxidant capacity (>1.5-fold) was observed for copigmented treatments when compared to control juices.

In a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (EOs)-cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and oregano (Origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis), molds (Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (Candida albicans). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were generally lower for oregano EO than for the thyme and cinnamon EOs, especially against the relatively resistant Gram-negative. The persistence of the EOs' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (PCA). More relevant chemicals were selected. In addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (S. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (A. flavus), and a yeast (C. albicans). Of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their MICs, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. To check for possible interactions between components present in the EOs, cinnamon EO was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme EO with thymol, and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified EOs using fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. Synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on A. flavus and for thymol on L. monocytogenes, S. choleraesuis, and A. flavus. In all other cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against S. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic.

A structure-activity relationship study among the active isolates and their related compounds indicated that the presence of a catechol structure played an important role in the inhibitory activity of each compound.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","['D018926', 'D018938', 'D002396', 'D002463', 'D002851', 'D004305', 'D005419', 'D005502', 'D006801', 'D010047', 'D010636', 'D010936', 'D059808', 'D017365', 'D013329']","['Anti-Allergic Agents', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Catechols', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids', 'Food', 'Humans', 'Ovalbumin', 'Phenols', 'Plant Extracts', 'Polyphenols', 'Spices', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",Polyphenols from some foodstuffs as inhibitors of ovalbumin permeation through caco-2 cell monolayers.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000037', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'drug effects', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12843650,2004
12132773,"Successful infection by Listeria monocytogenes is dependent upon a range of bacterial extracellular proteins including a cytolysin termed listeriolysin O and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C. Five plant essential oils--bay, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and thyme--significantly reduced the production of listeriolysin O by L. monocytogenes. The greatest change was observed after culture with oil of thyme, which reduced haemolysis to 52.1 haemolytic units (HU)/ml compared with 99.8 HU/ml observed with the control. Oil of clove was the only oil that also significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C activity. These changes were observed despite the oils causing no change to the final bacterial concentration or total extracellular protein concentration.",Journal of medical microbiology,"['D001427', 'D002849', 'D002935', 'D005054', 'D006360', 'D006460', 'D008089', 'D026323', 'D009822', 'D010713', 'D010938', 'D046930', 'D010738']","['Bacterial Toxins', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum', 'Eugenol', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Hemolysin Proteins', 'Listeria monocytogenes', 'Myristica', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Plant Oils', 'Thymus Plant', 'Type C Phospholipases']",Inhibition of listeriolysin O and phosphatidylcholine-specific production in Listeria monocytogenes by subinhibitory concentrations of plant essential oils.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000096', None, 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000096', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, None, 'biosynthesis', None, 'drug effects', None, None, 'biosynthesis', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12132773,2002
3040629,"Seven different spices (thyme, cinnamon, coriander, caraway, pimento, paprika, black pepper) were treated by gamma radiation at an absorbed dose of 10 kGy, and the effect on chemical quality was determined. The effects of this dose were assessed by spectrophotometric analysis of some water-soluble constituents of spices (carbohydrates; carbonyl compounds) and on the content of water-insoluble steam-volatile oils. The colour of paprika and the content of piperine in pepper held in different packaging materials were measured in unirradiated and irradiated samples as a function of storage time. In all cases irradiation does not bring about any distinct qualitative or quantitative chemical changes based on spectrophotometric analysis of spice extracts.","International journal of radiation applications and instrumentation.

4019987,"To determine salicylate content, 333 food items were analyzed. Foods were homogenized with 25% sodium hydroxide, allowed to stand overnight, acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and then extracted with warm diethylether over 5 hours. The extract was dried and taken up in dilute sodium bicarbonate solution for analysis. Salicylic acid was separated by high performance liquid chromatography and quantified by reading at 235 nm. Salicylic acid standards were used throughout to standardize extractions and analyses. This is the most comprehensive set of data on food salicylates yet published; extraction appears to have been more complete for some foods, giving higher values than those previously published. Most fruits, especially berry fruits and dried fruits, contain salicylate. Vegetables show a wide range from 0 to 6 mg salicylate per 100 gm food (for gherkins). Some herbs and spices were found to contain very high amounts per 100 gm, e.g., curry powder, paprika, thyme, garam masala, and rosemary. Among beverages, tea provides substantial amounts of salicylate. Licorice and peppermint candies and some honeys contain salicylates. Cereals, meat, fish, and dairy products contain none or negligible amounts.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,"['D000434', 'D002851', 'D003212', 'D004040', 'D005504', 'D005638', 'D008460', 'D012459', 'D014675']","['Alcoholic Beverages', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Condiments', 'Dietary Carbohydrates', 'Food Analysis', 'Fruit', 'Meat', 'Salicylates', 'Vegetables']",Salicylates in foods.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4019987,1985
