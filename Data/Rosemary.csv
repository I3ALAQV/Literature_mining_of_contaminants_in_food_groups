34829641,"Culinary spices and herbs have been used to impart a characteristic flavour and aroma in food due to their appealing fragrance. Recently, bioactive compounds from herbs, especially phenolics, have gained much attention due to their potential health outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize and quantify the phenolic compounds from 10 widely used Australian-grown herbs (oregano, rosemary, bay, basil, sage, fenugreek, dill, parsley, mint and thyme). For this purpose, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for the complete profiling of polyphenolic compounds and quantification of abundant phenolic compounds was completed with high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA). Polyphenols from Australian-grown herbs were estimated through total phenolic content (TP), total flavonoids (TF) and total tannins (TT) along with their in-vitro antioxidant activities. Oregano and mint were estimated with the highest value of TP (140.59 ± 9.52 and 103.28 ± 8.08 mg GAE/g, milligram gallic acid equivalent/gram) while rosemary and mint had the highest TF (8.19 ± 0.74 and 7.05 ± 0.43 mg QE (quercetin equivalent)/g). In this study, eighty-four (84) phenolic compounds were screened and confirmed through LC-MS/MS by comparing their masses and fragmentation pattern with published libraries. The results of this study validate the use of these herbs as bioactives and their positive impact on human health.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],LC-MS/MS-QTOF Screening and Identification of Phenolic Compounds from Australian Grown Herbs and Their Antioxidant Potential.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34829641,2021
34753973,"Nine odorless laboratory-collected hydro-distilled aqueous extracts (basil, calendula, centrifuged oregano, corn silk, laurel, oregano, rosemary, spearmint, thyme) and one industrial steam-distilled oregano hydrolate acquired as by-products of essential oils purification were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against three Salmonella Typhimurium strains (4/74, FS8, FS115) at 4 and 37 °C. Susceptibility to the extracts was mainly plant- and temperature-dependent, though strain dependent effects were also observed. Industrial oregano hydrolate eliminated strains immediately after inoculation, exhibiting the highest antimicrobial potential. Hydro-distilled extracts eliminated/reduced Salmonella levels during incubation at 4 °C. At 37 °C, oregano, centrifuged oregano, thyme, calendula and basil were bactericidal while spearmint, rosemary and corn silk bacteriostatic. A strain-dependent effect was observed for laurel. The individual or combined effect of marinades and edible coatings prepared of industrial hydrolate and hydro-distilled oregano extracts with or without oregano essential oil (OEO) was tested in pork meat at 4 °C inoculated with FS8 strain. Lower in situ activity was observed compared to in vitro assays. Marinades and edible coatings prepared of industrial oregano hydrolate + OEO were the most efficient in inhibiting pathogen. Marination in oregano extract and subsequent coating with either 50% oregano extract + OEO or water + OEO enhanced the performance of oregano extract.

30637439,"The Nrf2 signaling pathway is highly significant for redox homeostasis. Hence, nutrients and drugs activating Nrf2 can prevent oxidative stress-mediated medical conditions. After activation, Nrf2 accumulates in the cell nucleus; therefore, stimulation of Nrf2 by food components and drugs is usually monitored by measuring nuclear Nrf2 levels. The present study developed a targeted mass spectrometry method for the highly reliable quantification of nuclear Nrf2 levels. Three Nrf2-specific peptides were detected after enzymatic digestion of the nuclear fraction by the developed protocol for micro-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode (microLC-MS/MS-sMRM). The method also identified nuclear Nrf2 unequivocally and specifically in the SDS-PAGE fraction of 100-150 kDa. Moreover, highly precise and linear relative quantification was achieved (mean relative standard deviation 8.3%; coefficient of determination 0.998). Incubation experiments in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells revealed significantly up to 6-fold elevated nuclear Nrf2 levels after stimulation with 10 μM carnosol (rosemary), 10 μM sulforaphane (broccoli), or 20 μM cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon). Our results were in very good accordance with conventional Nrf2 western blotting and were highly correlated with the food components' effect on the expression levels of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 and thioredoxin reductase 1, two major Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective enzymes.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of potentially toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in spices marketed in Brazil. The fungal contamination was evaluated by direct plating for samples of clove, black and white peppers. Spread plate was used for the samples of rosemary, cinnamon, fennel, pepperoni pepper and oregano. Analyses were performed in triplicate in DG18 media with incubation at 25°C for 7days. The isolation and identification of fungi followed specific recommendations of culture media and incubation period for each genus. The presence of mycotoxins in spices was verified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to fluorescence. The frequency of species potentially toxigenic was high in white and black peppers with presence of both aflatoxigenic and ochratoxigenic fungi. Only rosemary and fennel showed contamination with aflatoxin B1 and there was a positive correlation (ρ<0.01) between the rosemary contamination with the presence of AFB1 and A. flavus. Even in the presence of ochratoxigenic fungi, ochratoxin A was not detected in the samples. The presence of natural components with antimicrobial activity could justify the low presence of mycotoxins, even in the presence of known toxigenic fungi in the samples.

In the present investigation, chemical composition and antifungal activities of thyme, cinnamon, rosemary and marjoram essential oils (EO), as well as synergism of their possible double and triple combinations were investigated. The compositions of the oils were determined by GC/MS. For determination of antifungal activity against Penicillium expansum and Botrytis cinerea, a broth microdilution method was used. The possible interactions of some essential oil combinations were performed by the two and three-dimensional checkerboard assay and isobologram construction. An in vivo antifungal assay was performed by artificial wounding of pear fruits. The maximum antifungal activity was demonstrated by thyme and cinnamon oils which displayed lower MIC values whereas rosemary and marjoram oils with MIC range between 2500 and 10,000μg/mL exhibited weak antifungal activities against tested fungi. In synergy testing, some double combinations (thyme/cinnamon, thyme/rosemary, cinnamon/rosemary) were found to be synergistic (FICi≤0.5).

Antioxidant activity was quantified relative to a dilution series of vitamin E analog standards (Trolox), which were analyzed in parallel simultaneously with the food and beverage samples. The antioxidant activities of the samples ranged from 131 to 131 000 micromole Trolox equivalents/100 g. Statistical analysis of the results showed that nine of the 11 matrixes gave acceptable HorRat values, indicating that the method performed well in these cases. The acceptable matrixes include pomegranate juice, blueberry juice, carrot juice, green tea, wine, rosemary spice, ready-to-eat cereal, and yogurt. Two samples failed the HorRat test: the first was an almond milk that had an antioxidant level below the practical LOQ for the method; the second was a sample of canola oil with added omega-3 fatty acid that was immiscible in the reaction medium.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D000975', 'D001628', 'D001713', 'D002839', 'D005504', 'D005638', 'D007202', 'D010851', 'D027861', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D013056', 'D017365', 'D013662', 'D014675', 'D014920', 'D015014']","['Antioxidants', 'Beverages', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Chromans', 'Food Analysis', 'Fruit', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Picrates', 'Prunus', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Spices', 'Tea', 'Vegetables', 'Wine', 'Yogurt']","Determination of antioxidant activity in foods and beverages by reaction with 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH): collaborative study First Action 2012.04.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23451369,2013

For comparison purposes, they were arranged in groups as C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, and Candida non-albicans. The essential oils were obtained from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Breyn, Lippia graveolens HBK, Ocimum basilicum L., Origanum vulgare L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Salvia officinalis L., Thymus vulgaris L., and Zingiber officinale. The susceptibility tests were based on the M27-A2 methodology. The chemical composition of the essential oils was obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and by retention indices. The results showed that cinnamon, Mexican oregano, oregano, thyme, and ginger essential oils have different levels of antifungal activity. Oregano and ginger essential oils were found to be the most and the least efficient, respectively. The main finding was that the susceptibilities of fluconazole-resistant C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, and Candida non-albicans to Mexican oregano, oregano, thyme, and ginger essential oils were higher than those of the fluconazole-susceptible yeasts (P<0.05). In contrast, fluconazole-resistant C. albicans and Candida non-albicans were less susceptible to cinnamon essential oil than their fluconazole-susceptible counterparts (P<0.05).

In the present study, the effect of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity on phytochemical stability of an ascorbic acid-fortified muscadine grape juice following high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing (400 and 550 MPa for 15 min) and after 21 d of storage at 25 degrees C was investigated. Addition of rosemary and thyme polyphenolic extracts (copigmentation) was evaluated as a means to stabilize anthocyanins and ascorbic acid during pressurization and subsequent storage. Polyphenolic extracts were partially purified in order to reduce their content of PPO substrates, and improve their stabilization properties within juice matrix. Overall PPO activity increased (3- and 2.5-fold) following HHP at 400 and 550 MPa, respectively, although it was significantly lower in copigmented treatments. Higher anthocyanin losses occurred at 400 (approximately 70%) than at 550 MPa (approximately 46%), which were correlated to antioxidant losses (r = 0.89). Similarly, greater ascorbic acid losses were observed at 400 (84%) than at 550 MPa (18%). Copigmentation increased anthocyanin retention in reference to pressurized controls (3- and 3.2-fold for rosemary and thyme treatments, respectively) and decreased ascorbic degradation (20 to 32%). In stored samples, higher anthocyanin content (>2-fold) and antioxidant capacity (>1.5-fold) was observed for copigmented treatments when compared to control juices.

The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) << MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase.

Also the overall appearance was checked, the identification of flavonoids was performed by color reactions and high-pressure liquid chromatography.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","['D002851', 'D002935', 'D000431', 'D020939', 'D006801', 'D020902', 'D027523', 'D028321', 'D027542']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum', 'Ethanol', 'Ginger', 'Humans', 'Hypericum', 'Lavandula', 'Plant Preparations', 'Rosmarinus']",[Development and analysis of revitalizing tincture].,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12532710,2003
11237177,"Rosemary and sage are common spices used in food. In our recent search of cancer chemopreventive agents from spices, the alcohol extracts of rosemary and sage showed strong antumorigenic activities. Rosemary and sage extracts contain active antioxidative factors such as phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids and phenolic acids. Here we discuss chromatographic methods used to separate and purify compounds from these spices and MS and NMR spectrometry to identify the isolated compounds. Several new compounds isolated from sage were determined to be 6-O-caffeoyl-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1)-beta-glucopyranoside, 1-O-caffeoyl-beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 1-O-p-hydroxybenzoyl-beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 1-O-(3-methyl-2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)-6-O-feruloyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 4-hydroxyacetophenone 4-O-[5-O-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoyl)-beta-D-apiofrunosyl]-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 1-O-[2-hydroxy-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenyl]-6-O-trans-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside.","BioFactors (Oxford, England)","['D000975', 'D004224', 'D005419', 'D019686', 'D019684', 'D008958', 'D015394', 'D010636', 'D017365']","['Antioxidants', 'Diterpenes', 'Flavonoids', 'Lamiaceae', 'Magnoliopsida', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phenols', 'Spices']",Chemistry and antioxidative factors in rosemary and sage.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11237177,2001
11087517,"Dehydrated chicken meat (a(w) = 0.20-0.35) made from mechanically deboned chicken necks can be protected against oxidative deterioration during storage by rosemary extract (at a sensory acceptable level of 1000 ppm, incorporated prior to drying). The efficiency of the rosemary extract was similar to that obtained by synthetic antioxidants in a reference product (70 ppm butylated hydroxyanisole and 70 ppm octyl gallate). Tea extract and coffee extract were less efficient than rosemary and synthetic antioxidants. Among the natural antioxidants tested, grape skin extract provided the least protection against oxidative changes in dehydrated chicken meat. Radicals in the product, quantified by direct measurement by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry, developed similarly to headspace ethane, pentane, and hexanal, and to oxygen depletion both in unprotected and protected products. The ESR signal intensity and headspace hexanal both correlated with the sensory descriptor ""rancidity"" as evaluated by a trained sensory panel. Hexanal, as a secondary lipid oxidation product, showed an exponential dependence on the level of radicals in the product in agreement with a chain reaction mechanism for autoxidation, and direct ESR measurement may be used in quality control of dehydrated food products.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D000975', 'D002083', 'D002645', 'D003890', 'D004578', 'D005227', 'D005519', 'D005707', 'D019686', 'D008460', 'D010936', 'D017392']","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Butylated Hydroxyanisole', 'Chickens', 'Desiccation', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Fatty Acids', 'Food Preservation', 'Gallic Acid', 'Lamiaceae', 'Meat', 'Plant Extracts', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances']",Protection of dehydrated chicken meat by natural antioxidants as evaluated by electron spin resonance spectrometry.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11087517,2001

7517069,"The multielement (Al, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Si, and Zn) levels of various common vegetables (bean, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, marrow, onion, parsnip, spinach, sprouts, sweet corn, and tomato); fruits (grape and strawberry); herbs (garlic, lemon balm, marjoram, mint, rosemary and tarragon); local pasture species and surface soils collected from a commercial garden centre located within a distance of 30 m of the London Orbital Motorway (M25) is presented. Comparative values are given from a background area, namely a domestic garden located in the North Yorkshire Dales National Park area. Analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quality control assessment using four international biological reference materials; BCR:CRM 62 Olive Leaves, NIST 1575 Pine Needles, NIST 1573 Tomato Leaves, and NIST 1572 Citrus Leaves. Inter-analytical method comparison is given using two methods of ICP-MS; namely conventional pneumatic nebulisation of sample solution, and direct solids analysis by laser ablation; and neutron activation analysis methods (NAA). For the elements listed there is a good precision obtained by ICP-MS and NAA. In particular levels of < +/- 1-10% (rsd) are obtained. Comparison of data with certified values and other analytical methods are generally of very good agreement. Lead levels in background areas ranged from 0.0008 to 0.340 microgram/g (fresh weight) for plant material; with the lead magnitude greater for grasses > herbs > vegetables > cereals > fruits. Measured values are in good agreement with reported literature values. The lowest Pb values are for marrow, lettuce, tomato and sweet corn samples (approximately 0.001-0.021 microgram/g). 'Green' leaf material levels were approximately 0.02-0.10 microgram/g (i.e. sprouts and cabbage). Root vegetables contain higher levels, approximately 0.02-0.125 microgram/g (especially carrot), reflecting possible metal uptake from soil. The highest vegetable Pb values are for leek and onion (approximately 0.35 microgram/g). Background values are also provided for nineteen elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Br, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Rb, Se, Sr, V, and Zn). Exposure to motor vehicle activities at a site some 30 m from the M25 shows only significant increases in Pb for unwashed plant material and surface soils. Typically Pb levels of 40-80% can be removed by washing plant surfaces resulting in metal levels similar to background areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",The Science of the total environment,"['D000393', 'D004784', 'D007854', 'D008131', 'D010945', 'D015203', 'D012989', 'D001335']","['Air Pollutants', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Lead', 'London', 'Plants, Edible', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Vehicle Emissions']",Metal dispersion and transportational activities using food crops as biomonitors.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7517069,1994
4019987,"To determine salicylate content, 333 food items were analyzed. Foods were homogenized with 25% sodium hydroxide, allowed to stand overnight, acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and then extracted with warm diethylether over 5 hours. The extract was dried and taken up in dilute sodium bicarbonate solution for analysis. Salicylic acid was separated by high performance liquid chromatography and quantified by reading at 235 nm. Salicylic acid standards were used throughout to standardize extractions and analyses. This is the most comprehensive set of data on food salicylates yet published; extraction appears to have been more complete for some foods, giving higher values than those previously published. Most fruits, especially berry fruits and dried fruits, contain salicylate. Vegetables show a wide range from 0 to 6 mg salicylate per 100 gm food (for gherkins). Some herbs and spices were found to contain very high amounts per 100 gm, e.g., curry powder, paprika, thyme, garam masala, and rosemary. Among beverages, tea provides substantial amounts of salicylate. Licorice and peppermint candies and some honeys contain salicylates.
