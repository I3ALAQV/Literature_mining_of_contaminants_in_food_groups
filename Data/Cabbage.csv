35243353,"Flubendiamide (FBD) is the first commercially available phthalic acid diamide that targets ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in insects, which play a major role in lepidoptera control. However, excessive use of FBD can influence the quality of treated products leading to toxic effects on human health. The availability of rapid and convenient methods for evaluating FBD amount in the environment is necessary. Therefore, analytical methods were developed for the determination of residues of FBD and its metabolite desiodo in different food matrices like tomato, cabbage, pigeon pea, apple, chilli and rice. The current review carries forward methods for FBD residues analysis in foods by using several chromatographic techniques including sample preparation steps. The comparison between the different methods employed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of food quality and safety is also discussed. Liquid chromatography (LC) is the predominant analytical method for assessing the quality of foods treated with FBD. Studies related to LC coupled multichannel detector (Ultraviolet (UV), Mass spectrometry (MS)) are also applied to detect pesticide residues. Extraction and clean up steps are essential to obtain reliable results. Moreover, this review reports the allowed limits of residues for the safety of consuming products treated with FBD.",Current research in food science,[],[],Extraction and determination of flubendiamide insecticide in food samples: A review.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35243353,2022
35217466,"More and more attention has been paid to the improved QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method in dealing complex sample matrices, especially for the study of QuEChERS adsorbents. In this study, a magnetic mesoporous material, which was derived from MIL-88B modified by l-alanine, was synthesized as modified QuEChERS adsorbents for the simultaneous determination of multiple pesticides (Methomyl, Isoprocarb, Carbofuran, 3-Hydroxycarbofuran, Acetamiprid, Imidacloprid) in Chinese cabbage, celery, long bean and leek. The prepared magnetic adsorbents can effectively remove interfering substances from the sample, and the proposed modified QuEChERS method can reduce sample pretreatment time via an external magnetic field. To achieve the best performance of QuEChERS method, the clean-up time and amount of QuEChERS adsorbents were investigated. Under the optimized conditions, a simple, rapid and sensitive method for the determination of 6 pesticide residues in vegetables was established by coupling the modified QuEChERS to ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

34904180,"The conducting polymer polypyrrole nanocones wrapped by metal cobalt (Co/PPy) are a promising platform for the detection of sodium nitrite, which can be obtained by an electrochemical deposition technique under a mild condition. Co/PPy nanocone arrays combined the high conductivity and large specific surface area of PPy nanocones with the redox properties of metal cobalt, and their 3D structure can provide more active sites for nitrite detection. Owing to the microstructure and excellent electrical properties of the nanocomposite, Co/PPy nanocone arrays were convenient to construct a high-performance nitrite sensor. The microscopic morphology and composition of Co/PPy nanocone arrays were characterized by SEM, FT-IR, XPS, and XRD, and their electrochemical performances were also investigated. The experimental results showed that Co/PPy nanocones exhibited excellent performance for nitrite determination. The sensors were used for the determination of nitrite in pickled Chinese cabbage and water samples, and the results were consistent with those of spectrophotometry.

34863503,"Dongbei Suancai (DBSC) - a Chinese cabbage-based sauerkraut is a traditional fermented food which is popular in Asian countries. The biogenic amines that are usually generated during spontaneous fermentation have raised public health concern, while inoculation technology may solve this problem. In the current research, the biogenic amines, as well as their interactions with the microbial community in DBSC inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum SC-5 or spontaneously fermented without inoculation were systematically investigated throughout 60 d fermentation. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the predominant biogenic amines in DBSC including putrescine, tyramine, spermidine, cadaverine and histamine increased during fermentation. Inoculated DBSC had a significantly lower content of total biogenic amines than the spontaneously fermented DBSC (216.72-237.33 mg/kg vs. 234.62-266.81 mg/kg) during 60 days' fermentation (P < 0.05). High throughput sequencing based on 16S rDNA identified 70 species in the bacterial community belonging to 7 genera of lactic acid bacteria, of which Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Lactococcus were dominant. Furthermore, six common genera of bacteria were positively correlated with biogenic amines based on Spearman's rank correlation test. Notably, the abundance of Lactobacillus plantarum SC-5 was negatively correlated with the content of biogenic amines in DBSC. In conclusion, inoculation of the proper starter like Lactobacillus plantarum SC-5 can reduce total biogenic amines in DBSC possibly by modifying the microbial communities in the fermented sauerkraut, which provides practical guidance for industrial production of high quality DBSC.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D001208', 'D001679', 'D002681', 'D048191', 'D007934']","['Asia', 'Biogenic Amines', 'China', 'Lactobacillus plantarum', 'Leuconostoc']",The interaction between Lactobacillus plantarum SC-5 and its biogenic amine formation with different salt concentrations in Chinese Dongbei Suancai.,"[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34863503,2021
34812004,"Carbamate pesticides are a class of synthetic pesticides having wide antimicrobial spectrum, good insecticidal efficacy, and a short residual period. These pesticides are used in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Their widespread use in the last two decades has led to the existence of drug residues in the environment, which are transferred to food, thereby raising concerns regarding the potential threat to human health. Rapid and accurate detection of carbamate pesticide residues in food is of great significance for food safety, and this requires pretreatment to purify the target components and maximize the accuracy and precision of the analysis.

Mass spectrometry analysis showed that Bra003466 was highly matched to protein 0305. Because the sequence of Bra003466 had 89% percent identity with ATG6 of Arabidopsis thaliana and other Brassica, the gene was named as BrATG6.

Sol-gel method was used to coat HC-POF on the glass stir bar. The prepared HC-POF coated stir bar shows better extraction performance for six triazole fungicides (TFs) compared to commercial polydimethylsiloxane and ethylene glycol-silicone coated stir bars. Fourier transform infrared Spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron Spectrometry were used to explore interactions between HC-POF coating and TFs.

Based on this fact, a new method of HC-POF coated stir bar sorptive extraction combined with high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector was developed for the determination of six TFs in grape and cabbage samples.

To visualize the degree of these discrepancies in each food matrix, we compiled a validation study based on a routine method developed in our laboratory, for 121 pesticides in six agricultural products, namely the grapefruit, potato, paprika, cabbage, spinach, and brown rice. These were analyzed by GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS, and the results were compared mainly on the basis of trueness. According to the results of the validation study when using GC-MS/MS, of the 121 pesticides tested in each product class, the number of analytes that satisfied the criteria of the Japanese validation guidelines was 97 in grapefruit, 111 in potato, 110 in paprika, 118 in cabbage, 111 in spinach, and 63 in brown rice.

In this study, the larvae were given three different diets-coconut cabbage, oil palm cabbage, and sago stem, under laboratory conditions for food consumption and developmental time experiment. The protein profiles of the digestive systems of the larvae fed on these three diets were also determined. Although the coconut diet was the most consumed by RPW larvae compared to oil palm and sago diets, the growth rate of RPW larvae on oil palm diet was however significantly shorter than those on the coconut and sago diets: the RPW only need 1 mo and 9 d to complete the larval duration.

This insecticide is misused and overused by farmers, and hence may pose health hazards to consumers. We monitored λ-cyhalothrin residues in lettuce and cabbage from farms at the market gates in Cotonou and Parakou using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis techniques. These residues were also monitored on samples directly from farms (on-farm sampling) for 14 days post-treatment. Potential factors such as photolysis and hydrolysis involved in λ-cyhalothrin degradation were also screened. Results revealed that the level of λ-cyhalothrin residue concentrations in lettuce from Houeyiho decreased from 4.2 mg/kg on Day 1 to about 0.2 mg/kg on Day 7. On Day 9, analyzed lettuces were all λ-cyhalothrin free. In contrast, even 14 days after treatment of cabbage from Bawera (Parakou), we still recorded the presence of λ-cyhalothrin residues in analyzed samples. For samples from market gates, λ-cyhalothrin residues were found in lettuce from two markets out of the nine surveyed in Cotonou. Interestingly, none of these contaminated samples had residues above the maximum residue limit for lettuce (MRL = 0.5 mg/kg). Similarly, in Parakou, samples from all five surveyed vegetable markets were contaminated with λ-cyhalothrin residues at concentrations below the MRL for cabbage (MRL = 0.2 mg/kg).

A 70% (v/v) ethanolic extract of red cabbage was concentrated to 9° Brix and further diluted (12 to 100%) in water. The dilutions were used as external standards for the building of PLS models. For the first time, this strategy was applied for building multivariate regression models. Reference analyses and spectral data were obtained from diluted extracts. The determinate properties were total and monomeric anthocyanins, total polyphenols and antioxidant capacity by ABTS (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonate)) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) methods. Ordered predictors selection (OPS) and genetic algorithm (GA) were used for feature selection before PLS regression (PLS-1). In addition, a PLS-2 regression was applied to all properties simultaneously. PLS-1 models provided more predictive models than did PLS-2 regression. PLS-OPS and PLS-GA models presented excellent prediction results with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.98. However, the best models were obtained using PLS and variable selection with the OPS algorithm and the models based on NIR spectra were considered more predictive for all properties.

29134675,"The category of 'leafy vegetables' comprises a wide range of plants, including cabbage, lettuce, leeks, spinach, Swiss chard and kale, and it forms a significant component of the human diet. Typically, leafy vegetables are low in calories and fat, are great sources of vitamins, protein, dietary fibre and minerals (including iron, calcium, and nitrates), and are rich in phytochemicals. To counter the impact of pests on vegetables, a broad variety of pesticides are used. Because of their large surface areas, leafy vegetables are expected to have high residual pesticide levels. As such, a sound analytical approach is needed to detect and quantify residue levels that are equal to or lower than the maximum residue limits, thus rendering the products safe for consumption. Overall, leafy vegetables consumed raw (after a tap water wash only), boiled or steamed contribute 2% of total vegetable consumption globally, and they might have a comparatively greater influence on health than cereal ingestion. Consequently, in this review paper, we highlight the importance of leafy vegetables, the pesticides that are commonly used on them and various analytical techniques, including sample preparation, extraction, clean-up and final detection. The effects on dissipation patterns, pre-harvest residue limits and safety/risks imposed by various pesticides are also reviewed and discussed. In conclusion, environmentally friendly extraction methods coupled with high-throughput techniques with greater reproducibility and lower uncertainty are needed for quantifying residues in leafy vegetables at very low concentrations.

Thus, consumption of contaminated food is the most important pathway for W mobility in this food chain. The highest concentrations of W compartmentalization were in the snail's hepatopancreas based on wet chemistry and synchrotron-based investigations. Chemical speciation via inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry showed a higher degree of polytungstate partitioning in the hepatopancreas relative to the rest of the body.

Obese rats were subsequently treated with different functional foods used for obesity management including pomegranate, grapefruit, and red cabbage in parallel to swimming exercise. Serum samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) followed by multivariate data analysis to classify samples and determine if such treatments can help revert obesity related metabolic changes back to normal status.

In this study, a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics approach targeting urine metabolism has been applied to assess the potential roles of functional foods and exercise for obesity management in rats. Male albino rats diagnosed as obese via histopathology and biochemical assays were administered functional foods in common use for obesity management including pomegranate, grapefruit, and red cabbage juice extracts in parallel with swimming exercise. Urine samples were collected from these rats, and likewise from healthy control animals, for metabolite analysis using (GC-MS) coupled to multivariate data analysis. The results revealed a significant elevation in oxalate and phosphate levels in obese rat urine concurrent with lower lactate levels as compared to the control group. Furthermore, and to pinpoint the bioactive agents in the administered functional foods, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) was employed for secondary metabolite profiling. The different phenolic classes found in the examined functional foods, viz. ellagitannins in pomegranate, flavanones in grapefruit and flavonols in red cabbage, are likely to mediate their anti-obesity effects.

Twenty-eight samples of the most common diet vegetables (red and white potato, onion, carrot, common bean, lettuce, and cabbage) were randomly bought at the market in September and October 2013. Using the atomic absorption spectrometry method, concentrations of nine heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were measured in the selected samples. The results showed that, in five out of 28 samples analysed, six concentrations exceeded the maximum levels provided for in the regulations: five for Pb and one for Cd. Maximum regulated levels for Pb were exceeded in two samples of red potato, two samples of common bean, and one sample of carrot (17.9 %), and for Cd in a sample of red potato (3.6 %).

27591592,"In this study, an aptamer-based fluorescent sensing platform using triple-helix molecular switch (THMS) was developed for the pesticide screening represented by acetamiprid. The THMS was composed of two tailored DNA probes: a label-free central target specific aptamer sequence flanked by two arm segments acting as a recognition probe; a hairpin-shaped structure oligonucleotide serving as a signal transduction probe (STP), labeled with a fluorophore and a quencher at the 3' and 5'-end, respectively. In the absence of acetamiprid, complementary bindings of two arm segments of the aptamers with the loop sequence of STP enforce the formation of THMS with the ""open"" configuration of STP, and the fluorescence of THMS is on. In the presence of target acetamiprid, the aptamer-target binding results in the formation of a structured aptamer/target complex, which disassembles the THMS and releases the STP. The free STP is folded to a stem loop structure, and the fluorescence is quenched. The quenched fluorescence intensity was proportional to the concentration of acetamiprid in the range from 100 to 1200nM, with the limit of detection (LOD) as low as 9.12nM. In addition, this THMS-based method has been successfully used to test and quantify acetamiprid in Chinese cabbage with satisfactory recoveries, and the results were in full agreement with those from LC-MS. The aptamer-based THMS presents distinct advantages, including high stability, remarkable sensitivity, and preservation of the affinity and specificity of the original aptamer. Most importantly, this strategy is convenient and generalizable by virtue of altering the aptamer sequence without changing the triple-helix structure. So, it is expected that this aptamer-based fluorescent assay could be extensively applied in the field of food safety inspection.

The procedure involved extraction of the rodenticides from samples with acetone, followed by liquid-liquid partitioning with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and 10% sodium chloride aqueous solution, then cleanup using GPC, and finally, analysis using LC-MS/MS. High recoveries from the GPC column were obtained for all rodenticides tested using a mobile phase of acetone/cyclohexane/triethylamine (400:1600:1, v/v/v). An ODS column, which contains low levels of metal impurities, gave satisfactory peak shapes for both hydroxycoumarin- and indandione-type rodenticides in the LC-MS/MS separation.

Of these, only AMS had a garlic-like odor whereas the other two metabolites were odorless. This demonstrates that the odor change in human milk is not related to a direct transfer of garlic odorants, as is currently believed, but rather derives from a single metabolite. The formation of these metabolites is not fully understood, but AMSO and AMSO₂ are most likely formed by the oxidation of AMS in the human body.

26985692,"Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized peptides with antimicrobial activity produced by numerous bacteria. A novel bacteriocin-producing strain, Lactobacillus plantarum JLA-9, isolated from Suan-Tsai, a traditional Chinese fermented cabbage, was screened and identified by its physiobiochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. A new bacteriocin, designated plantaricin JLA-9, was purified using butanol extraction, gel filtration, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The molecular mass of plantaricin JLA-9 was shown to be 1044 Da by MALDI-TOF-MS analyses. The amino acid sequence of plantaricin JLA-9 was predicted to be FWQKMSFA by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, which was confirmed by Edman degradation. This bacteriocin exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially Bacillus spp., high thermal stability (20 min, 121 °C), and narrow pH stability (pH 2.0-7.0). It was sensitive to α-chymotrypsin, pepsin, alkaline protease, and papain. The mode of action of this bacteriocin responsible for outgrowth inhibition of Bacillus cereus spores was studied. Plantaricin JLA-9 had no detectable effects on germination initiation over 1 h on monitoring the hydration, heat resistance, and 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) release of spores. Rather, germination initiation is a prerequisite for the action of plantaricin JLA-9. Plantaricin JLA-9 inhibited growth by preventing the establishment of oxidative metabolism and disrupting membrane integrity in germinating spores within 2 h. The results suggest that plantaricin JLA-9 has potential applications in the control of Bacillus spp. in the food industry.

26878720,"In vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) sampling method coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was employed to trace the uptake and elimination of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) in two kinds of edible plants, cabbage (Brassica parachinensis) and aloe (Barbadensis). The metabolism of fenthion in aloe was also investigated by the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS) to understand the fate of OPPs in living plants better. Transpiration stream concentration factor (TSCF) and depuration rate constants of the OPPs in living plants were obtained therein. The health risk of the OPPs treated aloe was estimated by the maximum residue limit (MRL) approach, and it revealed that the OPPs were rather safe for their fast degradable property. However, peak concentration of fenthion-sulfoxide was found to exceed the MRL and was higher than that of the parent fenthion, which indicated the potential risk of pesticide metabolites. This study highlighted the application of in vivo SPME for contaminant tracing in different living edible plants. The in vivo tracing method is very convenient and can provide more data to evaluate the risk of different pesticides, which are very important for the safety of agriculture production.

Our objectives were to determine the molar absorptivity (ε) of different red cabbage Cy-derivatives and to evaluate their spectral behaviors in acidified methanol (MeOH) and buffers pH 1-9. Major red cabbage anthocyanins were isolated using a semi-preparatory HPLC, dried and weighed. Pigments were dissolved in MeOH and diluted with either MeOH (0.1% HCl) or buffers to obtain final concentrations between 5×10(-5) and 1×10(-3) mol/L. Spectra were recorded and ε calculated using Lambert-Beer's law. The ε in acidified MeOH and buffer pH 1 ranged between ~16,000-30,000 and ~13,000-26,000 L/mol cm, respectively. Most pigments showed higher ε in pH 8 than pH 2, and lowest ε between pH 4 and 6. There were bathochromic shifts (81-105 nm) from pH 1 to 8 and hypsochromic shifts from pH 8 to 9 (2-19 nm).

The LC-QTOF-MS parameters, such as cone voltage, capillary voltage, collision energy and mass extraction window, were carefully optimised for the analysis of pesticide residues. The LC-QTOF-MS method was validated for 149 pesticides in four vegetables and fruits, i.e. apple, potato, cabbage and spinach, at a spiking level of 0.01 mg kg(-1). The samples were prepared according to the Japanese official multi-residue method with a modification to the column clean-up procedure. Of the 149 pesticides, recoveries in the range of 70-120% were achieved for 147 pesticides in apple, 145 in potato, 141 in cabbage and 131 in spinach, with intra-day precisions (RSDs) of < 25% and inter-day precisions (RSDs) of < 30%, which are within the acceptable range given in the Japanese method validation guideline. Matrix effects were negligible for the majority of the target pesticides. Except for spiroxamine in spinach, no interfering peaks were observed in the blank samples. The target pesticides, except those with low sensitivity, achieved calibration curves with satisfactory linearity, with correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.995 in the concentration range of 0.002-0.1 μg ml(-1). Furthermore, the majority of the target pesticides provided more than one fragment ion or isotope ion that could be used for confirmation.

26460365,"This paper describes a convenient and rapid fluorescence sensor for determination of paraquat (PA) based on glutathione-capped CdS quantum dots (QDs). The methodology enabled the use of a simple synthesis procedure for water solubilization of CdS QDs via a fast route using glutathione as a capping agent within 15 min. The resulting water-soluble QDs exhibit a strong fluorescence emission at 536 nm with high and reproducible photostability. PA is an important class of electron acceptors for QDs. Thus, the fluorescence intensity of the glutathione-capped CdS QDs probe could be dramatically quenched by PA due to the electron transfer mechanism. The fluorescence intensity of the CdS QDs system was proportional to PA concentration in the range of 0.025 to 1.5 μg mL(-1), with a detection limit of 0.01 μg mL(-1). The time of analysis sample, including preparation of QDs and fluorescent measurement for PA, was only 20 min. Most of the potentially coexisting substances did not interfere with the PA-induced quenching effect except diquat. Furthermore, the analytical applicability of the proposed method was demonstrated by analyzing PA in water, rice and cabbage samples, and the recoveries were between 86 and 105% which satisfied the requirement of detection for PA. These results showed that the proposed method was simple in design and fast in operation, and could be used as a sensitive tool for detecting PA in environmental and agricultural samples.

26317318,"Whey protein is a highly functional food ingredient used in a wide variety of applications. A large portion of fluid whey produced in the United States is derived from Cheddar cheese manufacture and contains annatto (norbixin), and therefore must be bleached. The objective of this study was to compare sensory and functionality differences between whey protein isolate (WPI) bleached by benzoyl peroxide (BP) or hydrogen peroxide (HP). HP and BP bleached WPI and unbleached controls were manufactured in triplicate. Descriptive sensory analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were conducted to determine flavor differences between treatments. Functionality differences were evaluated by measurement of foam stability, protein solubility, SDS-PAGE, and effect of NaCl concentration on gelation relative to an unbleached control. HP bleached WPI had higher concentrations of lipid oxidation and sulfur containing volatile compounds than both BP and unbleached WPI (P < 0.05). HP bleached WPI was characterized by high aroma intensity, cardboard, cabbage, and fatty flavors, while BP bleached WPI was differentiated by low bitter taste. Overrun and yield stress were not different among WPI (P < 0.05). Soluble protein loss at pH 4.6 of WPI decreased by bleaching with either hydrogen peroxide or benzoyl peroxide (P < 0.05), and the heat stability of WPI was also distinct among WPI (P < 0.05).

Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) was used to measure the concentration of cabbage volatiles during storage. The volatile levels of cabbage samples were measured at pH 3.3 to 7.4 at 4 °C for 14 d, and pH 3.3 at 25 °C for 5 d in order to determine the effect of pH and temperature. Aroma intensity, best aroma, freshness, and off odor were evaluated in a sensory test of the samples at 4 °C. The desirable volatile allyl isothiocyanate was lower in high pH samples (pH 7.4 and 6.4), whereas higher concentrations were detected in low pH samples (pH 3.3 and 4.6). Lipoxygenase volatiles, which produce a fresh green and leafy aroma in cabbage, were generated in very low amounts at any pH value. High pH samples generated significantly higher concentrations of off odors such as dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and methanethiol. Sensory tests showed that higher pH samples had significantly stronger off odor and lower desirable cabbage aroma than lower pH samples. Thus, sensory results matched the volatile results in that samples at higher pH levels formed the highest amount of undesirable volatiles and the least amount of desirable volatiles. Storage at 25 °C produced similar concentrations of allyl isothiocyanate, but significantly higher levels of off odors, than at 4 °C. Shredded cabbage products should be stored in low pH dressings to minimize formation of off odors and maximize formation of characteristic, desirable cabbage odor.

26041523,"A novel bare-eye based one-step signal amplified semi-quantitative immunochromatographic assay (SAS-ICA) was developed for detection of the pesticide imidacloprid. This method was based on competitive immunoreactions. Signal amplification was achieved by dual labeling of the test lines (TLs) on the strip using high affinity nanogold-biotinylated anti-imidacloprid mAb (BAb) and nanogold-streptavidin (Sa) probes. The relative color intensities of three TLs (TL-I, TL-II and TL-III) on a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane were used for direct visual analysis of the SAS-ICA strips, and could be used for semi-quantitation of analyte concentrations by observing what TLs disappeared in the amplification zone. Under optimized conditions, the following imidacloprid concentration ranges would be detected by visual examination of the SAS-ICA strip: 0-5ngmL(-1) (negative samples), and 5-25ngmL(-1), 25-250ngmL(-1), 250-1000ngmL(-1) and >1000ngmL(-1) (positive samples). The sensitivity (the visual detection limit (VDL) of TL-III) and semi-quantitative analytical capacity (when TL-III disappeared completely) of the SAS-ICA strip were 10-fold and 160-fold higher than those of traditional ICA, respectively. The developed SAS-ICA strip was applied to the analysis of spiked and authentic contaminated Chinese cabbage samples in the laboratory and under field conditions, and the results were validated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

26038320,"Malathion is an organophosphorous insecticide for controlling insects on fruits and vegetables, miscellaneous household insects, and animal parasites. It is important to develop highly efficient and selective pre-treatment method for analyzing malathion residues in environment and samples from agricultural products based on the molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). In this study, we developed a tailor-made MIP method with highly specific recognization to the template. The MIPs were prepared using malathion as a template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as a functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as a crosslinker, azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator, and the acetonitrile-chloroform (1:1, v/v) as a porogen. The molecular recognization mechanism of malathion and MAA was evaluated by molecular simulation, ultraviolet spectrometry (UV), and (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR). MAA interacted specifically with malathion by hydrogen bond with a ratio of 2:1. The MIPs exhibit a high affinity, recognition specificity, and efficient adsorption performance for malathion. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), surface area and porosimeter analyzer, thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyzer (TG/DTA) were used to characterize the properties of MIP. The malathion residues in soil, tap water, and cabbage were cleaned up by MIP-SPE, detected quantitatively using GC-FPD, and confirmed by GC-MS/MS.

Samples from kimchi were fermented at 4, 10, and 20 °C were analyzed by plating on differential and selective media, high-performance liquid chromatography, and high-throughput DNA sequencing of 16S rDNA. Nabak kimchi showed similar trends as dongchimi, with increasing lactic and acetic acids and decreasing pH for each temperature, but differences in microbiota were apparent. Interestingly, bacteria from the Proteobacterium phylum, including Enterobacteriaceae, decreased more rapidly during fermentation at 4 °C in nabak cabbage fermentations compared with dongchimi. Although changes for Proteobacterium and Enterobacteriaceae populations were similar during fermentation at 10 and 20 °C, the homolactic stage of fermentation did not develop for the 4 and 10 °C samples of both nabak and dongchimi during the experiment. These data show the differences in biochemistry and microbial ecology that can result from preparation method and fermentation conditions of the kimchi, which may impact safety (Enterobacteriaceae populations may include pathogenic bacteria) and quality (homolactic fermentation can be undesirable, if too much acid is produced) of the product.

It is considered a health drink in many countries because it is a rich source of vitamins and may have other health benefits. It has previously been reported that adding lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus) strains to kombucha can enhance its biological functions, but in that study only lactic acid bacteria isolated from kefir grains were tested. There are many other natural sources of lactic acid bacteria. In this study, we examined the effects of lactic acid bacteria from various fermented Vietnamese food sources (pickled cabbage, kefir and kombucha) on kombucha's three main biological functions: glucuronic acid production, antibacterial activity and antioxidant ability. Glucuronic acid production was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, antibacterial activity was assessed by the agar-well diffusion method and antioxidant ability was evaluated by determining the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity. Four strains of food-borne pathogenic bacteria were used in our antibacterial experiments: Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778. Our findings showed that lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from kefir are superior to those from other sources for improving glucuronic acid production and enhancing the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of kombucha.

The sample preparation procedure was carefully optimized for the efficient removal of co-extracted matrix components. The method involves extraction of acidic pesticides with acetonitrile containing hydrochloric acid, removal of water from crude extract by salting out, and sequential cleanup by octadecylsilyl silica gel and silica gel columns. For samples containing high amounts of pigments, such as spinach, additional cleanup using a graphitized carbon column was performed prior to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Recovery tests were performed for five times for each sample of cabbage, spinach, potato, eggplant, orange, and apple fortified at 0.01 mg kg-1.

The sample was cut into pieces and placed into a mixer cup containing half weight amount of 10% phosphoric acid in order to suppress degradation of easily degraded pesticides, represented by captan, and then homogenized. Pesticides in the phosphoric acid-treated sample were extracted with acetonitrile using a homogenizer, followed by salting out with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride. The extract was cleaned up on a C18 and graphite carbon black/PSA mini-cartridge column. Some pesticides gave tailing peaks, but these peaks became sharp and symmetrical when polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 was added to the test solution. Recovery tests were performed on nine kinds of agricultural products (brown rice, soybean, spinach, cabbage, potato, orange, apple, strawberry, and Japanese pear) fortified with 170 pesticides at 0.01 and 0.1 μg/g. Each concentration of pesticide residue was extracted from 2 samples on 5 separate days.

Finally, scanning electronic microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis was used to study PM-phyllosphere interactions. High quantities of Cd, Sb, Zn and Pb were taken up by the plant leaves. These levels depended on both the plant species and nature of the PM, highlighting the interest of acquiring data for different plants and sources of exposure in order to better identify and manage health risks. A maximum of 2% of the leaf surfaces were covered with the PM. However, particles appeared to be enriched in stomatal openings, with up to 12% of their area occupied.

The average recoveries were in the range of 90.29-95.00% with relative standard deviations ranging from 1.72% to 6.39%. The field results showed that pyridaben dissipated rapidly in cabbage and had a half-life of 2.8-3.5 d. During harvest, the terminal residues of pyridaben were 0.01-0.80 mg/kg. Given that no maximum residue limit (MRL) has been set for pyridaben in cabbage, risk assessment was evaluated by using the risk quotient (RQ). Results indicated that the RQ value was significantly lower than RQ = 1. Thus, the effect of pyridaben in cabbage at the recommended dosage was negligible to humans.

23886800,"Soil contaminated with cadmium presents a potential hazard for humans, animals and plants. The latter play a major role in the transfer of cadmium to the food chain. The uptake of cadmium and its accumulation by plants is dependent on various soil, plants and environmental factors. In order to identify soil properties with statistically significant influence on cadmium concentration in vegetables and to reduce the collection of data, time and costs, regression models can be applied. The main objective of this research was to develop regression models to predict the concentration of cadmium in 9-vegetable species: zucchini, tomato, cabbage, onion, potato, carrot, red beet, endive and chicory, based on soil properties. Soil samples were collected from 123 home gardens of the Municipality of Celje and 59 of these gardens were also included in vegetable sampling. The concentration of elements (e.g. arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc) in the samples was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Single (for cabbage, potato, red beet and chicory) and multiple (for tomato, onion, carrot and endive) linear regression models were developed. There was no statistically significant regression model for zucchini. The most significant parameter for the influencing the cadmium concentration in vegetables was the concentration of cadmium in soil. Other important soil properties were the content of organic matter, pH-value and the concentration of manganese. It was concluded that consuming carrots, red beets, endives, onions, potatoes and chicory which are grown in gardens with Cd concentrations (mgkg(-1) DW) above 2.4, 3.2, 6.3, 7.9, 8.3 and 10.9, respectively, might represent an important contribution to dietary Cd exposure.

It provides superior plant protection against a broad range of economically important lepidopterous pests, including Spodoptera exigua and Plutella xylostella. A determination method of flubendiamide in the cabbage was established in this paper. Flubendiamide in the cabbage was extracted with acetonitrile and ultrasonic extraction, and was purified by QuEChERS and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry). The results indicated that the average recovery of flubendiamide in the cabbage was 81.27%-91.45%, the coefficient of variation was 1.79%-4.81%, and the lowest detection concentration was 0.3 μg/kg. The extraction of flubendiamide from the cabbage and its analysis was in accordance with the pesticide residue criterion, i.e., simple, rapid, accurate, reproducible, stable, separatory, and convenient.

This indicated that the R-enantiomer was more toxic than S-enantiomer. The results of the degradation of racemate in Chinese cabbage and rape showed that the inactive S-(-)-enantiomer degraded faster than the active R-(+)-enantiomer. Inversely, we found a preferential degradation of the R-(+)-enantiomer in sugar beet. However, the degradation of malathion in paddy rice and wheat were nonenantioselectivity. In all plants, malathion was degraded to levels <10% after 5 days, and the calculated t(½) values of the enantiomers ranged from 0.83 to 1.43 days in these five plants.

However, the specificity and role of plant volatiles induced during the early phase of attack, i.e. egg deposition by herbivorous insects, and their consequences on insects of different trophic levels remain poorly explored. In olfactometer and wind tunnel set-ups, we investigated behavioural responses of a specialist cabbage butterfly (Pieris brassicae) and two of its parasitic wasps (Trichogramma brassicae and Cotesia glomerata) to volatiles of a wild crucifer (Brassica nigra) induced by oviposition of the specialist butterfly and an additional generalist moth (Mamestra brassicae). Gravid butterflies were repelled by volatiles from plants induced by cabbage white butterfly eggs, probably as a means of avoiding competition, whereas both parasitic wasp species were attracted. In contrast, volatiles from plants induced by eggs of the generalist moth did neither repel nor attract any of the tested community members. Analysis of the plant's volatile metabolomic profile by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the structure of the plant-egg interface by scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the plant responds differently to egg deposition by the two lepidopteran species.

Plants were grown in the greenhouse of a phytotron under controlled conditions in soils spiked with two different Zn or Cd concentrations. The measurements of Cd and Zn contents in soil and cabbage (leaf) samples were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy, whereas GLS levels in cabbage were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The ranges of metal contents in soil were 80 to 450 mg/kg dry weight for Zn and 0.3 to 30 mg/kg dry weight for Cd, whereas the levels of accumulated Zn and Cd in cabbage amounted to 15 to 130 and 0.02 to 3 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. After initial symptoms of toxicity, during a later stage of growth, the plants exhibited very good tolerance to both metals. Enhanced biosynthesis of GLS was observed in a dose-dependent manner following exposure to the heavy metals. The GLS content in Zn-exposed cabbage rose from 3.2 to 12 µmol/g dry weight, and the corresponding values for Cd-treated plants were 3.5 to 10 µmol/g dry weight. Thus, the increased soil contamination by metals caused greater accumulation in cabbage, as well as stimulation of GLS biosynthesis.

For products manufactured with starter cultures, it has been suggested that certain strains may produce higher amounts of such amines than others; however, to support efforts of food manufacturers in mitigating amine formation, reliable methods for amine quantitation are needed. Using 10 isotopically labeled biogenic amines as the internal standards, stable isotope dilution assays were developed for the quantitation of 12 biogenic amines and of the 2 polyamines, spermine and spermidine, in one LC-MS/MS run. Application of the method to several foods revealed high concentrations of, for example, tyramine and putrescine in salami and fermented cabbage, whereas histamine was highest in Parmesan cheese and fermented cabbage. On the other hand, ethanolamine was highest in red wine and Parmesan cheese.

An acetonitrile solution of (14)C-metofluthrin at 431 g ai ha(-1) was once applied topically to cabbage leaves at head-forming stage, and the plants were grown for up to 14 days. Each isomer of metofluthrin applied onto the leaf surface rapidly volatilized into the air and was scarcely translocated to the untreated portion. On the leaf surface, metofluthrin was primarily degraded through ozonolysis of the propenyl side chain to produce the secondary ozonide, which further decomposed to the corresponding aldehyde and carboxylic acid derivatives. In the leaf tissues, the 1R-trans-Z isomer was mainly metabolized to its dihydrodiol derivative probably via an epoxy intermediate followed by saccharide conjugation in parallel with the ester cleavage, whereas no specific metabolite was dominant for the 1R-trans-E isomer. Isomerization of metofluthrin at the cyclopropyl ring was negligible for both isomers. In this study, the chemical structure of each secondary ozonide derivative was fully elucidated by the various modes of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy together with cochromatography with the synthetic standard, and their cis/trans configuration was examined by the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) difference NMR spectrum.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001937', 'D003521', 'D005464', 'D005506', 'D007306', 'D007536']","['Brassica', 'Cyclopropanes', 'Fluorobenzenes', 'Food Contamination', 'Insecticides', 'Isomerism']",Metabolism of the insecticide metofluthrin in cabbage (Brassica oleracea).,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22224911,2012

Therefore, we examined to clarify the effects of kale on the pharmacokinetics of AA, its glucuronide (AA-G) and sulfate (AA-S). AA was orally administered to rats pre-treated with kale or cabbage (2000 mg/kg/day) for one week. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein, and the concentrations of AA, AA-G and AA-S were determined. In results, kale ingestion induced an increase in the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and a decrease in the clearance of AA, whereas cabbage had almost no influence. In addition, there were significant differences in the AUC of AA-G between the control and kale groups. mRNA expression levels of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, the enzymes involved in glucuronidation, in the kale group were significantly higher than those in the control group. In conclusion, kale ingestion increased the plasma concentrations of both AA and AA-G. The results suggest that kale ingestion accelerates the glucuronidation of AA, but an increase of plasma AA levels has a different cause than the cause of glucuronidation.","Biomedical research (Tokyo, Japan)","['D000082', 'D018712', 'D000818', 'D001483', 'D001937', 'D002853', 'D017931', 'D018565', 'D014453', 'D008297', 'D012333', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D060888']","['Acetaminophen', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Brassica', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'DNA Primers', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",Effects of kale ingestion on pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen in rats.,"['Q000097', 'Q000097', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None]","['blood', 'blood', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22199125,2012

Three isotopically labeled standards have been used as surrogates in order to improve accurate quantitation. Samples were extracted by using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) with ethyl acetate. In the case of spinach, an additional clean-up step by gel permeation chromatography was applied. Determination was performed by GC-MS/MS in electron ionization mode acquiring two MS/MS transitions for each analyte. The intensity ratio between quantitation transition (Q) and identification transition (q) was used as confirmatory parameter (Q/q ratio). Accuracy and precision were evaluated by means of recovery experiments in orange, nectarine, and spinach samples spiked at two concentration levels (0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg).

Seven vegetables were used: lettuce, carrots, chicory, collard greens, cauliflower, cabbage and tomatoes. Vitamin c analysis was made by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). After all manipulation stages, cumulative vitamin c loss was high in vegetables prepared in institutional restaurants and commercial restaurants corresponding to 44.38%-67.03% and 32.90%-71.32%, respectively. In both restaurants, storage accounted for the most expressive loss of vitamin c in the majority of the vegetables. The adoption of measurements to control vitamin c loss in vegetables is suggested, such as purchase and reception according to demand, storage at refrigerated temperatures, monitoring of hygiene and sanitation times, slicing near serving time, cooking preferably steamed, by pressure or stewed, monitoring of cooking time and temperature, and control of the exposure time between preparation and distribution.

26049232,"Chiral pesticide enantiomers often show different bioactivity and residual toxicity, but this property is usually ignored when evaluating the environmental risk and public safety. In this study, a convenient and precise chiral method was developed and validated for measuring fipronil enantiomers in Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis) based on a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using (R,R) Whelk-O 1 column. Then the proposed method was successfully applied to the study of enantioselective degradation of fipronil in Chinese cabbage under field conditions. The results showed that the degradation of the two enantiomers in Chinese cabbage was proved to be enantioselective and followed pseudo first-order kinetics (R(2)⩾0.98). The (R)-enantiomer degraded faster than the (S)-enantiomer, resulting in the relative enrichment of (S)-enantiomer in residue. The detected metabolites MB46513 (desthio), MB45950 (sulfide) and MB46136 (sulfone) by GC-MS suggested that degradation was mainly contributed by oxidization, reduction and photodegradation. Due to the more insecticide activity and lower mammalian toxicity of S-form, the higher concentration of S-fipronil may result in higher activity in crop protection and lower risk to environment and human beings compared to the recemate. This result should be considered in future environmental risk and food safety evaluation.

17995739,"Sauerkraut fermentations rely upon selection of naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria by addition of 2.0% to 2.25% granulated sodium chloride (NaCl) to shredded cabbage. Excess brine generated is a waste product with high levels of organic material (BOD) and nonbiodegradable NaCl. The objective was to determine whether addition of Leuconostoc mesenteroides starter culture to reduced-salt cabbage fermentations would yield sauerkraut with reproducible and acceptable chemical composition and sensory qualities. Shredded cabbage was salted with 0.5%, 1.0%, or 2.0% NaCl (wt/wt) at 2 starter culture levels, none or L. mesenteroides strain LA 81, ATCC 8293 (10(6) CFU/g). Fermentation products were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and pH was measured during the initial stages of fermentation and after 10 mo storage at 18 degrees C. A trained descriptive sensory panel used category scales to rate the flavor and texture of selected sauerkrauts. A modified Kramer shear test was used to measure firmness. Cabbage fermented with L. mesenteroides consistently resulted in sauerkraut with firm texture and reduced off-flavors across all salt levels (P < 0.05). Conversely, sauerkraut quality was highly variable, with softening and off-flavors occurring as salt concentrations were decreased in natural fermentations (P < 0.05). Fermentations were rapid, with a more uniform decline in pH when starter culture was added. L. mesenteroides addition to cabbage fermentations ensured that texture and flavor quality were retained, while allowing 50% NaCl reduction. Application of this technology to commercial sauerkraut production could improve the uniformity of fermentations and substantially reduce generation of nonbiodegradable chloride waste.",Journal of food science,"['D001937', 'D002851', 'D015169', 'D004305', 'D005285', 'D005511', 'D005516', 'D006863', 'D007934', 'D012965', 'D013696', 'D013997', 'D018505']","['Brassica', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fermentation', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leuconostoc', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Waste Management']",Effects of Leuconostoc mesenteroides starter culture on fermentation of cabbage with reduced salt concentrations.,"['Q000382', None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000494', None, None, None]","['microbiology', None, None, None, None, 'methods', None, None, 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17995739,2007
17852510,"Socio-economic changes that have taken place in Africa have influenced people's eating habits in both rural and urban set-ups. Most people prefer introduced foods to traditional foods, including plant foods whose consumption is widely regarded as a primitive culture manifesting poor lifestyles. However, recent studies on traditional plant foods have shown that some are highly nutritious; containing high levels of both vitamins and minerals. They also have potential as a remedy to counter food insecurity since most are well adapted to the local environment, enabling them to resist pests, drought and diseases. This paper describes the mineral (calcium, iron and zinc) contents in some 54 traditional vegetable species collected from Nyang'oma area of Bondo district, western Kenya. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the mineral content. We found that most traditional leafy vegetables, domesticated and wild, generally contain higher levels of calcium, iron and zinc compared with the introduced varieties such as spinach (Spanacia oleracea), kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata).

17628261,"Spinosad is an insect control agent that is derived from a naturally occurring soil bacterium, and is effective on several classes of insects, especially Lepidoptera larvae. Spinosad consists mainly of a mixture of spinosyns A and D and is registered for uses on a variety of crops in many countries including China. In order to understand the residue behavior of spinosad and to evaluate the dietary risk of spinosad residue in food in China, a number of residue studies were conducted on cotton, Chinese cabbage and eggplant. Residue detection methods using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection have been validated for the detection of spinosad and its metabolites in cotton, Chinese cabbage and eggplant. The proposed definition of the residue for the estimation of spinosad dietary intake is the sum of spinosyns A and D. According to existing Chinese residue studies, the Supervised Trials Median Residues (STMRs) for cotton seed, Chinese cabbage and eggplant were less than 0.010, 0.103 and 0.045 mg/kg, respectively. Daily intake of spinosad residue in food was calculated by multiplying the pertinent Chinese food consumption data with the STMRs. Establishment of spinosad acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0-0.02 mg/kg bw was based on a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 2.4 mg/kg bw per day and a 100-fold safety factor. Therefore, only 2% of the spinosad ADI is occupied by spinosad dietary daily intake in the Chinese population. The proposed maximum residue limits (MRLs) for spinosad on cotton seed, Chinese cabbage and eggplant are 0.01, 2 and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively. Although the STMRs for cotton and Chinese cabbage are lower or equal to STMRs used by Codex, no STMR for eggplant was used by Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) when dietary risk assessment was carried out for spinosad. If these Chinese residue studies were considered during the Codex risk assessment process, the International Estimate Daily Intakes (IEDIs) of spinosad in the five Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS) regional diets would be 2-30% of the ADI (0-0.02 mg/kg bw).

17562464,"With the public perception that synthetic pesticides leave harmful residues in crop produce for human consumption, there has been increased interest in using natural products for pest control. The potential of using fruit extracts of hot pepper for controlling the cabbage looper, Trichopulsia ni (Hübner) and spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch is explored in this investigation. Crude extracts from fruits of Capsicum chinense, C. frutescens, C. baccatum, and C. annuum, were prepared and tested under laboratory conditions for their insecticidal and acaricidal performance. Mortality was greatest (94%) when fruit extract of accession PI-593566 (C. annuum) was sprayed on larvae of the cabbage looper, while crude extracts of accessions PI-241675 (C. frutescens) and PI-310488 (C. annuum) were repellent to the spider mite. We investigated differences in chemical composition of the crude fruit extracts that may explain the observed differences in mortality and repellency between accessions. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry spectrometric analysis revealed that capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, the pungent components of pepper fruit, were not correlated with toxicity or repellency, indicating that the two capsaicinoids are not likely related to the efficacy of pepper fruit extracts. Major compounds in hot pepper fruit extracts were detected and identified as pentadecanoic acid methyl ester, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, and octadecanoic acid methyl ester. Spectrometric analysis and toxicity to cabbage looper larvae revealed that pentadecanoic acid methyl ester is likely related to cabbage looper mortality. However, the concentration of pentadecanoic acid methyl ester in some accessions was insufficient to explain the observed mortality of cabbage looper and repellency of spider mite. Fruit extracts of accessions PI-593566 (C. annuum) and PI-241675 (C. frutescens) could be useful for managing populations of cabbage loopers and spider mites, which could reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides.

Moreover, mitotic disturbances such as: c-metaphases, sticky and lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges, binucleate cells, micronuclei, ""budding"" nuclei and nucleoli partly outside nuclei were induced in the presence of the tested heavy metals, most frequently after Pb treatment. Pre-incubation in the ATH-rich extract from red cabbage leaves caused 2.5%, 1.8% or 1.6% increase in MI value as compared to the meristematic cells of A. cepa L. roots treated only with Cd, Pb, or Cr, respectively. Additionally, the ATH-rich extract was responsible for changing phase index values towards the control level in the material incubated in Pb or Cd. Moreover, the total number of mitotic abnormalities induced by the tested metals was reduced due to the preincubation in the ATH-rich extract, most effectively in the roots treated with Cd (by 2/3) while by half in Cr presence.

These associations are linked to dietary intake of glucosinolates and their metabolism to cancer preventive isothiocyanates. Bioavailability of glucosinolates and related isothiocyanates are influenced by storage and culinary processing of Brassica vegetables. In this work, the content of the 7 major glucosinolates in broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green cabbage and their stability under different storage and cooking conditions is examined. Glucosinolates and isothiocyanates were quantified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS). Isothiocyanates were detected with high sensitivity as the corresponding thiourea derivatives. Storage at ambient temperature and in a domestic refrigerator showed no significant difference and a minor loss (9-26%) of glucosinolate levels over 7 days. Vegetables shredded finely showed a marked decline of glucosinolate level with post-shredding dwell time - up to 75% over 6h. Glucosinolate losses were detected partly as isothiocyanates. Cooking by steaming, microwaving and stir-fry did not produce significant loss of glucosinolates whereas boiling showed significant losses by leaching into cooking water.

Pesticides were extracted from homogenized food samples with acetonitrile and decontaminated via the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) technique, using a primary secondary amine as sorbent prior to GPC-GC/MS analysis. A slightly modified preparation method and automated GPC step proved useful in minimizing matrix interference.

A low flow rate of 0.1 mL/min in GPC resulted in a 40-fold reduction in solvent consumption compared with conventional GPC column applications. The combination of MSPD technique and GPC-GC/MS for the analysis of the 97 pesticides can be accomplished within 90 min.

16718569,"Recognition of cabbage as a host plant for the diamondback moth (DBM) has previously been shown to depend on compounds that are extracted by soaking intact foliage in chloroform. Analysis of such chloroform extracts by open column chromatography has now resulted in the isolation of highly active fractions that elicit oviposition on treated filter papers. Further separation of these fractions by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of two distinct groups of active compounds that may be classified as volatile and non-volatile. The two prominent volatile components were separated and identified by mass spectrometry as the isothiocyanates, iberin (3-methylsulfinylpropyl isothiocyanate) and sulforaphane (4-methylsulfinyl-3-butenyl isothiocyanate). Subsequent bioassays of a range of isothiocyanates showed that iberin and sulforaphane were the most active of those tested. Other isothiocyanates with sulfur in the side chain were also active, whereas alkyl and phenyl isothiocyanates had only limited activity. In electrophysiological experiments, electroantennograms (EAGs) indicated positive responses of moth antennae to the isothiocyanates that were most active in behavioral assays. Since sulforaphane has been identified as a major inducer of anticarcinogenic activity in mouse tissue, a synthetic analog (exo-2-acetyl-5-isothiocyanatonorbornane) that shows similar inducer activity was tested on DBM. This bicyclic analog was highly active in both behavioral and EAG assays, suggesting similarity in receptor sites for the two types of biological activity.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000818', 'D001937', 'D004594', 'D005260', 'D017879', 'D008297', 'D009036', 'D010058']","['Animals', 'Brassica', 'Electrophysiology', 'Female', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Male', 'Moths', 'Oviposition']","Isothiocyanates stimulating oviposition by the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella.","[None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187']","[None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'pharmacology', None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16718569,2006

Residues of chlorfenapyr were extracted from soil and cabbage with acetone/water, purified by liquid/liquid partition and chromatographic column, concentrated to a small volume, and then determined by HPLC equipped with UV detector. The mean accuracy of analytical method were 93.3% and 90.6% in soil and cabbage, respectively; the precision (repeatability) in cabbage ranging from 1.7% to 11.8%, in soil ranging from 2.8% to 11.2%; the precision (reproducibility) in cabbage ranged from 2.2% to 12.1%, in soil it ranged from 2.4% to 11.5%. The minimum detectable amount of chlorfenapyr was 0.65 ng, the minimum detectable concentration was 0.0162 mg kg-1. The degradation of chlorfenapyr formulations in soil and cabbage was determined. The results showed that chlorfenapyr nanoformulation and suspension concentration degradation in soil coincided with C=0.2538 e-0.1612t, C=0.537 e-0.1754t, respectively; the half-lives were about 4.3 d and 3.9 d, respectively.

The degradation rate of chlorfenapyr nanoformulation was faster than that of suspension concentration, and the former residue was also less in soil. Therefore, a harvest interval should be more than 5 d, and a dosage of 900 mL/hm2 was suggested for chlorfenapyr suspension concentration, which could be considered as safe to human beings and animals.

Two types of Se-enriched shiitake obtained from selenite- or selenate-fertilized mushroom beds were used. More than 80% of Se in both shiitake samples could not be extracted with 0.2 M HCl. Protease digestion released a large amount of selenomethionine from the shiitake enriched with selenite. However, most of the Se in the shiitake enriched with selenate was not released by protease but was released by a cell wall digestive enzyme and most of the Se released was identified as selenate. These results indicate that the main Se species in the shiitake enriched with selenite or selenate is selenomethionine bound to protein or selenate bound to polysaccharides in the cell wall, respectively. Several Se-enriched vegetables grown on a soil fertilized with selenate were also analyzed by HPLC-ICPMS.

Of all of the 40+ vegetables, nuts, and grains screened, seven vegetables, one nut, and one grain were found to contain anthocyanins; the number of anthocyanins detected varied from two in pistachio nuts to 34 in red radishes. The individual anthocyanins were identified by comparing their mass spectrometric data and retention times with those of standards, published data, and reference food samples.

In paragenetic terms, three stages of mineralization are considered: ferro-arseniferous (quartz + arsenopyrite I + pyrite I + pyrrhotite + bismuth), zinciferous (sphalerite + chalcopyrite), and remobilization (arsenopyrite II + galena + gold). Due to the lack of laws and environmental education, Castromil is today a gold mining heritage site where we can detect the consequences of an incautious exploration (tailings, wells and adits located in the old explored zone) and where a residential area is located. In order to characterize the actual state of the old mining area the trace metal contamination of soils and waters by mining activities was investigated. In the studied area 106 soil samples, 15 waters and 20 plants were sampled and analysed. The soil samples were analysed for 32 elements by ICP-AES. Waters were analysed by ionic chromatography and ICP-MS for major and trace elements. Plants were analysed for As, Fe and Pb by AAS. The results are discussed taking into account the risk-based standards for soils and groundwater's (target and intervention values) proposed by Swartjes (1999). The results show elevated concentration of As and Pb which were found in soils collected from agricultural areas. Foodstuff plants species collected in the Castromil agricultural area show high concentrations of As in the leaves (cabbage and lettuce) and in the tubers (potatoes). Groundwaters in the mining area contain high concentrations of As that exceeds the intervention values. The area must to be subject to a remediation process, considering the actual risks to humans and ecosystems and the risks due to contaminant migration.",Environmental geochemistry and health,"['D004784', 'D005843', 'D019015', 'D006046', 'D008670', 'D008906', 'D010945', 'D011174', 'D018570', 'D012989', 'D014131', 'D014873']","['Environmental Monitoring', 'Geography', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Gold', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Plants, Edible', 'Portugal', 'Risk Assessment', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Trace Elements', 'Water Pollutants']",Site-specific characterization of Castromil Brownfield area related to gold mining activities.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000009', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'adverse effects', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15214610,2004
15204545,"A method for the determination of cadmium and lead in vegetables by stripping chronopotentiometric analysis, after digestion of the sample with concentrated sulphuric acid and dry-ashing, is described. Metal ions were concentrated as their amalgams on a glassy carbon-working electrode previously coated with a thin mercury film and then stripped by a suitable oxidant. Potential and time data were digitally derived and E was plotted versus dt/dE(-1), thus increasing both the sensitivity of the method and the resolution of the analysis. Quantitative analysis was carried out by the method of standard addition; good linearity was obtained in the range of examined concentrations, as was shown by the determination coefficients, which were 0.998 (n = 4) for cadmium and 0.993 (n = 4) for lead. Recoveries of 85-100% for cadmium and of 84-97% for lead were obtained from a sample spiked at different levels. Accuracy was demonstrated by analysis of a matching reference sample of cabbage. The detection limits were 1.8 ng g(-1) of wet mass for cadmium and 5.1 ng g(-1) of wet mass for lead. The relative standard deviations (mean of nine determinations), evaluated on a real sample, were 6.7 and 6.2%, respectively. Results obtained on 10 different commercial samples of pepper (Capsicum annuum), and egg plant (Solanum melongena) were not significantly different from those obtained by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry technique.

The nitrate () and nitrite () contents of various vegetables (Chinese cabbage, radish, lettuce, spinach, soybean sprouts, onion, pumpkin, green onion, cucumber, potato, carrot, garlic, green pepper, cabbage and Allium tuberosum Roth known as Crown daisy) are reported. Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables. The average nitrite contents in various vegetables were about 0.6 mg kg(-1), and the values were not significantly different among most vegetables. It was observed that nitrate contents in vegetables varied depending on the type of vegetables and were similar to those in vegetables grown in other countries. From the results of our studies and other information from foreign sources, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to establish limits of nitrates contents of vegetables cultivated in Korea due to the co-presence of beneficial elements such as ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol which are known to inhibit the formation of nitrosamine.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000490', 'D001530', 'D001937', 'D002212', 'D002852', 'D004032', 'D006801', 'D007391', 'D007723', 'D009566', 'D009573', 'D019697', 'D031224', 'D012621', 'D013025', 'D013056', 'D006113', 'D014675']","['Allium', 'Belgium', 'Brassica', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Diet', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Korea', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrites', 'Onions', 'Raphanus', 'Seasons', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'United Kingdom', 'Vegetables']",Survey of nitrate and nitrite contents of vegetables grown in Korea.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'adverse effects', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12888387,2003
12619774,"In the event of a nuclear incident it is essential that analytical information on the distribution and level of contamination is available. An ICP-MS method is described which can provide data on plutonium contamination in food within 3 h of sample receipt without compromising detection limits or accuracy relative to traditional counting methods. The method can also provide simultaneous determinations of americium and neptunium. Samples were prepared by HNO3 closed-vessel microwave digestion, evaporated to dryness and diluted into a mobile phase comprising 1.5 M HNO3 and 0.1 mM 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid. A commercially available polystyrene-divinylbenzene ion chromatography column provides on-line separation of 239Pu and 238U reducing the impact of the 238U1H interference. Oxidation of the sample using H2O2 ensures all Pu is in the Pu(+4) state. The oxidation also displaces Np away from the solvent front by changing the oxidation state from Np(+3) to Np(+4) and produces the insoluble Am(+4) ion. Simultaneous Pu, Am and Np analyses therefore require omission of the oxidation stage and some loss of Pu data quality. Analyses were performed using a magnetic sector ICP-MS (Finnigan MAT Element). The sample is introduced to the plasma via an ultrasonic nebuliser-desolvation unit (Cetac USN 6000AT+). This combination achieves an instrumental sensitivity of 238U > 2 x 10(7) cps/ppb and removes hydrogen from the sample gas, which also inhibits the formation of 238U1H. The net effect of the improved sample introduction conditions is to achieve detection levels for Pu of 0.020 pg g(-1) (4.6 x 10(-2) Bq kg(-1)) which is significantly below 1/10th of the most stringent EU (European Union) legislation, currently 0.436 pg g(-1) (1 Bq kg(-1)) set for baby food.

In this paper, bioavailability of added copper (Cu) and critical Cu concentrations in a vegetable garden soil was evaluated for Chinese cabbage (Brassica chinensis L.), pakchoi (Brassica chinensis L.), and celery (Apiumg graveolens L. var. dulce DC) based on human dietary toxicity. The availability of added Cu in the soil decreased with incubation time, and had minimal change after 10-12 weeks. After incubated for 12 weeks, about 60% of added Cu was not extractable by DTPA. The same crops were also grown in sand culture to determine their responses to solution Cu. Shoot growth was significantly inhibited at Cu concentrations above 10 mg kg(-1) in the solution or above 150 mg kg(-1) (DTPA-Cu) in the soil. The sensitivity of the crops to Cu toxicity differed among the three vegetable crops. Copper concentration in shoots and edible parts varied with Cu supply levels and type of the vegetables. Negative correlations (r=-0.90-0.99**) were noted between Cu concentration in shoots and fresh matter yields, but Cu concentrations in the edible parts were positively correlated with available and total Cu in the soil (r=0.91-0.99**). The critical tissue Cu concentrations at 10% shoot DM reduction were 19.4, 5.5, 30.9 mg kg(-1) for Chinese cabbage, pakchoi, and celery, respectively. Based on the threshold of human dietary toxicity for Cu (10 mg kg(-1)), the critical concentrations of total and available Cu in the soil were 430 and 269 mg kg(-1) for pakchoi, 608 and 313 mg kg(-1) for celery, and 835 and 339 mg kg(-1) for Chinese cabbage, respectively.","Journal of environmental science and health.

As part of a screening process, the growth of 15 cultures in a vegetable juice medium (VJM) was characterized by automated spectrophotometry. Acidification patterns as well as viability during storage of the LAB were also established. There were greater differences between the pure cultures than the mixed ones with respect to growth in VJM and viability during storage. Reductions in viable cell counts during storage of the fermented VJM occurred more rapidly with a Leuconostoc strain than for pediococci or lactobacilli. Inoculation of vegetables was carried out with cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum NK-312, Pediococcus acidilactici AFERM 772 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides BLAC which were rehydrated in a brine. This rehydration procedure was not detrimental to viability. During fermentation of a carrot/cabbage vegetable mix, sugar metabolism was characterized by the assimilation of both glucose and fructose, but sugars remained in the fermented vegetables when acidification stopped. The pH in the LAB-inoculated vegetables after 72 h at 20 degrees C was significantly lower (by 0.2 units) than the uninoculated control. Inoculation with LAB designed for silage fermentation resulted in the inhibition of acetic acid production, and reduced the production of ethanol during fermentation.

11170573,"Anthocyanin extracts are increasingly used as food ingredients. A current challenge is to maintain their color properties. The stability of some colorants has been studied in sugar and non-sugar drink models at three pH values (3, 4, and 5) under thermal and light conditions simulating rapid food aging. At a given pH, color stability mainly depends on the structures of anthocyanins and of colorless phenolic compounds. Colorants rich in acylated anthocyanins (purple carrot, red radish, and red cabbage) display great stability due to intramolecular copigmentation. The protection of red chromophore is higher for diacylated anthocyanins in red radish and red cabbage. For colorants without acylated anthocyanins (grape-marc, elderberry, black currant, and chokeberry), intermolecular copigmentation plays a key role in color protection. Colorants rich in flavonols and with the highest copigment/pigment ratio show a remarkable stability. By contrast, catechins appear to have a negative effect on red colorants, quickly turning yellowish in drink models. This effect is more pronounced when the pH is increased.

10993144,"The preventive effects of acylated anthocyanins from red cabbage on paraquat-induced oxidative stress were determined in rats. Decreased food intake and body weight gain, and increased lung weight and atherogenic index by feeding the rats on a diet containing paraquat were clearly suppressed by supplementing acylated anthocynins to the paraquat diet. Paraquat feeding increased the concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in liver lipids, and decreased the liver triacylglycerol level. These effects tended to be suppressed by supplementing acylated anthocynins to the paraquat diet. In addition, the catalase activity in the liver mitochondrial fraction was markedly decreased by feeding on the paraquat diet, this decrease being partially suppressed by supplementing the paraquat diet with acylated anthocyanins. An increase in the NADPH-cytochrome-P450-reductase activity in the liver microsome fraction by paraquat was suppressed by supplementing the paraquat diet with acylated anthocyanins. These results suggest that acylated anthocyanins from red cabbage acted preventively against the oxidative stress in vivo that may have been due to active oxygen species formed through the action of paraquat.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","['D000215', 'D000818', 'D000872', 'D001937', 'D002374', 'D002851', 'D002149', 'D050356', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D008956', 'D018384', 'D010269', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D017392', 'D015430']","['Acylation', 'Animals', 'Anthocyanins', 'Brassica', 'Catalase', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Energy Intake', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Paraquat', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances', 'Weight Gain']",Preventive effects of dietary cabbage acylated anthocyanins on paraquat-induced oxidative stress in rats.,"[None, None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, None, 'pharmacology', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10993144,2001

Another small (5-6 kDa) polypeptide was also separated, and purified to homogeneity. Mass spectroscopy yielded its molecular weight to be 5942 +/- 10. This polypeptide had an N-terminal sequence homologous to those of previously reported 5-kDa subunits from spinach and wheat and a 6.1-kDa subunit of Chlamydomonas, which had all been assigned to Photosystem II (PSII) and designated as PsbW. However, we found similar 5-kDa polypeptides with highly conserved N-terminal sequences ubiquitously in PSI particles from other plants including Daikon (Raphanus sativus, Japanese radish), Chingensai (Brassica parachinensis, Chinese cabbage), parsley and Shungiku (Chrysanthemum coronarium, Garland chrysanthemum) as well. Preparations of spinach PSI particles prepared by using a mild detergent (digitonin) had this 5-kDa subunit, while PSII particles did not. Moreover, a bare-bone PSI reaction center preparation consisting of PsaA/B alone had a more than stoichiometric amount of this 5-kDa polypeptide. A mechanically (without detergent) fractionated stroma thylakoid preparation from Phytolacca americana, which lacked other PSII subunits, also contained this 5-kDa subunit.

All the basic and other food items used in these calculations had been analysed by HPLC and about 170 of the items had been obtained and assayed in the UK. Recipe calculations took account of the cooking method and changes in water and fat content. Currently, approximately 1501 food items with Royal Society of Chemistry/Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food food codes have been allocated a vitamin K1 value, and a further 282 new recipe codes are included in the database. Representative values from each food group are reported together with an indication of the potential variation. Detailed examples of some recipe calculations are included, and also the impact of changing the type of fat in recipes. Vitamin K1 is associated with, and most abundant in, photosynthetic tissues of plants. Accordingly, the highest concentrations (3000-6000 micrograms/kg) are found in dark-green leafy vegetables and herbs, such as kale, parsley, spinach and green cabbage. Intermediate concentrations (1000-2000 micrograms/kg) are found in plants with paler leaves such as white cabbage and lettuce or in green, non-leafy vegetables such as broccoli and brussel sprouts. Fats and oils contain variable amounts of vitamin K1 with the highest concentrations (300-1300 micrograms/kg) in soyabean, rapeseed and olive oils and the margarines based on them. Other foods such as dairy products, meat dishes and cereal-based foods (bread, biscuits, cakes, desserts etc.), although not in themselves particularly rich in vitamin K1 (< 200 micrograms/kg), may contribute significantly to intakes when consumption of green vegetables is poor.

Some parameters have been estimated from the experimental data obtained in this work. The experimental data include the transfer factors of 137Cs from soil to the different vegetable species which are determined through high resolution gamma spectrometry, maximum crop biomasses for the vegetable species, the dry-to-fresh ratios for the vegetable species, the bulk density of soil layers and the average concentration of 137Cs in air. The derived parameters include the deposition rate and the root uptake rate, information for tillage, the logistic growth model and radionuclide concentrations in vegetables. The dynamic food chain model is solved by the Birchall-James algorithm to give the 137Cs concentration in subsurface soil, from the 0.1-25 cm soil layer, and the 137Cs concentration in harvested and unwashed vegetables. As validation of the model and parameters, the concentrations obtained experimentally and from the model are compared and are found to be in good agreement.","Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine","['D019661', 'D001937', 'D002588', 'D005507', 'D006723', 'D006801', 'D018545', 'D008962', 'D014675']","['Apiaceae', 'Brassica', 'Cesium Radioisotopes', 'Food Contamination, Radioactive', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Lettuce', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Vegetables']",Assessment of the transfer of 137Cs in three types of vegetables consumed in Hong Kong.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9745700,1998

Among 837 samples of 30 agricultural commodities tested, 43% contained residues above the detection limit for the method: 100% of broccoli samples; 80% of cabbage, kiwifruit, and grape samples; and 71% of cucumber samples. Most of the residues in kiwifruit were on or near the skin. Elimination of false-positive detections by the improved method was confirmed with kiwifruit in 2 independent procedures. Whole fruits were washed with 5% EDTA to remove surface residues of EBDC. Analysis of washes for CS2 by the headspace procedure after treatment with acidic stannous chloride and for ethylene thiourea by LC after prolonged treatment at 60 degrees C qualitatively identified the EDTA-soluble residues as EBDC. Although the improved method does not produce false-positive results, peak area responses of CS2 and the internal standard, thiophene, are influenced by chemical composition of the matrix.

In the present study, these important zinc compounds are further investigated. The determinations of the metal are performed by ET-AAS. The zinc complexes of all vegetables are anionic at pH 8.0 and show similar elution behaviour in gel permeation and anion exchange chromatography. Consequently, a great resemblance in structure between the low molecular weight zinc species from the different vegetables can be supposed. Exemplary, the zinc complexes of kohlrabi and Chinese cabbage are further examined. In more purified samples of these vegetables compared to zinc neither stoichiometric amounts of free protein amino acids nor nicotianamine, free malic acid, citric acid or phytic acid have been detected. Mainly glutamic acid is found in molar excess to zinc after acid hydrolysis in both cases. The cysteine contents of both zinc-binding fractions are very low. Conclusively, the well-known gamma-glutamylcysteinyl-glycines (phytochelatines) can not be responsible for the bonding of zinc in both ordinary vegetables.

Comparative values are given from a background area, namely a domestic garden located in the North Yorkshire Dales National Park area. Analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quality control assessment using four international biological reference materials; BCR:CRM 62 Olive Leaves, NIST 1575 Pine Needles, NIST 1573 Tomato Leaves, and NIST 1572 Citrus Leaves. Inter-analytical method comparison is given using two methods of ICP-MS; namely conventional pneumatic nebulisation of sample solution, and direct solids analysis by laser ablation; and neutron activation analysis methods (NAA). For the elements listed there is a good precision obtained by ICP-MS and NAA. In particular levels of < +/- 1-10% (rsd) are obtained. Comparison of data with certified values and other analytical methods are generally of very good agreement. Lead levels in background areas ranged from 0.0008 to 0.340 microgram/g (fresh weight) for plant material; with the lead magnitude greater for grasses > herbs > vegetables > cereals > fruits. Measured values are in good agreement with reported literature values. The lowest Pb values are for marrow, lettuce, tomato and sweet corn samples (approximately 0.001-0.021 microgram/g). 'Green' leaf material levels were approximately 0.02-0.10 microgram/g (i.e. sprouts and cabbage). Root vegetables contain higher levels, approximately 0.02-0.125 microgram/g (especially carrot), reflecting possible metal uptake from soil.

2592320,"AOAC official method 29.119-29.125 was revised to determine ethylenethiourea (ETU) directly by a liquid chromatographic-electrochemical (LC-EC) determinative technique and to improve ETU recovery. ETU is extracted from food products with a methanol-aqueous sodium acetate solution. A portion of the concentrated filtrate is added to a column of diatomaceous earth, and ETU is eluted with 2% methanol in methylene chloride to separate it from food coextractives, which are retained on the column. The eluate is collected in a siliconized flask and evaporated, the residue is dissolved in water, and 20 microL of solution is injected onto an LC graphitized carbon column. ETU is eluted from the LC column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-aqueous 0.1M phosphoric acid-water (5 + 25 + 70), and the eluted ETU is detected by using an amperometric electrochemical detector equipped with a gold/mercury working electrode. Recovery data were obtained by fortifying 13 food products with ETU: baked potatoes; canned applesauce, mushrooms, creamed spinach, green beans, spinach, and tomatoes; cooked fresh cabbage and frozen collards; fresh celery and lettuce; grape jelly; and powdered sugar cake donuts. Raw celery was found to cause low ETU recoveries. Average percent recoveries of ETU from the other 12 food products were 92 with a standard deviation of 12 for the low (0.05 and 0.1 ppm) fortification levels and 90 with a standard deviation of 6 for the higher (0.5 and 1 ppm) fortification levels.

Excellent agreement, with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.99, was observed in fresh potato samples homogenized with sulfite and allowed to react for different time intervals (enzymatic browning system). A good overall correlation was observed in dehydrated, sulfited apple samples heated for different times (nonenzymatic browning system); however, as heating time increased, higher results were obtained by the Monier-Williams method than by the alkali extraction/ion exclusion chromatographic method. The results of determining sulfite in the alkali trapping solution following acid distillation or acid treatment without heat suggested that this deviation was due to a fraction of sulfite bound to the browning reaction products in such a way that it was released by acid distillation but not by alkali extraction or acid treatment without heat. Similar behavior was demonstrated in cabbage with naturally occurring sulfite, which was released by acid distillation but not by alkali extraction or acid treatment without heat.
