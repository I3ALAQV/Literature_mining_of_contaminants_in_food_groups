34687751,"The levels of 12 trace metal (loid)s (TMs) in 10 vegetable types including leafy vegetables (purslane, purple basil and parsley) and fruiting vegetables (pepper, tomato, eggplant, cucumber, zucchini, green bean and melon) and in maize grown in Malatya province (Turkey) were investigated and non-carcinogenic health risks from consumption of these crops were assessed. The levels of TMs were measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The mean levels of Ni, Cu, Cd, Cr, As and Zn in all crops were below maximum permissible concentrations (MPCs), while those of Pb in pepper (0.109 mg/kg fw), eggplant (0.103 mg/kg fw) and green bean (0.177 mg/kg fw) slightly exceeded MPCs (0.1 mg/kg fw). Leafy vegetables had relatively higher concentrations of Al, As, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe and Mn compared to fruiting vegetables and maize. The estimated daily intake value of each TM estimated for each crop was found to be below the tolerable daily intake value. The target hazard quotients of all TMs in all crops did not exceed the acceptable non-carcinogenic risk level. However, hazard index (HI) value (1.57) in tomato was found to be above the threshold value of 1, indicating non-carcinogenic risks for consumers due to the intake of combined TMs in tomato. The THQ values of As, Co and Pb contributed 46.4%, 24.5% and 16.4% of the HI value of tomato, respectively. High daily consumption amount of tomato likely resulted in high HI value. The findings obtained in this study reveal that even if the levels of TMs in vegetables are safe, more attention should be paid to non-carcinogenic risks associated with TMs as a result of high vegetable intake.",Environmental research,"['D001151', 'D004784', 'D019216', 'D018570', 'D012989', 'D014675']","['Arsenic', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Vegetables']",Arsenic and trace metal concentrations in different vegetable types and assessment of health risks from their consumption.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34687751,2022
34497319,"Scientific investigations on levels of Organochlorine Pesticide (OCP) residues in plants largely consider the edible parts (crops, vegetables, and fruit plants). Though the non-edible parts of plants are not eaten by human beings directly, these parts are consumed by livestock and other animals, thereby facilitating the flow of chemical residues through the food chain. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the concentration of OCP residues in non-edible plant parts to provide insights on their potential ecotoxicological impacts. Eighteen OCP residues were extracted in nine different plant species (banana Musa acuminate, brinjal Solanum melongena, Casuarina equisetifolia, Eucalyptus globulus, lotus Nelumbo nucifera, paddy Oryza sativa, sugarcane Saccharum officinarum, tapioca Manihot esculenta, tomato Lycopersicon esculentum) following QuEChERS method. The concentrations of OCP residues in plant extracts were determined using Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The OCP residues, namely: γ-HCH (lindane), heptachlor epoxide isomer, dieldrin, endrin, endrin aldehyde and endrin ketone were found predominantly in seven plant species. Residues of γ-HCH (lindane) were reported in different parts of plant species such as stem (581.14 ng/g in paddy and 585.82 ng/g in tapioca) and leaf (583.3 ng/g in tomato). Seven samples contained residues of heptachlor epoxide isomer (512.53 to 1173.8 ng/g). Dieldrin was found in paddy stem (489.97 ng/g), tapioca stem (490.21 ng/g) and tapioca leaf (490.32 ng/g). The detected OCPs in the present study were 10-50 times higher than the Maximum Residue Limits (MRL, 0.01-0.1 mg/Kg) as prescribed in the Codex Alimentarius of the FAO/WHO. Their elevated concentrations in the plant parts therefore pose risk of contamination to the consumers in the food chain, including human beings those are dependent on the animals as source of protein. The findings of this study are the first report on residue levels of OCPs in non-edible plant parts in the agricultural landscape of Puducherry region, India. Since, this study assumes significance for the strategic location of Oussudu Lake, an interstate lake spread over Puducherry and Tamil Nadu states, regular monitoring of OCP residues in different environmental segments in strategic locations in both the states is suggested, which will help the authorities in devising a comprehensive environmental management plan aiming at the ecosystem at large.",Scientific reports,"['D000383', 'D017753', 'D054750', 'D004784', 'D005506', 'D006843', 'D010573', 'D010944']","['Agriculture', 'Ecosystem', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Food Contamination', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plants']",Organochlorine pesticide residues in plants and their possible ecotoxicological and agri food impacts.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497319,2021
33930769,"Understanding of pesticide persistence and diffusion on the fresh vegetables are extremely important in food safety and decontamination process. In this study, we examine the persistence and diffusion behaviour of chlorpyrifos pesticide in five different species of vegetables. The chlorpyrifos pesticide was spiked on the vegetable surfaces and the extracted samples from peel and tissues were subjected to Gas Chromatography equipped with a Flame Photometric Detector (GC-FPD). Further, the chlorpyrifos diffusion behaviour was compared with the osmotic potential, shear strength, cuticular chemical profile and microstructure of peel surface of vegetables. The persistence analysis results revealed that chlorpyrifos level was decreased in peel surface and diffusion rate was increased in inner tissue with respect to durations. Within 72 h exposure, chlorpyrifos reached 0.7 cm depth into the inner tissue of vegetables. Significant level of chlorpyrifos diffusion with P ≤ 0.05 was observed in beetroot (2.47%), khon khol (1.46%) and brinjal (0.92%) compared to cucumber and potato. Remarkably, there was no direct linkage between the chlorpyrifos diffusion rate, osmotic potential and toughness of vegetables. In addition, the Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses revealed that epicuticular surface microstructure and chemical profiles were not correlated with the chlorpyrifos diffusion in all the tested vegetables.

33094779,"The uncontrolled use of organophosphate (OP) group of pesticides has led to their accumulation in food and vegetables, causing major health issues. Hence, the development of a reliable sensor is imperative for the detection of neurotoxic organophosphates (OP). In the present study, we have intertwined the interfaces of a Metal Organic Framework (MOF), MOF-directed rapid electrochemically grown gold nanorods (aAuNR), cysteamine (Cys) functionalization, and the neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to fabricate a novel electrochemical bioprobe AChE/Cys/aAuNR/MOF/ITO for sensing OP pesticides with an ultra-low detection limit of 3 ng L-1 over a linear range of 30 to 600 ng L-1. Prior to sensing, in silico docking studies were employed for tracking the structural aspects of the molecular recognition of specific OP as potential inhibitors. The sensor can quantify residues of sprayed OP (chlorpyrifos, malathion, parathion, methyl parathion, ethion) in field vegetables (Abelmoschus esculentus, Solanum melongena, Capsicum annuum, Momordica charantia Linn) using a single calibration curve designed using chlorpyrifos, and the results were validated via gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) measurements. The inhibition rate kinetics of structurally different OP (chlorpyrifos, malathion, methyl parathion) were studied via the bioprobe and further validated using the standard Ellman method, confirming the practical applicability of the sensor for the detection of a specific group of OP.

32970426,"Pesticide residue analysis is critically important for ensuring food safety and regulating international trade. In a greenhouse setting, we assessed pesticide residue and exposure patterns using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and Allura Red tracer analysis. Our results show significant effects of eggplant canopy position and spray concentration on deposition parameters. Specifically, spray coverage, spray density, deposition, and residue were generally greater for leaves in the higher canopy. Deposition and residue, unlike spray coverage and spray density, linearly correlated with spray concentration. Pesticide residues on leaves linearly correlated with depositions on artificial targets, and a correction factor was constructed to estimate residues from tracer depositions. This comparative analysis suggests that tracer analysis using Allura Red in combination with artificial targets is a time- and cost-saving alternative to conventional residue analysis for assessing spray parameters under high-volume spraying scenarios. A better understanding of pesticide residue and spray patterns will not only enhance the safety of our food supply chain but also improve pest control efficacy within the sustainable integrated pest management framework.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000383', 'D005638', 'D010573', 'D018515', 'D032323']","['Agriculture', 'Fruit', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plant Leaves', 'Solanum melongena']",Assessing Pesticide Residue and Spray Deposition in Greenhouse Eggplant Canopies to Improve Residue Analysis.,"['Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970426,2021
32892012,"Fungicides have been extensively used around the world in agriculture due to their effectiveness of sterilization. Recent evidences have shown that fungicides would exert a negative effect on gut microbiota and result in gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolism disorder on non-target organisms and even humans. However, research on residues and potential health risks of fungicides in daily consumed vegetables has received less attention compared to insecticides. In this study, we studied three widely applied fungicides, procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin, in China. We collected 551 samples of 10 different vegetables in 11 cities from Zhejiang province during 2015-2017. Three fungicides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The average apparent recoveries of three fungicides ranged from 84.2% to 110% with the relative standard deviations lower than 10%. The LOD values of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin was 2, 0.09, and 1 μg/kg, respectively. The levels of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin in those vegetables ranged from ND-875, ND-238, and ND-76 μg/kg, respectively. The highest mean concentrations of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin were found in eggplant (68 μg/kg), spinach (16.4 μg/kg), and kidney bean (4 μg/kg), respectively. Tomato (62.6% of samples), eggplant (44.3% of samples), and cucumber (41.6% of samples) were most frequently detected with fungicides. Solanaceous fruit vegetables have the highest detection rate than other vegetables, and fungicides were most frequently detected in winter. The mean concentrations of three fungicides in different vegetables were all below the maximum residue limits for the national food safety standards of China, and the health risks resulting from consuming those vegetables in adults and children were all within the safe ranges.

28164808,"Although many allergens have been detected in eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), their identity have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether polyphenol oxidase (PPO), an important eggplant enzyme, acts as an allergen. The proteins of eggplant peel extract were separated on phenyl-Sepharose (PS), and analyzed by skin prick test (SPT), ELISA and IgE-immunoblotting; the components were analyzed for PPO activity, presence of protein-bound copper, and recognition by rabbit polyclonal anti-sweet potato PPO antiserum. LC-MS/MS and in silico analysis were employed to identify the separated allergens and prediction of IgE epitopes. Eggplant allergens were separated into 5 components (PS1-PS5), of which component PS2 exhibited high specific PPO activity. SPT and ELISA with PPO-rich pool (PS2) were positive in all 6 eggplant-allergic subjects; the 43, 64 and 71kDa proteins displayed strong IgE-binding ability. The 64 and 71kDa IgE-binding proteins show PPO activity, presence of copper, and recognition by anti-sweet potato PPO antiserum, clearly identifying them as PPOs; the 43kDa protein appears to be a degradation product of the 64 or 71kDa proteins based on enzymic activity and recognition by PPO antiserum. The 64kDa protein upon further resolution by SDS-PAGE displayed two components (identified as eggplant PPO1 and PPO4 by LC-MS/MS). Based on bioinformatics approaches, PPO4 has been identified as an allergen since it harbors an IgE epitope. This study clearly demonstrates that the 64 and 71kDa allergens in eggplant peel are PPOs based on enzymic activity and recognition by PPO antiserum; the 64kDa copper-containing protein is identified as one of the several eggplant allergens (Sola m PPO4).

27478901,"Soil contains various essential and nonessential elements, all of which can be absorbed by plants. Plant ionomics is the study of the accumulation of these elements (the ionome) in plants. The ionomic profile of a plant is affected by various factors, including species, variety, organ, and environment. In this study, we cultivated various vegetable crop species and cultivars under the same field conditions and analyzed the level of accumulation of each element in the edible and nonedible parts using ionomic techniques. The concentration of each element in the edible parts differed between species, which could be partly explained by differences in the types of edible organs (root, leaf, seed, and fruit). For example, the calcium concentration was lower in seeds and fruit than in other organs because of the higher dependency of calcium accumulation on xylem transfer. The concentration of several essential microelements and nonessential elements in the edible parts also varied greatly between cultivars of the same species, knowledge of which will help in the breeding of vegetables that are biofortified or contain lower concentrations of toxic elements. Comparison of the ionomes of the fruit and leaves of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and eggplant (S. melongena) indicated that cadmium and boron had higher levels of accumulation in eggplant fruit, likely because of their effective transport in the phloem. We also found that homologous elements that have been reported to share the same uptake/transport system often showed significant correlation only in a few families and that the slopes of these relationships differed between families. Therefore, these differences in the characteristics of mineral accumulation are likely to affect the ionomic profiles of different families.

The procedure involved extraction of the rodenticides from samples with acetone, followed by liquid-liquid partitioning with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and 10% sodium chloride aqueous solution, then cleanup using GPC, and finally, analysis using LC-MS/MS. High recoveries from the GPC column were obtained for all rodenticides tested using a mobile phase of acetone/cyclohexane/triethylamine (400:1600:1, v/v/v). An ODS column, which contains low levels of metal impurities, gave satisfactory peak shapes for both hydroxycoumarin- and indandione-type rodenticides in the LC-MS/MS separation. The average recoveries of rodenticides from eight agricultural foods (apple, eggplant, cabbage, orange, potato, tomato, brown rice, and soybean) fortified at 0.0005-0.001 mg/kg ranged from 76 to 116%, except for bromadiolone in orange (53%) and diphacinone in soybean (54%), and the relative standard deviations ranged from 1 to 16%.

In addition, the matrix effects were negligible for most of the rodenticide/food combinations.

25602148,"A sensitive and efficient method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of 73 multi-class acidic pesticides, such as phenoxy acid and sulfonylurea herbicides, in vegetables and fruits. The sample preparation procedure was carefully optimized for the efficient removal of co-extracted matrix components. The method involves extraction of acidic pesticides with acetonitrile containing hydrochloric acid, removal of water from crude extract by salting out, and sequential cleanup by octadecylsilyl silica gel and silica gel columns. For samples containing high amounts of pigments, such as spinach, additional cleanup using a graphitized carbon column was performed prior to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Recovery tests were performed for five times for each sample of cabbage, spinach, potato, eggplant, orange, and apple fortified at 0.01 mg kg-1. Out of the 73 tested pesticides, 70 for cabbage, 67 for spinach, 69 for potato, 67 for eggplant, 64 for orange, and 70 for apple were within the range of 70-120%, with relative standard deviations below 25%. Nitenpyram and pyrasulfotole showed low recoveries for all the samples tested, probably due to low recoveries from silica gel column. The developed method effectively removed co-extracted matrix components and was highly selective, with no interfering peaks found in the chromatograms of blank samples. The overall results indicate that the developed method is suitable for the quantitative analysis of acidic pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits.","Journal of environmental science and health.

Many (50%) of the samples contained pesticides, and three samples had residual levels above the maximum residue levels determined by the World Health Organisation. Three carbamates (carbaryl, carbofuran, and pirimicarb) and six organophosphates (phenthoate, diazinon, parathion, dimethoate, phosphamidon, and pirimiphos-methyl) were detected in eggplant samples; the highest carbofuran level detected was 1.86 mg/kg, while phenthoate was detected at 0.311 mg/kg. Gamma radiation decreased pesticide levels proportionately with increasing radiation doses. Diazinon, chlorpyrifos, and phosphamidon were reduced by 40-48%, 35-43%, and 30-45%, respectively, when a radiation strength of 0.5 kGy was utilized. However, when the radiation dose was increased to 1.0 kGy, the levels of the pesticides were reduced to 85-90%, 80-91%, and 90-95%, respectively.

The three herbicides were successfully separated and independently confirmed in a single run. Different extraction and cleanup methods were used to optimize the pretreatment processes of the residue analysis method. The final method is straightforward and involves extraction with 1% formic acid-acetonitrile, and no complicated cleanup process is needed. Determination of the compounds was achieved within 3.0 min. Respective average recoveries using this method at four concentration levels (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) ranged from 66.5 to 109.4%, with RSDs in the range of 1.1-19.7% (n = 5) for all analytes.

The method is based on the combination of coprecipitation of analyte ions by the aid of the Mo(VI)-diethyldithiocarbamate-(Mo(VI)-DDTC) precipitate and flame atomic absorption spectrometric determinations. The effects of experimental conditions like pH of the aqueous solution, amounts of DDTC and Mo(VI), standing time, centrifugation rate and time, sample volume, etc. and also the influences of some foreign ions were investigated in detail on the quantitative recoveries of the analyte ions. The preconcentration factors were found to be 150 for Pb(II), Zn(II) and Co(II), and 200 for Cd(II) ions.

20730643,"A rapid, simple and sensitive multi-residue method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 69 pesticides in fruit and vegetables using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The samples were extracted following the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method known as QuEChERS. Mass spectrometric conditions were individually optimised for each analyte in order to achieve maximum sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Using the developed chromatographic conditions, 69 pesticides can be separated in less than 17 min. Two selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays were used for each pesticide to obtain simultaneous quantification and identification in one run. With this method in SRM mode, more than 150 pesticides can be analysed and quantified, but their confirmation is not possible in all cases according to the European regulations on pesticide residues. Nine common representative matrices (zucchini, melon, cucumber, watermelon, tomato, garlic, eggplant, lettuce and pepper) were selected to investigate the effect of different matrices on recovery and precision. Mean recoveries ranged from 70% to 120%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20% for all the pesticides. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of more than 2000 vegetable samples from the extensive greenhouse cultivation in the province of Almeria, Spain, during one year. The methodology combines the advantages of both QuEChERS and LC-MS/MS producing a very rapid, sensitive, accurate and reliable procedure that can be applied in routine analytical laboratories. The method was validated and accredited according to UNE-EN-ISO/IEC 17025:2005 international standard (accreditation number 278/LE1027).","Food additives & contaminants.

(field mustard), Vigna unguiculata Walp. (cowpea), and Solanum melongena L. (eggplant) cultivated on land surrounding a plastic production factory were determined. The air DEHP concentrations (means) at the sites 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 km away from the plastic production building were about 9.4-12.8, 5.8-9.6, 1.6-5.0, and 0.04-0.27 microg m(-3) dry weight (DW), respectively. Wind direction is a key factor influencing the measurable DEHP concentration of the air, which was highest in the downwind direction and lowest in the upwind direction, and thus the vegetables accumulated the highest DEHP contents in the downwind direction and the lowest quantities in the upwind direction. The highest DEHP accumulations content of bok choy, field mustard, eggplant, and cowpea were 52.0 +/- 3.1, 43.1 +/- 2.2, 36.2 +/- 2.8, and 19.4 +/- 0.47 mg kg(-1) DW, respectively. Safety estimation on the basis of the daily intake limit referenced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) led to the conclusion that eating vegetables cultivated 0.2 km away from the plastic production building is not a food safety problem under normal conditions. A strong positive linear correlation between atmospheric DEHP concentration and DEHP content of the vegetable crops was found. The limits for air DEHP concentration for safe vegetable cultivation are 24.0, 34.8, 40.8, and 82.8 microg m(-3) for bok choy, field mustard, cowpea, and eggplant, respectively, by calculating from the equation of linear regression between air DEHP concentration and vegetable DEHP content.","Food additives & contaminants.

The residues of the insecticide were quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The mean initial deposits of indoxacarb on eggplant fruits were found to be 2.60-2.634 mg kg(-1) and 3.64-3.68 mg kg(-1) from the two rates of applications, respectively. They declined with time and reached to non-detectable (< 0.02 mg kg(-1)) after 15-20 d. Residues dissipated with a half-life of 3.0-3.8 d from both first and second-year application. A 3 d waiting period for harvest of fruits after insecticide application and processing resulted in the residue levels that were below the Codex maximum residue limit (MRL) of 0.5 mg kg(-1) thereby achieving a maximum safety and minimum risk to consumers. The best combination of chemicals for decontamination of indoxacarb was found to be by washing with a mixture of alkali and potassium permanganate (KMnO(4)) thereby resulting in the removal of 67.5% and 59.2 % residues for 5 and 10 microg g(-1) spiking doses, respectively. Major products formed on reaction of indoxacarb with alkali were identified by electron spray ionization chromatography/mass spectrometry (ESI/MS).

18622950,"Controversy exists regarding the possible protective role of carotenoids against cancer. Evidence is mainly against all-E-beta-carotene, while there is no evidence against other carotenoids or against mixtures of beta-carotene stereoisomers. Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets.

18553913,"Geometrical isomers of 2,4,6-nonatrienal have been reported from a variety of food- and insect-related sources. It was discovered recently that the eggplant flea beetle, Epitrix fuscula, uses the (2 E,4 E,6 Z) and (2 E,4 E,6 E) isomers as components of its male-produced aggregation pheromone. Here, we learned that the related species, E. hirtipennis, also emits a blend of 2,4,6-nonatrienals, including isomers not previously characterized. Patterns in emission and response suggest a pheromonal function. In an effort to acquire standards to aid in identification, we found that exposing (2 E,4 E,6 E)-2,4,6-nonatrienal (or other available 2,4,6-nonatrienals) to light readily generated a mixture of six geometrical isomers. Configurations of these were determined by NMR, and chromatographic properties (GC and HPLC) were documented. On the basis of chromatographic comparison to these standards, the most abundant, new compound from E. hirtipennis was concluded to be (2 E,4 Z,6 Z)-2,4,6-nonatrienal. Minor components from both E. hirtipennis and E. fuscula were also characterized.

Environmentally relevant concentrations of targeted compounds were detected for wastewater much higher than for groundwater. The overall distribution profiles of PAHs and PCBs appeared similar for groundwater and wastewater indicating common potential pollution sources. The concentrations of PAHs, PCBs and phenols for different soils ranged from 169.34 to 673.20 microg kg(-1), 0.04 to 73.86 microg kg(-1) and 73.83 to 8724.42 microg kg(-1), respectively.

17628261,"Spinosad is an insect control agent that is derived from a naturally occurring soil bacterium, and is effective on several classes of insects, especially Lepidoptera larvae. Spinosad consists mainly of a mixture of spinosyns A and D and is registered for uses on a variety of crops in many countries including China. In order to understand the residue behavior of spinosad and to evaluate the dietary risk of spinosad residue in food in China, a number of residue studies were conducted on cotton, Chinese cabbage and eggplant. Residue detection methods using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection have been validated for the detection of spinosad and its metabolites in cotton, Chinese cabbage and eggplant. The proposed definition of the residue for the estimation of spinosad dietary intake is the sum of spinosyns A and D. According to existing Chinese residue studies, the Supervised Trials Median Residues (STMRs) for cotton seed, Chinese cabbage and eggplant were less than 0.010, 0.103 and 0.045 mg/kg, respectively. Daily intake of spinosad residue in food was calculated by multiplying the pertinent Chinese food consumption data with the STMRs. Establishment of spinosad acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0-0.02 mg/kg bw was based on a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 2.4 mg/kg bw per day and a 100-fold safety factor. Therefore, only 2% of the spinosad ADI is occupied by spinosad dietary daily intake in the Chinese population. The proposed maximum residue limits (MRLs) for spinosad on cotton seed, Chinese cabbage and eggplant are 0.01, 2 and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively. Although the STMRs for cotton and Chinese cabbage are lower or equal to STMRs used by Codex, no STMR for eggplant was used by Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) when dietary risk assessment was carried out for spinosad. If these Chinese residue studies were considered during the Codex risk assessment process, the International Estimate Daily Intakes (IEDIs) of spinosad in the five Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS) regional diets would be 2-30% of the ADI (0-0.02 mg/kg bw).

According to HPLC-DAD-MS3 analyses the major anthocyanin in eggplant was delphinidin-3-rutinoside, while the predominant pigment in violet pepper was assigned to delphinidin-3-trans-coumaroylrutinoside-5-glucoside. Since virtually all anthocyanins were delphinidin-based, the effect of acylation and glycosylation patterns on colour stability and antioxidant capacity could be assessed. Application of two in vitro-assays for antioxidant capacity assessment revealed that eggplant generally exhibited higher values compared to violet pepper which was ascribed to 3,5-diglycosylated structures predominating in the latter. The higher extent of acylation in violet pepper was reflected by a more purplish colour shade of the extracts, but did not translate into a higher stability against fading which again was attributed to additional glycosyl substitution at C5. These findings support the relevance of structure-related activities of anthocyanins both for understanding food colour and their particular nutritional value.","Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

The results showed that the consumable safety time were found to be 10 days on sweet pepper and 14 days on hot pepper and eggplant fruits. The initial disappearance of profenofos appeared to follow first order kinetics with different rates of reaction of 0.38, 0.40 and 0.35 day(-1) for hot pepper, sweet pepper and eggplant, respectively. The corresponding half-lives (t1/2) were 1.84, 1.74 and 1.96 days.

The highest alpha-tocopherol content was in Sauropus androgynus leaves (426.8 mg/kg edible portion), followed by Citrus hystrix leaves (398.3 mg/kg), Calamus scipronum (193.8 mg/kg), starfruit leaves Averrhoa belimbi (168.3 mg/kg), red pepper Capsicum annum (155.4 mg/kg), local celery Apium graveolens (136.4 mg/kg), sweet potato shoots Ipomoea batatas (130.1 mg/kg), Pandanus odorus (131.5 mg/kg), Oenanthe javanica (146.8 mg/kg), black tea Camelia chinensis (183.3 mg/kg),papaya Carica papaya shoots (111.3 mg/kg), wolfberry leaves Lycium chinense (94.4 mg/kg), bird chili Capsicum frutescens leaves (95.4 mg/kg), drumstick Moringa oleifera leaves (90.0 mg/kg), green chili Capsicum annum (87 mg/kg), Allium fistulosum leaves (74.6 mg/kg), and bell pepper Capsicum annum (71.0 mg/kg). alpha-Tocopherol was not detected in Brassica oleracea, Phaeomeria speciosa, Pachyrrhizus speciosa, Pleurotus sajor-caju, and Solanum melongena.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002851', 'D010945', 'D014810']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Plants, Edible', 'Vitamin E']",Alpha-tocopherol content in 62 edible tropical plants.,"['Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11410015,2001
11394716,"Anthocyanins are a group of very efficient bioactive compounds that are widely distributed in plant food. Several fruits (blackcurrant, blackberry, red grape) and some vegetables (eggplant, onion, red radish) are rich sources of these natural pigments. Extracts of some of them are used as food colorants as well as components of pharmaceutical preparations and functional foods. Anthocyanins, through their ability to inhibit radical reactions, are considered to exert several protective effects in the human body. Until now there has been only a small amount of data available on their capability, in intact or metabolized form, to reach the systemic circulation of humans. The present study was designed to determine the potential bioavailability in humans of the most important anthocyanins of blackcurrants: delphinidine-3-glucoside, delphinidine-3-rutinoside, cyanidine-3-glucoside, and cyanidine-3-rutinoside. Urinary samples from 4 healthy volunteers (2 women and 2 men) were collected before (baseline) and over a period of 5 hours with intervals of 30 minutes after the ingestion of 200 mL of blackcurrant juice (containing 153 mg of anthocyanins). Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), it was possible to quantify the 4 main anthocyanins of blackcurrants, excreted unchanged in the urine (0.020-0.050% of the oral doses). We present data on the bioavailability in humans of blackcurrant anthocyanins, which are dietary antioxidants with possible biological effects.","Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer","['D000328', 'D000872', 'D001628', 'D001682', 'D002851', 'D005260', 'D005638', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D010936']","['Adult', 'Anthocyanins', 'Beverages', 'Biological Availability', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Plant Extracts']",Bioactive anthocyanins detected in human urine after ingestion of blackcurrant juice.,"[None, 'Q000652', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000493']","[None, 'urine', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'pharmacokinetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11394716,2001
7735459,"An effective multi-residue matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) extraction and gas chromatographic-electron-capture detection method for the determination of six synthetic pyrethroids (fenpropathrin, cyhalothrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate and deltamethrin) in 5 g of vegetables (West Indian gherkin, eggplant, pak-choi, cabbage and garden peas) is described. The method uses a Florisil-based MSPD column for direct in-line clean-up with n-hexane-acetone (9:1). Recoveries calculated at 0.1 and 0.5 micrograms/g fortification levels were between 92 and 113%. The method detection limits were between 5.1 and 91.5 ng/g. The method compared favourably with the traditional method in terms of the sample size, analysis time and overall cost. The method may serve as a screening protocol for the determination of pyrethroids in vegetables.",Journal of chromatography.
