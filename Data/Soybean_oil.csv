35161972,"As it is high in value, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is frequently blended with inferior vegetable oils. This study presents an optical method for determining the adulteration level of EVOO with soybean oil as well as peanut oil using LED-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. Eight LEDs with central wavelengths from ultra-violet (UV) to blue are tested to induce the fluorescence spectra of EVOO, peanut oil, and soybean oil, and the UV LED of 372 nm is selected for further detection. Samples are prepared by mixing olive oil with different volume fractions of peanut or soybean oil, and their fluorescence spectra are collected. Different pre-processing and regression methods are utilized to build the prediction model, and good linearity is obtained between the predicted and actual adulteration concentration. This result, accompanied by the non-destruction and no pre-treatment characteristics, proves that it is feasible to use LED-induced fluorescence spectroscopy as a way to investigate the EVOO adulteration level, and paves the way for building a hand-hold device that can be applied to real market conditions in the future.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","['D010367', 'D005506', 'D000069463', 'D010938', 'D013024', 'D013050']","['Arachis', 'Food Contamination', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Soybean Oil', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']","Quantitative Detection of Extra Virgin Olive Oil Adulteration, as Opposed to Peanut and Soybean Oil, Employing LED-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35161972,2022
34866108,"Oils and lipids are common food components and efficient sources of energy. Both the quantity and the quality of oils and lipids are important with regard to health and disease. Fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) is a novel lipid class that was discovered as an endogenous lipid; FAHFAs have shown anti-diabetic effects in a mammalian system. We analyzed the overall FAHFA composition in nut oils and other common oils: almond (raw, roasted), walnut, peanut, olive, palm, soybean, and rapeseed oils. We developed a method of liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) for a comprehensive target analysis of FAHFAs. The analysis revealed wide variation in the FAHFA profiles (15 compounds and 62 peaks). For 7-11 compounds of FAHFA, a total level of 8-29 pmol/mg oil was detected in nuts oils; for 11 compounds, 4.9 pmol/mg oil was detected in olive oil, and for 4-9 compounds, < 2 pmol/mg oil was detected in palm, soy, and rapeseed oils. The major FAHFAs were FAHFA 36:3, FAHFA 36:2, and FAHFA 36:4 in nut oil, FAHFA 36:2, FAHFA 34:1, and FAHFA 36:1 in olive oil, and FAHFA 32:1, FAHFA 34:0, FAHFA 36:0, and FAHFA 36:1 in all of the common oils. The composition of FAHFAs in nut oils is mainly unsaturated fatty acids, whereas those in olive oil are unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. The composition of FAHFAs in common oils was mainly saturated fats. This is the first report to demonstrate the quality and quantity of the FAHFAs in the nut oils.

34474871,"This study aimed to fabricate cinnamon essential oil (CO)-laden 45S5 bioactive glass (BG)/soy protein (SP) scaffolds exhibiting antioxidant and antibacterial activity. In this regard, 45S5 BG-based scaffolds were produced by the foam replica method, and subsequently the scaffolds were coated with various concentrations of CO (2.5, 5 and 7 (v/v) %) incorporated SP solution. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the CO-laden SP effectively attached to the 45S5 BG scaffold struts. The presence of 45S5 BG, SP and CO was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Compressive strength results indicated that SP based coatings improved the scaffolds' mechanical properties compared to uncoated BG scaffolds. The loading efficiency and releasing behaviour of the different CO concentrations were tested by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The results showed that CO incorporated scaffolds have controlled releasing behaviour over seven days. Furthermore, the coating on the scaffold surfaces slightly retarded, but it did not inhibit, the in vitro bioactivity of the scaffolds. Moreover, the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of CO was studied. The free radical scavenging activity measured by DPPH was 5 ± 1, 41 ± 3, 44 ± 1 and 43 ± 1 % for BGSP, CO2.5, CO5 and CO7, respectively. The antioxidant activity was thus enhanced by incorporating CO. Agar diffusion and colony counting results indicated that the incorporation of CO increased the antibacterial activity of scaffolds against S. aureus and E. coli. In addition, cytotoxicity of the scaffolds was investigated using MG-63 osteoblast-like cells. The results showed that the BG-SP scaffold was non-toxic under the investigated conditions, whereas dose-dependent toxicity was observed in CO-laden scaffolds. Considered together, the developed phytotherapeutic agent laden 45S5 BG-based scaffolds are promising for bone tissue engineering exhibiting capability to combat bone infections and to protect against oxidative stress damage.","Materials science & engineering.

In analytical food evaluation, oils represent an important field, allowing the exploration of the antioxidant effects of herbs and seeds. However, traditional methodologies have some drawbacks which must be overcome, such as being time-consuming, requiring sample preparation, the use of solvents/reagents, and the generation of toxic waste. The objective of this study is to evaluate the protective effect provided by plant-based substances (directly, or as extracts), including pumpkin seeds, poppy seeds, dehydrated goji berry, and Provençal herbs, against the oxidation of antioxidant-free soybean oil. Synthetic antioxidants tert-butylhydroquinone and butylated hydroxytoluene were also considered. The evaluation was made through thermal degradation of soybean oil at different temperatures, and near-infrared spectroscopy was employed in an n-way mode, coupled with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) to extract nontrivial information. The results for PARAFAC indicated that factor 1 shows oxidation product information, while factor 2 presents results regarding the antioxidant effect. The plant-based extract was more effective in improving the frying stability of soybean oil. It was also possible to observe that while the oxidation product concentration increased, the antioxidant concentration decreased as the temperature increased.

32930255,"Aflatoxins (AFs), as the secondary metabolites of the toxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, are well known to be extremely harmful to humans and animals because of their high toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity. Recurring and increasing studies on AF ingestion incidents indicate that AF contamination is a serious food safety issue worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, the IAC method may be limited to some laboratories because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) clean-up method based on humic acids (HAs), which is followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAs could be directly used as a DSPE sorbent after simple treatment without any chemical modification. In the HA-DSPE, AFs could remain on the HA sorbent by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was retained on HA via only hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix could be sufficiently washed off by n-hexane, whereas the AFs could still be retained on HA; thus, the selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices were achieved. Under the optimal conditions of HA-DSPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.3% to 106.2% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices i.e. blended oil, mixed olive oil, tea oil, sunflower seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, rice oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. Minor matrix effects ranging from 89.3% to 112.9% were obtained for the four AFs, which were acceptable. Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.063 and 0.102 μg kg-1 completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union (EU), China, or other countries. The proposed methodology was further validated using a naturally contaminated peanut oil, and the results indicated that the accuracy of the HA-DSPE could match the accuracy of the referenced IAC. In addition, HA-DSPE can be used to directly treat diluted edible oil without liquid-liquid extraction and HA is cheap and can be easily obtained from the market worldwide; these advantages make the proposed methodology simple, low-cost, and accessible for the determination of AFs in edible oils.",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,"['D000348', 'D001230', 'D001231', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004042', 'D005504', 'D006812', 'D010938', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Aflatoxins', 'Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Humic Substances', 'Plant Oils', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Facile dispersive solid-phase extraction based on humic acid for the determination of aflatoxins in various edible oils.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930255,2021

One technique to study whether foods contain allergens is targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) employing scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). However, the applicability of a single MRM method to many commercial foods is unknown as complex and heterogeneous interferences derived from the unique composition of each food matrix can hinder quantification of trace amounts of allergen contamination. We developed a freely available, open source software package MAtrix-Dependent Interference Correction (MADIC) to identify interference and applied it with a method targeting 14 allergens. Among 84 unique food products, we found patterns of allergen contamination such as wheat in grains, milk in chocolate-containing products, and soy in breads and corn flours. We also found additional instances of contamination in products with and without PAL as well as highly variable soy content in foods containing only soybean oil and/or soy lecithin.

30997934,"Protein isolates were recovered from scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) gonads to develop a novel functional matrix by investigating their physiochemical and functional properties. Scallop gonad protein isolates (SGPIs) were prepared from degreased scallop gonads (DSGs) by an alkali extraction and isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) process. The protein compositions of the SGPIs were mainly vitellogenin and beta-actin with molecular weights of 266 and 42 kDa, respectively, as determined using Nano-liquid chromatography-mass/mass (Nano-LC-MS/MS). After the ISP process, the protein solubility of the SGPIs was significantly improved, and the surface hydrophobicity of SGPIs intensely increased by 1.1-fold, which were attributed to the exposure of aromatic residues such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. However, the content of total/reactive sulfhydryl in SGPIs was decreased compared with that of DSGs. Meanwhile, the ISP process caused partial protein unfolding, as indicated by circular dichroism analysis, which exhibited a remarkable rise in the β-sheet content with a parallel decline in the α-helix and random coil contents (P < 0.05). SGPIs exhibited a better oil absorption capacity and foaming property than both DSGs and soybean protein isolates (SPIs). Moreover, the emulsifying capacity of SGPIs was greatly enhanced by the ISP process, which was superior to the effect of commercial SPIs and was ascribed to its favorable solubility as well as surface characteristics. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: During the processing of scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) adductors, scallop gonad, a high-protein part, is usually discarded as processing by-products despite its edibility. In recent years, scallop gonads are regarded as good sources to develop protein matrices due to their high protein content and numerous nutrients. In this study, scallop gonad protein isolates (SGPIs) were isolated by isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) process.

In this study, the fatty acid composition of peony seed oil and four less expensive edible oils (soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, and rapeseed oil) were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Peony oil adulterated by other edible oils was assessed using iodine values to estimate the extent of adulteration. Adulteration was also measured using an electronic nose (E-nose) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Results indicated that peony seed oil was highly enriched in α-linolenic acid. Although the iodine value can be used to detect some adulterants by measuring unsaturation, it was not able to detect all four potential adulterants. In contrast, the E-nose can rapidly identify adulterated peony seed oil by sampling vapor.

29624268,"Oils are important food ingredients, mainly as a source of unsaturated fatty acids. The offer of novel edible oils from herbs, spices and fruit seeds has grown and many of them are used as functional food and dietary supplements but also as feed additives in animal feeding. Poultry meat is recommended.in properly balanced diet and its consumption in Poland has been growing. The objective of present study was to verify if the supplementation of chickens' diet with grape seed oil or pomegranate seed oil influences cholesterol content and fatty acids (FA) profile in their livers. Ross 308 chickens (n = 24) were fed with fodder enriched with grape seed oil (G group) or pomegranate seed oil (P group). Diet of control group (C group) was based on soybean oil. FA analysis in livers as well as cholesterol content was made with gas chromatography. We observed significant increase in fat content when part of soybean oil was replaced by grape seed oil (p = 0.0002). Its highest amount was detected in G group (4.44 ± 1.53%) whereas the lowest in C group (1.73 ± 0.53%). Applied supplementation did not change total cholesterol content. Its content ranged from 233.0 ± 12.2 mg/100 g in G group to 234.6 ± 29.7 mg1100 g in C group. However, chickens' diet modification with grape seed oil and pomegranate seed oil influenced the FA profile in livers. We detected the presence of punicic acid (cis-9, trans-11, cis-13 C18:3, PA) in livers of chicken fed with pomegranate seed oil. Pomegranate seed oil is one of natural sources of conjugated linolenic acids (CLnA), which predominate in this oil (PA >70% of all FA). However, in livers PA constituted only 0.90 ± 0.10% of all fatty acids. Furthermore, we detected substantial amounts of rumenic acid (cis-9, trans-11 C18:2, RA) - the major isomer of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). Its natural sources in diet are meat and milk of ruminants, but incorporation of pomegranate seed oil into chickens' diet caused a significant increase of its share in fatty acids pool in their livers (3.73 ? 0.79% in P group in relation to 0.08 ± 0.03% in G group and 0.02 ± 0.00% in C group, p < 0.0001).

Potential differences in Se-metabolism were evaluated based on the total Se concentrations along with non-protein Se speciation patterns in the urine and blood serum of the rats. The total Se concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Se compounds in the samples were identified through high-performance liquid chromatography/ICP-MS. The total Se excretion rate was dose-dependent, and excess of dietary Se was eliminated in the form of Se-sugar 1, regardless of the administered Se-form. The excretion dynamics of dietary selenomethionine (soybean meal) and methylselenocysteine (Se-DRS) were different to that of the mineral Se (Se-salt). The proportions of Se species in the urine were significantly influenced by the Se source. A specific metabolic pathway, resulting in urinary excretion of Se-sugar 2, was observed in animals fed Se-DRS.

Complex multispecies adulteration is a commonly used strategy to mask the traditional adulteration detection methods. Most of the researchers were only concerned about single targeted adulterants, however, it was difficult to identify complex multispecies adulteration or untargeted adulterants. To detect adulteration of edible oil, identification of characteristic markers of adulterants was proposed to be an effective method, which could provide a solution for multispecies adulteration detection. In this study, a simple method of multispecies adulteration detection for camellia oil (adulterated with soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil) was developed by quantifying chemical markers including four isoflavones, trans-resveratrol and sinapic acid, which used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) combined with solid phase extraction (SPE). In commercial camellia oil, only two of them were detected of daidzin with the average content of 0.06 ng/g while other markers were absent. The developed method was highly sensitive as the limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.02 ng/mL to 0.16 ng/mL and the mean recoveries ranged from 79.7% to 113.5%, indicating that this method was reliable to detect potential characteristic markers in edible oils.

27988886,"Some naturally occurring cotton accessions contain commercially attractive seed oil fatty acid profiles. The likely causal factor for a high-oleate trait in pima cotton ( Gossypium barbadense ) accession GB-713 is described here. Vegetable oils are broadly used in the manufacture of many human and animal nutritional products, and in various industrial applications. Along with other well-known edible plant oils from soybean, corn, and canola, cottonseed oil is a valuable commodity. Cottonseed oil is a co-product derived from the processing of cottonseed fiber. In the past, it was used extensively in a variety of food applications. However, cottonseed oil has lost market share in recent years due to less than optimal ratios of the constituent fatty acids found in either traditional or partially hydrogenated oil. Increased awareness of the negative health consequences of dietary trans-fats, along with the public wariness associated with genetically modified organisms has created high demand for naturally occurring oil with high monounsaturate/polyunsaturate ratios. Here, we report the discovery of multiple exotic accessions of pima cotton that contain elevated seed oil oleate content. The genome of one such accession was sequenced, and a mutant candidate fatty acid desaturase-2 (FAD2-1D) gene was identified. The mutant protein produced significantly less linoleic acid in infiltrated Arabidopsis leaf assays, compared to a repaired version of the same enzyme. Identification of this gene provides a valuable resource. Development of markers associated with this mutant locus will be very useful in efforts to breed the high-oleate trait into agronomic fiber accessions of upland cotton.",Planta,"['D000483', 'D000595', 'D002849', 'D003369', 'D044943', 'D018506', 'D017343', 'D003368', 'D019787', 'D009154', 'D019301', 'D010802', 'D020871', 'D012333', 'D016415', 'D017422']","['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Cottonseed Oil', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Gossypium', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Mutation', 'Oleic Acid', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",Naturally occurring high oleic acid cottonseed oil: identification and functional analysis of a mutant allele of Gossypium barbadense fatty acid desaturase-2.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000201', 'Q000032', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None]","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'genetics', None, None, 'enzymology', 'analysis', 'genetics', 'metabolism', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27988886,2017

26964532,"The quality of chicken meat, which is one of the most widely consumed meats in the world, has been the subject of research and studies for many years. There are several ways to improve the quality of this type of meat, including changing the concentrations of individual molecular components. Such important components of meat are inter alia, cholesterol, vitamin E, and some fatty acids such as ω-3 and ω-6. Manipulation of ingredient levels may be achieved by enriching chicken feed with elements of different types such as vegetable oils, garlic, or selenium. Thus far, various biochemical and biophysical methods have been used to study quality of different meat types, especially broiler meat. Here, the authors demonstrate the use of high-resolution time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) mass spectrometry to assess how variations in animal nutrition affect concentrations of specific lipids in the meat, such as cholesterol and vitamin E. In the presented experiment, there were four different dietary treatments. Feed for animals in the first group was supplemented with soy oil in 50%, the second group's feed was supplemented with linseed oil in 50%, a combination of these two oils in the proportion of 44%:56% was used for the third group, and in the reference group, animals were fed with beef tallow. From each group, four individuals were selected for further analysis. Positive and negative ion mass spectra were generated from the pectoralis superficialis muscle tissue of the left carcass side of each one animal. Using TOF-SIMS with a bismuth cluster ion source (Bi3 (+)), and based on characteristic peaks for cholesterol in the positive mode and vitamin E in the negative mode, the authors have illustrated the relationship of these lipids levels to the various feeding regimens. Simultaneously, the authors characterized the varying dependences on the concentrations of measured lipids in fat and muscle fibers. The cholesterol concentration in muscle fibers was the lowest in the group fed with soybean oil and the highest in reference group IV (tallow feed). In the fatty region, the highest level of cholesterol was found in the third group. The highest concentrations of vitamin E were found in the fibers of the first group and the fat region of the second group. The obtained results show that SIMS imaging is a useful approach for assessing changes in lipid concentrations in the meat tissue from animals on different diets and provides a foundation for future research.

The results showed that relative amounts (RAs) of the most detected VAs were firstly increased to maximum values in oil samples collected at the second hour of the seventh day and the values were then decreased with the increase in the time of oil heating process (control). However, for food frying processes, the time needed for reaching maximum RAs of VAs was shorter and the values were decreased with the increase in frying time. Significant change in contents of the VAs was observed for oil samples fried with CBM due to the high contents of water, protein, and lipid content compared to oil samples fried with WD. Based on the obtained results, free radical reaction, particularly positional isomerization and cis-trans isomerization, was deduced to occur when WD or CBM was fried in SBO. The relatively high RAs of VAs formed during the deep-fat frying process presented certain invaluable measures for evaluating of frying oil and fried food quality and safety.

26070817,"In this investigation, off-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry using a single column has been applied for the identification and quantification of triacylglycerols in edible oils. A novel mixed-mode phenyl-hexyl chromatographic column was employed in this off-line two-dimensional separation system. The phenyl-hexyl column combined the features of traditional C18 and silver-ion columns, which could provide hydrophobic interactions with triacylglycerols under acetonitrile conditions and can offer π-π interactions with triacylglycerols under methanol conditions. When compared with traditional off-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography employing two different chromatographic columns (C18 and silver-ion column) and using elution solvents comprised of two phases (reversed-phase/normal-phase) for triacylglycerols separation, the novel off-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography using a single column can be achieved by simply altering the mobile phase between acetonitrile and methanol, which exhibited a much higher selectivity for the separation of triacylglycerols with great efficiency and rapid speed. In addition, an approach based on the use of response factor with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry has been developed for triacylglycerols quantification. Due to the differences between saturated and unsaturated acyl chains, the use of response factors significantly improves the quantitation of triacylglycerols. This two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system was successfully applied for the profiling of triacylglycerols in soybean oils, peanut oils and lord oils.

The results show that deep-frying methods generate more PAHs and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) (1.3 and 10.9 times, respectively) because they consume greater volumes of edible oil and involve higher oil temperatures relative to those of frying methods. In addition, the total B[a]Peq concentration of deep-frying is 2.2-fold larger than that of frying.

The concentration of marker compounds in vegetable oils were 0.08-1.47mgkg(-1) for daidzein, ND-78.9μgkg(-1) for daidzin, 0.40-5.89mgkg(-1) for genistein, 1.2-114.9μgkg(-1) for genistin, 3.1-85.0μgkg(-1) for trans-resveratrol and 1.9-51.0μgkg(-1) for cis-resveratrol, which are compatible with the raw materials for oil press. Additionally, the applicability of this method has been successfully tested in thirteen vegetable oils from the market. Mixed-mode SPE LC-MS/MS method can simultaneously detect isoflavones and resveratrols in vegetable oils and assess adulteration and quality of soybean and peanut oils.

25463210,"In most cases of mycotoxin detection, quantitation is critical while immunochromatographic strip tests are qualitative in nature. Moreover, the sensitivity of this technique is questioned. In order to overcome these limitations, an ultrasensitive and quantitative immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for rapid and sensitive quantitation of ochratoxin A (OTA) was developed. The assay was based on a competitive format and its sensitivity was improved by using a sensitive and selective OTA monoclonal antibody (OTA-mAb). The visible ICA results were obtained within 15 min, and in addition to visual examination, they were read by the rapid color intensity portable strip reader. The visual and computational detection limits (vLOD and cLOD, respectively) for ochratoxin A were 0.2 and 0.25 ng mL(-1), respectively. These values were lower than those reported by previous studies in a range 5-2500 folds. For validation, contaminated samples including wheat, maize, rice and soybean were assayed by ICA and a standard high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results were in good agreement for both ICA and HPLC methods. The average recoveries of the HPLC were in the range 72-120% while the ICA values were from 76 to 104%, confirming the accuracy and sensitivity of this method.","Journal of chromatography.

24016262,"With the wide application of plastics, the contamination of plasticizers migrating from plastic materials in the environment is becoming ubiquitous. The presence of phthalates, the major group of plasticizers, in edible items has gained increasingly more concern due to their endocrine disrupting property. In this study, 15 plasticizers in 21 edible vegetable oils purchased from a U.S. retail market were analyzed using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) were detected in all oil samples. Benzylbutyl phthalate (BzBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were detected at a rate of 95.2, 90.5, and 90.5%, respectively. The detection rates for all other plasticizers ranged from 0 to 57.1%. The content of total plasticizers in oil samples was determined to be 210-7558 μg/kg, which was comparable to the content range in oil marketed in Italy. Although no significant difference (p = 0.05) in the total content of plasticizer was observed among oil species (soybean, canola, corn, and olive), the wider range and higher average of total content of plasticizers in olive oil than other oil species indicated the inconsistence of plasticizer contamination in olive oil and a possible priority for quality monitoring. No significant difference (p = 0.05) in the total content of plasticizers was found among glass-bottle (n = 4), plastic-bottle (n = 14), and metal-can (n = 3) packaging, implying that oil packaging is not the major cause of plasticizer contamination. The daily intake amount of plasticizers contained in edible oil on this U.S. retail market constituted only a minimum percentage of reference dose established by US EPA, thus no obvious toxicological effect might be caused.

Rice proteins with molecular weights of 14-16, 26, 33, and 56 kDa have been identified as allergens. Recently, it was documented that the 56 kDa rice allergen was responsible for rice-induced anaphylaxis. The 14-16 kDa allergens have been identified as α-amylase inhibitors; the 26 kDa protein has been identified as α-globulin; and the 33 kDa protein has been identified as glyoxalase I. However, the identity of the 56 kDa rice allergen has not yet been determined. In this study, we demonstrate that serum from patients allergic to maize shows IgE binding to a 56 kDa protein that was present in both maize and rice but not in the oil seeds soybean and peanut. The 56 kDa IgE-binding protein was abundant in the rice endosperm. We have purified this protein from rice endosperm and demonstrated its reactivity to IgE antibodies from the serum of maize-allergic patients. The purified protein was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, resulting in identification of this rice allergen as granule-bound starch synthase, a product of the Waxy gene. Immunoblot analysis using protein extracts from a waxy mutant of rice revealed the absence of the 56 kDa IgE-binding protein. Our results demonstrate that the 56 kDa rice allergen is granule-bound starch synthase and raise the possibility of using waxy mutants of rice as a potential source of the hypoallergenic diet for patients sensitized to the 56 kDa rice allergen.

22969785,"Soybean (Glycinemax) is a hugely valuable soft commodity that generates tens of billions of dollars annually. This value is due in part to the balanced composition of the seed which is roughly 1:2:2 oil, starch, and protein by weight. In turn, the seeds have many uses with various derivatives appearing broadly in processed food products. As is true with many edible seeds, soybeans contain proteins that are anti-nutritional factors and allergens. Soybean, along with milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and wheat, elicit a majority of food allergy reactions in the United States. Soybean seed composition can be affected by breeding, and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture, insect/pathogen load, and/or soil nutrient levels). The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of genotype and environment on allergen and anti-nutritional proteins in soybean. To address genetic and environmental effects, four varieties of non-GM soybeans were grown in six geographically distinct regions of North America (Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Ontario, and Pennsylvania). Absolute quantification of proteins by mass spectrometry can be achieved with a technique called multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), during which signals from an endogenous protein are compared to those from a synthetic heavy-labeled internal standard. Using MRM, eight allergens were absolutely quantified for each variety in each environment. Statistical analyses show that for most allergens, the effects of environment far outweigh the differences between varieties brought about by breeding.",Frontiers in plant science,[],[],Environmental effects on allergen levels in commercially grown non-genetically modified soybeans: assessing variation across north america.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22969785,2012

The 68 PRs include 27 kinds of organophosphorus, 23 organic chlorines, 11 synthetic pyrethroids, and 7 carbamates. Heptachlor epoxide was used as the internal standard. Aminopropyl silica was chosen as the dispersion sorbent of the oil-absorbing matrix solid-phase dispersion extraction and was applied to capture hydrophobic components from high oil samples. A 35-min orthogonal separation was performed by using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry with a nonpolar-polar column set. Identification of 68 PRs in the extract was finished by using the time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the assistance of an automated peak-find and spectral deconvolution software.

22417487,"Reportedly policosanols (PCs) have various beneficial functionalities on health. A gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) with a low limit of detection (LOD), and high specificity, recovery, and precision was successfully established for the PC analysis in vegetable oils. The LODs for the PCs were in the range of 0.002 to 0.016 μg/mL. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for the repeated analysis of PCs was less than 3.356%. The mean recoveries for spiked heptacosanol and octacosanol in vegetable oil were 102.3% and 106.3%, respectively. The total PC contents in the vegetable oils varied from 3.01 to 427.83 mg/kg oil. Perilla seed, grape seed, and rice bran oils were found to be highly rich sources of PCs, containing 427.83, 245.15, and 171.17 mg PCs/kg oil, respectively. Corn, sesame, and soybean oils contained only a negligible quantity of PCs. The PC composition in vegetable oils was greatly source dependent. In perilla seed oil, octacosanol was the single most predominant component, representing 55.93% of the total PC. In grape seed oil, however, hexacosanol is the most abundant PC, followed by octacosanol, tetracosanol, and triacontanol in a decreasing order. The major PCs in rice bran oil were triacontanol, octacosanol, hexacosanol, and tetracosanol, which constituted over 87.3% of the total PC.

The present study investigated the effects of a diet containing thermally oxidized soybean oil (TO) or TO supplemented with probiotic Bifidobacteria (TO+Pro) on the serum lipid profile and oxidative stress biomarkers of male rats. The data showed several indicators of oil deterioration after thermal processing, including high levels of % free fatty acid (FFA; 15-fold), acid value (AV; 14-fold), peroxide value (8-fold), p-anisidine value (AnV; 39-fold), total oxidation value (TOTOX; 19-fold), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) value (8.5-fold), and trans-FA (TFA) isomers (2.5-fold) compared to the control. The rats that were fed a diet containing TO showed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in body weight gain, food efficiency values, and liver weight. Furthermore, the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were increased, while the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level was decreased in blood serum samples. High levels of TBARS, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were also detected in the livers, kidneys, testes, and brains of rats. Interestingly, a diet containing TO+Pro restored all biological parameters to their control values.

Like soybean (Glycine max) and pea (Pisum sativum), Lotus develops straight seed pods and each pod contains approximately 20 seeds that reach maturity within 40 days. Histological sections show the characteristic three developmental phases of legume seeds and the presence of embryo, endosperm, and seed coat in desiccated seeds. Furthermore, protein, oil, starch, phytic acid, and ash contents were determined, and this indicates that the composition of mature Lotus seed is more similar to soybean than to pea. In a first attempt to determine the seed proteome, both a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis approach and a gel-based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach were used. Globulins were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and five legumins, LLP1 to LLP5, and two convicilins, LCP1 and LCP2, were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. For two distinct developmental phases, seed filling and desiccation, a gel-based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach was used, and 665 and 181 unique proteins corresponding to gene accession numbers were identified for the two phases, respectively.

These materials are currently disposed of in landfills and could potentially have a negative impact on the effective function of microbes that are intolerant of acidic conditions. A study was undertaken using three different sources of acid waste bentonites, namely soybean oil bentonite (SB), palm oil bentonite (PB), and rice bran oil bentonite (RB). These materials were co-composted with rice husk, rice husk ash, and chicken litter to eliminate their acid reactivity and hydrophobic nature. The organic carbon (OC) content, pH, exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the acid-activated bentonites increased significantly after the co-composting phase. In addition, the hydrophobic nature of these materials as measured using the water drop penetration time (WDPT) decreased from >10 800 s to 16 to 80 s after composting. Furthermore, these composted materials showed positive impacts on soil physical attributes including specific surface area, bulk density, and available water content for crop growth. Highly significant increases in maize biomass (Zea mays L.) production over two consecutive cropping cycles was observed in treatments receiving co-composted bentonite.

16998985,"In microwave popcorn workers, exposure to butter flavorings has been associated with fixed obstructive lung disease resembling bronchiolitis obliterans. Inhalation toxicology studies have shown severe respiratory effects in rats exposed to vapors from a paste butter flavoring, and to diacetyl, a diketone found in most butter flavorings. To gain a better understanding of worker exposures, we assessed diacetyl emissions and airborne dust levels from butter flavorings used by several microwave popcorn manufacturing companies. We heated bulk samples of 40 different butter flavorings (liquids, pastes, and powders) to approximately 50 degrees C and used gas chromatography, with a mass selective detector, to measure the relative abundance of volatile organic compounds emitted. Air sampling was conducted for diacetyl and for total and respirable dust during the mixing of powder, liquid, or paste flavorings with heated soybean oil at a microwave popcorn plant. To further examine the potential for respiratory exposures to powders, we measured dust generated during different simulated methods of manual handling of several powder butter flavorings. Powder flavorings were found to give off much lower diacetyl emissions than pastes or liquids. The mean diacetyl emissions from liquids and pastes were 64 and 26 times larger, respectively, than the mean of diacetyl emissions from powders. The median diacetyl emissions from liquids and pastes were 364 and 72 times larger, respectively, than the median of diacetyl emissions from powders. Fourteen of 16 powders had diacetyl emissions that were lower than the diacetyl emissions from any liquid flavoring and from most paste flavorings. However, simulated handling of powder flavorings showed that a substantial amount of the airborne dust generated was of respirable size and could thus pose its own respiratory hazard. Companies that use butter flavorings should consider substituting flavorings with lower diacetyl emissions and the use of ventilation and enclosure engineering controls to minimize exposures. Until controls are fully implemented, companies should institute mandatory respiratory protection for all exposed workers.",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,"['D000395', 'D002079', 'D002849', 'D003931', 'D004391', 'D005421', 'D005525', 'D008872', 'D016273', 'D010316']","['Air Pollutants, Occupational', 'Butter', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Diacetyl', 'Dust', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Food-Processing Industry', 'Microwaves', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Particle Size']",Diacetyl emissions and airborne dust from butter flavorings used in microwave popcorn production.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000592', None, 'Q000592', None]","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'standards', None, 'standards', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16998985,2006

15135153,"Clinical studies have demonstrated that consumption of phytosterol esters in lipid-based foods decreases serum concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol. These substances represent minimal potential for adverse effects when consumed orally because of their low bioavailability. However, some studies have reported estrogenic and other effects in laboratory animals treated parenterally with phytosterols, demonstrating that these substances may have the potential to cause adverse effects if absorbed. Water-soluble phytosterols have been prepared by formulation with emulsifiers to expand delivery options to include non-lipid-based foods. However, emulsifiers are used as excipients in the formulation of lipophilic pharmaceuticals to increase solubility, thereby increasing their absorption. Therefore, oral consumption of emulsified water-soluble phytosterols could potentially increase their absorption. In the current study, absorption of phytosterols prepared as water-soluble emulsified micelles with two different food-grade emulsifiers was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats and compared with absorption of non-micellar free phytosterols and esterified phytosterol mixtures dissolved in a lipophilic vehicle (soybean oil). Rats were dosed via gavage with 42 mg/kg of formulated phytosterol preparations. Blood was collected at 8, 16, 24, and 32 hours, extracted with hexane, derivatized with benzoyl chloride, and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to determine concentrations of beta-sitosterol, and campesterol. Plasma concentrations and AUC(0-32 hours) [microg/mL/h] of beta-sitosterol and campesterol were lower in plasma obtained from rats treated with emulsified phytosterol preparations than in animals treated with free phytosterols dissolved in soybean oil.

Furthermore, these effects were greater in CE than CO, although there was little difference in the fatty acid composition of both oils. Although the main lipid class of CE was TG (>99%), CE was prepared by centrifugation from surimi waste and directly used as dietary fat without further purification. Therefore, CE may contain some kinds of minor components, which could be attributed to the higher physiological activity of CE.

11911490,"Epidemiological studies have indicated that the exposure to carcinogenic components formed during the cooking of food might be associated with lung cancer risk of Chinese women. Previous studies have confirmed that cooking oil fumes from frying fish (COF) contained relatively high amount of benzo[a]pyrene, 2-methyl-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f] qunoxaline, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene, reported in fumes from heated soybean oil. Thus, we consider that oxidative stress induced by COF may play a role in lung cancer development among Chinese women. To verify whether the oxidative DNA damage was induced by COF, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis data showed that the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine (8-OH dG) were increased in a dose-dependent manner when calf thymus DNA reacted with various concentrations of COF. Since human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) was a repair enzyme for removing 8- OH dG from damaged DNA, we hypothesized that hOGG1 mRNA may be used to assess the risk of oxidative damage induced by the exposure of COF. The results from reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the hOGG1 mRNA expression was induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and COF in human lung adenocarcinoma CL-3 cells. To elucidate whether hOGG1 mRNA expression was an exposure biomarker of COF, a cross-sectional study of 238 subjects including 94 professional cooks, 43 housewives, and 101 COF-nonexposed control subjects was conducted. The hOGG1 mRNA expression frequencies of COF-exposed cooks (27 of 94, 28.7%) and housewives (6 of 43, 14%) were significantly higher than those of control subjects (4 of 101, 4%). After adjusting for age, sex, and smoking and drinking status, the odds risks (ORs) of housewives versus control and cooks versus control were 3.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95-16.62) and 10.12 (95% CI = 2.83-36.15), respectively. These results indicated that hOGG1 may be adequate to act as an exposure biomarker to assess the oxidative DNA damage induced by COF. This also suggests that oxidative stress induced by COF may play a role in lung cancer development among Chinese women.",Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

11588904,"The tocopherols, the major vitamers of vitamin E, are believed to play a role in the prevention of human aging-related diseases such as cancer and heart disease, yet little is known concerning determinants of their plasma concentrations. Evidence from animal studies suggests that the dietary source of gamma-tocopherol can significantly affect plasma levels of this tocopherol as well as its functional vitamin E activity. To determine whether plasma levels of tocopherols in humans are similarly altered, a study was undertaken in which subjects (n = 9) were fed muffins containing equivalent amounts of gamma-tocopherol from sesame seeds, walnuts, or soy oil. We observed that consumption of as little as 5 mg of gamma-tocopherol per day over a three-day period from sesame seeds, but not from walnuts or soy oil, significantly elevated serum gamma-tocopherol levels (19.1% increase, p = 0.03) and depressed plasma beta-tocopherol (34% decrease, p = 0.01). No significant changes in baseline or postintervention plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, or carotenoids were seen for any of the intervention groups. All subjects consuming sesame seed-containing muffins had detectable levels of the sesame lignan sesamolin in their plasma. Consumption of moderate amounts of sesame seeds appears to significantly increase plasma gamma-tocopherol and alter plasma tocopherol ratios in humans and is consistent with the effects of dietary sesame seeds observed in rats leading to elevated plasma gamma-tocopherol and enhanced vitamin E bioactivity.",Nutrition and cancer,"['D000328', 'D000375', 'D000975', 'D001939', 'D002851', 'D004149', 'D005260', 'D005504', 'D006801', 'D017705', 'D008297', 'D008875', 'D009754', 'D012639', 'D012715', 'D013024', 'D024505', 'D024504']","['Adult', 'Aging', 'Antioxidants', 'Bread', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dioxoles', 'Female', 'Food Analysis', 'Humans', 'Lignans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuts', 'Seeds', 'Sesame Oil', 'Soybean Oil', 'Tocopherols', 'gamma-Tocopherol']",Effects of dietary sesame seeds on plasma tocopherol levels.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000008', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000097', 'Q000008']","[None, 'metabolism', 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'blood', 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11588904,2002

In the first experiment, 60 24-wk-old Single Comb White Leghorn (SCWL) hens were divided among four dietary treatments, including a typical corn-soybean control (CON); 1.5% MO, supplying 233 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 155 mg DHA per d; 2.4% MA, supplying 200 mg DHA/d; and 4.8% MA, supplying 400 mg DHA/d. A second experiment using 96 56-wk-old SCWL was conducted using the same diets. In both experiments, eggs were collected weekly for 4 wk for determination of egg production parameters and yolk FA content. Each week, yolk samples were extracted, methyl estered, and quantified using gas chromatography. Transient depression in egg and yolk weights were noted early in Experiment 1 in response to dietary 4.8% MA. Although egg and yolk weights were not affected in Experiment 2, egg production was significantly reduced in the 4.8% MA treatment. Egg production was unaffected due to diet or week in Experiment 1. In both experiments, yolk polyunsaturated profiles were significantly influenced by diet. Dietary n-3 FA supplementation significantly increased yolk total N-3 FA with concomitant reductions in yolk n-6 FA. Although hens fed MO were supplied predominantly EPA, the principal yolk FA deposited was DHA. Marine algae also promoted efficient yolk DHA deposition with the highest yolk DHA concentrations attained in eggs from hens fed 4.8% MA. These data indicate that utilization of MA as a direct source of dietary n-3 FA may provide an efficient alternative to current sources of n-3 FA available for the production of poultry products rich in n-3 FA.",Poultry science,"['D000821', 'D000818', 'D002645', 'D004281', 'D004528', 'D004530', 'D004531', 'D056890', 'D015525', 'D005260', 'D005395', 'D005527', 'D010058', 'D012623']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids', 'Egg Shell', 'Egg Yolk', 'Eggs', 'Eukaryota', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3', 'Female', 'Fish Oils', 'Food, Fortified', 'Oviposition', 'Seawater']",Dietary marine algae promotes efficient deposition of n-3 fatty acids for the production of enriched shell eggs.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9000275,1997

Phytic acid, oxalic acid, tannin and sodium alginate, however, react with iron(II) or iron(III)-salts at pH values of 3.0, 5.5 and 8.0, giving rise to iron complexes. Trimethylamine-N-oxide, which is present in fish meal, reacts with iron(II)-sulphate to produce iron(III) reaction products; it does not react with iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex. Special soybean flours show no irreversible adsorption or precipitation with iron(III)-hydroxyide polymaltose complex over the pH range 3.0-8.0, in contrast to iron(II)-sulphate. Antacids containing aluminium hydroxide, talc, ion exchange resins or other unabsorbable, insoluble components absorb iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex in the pH range 3.0-8.0 in a reversible manner, while the strong adsorption or precipitation observed with iron(II)-sulphate at pH 8.0 is irreversible. No interaction was observed between the steroid hormones studied and iron(II)-sulphate or iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex.

3745745,"As part of a human diet study, vitamin E activity was estimated in foods used in seven daily menus. Each menu was designed to contain 35% fat calories with either 10 or 30 gm/day of linoleic acid (18:2) and 500 mg/day of cholesterol. To estimate vitamin E activity, each food used in the menus was analyzed for alpha and gamma tocopherol content by high-pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. This article reports the alpha and gamma tocopherol contents of those foods, tocopherol contributions from each food in one sample 2,400-kcal menu, and the mean daily vitamin E activity (milligram alpha tocopherol equivalents) of all seven menus at five caloric levels. Major sources of alpha tocopherol (greater than 10% of the RDA) common to both diets (10 and 30 gm linoleic acid) were olive oil and a few fruits and vegetables. Additional major sources in the 30-gm linoleic acid diets were polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) vegetable oils and margarine. Contrary to a common assumption, increasing the level of PUFA in the menus did not necessarily result in higher milligram equivalents of alpha tocopherol because soybean oil, with a tocopherol composition that is predominantly gamma tocopherol, was the major source of linoleic acid in the diets. Thus, vitamin E activity was not necessarily increased when soybean oil was substituted for a less saturated fat such as olive oil, which has mostly alpha tocopherol.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,"['D002851', 'D005231', 'D005504', 'D019787', 'D008041', 'D009751', 'D014810']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Linoleic Acids', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Vitamin E']",Vitamin E in foods from high and low linoleic acid diets.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3745745,1986
