32800224,"Spinetoram (XDE-175-J/L), a new spinosyn-based insecticide, is one of the most widely used bio-pesticide worldwide and its registration for direct application on cauliflower to control Plutella xylostella is currently under review in China. In this study, an accredited method for simultaneous determination of spinetoram and its two metabolites in cauliflower was established and validated using QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) preparation coupled with ultra-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The average recoveries using this method were ranged from 74 to 99% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.4-10.5%. The dissipation kinetics and terminal residues of spinetoram and its two metabolites in cauliflower were studied in Tianjin and Guizhou over two years under open field conditions. The dissipation experiments revealed that spinetoram was swiftly degraded in cauliflower, with the half-lives less than or equal to 4.85 days. The terminal residues of total spinetoram (sum of spinetoram and its two metabolites) detected in cauliflower samples were in the range of 0.009 mg/kg-0.337 mg/kg. Dietary risk assessment study was implemented based on the scientific data of field trials, food consumption and acceptable daily intake (ADI). The estimated long-term dietary risk probability (RQ) of total spinetoram from cauliflower was between 5.79% and 5.91%, indicating that spinetoram was associated with acceptable risk for dietary cauliflower consumption. The results would provide scientific guidance for proper usage of spinetoram in cauliflower field ecosystem.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,"['D001937', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004032', 'D017753', 'D007306', 'D007700', 'D018942', 'D010573', 'D018570', 'D053719']","['Brassica', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Insecticides', 'Kinetics', 'Macrolides', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Residue behavior and dietary risk assessment of spinetoram (XDE-175-J/L) and its two metabolites in cauliflower using QuEChERS method coupled with UPLC-MS/MS.,"['Q000502', None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000633', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379']","['physiology', None, 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'toxicity', 'analysis', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32800224,2020

32208468,"Pesticides, widely used in modern agriculture, could potentially cause environmental pollution and affect human lives. Hence, the development of a highly sensitive sensing element to detect pesticide residues is crucial for food safety and ecosystem protection. Optical methods based on fluorescence properties provide an ideal approach for screening and quantification of these compounds in different medias including water, plant, and nutritional products. The development of fluorescence emitting carbon dot-based sensors for monitoring pesticides has attracted great attention in recent years. In comparison to other fluorophores, carbon dots have more promising optical features, higher quantum yields and better biocompatibility. This article aims to present a novel fluorescent sensing method of diazinon, glyphosate, and amicarbazone using plant-based carbon dots. A comprehensive characterization of carbon dots obtained from cauliflower was performed by methods including UV-visible, FTIR spectroscopy, fluorometry, AFM, DLS, and zeta sizer. Following this step, carbon dots were used to detect pesticides. The fluorescence quenching property of carbon dots has been utilized to identify detection limit of 0.25, 0.5, and 2 ng ml-1 for diazinon, amicarbazone, and glyphosate, respectively. Also, real sample study revealed that the detection of pesticides accompanied by our developed nano-sensor is repeatable and accurate. According to carbon dots specificity determination, the prepared nano sensor does not have the potential to identify ""bromacil"" and ""dialen super"" pesticides but the other three mentioned pesticides are detectable. The results confirm that synthesized green carbon dots are well qualified for application in food safety and environmental monitoring.",PloS one,"['D002244', 'D003976', 'D004784', 'D005506', 'D005998', 'D057230', 'D018551', 'D010575', 'D045663', 'D013050', 'D014230']","['Carbon', 'Diazinon', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Food Contamination', 'Glycine', 'Limit of Detection', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Pesticides', 'Quantum Dots', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Triazoles']",Ultrasensitive fluorescent detection of pesticides in real sample by using green carbon dots.,"['Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","['chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32208468,2020

31108982,"Chlorfluazuron is used as a highly effective insect growth regulator to control a variety of crop pests. However, residues of this pesticide have been shown to be harmful to human health. To evaluate the residual dissipation pattern and risk for dietary intake of chlorfluazuron in various vegetables, a solid phase extraction-ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was established to analyze chlorfluazuron residues in Chinese cabbage, Chinese kale, Chinese lettuce, and cauliflower. The sample was extracted with acetonitrile and purified using an SPE amino column. The average recovery of the target sample in the analyzed four vegetables was between 75.0% and 104.1%, and the relative standard deviation was between 2.5% and 9.6%. The precision and accuracy of the analysis met the requirements of residue analysis standards. Dissipation kinetic testing of chlorfluazuron in different vegetables showed a half-life of 2.4-12.6 days, with a rapid dissipation rate. The estimated daily intake of the chlorfluazuron was 0.753-1.661 μg/(kg bw·d), and the risk quotient was 0.15-0.35.

Analysis of glucosinolate profiles revealed that each Brassica crop accumulated different types and amounts of glucosinolates. Cauliflower sprouts had high total glucosinolate content. Broccoli sprouts contained high levels of glucoraphanin, a precursor for potent anticancer compound. Although studies have reported an inverse relationship between accumulation of Se and glucosinolates in mature Brassica plants, Se supply generally did not affect glucosinolate accumulation in Brassica sprouts.

Stromal and membrane proteins of chromoplasts were separated by 1D gel electrophoresis and analysed using nLC-MS/MS. A total of 953-2262 proteins from chromoplasts of different crop species were identified. Approximately 60% of the identified proteins were predicted to be plastid localized. Functional classification using MapMan bins revealed large numbers of proteins involved in protein metabolism, transport, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and redox in chromoplasts from all six species.

22351174,"The Brassicaceae family comprises a variety of plant species that are of high economic importance as -vegetables or industrial crops. This includes crops such as Brassica rapa (turnip, Bok Choi), B. oleracea (cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), and B. napus (oil seed rape), and also includes the famous genetic model of plant research, Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress). Brassicaceae plants contain a large variety of interesting secondary metabolites, including glucosinolates, hydroxycinnamic acids, and flavonoids. These metabolites are also of particular importance due to their proposed positive effects on human health. Next to these well-known groups of phytochemicals, many more metabolites are of course also present in crude extracts prepared from Brassica and Arabidopsis plant material.High-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), especially if combined with a high mass resolution instrument such as a QTOF MS, is a powerful approach to separate, detect, and annotate metabolites present in crude aqueous-alcohol plant extracts. Using an essentially unbiased procedure that takes into account all metabolite mass signals from the raw data files, detailed information on the relative abundance of hundreds of both known and, as yet, unknown semipolar metabolites can be obtained. These comprehensive metabolomics data can then be used to, for instance, identify genetic markers regulating metabolic composition, determine effects of (a)biotic stress or specific growth conditions, or establish metabolite changes occurring upon food processing or storage.This chapter describes in detail a procedure for preparing crude extracts and performing comprehensive HPLC-QTOF MS-based profiling of semi-polar metabolites in Brassicaceae plant material. Compounds present in the extract can be (partially or completely) annotated based on their accurate mass, their MS/MS fragments and on other specific chemical characteristics such as retention time and UV-absorbance spectrum.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","['D017360', 'D019607', 'D002851', 'D003373', 'D005419', 'D005961', 'D055442', 'D055432']","['Arabidopsis', 'Brassicaceae', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Flavonoids', 'Glucosinolates', 'Metabolome', 'Metabolomics']",High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of plant metabolites in brassicaceae.,"['Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","['metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22351174,2012

21770413,"In plants, folate occurs predominantly as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF) polyglutamyl forms. Differences in stability and bioavailability of food folate compared to synthetic folic acid have been attributed to the presence of the polyglutamyl chain. High-pressure processing (HPP) was tested for whether it might shorten polyglutamyl chains of 5MTHF species in fresh vegetables by enabling action of native γ-glutamylhydrolase (GGH). A validated ultrahigh-performance reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using stable isotope as internal standard was applied for characterizing 5MTHF polyglutamyl profiles. HPP conditions included 300, 450, and 600 MPa at 30 °C for 0 or 5 min, and vegetables were vacuum-packed before treatment. Investigated vegetables included cauliflower (Brassica oleracea), baby carrots (Daucus carota), and carrot greens (D. carota). HPP treatment caused conversion of polyglutamyl 5MTHF species to short-chain and monoglutamyl forms. Maximal conversion of polyglutamyl folate to monoglutamyl folate occurred at the highest pressure/time combination investigated, 600 MPa/30 °C/5 min. Under this condition, cauliflower monoglutamyl folate increased nearly 4-fold, diglutamyl folate 32-fold, and triglutamyl folate 8-fold; carrot monoglutamyl increased 23-fold and diglutamyl 32-fold; and carrot greens monoglutamyl increased 2.5-fold and the diglutamyl form 19-fold. Although some folate degradation was observed at certain intermediate HPP conditions, total 5MTHF folate was largely preserved at 600 MPa/5 min.

MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) analyses confirmed the Western blot data. Interestingly, Western blots of the same mitochondrial extracts were almost completely negative for H3 when the primary antibodies were highly specific for the N-terminal tail region of H3, suggesting that these antibodies are blocked by a modification of the tail of the H3 that occurs predominantly in the mitochondria, but not in the nucleus.

17337530,"Based on the ability of phytosiderophores to chelate other heavy metals besides iron (Fe), phytosiderophores were suggested to prevent graminaceous plants from cadmium (Cd) toxicity. To assess interactions between Cd and phytosiderophore-mediated Fe acquisition, maize (Zea mays) plants were grown hydroponically under limiting Fe supply. Exposure to Cd decreased uptake rates of 59Fe(III)-phytosiderophores and enhanced the expression of the Fe-phytosiderophore transporter gene ZmYS1 in roots as well as the release of the phytosiderophore 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) from roots under Fe deficiency. However, DMA hardly mobilized Cd from soil or from a Cd-loaded resin in comparison to the synthetic chelators diaminetriaminepentaacetic acid and HEDTA. While nano-electrospray-high resolution mass spectrometry revealed the formation of an intact Cd(II)-DMA complex in aqueous solutions, competition studies with Fe(III) and zinc(II) showed that the formed Cd(II)-DMA complex was weak. Unlike HEDTA, DMA did not protect yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells from Cd toxicity but improved yeast growth in the presence of Cd when yeast cells expressed ZmYS1. When supplied with Fe-DMA as a Fe source, transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants expressing a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-ZmYS1 gene construct showed less growth depression than wild-type plants in response to Cd. These results indicate that inhibition of ZmYS1-mediated Fe-DMA transport by Cd is not related to Cd-DMA complex formation and that Cd-induced phytosiderophore release cannot protect maize plants from Cd toxicity. Instead, phytosiderophore-mediated Fe acquisition can improve Fe uptake in the presence of Cd and thereby provides an advantage under Cd stress relative to Fe acquisition via ferrous Fe.",Plant physiology,"['D000222', 'D002104', 'D017343', 'D007501', 'D008969', 'D017262', 'D021241', 'D017550', 'D003313']","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Cadmium', 'Genes, Plant', 'Iron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Siderophores', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Zea mays']",Iron acquisition by phytosiderophores contributes to cadmium tolerance.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000235']","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17337530,2007
17168899,"Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) tissues were transformed with a grape (Vitis vinifera L.) stilbene synthase cDNA, transcriptionally regulated by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Transgenic plants accumulated new compounds, not present in either wild-type or vector-transformed plants. These were identified, by high-pressure liquid chromatography, as trans-resveratrol and trans-resveratrol-glucopyranoside. The amounts of trans-resveratrol and its piceid form were evaluated in the transgenic fruit. It was found that the content of the metabolite varied during fruit maturation to up to 53 microg/g fresh weight of total trans-resveratrol at the red stage of ripening. This metabolite accumulation was possibly dependent on a combination of sufficiently high levels of stilbene synthase and the availability of substrates. With the aim of verifing the metabolic impairment, the amounts of chlorogenic acid and naringenin in both transgenic and wild-type ripening fruit were compared and no dramatic variation in the synthesis profile of the two metabolites was noted. To our knowledge, no data are available on the assessment of the effects of the expression of the StSy gene on other antioxidant compounds present in tomato fruit. To establish whether the presence of a novel antioxidant molecule affected the redox regulation in transgenic tomato fruit cells, the effect of resveratrol accumulation on the naturally present antioxidant pool was analysed. We showed that, in transgenic fruit which accumulate trans-resveratrol, there is an increase in the levels of ascorbate and glutathione, the soluble antioxidants of primary metabolism, as well as in the total antioxidant activity. Conversely, the content of tocopherol and lycopene, which are membrane-located antioxidants, is not affected.

17041029,"The U-box motif is a conserved domain found in the diverse isoforms of E3 ubiquitin ligase in eukaryotes. From water-stressed hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv Pukang) plants, we isolated C. annuum putative U-box protein 1 (CaPUB1), which encodes a protein containing a single U-box motif in its N-terminal region. In vitro ubiquitination and site-directed mutagenesis assays revealed that CaPUB1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and that the U-box motif was indeed essential for its enzyme activity. RNA gel-blot analysis showed that CaPUB1 mRNA was induced rapidly by a broad spectrum of abiotic stresses, including drought, high salinity, cold temperature, and mechanical wounding, but not in response to ethylene, abscisic acid, or a bacterial pathogen, suggesting its role in the early events in the abiotic-related defense response. Because transgenic work was extremely difficult in hot pepper, in this study we overexpressed CaPUB1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to provide cellular information on the function of this gene in the development and plant responses to abiotic stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively expressed the CaPUB1 gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter had markedly longer hypocotyls and roots and grew more rapidly than the wild type, leading to an early bolting phenotype. Microscopic analysis showed that 35S::CaPUB1 roots had increased numbers of small-sized cells, resulting in disordered, highly populated cell layers in the cortex, endodermis, and stele. In addition, CaPUB1-overexpressing plants displayed increased sensitivity to water stress and mild salinity. These results indicate that CaPUB1 is functional in Arabidopsis cells, thereby effectively altering cell and tissue growth and also the response to abiotic stresses. Comparative proteomic analysis showed that the level of RPN6 protein, a non-ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome complex, was significantly reduced in 35SCaPUB1 seedlings as compared to the wild type. Pull-down and ubiquitination assays demonstrated that RPN6 interacted physically with CaPUB1 and was ubiquitinated in a CaPUB1-dependent manner in vitro. Although the physiological function of CaPUB1 is not yet clear, there are several possibilities for its involvement in a subset of physiological responses to counteract dehydration and high-salinity stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings.",Plant physiology,"['D020816', 'D000595', 'D017360', 'D002212', 'D049109', 'D018076', 'D015180', 'D010450', 'D004926', 'D008969', 'D010641', 'D010940', 'D030821', 'D040901', 'D012441', 'D029701', 'D016415', 'D019032', 'D044767']","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Capsicum', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Endopeptidases', 'Escherichia coli', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Proteomics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",Heterologous expression and molecular and cellular characterization of CaPUB1 encoding a hot pepper U-Box E3 ubiquitin ligase homolog.,"[None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'genetics', 'enzymology', None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', 'genetics', None, None, 'chemistry', 'cytology', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17041029,2007

All antibiotic resistant genes currently employed are of bacterial origin and their presence in the field is undesirable. Therefore, we developed a novel and efficient plant native non-antibiotic selection system for the selection of transgenic plants in the model system Arabidopsis.

We successfully integrated an expression cassette containing an AtT-SB1 cDNA driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter into Arabidopsis by floral dip transformation. Transgenic plants were efficiently selected on MS medium supplemented with 75 microM 5MT or 300 microM CdCl2 devoid of antibiotics.

Northern blot analysis of transgenic plants selected by 5MT and CdCl2 revealed increased TSB1 mRNA transcript whereas uneven transcript levels of hygromycin phosphotransferase II (hpt) (control) was observed. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed 10-15 fold greater free Trp content in AtT-SB1 transgenic plants than in wild-type plants grown with or without 5MT or CdCl2.

These associations are linked to dietary intake of glucosinolates and their metabolism to cancer preventive isothiocyanates. Bioavailability of glucosinolates and related isothiocyanates are influenced by storage and culinary processing of Brassica vegetables. In this work, the content of the 7 major glucosinolates in broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green cabbage and their stability under different storage and cooking conditions is examined. Glucosinolates and isothiocyanates were quantified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS). Isothiocyanates were detected with high sensitivity as the corresponding thiourea derivatives. Storage at ambient temperature and in a domestic refrigerator showed no significant difference and a minor loss (9-26%) of glucosinolate levels over 7 days. Vegetables shredded finely showed a marked decline of glucosinolate level with post-shredding dwell time - up to 75% over 6h. Glucosinolate losses were detected partly as isothiocyanates. Cooking by steaming, microwaving and stir-fry did not produce significant loss of glucosinolates whereas boiling showed significant losses by leaching into cooking water.

Green tuber, cabbage and cauliflower were selected as raw materials to make sauerkraut in family way. The nitrite content in pickles and sauerkraut was determined by spectrophotometry with 1-Amino-2-(a-naphthy lamine) ethoine dihydrochloride. The nitrite content in mustard was 258.8 mg/kg when 6% salt was used and pickling for 8 days; the nitrite content was 235.9 mg/kg when 15% salt was used and pickling for 15 days. There was no nitrite in mustard when pickling for 35 days. The nitrite content in the sauerkraut was 258.7 mg/kg when pickling for 6 days and no nitrite was found after 20 days. The higher nitrite content in pickle and sauerkraut could be eliminated by water. The elimination ratio was 91% for leafy sauerkraut and semi-manufactured cut mustard and only 72% for whole mustard. It was concluded that pickles and sauerkraut that pickled for enough time (for leafy vegetable more than 20 days, for tuber more than 35 days) had no harm for people to eat, The higher nitrite content in pickles and sauerkrauts could be reduced by 91% with water for several times.",Wei sheng yan jiu = Journal of hygiene research,"['D005519', 'D009573', 'D014675']","['Food Preservation', 'Nitrites', 'Vegetables']",[Research on the dynamic variation and elimination of nitrite content in sauerkraut during pickling].,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12561618,2003

Comparative values are given from a background area, namely a domestic garden located in the North Yorkshire Dales National Park area. Analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quality control assessment using four international biological reference materials; BCR:CRM 62 Olive Leaves, NIST 1575 Pine Needles, NIST 1573 Tomato Leaves, and NIST 1572 Citrus Leaves. Inter-analytical method comparison is given using two methods of ICP-MS; namely conventional pneumatic nebulisation of sample solution, and direct solids analysis by laser ablation; and neutron activation analysis methods (NAA). For the elements listed there is a good precision obtained by ICP-MS and NAA. In particular levels of < +/- 1-10% (rsd) are obtained. Comparison of data with certified values and other analytical methods are generally of very good agreement. Lead levels in background areas ranged from 0.0008 to 0.340 microgram/g (fresh weight) for plant material; with the lead magnitude greater for grasses > herbs > vegetables > cereals > fruits. Measured values are in good agreement with reported literature values. The lowest Pb values are for marrow, lettuce, tomato and sweet corn samples (approximately 0.001-0.021 microgram/g). 'Green' leaf material levels were approximately 0.02-0.10 microgram/g (i.e. sprouts and cabbage). Root vegetables contain higher levels, approximately 0.02-0.125 microgram/g (especially carrot), reflecting possible metal uptake from soil.

R., and Ravel, J. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11228-11232). One form, designated eIF-4F, is a complex containing two subunits, p220 and p26. The other form, designated eIF-(iso)4F, is a complex containing two subunits, p82 and p28, which are antigenically distinct from the subunits of eIF-4F. Both the p26 subunit of eIF-4F and the p28 subunit of eIF-(iso)4F are m7G cap-binding proteins. In this investigation, affinity-purified antibodies to the p220 and p26 subunits of wheat germ eIF-4F and to the p82 and p28 subunits of wheat germ eIF-(iso)4F were used to determine if isozyme forms of eIF-4F are present in maize and cauliflower. Extracts from wheat germ, maize root tips, and cauliflower inflorescences were partially purified by adsorption on m7GTP-Sepharose and elution with m7GTP (MGS eluate). Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies to the subunits of the wheat germ factors showed that the MGS eluate from maize contains polypeptides that react with antibodies to the p82 and p28 subunits of wheat eIF-(iso)4F, as well as polypeptides that react with antibodies to the p220 and p26 subunits of wheat eIF-4F. The MGS eluate from cauliflower also contains polypeptides that reacted with antibodies to the subunits of wheat eIF-(iso)4F. These results indicate that both maize and cauliflower contain the isozyme form of eIF-4F.

I3C is both an anti-initiator and a promoter of carcinogenesis. Consumption of I3C by humans and rodents can lead to marked increases in activities of cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenases and in a variety of phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes. We have reported previously that the enzyme-inducing activity of I3C is mediated through a mechanism requiring exposure of the compound to the low-pH environment of the stomach.

One of these, TFIIA, is involved in the earliest events during transcription complex assembly. We have purified TFIIA from wheat germ and characterized it in an in vitro transcription system. Wheat TFIIA is a single polypeptide of Mr approximately 35 kd which functionally replaces human (HeLa) TFIIA to form a wheat/HeLa transcription system. [This polypeptide can be eluted from a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, refolded to a native conformation, and will function as wheat TFIIA in the heterologous system.] The heterologous system requires a lower optimal incubation temperature than the HeLa system.

K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Rb and Sr were the elements of which the total content and distribution between cytosol and pellet were determined. As a result of the cellular digestion and extraction procedures employed, greater than or equal to 50% of the total metal contents of Zn, Cu, K and Rb could be reduced to the cytosol phase in both vegetables, however, Sr, Fe, Ca and Mn were mainly bound to the insoluble pellet components which, in the case of cauliflower, contained up to 100% of the total Sr content. As a multielement method, TXRF proved to be an excellent analytical tool in these investigations, since it requires only minute samples with simple preparation and involves a large dynamic measuring scale.",Zeitschrift fur Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung,"['D002118', 'D002458', 'D003300', 'D003600', 'D005504', 'D007501', 'D008345', 'D011188', 'D012413', 'D013052', 'D013324', 'D014675', 'D015032']","['Calcium', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Copper', 'Cytosol', 'Food Analysis', 'Iron', 'Manganese', 'Potassium', 'Rubidium', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission', 'Strontium', 'Vegetables', 'Zinc']",Simultaneous multielement determination in vegetable foodstuffs and their respective cell fractions by total-reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF).,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2343677,1990
3391959,"A simplified method is described for determining 7 N-methyl carbamates (aldicarb, carbaryl, carbofuran, methiocarb, methomyl, oxamyl, and propoxur) and 3 related metabolites (aldicarb sulfoxide, aldicarb sulfone, and 3-hydroxy carbofuran) in fruits and vegetables. Residues are extracted from crops with methanol; coextractives are then separated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) or GPC with on-line Nuchar-Celite cleanup for crops with high chlorophyll and/or carotene content (e.g., cabbage and broccoli). Carbamates are separated on a reverse-phase liquid chromatography column, using a methanol-water gradient mobile phase. Separation is followed by postcolumn hydrolysis to yield methylamine, and the formation of a fluorophore with o-phthalaldehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol prior to fluorescence detection. Recovery data were obtained by fortifying 5 different crops (apples, broccoli, cabbages, cauliflower, and potatoes) at 0.05 and 0.5 ppm. Recoveries averaged 93% at both fortification levels except for the very polar aldicarb sulfoxide for which recoveries averaged around 52% at both levels. The coefficient of variation of the method at both levels is less than 5% and the limit of detection, defined at 5 times baseline noise, varies between 5 and 10 ppb, depending on the compound.",Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,"['D002219', 'D002850', 'D002853', 'D005638', 'D007202', 'D007306', 'D010573', 'D013050', 'D014675']","['Carbamates', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Fruit', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Insecticides', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Vegetables']",Simplified multiresidue method for liquid chromatographic determination of N-methyl carbamate insecticides in fruits and vegetables.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3391959,1988
16662073,"NAD-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.39) was obtained from isolated mitochondria of cauliflower buds (Brassica oleracea L., var. botrytis). The NAD-linked activity is accompanied by a minor NADP-linked activity. Some contaminant NADP-malic enzyme from the supernatant and the plasma membrane is usually present in crude mitochondrial preparations. NAD-dependent malic enzyme has been purified 38-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation and gel permeation chromatography, to a specific activity up to 2 micromoles per minute per milligram.The nature of the activating effect of coenzyme A and dithiothreitol has been investigated. Both compounds act by decreasing the apparent Michaelis constants for l-malate and NAD(+) (and NADP(+)), V(max) remaining approximately constant. However, enzyme fully activated by dithiothreitol can still be stimulated up to 2.4-fold by coenzyme A treatment.Velocity versus substrate responses show hyperbolic kinetics under present assay conditions (pH 7.5, 2 millimolar Mn(2+)), but biphasic kinetics have been observed with enzyme purified in the presence of 10 millimolar dithiothreitol, suggesting enzyme heterogeneity with respect to an activated state. This condition is reverted to linearity by treatment with coenzyme A. K(m) values do not vary with changing concentrations of the second substrate. Enzyme molecular weight is 400,000 in the completely activated state and 200,000 in the ;inactivated' state; intermediate forms are also found. All coenzyme A derivatives tested are effective activators, showing activation constants lower than for coenzyme A itself. The concentration dependence of the activation is sigmoidal.",Plant physiology,[],[],Activation Kinetics of NAD-Dependent Malic Enzyme of Cauliflower Bud Mitochondria.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16662073,2010
