35205985,"Ginger, a plant widely consumed worldwide, is used as a spice or to enhance the flavor of foods. In this study, the taste characteristics (gingerol, shogaol, and amino acid) of extracts treated with various solubilizing methods were objectively compared. In addition, an E-nose confirmed the flavor pattern combined with principal component analysis (PCA) between each extract gas chromatogram-tandem mass spectrometry was performed to compare and analyze volatile compounds between extraction methods. As a result, high-pressure enzyme-assisted extraction (HPE) and hydrothermal enzyme-assisted extraction (HWE) treatment effectively improved the extraction yield of ginger and the contents of gingerol and shogaol and removed the bitter taste. In addition, radar charts of both E-nose and PCA provided the distribution of flavor substances in HPE and HWE products of ginger. After enzyme-assisted treatment, a strong fruity and piquant flavor was noted.

The adoption of inline cleanup LFIA strips effectively improved background interference to reduce misjudgment of results. First, the hapten 2-(methylamino)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid was used to establish the carbendazim immunoassay method. Subsequently, colloidal gold-mAb preparation and LFIA detection conditions were systematically optimized. For root and fruit samples (ginseng, ginger, jujube, and Chinese wolfberry), the designed strips had a cutoff value of 8 ng/mL. For flower and seed samples (chrysanthemum, coix seed, and malt), the cutoff value was 12 ng/mL. Even in a complex matrix, the established LFIA method demonstrates satisfactory sensitivity and anti-interference ability. This method was successfully applied in detection of carbendazim residues in complex functional foods, and the assay results are consistent with those obtained via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

33774787,"Among food and agricultural products, spices play important roles in the diets of millions of people worldwide. These products may be colonized by fungi genus and subsequently mycotoxin production. Due to the large demand and supply of spice for cooking, preservative effects, or medicine purpose, it is essential that further investigation is designed to examine mycotoxins in spice. In the present study, the possible contamination of spices by aflatoxins (AFTs) and ochratoxin A (OTA) were analyzed. A total of 80 spice samples (curry, sumac, ginger, and saffron) were purchased and cultured on appropriate medium. Simultaneously mycotoxins from spices were extracted with immunoaffinity columns (IAC), and the occurrence of AFTs (B1 + B2 + G1 + G2) and OTA was then determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a fluorescence detector (FD). The results depicted that 62 (77.5%) and 58 (72.5%) spice samples were contaminated with AFTs and OTA, respectively. Out of the 80 analyzed spices samples, the mean concentration of AFTs and OTA was higher in the curry samples. Among spices that contaminated with mycotoxins, 5 (6.25%) and 2 (10%) of the samples were above the acceptable limit of AFTs (≥ 10 μg/kg) and OTA (≥ 15 μg/kg), respectively. Aspergillus species were the predominant species isolated, followed by Penicillium, and finally Mucor species.Among the examined samples, only few curry samples were contaminated with mycotoxins above acceptable limit. Despite this low level of contamination, this spice is used daily in the cuisine of this region of the world, and consequently, even the small amount of these heat stable toxins for a long time may cause many adverse effects.

The oils are made up of a mixture of compounds that give a characteristic flavour and odour. Currently, essential oils are receiving great attention in research for their phytochemical and antimicrobial activities. However, there is scanty information on the chemical composition of many plants. This study provides a detailed analysis of the chemical composition of essential oils of ginger, garlic, tick berry, and Mexican marigold in Kenya. The essential oils were extracted by steam distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The study identified a total of 52 different chemical classes from the essential oils of the four different plants that were analysed. Their percentage composition was also found to vary between the test plants. The essential oils of Mexican marigold constituted the highest composition of the identified chemical classes at 71.2%, followed by ginger at 55.8%, while both tick berry and garlic oils constituted 53.8% of the total classes identified. Terpenes constituted the highest composition in the essential oils of all the four test plants. Other major chemical classes included esters, ketones, organosulfurs, alkanes, cycloalkanes, steroids, aromatic hydrocarbons, and alkanols.

32719085,"Commercial formulations of 29 commonly used herbal supplements (HSs) and grapefruit juice were evaluated for drug interaction potential via quantification of their CYP3A inhibitory potential in two in vitro experimental models of human small intestine, cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa (CHIM), and cryopreserved human enterocytes (CHEs). Two CYP3A substrates were used-in the studies with CHIM, CYP3A activity was quantified via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry quantification of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, whereas in CHE, luciferin-IPA metabolism to luciferin was quantified by luminescence. Upon treatment of CHIM with the estimated lumen concentration of the HS upon each oral administration (manufacturers' recommended dosage dissolved in 200 ml of culture medium), >80% CYP3A inhibition was observed for green tea extract, St. John's wort, valerian root, horehound, and grapefruit juice. Less than 50% inhibition was observed for fenugreek, aloe vera, guarana, soy isoflavone, maca, echinacea, spirulina, evening primrose, milk thistle, cranberry, red yeast rice, rhodiola, ginkgo biloba, turmeric, curcumin, white kidney bean, garlic, cinnamon, saw palmetto berries, panax ginseng, black elderberry, wheat grass juice, flaxseed oil, black cohosh, and ginger root. The results were confirmed in a a dose-response study with HSs obtained from three suppliers for the four inhibitory HSs (green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, valerian root) and three representative noninhibitory HSs (black cohosh, black elderberry, echinacea). Similar results were obtained with the inhibitory HSs in CHE. The results illustrate that CHIM and CHE represent physiologically relevant in vitro experimental models for the evaluation of drug interaction potential of herbal supplements. Based on the results, green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, and valerian root may cause drug interactions with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates, as was observed for grapefruit juice. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In vitro evaluation of 29 popular herbal supplements in cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa identified green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, and valerian root to have CYP3A inhibitory potential similar to that for grapefruit juice, suggesting their potential to have clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates.

Our earlier studies have shown that specifically protein-bound dAGEs induce a pro-inflammatory reaction in human macrophage-like cells. To what extent these protein-bound dAGEs survive the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract is still unclear. In this study we analysed gastric and small intestinal digestion of dAGEs using the validated, standardised TNO in vitro gastroIntestinal digestion model (TIM-1), a dynamic in vitro model which mimics the upper human GI tract. This model takes multiple parameters into account, such as: dynamic pH curves, peristaltic mixing, addition of bile and pancreatic digestive enzymes, and passive absorption. Samples of different digested food products were collected at different time points after (i) only gastric digestion and (ii) after both gastric plus small intestinal digestion. Samples were analysed for dAGEs using UPLC-MS/MS for the lysine derived Nε-carboxymethyllysine (CML) and Nε-carboxyethyllysine (CEL), and the arginine derived methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone-1 (MG-H1), and glyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone-1 (G-H1). All AGEs were quantified in their protein-bound and free form. The results of this in vitro study show that protein-bound dAGEs survive gastrointestinal digestion and are additionally formed during small intestinal digestion. In ginger biscuits, the presence MG-H1 in the GI tract increased with more than 400%.

The effects of the AGC on spatial and recognition memory were examined using a Morris water maze and novel object recognition tasks. Rats induced with Aβ1-42 exhibited obvious cognitive deficits, as demonstrated by their increased escape latency time (ET) and decreased retention time (RT) and percentage of discriminative index (DI). When compared with the control group, all AGC-treated rats showed significantly shorter ETs and higher DIs during the 5-min delay testing phase. Rats treated with AGC250 also had significantly longer RTs.

The spectroscopy analysis, physical properties, microstructural, encapsulation efficiency and EO release behavior in obtained EO microparticles were evaluated by using the analysis of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. Afterwards, the above prepared microcapsules were applied on winter jujube fruit (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) preservation. Results demonstrated that both the microstructure and stability of microencapsulation were improved in delivery system loading with CH and CMC (1:1) with the encapsulation efficiency of 88.50%, compared to other ratios of CH and CMC (1:2 and 2:1). Furthermore, the microencapsulation had a capacity to control and reduce the EO release, therefore the morphological and sensory quality of jujube fruits in EO delivery system during storage was enhanced significantly (P < 0.05), in comparison to control. Results revealed that the microparticles produced with CH and CMC (1:1) was considered to present better characteristics of microstructure, encapsulation efficiency, as well as to maintain higher nutritional quality for jujube fruit. Thus, EO microencapsulation loaded in CH/CMC-based dual delivery system has potential application and developmental value prospects in food industries.",Food chemistry,"['D002214', 'D048271', 'D005638', 'D020939', 'D009822', 'D031957']","['Capsules', 'Chitosan', 'Fruit', 'Ginger', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Ziziphus']",Ginger essential oil-based microencapsulation as an efficient delivery system for the improvement of Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) fruit quality.,"['Q000032', 'Q000031', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analogs & derivatives', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629297,2019

The sample solution was then sonicated and filtered through a PTFE filter and analyzed under a linear gradient scheme instrument condition. A reverse-phase superficially porous particle C18 column and an absorption wavelength of 230 nm were used for analyte separation and determination. The method was demonstrated to be selective, linear (R2 > 0.999), specific, accurate (91.1-103.2% spike recovery rate), and precise (RSDr < 5%, RSDR < 8%) and therefore met all AOAC Standard Method Performance Requirements (2017.012) criteria.

However, the perceptual interactions that occur when complex odor mixtures are combined are not well understood. Here we used Gas chromatography-Recomposition-Olfactometry (GC-R) to better understand the role that individual compounds have on the perceived sensory aroma of bitters. Bitters are the concentrated alcoholic extract of flavorful plant materials with a wide range of complex sensory and chemical aroma profiles that have not been extensively studied. Previously, we demonstrated that Angostura bitters are characterized by complex aroma attributes described as cola, ginger, orange peel, and black pepper and that the volatile composition of Angostura bitters is predominantly composed of terpenoids. Using GC-R to create in-instrument mixtures of the Angostura headspace extracts, the sensory attributes of Angostura extracts with linalool, α-terpinyl-acetate and caryophyllene omitted were evaluated. The omission experiments demonstrated direct and indirect effects of the individual compounds on the aroma attributes of Angostura bitters, through masking, additive, and synergistic interactions. Caryophyllene in particular, which was present in the headspace extracts at concentration only slightly above sensory threshold levels, had a large and unexpected impact on the sensory properties of the mixtures and may be most responsible for the aromas associated with the whole sample.

For that, four single-stranded DNAs (named linker, trigger, H1 and H2, respectively) are rational designed and T-Hg-T mismatches duplex DNAs as a recognizer combined with the separation of magnetic beads. The design of hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification strategy assisted by magnetic separation has been adopted to improve the detection sensitivity. In the presence of pesticides, the amount of the thiol group generated by hydrolysis reaction of acetylcholine (ACh) is reduced, lead to release of less trigger DNA.

31038962,"The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a key regulator of innate immune responses, and its aberrant activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. Targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome could hold promise to combat these complex diseases, but therapies specifically inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome have not been developed for patient treatment. The current study aimed to identify food-borne exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs) that inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Nine vegetables or fruits were selected to extract ELNs, which were examined for their inhibitory effects on activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in primary macrophages. Although most of the tested ELNs posed minimal impacts, the ELNs from ginger rhizomes (G-ELNs) strongly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The G-ELNs contained lipids, proteins, and RNAs and were easily taken up by macrophages. G-ELN treatment suppressed pathways downstream of inflammasome activation including caspase1 autocleavage, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 secretion, and pyroptotic cell death. Apoptotic speck protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) oligomerization and speck formation assays indicated that G-ELNs blocked assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The lipids in G-ELNs, rather than the RNAs or proteins, were responsible for the inhibitory activity observed. Together, the data suggested G-ELNs as new potent agents that block NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. The unique features of G-ELNs including biomolecule protection and tissue bioavailability should facilitate the development of G-ELN-based therapy to target the NLRP3 inflammasome in the disease settings.",Molecular pharmaceutics,"['D000818', 'D002855', 'D055354', 'D020939', 'D015151', 'D058847', 'D008081', 'D051379', 'D008810', 'D000071199', 'D053758', 'D027343']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Exosomes', 'Ginger', 'Immunoblotting', 'Inflammasomes', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein', 'Nanoparticles', 'Rhizome']",Exosome-like Nanoparticles from Ginger Rhizomes Inhibited NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31038962,2020

However, reducing the particle size and thus interporous space, the capillary flow is substantially reduced. For the first time, optimizations led to the successful use of a layer made of mainly 4-μm irregular silica gel particles as stationary phase in planar chromatography. Layer thicknesses of 50 and 70 μm were studied to suit especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC). Along with it, the chromatographic fingerprint was miniaturized by 75%. The required development time and developing distance were reduced up to 50%. A typical 35-mm separation took less than 10 min. The limit of detection was improved by a factor of up to 3. Further chromatographic performance data, such as separation number (peak capacity), resolution and analytical response proved the suitability of the particulate UTLC layer. A direct transferability and miniaturization of established HPTLC methods to the UTLC dimension was aimed at. This was successfully demonstrated for eight quite different separations, i.e. food dyes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, steviol glycosides in cough drops and sweetener tablets, preservatives in shrimp-surimi salad, gingerol in ginger-containing products, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in honey, tanshinones in Salvia miltiorriza extracts and monacolin K in fermented red rice food supplements. The direct method transfer, mainstream usability and fast analyses at low running costs are crucial features of the developed UTLC plate. Profiting from such advantages, the miniaturized fingerprint shows potential to shift the field of HPTLC towards UTLC.

The results of both targeted and untargeted metabolite profiling revealed that peeling, drying in addition to storage employed during processing have a great influence on ginger chemo-profile, the different forms of processed ginger shouldn't be used interchangeably. Moreover, it deemed necessary to consider the holistic metabolic profile for comprehensive evaluation of ginger during processing.","Journal of chromatography.

Seven culinary spices including black pepper, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, ginger, Mediterranean oregano, rosemary, and turmeric were extracted with boiling water. Major chemical constituents were characterized by RP-HPLC-DAD method and antioxidant capacity was determined by measuring colorimetrically the extent to scavenge ABTS radical cations. Effects of spice extracts on the viability of 88 anaerobic and facultative isolates from intestinal microbiota were determined by using Brucella agar plates containing serial dilutions of extracts. A total of 14 phenolic compounds, a piperine, cinnamic acid, and cinnamaldehyde were identified and quantitated. Spice extracts exhibited high antioxidant capacity that correlated with the total amount of major chemicals. All spice extracts, with the exception of turmeric, enhanced the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. All spices exhibited inhibitory activity against selected Ruminococcus species. Cinnamon, oregano, and rosemary were active against selected Fusobacterium strains and cinnamon, rosemary, and turmeric were active against selected Clostridium spp. Some spices displayed prebiotic-like activity by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppressing the growth of pathogenic bacteria, suggesting their potential role in the regulation of intestinal microbiota and the enhancement of gastrointestinal health.

The major components were 10Hβ-9-oxo-agerophorone (37.03%), 10Hα-9-oxo-agerophorone (37.73%) and 9-oxo-10, 11-dehydro-agerophorone (23.41%).

In addition, the oil extracts greatly inhibited the formation of both wet and dry mycelial biomass. The combination of E. adenophorum oil extracts and synthetic fungicides showed a strong synergistic effect, inhibiting the mycelial growth in in vitro assays. The synergistic effect of oil extracts with fungicides could allow fungicides to be used at reduced rates in the future which has environmental advantages. Oil extracts applied at 160 and 200μg/ml concentrations to ginger rhizomes before inoculation with P. myriotylum significantly reduced the infection rate in ginger.

27166764,"Rhizoma Alpinia officinarum (Hance) Farw, Zingiberaceae (AO), a ginger family herb exhibiting stimulant and a carminative bioactivity, is widely used in European and Asian countries as spicy condiment and medicinal uses. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is the main pungent taste of native Wasabi (Wasabia japonica). The cytotoxicity of AITC has been implicated in thymus, adrenals, and white blood cells. Considering food safety, apparently a safer substitute for wasabi is worthy commercialized. Previously, we found AO crude paste to be rather feasible for use as a ""Wasabi-substitute"" in fresh meat and cold salads. A process linking cold ethyl acetate (EtAc) extraction with silica gel adsorption and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (mobile phase, 75% methanol) was used to isolate galangal acetate, the Wasabi-like taste constituent. AO contained abundant galangal acetate (3.84 ± 0.07%) compared to A. galangal (0.57 ± 0.16%), and as already confirmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS)/MS and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR), galangal acetate was particularly thermally labile. The steam distilled essential oil (SDEO) of AO (0.14% on wet basis) contained 80 compounds (number of component, %): monoterpene hydrocarbon (21, 13.83%); oxygenated monoterpene (17, 27.08%); sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (20, 31.03%), and oxygenated sesquiterpene (20, 21.85%), respectively. However, no spicy wasabi-like constituent remained in SDEO. Alternatively, n-hexane, EtAc, and methanol extracts of AO all showed potent DPPH- and superoxide anion-scavenging activity.

27040819,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced mostly by several species of Aspergillus and Penicillium. OTA is nephrotoxic in all animal species in which it has been tested and is cancerogenic in rodents. It is associated with Balkan endemic nephropathy. It is naturally present in many crop products such as cereals (barley, wheat, maize) and dried fruits, spices, coffee, wine, olives, and cocoa. The aim of this study was to assess the contamination of three Ivoirian spices with OTA (ginger, chili, and pepper) widely consumed by the population. A total of 90 spice samples (ginger: n = 30; chili: n = 30; pepper n = 30) was taken from various sales outlets of Abidjan. OTA was quantified using an HPLC apparatus coupled with a fluorimetric detector. The chili and ginger samples were contaminated with OTA at a mean concentration of 57.48 ± 174 and 0.12 ± 0.15 μg/kg, respectively. No contamination of the pepper samples was detected. Eight (26.67 %) of the chili samples exceeded the maximum limit of 15 μg/kg established by European regulation.

26492468,"Pesticides are of great importance in agricultural and biological fields, but pesticide residues may harm the environment and human health. A highly sensitive fluorescent biosensor for the detection of carbamate pesticide has been developed based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-catalyzed hydrolysis product triggered Hg(2+) release coupled with subsequent nicking enzyme-induced cleavage of a duplex DNA for cycling amplification. In this protocol, two DNA probes, an unmodified single-stranded helper DNA probe 1 (HP1) and a quencher-fluorophore probe (QFP) are ingeniously designed. HP1 can be folded into hairpin configuration through T-Hg(2+)-T base pair formation. QFP, labeled with FAM and BHQ1 at its two terminals, contains the recognition sequence and the cleavage site of the nicking enzyme. In the presence of carbamate pesticide, the activity of AChE is inhibited, and the amount of the product containing the thiol group generated by the hydrolysis reaction of acetylthiocholine chloride (ACh) decreases, resulting in the release of a low concentration of Hg(2+). The number of HP1 that can be selectively unfolded would be reduced and the subsequent nicking enzyme-assisted cleavage processes would be affected, resulting in decreased fluorescence signals. The fluorescence intensity further decreases with the increase of the pesticide concentration. Therefore, the pesticide content can be easily obtained by monitoring the fluorescence signal change, which is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the pesticide concentration. The detection limit of aldicarb, the model analyte, is 3.3 μgL(-1), which is much lower than the Chinese National Standards or those previously reported.

One question that needs to be asked, is whether CO2 enrichment affects the nutritional quality of Malaysian young ginger plants. Responses of total carbohydrate, fructose, glucose, sucrose, protein, soluble amino acids and antinutrients to either ambient (400 μmol/mol) and elevated (800 μmol/mol) CO2 treatments were determined in the leaf and rhizome of two ginger varieties namely Halia Bentong and Halia Bara. Increasing of CO2 level from ambient to elevated resulted in increased content of total carbohydrate, sucrose, glucose, and fructose in the leaf and rhizome of ginger varieties. Sucrose was the major sugar followed by glucose and fructose in the leaf and rhizome extract of both varieties. Elevated CO2 resulted in a reduction of total protein content in the leaf (H. Bentong: 38.0%; H. Bara: 35.4%) and rhizome (H. Bentong: 29.0%; H. Bara: 46.2%). In addition, under CO2 enrichment, the concentration of amino acids increased by approximately 14.5% and 98.9% in H. Bentong and 12.0% and 110.3% in H. Bara leaf and rhizome, respectively. The antinutrient contents (cyanide and tannin) except phytic acid were influenced significantly (P ≤ 0.05) by CO2 concentration. Leaf extract of H. Bara exposed to elevated CO2 exhibited highest content of cyanide (336.1 mg HCN/kg DW), while, highest content of tannin (27.5 g/kg DW) and phytic acid (54.1 g/kg DW) were recorded from H.Bara rhizome grown under elevated CO2.

24669707,"The raw extracts of six vegetables (tomato, green bean, shallot, broccoli, ginger and carrot) were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in full scan mode combined with NIST library search to confirm main matrix compounds. The effects of cleanup and adsorption mechanisms of primary secondary amine (PSA) , octadecylsilane (C18) and PSA + C18 on co-extractives were studied by the weight of evaporation residue for extracts before and after cleanup. The suitability of the two versions of QuEChERS method for sample preparation was evaluated for the extraction of 51 carbamate pesticides in the six vegetables. One of the QuEChERS methods was the original un-buffered method published in 2003, and the other was AOAC Official Method 2007.01 using acetate buffer. As a result, the best effects were obtained from using the combination of C18 and PSA for extract cleanup in vegetables. The acetate-buffered version was suitable for the determination of all pesticides except dioxacarb. Un-buffered QuEChERS method gave satisfactory results for determining dioxacarb. Based on these results, the suitable QuEChERS sample preparation method and liquid chromatography-positive electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry under the optimized conditions were applied to determine the 51 carbamate pesticide residues in six vegetables. The analytes were quantified by matrix-matched standard solution. The recoveries at three levels of 10, 20 and 100 microg/kg spiked in six vegetables ranged from 58.4% to 126% with the relative standard deviations of 3.3%-26%.

In this study, the effect of an aqueous-ethanolic extract of ginger on CYP450-mediated drug metabolism was investigated in vitro to elucidate the herb-drug interactions. A CYP450-specific substrates mixture was incubated with an aqueous-ethanolic extract of ginger in human liver microsomes fortified with an NADPH-generating system, and the metabolites generated from each of the CYP450-specific metabolic reactions were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The ginger extracts were tested at concentrations of 0.05-5 microg/mL. The resulting data showed that the ginger extract inhibited CYP2C19-mediated drug metabolism in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 3.8 microg/mL.

Ginger proteases, all with a molecular weight around 31 kDa, were found to exist in 3 forms with isoelectric point values around 5.58, 5.40, and 5.22, respectively. These enzymes had very similar biochemical behavior, exhibiting optimal proteolytic activity from 40 to 60 °C and maximum milk clotting activity at 70 °C. They were capable of hydrolyzing isolated α(S1)-, β-, and κ-casein, of which α(S1)-casein was most susceptible to the enzyme; κ-casein was hydrolyzed with a higher specificity than α(S1)- and β-casein. In addition, the ginger proteases exhibited a similar affinity for κ-casein and higher specificity with increasing temperature. Gel electrophoresis and mass spectra indicated that Ala90-Glu91 and His102-Leu103 of κ-casein were the preferred target bonds of ginger proteases.

Due to their importance in plants and human health, it would be useful to have a better understanding of flavonoid concentration and biological activities that could indicate their potentials as therapeutic agents, and also for predicting and controlling the quality of medicinal herbs. Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is a famous and widely used herb, especially in Asia, that contains several interesting bioactive constituents and possesses health promoting properties. In this study, total flavonoids and some flavonoid components including quercetin, rutin, catechin, epicatechin, kaempferol and naringenin were extracted from the leaves and rhizomes of two varieties of Zingiber officinale (Halia Bentong and Halia Bara) at three different growth points (8, 12 and 16 weeks after planting), and analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method in order to determine the potential of the subterranean part of the young ginger. The results showed that Halia Bara had a higher content of flavonoids in the leaves and rhizomes as compared to Halia Bentong. In both varieties, the concentration of flavonoids in the leaves decreased (Halia Bentong, 42.3%; Halia Bara 36.7%), and in the rhizomes it increased (Halia Bentong 59.6%; Halia Bara 60.1%) as the growth period increased. Quercetin was abundant in both varieties. The antioxidant activity determined by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay showed high activities (65.7%) in the leaves of Halia Bara at 8 weeks after planting.

The leaf and root of this plant are used for traditional wrapping of food and as a cooking substitute for fresh ginger. The aim of this work was to study the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extracts from A. pricei Hayata (EEAP) and its phenolic compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profiling indicated that EEAP contained caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, rutin, apigenin, curcumin and pinocembrin. EEAP and its phenolic compounds, apigenin, curcumin, and pinocembrin, inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, EEAP, apigenin, curcumin, and pinocembrin decreased LPS-mediated induction of protein and mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, EEAP and its major active compound pinocembrin inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and NF-kappaB-mediated reporter gene expression. EEAP and pinocembrin also significantly inhibited LPS-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in RAW 264.7 cells.

18924735,"The concentrations of mercury in forty, commercially available dietary supplements, were determined using a new, inexpensive analysis technique. The method involves thermal decomposition, amalgamation, and detection of mercury by atomic absorption spectrometry with an analysis time of approximately six minutes per sample. The primary cost savings from this approach is that labor-intensive sample digestion is not required prior to analysis, further automating the analytical procedure. As a result, manufacturers and regulatory agencies concerned with monitoring lot-to-lot product quality may find this approach an attractive alternative to the more classical acid-decomposition, cold vapor atomic absorption methodology. Dietary supplement samples analyzed included astragalus, calcium, chromium picolinate, echinacea, ephedra, fish oil, ginger, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, goldenseal, guggul, senna, St John's wort, and yohimbe products. Quality control samples analyzed with the dietary supplements indicated a high level of method accuracy and precision. Ten replicate preparations of a standard reference material (NIST 1573a, tomato leaves) were analyzed, and the average mercury recovery was 109% (2.0% RSD). The method quantitation limit was 0.3 ng, which corresponded to 1.5 ng/g sample. The highest found mercury concentration (123 ng/g) was measured in a concentrated salmon oil sample.

Oleoresin was extracted using sinkhole distillation technique. Its components namely, gingerol in fraction-1, shogaol in fraction 2 and zingeron in fraction-3 were separated by column vacuum chromatography method. The doses of oleoresin, gingerol, shogaol, and zingeron tested were 50, 100,150, 200, and 250 μg/ml. Lymphocytes (2x106 cell/ml) from human peripheral blood were isolated using ficoll density gradient technique, and cultured in the presence of the compounds in RPMI-1640 medium and phytohemaglutinin (PHA) mitogen for 96 h under normal conditions. Percentages of T-cell surface molecules (CD4+ and CD8+) were determined using dual-tagging FITC and PE fluorescents labeled on monoclonal antibody anti human. The fluorescence-labeled bands on the T-cell surface molecules were counted using flow cytometer. The experiment revealed that oleoresin and its three fractions increased the percentage of CD3+CD4+. The compound in fraction 3 of oleoresin at 200 μg/ml increased by the highest percentage of CD3+CD4+ of 9%, but slightly decreased the percentage of CD3+CD8+. These ginger bioactive compounds increased the ratio of CD3+CD4:CD3+CD8+ T-cells with the highest increment of 30% from effects of 200 μg/ml fraction 3 of oleoresin.

Methanol extracts of rhizomes from three different sources were used for HPTLC, n-hexane, and diethyl ether (40:60 v/v) as the mobile phase. The Rf of 6-gingerol was found to be 0.40. The calibration plot was linear in the range of 250-1200 ng of 6-gingerol and the correlation coefficient of 0.9997 was indicative of good linear dependence of peak area on concentration. The mean quantity of 6-gingerol was found to be 60.44+/-2.53 mg/g of ginger extract. The method permits reliable quantification of 6-gingerol and good resolution and separation of 6-gingerol from other constituents of ginger. To study the accuracy and precision of the method, recovery studies were performed by the method of standard addition. Recovery values from 99.79 to 99.84% showed the excellent reliability and reproducibility of the method.

16963091,"Ginger is an important medicinal and culinary herb, known worldwide for its health promoting properties. Because ginger does not reproduce by seed, but is clonally propagated via rhizome division and replanting, it is susceptible to accumulation and transmittance of pathogens from generation to generation. In addition, such propagation techniques lead to slow multiplication of particularly useful stocks. We have developed an in vitro propagation method to alleviate these problems. Metabolic profiling, using GC/MS and LC-ESI-MS, was used to determine if chemical differences existed between greenhouse grown or in vitro micropropagation derived plants. Three different ginger lines were analyzed. The constituent gingerols and gingerol-related compounds, other diarylheptanoids, and methyl ether derivatives of these compounds, as well as major mono- and sesquiterpenoids were identified. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed chemical differences between lines (yellow ginger vs. white ginger and blue ring ginger) and tissues (rhizome, root, leaf and shoot). However, this analysis indicated that no significant differences existed between growth treatments (conventional greenhouse grown vs. in vitro propagation derived plants). Further statistical analyses (ANOVA) confirmed these results.

16792061,"Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by certain molds and are common contaminants of many important food crops, such as grains, nuts, and spices. Some mycotoxins are found in fruits, vegetables, and botanical roots. These contaminants have a broad range of toxic effects, including carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive and developmental toxicity. The public health concerns related to both acute and chronic effects of mycotoxins in animals have prompted more than 100 countries to establish regulatory limits for some of the well-known mycotoxins, such as the aflatoxins (AFL). Our research focused on method development for 2 of these toxins, AFL and ochratoxin A (OTA), in ginseng and other selected botanical roots. Methods using an immunoaffinity column (IAC) cleanup, liquid chromatographic separation, and fluorescence detection were modified and evaluated. Two types of IAC cleanup were evaluated: IAC for AFL, and IAC for both AFL and OTA. Three derivatization techniques to enhance the fluorescence of the AFL were compared: precolumn trifluoroacetic acid, postcolumn bromination, and postcolumn ultraviolet irradiation. No derivatization was needed for OTA. Results for AFL using the single analyte IAC cleanup and the 3 derivatization techniques were all comparable for ginseng and for other roots such as ginger, licorice, and kava-kava. Recoveries of added AFL for ginseng at levels from 2 to 16 ng/g were about 80%. Using IAC cleanup for both AFL and OTA recoveries of added AFL for ginseng at 4-16 ng/g were about 70%, and for ginger, licorice, and kava-kava were about 60%.

However, analysis of commercial products has shown that the highest levels of acrylamide are seen in dry biscuit type products. With the exception of spiced products such as ginger cake, moist high sugar products (e.g. cakes and fruit loaves) show relatively low levels of acrylamide, even in darkly browned crusts. This is in contrast to bread where acrylamide levels in excess of 100 microg/kg are common in the crust region, but are diluted by low levels in the crumb. Acrylamide levels in bread are significantly raised by domestic toasting, but other products such as crumpets and Naan bread have been found to be less sensitive.

We report here the hypotensive, endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilator and cardio-suppressant and stimulant effects of its aqueous extract (Zo.Cr). Zo.Cr, which tested positive for saponins, flavonoids, amines, alkaloids and terpenoids, induced a dose-dependent (3.0-10.0 mg/kg) fall in the arterial blood pressure (BP) of anaesthetized rats which was partially blocked by atropine (1 mg/kg). In isolated endothelium-intact rat aorta, Zo.Cr (0.01-5.0 mg/ml) relaxed the phenylephrine (1 microM)-induced contractions, effect partially blocked by atropine (1 microM). Zo.Cr inhibited the K+ (80 mM)-induced contractions and also shifted the Ca++ dose-response curves to the right, similar to verapamil, indicating Ca++ antagonist activity. An atropine-resistant and l-NAME-sensitive vasodilator activity was also noted from ginger phenolic constituents 6-, 8- and 10-gingerol, while 6-shogaol showed a mild vasodilator effect. In guinea-pig atria, Zo.Cr (0.1-5.0 mg/ml) inhibited the force and rate of atrial contractions. Pretreatment with atropine blocked the inhibitory effect and a stimulatory effect was unmasked which was resistant to propranolol and verapamil but sensitive to ryanodine, blocker of Ca++ release from intracellular stores. Later at doses >or=1.0 mg/ml, the extract completely suppressed the atrial tissue, effect resistant to glibenclamide, pyrilamine, aminophylline and L-NAME.

The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) << MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase. The atmosphere generated from the EOs was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry.

15478995,"Ginger is widely used as either a food product or an herbal medicine in the world. In this paper, a method was developed for determining volatile components in essential oils from both dried and fresh ginger by use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and chemometric approaches. With the resolution improvement by chemometric methods upon two-dimensional data from GC-MS, the drifting baseline can be corrected. In addition, the peak purity can be assessed and the number of chemical components and their stepwise elution in the peak clusters can be identified. The peak clusters investigated are then resolved into pure chromatograms and related mass spectra for each of the components involved. Finally, with the pure chromatograms and related mass spectra obtained, the chemical components can be qualitatively identified based on the similarity searches in the MS databases and the chromatographic retention times. Quantitative determination can be conducted using the overall volume integration approach. The results showed that 140 and 136 components were separated and that 74 and 75 of them were tentatively identified, which accounted for about 62.82 and 47.11% of the total relative content for dried and fresh ginger, respectively. In comparison with the chromatographic fingerprints of essential oils from dried and fresh ginger, 60 of the volatile components determined match with each other.

9467788,"Safrole was determined using gas-liquid chromatography in some common spices as star anise, cumin, black pepper and ginger. Safrole concentration in these spices was 9,325, 3,432, 955 and 500 mg.kg-1, respectively. Black pepper was chosen to use in the following experiments. Using Ames-test with Salmonella TA 98 and TA 100 proved high cytotoxic effects due to pure safrole and black pepper volatile oil in both of them. The degradation of safrole was obvious after drying of the washed seeds of black pepper especially at 70 degrees C for 30 min or with sun-drying. Also, high irradiation doses (20 and 30 kGy) caused high degradation of more than 90% of the initial toxic concentration in black pepper. Whereas, microwave caused same effects at 75 s, but unfortunately, the powder was burned due to moisture absence. Boiling whole seeds or powder of black pepper during cooking for few minutes (1-5 min) were more efficient in decreasing safrole content. Finally, these results proved that the mutagenicity of some spices due to presence of safrole can be destructed during drying of the washed seeds or during cooking either with or without any additional treatment as irradiation. But irradiation of these species became more necessary for using in some food industries as milk products to get more safe for human consumption.",Die Nahrung,"['D002849', 'D003296', 'D005504', 'D008872', 'D009152', 'D009153', 'D012451', 'D017365']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Cooking', 'Food Analysis', 'Microwaves', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens', 'Safrole', 'Spices']",Degradation of the natural mutagenic compound safrole in spices by cooking and irradiation.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9467788,1998
8885323,"A survey has been carried out in the UK to determine the levels of mycotoxins in a range of ethnic foods. The survey involved analysis of 121 samples of ethnic foods, purchased from specialist shops, for aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and the Fusarium mycotoxins (fumonisins, zearalenone and trichothecenes). The samples were of cereal and cereal product, fats and oils, nuts and nut products, seeds, spices and herbs, pickles, sauces and a variety of canned vegetable and/or pickle products. Low concentrations of mycotoxins were present in many samples analysed. The types and levels of mycotoxins present varied with the type of sample. The most common contaminants were the trichothecenes and ochratoxin A. Trace levels of aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, fumonisins and trichothecenes were detected in samples containing cereal, such as rice, noodles, corn flour and pitta bread. Trace levels of aflatoxins and zearalenone were detected in a sample of chili oil and ochratoxin A in a sample of sesame oil. Only one sample of nut (almond) contained aflatoxin while aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol (a trichothecene) were detected in various seeds. Aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and fumonisins were found in chili paste and zearalenone and ochratoxin A in curry pastes.

7483863,"Spices from Egyptian local markets were irradiated with different recommended doses (0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 kGy). The spices tested included dried leaves of marjoram (Majorana hortensis Moench), rhizomes of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) and powdered hot pepper (Capsicum annum L.). The study included the isolation and identification of micro-organisms in spices following their irradiation, as well as gas chromatographic (GLC) chemical analysis for the presence and structure of volatile oils, pungent and pigment materials. The results showed that hot pepper was contaminated more (9.2 x 10(5)/g) than marjoram (4.2 x 10(3)/g) and ginger (14.3 x 10(3)/g) with respect to total aerobic bacterial content. The total contents of moulds were 4.8 x 10(3)/g, 5.7 x 10(3)/g and 19 x 10(3)/g in the same spices, respectively, but the pathogenic moulds and bacterial strains differed according to the type of spice. Irradiation at 10, 20 and 30 kGy caused complete elimination of micro-organisms, whereas 5 kGy was less effective. With the GLC method chosen 18 and 50 compounds could be detected in the extracts of marjoram and ginger, respectively; gamma-terpinen and zingiberen being the major compounds in marjoram and ginger, respectively. A noticeable reduction was observed in the amount of terpenes present in irradiated marjoram; they were converted to monoterpenesalcohols. Ginger was more sensitive to irradiation, especially at high doses, but moderate changes were detected at low doses (5 and 10 kGy). A slight, but significant effect on the capsaicin (pungent compound) in hot-pepper was observed following irradiation, whereas no changes in total pigments resulted at any dose. These results prove that 10 kGy is a sufficiently high dose to eliminate the micro-organisms in spices, causing only slight changes in the flavouring materials.",Zeitschrift fur Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung,"['D002212', 'D002849', 'D005514', 'D005516', 'D005658', 'D006090', 'D006094', 'D019684', 'D010946', 'D017365', 'D013649']","['Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Food Irradiation', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fungi', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Magnoliopsida', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Spices', 'Taste']",Effect of irradiation on the microbiological status and flavouring materials of selected spices.,"[None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000302', 'Q000302', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000382', None]","[None, 'methods', None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', 'microbiology', None, 'microbiology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7483863,1995

3103137,"Aqueous ginger extract was extracted in three organic solvents viz., n-hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate with increasing polarity. The extracted materials from these solvents reduced platelet thromboxane formation from exogenous arachidonate (AA) and also inhibited platelet aggregation induced by AA, epinephrine, ADP and collagen; in this respect they were most effective against AA-induced aggregation. The extracted material in n-hexane was further resolved by thin-layer chromatography into various fractions some of which were effective in inhibiting platelet thromboxane formation and platelet aggregation. Aqueous ginger extract reduced the formation of TxB2 from AA-labelled platelets without showing effects on platelet phospholipase activity. Thromboxane formation in labelled platelets on activation with calcium ionophore A23187 was reduced by ginger components, isolated from two TLC bands, in a dose-dependent manner (10-100 ug/500 ml).

Twelve partially purified, dry film extracts from naturally and artificially contaminated roasted peanuts, cottonseed, and ginger root containing varying quantities of aflatoxin B1 were distributed to the participating laboratories. The extracts required additional cleanup before MS analysis, using either an acidic alumina column and preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) or a 2-dimensional TLC procedure. Recovery of purified aflatoxin B1 was influenced by the degree of recovery of sample from acid alumina and/or the TLC plate and incomplete elution of aflatoxin B1 from silica gel.

7049579,"Ginger is used in more ways than any other spice. This monograph, published in two parts, comprehensively reviews production, trade, processing, chemistry, and evaluation of quality. Botany, world varieties, agronomy, crop improvement and potential are reviewed briefly with emphasis on the yield of functional components. Processing for the market, international trade patterns, and factors influencing them are discussed. Derived products such as ginger powder, syruped ginger, volatile oil, and oleoresin are discussed in greater detail. The increasing world demand for quality products of added value such as the oleoresin and volatile oil show prospects for their production in the growing countries. The chemistry of the components which contribute aroma and pungency that characterize ginger is critically reviewed. The second part deals with evaluation of quality. The physico-chemical parameters prescribed as a measure of quality for ginger and its products in the existing standards can assure only hygienic quality and purity, and possibly the source, when new parameters such as GC-fingerprints are included. The importance of sensorily evaluating flavor quality is emphasized to understand the variation in flavor quality required by the industrial and retail markets. Related areas, such as problems in sensory evaluation of intense flavored substances, objective flavor profile analysis, and correlation of instrumental and sensory data, are discussed and our recent work in this area is summarized. Areas where more research are needed are indicated. Other areas briefly discussed are functional, physiological, and toxicological properties in use of ginger; biosynthetic aspects of the components stimulating flavor; and structure and pungency and chemistry of spices from allied species and genera.
