34536781,"Advances in Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization -Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) have led to its supremacy for complex assessment of food authenticity studies, like dairy products fraud, holding promise for the discovery of potential authenticity (bio)markers. In this study, an integrated untargeted protein-based workflow in combination with advanced chemometrics is presented, to address authenticity challenges in PDO feta cheese which is legally manufactured by the mixture of sheep/goat milk. Potential markers attributed to specific animal origin were found from protein profiles acquired for authentic feta and white cheeses (prepared from cow milk), belonging to 4 kDa-18.5 kDa mass area. Rapid detection of feta cheese adulteration from cow milk was also achieved down to 1% adulteration level.

34295935,"Chinese dairy industries have developed rapidly, providing consumers with high-quality sources of nutrition. However, many problems have also appeared during the development process, especially the low quality of milk. To improve milk quality, a large amount of concentrated feed is usually added to the diet within a certain period of time, which increases the milk production to a certain extent. However, long-term feeding with high-concentration feed can lead to subacute rumen acidosis. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the effect of adding a buffer on subacute rumen acidosis, and the improvement of milk production and milk quality. We also aimed to study the mechanism of promoting mammary gland lactation. A total of 12 healthy mid-lactating goats were randomly divided into two groups, they were high-grain diet group (Control) and buffering agent group. To understand the effects of high-grain diets with buffers on amino acids in jugular blood and the effects of amino acids on milk protein synthesis, Milk-Testing™ Milkoscan 4000, commercial kits, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements were integrated with the milk protein rate, the amino acid concentration in jugular venous blood samples, quantitative real-time PCR, comparative proteomics, and western blotting to study differentially expressed proteins and amino acids in mammary gland tissues of goats fed high-grain diets. Feeding lactating goats with buffering agent increased the percentage of milk protein in milk, significantly increased the amino acid content of jugular blood (",Frontiers in veterinary science,[],[],Effects of a High-Grain Diet With a Buffering Agent on Milk Protein Synthesis in Lactating Goats.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34295935,2021
34068704,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are exogenous substances capable of altering the human hormone system and causing various diseases such as infertility and cancer as a result. In this work, a method for determining twenty-three different EDCs including parabens, alkylphenols, phenylphenols, organophosphorus pesticides, bisphenol A and triclosan in dairy products was developed. Samples are conditioned by addition of acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid, centrifugation and clean-up of the extract by continuous solid-phase extraction. EDCs in the extract are derivatised by heating in a microwave oven and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The proposed method features good limits of detection (6-40 ng/kg) and precision (relative standard deviation < 7.6%); also, it is scarcely subject to matrix effects (1-20%). EDC recoveries from spiked samples ranged from 80 to 108%. The method was used to analyse a total of 33 samples of dairy products including cow, sheep and goat milk, yoghourt, milkshakes, cheese, cream, butter and custard. Bisphenol A was the individual contaminant detected in the greatest number of samples, at concentrations from 180 to 4800 ng/kg. 2-Phenylphenol and ethylparaben were found in more than one-half, at concentrations over the range 130-3500 and 89-4300 ng/kg, respectively.

33497872,"A multi-channel magnetic bead micro-probes assay (MBPA) based on indirect competitive principle was developed for high-throughput detection of zearalenone (ZEA) in edible and medicinal Coix seed. This strategy introduced magnetic beads as the carriers, the specific primary antibodies as the capture probes for targets and the secondary antibodies functionalized goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G labeled fluorescein isothiocyanate as the fluorescence signal probes. Through the competitive reaction of ZEA in Coix seed samples and that covalently coupled on the surface of MBs with their specific antibodies, as well as fast magnetic separation and sensitive fluorescence detection, the developed MBPA strategy allowed low limit of detection (2.03 ng/mL) with broad dynamic range (2.03-440.67 ng/mL), as well as excellent accuracy with the average recovery rate of 96.39% and relative standard deviation (RSD) of 5.48% for ZEA. 36 samples could realize simultaneous analysis in one operation within less than 20 min only needing 50 μL of solution and 30 s of sampling, avoiding large consumption of time and organic solvents. Multiple centrifugation and cleanup steps were omitted because of magnetic separation, avoiding the loss of targets.

33138259,"Tryptophan (TRP) is an essential amino acid which cannot be synthesized by humans and animals, but has to be supplied by exogenous sources, notably through the diet. The bulk of dietary TRP flows into the synthesis of body's proteins, but the TRP metabolism also involves several biochemical reactions (i.e., serotonin and kynurenine pathways). Defects in the TRP transport mechanism or catabolism are related to a large number of clinical abnormalities. Therefore, dietary TRP intake is necessary not only for the body's growth but also for most of the body's metabolic functions. Among protein-based foods, milk proteins provide a relatively high amount of TRP. In this paper, a rapid chromatographic method for TRP determination in yoghurt, by ultra high performance liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column with fluorescence detection (280 nm Ex; 360 nm Em), is provided. A linear gradient elution of acetonitrile in water allowed TRP analysis in 8.0 min. The limit of detection and limit of quantification of the method were 0.011 ng/µL and 0.029 ng/µL, respectively, using 5-methyl-l-tryptophan as the internal standard.

33131819,"Today, cheese is valued because of its high nutritional value and unique characteristics. Improving the texture and flavor of cheese by selecting suitable starter cultures is an important way to promote the development of cheese industry. The effect of starter cultures on the physicochemical and textural properties and volatile compounds during the ripening of semihard goat cheese were investigated in this work. Different starter cultures-mesophilic (M) and thermophilic starters (T), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum ATCC 14917 (Lp), a mix of the M and T starters (M1), and mix of the M, T, and Lp starters (M2)-were used in the production of the goat cheeses. Volatile compounds were determined by a solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (SPME/GC-MS) method. The results showed that the moisture content of cheeses produced with the 5 kinds of starter cultures decreased after maturation, whereas ash content increased. The pH values of goat cheeses decreased first and then increased during maturity, and the pH value of M2 cheese was the lowest among the cheeses. The hardness and chewiness of the cheeses increased with increasing maturity, whereas cohesiveness, springiness, and resilience showed the opposite tendency. The 60-d-old cheese made with Lp had the highest chewiness, cohesiveness, springiness, and resilience, whereas the 60-d-old cheese made with M2 had the highest hardness. A total of 53 volatile components were identified by SPME/GC-MS, and carboxylic acids, alcohols, ketones, and esters were the 4 major contributors to the characteristic flavors of the cheeses. Volatile components and their contents differed greatly among the produced cheeses. The M2 cheese contained the highest relative content of the main volatile compounds (90.10%), especially butanoic acid and acetoin. Through a comprehensive comparison of the results, we concluded that M2 cheese had a dense texture and milky flavor, and M2 is a potential starter culture candidate for the production of goat cheese.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D055598', 'D005285', 'D005511', 'D006041', 'D048668', 'D048191', 'D017045', 'D013294', 'D012677', 'D052617', 'D048249', 'D013649', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Fermentation', 'Food Handling', 'Goats', 'Lactobacillus delbrueckii', 'Lactobacillus plantarum', 'Lactococcus', 'Lactococcus lactis', 'Sensation', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Streptococcus thermophilus', 'Taste', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Physicochemical and textural characteristics and volatile compounds of semihard goat cheese as affected by starter cultures.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000662', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'methods', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'veterinary', 'metabolism', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33131819,2021

A control group was fed with a standard commercial diet while the experimental group received a standard commercial diet plus sheep/goat whey protein for 28 days. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was conducted to determine plasma amino acid levels while the expression of p70-S6 Kinase 1 (p70-S6K1) in liver and quadriceps muscles was quantified and used as a biomarker of mTOR activity. The results obtained showed a decrease in the levels of essential and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in the experimental group. Furthermore, p70-S6K1 expression was decreased in the liver of rats consumed whey protein. In conclusion, the reduction of amino acid levels and the concomitant inactivation of mTOR imply that whey could potentially act protectively against disorders induced by mTOR overactivation.

29785912,"The hypothesis of this research paper was that the physicochemical conditions in a low-pH, high-moisture white brined cheese such as Feta would make para-κ-casein vulnerable to residual chymosin activity during ripening and storage. It was important to address this hypothesis, since cheese para-κ-casein could theoretically be used for the assessment of the origin of cheese milk by means of various analytical methods. Feta cheese was manufactured from sheep milk and from four different mixtures of sheep and goat milk in triplicate. The para-κ-casein of Feta samples taken during 120 d of ripening and storage was estimated by means of cation-exchange HPLC and proteolysis was determined in terms of free amino groups. Despite their similarity, sheep and goat para-κ-casein were efficiently separated and the changes of their chromatographic areas indicated that hydrolysis took place during the first stage of ripening. In accordance to the evolution of free amino groups, para-κ-caseins remained stable thereafter. The hydrolysis pattern was not affected by the composition of the cheese milk mixture and after 120 d at least two thirds of the initial quantity remained intact. Considering the efficient separation of sheep and goat para-κ-caseins and their stability during Feta storage, the same method was used for the evaluation of the percentage of goat milk in the cheese milk. The actual and the estimated percentage of goat milk within the range 0-40 were strongly correlated (R = 0·997, n = 60) and the standard error of estimation was 0·914.",The Journal of dairy research,"['D000818', 'D002364', 'D002611', 'D055598', 'D002851', 'D005511', 'D006041', 'D006863', 'D006868', 'D008892', 'D012756', 'D014867']","['Animals', 'Caseins', 'Cheese', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Handling', 'Goats', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis', 'Milk', 'Sheep', 'Water']","Para-κ-casein during the ripening and storage of low-pH, high-moisture Feta cheese.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29785912,2018

29324088,"For many years, the adulteration of milk from sheep, goats or water buffalos with cows' milk has been a widespread practice due to the higher cost of milk from those other species. Because of this, great concern has been shown by many Protected Designation of Origin councils that have to assure the quality and genuineness of the cheese produced by their associates. Therefore, the whole production chain needs analytical tools that allow the control of potential adulteration. Rapid methods to be used in the field are scarce and have not been validated according to international guidelines. The aim of this work has been to validate a rapid test based on lateral flow immunochromatography to detect cows' milk in milk from other species, including buffalo's milk, according to AOAC guidelines. No false-positive result was found after analysing 146 known negative samples from individual animals. The lowest level of adulteration with a Probability of Detection (POD) of 1.00 (confidence interval between 0.94 and 1.00) was found at 0.5% of cows' milk. This level is below the current EU allowed level of cows' milk, set at 1%. Variations in the time of assay, volume of the analysis buffer and different batches of the test were evaluated to detect any effect on the false-positive rate or on the limit of detection of the test. The effects of compositional factors (such as high level of fat, protein and somatic cell counts) were also evaluated. The new rapid test to detect cows' milk in milk from other species is shown to be an adequate tool to control milk quality in routine analysis. This kind of test is very easy to use and it can be performed by untrained staff during milk collection at the farm or upon arrival at dairies.","Food additives & contaminants.

Selling and buying human milk via the Internet has gained popularity. However, there is a risk of human milk sold containing other adulterants such as animal or plant milk. Analytical tools for rapid detection of adulterants in human milk are needed. We report a quantitative metabolomics method for detecting potential milk adulterants (soy, almond, cow, goat and infant formula milk) in human milk. It is based on the use of a high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS platform to profile the metabolome of an unknown milk sample, followed by multivariate or univariate comparison of the resultant metabolomic profile with that of human milk to determine the differences. Using dansylation LC-MS to profile the amine/phenol submetabolome, we could detect an average of 4129 ± 297 (n = 9) soy metabolites, 3080 ± 470 (n = 9) almond metabolites, 4256 ± 136 (n = 18) cow metabolites, 4318 ± 198 (n = 9) goat metabolites, 4444 ± 563 (n = 9) infant formula metabolites, and 4020 ± 375 (n = 30) human metabolites. This high level of coverage allowed us to readily differentiate the six different types of samples. From the analysis of binary mixtures of human milk containing 5, 10, 25, 50 and 75% other type of milk, we demonstrated that this method could be used to detect the presence of as low as 5% adulterant in human milk.

In free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, CPL plays important roles in embryogenesis and development processes. The CPL protein is also believed to have a role in degradation of blood meal in the gut of parasitic nematodes. Considering this enzyme might play the same functions in parasitic nematodes, CPL became a potential candidate for vaccination against Haemonchus contortus, a gastrointestinal nematode of small ruminants. H. contortus has been shown to have variations in term of morphology and genetic materials that correlated with different hosts and geographical areas. These variations could hinder the development of effective vaccines. Thus, the present study was conducted to clone and characterize recombinant Hc-CPL-1 from H. contortus isolated from a goat population in Penang, Malaysia. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify target complimentary DNA (cDNA) from total RNA and protein expression using Escherichia coli expression system was performed from constructed cDNA clone library. The identity of each protein band was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis followed by De novo sequencing and database matching. The protein structure and its evolutionary relationship were also studied using several bioinformatics approaches. Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) analysis of the strain retrieved from clone library showed 99% sequence similarity to the Haemonchus cathepsin L cysteine protease and a 47 kDA protein was successfully expressed. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that this protease has a close relationship with Dv-CPL-1, Sv-CPL-1 and Ce-CPL-1.

29085985,"There is an urgent need for the rapid and simultaneous detection of multiple analytes present in a sample matrix. Here, a multiplex immunochromatographic test (multi-ICT) was developed that successfully allowed for the rapid and simultaneous detection of four major nitrofuran metabolites, i.e., 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ), semicarbazide (SEM), 3-amino-5-methylmorpholino-2-oxazolidinone (AMOZ), and 1-aminohydantoin (AHD), in fish samples. Four different antigens were separately immobilized in four test lines on a nitrocellulose membrane. Goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (IgG) was used as a control. Sensitive and specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize the corresponding antigens were selected for the assay, and no cross-reactivity between the antibodies in the detection assay was observed. The free analytes in samples or standards were pre-incubated with freeze-dried mAb-gold conjugates to improve the sensitivity of the detection assay. The multi-ICT detection was accomplished in less than 15 min by the naked eye. The cutoff values for the strip test were 0.5 ng/mL for AOZ and 0.75 ng/mL for AHD, SEM, and AMOZ, which were all below the maximum residue levels set by the European Union and China.

26675863,"Ricotta cheese is a typical Italian product, made with whey from various species, including cow, buffalo, sheep, and goat. Ricotta cheese nominally manufactured from the last three species may be fraudulently produced using the comparatively cheaper cow whey. Exposing such food frauds requires a reliable analytical method. Despite the extensive similarities shared by whey proteins of the four species, a mass spectrometry-based analytical method was developed that exploits three species-specific peptides derived from β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin. This method can detect as little as 0.5% bovine whey in ricotta cheese from the other three species. Furthermore, a tight correlation was found (R(2)>0.99) between cow whey percentages and mass spectrometry measurements throughout the 1-50% range. Thus, this method can be used for forensic detection of ricotta cheese adulteration and, if properly validated, to provide quantitative evaluations.

26601590,"Direct comparison of cow and goat performance and milk fatty acid responses to diets known to induce milk fat depression (MFD) in the bovine reveals relevant species-by-diet interactions in ruminal lipid metabolism. Thus, this study was conducted to infer potential mechanisms responsible for differences in the rumen microbial biohydrogenation (BH) due to diet and ruminant species. To meet this objective, 12 cows and 15 goats were fed a basal diet (control), a similar diet supplemented with 2.2% fish oil (FO), or a diet containing 5.3% sunflower oil and additional starch (+38%; SOS) according to a 3 × 3 Latin square design with 25-d experimental periods. On the last day of each period, fatty acid composition (by gas chromatography) and bacterial community (by terminal-RFLP), as well as fermentation characteristics, were measured in rumen fluid samples. Results showed significant differences in the response of cows and goats to dietary treatments, although variations in some fermentation parameters (e.g., decreases in the acetate-to-propionate ratio due to FO or SOS) were similar in both species. Main alterations in ruminal BH pathways potentially responsible for MFD on the SOS diet (i.e., the shift from trans-11 to trans-10 18:1 and related increases in trans-10,cis-12 18:2) tended to be more pronounced in cows, which is consistent with an associated MFD only in this species. However, changes linked to FO-induced MFD (e.g., decreases in 18:0 and increases in total trans-18:1) were stronger in caprine rumen fluid, which may explain their unexpected susceptibility (although less marked than in bovine) to the negative effect of FO on milk fat content. Altogether, these results suggest that distinct ruminal mechanisms lead to each type of diet-induced MFD and confirm a pronounced interaction with species. With regard to microbiota, differences between cows and goats in the composition of the rumen bacterial community might be behind the disparity in the microorganisms affected by the experimental diets (e.g., Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Succinivibrionaceae in the bovine, and Pseudobutryrivibrio, Clostridium cluster IV, Prevotella, and Veillonellaceae in the caprine), which hindered the assignation of bacterial populations to particular BH steps or pathways. Furthermore, most relevant variations in microbial groups corresponded to as yet uncultured bacteria and suggest that these microorganisms may play a predominant role in the ruminal lipid metabolism in both cows and goats.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D004032', 'D004042', 'D019587', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D005395', 'D006041', 'D050356', 'D008892', 'D010938', 'D012417', 'D013213', 'D000074242']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Fish Oils', 'Goats', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Milk', 'Plant Oils', 'Rumen', 'Starch', 'Sunflower Oil']","Comparison of ruminal lipid metabolism in dairy cows and goats fed diets supplemented with starch, plant oil, or fish oil.","[None, 'Q000502', 'Q000662', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None]","[None, 'physiology', 'veterinary', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26601590,2016
26589945,"This study reports a fast and automated analytical procedure for the analysis of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk and dairy products. The method is based on the simultaneous protein precipitation and AFM1 extraction, by salt-induced liquid-liquid extraction (SI-LLE), followed by an online solid-phase extraction (online SPE) coupled to ultra-high-pressure-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis to the automatic pre-concentration, clean up and sensitive and selective determination of AFM1. The main parameters affecting the extraction efficiency and accuracy of the analytical method were studied in detail. In the optimal conditions, acetonitrile and NaCl were used as extraction/denaturant solvent and salting-out agent in SI-LLE, respectively. After centrifugation, the organic phase (acetonitrile) was diluted with water (1:9 v/v) and purified (1mL) by online C18 cartridge coupled with an UHPLC column. Finally, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition mode was applied to the detection of AFM1. Validation studies were carried out on different dairy products (whole and skimmed cow milk, yogurt, goat milk, and powder infant formula), providing method quantification limits about 25 times lower than AFM1 maximum levels permitted by EU regulation 1881/2006 in milk and dairy products for direct human consumption. Recoveries (86-102%) and repeatability (RSD<3, n=6) meet the performance criteria required by EU regulation N. 401/2006 for the determination of the levels of mycotoxins in foodstuffs. Moreover, no matrix effects were observed in the different milk and dairy products studied. The proposed method improves the performance of AFM1 analysis in milk samples as AFM1 determination is performed with a degree of accuracy higher than the conventional methods. Other advantages are the reduction of sample preparation procedure, time and cost of the analysis, enabling high sample throughput that meet the current concerns of food safety and the public health protection.

Later, this β parameter is used to perform quantitation for the 9 volatile FFAs after just a single HS-SPME extraction, using an external solvent calibration curve. The validity of the utilization of an external solvent calibration was tested with aqueous standards of volatile FFAs, getting average recoveries higher than 81.2%. Quantitation by MHS-SPME was free of matrix interferences despite measuring a complex cheese sample. The optimized method was validated, presenting inter-day reproducibility values (as RSD in %) lower than 13%, and limits of detection down to 7 µg kg(-1). The method was also compared with a conventional extraction method such as solid-phase extraction for the studied cheeses elaborated with goat milk, generating comparable results.

24785349,"The mutagen binding ability of the goat probiotics (Lactobacillus reuteri DDL 19, Lactobacillus alimentarius DDL 48, Enterococcus faecium DDE 39, and Bifidobacterium bifidum DDBA) was evaluated. The oral administration of these probiotics reduced fecal mutagens and intestinal cancer markers in goats. Secondly, the effects of probiotics against the mutagenesis induced by sodium azide (SA), and Benzopyrene (B[α]P) by performing the modified Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 was investigated. The capacity to bind benzopyrene and the stability of the bacterial-mutagen complex was analyzed by HPLC. The dismutagenic potential against both mutagens was proportional to probiotic concentration. Results showed that probiotic antimutagenic capacity against SA was ranging from 13 to 78%. The mixture of four goat probiotics (MGP) displayed higher antimutagenic activity against SA than any individual strains at the same cell concentration. This study shows that the highest diminution of mutagenicity in presence of B[α]P (74%) was observed in presence of MGP. The antimutagenic activity of nearly all the individual probiotic and the MGP were in concordance with the B[α]P binding determined by HPLC. According to our results, the B[α]P binding to probiotic was irreversible still after being washed with DMSO solution. The stability of the toxic compounds-bacterial cell binding is a key consideration when probiotic antimutagenic property is evaluated. MGP exhibits the ability to bind and detoxify potent mutagens, and this property can be useful in supplemented foods for goats since it can lead to the removal of potent mutagens and protect and enhance ruminal health and hence food safety of consumers.

23453516,"The effect of goat breed and starter culture on volatile composition and sensory scores in goat milk cheese was studied during 90d of ripening. Milk from 2 goat breeds (Gokceada and Turkish Saanen) and different starter culture systems (no starter, mesophilic and thermophilic starters) were used in the manufacture of goat milk cheeses (called Gokceada goat cheese). Volatile composition was determined by a solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometric method. Sixty compounds including esters (13), carboxylic acids (7), aldehydes (6), ketones (8), alcohols (14), and miscellaneous compounds (12) were identified. Esters, alcohols, and carboxylic acids were the main classes of volatile components in the cheeses. Both qualitatively and quantitatively, the use of different starter cultures and goat breeds significantly influenced the volatile fraction of goat milk cheese. Decanoic, hexanoic, and octanoic (commonly named capric, caproic, and caprylic) acids were indicator compounds to distinguish the goat breeds. Principal component analysis grouped the cheeses based on the use of starter culture and goat breed. Starter-free cheeses were separately located on the plot and age-related changes were present in all samples. Sensory evaluation of 90-d-old cheeses showed that the cheeses from the Gokceada breed received higher odor, flavor, and quality scores than those from the Turkish Saanen breed, and cheeses made using mesophilic starters resulted in the most satisfactory scores for flavor and quality attributes. In conclusion, goat milk cheeses made using milk from Gokceada goats and mesophilic starter culture had the best quality in terms of volatile composition and sensory attributes.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D063427', 'D005524', 'D006041', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Food Quality', 'Food Technology', 'Goats', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Volatiles and sensory evaluation of goat milk cheese Gokceada as affected by goat breeds (Gokceada and Turkish Saanen) and starter culture systems during ripening.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000378', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'metabolism', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23453516,2014
23438683,"The consumer trend for healthier food choices and preferences for low-fat products has increased the interest in low-fat cheese and nutraceutical dairy products. However, consumer preference is still for delicious food. Low- and reduced-fat cheeses are not completely accepted because of their unappealing properties compared with full-fat cheeses. The method reported here provides another option to the conventional cheese-making process to obtain lower fat cheese. Using CO(2) as a supercritical fluid offers an alternative to reduce fat in cheese after ripening, while maintaining the initial characteristics and flavor. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of pressure (10, 20, 30, and 40 × 10(6) Pa) of supercritical CO(2) on the amount of fat extracted, microbial population, polar lipid profile, and microstructure of 2 varieties of goat cheese: Majorero, a protected denomination of origin cheese from Spain, and goat Gouda-type cheese. The amount of fat was reduced 50 to 57% and 48 to 55% for Majorero and goat Gouda-type cheeses, respectively. Higher contents (on a fat basis) of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine were found in Majorero cheese compared with control and goat Gouda-type cheeses. The microbial population was reduced after supercritical fluid extraction in both cheeses, and the lethality was higher as pressure increased in Majorero cheese, most noticeably on lactococcus and lactobacillus bacteria. The Gouda-type cheese did not contain any lactobacilli. Micrographs obtained from confocal laser scanning microscopy showed a more open matrix and whey pockets in the Majorero control cheese. This could explain the ease of extracting fat and reducing the microbial counts in this cheese after treatment with supercritical CO(2). Supercritical fluid extraction with CO(2) has great potential in the dairy industry and in commercial applications. The Majorero cheese obtained after the supercritical fluid extraction treatment was an excellent candidate as a low-fat goat cheese, lower in triglycerides and cholesterol but still with all the health benefits inherent in goat milk.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D058491', 'D002611', 'D025924', 'D063427', 'D005524', 'D006041', 'D008055', 'D011312']","['Animals', 'Bacterial Load', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid', 'Food Quality', 'Food Technology', 'Goats', 'Lipids', 'Pressure']","Effects of supercritical fluid extraction pressure on chemical composition, microbial population, polar lipid profile, and microstructure of goat cheese.","[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23438683,2013

22722200,"In the prehistoric green Sahara of Holocene North Africa-in contrast to the Neolithic of Europe and Eurasia-a reliance on cattle, sheep and goats emerged as a stable and widespread way of life, long before the first evidence for domesticated plants or settled village farming communities. The remarkable rock art found widely across the region depicts cattle herding among early Saharan pastoral groups, and includes rare scenes of milking; however, these images can rarely be reliably dated. Although the faunal evidence provides further confirmation of the importance of cattle and other domesticates, the scarcity of cattle bones makes it impossible to ascertain herd structures via kill-off patterns, thereby precluding interpretations of whether dairying was practiced. Because pottery production begins early in northern Africa the potential exists to investigate diet and subsistence practices using molecular and isotopic analyses of absorbed food residues. This approach has been successful in determining the chronology of dairying beginning in the 'Fertile Crescent' of the Near East and its spread across Europe.

Proteins were extracted from three different cheese samples which were produced from cow, sheep and goat milks. The isolated proteins were cleaved with trypsin and the peptides obtained were sequenced and identified by a HPLC-chip/MS/MS microfluidic system. Two different extraction methods and two various chromatographic sorbents packed in plastic chips were studied. Beta-lactoglobulin and four kinds of casein were found in the cheese samples. The species of kappa-casein were identified unambiguously in all the three cheese samples and, thus, kappa-casein can be used to determine the origin of milk of the cheese.

AFM1 is a potential threat to human health owing to its toxic and carcino- genic effects. This study was aimed to investigate the level of AFM1 in raw and ultra-high-temperature pasteurized (UHT) milk samples. A total of 137 milk specimens (39 from goats, 53 from cows, and 45 from UHT marketmilks) were included to the study, and AFM1 levels were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Aflaprep M immunoaffinity column; R-Biopharm Rhone Ltd., Glasgow) method. AFM1 positivity was detected in 14 (35.8%) goat milk samples, in 46 (86.7%) cow milk samples and 33 (73.3%) UHT milk samples, with the levels ranging from 0.0021 microg/l to 0.8666 microg/I in raw milk, and from 0.001 microg/I to 0.059 microg/I in UHT milk samples.

19323583,"Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are important constituents of dietary fats. While cis-configurated isomers belong to the classic fatty acids of food, trans-fatty acids are suspected to pose a risk to human health. In either case, a thorough assessment of both positional and geometrical isomers of MUFAs is an important task in food and life sciences. For this purpose, a method suitable for routine analysis was developed. After lipid extraction and conversion of fatty acids into corresponding fatty acid methyl esters, cis and trans isomers of MUFAs were separated on silver-ion-impregnated cartridges. Fractions containing either cis- or trans-MUFAs were determined by gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring (GC/EI-MS-SIM) mode using [M-32](+) as quantification ions and [M-74](+) as well as M(+) as qualifier ions. A total of 14 MUFAs were available as reference standards, but a total of 40 MUFAs (22 cis and 18 trans isomers) were identified with high selectivity in samples of cheese, goat fat, human milk, and cod liver oil. The 18:1 and 16:1 isomers contributed most to both the cis- and trans-MUFAs. Application of internal standards allowed for the quantification of MUFAs only in the food samples. The amount of trans-fatty acids was determined to be 0.9- 4.3 g/100 g, with the lowest levels in human milk fat and the highest levels in Roquefort cheese.

19264173,"Determination of the individual fatty acid composition of neutral- and phospholipids as well as the phospholipid content of dairy food and other foodstuffs are important tasks in life sciences. For these purposes, a method was developed for the separation of lipids (standards of triolein and diacylphosphatidylcholines as well as three cheese samples) by solid-phase extraction using a self-packed column filled with partly deactivated silica. Non-halogenated solvents were used for the elution of the lipid classes. Cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) served for the elution of neutral lipids, while polar lipids were eluted with three solvents (ethyl acetate/methanol, methanol, and methanol/water) into one fraction. The separated lipid fractions were transesterified and the individual fatty acids were quantified by using gas chromatography coupled to electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS) in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The recovery rate for standard phosphatidylcholines was approximately 90% and cross-contamination from neutral lipids was negligible. The method was applied to cheese samples. Quantitative amounts of individual fatty acids in the phospholipid fraction were <0.002-0.29% of total lipids from camembert, <0.002-0.12% of total lipids from mozzarella, and <0.002-0.18% of total lipids in a goat cream cheese. Differences in the fatty acid pattern of neutral and polar lipids were detected. The quantity of the fatty acids determined in the phospholipid fraction was divided by the factor 0.7 in order to convert the fatty acid content into the phospholipid content of the cheese samples. This factor is based on the contribution of 16:0 to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The resulting DPPC equivalents (DPPC(eq)) were found to be representative for the average contribution of fatty acids to all classes of phospholipids in dairy products. Using this approach, the phospholipid content of lipids from mozzarella, camembert, and goat cream cheese was 0.60%, 1.42% and 0.79%, respectively.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D002611', 'D004952', 'D005227', 'D008401', 'D010713', 'D010743', 'D012822', 'D052616', 'D014280', 'D014304']","['Cheese', 'Esters', 'Fatty Acids', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Phospholipids', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Triglycerides', 'Triolein']",Quantification of fatty acids as methyl esters and phospholipids in cheese samples after separation of triacylglycerides and phospholipids.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000302', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'isolation & purification', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264173,2009

Solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography techniques have been shown to be useful tools in the quantification of individual free fatty acids in dairy products providing enough sensitivity to detect levels of rancidity in milk. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the short-chain and medium-chain free fatty acid profile in i) raw untreated goat milk; ii) raw goat milk passing through pumps and heating units (plate-and-frame heat exchanger and ohmic heater); and iii) processed goat milk by conventional and ohmic pasteurization to determine the influence of each treatment in the final quality of the milk. Multivariate statistical analysis has shown that the treatments studied were not responsible for the variability found on free fatty acid contents. In particular, it was possible to conclude that ohmic pasteurization at 72 degrees C for 15 s did not promote an extended modification of free fatty acid contents in goat milk when compared with that of conventional pasteurization. Furthermore, principal component analysis showed that the capric acid can be used to discriminate goat's milk with different free fatty acid concentrations.

In addition, the enantiomeric composition of 11 atropisomeric PCB has been determined for the first time in this type of product, using heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatography and 2 enantioselective columns for the unambiguous determination of both enantiomers. Results showed a deviation from the racemic composition for PCB 135, 136, 176, 171, and 183 in the samples analyzed. Whereas PCB 135, 136, and 176 showed an enrichment of the first eluted enantiomer, congeners 171 and 183 showed an enrichment of the first or second eluted enantiomer depending on the dairy product and species. The remaining congeners analyzed (PCB 84, 91, 95, 132, 149, and 174) did not present a clear enrichment of any of the enantiomers.

Mean values for the gross composition in part differed between cheeses. At the end of ripening, cheeses contained 7.98-8.51 log10 cfu/g of non-starter lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus paracasei, Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were dominant in almost all cheeses. As shown by the Principal Component Analysis of RP-FPLC data for the pH 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free amino acids, secondary proteolysis of CC and CV mainly differed from the other two cheeses. A total of 72 volatile components were identified by steam distillation-extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Free fatty acids and esters qualitatively and quantitatively differentiated the profile of CV and CC, respectively. The lowest concentrations of volatile components characterized FC.

17699054,"Soy protein is known to alter intestinal function and structure. We determined in young goats whether a diet partly containing soy protein differently affects intestinal morphology and the jejunal and hepatic proteome as compared with a milk diet. Fourteen male 2-wk-old White German dairy goat kids were fed comparable diets based on whole cow's milk in which 35% of the crude protein was casein (milk protein group; MP) or soy protein supplemented by indispensable AA (SPAA) for 34 d (n = 7/group). Body weight gain and food efficiency were not different. Jejunal and hepatic tissue was collected to determine intestinal morphology by microscopy and protein repertoire by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Jejunal crypt depth was reduced and villus height to crypt depth ratio was higher in SPAA than in milk protein. Out of 131 proteins identified, 32 proteins were found to be differently expressed in both groups. In SPAA, down-regulated jejunal proteins were involved in processes related to cytoskeleton generation, protein, lipid, and energy metabolism. Downregulated hepatic proteins were related to glycolysis and Krebs cycle. Thirteen proteins were upregulated in SPAA. Among these, 2 hepatic proteins were related to carbohydrate breakdown. The other 11 jejunal proteins were involved in cytoskeleton assembly, proteolysis, and carbohydrate breakdown. In addition, glutathione-S-transferase was found to be upregulated in the medial jejunum. In conclusion, a SPAA diet as compared with a milk diet was related to changes in jejunal morphology and jejunal proteins relevant for protein turnover, energy metabolism, and cytoskeleton assembly with no apparent impact on animal BW gain.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000596', 'D000818', 'D000833', 'D001835', 'D002417', 'D003599', 'D004032', 'D015180', 'D004734', 'D006041', 'D007413', 'D007583', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D008855', 'D008892', 'D010449', 'D011506', 'D030262', 'D019032', 'D015430']","['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Animals, Suckling', 'Body Weight', 'Cattle', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Diet', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Goats', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Jejunum', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Milk', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Proteins', 'Soybean Proteins', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Weight Gain']",A milk diet partly containing soy protein does not change growth but regulates jejunal proteins in young goats.,"['Q000097', None, None, None, None, 'Q000648', None, None, None, 'Q000254', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000008', None, None]","['blood', None, None, None, None, 'ultrastructure', None, None, None, 'growth & development', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699054,2007
17517702,"The aim of this study was to establish the transfer of phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene and their major hydroxylated metabolites to milk and to urine after a single oral administration (100 mg per animal of each compound) in 4 lactating goats. Detection and identification of the analytes (native compounds, 1-OH pyrene, 3-OH phenanthrene, 3-OH benzo[a]pyrene) were achieved using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Benzo[a]pyrene, phenanthrene, and pyrene were rapidly detected in the plasma stream, whereas 1-OH pyrene and 3-OH phenanthrene appeared later in plasma. These data suggest that pyrene and phenanthrene are progressively metabolized within the organism. Recovery rates of pyrene and phenanthrene in milk over a 24-h period appeared to be very low (0.014 and 0.006%, respectively), whereas the transfer rates of their corresponding metabolites were significantly higher: 0.44% for 1-OH pyrene and 0.073% for 3-OH phenanthrene. Recovery rates in urine were found to be higher (1 to 10 times) than recovery rates in milk. The 1-OH pyrene was found to be the main metabolite in urine as well as in milk. Thus, as has been established for humans, 1-OH pyrene could be considered as a marker of ruminant exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Because 1-OH pyrene and 3-OH phenanthrene were measured in milk (unlike their corresponding native molecules), metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons should be taken into consideration when evaluating the safety of milk. Benzo[a]pyrene and 3-OH benzo[a]pyrene were (less than 0.005%) transferred to milk and urine in very slight amounts.

Samples from cattle, pigs, goats, deer, horses, chickens, ducks, ostriches, salmon, cod, shrimp, crabs, scallops, bullfrogs and alligators each exhibited unique electrochemical profiles. Species-specific markers exhibited reproducible peak retention times with coefficients of variation less then 6% across different runs, body regions and subjects. The method requires no derivatization or extraction steps and may be applicable to fresh or cooked meats. Incubation of fresh beef, pork or chicken at room temperature for 24h or repeated freezing and thawing changed the intensity but not the pattern of species-specific peaks. In conclusion, this method appears suitable for rapid differentiation of meats from various food animal species and demonstrates the utility of electrochemical detection to supplement existing immunochemical and molecular biological methods.

Three lots of commercial PS cheeses were purchased, and 3 lots of MJ cheeses were manufactured at the University dairy plant. Each lot of the 2 types of cheeses was subdivided into 4 equal portions, and one subsample of each cheese was immediately stored at 4 degrees C as the NFC for 0, 14, and 28 d. The other 3 were immediately frozen (-20 degrees C) for 0, 3, and 6 mo (0MF, 3MF, and 6MF) and subsequently thawed the next day at 4 degrees C. The samples were then stored at 4 degrees C for 0, 14, and 28 d. Organic acids were quantified using an HPLC. The PS had no pyruvic acid, and MJ contained no isotartaric acid; however, several unknown large peaks appeared between propionic and butyric acids. Differences in organic acid contents between PS and MJ cheeses were significant for all acids except citric and lactic acid. Lot effect was significant for most of the known acids, indicating that variations existed in milk composition and manufacturing parameters. Effects of storage treatments (NFC, 0MF, 3MF, and 6MF) were significant for most organic acids, except for orotic and a few unidentified acids. Aging at 4 degrees C for 4 wk had little influence on all organic acids, except butyric acid. Concentrations of butyric, lactic, propionic, tartaric, and uric acids were significantly elevated as the frozen storage period advanced. At the initial stage, there were no differences in pH and acid degree values between NFC and frozen-stored groups of both cheeses. However, acid degree values gradually increased as the refrigerated storage extended up to 4 wk, indicating that lipolysis increased as the refrigeration storage at 4 degrees C advanced.

22833692,"Lead accumulates in bone over many years or decades. Accordingly, the study of lead in bone is important in determining the fate of ingested lead, the potential for remobilization, and for the application of bone lead measurements as a biomarker of lead exposure. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used to measure the spatial distribution of lead in bone on the micrometer scale. In general, LA-ICP-MS studies are somewhat limited by the lack of matrix-matched standards and/or reference materials for calibration and validation purposes. Here we describe the application of pressed pellets prepared from New York State Department of Health candidate Reference Materials for Lead in Bone (levels 1 through 4), to provide a linear calibration for (208)Pb/(43)Ca in the concentration range <1 to 30 μg g(-1). The limit of detection was estimated as 0.2 μg g(-1). The measured lead values for pelletized NIST SRM 1486 Bone Meal and SRM 1400 Bone Ash were in good agreement with certified reference values. Using this approach, we quantitatively measured the spatial distribution of lead in a cross-section of goat metacarpal from a lead-dosed animal. The lead content was spatially variable in the range of 2 to 30 μg g(-1) with a complex distribution. In some sections, lead appeared to be enriched in the center of the bone relative to peripheral areas, indicating preferential accumulation in trabecular (spongy) rather than cortical bone. In addition, there were discrete areas of lead enrichment, or hot spots, of 100 to 200 μm in width.",Journal of analytical atomic spectrometry,[],[],Calibration of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for quantitative measurements of lead in bone.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22833692,2021

LC with UV detection was performed at 25 degrees C on a Hyperclone ODS 5 microm 150 x 4.6 mm column with mobile phase consisting of methanol-ethanol-2-propanol (70 + 15 + 15, v/v/v). Flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Retention time of CoQ10 was 10.9 +/- 0.1 min. The method was sensitive [limit of detection (LOD) = 0.2 mg/kg], reproducible [relative standard deviation (RSD) = 3:0%), and linear up to 25 mg/kg (R > 0.999). LC/MS analysis was performed on a LUNA C18 3 microm, 150 x 4.6 mm column, using mobile phase consisting of ethanol-dioxane-acetic acid (9 + 1 + 0.01, v/v/v), flow rate was 0.6 mL/min, and the retention time of CoQ10 was 4.1 +/- 0.1 min. Identification and quantitation were performed with a Finnigan-LCQ mass detector in positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode. Mass spectra were obtained in selected-ion monitoring mode; molecular mass (M+H)+ m/z 863.4 +/- 1 was used for quantitative determination. MS detection is more sensitive than UV detection (LOD = 0.1 mg/kg), less reproducible (RSD = 4.0%), and linear in selected range.

11589559,"Countries of the Mediterranean area are characterized by production of artisanal cheeses, obtained from goat, sheep, cow and buffalo raw milk. The numbers and species of yeasts in the different cheeses are variable, but some species are more frequently detected than others. Kluyveromyces marxianus, K. lactis with their anamorph, Candida kefir, Debaryomyces hansenii and C. famata, C. colliculosa and C. catenulata are dominant species in several cheeses. However, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is often detected in pasta filata cheeses, such as Water Buffalo Mozzarella (WBM) or Cacio Cavallo Podolico. Recently, a comprehensive study of yeasts isolated from Mozzarella cheese produced in Basilicata (Southern Italy) has been carried out. The study has focused on lactose and/or galactose fermenting species (Kluyveromyces and Saccharomyces) to evaluate their role on the functional and sensory properties of the product. End products in milk were evaluated and the biodiversity in terms of production of sulphur dioxide, higher alcohols, ethyl acetate, and acetaldehyde was studied. In particular, S. cerevisiae strains from Water Buffalo Mozzarella cheese, compared to strains isolated from different habitats, such as wine, exhibited considerable difference in the production of some volatile compounds.

8209226,"We measured the residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the serum of 23 residents of the New Bedford, Massachusetts, area and from two homogenates each of bluefish and lobsters from the same area. We used congener-specific and total Aroclor quantitative approaches, both of which involved gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (electron ionization mode), we confirmed the presence of PCBs in the combined serum samples and in the aliquots of bluefish and lobsters. In measuring the PCB levels in serum, we found good agreement between the two electron capture detector approaches (r > or = 0.97) when the serum of specific congeners was compared to total Aroclor. We used univariate and multivariate quality control approaches to monitor these analyses. Analytical results for bluefish showed a better agreement between the two techniques than did those for lobsters; however, the small number of samples precluded any statistical comparison. We also measured levels of chlorinated pesticides in the serum samples of two groups of New Bedford residents, those with low PCB levels (< 15 ng/ml) and those with high PCB levels (> or = 15 ng/ml). We found that residents with high PCB levels also tended to have higher levels of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di-(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p'-DDE). The higher concentration of all three analytes appears to be influenced by employment in the capacitor industry, by seafood consumption, or both. Using Jaccard measures of similarity and principal component analysis we compared the gas chromatographic patterns of PCBs found in the serum of New Bedford area residents with high serum PCBs with the patterns found in homogenates of lobsters (inclusive of all edible portions except the roe), in homogenates of bluefish fillets taken from local waters, and in serum from goats fed selected technical Aroclors (e.g. Aroclors 1016, 1242, 1254, or 1260). The patterns found in human serum samples were similar to the patterns found in lobster homogenates. Both of these patterns closely resembled patterns found in the serum samples of the goat fed aroclor 1254, as demonstrated by both pattern recognition techniques.

3584974,"During an attempt to isolate shrimp allergens, evidence was obtained that shrimp ribonucleic acid was capable of eliciting a specific IgE response in man and an experimental animal model system. The shrimp ribonucleic acid was extracted from boiled whole shrimp (Peneaus indicus), and was isolated by salt precipitation and sequential chromatography over DEAE-Sephacel and BioGel P-100. The allergenic material was identified as a ribonucleic acid based on the following criteria: a maximal absorption at 258 nm, failure to stain positively with Coomassie Brilliant Blue on slab gel electrophoresis, positive staining with ethidium bromide, co-migration with yeast tRNA on submerged gel electrophoresis in 1.5% Agarose M, and sensitivity to ribonuclease T2 and 0.3 M NaOH. Treatment with protease did not alter its allergenic activity. The RNA was capable of binding allergen-specific IgE in sera from two shrimp-sensitive patients, as demonstrated by microELISA and solid-phase radioimmunoassay (SPRIA) using antigen-coated nitrocellulose filter paper discs and purified 125I-labeled goat anti-human IgE. RNA isolated from shrimp by a conventional tRNA isolation procedure also had the ability to specifically bind IgE in the sera of shrimp-sensitive patients. IgE antibodies to shrimp RNA did not recognize yeast tRNA or salmon testes DNA, and were not detected in sera of other subjects. The shrimp-derived RNA was further able to induce a reaginic response in mice. A combination of in vitro aminoacylation of shrimp tRNA and SPRIA resulted in the identification of the allergenic tRNA as tRNA(Tyr) and tRNA(Arg). Thus, shrimp tRNA is capable of inducing a specific IgE response in man.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","['D000328', 'D000485', 'D000818', 'D003520', 'D033364', 'D005260', 'D005512', 'D006801', 'D007073', 'D008297', 'D051379', 'D008807', 'D010323', 'D012343', 'D051381', 'D012882']","['Adult', 'Allergens', 'Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Decapoda', 'Female', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis', 'RNA, Transfer', 'Rats', 'Skin Tests']",Identification of a shrimp-derived allergen as tRNA.,"[None, 'Q000009', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000209', None, 'Q000276', None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000009', None, None]","[None, 'adverse effects', None, 'pharmacology', 'analysis', None, 'etiology', None, 'immunology', None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'adverse effects', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3584974,1987
4019458,"A sialic acid-binding lectin with high specificity for 9-O-acetyl- and 4-O-acetylsialic acids was purified from the hemolymph of the California coastal crab, Cancer antennarius, by affinity chromatography using bovine submaxillary mucin coupled to agarose. The binding specificity of the crab lectin distinguishes it from other known sialic acid-specific lectins from Limulus polyphemus and Limax flavus which show a broader range of specificity for sialic acids. The purified lectin is homogenous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electropherograms with a subunit molecular weight of about 36 kDa. The specificity of the lectin for O-acetylsialic acids appears to account for the fact that it agglutinates mouse, rat, rabbit, and horse erythrocytes, which contain O-acetylsialic acids on cell surface glycoconjugates, but not human monkey, sheep, goat, and chicken erythrocytes which contain only NeuAc or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc). This conclusion was supported by the potent inhibition of hemagglutination by bovine and equine submaxillary mucins which contain 9(7,8)-O-acetyl- and 4-O-acetylsialic acids, respectively, and also by free 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (9-O-Ac-NeuAc) and 4-O-Ac-NeuAc relative to NeuAc and NeuGc. Further support for the role of O-Ac-sialic acids in hemagglutination of erythrocytes was obtained by enzymatic modification of human erythrocytes. Sialidase-treated erythrocytes were resialylated with purified sialyltransferases and various CMP-sialic acid donor substrates to contain NeuAc or NeuGc or 9-O-Ac-NeuAc in the Sia alpha 2,3Gal or Sia alpha 2,6Gal linkages.

The glycoprotein was purified by ethanol precipitation, phosphocellulose chromatography gel filtration, ethyl:ether and chloroform:methanol extraction. In aqueous phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, the glycoprotein was in an aggregated state with a sedimentation coefficient (S(obs)) to 1.5. Electrophoresis of the glycoprotein on polyacrylamide gels containing phosphate-buffered 0.1% SDS gave a single band, staining with both periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and Coomassie Blue (CB). The apparent m.w., calculated from retardation coefficient, was 25,000. Electrophoresis of the glycoprotein on 1% SDS gels buffered with Tris-acetate (pH 7.4) showed a major band of similar (23,500) apparent m.w. plus four other PAS- and CB-staining bands of lower mobility. With 131I-labeled glycoprotein, recovery of bands from gels, sialic acid analysis, heterophile antigen activity, and re-electrophoresis, it was shown that these additional bands were aggregated forms of a single or closely related glycoprotein species.
