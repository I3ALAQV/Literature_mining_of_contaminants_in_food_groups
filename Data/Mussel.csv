35026485,"Processing stages play critical role in the nutrition and flavor changes of marine products. This study investigated the nutrition and flavor profiles in noble scallop Chlamys nobilis adductor during boiling, rinsing, baking and drying processing stages by high performance liquid chromatography, headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that the overall processing stages favorably preserved the essential amino acids. Drying obviously increased the umami and sweet amino acids contents by 72.08%, 67.77%, respectively (P < 0.05), and promoted the production of flavor nucleotides. In addition, the overall processing stages significantly increased the protein and lipid oxidation degree by (1.49-3.01)-fold and (4.25-5.81)-fold, respectively, compared with raw group (P < 0.05). Moreover, alcohols were the major volatiles in raw group, while the aldehydes, alcohols, and hydrocarbons predominated in rinsing, baking and drying stages.

34455298,"As filter feeders, bivalve mollusks have a high potential risk of contamination by microplastics (MPs), which can be considered a transfer vector for humans through their consumption. Spatial-temporal differences in the MP concentration were evaluated in the cultured oyster Magallana gigas in Todos Santos Bay (TSB) and San Quintin Bay (SQB) during winter and summer (2019). MPs were found in all samples in both seasons, where microfibers were the most abundant particles observed. Only in winter, statistically significant differences were observed in the average concentration of ingested MPs between oysters from TSB and SQB. In each bay, the highest concentrations were observed during winter. Seasonal differences between MP concentrations were only found in TSB. During summer, the content of MPs was compared between the digestive system and the rest of the soft tissue in organisms from each site, and statistically significant differences were not observed, except by one site in SQB. Polymers were identified via μ-FTIR-ATR spectrometry. Polyester, polyacrylonitrile, and rayon were the most common plastics detected. However, due to the low concentration of MPs found in oysters, its consumption does not represent a risk to human health. Moreover, MP concentrations in organisms appear to respond to variables, such as temporality and the water circulation dynamics within the bays.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D000818', 'D061006', 'D004784', 'D006801', 'D008800', 'D000080545', 'D010125', 'D010969', 'D012621', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Bays', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Mexico', 'Microplastics', 'Ostreidae', 'Plastics', 'Seasons', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']","Microplastic concentrations in cultured oysters in two seasons from two bays of Baja California, Mexico.","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34455298,2021

Cadmium and lead concentrations from the extracted whole-body soft tissues were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and bulk δ13C and δ15N isotope ratios and amino-acid-specific δ13C values were analyzed via isotope ratio mass-spectrometry (IRMS). The combined data was subjected to multivariate statistical analysis to assess whether oysters could be linked to their harvest area. Results indicate that discriminant analysis using the δ13C values of five amino acids-serine, glycine, valine, lysine and phenylalanine-could discriminate oysters from two adjacent harvesting in Florida with 90% success rate, using leave-one-out cross validation. The combination of trace elements and isotope ratios could also predict geographic provenance of oysters with a success rate superior to the isolated use of each technique.

A simple and effective clean-up procedure was developed for the simultaneous determination of ten paralytic shellfish toxins (gonyautoxins 1-6, decarbamoylgonyautoxins 2 and 3, and N-sulfocarbamoylgonyautoxins 2 and 3) and tetrodotoxin in the scallop, Mizuhopecten (Patinopecten) yessoensis, and the short-necked clam, Ruditapes philippinarum. To reduce matrix effects, 1% aqueous acetic acid extracts of the bivalves were cleaned up by ion-pair solid-phase extraction using a graphite carbon cartridge with tridecafluoroheptanoic acid as the volatile ion-pair reagent, followed by fourfold dilution. The ten paralytic shellfish toxins and tetrodotoxin were then separated on a hydrophilic interaction chromatography column and quantified by tandem mass spectrometry. The limits of detection and the limits of quantification for the ten PSTs ranged from 0.09 to 13.0 µg saxitoxin equivalents/kg and from 0.26 to 39.4 µg saxitoxin equivalents/kg, respectively. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification for tetrodotoxin ranged from 27.4 to 27.9 µg/kg and from 83.1 to 84.4 µg/kg, respectively. The proposed method yielded minimal matrix effects for the 11 analytes, thus allowing their quantification by simple external calibration.

To clarify the molecular mechanism of Cd accumulation in the viscera of C. gigas, we identified Cd-binding proteins. 5,10,15,20-Tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphinetetrasulfonic acid, disulfuric acid, tetrahydrate, and Cd-binding competition experiments using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography revealed the binding of water-soluble high molecular weight proteins to Cd, including C. gigas protein disulfide isomerase (cgPDI). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses revealed two CGHC motifs in cgPDI. The binding between Cd and rcgPDI was confirmed through a Cd-binding experiment using the TPPS method. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed the binding of two Cd ions to one molecule of rcgPDI. Circular dichroism (CD) spectrum and tryptophan fluorescence analyses demonstrated that the rcgPDI bound to Cd. The binding markedly changed the two-dimensional or three-dimensional structures. The activity of rcgPDI measured by a PDI Activity Assay Kit was more affected by the addition of Cd than by human PDI. Immunological analyses indicated that C. gigas contained cgPDI at a concentration of 1.0 nmol/g (viscera wet weight).

In this study, the accumulation of Mn in male and female gonads during the reproductive cycle of oysters was first examined, and the distributions of Mn in oocytes and sperm cells at different developmental stages were imaged by the nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) at the subcellular level. We found that the distribution and accumulation of Mn during oogenesis were closely associated with the formation and translocation of cortical granules. This is the first time that the enrichment of Mn was directly visualized in cortical granules, which was identified as the major storage site of Mn in oocytes of oysters. Yolk granules were revealed as another storage pool of Mn in oyster oocytes with lower accumulation. In contrast, Mn was mainly distributed in the nucleus of sperm cells with accumulation levels much lower than those in cortical and yolk granules of oocytes. These results demonstrated great differences of the subcellular localization and accumulation capacity of Mn between oocytes and sperm cells in oysters, implying the sex differentiation in susceptibility of reproductive response to Mn stress.

33039366,"Lipophilic shellfish toxins (LSTs) accumulated by shellfish pose a potential threat to consumer health. A mandatory routine monitoring of LSTs has been adopted for seafood products by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in many countries. In this study, two methods developed on liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) under acidic and alkaline chromatographic conditions were assessed for the determination of multiple LSTs. Different strategies including matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD), solid phase extraction (SPE) and sample dilution were applied and evaluated the matrix effects of mussel, scallop, clam, and oyster samples on the signal response of mass spectrometry. Results showed that the alkaline method achieved a lower limit of detection (LOD) and more robust compared to the acidic method. The obvious signal suppression of OA and DTX1 (55%-76%) and signal enhancement of PTX2 (27%-34%) occurred in the crude extracts of shellfish under acidic chromatography. In the alkaline method, no remarkable matrix effects of crude extracts were found except for the scallop matrix on the signal intensity of DTX1, AZA3 and GYM-A (121%-130%). Clean-up methods MSPD, SPE and sample dilution obviously reduced the inhibition of shellfish matrices on the signal response of OA and DTX1, however, which were still subject to signal inhibition under acidic condition.

32977333,"Some harmful algal blooms produce lipophilic marine biotoxins (LMTs) such as okadaic acid (OA; and its analogs dinophysistoxins [DTXs]), yessotoxins (YTXs), pectenotoxins (PTXs), and azaspiracids (AZAs), all of which may accumulate in filter-feeding bivalve mollusks. European health regulations stipulate a limit of 160 μg/kg for OA or DTXs, PTXs, and AZAs and 3.75 mg/kg for YTXs. Argopecten purpuratus is a valuable commercial marine bivalve exploited in Peru. Despite its importance and the periodic reports of the presence of harmful algal blooms in Peruvian coastal waters, information regarding potential contamination of these scallops by LMTs is lacking. We evaluated LMTs in 115 samples of A. purpuratus collected between November 2013 and March 2015 from 18 production areas distributed along the Peruvian coast. The hepatopancreas, which accumulates most of the toxins in the scallop, was analyzed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to quantify OA in its free form, YTX, AZA-1, and PTX-2. Baseline separation was achieved in 19 min. Linearity (R2 > 0.997), precision (coefficient of variation < 15%), and limits of quantification (0.155 to 0.479 ng/mL) were satisfactory. YTX was found in 72 samples, and PTX-2 was found in 17 samples, but concentrations of both biotoxins were below the regulatory limits. Free OA and AZA-1 were not detected in the scallop samples. This atypical profile (i.e., presence of PTX-2 and absence of OA) may be linked to the presence of the dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuminata. The production of YTX could be associated with the phytoplankton Gonyaulax spinifera and Protoceratium reticulatum. This is the first systematic assessment of the four types of LMTs in shellfish from Peruvian coastal waters.

32303806,"The seas worldwide are threatened by a ""new"" source of pollution: millions of tons of all kind of warfare material have been dumped intentionally after World War I and II, in addition to mine barriers, failed detonations as well as shot down military planes and sunken ship wrecks carrying munitions. For example, in the German parts of the North and Baltic Sea approximately 1.6 million metric tons of toxic conventional explosives (TNT and others) and more than 5000 metric tons of chemical weapons are present. Such unexploded ordnance (UXO) constitutes a direct risk of detonation with increased human access (fisheries, water sports, cable constructions, wind farms and pipelines). Moreover, after more than 70 years of resting on the seabed, the metal shells of these munitions items corrode, such that chemicals leak out and distribute in the marine environment. Explosive chemicals such as TNT and its derivatives are known for their toxicity and carcinogenicity. In order not to endanger today's shipping traffic or the installation of pipelines and offshore plants by uncontrolled explosions, controlled blast-in-place (BiP) operations of these dangerous relics is a common practice worldwide. However, blast-in-place methods of in situ munitions disposal often result in incomplete (low-order) detonation, leaving substantial quantities of the explosive material in the environment. In the present free field investigation, we placed mussels (Mytilus spp.) as a biomonitoring system in an area of the Baltic Sea where BiP operations took place and where, by visual inspections by scientific divers, smaller and larger pieces of munitions-related materials were scattered on the seafloor. After recovery, the mussels were transferred to our laboratory and analyzed for TNT and its derivatives via gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Our data unequivocally demonstrate that low-order BiP operations of dumped munitions in the sea lead to multiple increases in the concentration of TNT and its metabolites in the mussels when compared to similar studies at corroding but still encased mines. For this reason, we explicitly criticize BiP operations because of the resulting environmental hazards, which can ultimately even endanger human seafood consumers.",Archives of toxicology,"['D000818', 'D000079687', 'D003257', 'D005107', 'D053834', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D049880', 'D009792', 'D018570', 'D017747', 'D018505', 'D014866', 'D014874', 'D047828', 'D047789']","['Animals', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Explosions', 'Explosive Agents', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Mytilus edulis', 'Oceans and Seas', 'Risk Assessment', 'Seafood', 'Waste Management', 'Waste Products', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'World War I', 'World War II']","""Don't Blast"": blast-in-place (BiP) operations of dumped World War munitions in the oceans significantly increase hazards to the environment and the human seafood consumer.","[None, None, None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000009', None, 'Q000009', 'Q000009', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'adverse effects', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'adverse effects', None, 'adverse effects', 'adverse effects', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303806,2021

31769916,"A 15-kDa lectin, termed SeviL, was isolated from Mytilisepta virgata (purplish bifurcate mussel). SeviL forms a noncovalent dimer that binds strongly to ganglio-series GM1b oligosaccharide (Neu5Acɑ2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4Glc) and its precursor, asialo-GM1 (Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4Glc). SeviL also interacts weakly with the glycan moiety of SSEA-4 hexaose (Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc). A partial protein sequence of the lectin was determined by mass spectrometry, and the complete sequence was identified from transcriptomic analysis. SeviL, consisting of 129 amino acids, was classified as an R(icin B)-type lectin, based on the presence of the QxW motif characteristic of this fold. SeviL mRNA is highly expressed in gills and, in particular, mantle rim tissues. Orthologue sequences were identified in other species of the family Mytilidae, including Mytilus galloprovincialis, from which lectin MytiLec-1 was isolated and characterized in our previous studies. Thus, mytilid species contain lectins belonging to at least two distinct families (R-type lectins and mytilectins) that have a common β-trefoil fold structure but differing glycan-binding specificities. SeviL displayed notable cytotoxic (apoptotic) effects against various cultured cell lines (human breast, ovarian, and colonic cancer; dog kidney) that possess asialo-GM1 oligosaccharide at the cell surface. This cytotoxic effect was inhibited by the presence of anti-asialo-GM1 oligosaccharide antibodies. With HeLa ovarian cancer cells, SeviL showed dose- and time-dependent activation of kinase MKK3/6, p38 MAPK, and caspase-3/9.

The results indicated that the SGPI-EGCG conjugate contained more β-sheet but less α-helix than SGPIs, leading to the changes of the secondary and tertiary conformation stability after conjugation. The radical scavenging and oxygen radical absorbance capacity of SGPIs were significantly increased by 4.9 times and 7.4 times, respectively, after the EGCG-grafting reaction. Compared with that stabilized by SGPIs, tuna oil emulsions emulsified by the SGPI-EGCG conjugate exhibited a smaller particle size and better storage stability. Furthermore, the SGPI-EGCG conjugate inhibited lipid and fatty acid oxidation during storage more significantly in tuna oil emulsions than SGPIs due to its higher interfacial accumulation and antioxidant activities. These results suggested that the SGPI-EGCG conjugate could be utilized as an efficient surface-active antioxidant and emulsifier for the encapsulation and protection of unsaturated lipids.",Food & function,"['D000818', 'D000975', 'D001704', 'D002392', 'D002942', 'D045703', 'D004655', 'D005227', 'D005395', 'D029941', 'D005609', 'D006066', 'D050356', 'D010084', 'D049897', 'D013056', 'D017550', 'D014413']","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Biopolymers', 'Catechin', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Emulsifying Agents', 'Emulsions', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fish Oils', 'Fish Proteins', 'Free Radicals', 'Gonads', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Pectinidae', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Tuna']",Fabrication of surface-active antioxidant biopolymers by using a grafted scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) gonad protein isolate-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) conjugate: improving the stability of tuna oil-loaded emulsions.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576869,2020
31450478,"One of the major challenges currently faced is to develop systematic ways of addressing chemical mixtures in environmental assessment. With this purpose, a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the detection and quantification of a mixture of relevant contaminants in molluscs has been developed. The method is based on QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) and Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). It includes a mixture of 23 compounds formed by pesticides, endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals (metolachlor, simazine, desethylatrazine, atrazine, thiabendazole, diazinon, malathion, bentazone, MCPA, propanil, acetamiprid, imidacloprid, caffeine, bisphenol A, triclosan, triclocarban, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, 1H-benzotriazole, sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine and carbamazepine). The method was developed and validated in 4 different types of shellfish of high commercial interest such as mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), oyster (Crassostrea gigas), cockle (Cerastoderma edule) and razor shell (Solen marginatus). The mean percentage of recoveries obtained for all the compounds in each mollusc type (intra-specie) ranged from 96% to 107% showing the good performance of the method developed. The relative standard deviation was under 10% for the intra-day and 17% inter-day analyses. Method detection limits and method quantification limits were below 10 ng/g dry weight for all the species and compounds targeted. Finally, the method was applied to aquaculture samples, oysters and cockles, from Ebro Delta (Spain), after some episodes of mortality occurred in 2017. A high level of bisphenol A was detected in C. edule which may explain the mortality suffered by this organism.

However, there is limited information on the potential effects of this pesticide on commercially important shellfish, such as oysters. We investigated the impacts of IMI and Spectrum 200SC (IMI formulation) on the activity of the enzymes Glutathione-S-transferase (GST), Catalase (CAT) and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in different oyster tissues including the gill, adductor muscle and digestive gland. We also investigated the condition index and fatty acid composition of the flesh of oysters after 2 weeks exposure. The concentrations of IMI in the different tissues was assessed using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) after QuEChERS extraction. Higher concentrations of IMI residues were detected in the adductor muscle of the oysters, followed by the gills and with the lowest amounts recovered from the digestive gland across all the concentrations tested. IMI and Spectrum 200SC significantly affected the gill AChE activity at 2 mg/L, but digestive gland CAT, and gill and digestive gland GST were impacted at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.01 and 0.05 mg/L). In the whole oyster, 2 weeks exposure to IMI (≥0.01 mg/L) resulted in a proportional increase in saturated fatty acids (SFA), altered the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to SFA ratio and altered the omega 3 fatty acids (n-3) to omega 6 fatty acids (n-6) ratio, but there were no effects on the condition index of the oyster. Although the oysters responded differently to the formulated product, there was no consistent difference in the sublethal effects of analytical IMI and Spectrum 200SC.

30997934,"Protein isolates were recovered from scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) gonads to develop a novel functional matrix by investigating their physiochemical and functional properties. Scallop gonad protein isolates (SGPIs) were prepared from degreased scallop gonads (DSGs) by an alkali extraction and isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) process. The protein compositions of the SGPIs were mainly vitellogenin and beta-actin with molecular weights of 266 and 42 kDa, respectively, as determined using Nano-liquid chromatography-mass/mass (Nano-LC-MS/MS). After the ISP process, the protein solubility of the SGPIs was significantly improved, and the surface hydrophobicity of SGPIs intensely increased by 1.1-fold, which were attributed to the exposure of aromatic residues such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. However, the content of total/reactive sulfhydryl in SGPIs was decreased compared with that of DSGs. Meanwhile, the ISP process caused partial protein unfolding, as indicated by circular dichroism analysis, which exhibited a remarkable rise in the β-sheet content with a parallel decline in the α-helix and random coil contents (P < 0.05). SGPIs exhibited a better oil absorption capacity and foaming property than both DSGs and soybean protein isolates (SPIs). Moreover, the emulsifying capacity of SGPIs was greatly enhanced by the ISP process, which was superior to the effect of commercial SPIs and was ascribed to its favorable solubility as well as surface characteristics. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: During the processing of scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) adductors, scallop gonad, a high-protein part, is usually discarded as processing by-products despite its edibility. In recent years, scallop gonads are regarded as good sources to develop protein matrices due to their high protein content and numerous nutrients. In this study, scallop gonad protein isolates (SGPIs) were isolated by isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) process. The preferable solubility, foaming property coupled with high emulsifying property of SGPIs indicated that the SGPIs could be potentially utilized as a good protein emulsifier and additives in production of kamaboko gels, hamburger patties, sausages, and pet foods.",Journal of food science,"['D000818', 'D002853', 'D045703', 'D004655', 'D005503', 'D005524', 'D005782', 'D006066', 'D006801', 'D049897', 'D011506', 'D017747', 'D012995', 'D053719']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Emulsifying Agents', 'Emulsions', 'Food Additives', 'Food Technology', 'Gels', 'Gonads', 'Humans', 'Pectinidae', 'Proteins', 'Seafood', 'Solubility', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Physiochemical Properties and Functional Characteristics of Protein Isolates from the Scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) Gonad.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30997934,2019

30659485,"The attractive qualities of plastics lead us, around the world, to an enormous need for plastic goods, which results in their unsustainable overconsumption. Bio-based products are the core concept of circular economy, yet this sector suffers from the high cost of their production. In practice, biopolymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA), are still limitedly used, due to their expensiveness and not outstanding technological properties. A circular and sustainable solution would be to use waste from the food industry as filler that contributes to reduce the cost of PLA-based materials, thereby encouraging their widespread use. At the same time, this would be a circular approach to wisely upgrade food waste and prevent pollution. Ceramic food waste powder fillers from egg shells and from mussel shells were compounded with PLA at 180 °C to obtain composites, which contain an unprecedented high amount of filler, equal to 140 over 100 parts of PLA. We analyzed volatile organic compounds emitted from PLA and, for the very first time, from its composites via headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). The molecular fingerprint of the volatiles comprises only three aldehydes, a ketone, and two lactides. Volatiles typical of fossil plastics, that are causative factors of hormone disruption or reproductive dysfunction, are effectively missing.

This work describes an update and validation of a method of selective hydride generation (HG) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for high-throughput screening of iAs content in seafood samples after microwave-assisted extraction with diluted nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. High concentration of HCl (8 M) for HG along with hydrogen peroxide in samples of a same concentration as used for extraction leads to a selective conversion of iAs to volatile arsine that is released and transported to the detector. A minor contribution from methylarsonate (≈20% to iAs) was found, while HG from dimethylarsinate, trimethylarsine oxide is substantially suppressed (less than 1% to iAs). Methodology was applied to Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) TORT-3, DORM-3, DORM-4, DOLT-4, DOLT-5, PRON-1, SQID-1 and ERM-CE278k, in some of them iAs has been determined for the first time, and to various seaweed samples from a local store.

We present a modified setup of the human simulator of the gut microbial ecosystem (SHIME), with four sequential gastrointestinal reactors (oral, stomach, small intestine, and colon), including the salivary and colonic microbiomes. Naturally arsenic-containing rice, mussels, and nori seaweed were digested in the presence of microorganisms and in vitro oral bioaccessibility, bioavailability, and metabolism of arsenic species were evaluated following analysis by using HPLC/mass spectrometry. When food matrices were digested with salivary bacteria, the soluble arsenic in the gastric digestion stage increased for mussel and nori samples, but no coincidence impact was found in the small intestinal and colonic digestion stages. However, the simulated small intestinal absorption of arsenic was increased in all food matrices (1.2-2.7 fold higher) following digestion with salivary microorganisms. No significant transformation of the arsenic species occurred except for the arsenosugars present in mussels and nori. In those samples, conversions between the oxo arsenosugars were observed in the small intestinal digestion stage whereupon the thioxo analogs became major metabolites.

In The Netherlands it was therefore decided to monitor TTX in shellfish harvested from Dutch production areas. All shellfish production areas were monitored in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In total 1063 samples were investigated, and the highest concentrations were observed in 2016, i.e., 253 µg TTX/kg in oysters and 101 µg TTX/kg in mussels. No TTX analogues, with the exception of 4-epi-TTX in one single sample, were found and contaminated samples also showed positive results in the neuro-2a bioassay. The occurrence of TTX seems to be consistent over the last three years with the highest concentrations observed annually in late June. The causative organism and the reasons why specific Dutch production areas are affected while others are not, are still unclear. Initially in The Netherlands an action limit of 20 µg TTX/kg was used to ensure the safety of consumers (2016), but recently The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established an acute reference dose, and based on a high portion size of consuming 400 g mussels, this dose was translated into a safe concentration of 44 µg TTX per kg for shellfish.

To achieve the optimum balance of dietary carbohydrates and proteins and explore the mechanisms behind the phenomenon, we formulated five isoenergetic and isolipidic diets (C30P40, C35P35, C40P30, C45P25, and C50P20) with different levels of carbohydrates (C) and proteins (P). There were five experimental groups (C30P40, C35P35, C40P30, C45P25, and C50P20) and two control groups (CG1 and CG2). CG1 was fed with mixed powders of yeast and Chlorella sp., and CG2 was cultured in natural sea. After 60-day feeding, the highest rates of survival and absolute growth appeared in C45P25. C45P25 exhibited significantly higher activities of amylase, protease, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and phenoloxidase and significantly lower malondialdehyde content than C30P40, C35P35, C40P30, C50P20, and CG1. No significant differences were observed between C45P25 and CG2. Furthermore, the total antioxidant capacity of the pearl oysters in C45P25 was significantly higher than that in C30P40, C35P35, C40P30, and C50P20. On the basis of these results, the optimal balance of proteins and carbohydrates for pearl oysters was the C45P25 diet. Metabolomics-based profiling of the pearl oysters fed with high-carbohydrate/low-protein diet (C45P25) and low-carbohydrate/high-protein diet (C30P40) revealed 80 significantly different metabolites (VIP > 1 and P < 0.05). Furthermore, integrated key metabolic pathway analysis showed that C45P25 regulated starch and sucrose metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism to meet the energy demand and increase the glucogenic amino acid, thereby promoting protein synthesis and reducing fatty acid β-oxidation in comparison with C30P40.

29521567,"The principal aim of this study was to monitor the occurrence of some metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fish and mussels from the Gulf of Naples. A comparison with previous researches of the same area was carried out, and the intakes of these compounds through the diet and their effect on the tolerable intake values (when available) were assessed. Cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) were detected by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy (Cd, Cr, and Pb); arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg) were detected by applying the hydride method. PAHs were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. Widespread contamination was found. Among the metals, Hg showed the highest maximum levels of 284.94 ng/g wet weight (ww) in fish and 480.00 ng/g ww in mussels. Chrysene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, anthracene, and benzo[k]fluoranthene were the most common PAHs in fish, whereas benzo[a]anthracene, pyrene, phenanthrene, acenaphthylene, and acenaphthene were the most frequently occurring compounds in mussels. The concentrations of As, Cr, Hg, Pb, and PAHs in fish were found to decrease over a period of 30 years, whereas the Cd levels remained constant. The Hg, Pb, and PAH levels in mussels increased over the period 2010 to 2016. Finally, the average consumption of mussels led to the highest effect on the Tolerable Daily Intake of Hg, which was exceeded by 19%.","Journal of environmental science and health.

29476233,"Single laboratory validation of a method for arsenic speciation analysis in seafood and seaweed is presented. The method is based on stepwise extraction of water-soluble and non-polar arsenic with hot water and a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol, respectively. While the water-soluble arsenicals were speciated by anion and cation exchange liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS), the non-polar arsenicals were collectively determined by ICP-MS after digestion in acid. The performance characteristics and broad application of the method were evaluated by analyzing eight commercial samples (cod, haddock, mackerel, crab, shrimp, geoduck clam, oyster, and kombu) and four reference materials (fish protein (DORM-4), lobster hepatopancreas (TORT-3), mussel tissue (SRM 2976), and hijiki seaweed (CRM 7405-a)) representing finfish, crustaceans, molluscs, and seaweed. Matrices spiked at three levels in duplicates were also analyzed. The stepwise extraction provided 76-106% extraction of the total arsenic from the test materials. The method demonstrated satisfactory repeatability for analysis of replicate extracts prepared over several days. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by analyzing reference materials certified for both total arsenic and a few arsenicals; the experimental results were 90-105% of the certified values. Comparison between the total water-soluble arsenic and the sum of the concentrations of the chromatographed species gave 80-92% mass balance. While spike recoveries of most arsenicals were in the acceptance range set by CODEX, a few species spiked into cod, haddock, and shrimp were poorly recovered due to transformation to other forms. After thorough investigations, strategies were devised to improve the recoveries of these species by averting their transformations.

However, the conventional analysis of seafood deterioration using chromatography instruments and bacterial colony counting depends on time-consuming and food-destructive treatments. In this study, we demonstrate a non-destructive and rapid food freshness monitoring system by a triangular study of sensory evaluation, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), and a bioelectronic nose. The sensory evaluation indicated that the acceptability and flavor deteriorated gradually during post-harvest storage (4 °C) for 6 days. The GC-MS analysis recognized the reduction of freshness by detecting a generation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) from the headspace of oyster in a refrigerator (4 °C) at 4 days post-harvest. However, the bioelectronic nose incorporating human olfactory receptor peptides with the carbon nanotube field-effect transistor sensed trimethylamine (TMA) from the oyster at 2 days post-harvest with suggesting early recognition of oysters' quality and freshness deterioration.

29256161,"A polyclonal antibody specific to an egg protein of Suminoe oyster Crassostrea ariakensis was previously developed in our laboratory to assess the reproductive life cycle of the oyster. The present study was undertaken to investigate vitellin of C. ariakensis (CAVt). Vitellin is an essential component of egg proteins in marine invertebrates as it provides energy and nutrients to the embryo and larvae. CAVt was purified from eggs of the oyster using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by affinity chromatography with Concanavalin A-agarose. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and sodium dodecyl sulfate PAGE showed that CAVt is a high molecular weight [532 kiloDaltons (kDa)] protein, with multiple subunits. Similar to other vitellin proteins, it is a phospholipoglycoprotein composed of phospholipids (12.06%), carbohydrates (mannose, 10.08% or glucose, 9.84%), and alkali-labile phosphates (4.16%). Affinity chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent aasay (ELISA) and western blot analysis revealed that CAVt is only present in the ovary, and two subunits of CAVt (72 and 35 kDa) are believed to be incorporated from the hemolymph into the oocyte. The antibody specific to CAVt (anti-CAVt), raised in rabbit, strongly cross reacted with the egg proteins of oyster species and scallops, suggesting that the antigenic epitopes are highly conserved among species.

Small numbers of reddish-orange shell Yesso scallops, Patinopecten yessoensis, were found in cultured populations compared to the brown majority. In this study, a genome-wide association study was conducted to understand the genetic basis of shell color. Sixty-six 2b-RAD libraries with equal numbers of reddish-orange and brown shell individuals were constructed and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 322,332,684 high-quality reads were obtained, and the average sequencing depth was 18.4×. One genomic region on chromosome 11 that included 239 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was identified as significantly associated with shell color. After verification by high-resolution melting in another population, two SNPs were selected as specific loci for reddish-orange shell color. These two SNPs could be used to improve the selective breeding progress of true-breeding strains with complete reddish-orange scallops. In addition, within the significantly associated genomic region, candidate genes were identified using marker sequences to search the draft genome of Yesso scallop. Three genes (LDLR, FRIS, and FRIY) with known functions in carotenoid metabolism were identified. Further study using high-performance liquid chromatography proved that the relative level of carotenoids in the reddish-orange shells was 40 times higher than that in the brown shells.

The method consists of a single-step dispersive extraction in 1% acetic acid, followed by a carbon SPE cleanup step before dilution and instrumental analysis.

The method can also be run as the acquisition of TTX together with paralytic shellfish toxins. Results demonstrated acceptable method performance characteristics for specificity, linearity, recovery, ruggedness, repeatability, matrix variability, and within-laboratory reproducibility for the analysis of TTX. The LOD and LOQ were fit-for-purpose in comparison to the current action limit for TTX enforced in The Netherlands.

27591651,"The analytical procedures for reference measurements of the total Hg and methyl mercury (MeHg) mass fractions at various concentration levels in marine biota samples, candidates for certified reference materials (oyster and clam Gafrarium tumidum), were evaluated. Two modes of application of isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method (ID ICP-MS), namely direct isotope dilution and species-specific isotope dilution analysis with the use of two different quantification mass spectrometry techniques were compared. The entire ID ICP-MS measurement procedure was described by mathematical modelling and the combined uncertainty of measurement results was estimated. All factors influencing the final results as well as isotopic equilibrium were systematically investigated. This included the procedural blank, the moisture content in the biota samples and all factors affecting the blend ratio measurements (instrumental background, spectral interferences, dead time and mass discrimination effects as well as the repeatability of measured isotopic ratios). Modelling of the entire measurement procedures and the use of appropriate certified reference materials enable to assure the traceability of obtained values to the International System of Units (SI): the mole or the kilogram. The total mass fraction of mercury in oyster and clam biota samples, after correction for moisture contents, was found to be: 21.1 (1.1) 10(-9) kg kg(-1) (U =5.1% relative, k=2) and 390.0 (9.4) 10(-9) kg kg(-1) (U=2.4% relative, k=2), respectively. For the determination of mercury being present as methyl mercury, the non-chromatographic separation on anion-exchange resin AG1-X8 of the blended samples was applied. The content of MeHg (as Hg) in oyster sample was found: 4.81 (24) 10(-9)kgkg(-1) (U=5.0%, k=2) and 4.84 (21) 10(-9)kgkg(-1) (U=4.3%, k=2) with the use of quadrupole (ICP QMS) or sector field (ICP SFMS) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers, respectively. In the case of clam sample, the concentration of MeHg (as Hg) was found to be: 61.0 (2.3) 10(-)(9)kgkg(-1) (U=3.8%, k=2) and 61.3 (2.2) 10(-)(9)kgkg(-1) (U=3.6%, k=2), respectively.

27491971,"In this study, we conducted a 14-month investigation in Daya Bay, southern China to understand the effects of oyster farming on phytoplankton community and biomass by using size-fractionated phytopigments. Results proved the filtering effects of oysters on phytoplankton biomass. During the oyster culture period, the average concentration of total chlorophyll a (sum of size-fractionated Chl a) within the farming area was approximately 60% lower than that at the reference site. Phytoplankton depletion in the aquaculture zone mainly occurred in micro-sized fractions (>20 μm) of Chl a, fucoxanthin, and peridinin. The influence of oyster filtration on nano-sized (2.7-20 μm) pigments seemed less than that on micro-sized ones. The depletion of peridinin and 19'-hex-fucoxanthin in aquaculture zone was higher than those of the other pigments, which indicated that flagellated cells might be selectively filtered by oysters and could be more easily influenced by oyster aquaculture. The pico-sized Chl a (<2.7 μm) comprised 24% of total Chl a on the average in the aquaculture zone during the cultural period compared to 6% in the reference site. Picoeukaryote abundance, which was determined via flow cytometry, was significantly higher in the aquaculture zone than in the non-aquaculture areas. The abundance of picoeukaryote is significantly and positively correlated with the concentrations of pico-sized prasinoxanthin, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin, indicating that picoeukaryote is dominated by those in prasinophyte. The results suggest that oyster aquaculture might stimulate the growth of prasinophyte, although the seasonal variations are mainly controlled by the water temperature in the study area. This research highlights the successful use of size-fractionated phytopigments to estimate size-specific phytoplankton biomass and community, which can be applied as a routine method to monitor the environmental effect and food resources of bivalve aquaculture.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D000818', 'D017756', 'D061006', 'D018533', 'D002681', 'D002734', 'D000460', 'D002851', 'D017753', 'D004784', 'D010125', 'D010839', 'D012621', 'D013696']","['Animals', 'Aquaculture', 'Bays', 'Biomass', 'China', 'Chlorophyll', 'Chlorophyta', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ecosystem', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Ostreidae', 'Phytoplankton', 'Seasons', 'Temperature']","Size-dependent depletion and community disturbance of phytoplankton under intensive oyster mariculture based on HPLC pigment analysis in Daya Bay, South China Sea.","[None, None, 'Q000382', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000254', None, None, None, None, 'Q000254', None, None]","[None, None, 'microbiology', None, None, 'analysis', 'growth & development', None, None, None, None, 'growth & development', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491971,2017

27367728,"Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) traditionally have been analyzed by liquid chromatography with either pre- or post-column derivatization and always with a silica-based stationary phase. This technique resulted in different methods that need more than one run to analyze the toxins. Furthermore, tetrodotoxin (TTX) was recently found in bivalves of northward locations in Europe due to climate change, so it is important to analyze it along with PST because their signs of toxicity are similar in the bioassay. The methods described here detail a new approach to eliminate different runs, by using a new porous graphitic carbon stationary phase. Firstly we describe the separation of 13 PST that belong to different groups, taking into account the side-chains of substituents, in one single run of less than 30 min with good reproducibility. The method was assayed in four shellfish matrices: mussel (Mytillus galloprovincialis), clam (Pecten maximus), scallop (Ruditapes decussatus) and oyster (Ostrea edulis). The results for all of the parameters studied are provided, and the detection limits for the majority of toxins were improved with regard to previous liquid chromatography methods: the lowest values were those for decarbamoyl-gonyautoxin 2 (dcGTX2) and gonyautoxin 2 (GTX2) in mussel (0.0001 mg saxitoxin (STX)·diHCl kg(-1) for each toxin), decarbamoyl-saxitoxin (dcSTX) in clam (0.0003 mg STX·diHCl kg(-1)), N-sulfocarbamoyl-gonyautoxins 2 and 3 (C1 and C2) in scallop (0.0001 mg STX·diHCl kg(-1) for each toxin) and dcSTX (0.0003 mg STX·diHCl kg(-1) ) in oyster; gonyautoxin 2 (GTX2) showed the highest limit of detection in oyster (0.0366 mg STX·diHCl kg(-1)).

27156753,"For the rapid simultaneous determination of monosodium glutamate (MSG), benzoic acid (BA), and sorbic acid (SA) in canned food and other processed food samples, we developed a method that combines in-capillary derivatization with separation by capillary electrophoresis. This method employs the rapid derivatization of MSG with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) in the presence of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) and enables the detection of the resulting OPA-MSG derivative and of non-derivatized BA and SA at 230nm. The composition of the background electrolyte and the parameters of derivatization and separation are as follows: 25mM borax containing 5mM OPA and 6mM 3-MPA, separation voltage 25mV, injection at 30mbar for 20s, and column temperature 25°C. Because of the high reaction rate and suitably adapted effective electrophoretic mobilities, band broadening due to the derivatization reaction at the start of the separation process is kept to a minimum. The optimized method is validated with respect to LOD, LOQ, linearity, recovery, and precision. This method can be applied to real samples such as soy, fish, oyster and sweet and sour chili sauces after application of appropriate clean-up steps. Mechanisms of zone broadening and zone focusing are discussed showing the validity of the employed theoretical approach regarding the dependence of the peak shape for OPA-MSG on the concentration of MSG in the sample.

Important parameters of the SPE procedure were optimized, including the amount of basic alumina and the type and volume of the washing and elution solvents.

26958981,"In recent years, our group and several others have been describing the presence of new, not previously reported, toxins of high toxicity in vectors that may reach the human food chain. These include tetrodotoxin in gastropods in the South of Europe, ciguatoxin in fish in the South of Spain, palytoxin in mussels in the Mediterranean Sea, pinnatoxin all over Europe, and okadaic acid in the south of the U.S. There seem to be new marine toxins appearing in areas that are heavy producers of seafood, and this is a cause of concern as most of these new toxins are not included in current legislation and monitoring programs. Along with the new toxins, new chemical analogues are being reported. The same phenomenom is being recorded in freshwater toxins, such as the wide appearance of cylindrospermopsin and the large worldwide increase of microcystin. The problem that this phenomenon, which may be linked to climate warming, poses for toxicologists is very important not only because there is a lack of chronic studies and an incomplete comprehension of the mechanism driving the production of these toxins but also because the lack of a legal framework for them allows many of these toxins to reach the market. In some cases, it is very difficult to control these toxins because there are not enough standards available, they are not always certified, and there is an insufficient understanding of the toxic equivalency factors of the different analogues in each group. All of these factors have been revealed and grouped through the massive increase in the use of LC-MS as a monitoring tool, legally demanded, creating more toxicological problems.

The concentration of each measured element was considered for this evaluation, using maximum residue level (MRL) in foods established by the Brazilian (ANVISA), American (USFDA) and European Communities (EC) legislations. Values for estimated daily ingestion (EDI) were determined for metals intake through mussel and scallop consumption. These estimates were compared with the reference value of (PTDI) proposed by World Health Organization (WHO).

These toxins can be monitored by a variety of techniques, including mouse bioassay, receptor binding assay, and liquid chromatography with either mass spectrometric or pre- or post-column fluorescence detection. The post-column oxidation liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection method, used routinely in our laboratory, has been shown to be a reliable method for monitoring paralytic shellfish toxins in mussel, scallop, oyster and clam species. However, due to its high sensitivity to naturally fluorescent matrix interferences, when working with unconventional matrices, there may be problems in identifying toxins because of naturally fluorescent interferences that co-elute with the toxin peaks. This can lead to erroneous identification. In this study, in order to overcome this challenge in echinoderm and gastropod matrices, we optimized the conversion of Gonyautoxins 1 and 4 to Neosaxitoxin with 2-mercaptoethanol.

The analysis step performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was fully optimized to improve the sensitivity of the separation and detection steps. The extraction of solid samples was accomplished using focused ultrasonic solid-liquid extraction (FUSLE), which required a low amount of sample (0.5 g), solvent (7 mL acetonitrile/H2O, 95:5 v/v) and short extraction time (30 s). In the optimisation of the clean-up step, mixed mode solid-phase extraction (SPE) using a strong cation exchanger rendered clean extracts and the best results in terms of extraction efficiency and matrix effect. The same SPE mode was also used for the extraction and pre-concentration of TCAs from environmental water matrices. The methods afforded satisfactory apparent recovery values (86-122%) and repeatability (RSD < 5%), regardless of the matrix. Finally, the developed methods were applied to the analysis of real samples from the Biscay Coast, where TCAs were detected in both water and biota samples up to 25.9 ng/L and 1.8 ng/g, respectively.

26615827,"The neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) is naturally present in some microalgal species in the marine environment. The accumulation of BMAA has widely been observed in filter-feeding bivalves that are known to consume primary producers constituting the base of complex aquatic food webs. This study was performed to assess the occurrence of BMAA and isomers in mollusks collected from nine representative shellfish production areas located on the three French coasts (Channel, Atlantic and Mediterranean sites). The use of a highly selective and sensitive HILIC-MS/MS method, with D5DAB as internal standard, revealed the systematic detection of BMAA and DAB, in concentrations ranging from 0.20 to 6.7 μg g(-1) dry weight of digestive gland tissues of mollusks. While we detected BMAA in four strains of diatoms in a previous study, here BMAA was only detected in one diatom species previously not investigated out of the 23 microalgal species examined (belonging to seven classes). The concentrations of BMAA and DAB in mussels and oysters were similar at different sampling locations and despite the high diversity of phytoplankton populations that mollusks feed on at these locations. Only small variations of BMAA and DAB levels were observed and these were not correlated to any of the phytoplankton species reported. Therefore, extensive research should be performed on both origin and metabolism of BMAA in shellfish. The levels observed in this study are similar to those found in other studies in France or elsewhere. A previous study had related such levels to a cluster of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in the South of France; hence the widespread occurrence of BMAA in shellfish from all coasts in France found in this study suggests the need for further epidemiological and toxicological studies to establish the levels that are relevant for a link between the consumption of BMAA-containing foodstuffs and neurodegenerative diseases.

Results showed the presence of a wide variety of molecules involved in host-microbe interactions, including putative adhesion molecules (e.g. c-type lectins) confirming that transcripts previously identified in epithelial cells are translated into proteins secreted in mucus.

Hence, it is desirable to develop easy, sensitive and fast analytical screening methods for the determination of AgNPs in complex biological matrices. This study describes such a method using solid sampling high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). A recently reported novel evaluation strategy uses the atomization delay of the respective GFAAS signal as significant indicator for AgNPs and thereby allows discrimination of AgNPs from ionic silver (Ag(+)) in the samples without elaborate sample pre-treatment. This approach was further developed and applied to a variety of biological samples. Its suitability was approved by investigation of eight different food samples (parsley, apple, pepper, cheese, onion, pasta, maize meal and wheat flour) spiked with ionic silver or AgNPs. Furthermore, the migration of AgNPs from silver-impregnated polypropylene food storage boxes to fresh pepper was observed and a mussel sample obtained from a laboratory exposure study with silver was investigated. The differences in the atomization delays (Δt(ad)) between silver ions and 20-nm AgNPs vary in a range from -2.01 ± 1.38 s for maize meal to +2.06 ± 1.08 s for mussel tissue. However, the differences were significant in all investigated matrices and so indicative of the presence/absence of AgNPs. Moreover, investigation of model matrices (cellulose, gelatine and water) gives the first indication of matrix-dependent trends.

26411449,"A novel treatment mix was designed for the simultaneous immobilization of As, Cu, and Pb in contaminated soils using natural (waste oyster shells (WOS)) and industrial (coal mine drainage sludge (CMDS)) waste materials. The treatments were conducted using the standard U.S. sieve size no. 20 (0.85 mm) calcined oyster shells (COS) and CMDS materials with a curing time of 1 and 28 days. The As immobilization treatments were evaluated using the 1-N HCl extraction fluid, whereas the Pb and Cu immobilization treatments were evaluated using the 0.1-N HCl extraction fluid based on the Korean leaching standards. The treatment results showed that the immobilization of As, Cu, and Pb was best achieved using a combination mix of 10 wt% COS and 10 wt% CMDS. This treatment mix was highly effective leading to superior leachability reductions for all three target contaminants (>93 % for As and >99 % for Cu and Pb) for a curing period of 28 days. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) results showed that As was present in the form of As(V) in the control sample and that no changes in As speciation were observed following the COS-CMDS treatments. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) sample treated with 10 wt% COS and 10 wt% CMDS indicated that As immobilization may be associated with the formation of Ca-As and Fe-As precipitates while Pb and Cu immobilization was most probably linked to calcium silicate hydrates (CSHs) and calcium aluminum hydrates (CAHs).",Environmental science and pollution research international,"['D060105', 'D000818', 'D001151', 'D002119', 'D017610', 'D003031', 'D003300', 'D004787', 'D007854', 'D010125', 'D012722', 'D017640', 'D012989', 'D013052']","['Animal Shells', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Calcium Carbonate', 'Calcium Compounds', 'Coal', 'Copper', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Lead', 'Ostreidae', 'Sewage', 'Silicates', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission']","Assessment of waste oyster shells and coal mine drainage sludge for the stabilization of As-, Pb-, and Cu-contaminated soil.","['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26411449,2016

Besides the risk for natural contamination of seafood and drinking water, PSTs also pose potent threats through intentional contamination of food, due to their high toxicity and the wide distributions of toxin-producing algae. The new preparation method aim to maintain the samples' original toxin profiles by avoiding conditions known to induce interconversion or degradation of the PSTs. The method was evaluated for PST extraction from water, milk, orange juice, apple purée, baby food, and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). The extracts were found to produce reproducible retention times in HILIC-MS/MS analysis. When an authentic toxic mussel sample was analyzed using the novel method, saxitoxin and gonyautoxin-3 were identified, in agreement with data acquired using the Lawrence pre-column oxidation high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) method.

26284299,"Fish and shellfish are rich in essential nutrients, but are also a source of exposure to environmental contaminants. We aimed to investigate the effect of increased fish and mussel intake on mercury, arsenic, lead and cadmium blood concentrations. We randomly assigned 102 healthy men and women (all non-smokers) aged 48-76 years to an intervention group (n = 51) or a control group (n = 51). Intervention participants received a high amount of fish and mussels for 26 weeks (1 kg week(-1)). Controls received no intervention and were expected to eat less than 300 g of fish and mussels per week. Whole-blood concentrations of mercury, arsenic, lead and cadmium were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. All available observations were included in linear multiple regression analysis to evaluate the effect of the intervention. The difference in mean change for intervention compared with control persons was 5.1 ng ml(-1) (95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.4, 5.8) for mercury, 7.1 ng ml(-1) (95% CI = 5.0, 9.2) for arsenic, and 2.6 ng ml(-1) (95% CI = 0.0, 5.2) for lead. For cadmium, the majority (65%) of the measured concentrations were below the limit of detection of 0.4 ng ml(-1), and the results are therefore not presented. In conclusion, whole-blood concentrations of mercury, arsenic and lead were significantly increased after 26 weeks intervention in this healthy, middle-aged population. The concentrations were not of health concern in this population, except for lead. For lead both the baseline and the post-intervention concentrations were high and exceeded the tolerable concentration levels. ","Food additives & contaminants.

26238596,"There is yet no firm experimental evidence that the evolutionary ancient gonadotropin-releasing hormone GnRH (i.e., GnRH1) also acts in invertebrate gametogenesis. The objective of this paper is to characterize candidate invGnRH peptides of Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis (i.e., peptide identification, immunohistochemical localization, and immunoquantification) in order to reveal their bioactive form in bivalves. Using mass spectrometry (MS), we identified two invGnRH (py-GnRH) peptides from the scallop nerve ganglia: a precursor form of py-GnRH peptide (a non-amidated dodecapeptide; py-GnRH12aa-OH) and a mature py-GnRH peptide (an amidated undecapeptide; py-GnRH11aa-NH2). Immunohistochemical staining allowed the localization of both py-GnRH peptides in the neuronal cell bodies and fibers of the cerebral and pedal ganglia (CPG) and the visceral ganglion (VG). We found that the peptides showed a dimorphic distribution pattern. Notably, the broad distribution of mature py-GnRH in neuronal fibers elongating to peripheral organs suggests that it is multi-functional. Time-resolved fluorescent immunoassays (TR-FIA) enabled the quantification of each py-GnRH form in the single CPG or VG tissue obtained from one individual. In addition, we observed greater abundance of mature py-GnRH in VG compared with its level in CPG, suggesting that VG is the main producing organ of mature py-GnRH peptide and that py-GnRH may play a central regulatory role in neurons of scallops. Our study provides evidence, for the first time, for the presence of precursor and mature forms of invGnRH peptides in the nerve ganglia of an invertebrate.

This was developed following advice published by the Analytical Laboratory Accreditation Criteria Committee and applied to shellfish species that had not been previously subjected to a full single-laboratory validation scheme. The refined approach was developed following the need to assess performance in a number of shellfish species infrequently monitored through the UK statutory monitoring program, while reducing the impact and cost of the studies, most notably in terms of the use of valuable reference standards. The species assessed were manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum), European otter clams (Lutraria lutraria), grooved carpet shell clams (R. decussatus), surf clams (Spisula solida), and king scallops (Pecten maximus) presented as adductor only or adductor plus roe. The method was assessed for sensitivity in terms of LOD and LOQ, toxin recovery, and method precision in each species. It incorporated the PSP toxins deemed toxic and/or prevalent in UK samples and commercially available as certified reference standards. The toxins studied included GTX1-5, dcSTX, STX, C1&2, and NEO. The toxins dcGTX2&3 were included for surf clams due to the prevalence of these toxins in this species as a result of toxin decarbamoylation. Method performance targets were met for each of the characteristics investigated. Consequently, the method was deemed fit for purpose for the screening and quantification of these clam and scallop species for PSP toxins by AOAC Method 2005.06 LC-FLD.

26008234,"During official shellfish control for the presence of marine biotoxins in Greece in year 2012, a series of unexplained positive mouse bioassays (MBA) for lipophilic toxins with nervous symptomatology prior to mice death was observed in mussels from Vistonikos Bay-Lagos, Rodopi. This atypical toxicity coincided with (a) absence or low levels of regulated and some non-regulated toxins in mussels and (b) the simultaneous presence of the potentially toxic microalgal species Prorocentrum minimum at levels up to 1.89 × 103 cells/L in the area's seawater. Further analyses by different MBA protocols indicated that the unknown toxin was hydrophilic, whereas UPLC-MS/MS analyses revealed the presence of tetrodotoxins (TTXs) at levels up to 222.9 μg/kg. Reviewing of official control data from previous years (2006-2012) identified a number of sample cases with atypical positive to asymptomatic negative MBAs for lipophilic toxins in different Greek production areas, coinciding with periods of P. minimum blooms. UPLC-MS/MS analysis of retained sub-samples from these cases revealed that TTXs were already present in Greek shellfish since 2006, in concentrations ranging between 61.0 and 194.7 μg/kg. To our knowledge, this is the earliest reported detection of TTXs in European bivalve shellfish, while it is also the first work to indicate a possible link between presence of the toxic dinoflagellate P. minimum in seawater and that of TTXs in bivalves.

25951406,"Outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections are most frequently associated with the consumption of contaminated oysters. A rapid and selective concentration method is necessary for the recovery of HAV from contaminated oysters prior to detection using PCR. In this study, ricin extracted from castor beans (Ricinus communis) was tested as an alternative to antibody used in immunomagnetic separation while concentrating HAV prior to its detection using reverse transcription PCR. Initially, the extracted proteins from castor beans were fractionated into 13 fractions by gel filtration chromatography. Pretreatment of different protein fractions showed a variation in binding of HAV viral protein (VP) 1 to oyster digestive tissue in the range of 25.9 to 63.9%. The protein fraction, which caused the highest reduction in binding of VP1 to the tissue, was identified as ricin A by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Ricin A could significantly inhibit binding of VP1 to the tissue with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 4.5 μg/ml and a maximal inhibitory concentration of 105.2%. The result showed that the rate of inhibition of HAV binding to tissue was higher compared to the rate of ricin itself binding to HAV (slope: 0.0029 versus 0.00059). However, ricin A concentration showed a higher correlation to the relative binding of ricin itself to HAV than the inhibition of binding of HAV to the tissue (coefficient of determination, R(2): 0.9739 versus 0.6804). In conclusion, ricin A-linked magnetic bead separation combined with reverse transcription PCR can successfully detect HAV in artificially seeded oyster digestive tissue up to a 10(-4) dilution of the virus stock (titer: 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective dose per ml).

25905756,"A collaborative study was conducted to determine selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their relevant alkyl homologs in seafood matrixes using a fast sample preparation method followed by analysis with GC/MS. The sample preparation method involves addition of (13)C-PAH surrogate mixture to homogenized samples and extraction by shaking with a water-ethyl acetate mixture. After phase separation induced by addition of anhydrous magnesium sulfate-sodium chloride (2 + 1, w/w) and centrifugation, an aliquot of the ethyl acetate layer is evaporated, reconstituted in hexane, and cleaned up using silica gel SPE. The analytes are eluted with hexane-dichloromethane (3 + 1, v/v), the clean extract is carefully evaporated, reconstituted in isooctane, and analyzed by GC/MS. To allow for the use of various GC/MS instruments, GC columns, silica SPE cartridges, and evaporation techniques and equipment, performance-based criteria were developed and implemented in the qualification phase of the collaborative study. These criteria helped laboratories optimize their GC/MS, SPE cleanup, and evaporation conditions; check and eliminate potential PAH contamination in their reagent blanks; and become familiar with the method procedure. Ten laboratories from five countries qualified and completed the collaborative study, which was conducted on three seafood matrixes (mussel, oyster, and shrimp) fortified with 19 selected PAH analytes at five different levels of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) ranging from 2 to 50 μg/kg. Each matrix had a varying mixture of three different BaP levels. The other studied PAHs were at varying levels from 2 to 250 μg/kg to mimic typical PAH patterns. The fortified analytes in three matrixes were analyzed as blind duplicates at each level of BaP and corresponding other PAH levels. In addition, a blank with no added PAHs for each matrix was analyzed singly. Eight to 10 valid results were obtained for the majority of determinations. Mean recoveries of all tested analytes at the five different concentration levels were all in the range of 70-120%: 83.8-115% in shrimp, 77.3-107% in mussel, and 71.6-94.6% in oyster, except for a slightly lower mean recovery of 68.6% for benzo[ a ]anthracene fortified at 25 μg/kg in oyster (RSDr: 5.84%, RSDR: 21.1%) and lower mean recoveries for anthracene (Ant) and BaP in oyster at all three fortification levels (50.3-56.5% and 48.2-49.7%, respectively). The lower mean recoveries of Ant and BaP were linked to degradation of these analytes in oyster samples stored at -20°C, which also resulted in lower reproducibility (RSDR values in the range of 44.5-64.7% for Ant and 40.6-43.5% for BaP). However, the repeatability was good (RSDr of 8.78-9.96% for Ant and 6.43-11.9% for BaP), and the HorRat values were acceptable (1.56-1.94 for Ant and 1.10-1.45 for BaP). In all other cases, repeatability, reproducibility, and HorRat values were as follows: shrimp: RSDr 1.40-26.9%, RSDR 5.41-29.4%, HorRat: 0.22-1.34; mussel: RSDr 2.52-17.1%, RSDR 4.19-32.5%, HorRat: 0.17-1.13; and oyster: RSDr 3.12-22.7%, RSDR 8.41-31.8%, HorRat: 0.34-1.39.

25796529,"A headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) method is described, to screen seafood for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with petrochemical taint. VOCs are extracted from the headspace of heated sample homogenates by adsorption onto a SPME fiber and desorbed for analysis by GC-MS. Targeted compounds are determined semi-quantitatively using representative calibration standards for the various classes (alkanes, alkylbenzenes, indanes/tetralins, and naphthalenes) of VOCs analyzed. Sample preparation is minimal, and the analyses are rapid and automated with a capacity of 50 samples per day. The method was optimized in terms of headspace temperature, sample heating time, extraction time, and desorption time using oyster samples fortified with target compounds. Calibrations for hydrocarbon components were linear in the range of 8.3-167 ng/g; the limit of detection ranged between 0.05 and 0.21 ng/g, and the limit of quantitation between 0.16 and 0.69 ng/g. Good precision (RSD < 10 % at 16.7 ng/g for individual VOCs) and accuracy (recovery range 89-118 % at 25 ng/g) were obtained in oyster, crab, shrimp, and finfish matrices. The trueness of the method was demonstrated by quantifying VOCs at 1-2-ppb levels in oyster fortified with certified reference material NIST SRM 1491a. Following single laboratory validation, the method was employed for the determination of VOCs in seafood exposed to oil contaminated seawater and for the determination of background VOC levels in seafood species from the Gulf of Mexico and local food stores.

In our study two extraction methodologies were compared and different clean-up strategies were also studied in order to develop a reliable analytical method, with minimum matrix effect and good detection limits, to determine synthetic musk fragrances- six polycyclic musks, three nitro musks and the degradation product of one polycyclic musk- in fish and mussel samples. The first extraction technique involves a QuEChERS extraction, a consolidate extraction methodology in the field of food analysis of growing interest over recent years, followed by a dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE) as clean-up strategy. The second extraction technique consists of a conventional pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) with dichloromethane and an in-cell clean-up to decrease the matrix effect and remove the undesired components(⁎)present in PLE extracts. Large volume injection (LVI) followed by gas chromatography-ion trap-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-IT-MS/MS) was chosen as the separation and detection technique. Validation parameters, such as method detection limits and method quantification limits were found at ng g(-1) levels for both fish and mussel matrices.

In addition, C. palmula oysters were sampled at 9 sites from the same mangrove roots where C. corteziensis oysters were collected. Metal analyses were performed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Cd, Cu, and Zn), graphite furnace (Pb), and cold vapor detection (Hg). The obtained mean levels were (µg g(-1) dry weight) as follows: Cd 6.05 ± 2.77, Cu 60.0 ± 33.4, Hg 0.38 ± 0.17, Pb 1.11 ± 0.63, and Zn 777 ± 528 µg g(-1). For all metals except Hg, the concentrations were greater during dry season than during rainy seasons. The high levels, particularly that for Cd, were related to upwelling along the eastern Gulf of California. High Hg levels in the rainy season were associated with the transport of materials from the watershed to the lagoon. Shrimp farming, agriculture, and other sources were considered as potential sources to explain the differences in metal bioavailability in the 8 lagoons. The mean concentrations of Cd (Santa María-La Reforma lagoon), Cu [San Ignacio-Navachiste-El Macapule (SINM), Urías (URI), and Altata-Ensenada del Pabellón lagoons], and zinc (Zn) (URI, Santa María-Ohuira-Topolobampo, El Colorado, and SINM lagoons) during the dry season were greater than the maximum permissible limits.

25313153,"Though pharmaceuticals are increasingly observed in a variety of organisms from coastal and inland aquatic systems, trophic transfer of pharmaceuticals in aquatic food webs have not been reported. In this study, bioaccumulation of select pharmaceuticals was investigated in a lower order effluent-dependent stream in central Texas, USA, using isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS). A fish plasma model, initially developed from laboratory studies, was tested to examine observed versus predicted internal dose of select pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals accumulated to higher concentrations in invertebrates relative to fish; elevated concentrations of the antidepressant sertraline and its primary metabolite desmethylsertraline were observed in the Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea, and two unionid mussel species. Trophic positions were determined from stable isotopes (δ(15)N and δ(13)C) collected by isotope ratio-MS; a Bayesian mixing model was then used to estimate diet contributions towards top fish predators. Because diphenhydramine and carbamazepine were the only target compounds detected in all species examined, trophic magnification factors (TMFs) were derived to evaluate potential trophic transfer of both compounds. TMFs for diphenhydramine (0.38) and carbamazepine (1.17) indicated neither compound experienced trophic magnification, which suggests that inhalational and not dietary exposure represented the primary route of uptake by fish in this effluent-dependent stream.

Decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) among the many STX analogues was selected as an external standard to identify and quantify STX. The retention time of STX in shellfish extracts by HPLC-FD was reproducibly estimated by using the retention time of dcSTX and the separation factor (α) between STX and dcSTX. Almost all of the columns tested to setup the method were useful to identify STX. Because a molar fluorescent coefficient of dcSTX was slightly different from that of STX, a factor used to correct the fluorescent coefficient in STX/dcSTX was determined to be 1.30.

A major advantage of the method is that it can detect members of all six groups of lipophilic marine biotoxins [okadaic acid (OA), yessotoxins (YTX), azaspiracids (AZA), pectenotoxins (PTX), cyclic imines (CI), and brevetoxins (PbTx)], thereby allowing quantification and high confidence identification from a single liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) injection. An enhanced product ion (EPI) library was constructed after triggered collection of data via information-dependent acquisition (IDA) of EPI spectra from standard samples. A separation method for identifying 17 target toxins in a single analysis within 12min was developed and tested. Different solid phase extraction sorbents, the matrix effect (for oyster, scallop, and mussel samples), and stability of the standards also were evaluated. Matrix-matched calibration was used for quantification of the toxins. The limits of detection were 0.12-13.6μg/kg, and the limits of quantification were 0.39-45.4μg/kg. The method was used to analyze 120 shellfish samples collected from farming areas along the coast of China, and 7% of the samples were found to be contaminated with toxins. The library search identified PbTx-3, YTX, OA, PTX2, AZA1, AZA2, and desmethylspirolide C (SPX1).

24720970,"Regulatory authorities are expected to measure concentration of contaminants in foodstuffs, but the simple determination of total amount cannot be sufficient for fully judging its impact on the human health. In particular, the methylation of metals generally increases their toxicity; therefore validated analytical methods producing reliable results for the assessment of methylated species are highly needed. Nowadays, there is no legal limit for methylmercury (MeHg) in food matrices. Hence, no standardized method for the determination of MeHg exists within the international jurisdiction. Contemplating the possibility of a future legislative limit, a method for low level determination of MeHg in marine biota matrixes, based on aqueous-phase ethylation followed by purge and trap and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to pyrolysis-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (Py-AFS) detection, has been developed and validated. Five different extraction procedures, namely acid and alkaline leaching assisted by microwave and conventional oven heating, as well as enzymatic digestion, were evaluated in terms of their efficiency to extract MeHg from Scallop soft tissue IAEA-452 Certified Reference Material. Alkaline extraction with 25% (w/w) KOH in methanol, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) with 5M HCl and enzymatic digestion with protease XIV yielded the highest extraction recoveries. Standard addition or the introduction of a dilution step were successfully applied to overcome the matrix effects observed when microwave-assisted extraction using 25% (w/w) KOH in methanol or 25% (w/v) aqueous TMAH were used. ISO 17025 and Eurachem guidelines were followed to perform the validation of the methodology. Accordingly, blanks, selectivity, calibration curve, linearity (0.9995), working range (1-800pg), recovery (97%), precision, traceability, limit of detection (0.45pg), limit of quantification (0.85pg) and expanded uncertainty (15.86%, k=2) were assessed with Fish protein Dorm-3 Certified Reference Material. The major contributions to the expanded uncertainty, i.e. 86.1%, arose from the uncertainty associated with recovery, followed by the contribution from fluorescence signal.

24593147,"Arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg) associated with geothermally influenced lakes and rivers represent a potential health risk to communities where wild-caught food is consumed. The Rotorua Lakes region of New Zealand has extensive natural geothermal activity and a large proportion (35%) of indigenous Māori population, for whom wild food gathering is an important cultural activity. The aim of this study was to measure selected heavy metal and organochlorine (OC) concentrations in important local fish and shellfish species and assess the potential health risk to the local population of consuming these species. Following U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) protocols, consumption limits were calculated based on both excess lifetime cancer risk and noncancer risk. These were compared with local consumption rates, which were determined by questionnaire (n = 19). Median and 95th percentile contaminant concentrations were calculated to approximate random and most extreme contaminant consumption scenarios. Only Hg concentrations exceeded established Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) guideline values of 0.5 mg/kg, namely, for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; 62% of the study sites) and koura (freshwater crayfish; Paranephrops planifrons; 25% of sites). The major risk was from consumption of trout, where the local consumption rate (1.5 meals/mo) exceeded the consumption limit of 0.9 meals/mo (median data) and 0.4 meals/mo (95th percentile data). Shellfish--pipi (Paphies australis) and mussel (Perna canaliculus)--collected from the only estuarine site also had local consumption rates (3.5 meals/mo) above calculated consumption limits (2.6 and 2.9 meals/mo, respectively). Our results, while based on a limited sample size and therefore exploratory in nature, nevertheless provide the basis for developing consumption guidelines.

In the present study, the expression profiles of proteins in the hepatopancreas of scallop Chlamys farreri were examined to reveal the possible mechanisms of physiological responses of scallop beneath heat stress and bacterial infection. An earlier occurred and higher mortality was observed in the scallops from combination treated group (28 °C and an injection of Vibrio anguillarum) in comparison to those in heat stress (28 °C) and bacteria challenge (V. anguillarum injection only) group, as well as control (PBS) and blank (untreated) group. The proteins in the hepatopancreas from scallops post 6 h of treatment were analyzed by using 2-D PAGE and ImageMaster 2D Platinum. There were total 1003 spots detected in control group, 1193 spots in heat stress group, 1263 spots in bacteria challenge group, and 1241 spots in the combination group. Fifteen protein spots expressed differentially between the combination treatment group and the bacteria challenge group were successfully identified by mass spectrometry and they were mainly classified as binding and catalytic proteins, such as endoglucanase, methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, xylose isomerase, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, 40s ribosomal protein SA, glutathione S-transferase 4, and Mitochondrial transcription factor A, etc. These results indicated that the mortality of scallops suffered from the combination treatment was probably attributed to the impaired modulation of digestion and metabolism and ruined protein synthesis caused by heat stress together with bacteria infection. These data also provided valuable insights into the possible mechanisms of summer mortality occurrence of scallop at protein level.

Several certified reference materials (CRMs) were also included in the sample set for comparison purposes. For these CRMs, the isotopic composition of Zn is expressed as δ-values, calculated with respect to both IRMM-3702 and JMC-ZnLyon, as isotopic standards. The range of δ(66)Zn values observed in food products was approximately 1.9‰. In general, vegetables, cereals and derived products showed an enrichment of the heavier Zn isotopes, whereas a depletion was observed in products of animal origin (meat, fish, egg and semi-skimmed milk), relative to human blood samples. Mussel, however, showed a significant enrichment of the heavier isotopes, which is hypothetically attributed to its accumulation behaviour. Thus, the lower δ(66)Zn values found in food products of animal origin appear to be reflected in the lower δ(66)Zn value observed in blood from an omnivorous population compared to that for a vegetarian population.

24124903,"Some dinoflagellate species within the genera Alexandrium, Gymnodinium and Pyrodinium are well-known producers of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), which led to many poisoning incidents around the world. In the northern Yellow Sea, an important mariculture zone for scallop Patinopecten yessoensis, PST have been frequently detected from scallops. However, there is little knowledge concerning PST-producing microalgae in this region so far. In cruises carried out in 2011 and 2012, scallop and phytoplankton samples were collected from the northern Yellow Sea. PST were detected from scallops by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). Toxin content and profile were remarkably different among the four tissues, i.e. viscera, adductor muscle, mantle and gonad, suggesting apparent toxin transfer and transformation in scallops. Viscera always had the highest content of PST dominated by low-potency N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins C1 and C2, which closely resembled the toxin profiles of net-concentrated phytoplankton samples in spring. Based on the morphological features, cells of Alexandrium spp. in net-concentrated phytoplankton samples were picked out and a partial sequence of the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (LSU rDNA) was amplified using a single-cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Cells of both toxic A. tamarense species complex and non-toxic A. affine were identified from the phytoplankton samples based on the partial LSU rDNA sequence information. According to these findings, it is implied that A. tamarense species complex is the major toxic species related to PST contamination in scallops of the northern Yellow Sea. The presence of both toxic and non-toxic Alexandrium spp. in this region requires for a species-specific method to monitor the distribution and dynamics of A. tamarense species complex.

In contrast to the other mass spectrometer parameters (nebulizer gas pressure, vaporizer temperature, corona current) as well as on-line preconcentration parameter (the ACN level in the sample matrix), the sheath liquid composition (methanol/water in the ratio of 3:1) and the sample injection time (40 min) were found as the predominant factors that control the sensitivity of PAHs determination. Finally, this on-line preconcentration CEC-APCI-MS method determined PAH residues in seafood samples successfully with as low as 10 ng/g level.",Journal of chromatography.

23834810,"Arsenic toxicity to humans critically depends on the chemical form of the arsenic. The Expert Committee of the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization defined a tolerable intake only for inorganic arsenic, although the toxicity of some organoarsenic compounds is known. Arsenobetaine (AsB), arsenocholine (AsC), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) are abundant in shellfish. We present a fast and reliable method for identification of the type of organic arsenic in mussels by using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry on triple quadrupole with parallel determination of total arsenic by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The method was validated by evaluating mean recoveries, repeatability, specificity, limits of quantification, and limits of detection that produced satisfactory results. The method was used to carry out the first survey of the concentrations of AsB, AsC, MMA, and DMA in seafood from southern Italy. Total As concentrations ranged from 1.38 to 12.79 mg/kg. AsB and DMA were detected in all samples (AsB: 0.72 to 10.36 mg/kg; DMA: 0.28 to 1.08 mg/kg), and concentrations of AsC and MMA ranged from 0.20 to 1.53 mg/kg. This method allowed us to rapidly and inexpensively identify arsenic types in fishery products and would be suitable for routine detection of organoarsenic compounds in molluscs.

The WOS, serving as the primary stabilizing agent, was pre-treated at a high temperature to activate quicklime from calcite. Class C FA was used as a secondary additive along with the calcined oyster shells (COS). The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by means of the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and the 0.1 M HCl extraction tests following a curing period of 28 days. The combined treatment with 10 wt% COS and 5 wt% FA cause a significant reduction in Pb (>98 %) and Cu (>96 %) leachability which was indicated by the results from both extraction tests (TCLP and 0.1 M HCl). Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analyses are used to investigate the mechanism responsible for Pb and Cu stabilization. SEM-EDX results indicate that effective Pb and Cu immobilization using the combined COS-FA treatment is most probably associated with ettringite and pozzolanic reaction products.

23665239,"Ag NPs are one of the most commonly used NPs in nanotechnology whose environmental impacts are to date unknown and the information about bioavailability, mechanisms of biological uptake and toxic implications in organisms is scarce. So, the main objective of this study was to investigate differences in protein expression profiles in gills and digestive gland of mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to Ag NPs and Ag(+) (10 μg L(-1)) for a period of 15 days. Protein expression profiles of exposed gills and digestive glands were compared to those of control mussels using two-dimensional electrophoresis to discriminate differentially expressed proteins. Different patterns of protein expression were obtained for exposed mussels, dependent not only on the different redox requirements of each tissue but also to the Ag form used. Unique sets of differentially expressed proteins were affected by each silver form in addition to proteins that were affected by both Ag NPs and Ag(+). Fifteen of these proteins were subsequently identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF and database search. Ag NPs affected similar cellular pathways as Ag(+), with common response mechanisms in cytoskeleton and cell structure (catchin, myosin heavy chain), stress response (heat shock protein 70), oxidative stress (glutathione s-transferase), transcriptional regulation (nuclear receptor subfamily 1G), adhesion and mobility (precollagen-P) and energy metabolism (ATP synthase F0 subunit 6 and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2). Exposure to Ag NPs altered the expression of two proteins associated with stress response (major vault protein and ras partial) and one protein involved in cytoskeleton and cell structure (paramyosin), while exposure to Ag(+) had a strong influence in one protein related to stress response (putative c1q domain containing protein) and two proteins involved in cytoskeleton and cell structure (actin and α-tubulin). Protein identification showed that Ag NPs toxicity is mediated by oxidative stress-induced cell signalling cascades (including mitochondria and nucleus) that can lead to cell death. This toxicity represents the cumulative effect of Ag(+) released from the particles and other properties as particle size and surface reactivity. This study helped to unravel the molecular mechanisms that can be associated with Ag NPs toxicity; nevertheless, some additional studies are required to investigate the exact interaction between these NPs and cellular components.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000818', 'D015180', 'D004785', 'D005786', 'D005880', 'D013058', 'D053768', 'D049878', 'D040901', 'D012834', 'D013054']","['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gills', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metal Nanoparticles', 'Mytilus', 'Proteomics', 'Silver', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",Differential protein expression in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to nano and ionic Ag.,"[None, None, 'Q000633', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000633', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000633', None]","[None, None, 'toxicity', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, 'toxicity', 'metabolism', None, 'toxicity', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23665239,2013

Both proteomic and metabolomic responses indicated that varying salinities could significantly affect the toxicological responses of clams to As. Metabolic biomarkers revealed that the environmentally relevant arsenic (20 μg L(-1)) exposure induced disturbance in energy metabolism and/or osmotic regulation under different salinities, whereas protein biomarkers indicated oxidative stress, cellular injury and apoptosis and disturbance in energy metabolism. In addition, the up-regulated proteins including ATP synthase, succinyl-CoA synthetase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase were validated by related metabolites, succinate and ATP, which confirmed the disturbance in energy metabolism in clam gills at low salinity (15.6 psu).

Kinetic parameters of the PHE bioaccumulation and depuration were calculated for an 11-day uptake and subsequent 11-day depuration periods. Those values of kinetic rate constants for uptake and depuration of PHE were calculated as varying between 93-177 and 0.18-0.25, respectively. Negative correlation was observed between the PHE concentrations and kinetic rate constants. Bioaccumulation Factors (BAFs) for the mussels exposed to different PHE concentrations were calculated from both kinetic rate constants and from the experimental data and found between 509-701 and 441-658, respectively. Experimental quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) values for PHE were found comparable to the calculated QSARs reported in literature. Two sub-lethal biomarker methods (filtration rate and lysosomal stability) were applied to observe the responses of the mussels throughout the experimental period.

These naturally contaminated prey were fed to a marine neogastropod Nassarius siquijorensis for a period of up to 7 weeks. We then investigated the influences of prey type, metal burden, and subcellular distribution in the prey on the metal accumulation, trophic transfer, and potential toxicity on N. siquijorensis. We demonstrated an obvious negative relationship between the trophic transfer and the metal concentration in prey or the metal dosage. N. siquijorensis exhibited food avoidance behavior to the Cu contaminated food, which effectively reduced the metal ingestion and resulted in a decrease of trophic transfer, as well as a potential toxic effect from dietary exposure. On the other hand, our results also implied the metal-specific impact of subcellular metal distribution in prey on the trophic transfer to N. siquijorensis.

The stability of Ag NPs in seawater was examined using dynamic light scattering. Release of soluble Ag from Ag NPs in the experimental media was quantified by using diffusive gradient in thin film. Bioaccumulation of Ag in bivalves was measured by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. Behavioural and biochemical biomarkers were determined in bivalves. Aggregation of Ag NPs and the release of soluble Ag from Ag NPs were observed in the experimental media. For both forms of Ag, bioaccumulation was much more important for waterborne than for dietary exposure. The response of oxidative stress biomarkers (catalase, glutathion S-transferase, superoxide dismutase) was more important after dietary than waterborne exposure to Ag (soluble and NPs). These defences were relatively efficient since they led to a lack of response of damage biomarkers. Burrowing was not affected for bivalves exposed directly or through the diet to both Ag forms but feeding behaviour was impaired after 10 days of dietary exposure.

23108980,"Bioaccumulation of PFAS in aquatic organisms is an environmental problem of growing concern around the world. This problem has been tackled by regulatory bodies by proposing EQS for biota in EU water bodies and tolerable daily intake for food. The introduction of regulatory limits requires the availability of harmonised and validated analytical methods of sufficient sensitivity. This paper reviews recent advances in analytical methods for analysis of PFAS in aquatic organisms. The methods available for biota analysis are mostly based on three extraction procedures: ion-pair extraction, solvent liquid extraction, and alkaline digestion. The resulting extracts are then subjected to different clean-up or enrichment steps on solid adsorbents, for example graphitized carbon black, C(18), and WAX phases. All methods reviewed in this work give reliable results but are partially validated only, because of the lack of certified reference materials and regular interlaboratory exercises.

23054777,"Because sponges are promising bioindicators, we present here a multispecies comparison of the bioconcentration capacity for copper, zinc and the hydrocarbon fluoranthene. The spatial distribution of sponge populations was studied in 17 areas in intertidal zones on the Lower Normandy coast (France) to determine the most common species with the highest bioaccumulation capacity. Results are compared with published data on blue mussels Mytilus edulis from the Réseau d'Observation de la Contamination Chimique biomonitoring network. A total of 720 sponge samples were collected to assess species richness. Samples were analysed for metal concentrations by flame-mode atomic absorption spectrometry. Analyses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were sub-contracted. Species richness varies according to the water mass concerned. The most common species in the study area showing the highest bioconcentration in its soft tissues is Hymeniacidon perlevis, which contains about 20 times the zinc, 44 times the copper and 16 times the fluoranthene levels found in mussels. The variability of contaminant concentrations in H. perlevis is also systematically higher than those in mussels. The results obtained for this sponge closely reflect the heterogeneous distribution of contaminants. This study demonstrates that H. perlevis has a much higher capacity to accumulate in situ contaminants than the blue mussel M. edulis. H. perlevis meets all the requirements of a good bioindicator suitable for use in an integrated monitoring programme. In the near future, controlled cultivation of H. perlevis will allow us to produce sufficient quantities of this species to carry out ecotoxicological tests and in situ biomonitoring by caging.",Environmental science and pollution research international,"['D000818', 'D003300', 'D004781', 'D004784', 'D005449', 'D005602', 'D008401', 'D008670', 'D011161', 'D012621', 'D013045', 'D013054', 'D014874', 'D060753', 'D015032']","['Animals', 'Copper', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Fluorenes', 'France', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Metals', 'Porifera', 'Seasons', 'Species Specificity', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Water Quality', 'Zinc']","The porifera Hymeniacidon perlevis (Montagu, 1818) as a bioindicator for water quality monitoring.","[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'methods', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23054777,2013

The southeast population, P.o. carolinensis, was delisted in 1985, while the west coast population, P.o. californicus, was not delisted until 2009. As fish-eating coastal seabirds, brown pelicans may serve as a biomonitors. Organic contaminants were examined in brown pelican eggs collected from the Gulf of California in 2004 and South Carolina in 2005 using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Contaminants were compared using all individual data as well as statistically pooled samples to provide similar sample sizes with little difference in results.

23000641,"In bivalves, serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, 5-HT) acts as a major promotional factor in oocyte maturation, sperm motility, and sequential spawning. The previously reported novel neuronal protein, oocyte maturation arresting factor (OMAF) that was found in the central nervous system and hemolymph of the Japanese scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis, has an inhibitory activity in the 5-HT-induced oocyte maturation via a receptor-mediated mechanism, resulting in an arrest of spawning [30]. In this study, OMAF protein was isolated from the supernatant of hemolymph of the scallop using gel and anion-exchange chromatography, and SDS-PAGE. Three digested partial peptides with 4, 11, and 16 amino acid residues were determined through reversed-phase HPLC and amino acid sequencing. The anti-OMAF antibodies generated against the obtained peptides with 11 and 16 amino acid residues were applied to immunohistochemistry and 5-HT-induced spawning and oocyte maturation assays. Fusiform OMAF neurons were localized in the external area of the anterior lobe of the cerebral ganglion, supporting our presumption that OMAF was secreted from the cerebral and pedal ganglia (CPG). Pretreatment with anti-OMAF antibody on three kinds of bivalve species showed a strong in vivo amplification of 5-HT-induced release of egg and sperm, and an in vitro restoration of 5-HT-induced germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) from inhibition by the CPG extract, suggesting the release from suppressive activity of OMAF due to the absorption with antibody.

22970577,"The bioaccumulation of paralytic shellfish toxins in mussels, oysters, cockles, hard clams, razors, and king scallops is monitored in England, Scotland, and Wales by AOAC Official Method 2005.06 LC-with fluorescence detection (FLD). One of the commonly perceived disadvantages of using this method is the long turnaround time and low throughput in a busy laboratory environment. The chromatographic analysis of each sample typically utilizes a 15 min cycle time to achieve toxin oxidation product separation and column equilibration prior to subsequent analysis. A standard RP C18 analytical column, used successfully in recent years, achieves good separation with a long column lifetime. The analysis of a 40 sample qualitative screening batch takes approximately 18 h, including blanks, standards, and other QC samples. The availability of superficially porous column technology has offered the potential to reduce analysis time while retaining column performance on existing hardware. In this study, AOAC Official Method 2005.06 with LC-FLD was transferred to two different commercially available superficially porous columns, and the method performance characteristics were evaluated. Both columns separated all toxins adequately with cycle times less than half that of the existing method. Linearity for each toxin was acceptable up to two times the European maximum permitted limit of 800 microg di-HCl saxitoxin equivalent/kg flesh. LOD and LOQ values were substantially improved for the majority of toxins, with gonyautoxin 1&4 and neosaxitoxin showing up to a two- and fourfold improvement, respectively, depending on the column used. Quantification results obtained from parallel analysis of contaminated samples were acceptable on both columns. Comparative screen results gave a slight increase in the occurrence of contaminated samples, which was attributed to the improved detection limit for most toxins. Issues with rapidly increasing back pressure, however, were identified with both columns, with a limit of around 500 injections. This compares to the >3000 cycles routinely obtained with the standard RP-C18 HPLC columns currently in use. Overall, the gain achieved with these columns through shorter analysis time and improved analytical sensitivity is potentially of benefit in a high-throughput environment.

Cadmium was extracted with 0.l mol L(-1) HCl from oysters and cleaned up from other metals by the use of an anion-exchange column. The behavior of five metals Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Cd was monitored at each step of extraction and clean-up procedure for the ICA method in an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. The results revealed that a simple extraction method with the HCl solution was efficient enough to extract almost all of cadmium from oysters. Clean-up with an anion-exchange column presented almost no loss of cadmium adsorbed on the column and an efficient removal of metals other than cadmium.

We performed short-term feeding experiments to examine ingestion, accumulation, biotransformation, histopathology, and paralysis in the juvenile Pacific calico scallop Argopecten ventricosus that consume this dinoflagellate. Depletion of algal cells was measured in closed systems. Histopathological preparations were microscopically analyzed. Paralysis was observed and the time of recovery recorded. Accumulation and possible biotransformation of toxins were measured by HPLC analysis. Feeding activity in treated scallops showed that scallops produced pseudofeces, ingestion rates decreased at 8 h; approximately 60% of the scallops were paralyzed and melanin production and hemocyte aggregation were observed in several tissues at 15 h. HPLC analysis showed that the only toxins present in the dinoflagellates and scallops were the N-sulfo-carbamoyl toxins (C1, C2); after hydrolysis, the carbamate toxins (epimers GTX2/3) were present. C1 and C2 toxins were most common in the mantle, followed by the digestive gland and stomach-complex, adductor muscle, kidney and rectum group, and finally, gills.

PAHs were recovered from the sediments and biota by ultrasonic extraction and then analyzed by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The total PAH concentrations were 244-713 ng/g dw in sediments, 82.8-415 ng/g dw in plants and 207-4,780 ng/g dw in animals. The total sediment PAH concentrations were categorized as lower to moderate contamination compared with other regions of China and the world. In the plant samples, the accumulation abilities of reed roots and stems for PAHs were higher than those of grass roots. In addition, the concentration of individual PAHs in mussel muscles was the highest in all of the animal samples, followed by fish, feeding crane fetuses, and wild crane fetuses. Compositional analysis suggests that the PAHs in the sediments from the Zha Long Wetland were derived from incomplete biomass combustion. Risk assessment shows that the levels of PAHs in sediments are mostly lower than the effects range mean value (effects range mean), whereas only naphthalene in all sample sites was higher than the effects range low value.

Recent reports indicate that C. fluminea has many bioactivities, but it remains unknown whether C. fluminea affects inflammation. This study explored the anti-inflammatory activity of C. fluminea. C. fluminea was first treated with chloroform to obtain clam chloroform extracts (CCEs). On the basis of the assay for the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo, the results show that the CCEs significantly lowered the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, the CCEs reduced LPS-induced organ damage. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that CCEs inhibit the LPS-induced mRNA expression of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α. Western blot analysis indicated that the CCEs increased expression of IκB and attenuated the phosphorylation of IκB.

22468351,"AOAC Official Method 2005.06 LC-fluorescence detection (FLD) method is an official alternative to the mouse bioassay for the determination of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins in bivalve shellfish. To validate the method for species of relevance to the UK official control monitoring program, the method performance characteristics were tested for whole king and queen scallops. Validation showed that, while the performance was generally acceptable for the quantitation of non-N-hydroxylated toxins, poor toxin recovery and sensitivity was evident for the analysis of N-hydroxylated toxins following periodate oxidation. These effects occurred in a range of scallop samples with variable temporal and spatial sources. The effects were also noted in other laboratories following a small interlaboratory study. As a result, the method was refined to improve the recovery and sensitivity of analysis following the periodate oxidation step in the PSP method for scallops. Performance improved through alterations to the preparation of the periodate oxidant, use of higher volumes for C18 cleanup, and injection volumes in combination with the use of a king scallop matrix modifier for oxidation of N-hydroxylated toxin calibration standards. A single-laboratory validation of the refined method showed that the selectivity, linearity, sensitivity, recovery, and precision were acceptable and similar to values reported previously for AOAC Official Method 2005.06 in other bivalve species. Results showed the method to be rugged for all parameters investigated, including small changes to the composition of the new periodate reagent utilized in the refined method. The refined scallops LC method was subsequently compared with the European reference method. PSP-positive scallops showed an excellent agreement between the methods for queen and Atlantic scallops, with a small level of positive bias in the LC results for whole king scallops. These differences were related solely to the use of the highest toxicity equivalence factors for toxin epimeric pairs, with gonyautoxin (GTX)1,4 and GTX2,3 in particular present at high concentrations in the king scallops. Overall, the refined LC-FLD method improved the performance characteristics of AOAC Official Method 2005.06 for the determination of PSP toxins in whole king and queen scallops, and showed a good overall agreement between the official methodologies.

The mRNA expressions of 12 differential proteins were analyzed using quantitative PCR, and 10 showed consistent alteration of mRNA level with that of protein expression level. Altered expressions of two proteins (mitochondrial processing peptidase and α-tubulin) were also examined using Western blotting, showing that the mitochondrial processing peptidase was down-regulated but α-tubulin remained unchanged in response to MP exposure. Subcellular locations of all the identified proteins that were predicted using bioinformatics tools indicate that few of them are permanently located in the membrane. The differentially expressed proteins are involved in several critical biological processes, and their relevance to human health has been illuminated.

A palladium solution was used as a chemical modifier. The instrumental conditions, such as carrier gas flow rate, RF power, pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures and argon internal flow rate during vaporization were optimized.

Eleven protein spots were observed to be significantly changed in the OG feeding with C. vulgaris-Cd, which seven spots of these differential proteins were down-regulated while four spots were up-regulated. These altered spots were further excised in gels and identified by a combined technique of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) and database searching. A portion of these differential proteins were further proofed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. The results indicate that the major functions of these differential proteins were described as follows: binding, protein translocation, catalysis, regulation of energy metabolism, reproductive function and skeleton structure. These differential proteins in part may effectively provide a few novel biomarkers for the evaluation of Cd pollution level via a food pathway for harming halobios, mammal and human health, and for understanding the complex mechanisms of Cd toxicity in vivo.",Chemosphere,"['D000818', 'D002104', 'D015870', 'D058086', 'D010125', 'D020543', 'D012333', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Cadmium', 'Gene Expression', 'Microalgae', 'Ostreidae', 'Proteome', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Gonad differential proteins revealed with proteomics in oyster (Saccostrea cucullata) using alga as food contaminated with cadmium.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', 'drug effects', None, 'drug effects', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22230729,2012

This article evaluated the residue levels of 51 pesticides and 16 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in selected fish and food items which were commonly consumed in the Nantong area of Jiangsu Province, Southeast China. The 51 pesticides and 16 PCBs were analyzed by highly sensitive gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The results showed that organochlorine pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and mirex and other pesticides including chlorpyrifos, pyrethroid pesticides, metolachlor, pyridaben and trifluralin were frequently detected in the samples, which was consistent with the accumulation level and characteristics of these toxic chemicals in human adipose tissue of people living in Nantong. Meanwhile, correlation of the residue level of toxic chemicals with their physical chemical properties and historic use pattern in Nantong area was observed. Combined with dietary survey results at the same sampling locations, human health risk assessment of ingestion through the dietary route was performed.

22186054,"To better understand critical aspects of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) occurrence in a chief producing region of bivalves in Korea, the geographical and annual variation of DSP toxins and other lipophilic toxins in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and oysters (Crassostrea  gigas) were investigated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in an area on the south coast of Korea from 2007 to 2009. The total lipophilic shellfish toxin (LST) levels in bivalves showed geographical and annual variations. LSTs were detected mostly in the hepatopancreas  of mussels from Jinhae Bay throughout the entire year, except in November and December of 2007, but were almost undetectable in all samples during the entire year in 2009. The peak DSP toxin (okadaic acid plus dinophysistoxin 1) levels in the hepatopancreas of mussels from Jinhae Bay and the  Tongyeong region were 945.3 and 37.6 ng/g, respectively. The DSP toxin content was about 10 times higher in mussels than in oysters collected from the same region. The major toxins in bivalves were okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin 1; however, pectenotoxin 2 or yessotoxin was occasionally detected  as a major component. The results of a quantitative analysis of phytoplankton showed that Dinophysis acuminata was the most probable source of the LSTs, with the exception of yessotoxin. When the highest DSP toxin level was measured (945.3 ng/g in the hepatopancreas of mussels from  Jinhae Bay), the toxin concentration in whole mussel tissue was calculated to be 114.0 ng/g. The calculated highest DSP toxin level in whole oyster tissue from both regions was 15.0 ng/g. The calculated maximum toxicities in whole mussel and oyster tissues were lower than the regulatory limit  (160 to 200 ng/g) in Korea, the European Union, and the United States. Korean oysters (242 samples) and mussels (214 samples) were thus deemed safe for consumption. But because such variation was detected in a relatively small area of the coast, it is possible that at some locations or during  a specific period LST levels could exceed the standard and a few consumers could be at risk of experiencing DSP.",Journal of food protection,"['D000818', 'D049872', 'D003257', 'D003967', 'D059022', 'D006801', 'D007723', 'D010125', 'D012621', 'D012758', 'D057096', 'D013045', 'D053719']","['Animals', 'Bivalvia', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Diarrhea', 'Food Safety', 'Humans', 'Korea', 'Ostreidae', 'Seasons', 'Shellfish', 'Shellfish Poisoning', 'Species Specificity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Geographical and annual variation in lipophilic shellfish toxins from oysters and mussels along the south coast of Korea.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000453', None, None, 'Q000453', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000453', None, None]","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'epidemiology', None, None, 'epidemiology', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'epidemiology', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22186054,2012
22138287,"Significant differences previously observed in the determination of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs) in oysters using official method AOAC 2005.06 and 959.08 were investigated in detail with regard to possible matrix effects. Method AOAC 2005.06 gave results 2-3 times higher than the mouse bioassay method, 959.08, differences thought to be due to underestimation of PSTs by the mouse bioassay. In order to prove the cause of these large differences, work was conducted here to examine the presence and effects of matrix components on the performance of each of the two assays. A range of oyster, cockle and mussel samples were extracted using the AOAC 959.08 hydrochloric acid (HCl) extraction method and analysed for PSP by both MBA and LC-FLD. In addition, extracts were analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for metals as well as being subjected to a range of nutritional testing methods. Whilst there was no evidence for effect of nutritional components on either assay, ICP-MS analysis revealed a relationship between samples exhibiting the largest differences in relative method performance, specifically those with the largest LC-FLD/MBA toxicity ratio, and samples containing the highest concentrations of zinc and manganese. In order to prove the potential effect of the metals on either the LC-FLD and/or MBA assays, HCl extracts of a range of shellfish were subjected to a number of matrix modifications. Firstly, a number of PSP-positive oyster samples were processed to reduce the concentrations of metals within the extracts, without significantly reducing the concentrations of PSTs. Secondly, a range of mussel and cockle extracts, plus a standard solution of saxitoxin di-hydrochloride were spiked at variable concentrations of zinc. All treated and non-treated extracts, plus a number of controls were subjected to ICP-MS, LC-FLD and MBA testing. Results proved the absence of any effect of metals on the performance of the LC-FLD, whilst showing a large suppressive effect of the metals on the MBA.

21995816,"Thirteen laboratories participated in an inter-laboratory study to evaluate the method performance characteristics of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method (LC-MS/MS) for marine lipophilic shellfish toxins. Method performance characteristics were evaluated for mussel (Mytilus edulis), oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and cockle (Cerastoderma edule) matrices. The specific toxin analogues tested included okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxins-1 and -2 (DTX1, -2), azaspiracids-1, -2 and -3 (AZA1, -2, -3), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), yessotoxin (YTX), and 45-OH-yessotoxin (45-OH-YTX). The instrumental technique was developed as an alternative to the still widely applied biological methods (mouse or rat bioassay). Validation was conducted according to the AOAC-harmonised protocol for the design, conduct and interpretation of method-performance studies. Eight different test materials were sent as blind duplicates to the participating laboratories. Twelve laboratories returned results that were accepted to be included in the statistical evaluation. The method precision was expressed as HORRATs. For the individual toxins (except for 45-OH-YTX) HORRATs were found to be ≤1.8 (median HORRAT=0.8) in all tested materials. The recoveries of OA-, AZA- and YTX-group toxins were within the range of 80-108% and PTX2 was within the range of 62-93%. Based on the acceptable values for precision and recovery, it was concluded that the method is suitable for official control purposes to quantitatively determine OA/DTXs, AZAs, YTXs and PTX2 in shellfish.","Food additives & contaminants.

We exposed different sized Asian clams, Corbicula fluminea, to sediment spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations of either zinc, cadmium or a zinc-cadmium mixture for one week. This freshwater bivalve is well suited for sediment toxicity tests as it lives partly buried in the sediment and utilises sediment particles as a food resource. After one week, the whole tissue composition of low molecular weight metabolites was analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The condition index (ratio of tissue dry weight to volume inside the shell valves) was also measured. Small and large clams were clearly differentiated by their metabolic composition and the two size classes showed opposite responses to the mixture spiked sediment. No effects of zinc alone on the metabolome were found and cadmium only influenced the smaller size class. The main perturbations were seen in amino acid and energy metabolism, with small clams using amino acids as an energy resource and larger clams primarily drawing on their larger storage reserves of carbohydrates. Our study demonstrates that metabolomics is a useful technique to test for low level toxicity which does not manifest in mortality or condition index changes. The differing effects between the two size classes stress that it is important to consider age/size when conducting metabolomic and ecotoxicology assessments, since testing for the effects on only one size class makes it more difficult to extrapolate laboratory results to the natural environment.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000367', 'D000818', 'D049628', 'D002104', 'D049874', 'D008401', 'D019015', 'D009682', 'D055442', 'D023382', 'D014874', 'D015032']","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Body Size', 'Cadmium', 'Corbicula', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Metabolome', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Zinc']","Size-dependent effects of low level cadmium and zinc exposure on the metabolome of the Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea.","[None, None, None, 'Q000633', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000633', 'Q000633']","[None, None, None, 'toxicity', 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', None, 'drug effects', None, 'toxicity', 'toxicity']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946168,2012

Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified rAp-S (3085.80Da) showed the addition of a glycine residue on its N-terminal end derived from vector design and peptide purification. The purified rApS fraction was assayed for antifungal activity by direct addition of purified rApS elution to potato dextrose agar media at a final concentration of 81nM. These assays showed important growth inhibitions of both biotrophic (Fusarium oxysporum, Trichoderma harzianum) and necrotrophic (Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria spp.) fungi in that the hyphae structures and spore count were affected in all cases.

The nanometer-sized sulfur particles were synthesized in situ, physically loaded onto alumina microparticles, and the parameters influencing the preconcentration of the analytes, such as the pH, solution flow rate and volume, eluent solution, and interfering ions, were examined. The results showed that the optimal conditions for quantitative recovery of the metal ions by adsorption and elution on the sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) was achieved by employing a flow rate of 15 mL min(-1), a pH of 8.5 for the sample solutions, and an eluent composed of 3.0 mol L(-1) HNO(3) in methanol.

Unfortunately, the interaction between virus and host is largely unknown. According to these, this study was undertaken to deeply explore the immune response of haemocyte against AVNV. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was introduced to produce protein expression profiles from samples taken at 24h post-infection (hpi) from the haemocytes of C. farreri that were either specific pathogen free or else infected with AVNV. Forty-eight protein spots, which consistently showed either a marked change (≥1.5-fold difference) in accumulated levels or else were highly expressed in haemocytes, were selected for further investigation. In-gel trypsin digestion was conducted followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Matching search was subsequently performed throughout bioinformatics databases. A total of 42 proteins were identified, all of which were classified into eight categories according to their Gene Ontology annotations of biological processes and molecular functions, i.e. cytoskeleton proteins, proteins involved in metabolism, proteins related to calcium homeostasis, chaperone, proteins involved in immunity, proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, proteins related to signal transduction, and ungrouped proteins. The possible biological significance of some observed proteins in the host response to AVNV was discussed. These studies could be served as the first global analysis of differentially expressed proteins in haemocytes from AVNV-infected C. farreri, and in addition to increasing our understanding of the pathogenesis of this virus-associated scallop disease, the results presented here should be useful both for potential biomarkers identification and anti-virus approaches development as well.",Developmental and comparative immunology,"['D000818', 'D015870', 'D020869', 'D006434', 'D054884', 'D049897', 'D015398', 'D019032', 'D014780']","['Animals', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hemocytes', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Pectinidae', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Viruses']",Haemocyte protein expression profiling of scallop Chlamys farreri response to acute viral necrosis virus (AVNV) infection.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000276']","[None, None, None, 'enzymology', None, 'enzymology', None, None, 'immunology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21530577,2012

Saccostrea glomerata were exposed in aquaria for four days to three environmentally relevant metals (copper, lead or zinc). Oyster haemolymph proteins from metal-exposed oysters were then compared to haemolymph from non-exposed controls using 2-dimensional electrophoresis to identify proteins that differed significantly in intensity. These proteins were then subjected to tandem mass spectrometry so that putative protein identities could be assigned. The data suggest that there are unique protein expression profiles for each metal. Exposure to 100 μg/l of copper, lead or zinc yielded a total of 25 differentially expressed proteins. However, only one of these protein spots exhibited altered intensities in response to all three metals. Eighteen of the 25 spots were significantly affected by just one of the three metals.

The toxins were quantified against a set of matrix-matched standards instead of standard solutions in methanol. To save valuable standard, methanolic extract instead of the homogenate was spiked with the toxin standard. This was justified by the fact that the extraction efficiency is high for all relevant toxins (above 90%). The method performed very well with respect to accuracy, intraday precision (repeatability), interday precision (within-laboratory reproducibility), linearity, decision limit, specificity and ruggedness. At the permitted level the accuracy ranged from 102 to 111%, the repeatability from 2.6 to 6.7% and the reproducibility from 4.7 to 14.2% in crude methanolic extracts. The crude extracts performed less satisfactorily with respect to the linearity (less than 0.990) and the change in LC-MS/MS sensitivity during the series (more than 25%). SPE purification resulted in greatly improved linearity and signal stability during the series. Recently the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has suggested that to not exceed the acute reference dose the levels should be below 45 microg kg(-1) OA equivalents and 30 microg kg(-1) AZA1 equivalents. A single-day validation was successfully conducted at these levels. If the regulatory levels are lowered towards the EFSA suggested values, the official methods prescribed in legislation (mouse and rat bioassay) will no longer be sensitive enough. The validated LC-MS/MS method presented has the potential to replace these animal tests.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D001681', 'D049872', 'D002138', 'D049873', 'D002853', 'D008387', 'D051379', 'D010125', 'D051381', 'D012758', 'D053719']","['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Bivalvia', 'Calibration', 'Cardiidae', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Marine Toxins', 'Mice', 'Ostreidae', 'Rats', 'Shellfish', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",In-house validation of a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for the analysis of lipophilic marine toxins in shellfish using matrix-matched calibration.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20552174,2010
20486002,"Okadaic acid, a diarrhetic shellfish poison, domoic acid, an amnesic shellfish poison, and saxitoxin, a paralytic shellfish poison, are three of the best-known marine biotoxins. The mouse bioassay is the method most widely used to detect many of these toxins in shellfish samples, but animal welfare concerns have prompted researchers to seek alternative methods of detection. In this study, three direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), each based on antibodies raised in rabbits against a conjugate of the analyte of interest, were developed for marine biotoxin detection in mussel, oyster, and scallop. One assay was for okadaic acid, one for saxitoxin, and one for domoic acid usually detected and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet light (HPLC-UV). All three compounds and a number of related toxins were extracted quickly and simply from the shellfish matrices with a 9 : 1 mixture of ethanol and water before analysis. The detection capabilities (CCbeta values) of the developed ELISAs were 150 microg kg(-1) for okadaic acid, 50 microg kg(-1) for domoic acid, and 5 microg kg(-1) or less for saxitoxin. The assays proved satisfactory when used over a 4-month period for the analysis of 110 real samples collected in Belgium.","Food additives & contaminants.

In the present study, scallops (Patinopecten yessoensis), after acclimation for 1 week in the laboratory, were subjected to acute Cd chloride (CdCl₂) toxicity, and ultramorphological and proteomic changes in their heart tissues were analyzed and compared with those of the nonexposed control group. Electron microscopy showed that ultrastructures of the cytoplasm and mitochondria in scallop hearts were badly damaged, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed 32 protein spots that were differentially expressed after exposure to 10 mg/l CdCl₂ for 24 h. Of these spots, 8 were upregulated, 16 were downregulated, and 8 showed low expression. Proteins from these spots were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and database searching. The results indicated that these proteins are involved in the regulation of cell structure, transport, signal transduction, and metabolism. Among other things, four proteins-identified as amino acid adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase, and ATPase-were demonstrated to be especially associated with Cd toxicity. Some of the other proteins observed in this work are of particular interest in terms of their responses to Cd, which have not been reported previously.

As with other cyclic imine shellfish toxins, pinnatoxins cause rapid death in the mouse bioassay for lipophilic shellfish toxins, but there is no evidence directly linking these compounds to human illness. We have identified the known pinnatoxins A (1) and D (6), and the novel pinnatoxins E (7), F (8) and G (5), in a range of shellfish and environmental samples from Australia and New Zealand using LC-MS. After isolation from the digestive glands of Pacific oysters, the structures of the novel pinnatoxins were determined by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, and their LD(50) values were evaluated by ip administration to mice. Examination of the toxin structures, together with analysis of environmental samples, suggests that pinnatoxins F and G are produced separately in different dinoflagellates. Furthermore, it appears probable that pinnatoxin F (8) is the progenitor of pinnatoxins D (6) and E (7), and that pinnatoxin G (6) is the progenitor of both pinnatoxins A-C (1 and 2) and pteriatoxins A-C (3 and 4), via metabolic and hydrolytic transformations in shellfish.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000470', 'D000818', 'D002851', 'D004141', 'D005399', 'D006863', 'D007928', 'D009682', 'D013058', 'D051379', 'D015394', 'D010125', 'D057096', 'D013141']","['Alkaloids', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dinoflagellida', 'Fishes', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Ostreidae', 'Shellfish Poisoning', 'Spiro Compounds']","Isolation, structural determination and acute toxicity of pinnatoxins E, F and G.","['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20408554,2010

These lipophilic substances, which are generated by an increasing number of sources, are easily transferred to the atmosphere, water, soil, and plants. They are ingested by livestock and become trapped in the fat fraction of edible animal tissues. The aim of this work was to determine the occurrence, risk for human health and entryways of benzenic and halogenated VOCs (BHVOCs) in meat products, milks and sea foods using gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques. In the first part, the occurrence and levels of the BHVOCs in animal products were studied. One muscle and three fat tissues were analysed by GC-Quad/MS in 16 lambs. Of 52 BHVOCs identified, 46 were found in the three fat tissues and 29 in all four tissues, confirming that VOCs are widely disseminated in the body. Twenty-six BHVOCs were quantified in fat tissues, and risk for consumer health was assessed for six of these compounds regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

19774324,"Surface marine sediments from 12 sites within Xiamen Bay (XMB) and marine organisms (clam, crab, and fish) from a heavily polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated site at Yuandang Lagoon were sampled and analyzed for 16 priority PAH content by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The total PAH concentrations in sediments ranged from 203.7 to 1590.5 ng/g, with an average value of 670.0 ng/g. Overall, the total PAH concentrations were relatively lower in the east coastal zone and significantly higher in Yuandang Lagoon. These concentrations were intermediate in comparison with those observed in other estuaries in China. The sources of PAH inputs to sediments in XMB were quantitatively determined by principal components analysis with multiple linear regression. The results showed that, on average, vehicle emissions, petroleum spills, and coal combustion contributed to 41, 36, and 23% of the total PAHs, respectively. Analysis of the PAH composition pattern in marine organisms showed that the total PAHs levels of fishes were lower than those of the clam and crab. The PAH burden of the crab and calm was characterized by the non-negligible occurrence of high-molecular-weight compounds, whereas the fish PAH pattern was dominated by the lower-molecular-weight compounds. In addition, the carcinogenic PAH benzo[a]pyrene was detected in all samples. Molecular indices based on isomeric PAH ratios differentiated the uptake pathway among organisms. The water soluble matter and the petroleum seemed to be the most favorable uptake pathway in fish from Yuandang Lagoon, whereas the crab and clam shared a mix uptake by the water-soluble and the particulate matter.",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D000818', 'D049872', 'D003386', 'D002681', 'D005399', 'D019015', 'D016014', 'D011084', 'D025341', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Bivalvia', 'Brachyura', 'China', 'Fishes', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Linear Models', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contamination of recent sediments and marine organisms from Xiamen Bay, China.","[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19774324,2010

Strong positive correlations were found between the intensity of fishy aftertaste and the concentration of both total iron and ferrous ion. Moreover, the intensity of fishy aftertaste was increased by the addition of ferrous ion in model wine and suppressed by the chelation of ferrous ion in red wine. Third, potent volatile compounds of fishy aftertaste, such as hexanal, heptanal, 1-octen-3-one, (E,Z)-2,4-heptadienal, nonanal, and decanal, were determined by gas chromatography-olfactometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in dried scallop soaked in red wine.

Accumulation of BABs in crab midgut gland tissue was quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the presence of BABs in crab urine was detected spectrophotometrically using ultraviolet fluorescence spectroscopy. Analysis of crab tissues and urine revealed a proportion of the BABs was transferred from the mussel tissues to the crabs, but the majority was not present 3 d after consumption of the mussels and may have been metabolized, excreted, or both. The results do not support the hypothesis that BABs are likely to be biomagnified, at least by crabs, in the marine environment.

The improved sheath-flow interface completely avoids laminar flow in CE capillary caused by the suction from ICP-MS, makes electric supply more stable in CE, and transports analyte solution to ICP-MS easily and more efficiently. CE-ICP-MS coupled with our interface have two quantitative analysis modes: continuous sample-introduction mode and collective sample-introduction mode. The collective sample-introduction technique greatly reduced the dead volume of interface to approximately zero, obviously avoided the excessive dilution of analyte, and eventually led to a much lower detection limit and a much better electrophoretic resolution. This was demonstrated by the better symmetry and narrow peak widths (10-12s) and much lower detection limits (0.030-0.042 microg/L) of four species of arsenic determined with collective sample-introduction mode.

18350880,"During their growth, bivalves are recognized to archive minor and trace elements within their shells which may reflect environmental conditions at the sediment-water interface (SWI). Shells from juvenile Great Scallops (Pecten maximus (L.)), which develop a daily calcite growth layer, were collected in the Bay of Seine (France) and examined by matrix-matched LaserAblation ICP-MS analysis for Mn concentrations along their growth period, from April to October (year 2004). The backdated Mn concentration profiles were compared with environmental variables (e.g., temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, oxygen, etc.) measured continuously at monitoring stations in riverine, estuarine, and coastal waters. The objective was first to perform microanalyses of Mn composition along the shell reflecting episodic enrichment or depletion in such environment, and second, to depict Mn cycling and inputs at the SWI according to the measured profiles. Basically, Mn concentration profiles mostly depend on established estuarine and coastal biogeochemical processes that lead to an increase of dissolved Mn concentration available for shell uptake. Potential particulate Mn fluxes from the Seine River, that control both particulate and dissolved Mn input to the bay, are strongly correlated with shell Mn concentrations from April to July (?r = 0.95, n = 8, p < 0.05). In late summer, riverine inputs can not only provide an explanation for the shell Mn enrichments which suggest additional sources of Mn. During this period, two other processes also contribute to the release of dissolved Mn in coastal waters and the increase of shell Mn content: (1) successive redox oscillations within the high turbidity zone of the macrotidal Seine estuary and (2) postbloom reductive conditions developed at the SWI of the Seine Bay under periodic seasonal eutrophication.

Methylated arsenic, including dimethylarsinic acid, trimethylarsine oxide, tetramethylarsonium ion, arsenobetaine and arsenocholine, with concentrations below 1000microgAsL(-1), may be completely retained in the AG MP-50 cartridge without any changes of arsenite, arsenate and monomethylarsonic acid speciation. Such retention was independent of the pH and matrix. It is proposed to be based on hydrophobic interaction.

Migration kinetics of BADGE and BFDGE from varnish into canned products were evaluated by HPLC in 70 samples after 6, 12 or 18 months of storage. Results showed that there is no migration of BADGE in tuna fish, sardines, mussels or cod. However, migration of BFDGE occurs in all species, in a storage time-dependent way and content of fat, although migration of these compounds is not affected by sterilization conditions. All samples analyzed presented values lower than 9 mg BADGE/kg net product without exceeding European limits. However, concerning BFDGE migration, European legislation does not allow the use and/or the presence of BFDGE.

The highest BFR concentrations were found in pike-perch and eel from the highly industrialized and urbanized rivers Rhine and Meuse. The sum concentrations of BDE 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183, 209, and brominated biphenyl (BB) 153 and HBCD (selection based on The European Food Safety Authority monitoring recommendation) ranged from below quantification limits to 17 ng/g wet weight (ww) in marine fish and in freshwater fish from 0.6 ng/g ww in pike-perch to 380 ng/g ww in eel. The BDE congener profile in all fish and shellfish samples is dominated by BDE 47, followed by BDE 99, except for eel in which BDE 100 is higher than BDE 99. BDE 209 was detected in two mussel samples, most likely due to BDE 209 contaminated particulate matter in their intestines. Total-HBCD (as determined by GC/electron capture negative ion (ECNI)-MS) was detected in 22 out of the 44 samples in concentrations between 0.20 ng/g in marine fish and 230 ng/g ww in eel.

A total of 175 pooled samples of blue mussels from various locations along the Norwegian coastline were analyzed for their content of total arsenic and inorganic arsenic. Total arsenic was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) following microwave-assisted acidic digestion of the samples. Inorganic arsenic was determined using an anion-exchange HPLC-ICPMS method following microwave-assisted alkaline solubilization of the samples. For the majority of the samples (78%) the concentration of total arsenic was below 3 mg kg(-1) wet weight (ww) and inorganic arsenic constituted <9% of the total arsenic (i.e., <0.25 mg kg(-1) ww). However, in some samples higher concentrations of total arsenic were found (up to 13.8 mg kg(-1) ww) and the inorganic arsenic content constituted up to 42% of the total arsenic (up to 5.8 mg kg(-1) ww). These are among the highest inorganic arsenic concentrations reported so far for marine animals. The findings of samples with concentrations of inorganic arsenic above 0.53 mg kg(-1) ww were restricted to sampling sites from two counties, Sogn and Fjordane and Hordaland, whereas samples from the rest of the country showed lower inorganic arsenic concentrations.

18232710,"Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is one of the most severe forms of food poisoning. The toxins responsible for this poisoning are natural compounds, which cause the arrest of action potential propagation by binding to voltage-gated Na+ channels. Several standards for PSP toxins are nowadays commercially available; however, there is not accessible data on the biological activity of the toxins present on this standards and their in vivo toxicity. We have developed an in vitro quantification method for PSP toxins using cultured neurons and compared the potency of the commercial PSP toxin standards in this system with their relative toxicity by mouse bioassay. The in vitro potencies of the PSP toxin standards were saxitoxin (STX) > decarbamoylsaxitoxin (dcSTX) = neosaxitoxin (NeoSTX) > gonyautoxins 1, 4 (GTX1,4) > decarbamoylneosaxitoxin (dcNeoSTX) > gonyautoxins 2, 3 (GTX2,3) > decarbamoylgonyautoxins 2, 3 (dcGTX2,3) > gonyautoxin 5 (GTX5). The data in vitro correlated well with the toxicity values obtained by mouse bioassay. Using this in vitro model we also provide the first data evaluating the potencies of PSP toxins after extraction in acidic pHs, indicating that the toxicity of the sample increases in acidic conditions. This observation correlated well with the chemical transformations undergone by contaminated samples treated in several acidic conditions as corroborated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection of the toxins. Therefore, a variation of 2 units in the pH during PSP extraction may lead to large discrepancies regarding sample lethality during official PSP control in different countries.

18160144,"Five oyster farms in Port Stephens, Australia were studied to identify consequences of using creosote-treated posts and the risks posed by removing the posts. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to measure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and phenols in sediments, timber, water and oyster tissue. Before posts were removed, the total PAHs in surface sediment on farms was 24.1 mgkg(-1) dry weight. This increased to 45.5 mgkg(-1) dry weight after the posts were pulled out and remained significantly higher 6 months later at 59.7 mgkg(-1) dry weight. A similar increase was found in deeper sediments. The sediment attached to creosote-treated posts had a total concentration of PAHs of 484-2642 mgkg(-1) dry weight, while the corresponding value for the sediment on tar-treated posts was only 30.7 mgkg(-1) dry weight. The surface timber of creosote-treated posts had high levels of PAHs and an average post contained 43 g of PAHs. The total PAHs dispersed to the environment when a creosote-treated post was pulled out was at least 0.67 g. The main species were PAHs with low-molecular weights: fluoranthene, phenanthrene, pyrene, acenaphthylene and chrysene. Benzo(a)pyrene represented 1-10% of PAHs in most samples. Bioassays with creosote-contaminated sediment revealed that Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerate) and Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) accumulated PAHs at (mgkg(-1) wet tissue weight): 11.3-15.3 and 35.5-47.9, respectively, when exposed for 5 days to water with < 1 microgl(-1) PAHs. Wild oysters growing on creosote-treated posts had high levels of phenols (0.09-6.92 mgkg(-1) wet weight) and PAHs (0.59-1.01 mgkg(-1) wet weight).

To reduce the burden on the environment, effective utilization and disposal methods of the wastes are required. Therefore, we have screened for useful materials in scallop internal organs, and found ultraviolet (UV) absorbing compounds from scallop ovaries. Based on UV absorption, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), ESI-MS/MS, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, three UV absorbing compounds were identified as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs): shinorine, porphyra-334 (P-334), and mycosporine-glycine. To investigate whether MAAs can act as a UV protector for human cells, we examined the protective effects of the three MAAs on human fibroblast cells from UV irradiation. All of the three examined MAAs protected the cells from UV-induced cell death. In particular, mycosporine-glycine had the strongest effect. Further, we found a promotion effect of MAAs on the proliferation of human skin fibroblast cells.

Oysters were harvested in various areas of France, and models of discrimination according to harvest season were built from Py-MS fingerprints and from virtual SPME-MS fingerprints obtained by summing the mass spectra generated by the SPME-GC-MS system. The treatment of the Py-MS data by a 21-12-3 artificial neural networks led to a correct classification of only 89.2% of the oyster samples according to shoreline. The misclassifications thus did not allow use of the Py-MS technique as a relevant tool for authentication of oyster origin. The assessment of the potential of the virtual SPME-MS fingerprints to discriminate the production area of oysters was undertaken on a part of the sample set. The virtual SPME-MS data were pretreated according to two methods, filtering of raw data (FRD) and comprehensive combinatory standard correction (CCSC), a recently developed chemometric method used for the correction of instrumental signal drifts in MS systems. The results obtained with the virtual SPME-MS fingerprints are promising because this technique, when the data were pretreated by the CCSC method, led to a successful discrimination of the oyster samples not only according to shoreline but also according to production region.

18054324,"Akazara scallop (Chlamys nipponensis akazara) troponin C (TnC) of striated adductor muscle binds only one Ca(2+) ion at the C-terminal EF-hand motif (Site IV), but it works as the Ca(2+)-dependent regulator in adductor muscle contraction. In addition, the scallop troponin (Tn) has been thought to regulate muscle contraction via activating mechanisms that involve the region spanning from the TnC C-lobe (C-lobe) binding site to the inhibitory region of the TnI, and no alternative binding of the TnI C-terminal region to TnC because of no similarity between second TnC-binding regions of vertebrate and the scallop TnIs. To clarify the Ca(2+)-regulatory mechanism of muscle contraction by scallop Tn, we have analyzed the Ca(2+)-binding properties of the complex of TnC C-lobe and TnI peptide, and their interaction using isothermal titration microcalorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, and gel filtration chromatography. The results showed that single Ca(2+)-binding to the Site IV leads to a structural transition not only in Site IV but also Site III through the structural network in the C-lobe of scallop TnC.

17973069,"Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), we screened the insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of 40 individuals from a natural population of Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri). Surprisingly, only 7.5% of individuals were homogeneous in ITS constitution, while the others (92.5%) were heterozygous. Based on different peak types in DHPLC analysis, seven individuals were randomly chosen to investigate indel polymorphism in the ITS sequences within individuals. Furthermore, indel polymorphism in the ITS sequences of single sperms was also investigated in more individuals belonging to different peak types. Based on these results, we concluded that rapid intrachromosomal recombination drove homogenization of rDNA arrays and interchromosomal recombination might contribute to form new variants, and that it may be less rare than previously thought although it was much less frequent than intrachromosomal recombination in the homogenization process. Further, we proposed an expanded model for concerted evolution of the rDNA family in a natural population of C. farreri. A pathway in the new model which homogenizes a variant unit, beginning with two-peak type individuals and ends with two-peak type individuals, is a larruping pathway in the natural population of C. farreri. As the highest proportion in natural populations, two-peak individuals with equal peak areas can be viewed as being in a steady and balanced state which is maintained by rapid intrachromosomal recombination.",Journal of molecular evolution,"['D000818', 'D001483', 'D002851', 'D004275', 'D021903', 'D019143', 'D008957', 'D008969', 'D049897', 'D011995', 'D017422', 'D012689']","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA, Ribosomal', 'DNA, Ribosomal Spacer', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pectinidae', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']","Patterns of concerted evolution of the rDNA family in a natural population of Zhikong scallop, Chlamys farreri.","[None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None]","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17973069,2008
17760339,"A collaborative study was conducted on the Biosense amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the determination of domoic acid (DA) toxins in shellfish in order to obtain interlaboratory validation data for the method. In addition, a method comparison study was performed to evaluate the ASP ELISA as an alternative to the current liquid chromatography (LC) reference method for DA determination. The study material comprised 16 shellfish samples, including blue mussels, Pacific oysters, and king scallops, spiked with contaminated mussel homogenates to contain 0.1-20 mg DA/kg shellfish flesh. The shellfish samples were extracted with 50% aqueous methanol, and the supernatants were directly analyzed. Sixteen participating laboratories in 10 countries reported data from the ASP ELISA, and 4 of these laboratories also reported data from instrumental LC analysis. The participating laboratories achieved interlaboratory precision estimates for the 8 Youden paired shellfish samples in the range of 10-20% for RSD(r) (mean 14.8 +/- 4%), and 13-29% for RSDR (mean 22.7 +/- 6%). The precision estimates for the ELISA data did not show a strong dependence on the DA concentration in the study samples, and the overall precision achieved was within the acceptable range of the Horwitz guideline with HorRat values ranging from 1.1 to 2.4 (mean HorRat 1.7 +/- 0.5). The analysis of shellfish samples spiked with certified reference material (CRM)-ASP-MUS-b gave recoveries in the range of 88-122%, with an average recovery of 104 +/- 10%. The estimate on method accuracy was supported by a correlation slope of 1.015 (R2 = 0.992) for the determined versus the expected DA values. Furthermore, the correlation of the ASP ELISA results with those for the instrumental LC analyses of the same sample extracts gave a correlation slope of 1.29 (R2 = 0.984). This indicates some overestimation of DA levels in shellfish by the ELISA, but it is also a result of apparent low recoveries for the LC methods.

17571682,"Subcellular metal distribution may play an important role in the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of metals in marine food chains. In the present study, we preexposed the green mussel Perna viridis to Ag and Cd and quantified their trophic transfer efficiencies to two predators (whelks [Thais clavigera] and fish [Terapon jarbua]). For the mussels, more Ag was distributed in the metal-rich granule (MRG) fraction following Ag exposure, and more Cd was distributed in the metallothionein-like protein following Cd exposure. In addition, Cd was mainly bound with the proteins having a molecular size of approximately 20 kDa. After being fed with metal-exposed mussels, the assimilation efficiencies of Ag decreased significantly (from 77 to 29-60% in whelks and from 9 to 2% in fish) with an increasing percentage of Ag deposited in the MRG fraction of the prey. In contrast, the assimilation efficiencies of Cd remained comparable (81-85% in whelks and 6-8% in fish), because its partitioning in the soluble fraction of different treatments of the prey was similar. The efflux of Ag and Cd in the two predators was comparable after feeding on preexposed mussel prey. Our results imply that the subcellular distribution of metals in prey may affect the dietary assimilation of metals in predators, but such influence is clearly metal-specific.

17521156,"The potential risk through ingestion of microcystins (MC) in contaminated mollusks has not been well studied. The present paper studied seasonal changes of MC content (determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) in various organs of three species of bivalves (Cristaria plicata, Hyriopsis cumingii, and Lamprotula leai) in Lake Taihu, China, where toxic cyanobacterial blooms occurred. Coinciding with peaks of seston MC (maximum, 5.7 microg/L) and MC in cyanobacterial blooms (maximum, 0.534 mg/g), most organs showed sharp MC peaks during the summer, indicating both fast uptake and fast depuration by bivalves. Because hepatopancreas and intestine had considerably higher MC content than other organs, they are the most dangerous for human consumption. Both the present and previous studies show that the hepatopancreatic MC and total tissue MC often are correlated in various aquatic invertebrates. During the peak of the cyanobacterial blooms, C. plicata had higher hepatopancreatic MC content than the other bivalves, whereas H. cumingii had higher intestinal MC content than the other bivalves. Estimated daily intakes for humans from the consumption of whole tissues of the three bivalves were 0.48 to 0.94 microg MC-LR equivalent/kg body weight (12- to 23.5-fold the tolerable daily intake value proposed by the World Health Organization), which indicates a high risk for humans consuming these bivalves.",Environmental toxicology and chemistry,"['D000818', 'D049872', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004784', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D043143', 'D006801', 'D007413', 'D013058', 'D052998', 'D018570', 'D012621', 'D014018', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Bivalvia', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Hepatopancreas', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microcystins', 'Risk Assessment', 'Seasons', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']","Microcystin accumulation in freshwater bivalves from Lake Taihu, China, and the potential risk to human consumption.","[None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17521156,2007
17481413,"Accurate determination of Se in biological samples, especially fish and shellfish, by hydride generation techniques has generally proven troublesome owing to the presence of organoselenium that cannot readily converted into inorganic selenium under usual oxidising conditions. Further improvements in the oxidation procedures are needed so as to obtain accurate concentration values when this type of samples is analyzed. Microwave-assisted wet digestion (MAWD) procedures of seafood based on HNO3 or the mixture HNO3/H2O2 and further thermal reduction of the Se(VI) formed to Se(IV) were evaluated. These procedures were as follows: (I) without H2O2 and without heating to dryness; (II) without H2O2 and with heating to dryness; (III) with H2O2 and without heating to dryness; (IV) with H2O2 and with heating to dryness. In general, low recoveries of selenium are obtained for several marine species (e.g., crustaceans and cephalopods), which may be ascribed to the presence of Se forms mainly associated with nonpolar proteins and lipids. Post-digestion UV irradiation proved very efficient since not only complete organoselenium decomposition was achieved but also the final step required for prereduction of Se(VI) into Se(IV) (i.e. heating at 90 degrees C for 30 min in 6M HCl) could be avoided. With the MAWD/UV procedure, the use of strong oxidising agents (persuphate, etc.) or acids (e.g. perchloric acid) which are typically applied prior to Se determination by hydride generation techniques is overcome, and as a result, sample pre-treatment is significantly simplified. The method was successfully validated against CRM DOLT-2 (dogfish liver), CRM DORM-2 (dogfish muscle) and CRM TORT-2 (lobster hepatopancreas). Automated ultrasonic slurry sampling with electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry was also applied for comparison. Total Se contents in ten seafood samples were established.

The Gulf is still a significant source of fish, crabs and shellfish for human consumption to both countries, where concerns over the quality of this marine environment have been long expressed but never properly addressed. In addition, the circulatory current patterns in the Gulf ensure that contaminants originating from either country are likely to affect both countries eventually. Heavy metals were determined in oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae and C. virginica), green mussels (Perna viridis) and sediments from the Gulf of Paria. Samples were obtained at four sites in Trinidad and three sites in Venezuela in the Gulf of Paria, in addition to comparative samples collected from three sites on the north coast of Venezuela. Edible tissues of twelve shellfish from each location were blended and aliquots digested with concentrated nitric acid, for extraction of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc. The solutions were analysed by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Mercury was extracted with a mixture of nitric, hydrochloric and sulphuric acids and determined by cold vapour atomic absorption. Sediments were oven-dried at 60'C, before being similarly extracted. Results showed that mercury in sediments at all sites in Trinidad and Venezuela exceeded NOAA and Canadian sediment quality guidelines, while cadmium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc also exceeded these guidelines at several sites. Heavy metal levels in oysters and green mussels varied widely with location. However, oysters from the Gulf of Paria contained significantly higher mean levels of cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc than those from the north coast of Venezuela, but this difference was not apparent in mussels. Cadmium, mercury and zinc in sediments were significantly correlated with those of mussels, but not of oysters, in which copper and zinc at several sites in the Gulf of Paria exceeded local maximum permissible levels (Cu = 20 microg g(-1) wet wt; Zn = 50 microg g(-1) wet wt) for human consumption. These findings indicate that while mussels may be better biological indicators of heavy metal pollution in sediments than oysters, the latter may provide copper and zinc contamination.

The pattern of bioaccumulation was different for the isomers in Lake Winnipeg. The anti-isomer was dominant in higher trophic level (TL) organisms like walleye [arithmetic mean +/- 1 x standard error: 730 +/- 120 pg/g, lipid weight (1w)] and goldeye (760 +/- 170 pg/g, Iw) while the syn-isomer dominated the lower TL organisms like zooplankton (550 +/- 40 pg/g, Iw) and mussels (430 +/- 140 pg/g, Iw). In Lake Ontario, the extent of bioaccumulation of the isomers and concentrations was greatest in the lower TL benthic organism, Diporeia (syn, 1307 +/- 554; and anti, 3108 +/- 898 pg/g Iw) and also high in zooplankton (syn, 719; and anti, 1332 pg/g Iw).

17383668,"A simple, fast, and accurate method for the simultaneous determination of methylmercury (MeHg(+)), monobutyltin (MBT), dibutyltin (DBT) and tributyltin (TBT) in seafood is proposed. The method makes use of relatively cheap instrumentation and allows simultaneous analysis of those four species in a routine basis. The sample is treated with methanolic potassium hydroxide in an ultrasound bath, derivatised with sodium tetraethylborate (NaBEt(4)), preconcentrated into n-hexane and analysed by gas chromatography with atomic emission detection (GC-MIP/AES). The soft extraction conditions provided by ultrasound energy prevent chemical decomposition of the analytes and allow fast and efficient recovery of the species considered. Both the extraction and the derivatisation/preconcentration steps were optimised. Detection limits of 34, 3, 6 and 8 ng g(-1) (dry mass) were obtained for MeHg(+), MBT, DBT and TBT, respectively, using the best experimental conditions found. The uncertainty of the analysis ranged from 11% (MeHg(+)) to 15% (MBT). The accuracy of the method was checked by the analysis of several certified reference materials, e.g., BCR 477 (mussel tissue, MBT, DBT and TBT), DOLT-2 (dogfish liver, MeHg(+)), BCR 463 (tuna fish, MeHg(+)) and NIST 2976 (mussel tissue, MeHg(+)) with satisfactory results. Several oyster samples collected in the estuary of the Oka River (Urdaibai, Unesco Reserve of the Biosphere, Basque Country) during four sampling campaigns in 2003-2004 were processed following the proposed procedure.

Because of the geographic distance between the Mediterranean Sea in Europe (origin of the fish) and Australia (origin of the sponge), a closely related sponge, Scalarispongia scalaris, was collected in the Mediterranean Sea and analyzed for PBHDs and other halogenated compounds. The Mediterranean sponge contained the PBHDs at 37 mg/kg dry weight. Using quantitative standards for the first time, the PBHD concentrations in fish and mussel samples published earlier were re-examined. Concentrations of up to 1 mg/kg TriBHD and 0.5 mg/kg TetraBHD were determined in the lipids. No correlation with 2,2', 4,4', 5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153) or p,p'-DDE was found, which is in agreement with other marine halogenated natural products detected in the fish samples. Besides the PBHDs, further unknown halogenated compounds were detected in the Mediterranean sponge, some of which were also detected in commercial fish. GC/electron ionization-MS analysis showed that a major mixed-halogenated compound in the sponge had a molecular ion at m/z 480 and contained three bromines, three chlorines, and 9-10 carbons. No corresponding structure has been described for this feature in the scientific literature. This sponge secondary metabolite and potential novel halogenated natural product was also detected in commercial fish.

17245391,"Indigenous people of the Torres Strait Islands have been concerned about the safety of their traditional seafoods since the discovery of high cadmium levels in the liver and kidney of dugong and turtle in 1996. This study explored links between urinary cadmium levels and consumption frequency of these traditional foods and piloted a community-based methodology to identify potential determinants of cadmium exposure and accumulation. Consultations led to selection of one community for study from which 60 women aged 30 to 50 years participated in health and food frequency survey, urine collection and a routine health check. Urinary cadmium levels were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry; data were analysed using SPSS-14. The geometric mean cadmium level in this group of women was 1.17 (arithmetic mean 1.86) microg/g creatinine with one-third exceeding 2.0 microg/g creatinine. Heavy smoking (>or=300 pack years) was linked to higher cadmium in urine, as was increasing age and waist circumference. Analysis of age-adjusted residuals revealed significant associations (P<0.05) between cadmium level and higher consumption of turtle liver and kidney, locally gathered clams, peanuts, coconut, chocolate and potato chips. Dugong kidney consumption approached significance (P=0.06). Multiple regression revealed that 40% (adjusted r(2)) of variation in cadmium level was explained by the sum of these associated foods plus heavy smoking, age and waist circumference. No relationships between cadmium and pregnancy history were found.

17171303,"The use of various organophosphates to control mosquito populations is a common practice across the globe. We review the literature (LC50s) on dichlorvos, the primary breakdown product of Dibrom, and use laboratory and field experiments to determine the lethal and sublethal (bioassays) effects of dichlorvos on two widely distributed and ecologically important estuarine invertebrate species, the marsh grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio and the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Laboratory results based on LC50s and sublethal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition activity bioassays indicate that adult grass shrimp are more sensitive (approximately 500 x ) to dichlorvos than juvenile oysters. Although potentially an important factor for intertidal or shallow-dwelling estuarine organisms, the toxicity of dichlorvos was not enhanced in the presence of simulated sunlight for adult P. pugio. The most notable decreases in AChE activity were for grass shrimp and oysters exposed to dichlorvos concentrations above those considered ecologically relevant. In field experiments, both species were deployed in cages in unsprayed (n = 2) and sprayed (n = 3) sites and water samples collected pre- and post-spraying. Quantifiable dichlorvos levels were measured at the two narrowest creek treatment sites following mosquito spraying, suggesting that overspray can occur and there was evidence of a sublethal AChE response at these same sites. However, experiments at the widest creek revealed no measurable dichlorvos or sublethal responses. Results from this research suggest that adult grass shrimp are more sensitive to dichlorvos than juvenile oysters. Spraying near small tidal creeks may have measurable impacts on resident species, while larger (wider) creeks appear to be capable of buffering organisms from transient fluxes of mosquito control agents that may enter the system.",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D000367', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D002800', 'D004006', 'D004785', 'D008401', 'D007928', 'D009032', 'D010125', 'D033541', 'D045483', 'D013022', 'D013045', 'D023382']","['Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Dichlorvos', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Mosquito Control', 'Ostreidae', 'Palaemonidae', 'Rivers', 'South Carolina', 'Species Specificity', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute']",Acute toxicity and acetylcholinesterase inhibition in grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica) exposed to the organophosphate dichlorvos: laboratory and field studies.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17171303,2007

The results demonstrate that transfer and transformation of PSP toxins occurred when Panulirus stimpsoni were fed with toxic viscera of Chlamys nobilis, but depurated with non-toxic squids. Additionally, only the lobster hepatopancreas were found to contain PSP, and the toxin profiles were the same with those in the viscera of the scallop, including carbamate toxins (GTX(1-3)), N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins (C(1+2) and B(1)) and decarbamoyl toxins (dcGTX(2+3)). Unlike the lobster, the scallop contained more alpha than beta toxins. After being fed with toxic Chlamys nobili for 6 d, Panulirus stimpsoni selectively accumulated N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins with low toxicity. However, when they were depurated with non-toxic squid, N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins tended to transform into carbamate toxins with higher toxicity. The concentration of dcGTX(2+3) in Panulirus stimpsoni decreased significantly and wasn't detectable after depuration for 6 d, which was likely due to their initial low accumulation of toxins.

Plasmalogen (Pls) and diacyl + alkyl (Ptd) forms of serine, ethanolamine, and choline glycerophospholipids were isolated by HPLC and their FA compositions analyzed by GC-FID. PIs and Ptd forms of serine glycerophospholipids (PlsSer and PtdSer), and to a lesser extend the Pls form of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids (PlsEtn), were found to be specifically enriched with c4,7,10,t13-22:4. This specificity was found to decrease in the tested organs in the following order: gills, mantle, gonad, and muscle. In gills, c4,7,10,t13-22:4 was shown to be the main unsaturated FA of serine glycerophospholipids in both Pls and Ptd forms (23.8 and 19.4 mol%, respectively, for A. opercularis, and 21.0 and 26.2 mol% for P. maximus). These results represent the first comprehensive report on the FA composition of plasmalogen serine subclass isolated from pectinid bivalves. The specific association of the PlsSer with the c4,7,10,t13-22:4 for the two pectinid species can be paralleled to the specific association of the PlsSer with the non-methylene interrupted (NMI) FA and 20:1 (n-11) observed in mussels, clams, and oysters (Kraffe, E., Soudant, P., and Marty, Y.

These compounds are the sulfur analogues of oxo-arsenicals, a large group of naturally-occurring compounds, whereby the arsinoyl (As=O) group is substituted by an arsinothioyl group (As=S). The most common separation technique for oxo-arsenicals is anion-exchange HPLC with polymer-based columns, but under these conditions the thio-arsenicals show strong retention, resulting in unacceptably long analysis times and broad peaks. We report the development of a reversed-phase HPLC method, with ICPMS detection, which allows separation of the known thio-arsenicals within 15 min with significantly improved peak shapes. The detection limit is about 0.6 microg As/L based on 10 microL injection volume.

In this sense, once the samples were extracted--essentially with acetone and in a microwave system--and before they could be analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), three different approaches were studied for the clean-up step: solid phase extraction (SPE), microwave-assisted saponification (MAS) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The main aim of this work was to maximise the recoveries of PAHs and to minimise the presence of interfering compounds in the last extract. In the case of SPE, Florisil cartridges of 1, 2 and 5 g, and silica cartridges of 5 g were studied. In that case, and with oysters and mussels, microwave-assisted extraction and 5 g Florisil cartridges provided good results. In addition, the concentrations obtained for Standard Reference Material (SRM) NIST 2977 (mussel tissue) were in good agreement with the certified values. In the case of microwave-assisted saponification, the extracts were not as clean as those obtained with 5 g Florisil and this fact lead to overestimate the concentration of the heaviest PAHs.

16824623,"Relationships between Cd accumulation and subcellular distribution, and growth and mortality rates were examined in the freshwater bivalve Pyganodon grandis in a transplant experiment. Organisms were transferred from a clean lacustrine site to four lakes situated along a Cd concentration gradient in the mining region of Rouyn-Noranda. The bivalves were maintained in open enclosures placed in the bottom sediments of the littoral zone of all five lakes for 400 days. At the end of the experiment, metallothionein (MT) was measured in the bivalve gills with a Hg-saturation assay and Cd partitioning among the various cytosolic protein pools was determined by size-exclusion chromatography. Marked differences were observed among the five sites: the range in calculated free-cadmium ion concentrations in water overlying the sediments was 35-fold whereas Cd concentrations in the gill cytosol of the transplanted bivalves varied three-fold. In the transplanted bivalves, the distribution of gill Cd among the various cytosolic complexes also varied significantly among sites. For bivalves transplanted to the three most contaminated sites, Cd concentrations in the high molecular weight pool (HMW>25 kDa) were significantly higher than the baseline levels determined from bivalves caged at the reference site; a similar trend was seen for Cd concentrations in the metallothionein pool (Cd-MT). For bivalves transferred to two of the high contamination sites, proportionately less of the gill cytosolic Cd was sequestered (i.e. detoxified) by MT-like proteins. Reductions in survival were also observed at these two sites, and these elevated mortalities, in turn, were consistent with the absence of indigenous bivalve populations at these sites. This result is compatible with our recent work on P. grandis populations living in lakes of the Rouyn-Noranda area, in which we demonstrated that excessive accumulation of Cd in the HMW pool of the gill cytosol of the individual mollusks could be related to the impairment of population health status.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000818', 'D002104', 'D002850', 'D003600', 'D004781', 'D005618', 'D019015', 'D005880', 'D008668', 'D011156', 'D011897', 'D013347', 'D016019', 'D049876', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Cadmium', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cytosol', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Fresh Water', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Gills', 'Metallothionein', 'Population Density', 'Random Allocation', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Survival Analysis', 'Unionidae', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Linking changes in subcellular cadmium distribution to growth and mortality rates in transplanted freshwater bivalves (Pyganodon grandis).,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'drug effects', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16824623,2007

The molecular formula was established to be C16H19Br3O by gas chromatography with electron ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/EI-HRMS). GC/EI-MS data were virtually identical with a polybrominated hexahydroxanthene derivative (PBHD) previously isolated from an Australian sponge species known to occur in the Mediterranean Sea as well. A tetrabromo isomer (TetraBHD) was also found in the fish samples. The concentrations of TriBHD and other halogenated compounds in commercial fish (sea bass, gilt head bream, anchovy, sardine, and salmon) were estimated with GC/electron capture detection (ECD). Using the ECD response of trans-nonachlor, the concentration of TriBHD reached up to 90 ng/g lipid weight and accounted for up to >90% of the concentration of p,p'-DDE, which was the most abundant peak in the most samples investigated. On the basis of the GC/ECD response, TetraBHD amounted for approximately 1/7 of TriBHD in all fish samples investigated. The sample with the highest content was a green-lipped mussel from New Zealand (236 ng/g lipid weight). The halogenated natural products TBA, Q1, and MHC-1 were also present in most of the samples. We assume that the bulk of the residues in fish from aquaculture may originate from algae and sponges living in proximity of the fish farms.

Oysters were extracted with fresh methanol-water (8+2), and this was replicated three times. They were then evaporated to near dryness and subsequently redissolved in pure water; defatting was then performed with a C18 cartridge. The trace hydride active arsenic species, that is, iAs, MA, and DMA, in the defatted solutions were determined with a sensitive hydride generation-packed coldfinger trap-atomic absorption spectrometric (HG-PCFT-AAS) coupled system. The arsenicals that were desorbed from the cation-exchange resin (Dowex 50W-X8) in the washings of 4 M NH3 were categorized on the basis of AB + DMA.

16341340,"The objective of this study was to identify the receptor of OJ367, an oyster juice-borne bacteriophage, in Salmonella derby ATCC 6960. The crude receptor outer membrane (OM) fraction was prepared and examined from the total cell envelope (TCE) by differential extraction with N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-MgCl2 and then with Triton-HEPES-ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid buffers. The OM proteins (Omps) were isolated by diethylaminoethyl column chromatography to screen for receptor activity. A 45-kDa protein belonging to a minor Omp species, with phage neutralization ability, was eluted in a homogeneous form. It was a non-peptidoglycan-associated protein which was digestible by trypsin. Lipopolysaccharide had no influence on its receptor activity when coexistent in the diethylaminoethyl column fractions. An S. derby mutant resistant to lysis by phage OJ367 was isolated. The mutant not only showed decreased receptor activity in vitro when its TCE was tested but had an altered Omp profile. This implied that the 45-kDa Omp is involved as a receptor in coliphage binding; however, this role is affected by the expression of other Omps.","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi","['D000818', 'D001425', 'D002462', 'D003090', 'D004591', 'D005516', 'D009154', 'D010125', 'D011991', 'D012475', 'D012483']","['Animals', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins', 'Cell Membrane', 'Coliphages', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Food Microbiology', 'Mutation', 'Ostreidae', 'Receptors, Virus', 'Salmonella', 'Salmonella Phages']",The receptor of an oyster juice-borne coliphage OJ367 in the outer membrane of Salmonella derby.,"[None, 'Q000302', 'Q000821', 'Q000302', None, None, None, 'Q000382', 'Q000302', 'Q000235', 'Q000302']","[None, 'isolation & purification', 'virology', 'isolation & purification', None, None, None, 'microbiology', 'isolation & purification', 'genetics', 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16341340,2006

16192070,"Monitoring programmes for paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins in bivalve molluscs still rely heavily on the use of mouse bioassays (MBA) for consumer protection. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methodology (Lawrence method) was implemented in 1996 in the Portuguese monitoring programme as a complementary means of analysis. Comparison between MBA and HPLC was done at the time only by a qualitative approach due to the scarce number of positive samples tested. More quantitative data were obtained recently when studying toxin profiles in Moroccan shellfish, and the correlation found between these two methodologies is reported here for the first time. Two different matrices were studied: blue mussel and the giant cockle Acanthocardia tuberculatum. A good linear correlation was obtained for both matrices. However, a second-degree polynomial best fitted the data at both low and high extremes of toxicity. According to the HPLC quantitative results, 13% of false-negatives could be obtained by MBA due to an underestimation of toxicity near the limit of detection of the MBA. Difficulties on relying solely on HPLC for consumer protection have been aroused with uncommon matrices, such as imported clams or crustaceans, due to the presence of high concentrations of interfering compounds. The solid-phase extraction step of the Lawrence method was implemented to eliminate an unknown compound that could be mistaken for saxitoxin, and an 80% reduction of another common unknown compound eluting close to decarbamoylsaxitoxin. The implementation of the HPLC methodology achieved so far allows a high degree of consumer protection without the need to resource to animal sacrifice.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000818', 'D001681', 'D049873', 'D002851', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D008387', 'D051379', 'D049880', 'D015203', 'D012530', 'D012758']","['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiidae', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Marine Toxins', 'Mice', 'Mytilus edulis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Saxitoxin', 'Shellfish']",Assessment of the quantitative determination of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins by pre-column derivatization and elimination of interfering compounds by solid-phase extraction.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000378', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000031', 'Q000032']","[None, 'methods', 'metabolism', 'methods', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16192070,2006
16136305,"An accurate and sensitive multi-species species-specific isotope dilution GC-ICP-MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of trimethyllead (Me3Pb+), monomethylmercury (MeHg+) and the three butyltin species Bu3Sn+, Bu2Sn2+, and BuSn3+ in biological samples. The method was validated by three biological reference materials (CRM 477, mussel tissue certified for butyltins; CRM 463, tuna fish certified for MeHg+; DORM 2, dogfish muscle certified for MeHg+). Under certain conditions, and with minor modifications of the sample pretreatment procedure, this method could also be transferred to environmental samples such as sediments, as demonstrated by analyzing sediment reference material BCR 646 (freshwater sediment, certified for butyltins). The detection limits of the multi-species GC-ICP-IDMS method for biological samples were 1.4 ng g(-1) for MeHg+, 0.06 ng g(-1) for Me3Pb+, 0.3 ng g(-1) for BuSn3+ and Bu3Sn+, and 1.2 ng g(-1) for Bu2Sn2+. Because of the high relevance of these heavy metal alkyl species to the quality assurance of seafood, the method was also applied to corresponding samples purchased from a supermarket. The methylated lead fraction in these samples, correlated to total lead, varied over a broad range (from 0.01% to 7.6%). On the other hand, the MeHg+ fraction was much higher, normally in the range of 80-100%. Considering that we may expect tighter legislative limitations on MeHg+ levels in seafood in the future, we found the highest methylmercury contents (up to 10.6 microg g(-1)) in two shark samples, an animal which is at the end of the marine food chain, whereas MeHg+ contents of less than 0.2 microg g(-1) were found in most other seafood samples; these results correlate with the idea that MeHg+ is usually of biological origin in the marine environment. The concentration of butyltins and the fraction of the total tin content that is from butyltins strongly depend on possible contamination, due to the exclusively anthropogenic character of these compounds. A broad variation in the butylated tin fraction (in the range of <0.3-49%) was therefore observed in different seafood samples. Corresponding isotope-labeled spike compounds (except for trimethyllead) are commercially available for all of these compounds, and since these can be used in the multi-species species-specific GC-ICP-IDMS method developed here, this technique shows great potential for routine analysis in the future.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D049872', 'D002849', 'D005399', 'D008401', 'D008767', 'D011865', 'D012680', 'D013045', 'D013756', 'D014018', 'D014220']","['Animals', 'Bivalvia', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Fishes', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Radioisotope Dilution Technique', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Species Specificity', 'Tetraethyl Lead', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Trialkyltin Compounds']","Simultaneous multi-species determination of trimethyllead, monomethylmercury and three butyltin compounds by species-specific isotope dilution GC-ICP-MS in biological samples.","[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000097', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000031', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'blood', 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16136305,2006

16131065,"The large number of arsenic species known to be present in marine samples and their broad range of chemical properties pose a significant challenge for arsenic speciation analysis. The predominantly used ICPMS detection online with HPLC only provides element-selective information, which is not sufficient for the identification of arsenic species without standards. However, electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode enables molecule-selective detection with high sensitivity for quantification. A new HPLC-ES-SRM method was developed for the determination of more than 20 organoarsenic species. Two chromatographic systems were compared, an anion exchange method and a combined cation anion exchange method. Collision-induced dissociation breakdown curves were constructed for all arsenic species investigated and used to optimize the SRM conditions. External calibration was performed with mixed standard solutions containing 21 arsenic species. Two SRM transitions were monitored for most of the analytes, and their intensity ratio was used for quality control. The developed methods were applied for the quantification of arsenic species in extracts of four marine reference materials. Spiking experiments revealed, especially for the early-eluting analytes on the anion exchange system, significant signal suppression by coeluting matrix constituents. Therefore, the standard addition approach was used for quantification.

Sediment burdens for all compounds, even for an apparent hot spot near a refinery in Bahrain, were amongst the lowest reported for surface sediments from other seas. Concentrations of DDTs were low in the muscle and liver of all fish (orange spotted grouper and the spangled emperor) analysed. Similarly, the levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons were low in the various bivalve species, notably rock oysters and pearl oysters. These results contribute to the sparse regional database for organochlorinated compounds in the marine environment. Moreover, they can be used as the most recent end point for elucidating temporal trends.

During the test, we varied the quantity of dietary U (from beforehand contaminated bivalves at concentrations ranging from 0.9+/-0.1 to 20.2+/-9 microg/g fw provided to each crayfish over the 10 days) applying a daily feeding rate equal to 3.9+/-0.8% fw. The efficiency of U trophic transfer from clams to crayfish varied between 1 and 13% depending on the prey exposure modalities. Accumulation of U was observed in the digestive gland but also in gills, in the muscle, and in the molt of the crayfish after trophic exposure treatments. Under high-level exposure conditions, the digestive gland was the main target-organ, however a significant accumulation was also observed in the stomach. With regard to low levels of trophic exposure, accumulation of U in gills, in the stomach, and in the digestive gland was of the same order of magnitude.

Especial attention has been paid to antioxidant defences and oxidative damage to biomolecules. Deep differences in the response of oysters and mussels to metal pollution were found. Oysters, with the higher metal loads of both species, showed increased antioxidant defences, and less extensive oxidative damage. In contrast, mussels, which accumulated much lower metal concentrations, showed clear increases in oxidized biomolecules, in agreement with their low increases in the antioxidant defence mechanisms. Our results suggest that mussels are more sensitive and less well adapted to metal pollution, probably explaining their absence in the most contaminated studied site, Mazagón.

16001850,"A method that uses liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) has been developed for the highly sensitive and specific determination of amnesic shellfish poisoning toxins, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins, and other lipophilic algal toxins and metabolites in shellfish. The method was subjected to a full single-laboratory validation and a limited interlaboratory study. Tissue homogenates are blended with methanol-water (9 + 1), and the centrifuged extract is cleaned up with a hexane wash. LC/MS/MS (triple quadrupole) is used for quantitative analysis with reversed-phase gradient elution (acidic buffer), electrospray ionization (positive and negative ion switching), and multiple-reaction monitoring. Ester forms of dinophysis toxins are detected as the parent toxins after hydrolysis of the methanolic extract. The method is quantitative for 6 key toxins when reference standards are available: azaspiracid-1 (AZA1), domoic acid (DA), gymnodimine (GYM), okadaic acid (OA), pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2), and yessotoxin (YTX). Relative response factors are used to estimate the concentrations of other toxins: azaspiracid-2 and -3 (AZA2 and AZA3), dinophysis toxin-1 and -2 (DTX1 and DTX2), other pectenotoxins (PTX1, PTX6, and PTX11), pectenotoxin secoacid metabolites (PTX2-SA and PTX11-SA) and their 7-epimers, spirolides, and homoYTX and YTX metabolites (45-OHYTX and carboxyYTX). Validation data have been gathered for Greenshell mussel, Pacific oyster, cockle, and scallop roe via fortification and natural contamination. For the 6 key toxins at fortification levels of 0.05-0.20 mg/kg, recoveries were 71-99% and single laboratory reproducibilities, relative standard deviations (RSDs), were 10-24%. Limits of detection were <0.02 mg/kg. Extractability data were also obtained for several toxins by using successive extractions of naturally contaminated mussel samples.

15993495,"Cadmium distribution was studied in different subcellular fractions of gill and hepatopancreas tissues of eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica. Oysters were exposed for up to 21 days to low sublethal Cd concentrations (25 microg L(-1)). Gill and hepatopancreas tissues were sampled and divided into organelle fractions and cytosol by differential centrifugation. Organelle content of different fractions was verified by activities of marker enzymes, citrate synthase and acid phosphatase for mitochondria and lysosomes, respectively. In both tissue types, there was a significant accumulation of cadmium in cytosol reaching 230-350 ng mg(-1) protein. Among organelles, mitochondria were the main target for Cd bioaccumulation in gills (250-300 ng mg(-1) protein), whereas in hepatopancreas tissues, the highest cadmium accumulation occurred in lysosomes (90-94 ng mg(-1) protein). Although 75-83% of total cadmium burden was associated with the cytosol reflecting high volume fraction of this compartment, Cd concentrations in organelle fractions reached levels that could cause dysfunction of mitochondria and lysosomes. Organ- and organelle-specific patterns of cadmium bioaccumulation support our previous in vivo studies, which showed adverse effects of cadmium exposures on mitochondrial oxidation in gills and on the lysosomal system of hepatopancreas. This may have important implications for the development of biomarkers of effect for heavy metals and for understanding the mechanisms of toxic effects of metals.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000135', 'D000818', 'D002104', 'D002498', 'D002950', 'D003600', 'D005880', 'D043143', 'D008247', 'D008928', 'D010125', 'D013054']","['Acid Phosphatase', 'Animals', 'Cadmium', 'Centrifugation', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase', 'Cytosol', 'Gills', 'Hepatopancreas', 'Lysosomes', 'Mitochondria', 'Ostreidae', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",Tissue-specific accumulation of cadmium in subcellular compartments of eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica Gmelin (Bivalvia: Ostreidae).,"['Q000378', None, 'Q000493', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None]","['metabolism', None, 'pharmacokinetics', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15993495,2006
15990151,"A home-modified atomic fluorescence detector (mAFS) has been employed for mercury and methylmercury determination in bivalves from the Andalusian coast (south Spain). This modification consists on the inclusion of a quartz flow cell into the detector, which increases the concentration of mercury atoms in the detector and therefore enhances sensitivity about two fold. Two analytical approaches for mercury speciation based on the coupling of gas chromatography on-line pyrolysis and mAFS (GC-Pyro-mAFS) have been tested. The first approach (Method 1) is based on aqueous ethylation followed by extraction into an organic solvent, and the second one (Method 2) in the extraction of monoalkylated mercury as chloride. Method 1 is a rapid procedure but not sensitive enough for the analysis of methylmercury in non-polluted sites (detection limit: 20 ng g(-1) as mercury, wet basis). The second one is quite more sensitive (detection limit: 0.2 ng g(-1), wet weight), but sample treatment is cumbersome and time-consuming. The optimum range for mercury determination for both methods are complementary and exhibit an overlapping measurable concentration range (OMCR) in which methylmercury can be indistinctly determined (75-100 ng g(-1) as mercury, wet basis). The suitability of both methods has been assayed with spiking experiences at levels within the OMCR with good recoveries. Both approaches have been validated with two certified reference materials (BCR-463, mercury and methylmercury in tuna fish; and NIST-2977, organic contaminants and trace metals in mussel tissue).

The seasonal influence on the MT and metal concentrations (higher values in winter-spring season, than in summer-autumn season) is more pronounced than the local site-specific influence. Furthermore, within each season a significant site-specific dependence on the MT and trace metal variations can be detected. An inverse relationship of mussel condition index (CI) and temperature with MT and trace metals levels indicates the influence of food abundance and mussel annual reproductive cycle. Substantially higher concentrations of both MT and Cd were recorded in mussels inhabiting estuarine locations, possibly indicating a markedly higher Cd bioavailability at these locations.

Mathematical models were applied to describe the uptake and elimination curves of the contaminants for SPMDs, and kinetic parameters, such as uptake rate constants, and equilibrium triolein/water partitioning coefficients were calculated. SPMD data showed a good fit to estimate rate constant and partition coefficient equations, but only those contaminants which partitioned mainly in the dissolved phase (alpha-HCH and dieldrin) were well explained for mussels. Poor conformity of the other contaminants indicated mussels uptake by routes other than diffusion, such as ingestion of algae. An apparent equilibrium state was only noted for alpha-HCH in mussels. Aldrin was not detected in mussels in the first few days of exposure, indicating potential metabolism of this compound. B[a]P was not detected in the triolein of SPMDs, which suggests that the membrane may act as a reservoir. Loss of spiked B[a]P from the triolein was evident in a depuration experiment, which may indicate transfer to the membrane. Rate constants for mussels were higher than those for SPMDs, but the reverse was true for partition coefficients. Overall, mussels and SPMDs had similar uptake rates for all compounds in this study, excluding p,p'-DDT and dieldrin.

However, few studies have systematically used multiple biomarkers in more than a single species to determine the variability of sublethal effects of a particular contaminant. In this study, three marine invertebrates, the shore crab Carcinus maenas, the common limpet Patella vulgata and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, were exposed over 7 days in the laboratory to environmentally realistic concentrations of the priority pollutant copper. A combination of molecular, cellular and physiological biomarkers was measured in each organism to detect the toxic effects of copper. Biomarkers included lysosomal stability (neutral red retention), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase activity), metabolic impairment (total haemolymph protein), physiological status (heart rate) and induction of protective metallothionein proteins. P. vulgata was the most sensitive to copper with significant effects measured in all biomarkers at concentrations of 6.1 microg Cu l(-1). In C. maenas, cellular and neurotoxic endpoints were affected significantly only at 68.1 microg Cu l(-1). Exposure to copper also induced metallothionein production in crabs. Over a 7-day exposure period, M. edulis was the most tolerant species to copper with significant effects being observed at the cellular level only at 68.1 microg Cu l(-1) . In all three species, cellular and neurotoxic pathways were more sensitive to disruption than physiological processes (protein and heart rate).

15123292,"In the past decades, shellfish culture has developed in a significant way around the world. However, culture areas are often subject to recurring anthropic pollution. The recrudescent presence of industrial wastes is a source of heavy metals and results in pollutant transfer towards the aquatic environment in estuarine areas. Because of their mode of life, bivalves, including mussels and oysters, are suggested as ideal indicator organisms. The development of techniques allowing the analysis of the effects of pollutants on bivalve biology may lead to the monitoring of pollutant transfer in estuarine areas. In this context, the effects of cadmium and mercury on defence mechanisms were analysed in Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas. Pollutant effects were tested in vitro on oyster haemocytes. Cell viability and enzymatic activities (esterase, peroxidase, aminopeptidase, phagocytosis activities) were monitored by flow cytometry. Enzymatic phenoloxidase-like activity was also evaluated by spectrophotometry. High pollutant concentrations were used in order to detect the acute effect and to approach real pollutant concentrations existing in animal tissues.

At the experimental concentrations tested (< 500 microgl(-1)), selenite and selenate did not significantly affect the uptake of either mercury species by the diatoms and the green mussels. The assimilation efficiency of Hg(II) and MeHg by the mussels from ingested diatoms was also independent of the inorganic Se loadings in the food particles. In contrast, selenomethionine significantly inhibited the uptake of MeHg and enhanced the uptake of Hg(II) by the diatoms and the mussels, but it did not affect the assimilation from the ingested diatoms. The influence of tissue body burden of Se in the green mussels following pre-exposure to selenite and selenomethionine for different periods (1-5 weeks) on the accumulation of Hg(II) and MeHg was further investigated. Our results showed that tissue Se concentrations did not significantly affect the dietary assimilation of mercury, but the influences on the aqueous uptake were variable. Our study thus, strongly highlights the specificity of the Se-Hg interaction in marine mussels for different Se and Hg species.

Up to the present, only four fat-soluble polyethers have been known as diarrhetic shellfish toxins. Among them,*** Okadaic acid, Dinophysistoxin-1, Dinophysistoxin-2 and Dinophysistoxin-3. Outbreaks associated with DSP have occurred in the Chilean Patagonia fjords since 1970. Native people, who live in small communities close to the southern fjords, smoke fresh shellfish. During this popular smoking procedure, they impregnate the shellfish with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as incomplete combustion products, which are potent carcinogenic compounds, this product is sold in local markets without phycotoxins analysis or inclusion in any monitoring program. The present paper shows, DSP phycotoxins quantitation, using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescent and mass spectrometric detection and the measurements of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by gas chromatography with mass detection, in smoked shellfish samples. The presence of Dinophysistoxin-3, the Dinophysistoxin-1 ester (7-O-acyl-derivatives of dinophysistoxin-1), was assessed in all shellfish samples analyzed. The 7-OH in Dinophysistoxin-1 was esterified with palmitic fatty acid. The shellfish meat contains seven polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, among them fluoranthene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed four of the six most frequent carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons reported.

The fish were caught in the Danube river downstream of the city of Budapest (Hungary). Ten out of twenty one elements analyzed were found at higher concentrations in the acanthocephalan than in different tissues (muscle, intestine, liver and kidney) of barbel. Considering the fish tissues, most of the elements were present at highest concentrations in liver, followed by kidney, intestine and muscle. Spearman correlation analyses indicate that there is competition for metals between the parasites and the host. The negative relationships between parasite number and metal levels in organs of the barbel support this hypothesis. The bioconcentration factors for Ag, As, Ba, Bi, Cu, Ga, Mn, Pb, Sr, Tl, and Zn showed that the parasites concentrated metals to a higher degree than the fish tissues. They accumulated the metals As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn even better than established bioindicators such as the mussel Dreissena polymorpha as revealed by data from the literature. The results presented here emphasize that acanthocephalans of fish are very useful as sentinels for metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems.

An illegal use of organotin antifouling paints on fishing nets was reported. In the line of pollution studies, thus, the present investigation was carried out to examine the contamination status and fate of organotin compounds. Totally, 23 water, 10 sediment and 8 pearl oyster tissue samples were analyzed for tributyltin (TBT), triphenyltin (TPT), and their breakdown products (di- and mono compounds) by gas chromatography combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC/ICP-MS). The results show that the TBT concentrations in water, sediment and biota were in the range from 0.11 to 10.6 ng Sn l(-1), 0.35 to 2500 ng Sn g(-1), and 50.4 to 181 ng Sn g(-1), respectively. The values for sediment and biota are expressed on the dry-weight basis. Triphenyltin in water, sediment and biota were in the range from 0.009 to 0.108 ng l(-1), non-detect to 12.7 ng g(-1), and non-detect to 6.83 ng g(-1), respectively. Although the TBT concentration in seawater is below the tentative assessment level of 10 ng l(-1) set by the Japanese Environment Agency in 1992, it may cause endocrine disruption/other effects in aquatic organisms.

14745772,"This paper describes the development of an accelerated solvent extraction methodology that is capable of simultaneously extracting organometallic species of As, Sn and Hg in a semi-automated manner. Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) methods based on previous research on the separate extraction of organotin and -arsenic species in our laboratory were adapted for the co-extraction of six different species from an oyster tissue certified reference material (BCR 710). For the first time, the extraction of MeHg by this technique is also investigated. The proposed ASE conditions employed 50% acetic acid in methanol at a temperature of 100 degrees C with up to five consecutive extraction cycles of 3 minutes. Extraction efficiencies for organoarsenic species ranged from 80% (dimethylarsinic acid, DMA) to 99% for arsenobetaine (AsB). Species of toxicological interest, such as dibutyltin (DBT), tributyltin (TBT) and methylmercury (MeHg), were extracted with mean recoveries of 81, 84 and 76%, respectively. The extracted species were analysed by gas chromatography/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC/ICPMS; DBT, TBT and MeHg) and liquid chromatography/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC/ICPMS; MMA, DMA, AsB) after ethylation with sodium tetraethylborate or dilution with water, respectively. In addition to those species for which the extraction efficiency was assessed during this study, a further five arsenic species (arsenite, arsenate and three unidentified species), as well as monobutyltin (MBT) and mono-, di- and triphenyltin, could also be extracted from other matrices.

14632122,"A rapid, accurate, sensitive, and simple method for simultaneous speciation analysis of mercury and tin in biological samples has been developed. Integrated simultaneous sample preparation for tin and mercury species includes open focused microwave extraction and derivatization via ethylation. Capillary gas chromatography-inductively plasma mass spectrometry (CGC-ICPMS) conditions and parameters affecting the analytical performance were carefully optimized both for species-specific isotope dilution analysis of MMHg and TBT and for conventional analysis of MBT and DBT201Hg-enriched monomethylmercury and 117Sn-enriched tributyltin were used for species-specific isotope dilution mass spectrometry (SIDMS) analysis. As important, accurate isotope dilution analysis requires equilibration between the spike and the analyte to achieve successful analytical procedures. Since the spike stabilization and solubilization are the most critical and time-consuming steps in isotope dilution analysis, different spiking procedures were tested. Simultaneous microwave-assisted spike stabilization and solubilization can be achieved within less than 5 min. This study originally introduces a method for the simultaneous speciation and isotope dilution of mercury and tin in biological tissues. The sample throughput of the procedure was drastically reduced by fastening sample preparation and GC separation steps. The accuracy of the method was tested by both external calibration analysis and species-specific isotope dilution analysis using the first biological reference material certified for multielemental speciation (oyster tissue, CRM 710, IRMM). The results obtained demonstrate that isotope dilution analysis is a powerful method allowing the simultaneous speciation of TBT and MMHg with high precision and excellent accuracy.

This simple hydride generation system was constructed in our laboratory and requires similar plasma operating conditions to conventional nebulizer-spray-chamber arrangements. This work was focused on the optimization of the operating conditions for hydride generation and evaluation of the main analytical figures of merit for the determination of As, Sb and Se. The excitation conditions of the ICP-OES instrument operated with the DHGN were also explored. Results showed that the analytical performance of the new system for the determination of As, Sb and Se was superior to that of conventional nebulization systems. The DHGN also enabled the determination of elements that do not form volatile hydrides, but with less sensitivity than conventional nebulization systems. Evaluation of the plasma robustness showed that gases generated in hydride generation do not significantly affects the plasma discharge. Similar to conventional hydride generation techniques, analysis with DHGN was susceptible to non-spectroscopic interferences produced by transition metals.

More and more oyster farmers supplement the diet of oysters by microalgae to optimize the fattening process and to improve both the growth and flesh quality of oysters. In the present study, oysters were supplemented by two microalgae: Skeletonema costatum and Tahitian isochrysis clone. The ash, protein, carbohydrate (including glycogen), and lipid contents were analyzed. The growth of oysters was improved when they were fattened with microalgae, leading to an increase in the condition index. The chemical composition of oysters was influenced by the chemical composition of the microalgae, especially the level of glycogen, which was significantly increased for oysters supplemented by microalgae. The fatty acid profile of oysters fattened by microalgae was positively correlated with the fatty acid profiles of S. costatum and T. isochrysis.

Mercury was measured by cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (CV AAS) and arsenic, lead and cadmium by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ET AAS). Quality control procedures of analytical methods, which included analyses of dogfish muscle-certified reference material DORM-2, confirmed the acceptability of methods. The highest mercury and arsenic concentrations were found in hake (Merluccius merluccius) and the lowest in mackerel (Scomber scombrus).

Up to 17 different species were determined within 15 min on an anion-exchange column, using a nitric acid gradient and an ion-pairing reagent. As all species are shown in one chromatogram, a clear overview of arsenic distribution patterns in different marine organisms is given. Arsenobetaine is the major compound in marine animals whereas arsenosugars and arsenate are dominant in marine algae. The method was validated with CRM DORM-2 (dogfish muscle).

Subsequent analysis of the oyster samples by LC-electrospray MS and comparison with four standard dimethylarsinoylribosides (arsenosugars), showed that the previously unidentified peak was an arsenosugar (arsenosugar 2). When the arsenosugar in the oyster was quantified using the two detection methods and external calibration with standard arsenosugar, there was a large discrepancy between the two sets of results. The LC-MS analysis was strongly affected by the sample matrix and gave concentrations 50% lower than those obtained by AFS detection. When the method of standard addition was applied to the LC-MS analysis, the results were comparable to the AFS data. The matrix effects were eliminated by subjecting the extract to a clean-up procedure with anion-exchange and gel permeation preparative chromatography before the LC-MS analysis.

11243323,"Alternative methodologies have been applied to the study of cadmium transfer in a food chain: water, microalgae (Skeletonema costatum and Tetraselmis suecica), oysters (Crassostrea gigas). The potential bioavailability of Cd in organisms was assessed through partitioning at the cell or tissue levels, and the predictive value of this method was evaluated by determining directly the metal transfer in an experimental food chain model. Cd concentrations were lower in S. costatum than T. suecica, in controls as well as in contaminated algae. In both algal species, Cd was firmly bound to the cell wall or had entered the cell. Cytosolic Cd was bound to intracellular ligands, the biochemical characteristics of which were not consistent with the hypothesis of detoxification via phytochelatins. In both algal species, Cd was predominantly present in the insoluble fraction, but at pHs such as those existing in the digestive tract of bivalves, it was easily extracted from the cells. Thus, exposure to Cd through phytoplanktonic food induced a significant uptake of this metal in soft tissues of bivalves. Due to the difference in Cd accumulation in algae, Cd doses associated with S. costatum were lower than those bound to T. suecica. Moreover, oysters retained a lower percentage of the metal associated with S. costatum compared to T. suecica (9 and 20%, respectively, after 21 days of exposure). Cd doses potentially available to oysters exposed directly in sea water were considerably higher, and direct uptake induced the highest levels of Cd incorporation but only 2% of dissolved Cd was actually retained by oysters over 21 days of exposure. In the soft tissues of oysters, Cd was distributed equally between soluble and insoluble fractions. Cytosolic Cd was present predominantly in the heat-stable fraction and mainly bound to compounds of molecular weight equal to 13.5 kDa. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between metallothionein-like protein (MTLP) levels and gross concentrations of Cd in the soft tissues of oysters. These data are consistent with the hypothesis of an important role of metallothioneins in Cd metabolism in oysters and suggest a potential availability of MT-bound fraction of Cd to the consumers.

11219056,"In order to estimate metal distribution patterns in biomolecules of different sizes and their possible relationship with environmental heavy metal contamination, multi-elemental distributions in different fractions of the cytosols of mussels were studied. To do so, samples were collected from natural populations of two coastal regions in Spain: a wild (uncontaminated) coast and an industrialised (contaminated) area in Asturias. Moreover, some commercial mussels from the Galicia coast were also investigated for comparison. Aliquots of the mussel cytosol extracts from each sample were applied to a calibrated Sephadex G-75 column (100 x 1 cm) and forty 3 ml fractions were obtained. After suitable dilution, 18 trace metals were determined by double focusing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (DF-ICP-MS). The use of DF-ICP-MS detection allowed the resolution of several spectral interferences that cannot be resolved by quadrupole ICP-MS. Accurate results for ultratrace elements at basal levels are possible even after sample dilution to prevent matrix effects. After biomolecule-metal association pattern has been established, quantitative analysis of mussel cytosols from the three coastal areas was carried out, using external aqueous calibration plus standard additions to correct for possible matrix effects. Results showed that total metal contents increased following the expected order: wild coast < Galicia coast < industrial area coast. Speciation of Cu, Zn, Ca, U, Ni, Mo, Mn, Cr, V, Cd, Al and Sb showed a similar distribution pattern among cytosolic ligands for all the studied samples.

11024496,"Automated pre-column oxidation (the method of Lawrence) was implemented on a routine basis since the end of 1996 to study paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins in Portuguese shellfish. Liquid chromatography confirmed the presence of PSP toxins when the known toxic algae were present: Gymnodinium catenatum and/or Alexandrium cf. lusitanicum. On the other side, it has eliminated PSP toxins as a possible recurrent contaminant in oysters from Sado estuary. These oysters were already known to contain high levels of some metals (mainly zinc, copper and cadmium) due to their location in a contaminated area and their particular physiology prone to accumulate metals. The presence of PSP toxins in Scrobicularia plana from Mondego estuary and Tellina crassa from the northern coast, during the absence of the above toxic microalgae in the water column, was confirmed. Unlike other shellfish, these two genera have the feeding habit of aspirating more sediment than organisms in suspension, and probably ingest from the sediment resting cysts of PSP producing microalgae. This is another route of contamination that may help to explain why after a bloom certain shellfish species maintain toxicity for long periods. The method revealed to have a fast implementation on a daily basis, short analysis time (around 20 min between samples), high sensitivity and robustness, and therefore, it is one of the best HPLC methods for screening a large number of shellfish samples for monitoring purposes.",Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,"['D000818', 'D002851', 'D051379', 'D008978', 'D010125', 'D010084', 'D057096']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Mice', 'Mollusk Venoms', 'Ostreidae', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Shellfish Poisoning']",Determination of paralytic shellfish toxins in Portuguese shellfish by automated pre-column oxidation.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11024496,2000

10912585,"Oil spills in Alaska, California, Maine, and other states have raised concerns regarding potential contamination of fish and shellfish, and have led to temporary closures of seafood harvests while health risks are assessed. Lacking standardized protocols, these assessments are generally ad hoc, site-specific efforts, with significant differences in risk evaluation criteria. This article describes the response of a state health agency to shellfish contamination following an oil spill on the Oregon coast, and discusses some of the factors that can complicate the evaluation of potential health risks from consumption of oil-contaminated shellfish. On 4 February 1999, the Japanese-owned cargo ship M/V New Carissa, carrying an estimated 400,000 gallons of light diesel and heavy fuel oil, ran aground 2 miles north of Coos Bay, Oregon. Damage to the ship's hull from the grounding and pounding surf caused the release of an estimated 25,000 to 70,000 gallons of oil. Concern for potential contamination of local recreational shellfish and commercial oyster beds prompted the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) to close shellfish harvesting in Coos and Douglas counties. ODA requested assistance from the Oregon Health Division in the derivation of risk-based criteria for reopening the shellfish harvest. Criteria were developed for the primary contaminants of concern, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) expressed as total benzo[a]-pyrene (BaP) equivalents. ""Safe"" (<10 microg/kg) and ""unsafe"" (>45 microg/kg) BaP equivalent levels were derived based on upper end (32.5 g/d) and average (7.5 g/d) estimates of shellfish consumption, respectively. Composite samples of oysters, clams, and mussels (15-20 per composite) were collected from target areas and analyzed for PAHs by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). Carcinogenic PAHs were converted to total BaP equivalents (wet weight) and compared with criteria. Two oyster samples, collected from a slough off of Coos Bay, contained 33.9 and 34.5 microg/kg BaP equivalents; all other samples had less than 10 microg/kg BaP equivalents. An evaluation of the PAH profiles in the two higher oyster samples indicated a primary source other than the New Carissa oil. Because shellfish sample BaP equivalents attributable to the New Carissa oil spill did not exceed 10 microg/kg, shellfish harvesting was reopened on 4 March 1999. This study revealed some of the inherent difficulties in attempting to quantify health risks from contaminated shellfish following an oil spill and demonstrated the clear need for standardized protocols for responding to such events.",Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

On the other hand, bivalves are regarded as very convenient bioindicators of the aquatic ecosystems and an extensive literature has been dedicated to their response to metals. Among studies supporting the involvement of MTs in metal detoxification some discrepancy appears due to inter- and intra-specific variations, or to heterogeneous exposure conditions. A lesser number of papers are dealing with the use of metallothionein levels as biomarkers, and sometimes they evidence that natural factors influencing metallothionein synthesis have to be taken into account before final conclusions can been drawn. Moreover, there is still a large number of non-intercalibrated protocols used to quantify amounts of metallothioneins in organisms. As comparisons are necessary to assess the relative abundance of metallothioneins in a studied species, more work has to be completed before such comparisons could be validated.

10398771,"Eight commercially and recreationally important marine species were collected in 1993 and 1994 from several Atlantic and Pacific coastal regions of the contiguous United States. Approximately 700 edible tissue samples (e.g., whole body of mussel, crustacean muscle and hepatopancreas, and fish muscle) were analyzed for dioxin-like chlorobiphenyls (CBs) and other selected CB congeners using a rapid high-performance liquid chromatography photodiode array detection method (HPLC/PDA). Total CBs and toxic equivalents (TEQs) of dioxin-like CBs were also determined. The most abundant congeners measured in these tissues were the moderately chlorinated CBs (e.g., CB 138, 153), with mean concentrations ranging from below the limits of detection (approximately 0.2 ng/g) to 1,500 ng/g, wet weight. Certain dioxin-like CBs (e.g., CBs 77, 105, 118, 126) were also found in several of these samples (mean concentrations ranging from below the limits of detection [approximately 0.4 ng/g] to 680 ng/g). Similar to previous studies, the majority of seafood tissues contained total CB concentrations that were below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) tolerance limit for CBs of 2,000 ng/g, wet weight (2.0 ppm). Furthermore, the majority of samples that contained CB levels below the FDA CB tolerance limit also had CB TEQs that were lower than the FDA's advisory level for TCDD (25 ppt or 25 pg/g, wet weight) in fish from the Great Lakes, which is used in evaluating CB TEQs. Several crustacean hepatopancreas samples collected from certain Atlantic and Pacific urban sites (e.g., Dungeness crab from Elliott Bay in Puget Sound, WA, American lobster from Deer Island in Boston Harbor, MA), however, did contain total CB and CB TEQs that exceeded the FDA CB tolerance and TCDD advisory limits. Mono-ortho- (e.g., CBs 118, 105) and non-ortho-substituted congeners (e.g., CBs 77 and 126) were the largest contributors to the CB TEQs of the hepatopancreas samples that exceeded the action limit.http://link.springer-ny. com/link/service/journals/00244/bibs/37n2p205.html",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D000818', 'D001267', 'D049872', 'D003386', 'D002851', 'D004147', 'D005412', 'D008121', 'D010140', 'D010473', 'D011078', 'D011786', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Atlantic Ocean', 'Bivalvia', 'Brachyura', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dioxins', 'Flatfishes', 'Nephropidae', 'Pacific Ocean', 'Perciformes', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Quality Control', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Analyses of tissues of eight marine species from Atlantic and Pacific coasts for dioxin-like chlorobiphenyls (CBs) and total CBs.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10398771,1999

The metal concentrations of the parasites were compared to those of different organs (muscle, liver, intestine) of the fish hosts and to those detected in the whole bodies of the respective intermediate hosts. The three acanthocephalan species analysed contained very high amounts of Pb and Cd. The lead level of Pomphorhynchus laevis was up to 2700 times higher and the cadmium concentration was approximately 500 times higher than the muscle of chub, its host. Concurrent analysis of larval acanthocephalans in the crustacean intermediate host indicated that the bioconcentration of heavy metals by these parasites occurs only in the final host. In two species of cestodes accumulation of metals was also recorded although the degree of bioconcentration was somewhat lower. Nevertheless, Monobothrium wageneri contained 75 times more Pb and 43 times more Cd than the muscle of its host, the tench. In contrast, no bioconcentration of heavy metals was detected in the swimbladder nematode Anguillicola crassus. It contained less lead than the muscle of its final host, the eel. In one biotope the concentration of 18 elements was compared between the whole soft tissues of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, the parasite Acanthocephalus lucii and its final host, perch. The acanthocephalan accumulated most of the elements to considerably higher concentrations than the zebra mussel, which has been considered an effective bioindicator of heavy metals. The sessile nature of the zebra mussel may allow a better identification of small-scale local differences in environmental heavy metal contamination.

9525046,"Trace metal concentrations (Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn) in Sydney rock oysters (Sacostera commercialis) and sediments (< 53 microns fraction) were determined for six sites in the northern regions of Botany Bay. Levels for lead, cadmium, copper and zinc in oysters ranged (in microgram g-1) from 1.38 to 15.3, 1.81 to 16.3, 56.1 to 212 and 1806 to 2902, respectively. In sediments, levels ranged (in microgram g-1) from 599 to 4081, 3.57 to 91.0, 191 to 1113 and 227 to 1472, respectively. Such values indicated high levels of contamination, especially in the sediments. Indeed, high proportions of the samples displayed metal concentrations that exceeded the prescribed limits for oysters and sediments. No significant correlations in metal concentrations were found between oysters and sediments, suggesting that changes in the sediment metal loading are not solely influencing the levels of bioavailable metal. The results supported the conclusion that different rates and mechanisms of metal accumulation are taking place in the two types of samples. Variability between sites was high, particularly for oysters. Multidimensional scaling identified that the Cooks River (site 3) and La Perouse (site 6) sites were most dissimilar, both to each other as well as to the other four sites. This was a reflection of high contamination in the Cooks River and the generally low levels in the La Perouse reference sample. The configuration was mainly influenced by the sediment parameters, rather than the oyster metal concentrations, indicating the sediment data were better for identifying site similarities.

9353875,"Oysters display a diversity of uptake mechanisms for metallic elements and distribution in the target organs, namely gills and the digestive gland. Various tissues of the flat oyster, Ostrea edulis, were studied following experimental exposure to 0.025 microM (5 micrograms l-1) of mercury, for up to 34 days. All animals survived the treatment. Data indicate Hg accumulation in gill tissue with a maximum concentration of 38.76 micrograms g-1 dry weight after 25 days of exposure. Hg levels were lower in remaining tissues, in which the maximum concentration (18.47 micrograms g-1 dry weight) was reached after 18 days of exposure. After these times, concentration in both tissues decreased. Results show that oysters can accumulate Hg from the environment, without their survival being affected during the experimental period. Structural alteration of epithelial tissues of gill and digestive gland of flat oyster was comparable with effects described for other metallic elements in bivalve molluscs. Interstitial tissue was disorganized in the digestive gland, and ultrastructural changes in intracellular endomembranes were detected in epithelial cells of the digestive gland after 18 days of treatment. After 25 days, absorptive epithelial cells of gills showed highly dilated, swollen microvilli.

9341231,"The enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), which catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide radical, is present in the cytosol and mitochondria of all oxygen-respiring eukaryotes. The cytosolic form contains copper and zinc (CuZnSOD), whereas the mitochondrial form contains manganese (MnSOD). The latter protein is synthesized in the cytosol as a MnSOD precursor, containing an N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting sequence. CuZnSOD is sensitive toward cyanide (CN) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but MnSOD is not. Assays for SOD activity in cytosol from the hepatopancreas of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, showed the presence of a CN/H2O2-insensitive form of SOD. No CN/H2O2-sensitive CuZnSOD was found. This unexpected phenomenon was shown to occur in all decapod crustacea (crabs, lobsters, shrimp) examined. The cytosolic and mitochondrial SODs of C. sapidus were purified by means of ion-exchange, size-exclusion, and reverse-phase HPLC. The cytosolic SOD is a homodimeric protein, which exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium (24 kDa left and right arrow 48 kDa). The protein contains approximately 1 Mn per subunit. No copper or zinc is present. Amino acid sequence analysis identified the novel cytosolic SOD as a MnSOD precursor with an abnormal mitochondrial-targeting sequence. The mitochondrial SOD of C. sapidus is similar to the MnSOD found in other eukaryotes. N-Terminal amino sequences of mitochondrial and cytosolic blue crab MnSOD differ in several positions. The MnSODs are thus encoded for by two different genes.

Attempts were made to identify the paralytic toxins in the starfish. They were extracted with 80% ethanol acidified with acetic acid, followed by defatting with dichloromethane. The aqueous layer obtained was treated with activated charcoal and then applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. The unbound toxic fraction was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. The starfish toxin was rather unexpectedly identified as PSP. It was comprised of high toxic components (gonyautoxin-1; GTX1, GTX2, GTX3, GTX4, decarbamoyl-GTX3; dcGTX3 and dcSTX) as the major components, which accounted for approximately 77 mole% of all components, along with protogonyautoxin-1, 2, 3 and 4 (PX1-4), which are N-sulfocarbamoyl derivatives. Of the high toxic components, GTX1 was present in the largest amounts.

8783452,"The rapidly expanding mariculture and commercial region along the southern coast of China has experienced sporadic outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning for nearly 30 years, yet virtually nothing is known of the nature of that toxicity or of the causative organisms. This study presents the first direct comparisons of the high performance liquid chromatography toxin composition profiles of shellfish implicated in paralytic shellfish poisoning outbreaks in Daya Bay with Alexandrium tamarense cultures established from those waters. The three cultures that were analyzed produced an unusually high proportion of the low potency N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins C1 and C2 (nearly 90% of the total), and only trace quantities of the other saxitoxin derivatives. Total toxicity was thus very low with mild acid extraction, ranging between 7.2 and 12.7 fmole cell-1, or 0.7-0.9 pg saxitoxin equiv. cell-1. Following acid hydrolysis using the standard AOAC extraction method, the dominant toxins in the cultures were gonyautoxins 2 and 3 and decarbamoyl gonyautoxins 2 and 3. Total potency increased fourfold to 2.6-3.4 pg saxitoxin equiv. cell-1 following acid hydrolysis. These cultures are thus at the low end of the range of toxicities recorded for members of the A. tamarense species complex. Two scallop samples and one mussel sample collected from Daya Bay during paralytic shellfish poisoning episodes in 1990 and 1991 were also analyzed following the AOAC extraction procedure. The toxin profiles were similar for the three shellfish samples, in that the same suite of toxins were present in each, but the relative proportion of those toxins varied. The dominant toxins were gonyautoxins 2 and 3 and toxins C1-C4. Total toxicity was 336 and 654 micrograms saxitoxin per 100 g meat for the scallop samples, and 723 for the mussels. Toxins C3,4 were present in the shellfish at up to 22 mole%, but were not detected in cultures, even when mild acid was used for extraction. Despite the otherwise similar nature of the culture versus the shellfish toxin signatures, the presence of C3,4 indicates that another strain or species of Alexandrium, or possibly a paralytic shellfish poisoning-producing species of another genus was responsible for the 1990 and 1991 paralytic shellfish poisoning outbreaks in Daya Bay. Since the cultures analyzed were of low intrinsic toxicity, A. tamarense may be more widespread along the south coast of China than is suggested by the sporadic pattern of past paralytic shellfish poisoning outbreaks. Blooms with high cell density are required to generate sufficient toxin to be dangerous. The alarming increase in algal blooms in Chinese waters due to persistent and growing pollution may make these low toxicity populations more problematic in the future.",Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,"['D000818', 'D002681', 'D002851', 'D003445', 'D003470', 'D004141', 'D056890', 'D005506', 'D006863', 'D006868', 'D008387', 'D012530', 'D013045', 'D014873']","['Animals', 'China', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Crustacea', 'Culture Media', 'Dinoflagellida', 'Eukaryota', 'Food Contamination', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis', 'Marine Toxins', 'Saxitoxin', 'Species Specificity', 'Water Pollutants']",Paralytic shellfish poisoning in southern China.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000633', 'Q000031', None, None]","[None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'toxicity', 'analogs & derivatives', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8783452,1996

This modification allows the analysis to work equally well on both clam and crab viscera and meat.

Sixteen months after the maximum level, domoic acid has not completely disappeared from the razor clams from the Washington State beaches.

1580419,"Arsenobetaine and arsenocholine are considered to be non-toxic and are present as a relatively large proportion of total arsenic in seafoods, and they do not respond to hydride generation. The present study describes the effect of seafood consumption on the urinary concentration of hydride-generating arsenic compounds measured by a newly developed flow injection atomic absorption spectrometric (FI-AAS) method. Consumption of plaice, pighvar and tunny resulted in a 2-fold increase, and consumption of mussels produced a 6-fold increase in the urinary level of hydride-generating arsenic compounds. Hence, a person who has consumed mussels may be suspected of being occupationally or environmentally exposed, if the level of consumption of this seafood is unknown. As the FI-AAS method cannot be used to detect arsenobetaine and arsenocholine, the observed increase in urinary concentration of hydride-generating arsenic compounds after consumption of seafood must originate either from hydride-generating arsenic compounds in the seafood or from degraded arsenobetaine or arsenocholine. The present study has demonstrated that both arsenobetaine and arsenocholine are unstable when incubated in daylight in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, i.e., an oxidizing environment. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that arsenobetaine could be converted into hydride-generating arsenic compounds during storage or cooking of seafood. The feasibility of speciation methods based on high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation and on-line analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and FI-AAS was also investigated.

1541252,"Three species of marine bivalve molluscs (Chamelea gallina, Ruditapes decussatus, and Crassostrea gigas) have been studied in order to evaluate the levels of pollution on the South Atlantic Spanish littoral. Several transition metals (Cu, As, Cd, Sn, Hg, Pb) were determined as a general index of total contamination. Animals from putative contaminated areas exhibited higher metal contents than those from cleaner waters. C. gigas showed 5-20-fold higher total metal content than the other two species. The mutagenicity of ethanolic extracts was assayed by using both the His reversion and the Ara forward mutation tests. Mollusc tissues from the three species did not contain genotoxins active on TA98 (frameshift mutations) or TA100 (mainly G:C base-pair substitutions), but did contain direct-acting genotoxins of a polar nature and oxidative type. This was based on the following observations: 1) mammalian metabolic activation was not required for mutagenicity, 2) mutagens were eluted with the polar fraction from XAD-2 columns, and 3) mutagenic responses were observed with Salmonella typhimurium TA102 (A:T base-pair substitutions; sensitive to oxidative damages) and Escherichia coli catalase-deficient (AraR forward mutations) strains. No relevant differences were found in the mutagenicity of mollusc extracts from areas with different pollution levels. Otherwise, our data suggest that, in general, animals living in contaminated environments had fewer genotoxins of oxidative type than those from less polluted areas. Such a result might be explained by the observation of increased levels of a number of detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione-peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. Thus, contaminated animals seem to be better protected against the oxidative damages induced by metals, in agreement with their lower malondialdehyde levels.

This may be a consequence of the extraction of lipids from the living tissues without sample storage. 4. One-third of the triacylglycerol fatty acids were polyunsaturated. In agreement with the importance of triacylglycerols in lipids of bivalve larvae, it is suggested that this lipid fraction may act as a temporary reservoir of physiologically-important polyunsaturated fatty acids. 5.

3709468,"The previously reported low molecular weight cadmium-binding protein (CdBP) from the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica, has been further purified and characterized by improved technical methods. The internal organ distribution of the protein within the oyster and effects of life cycle/season on CdBP production also have been evaluated. CdBP isolated by extended ion-exchange gradients or double ion-exchange chromatography followed by HPLC analysis possesses an electrophoretic Rf of about 0.7 and contains relatively little Zn, as previously reported. Cysteine, lysine, and glycine are the dominant amino acids. When ion-exchange columns are developed with NaCl gradients, the aromatic residues tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine are found to be present, but these may be largely removed depending upon whether the protein is denatured and carboxymethylated prior to analysis. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum of CdBP also was variable, with 250/280 nm ratios ranging from 17:1 immediately after ion-exchange chromatography to 2:1 following concentration procedures. Internal organ distribution studies showed that the visceral mass contained most of the Cd present with lesser amounts in the gills and mantle. In contrast with mammals, CdBP accounts for only about 30% of the total cell Cd burden in these tissues. Cu displacement of Cd from the protein is a particular problem during the summer spawning season and appears to stem from altered Cu metabolism during this period. Relative oyster dormancy during the winter also reduces CdBP production in response to Cd, and the protein is obtained most readily during the fall and spring.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Environmental health perspectives,"['D000596', 'D000818', 'D002104', 'D002850', 'D003300', 'D003545', 'D003600', 'D004591', 'D008668', 'D010125', 'D012621', 'D013056', 'D015032']","['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Cadmium', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Copper', 'Cysteine', 'Cytosol', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Metallothionein', 'Ostreidae', 'Seasons', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Zinc']","Purification and characterization studies of cadmium-binding proteins from the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica.","['Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000378']","['analysis', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'isolation & purification', 'analysis', None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3709468,1986

Re-examination of previously analysed gas chromatograms and archived samples revealed peaks that co-eluted with the authentic HCB standard. Levels of HCB were less than 1 ng/g in all samples re-examined, and were at least three to four orders of magnitude lower than those of poly-chlorinated biphenyls, two orders of magnitude lower than those of pyrene and one to two orders of magnitude lower than levels of either phenanthrene or benzo[a]-pyrene found in the same mussel samples. Chromatograms of sea water (dissolved and particulate phases) and sediments also revealed very low levels of HCB. Because gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results indicated that levels of HCB were below the level of detection it was not possible to verify its presence. The environmental data on HCB provided by the US Mussel Watch programme demonstrate that HCB levels in mussels are minor compared with other organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene). Mussels were transplanted to areas affected by industrial activity and by disposal of sewage sludge and dredged materials, and in relatively clean reference sites. Transplanted mussels were used to monitor the marine food chain, as surrogates for other biota in the same areas and as sentinel organisms to monitor localized differences in biologically available chemical compounds. The degree of environmental threat posed by HCB in the marine environment, as indicated by the US Mussel Watch data, is relatively low.

6425037,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) possess a low water solubility, a high n-octanol/water partition coefficient, and a high persistence, particularly those which are highly chlorinated. Because of these properties they are bioaccumulated in many organisms in the environment. PCBs are still manufactured industrially and used in the Mediterranean countries (e.g., Italy, Spain, and France). Production figures for these countries and for the FRG, the United Kingdom, and the United States between 1973 and 1979 are given. The concentrations of PCBs in marine air, water, sediments, microplankton , algae, mussels, fish, and other marine organisms including seabirds from the Mediterranean area are reviewed and compared with PCB concentrations in marine samples from non-Mediterranean regions. Levels of PCBs in seawater are highest in the western and central Mediterranean. The data for mussels and fish give a clear indication that the PCB levels are higher in the Northwest and the Tyrrhenian Sea than in the eastern Mediterranean.

Radioisotope dilution assays showed that only 75-97% of the Cbl chromatographed in the position of crystalline Cbl. The remaining 3-25% was present in a number of slower and faster moving fractions. This suggested that Cbl analogues are present in animal tissues because appropriate controls ruled out the possibility that this material was artifactually derived from Cbl during the extraction and purification procedures. With a large-scale isolation from rabbit kidney, the material in five such fractions contained cobalt and had absorption spectra that were similar to but different from the spectrum of Cbl, indicating that they were Cbl analogues. Compared to Cbl, these Cbl analogues had decreased but definite affinities for Cbl-binding proteins with the following order of strength of binding: R protein > transcobalamin II > intrinsic factor. Compared to Cbl, they also had decreased but definite growth-promoting activity for two microorganisms, Euglena gracilis and Lactobacillus leichmannii, which require Cbl for growth. These Cbl analogues differed from each other and from 18 synthetic Cbl analogues, including the most common Cbl analogues synthesized by microorganisms, in at least one of the above features.

940734,"Sediments, water, and oysters from the receiving waters of the Hahaione Valley, a suburban development in south-easter Oahu, Hawaii, were analyzed for organochlorine pesticidal compounds. The insecticides dieldrin, alpha- and gamma- chlordane, and p,p'-DDT were found in the study site environment. Levels were in the low parts per billion range for oysters and sediments and in the low parts per trillion range for water. During the past several years dieldrin residues in the marina study site have increased, even though the only activity known to influence pesticide levels in the valley is the chronic treatment for subterranean and dry wood termites. If present trends continue, dieldrin may pose a threat to biota of the aquatic environment. Findings have shown that residue levels of dieldrin and p,p'-DDT in the sediments are within the LD50 (median lethal dose) range for estuarine fish and thus may have a deleterious effect on bottom-feeding organisms.

Except for the jellyfish these animals belong to the protostomial branch of animal evolution, for which little information regarding DNA sequence organization has previously been available. The reassociation kinetics of short (250-300 nucleotide) and long (2,000-3,000 nucleotide) DNA fragments was studied by the hydroxyapatite method. It was shown that in each case a major fraction of the DNA consists of single copy sequences less than about 3,000 nucleotides in length, interspersed with short repetitive sequences. The lengths of the repetitive sequences were estimated by optical hyperchromicity and S1 nuclease measurements made on renaturation products. All the genomes studied include a prominent fraction of interspersed repetitive sequences about 300 nucleotides in length, as well as longer repetitive sequence regions.",Chromosoma,"['D000818', 'D001483', 'D005075', 'D049872', 'D003386', 'D002499', 'D002845', 'D003063', 'D004247', 'D004277', 'D003851', 'D004586', 'D006882', 'D007448', 'D009691', 'D009695', 'D009711', 'D010125', 'D010986']","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Bivalvia', 'Brachyura', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromatography', 'Cnidaria', 'DNA', 'DNA, Single-Stranded', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Electrophoresis', 'Hydroxyapatites', 'Invertebrates', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Nucleic Acid Renaturation', 'Nucleotides', 'Ostreidae', 'Platyhelminths']",DNA sequence organization in the genomes of five marine invertebrates.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/238802,1975

Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were maintained in a closed system, sealed aquarium with stirred, aerated water containing 10 mug of 203-HgCl2 per liter. Uptake of 203-Hg by oysters held under control conditions was compared with that of 203-Hg uptake by oysters under similar conditions except that mercury-accumulating and mercury-metabolizing species of Pseudomonas, isolated from Chesapeake Bay, were added to the experimental oysters. After incubation for 4 days, the major portion ofthe 203-Hg in the water column was found to be associated with the microparticulate fraction, corresponding to a rise in total viable count.
