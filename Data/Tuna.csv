35314979,"Carnosine is a naturally occurring dipeptide and a functional component in foods, while also showing health-promoting effects. Generally, food-derived carnosine is quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We have developed a method for quantifying carnosine in foods using microbial enzymes, β-Ala-Xaa dipeptidase (BapA) and histidine ammonia-lyase (HAL). The carnosine concentrations in extracts of chicken, pork, beef, bonito, and tuna were determined via both HPLC and enzymatic determination. The carnosine contents measured via enzymatic determination were in agreement with those determined via conventional HPLC analysis. Relative standard-deviation values of the conventional HPLC method and the enzymatic determination of carnosine in foods were 0.728-5.76% and 0.504-4.58%, respectively. The recovery of carnosine in food extracts via enzymatic determination was 97-103%. Therefore, the developed enzymatic determination technique using BapA and HAL can be used for the determination of carnosine in meats and fishes with comparable accuracy to that of conventional HPLC analysis.",Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002336', 'D002417', 'D004150', 'D005399', 'D006638', 'D008460', 'D016958']","['Animals', 'Carnosine', 'Cattle', 'Dipeptidases', 'Fishes', 'Histidine Ammonia-Lyase', 'Meat', 'Pseudomonas putida']",Enzymatic determination of carnosine in meat and fish using β-Ala-Xaa dipeptidase and histidine ammonia-lyase derived from Pseudomonas putida NBRC100650.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35314979,2022

35168046,"Plasmalogens are functional and oxidation-sensitive phospholipids abundant in fish. Chilling and freezing are common storage methods for maintaining the quality of fish, but their effect on plasmalogen preservation has not been studied. Therefore, plasmalogen loss in ready-to-eat tuna meat during storage under different conditions was investigated. LC/MS was used to analyze the time- and temperature-dependent changes of plasmalogens, which was the most evident for the species with an ethanolamine headgroup and polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains. Moreover, a series of oxidized plasmalogen molecules were identified, and their storage-induced accumulation was observed. Plasmalogen loss was strongly correlated with total lipid oxidation and phospholipid degradation. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles were found to accelerate the loss of plasmalogens, whereas the different thawing methods did not. The present study provides a deeper understanding of changes in lipid nutrients from fish meat during storage and demonstrates the importance of using advanced strategies to maintain food quality.",Food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002853', 'D008460', 'D010955', 'D053719', 'D014413']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Meat', 'Plasmalogens', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Tuna']",LC/MS analysis of storage-induced plasmalogen loss in ready-to-eat fish.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35168046,2022

34435208,"Additional occurrence data are needed to better understand human exposure to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from commercially available foods in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Total Diet Study (TDS) collects foods that are both nationally and regionally distributed. In 2018, 172 processed foods were collected from grocery stores around Lenexa, KS, as part of the TDS national collection. A previously developed method for the analysis of PFAS in foods as part of the TDS regional collection was modified and optimized for these samples. This method was single lab validated using 5 different matrices and method detection limits were calculated. During the analysis of these samples, challenges arose with method blanks and further investigation into statistical methods to distinguish between blank and sample concentrations were done. The confirmation of two short chain PFAS, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), was not possible using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and a confirmation method was developed using high-resolution mass spectrometry. This technique was also used to investigate potential detections and interferents that fell within the retention time criteria for positive detections. In the national collection, positive detections of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were found in frozen fish sticks/patties, PFOS and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) in canned tuna, and PFOS in protein powder.

34153828,"A mild-flavored soup stock made from katsuobushi is an important element of traditional Japanese cuisine and is the basic seasoning responsible for the taste. Fermented and ripened katsuobushi, known as karebushi, is manufactured by simmering skipjack tuna that is then smoke-dried, fermented, and ripened in a repeated molding process by five dominant Aspergillus species. Here, our aim was to characterize and identify the lipolytic enzymes secreted by the dominant Aspergillus species, especially A. chevalieri and A. pseudoglaucus, which are involved in hydrolyzing lipids during the molding process. The crude enzyme preparations from the five Aspergillus spp. cultivated on katsuobushi solid medium hydrolyzed triglycerides in fish oil, and more saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1) were produced than major polyunsaturated fatty acids (C20:5, C22:6). On the basis of ion exchange chromatograms, the composition of the lipolytic enzymes was different in the five species. There was at least one active fraction with high hydrolytic activity toward fish oil in four of the Aspergillus spp., but not A. sydowii; the lipolytic enzyme secreted by A. sydowii had quite high activity toward the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl butyrate, but low activity toward the natural oil. The lipolytic fractions from A. chevalieri and A. pseudoglaucus were further purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography then gel-filtration chromatography; LC-MS-MS Mascot analysis identified a variety of lipolytic enzymes, including cutinase, esterase, phospholipase, and carboxyl esterase in the lipolytic fractions from these species. The identified enzymes had 30%-70% identity to previously reported or manually annotated lipases or esterases from taxa other than Aspergillus. The different lipolytic enzymes likely acted on triglycerides in the katsuobushi fish oil. Furthermore, catalase B and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, which limit oxidative damage of lipids, were also identified. These antioxidant enzymes may prevent lipid oxidation and rancidity as the lipolytic enzymes hydrolyze lipids during the long fermentation and ripening process. Umami and richness tastes tended to increase in extracts from culture of protease- and peptidase-producing A. sydowii. Our results will aid in the selection and application of desirable strains of Aspergillus species as starter cultures to improve the storage and quality of fermented and ripened karebushi.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D000818', 'D000975', 'D001230', 'D005285', 'D005516', 'D050356', 'D008066', 'D014413']","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Aspergillus', 'Fermentation', 'Food Microbiology', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipolysis', 'Tuna']",Identification and characterization of extracellular enzymes secreted by Aspergillus spp. involved in lipolysis and lipid-antioxidation during katsuobushi fermentation and ripening.,"[None, None, 'Q000201', None, None, None, None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'enzymology', None, None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153828,2021

However, the knowledge regarding Hg-binding proteins in edible fish muscle is scarce. In the present study, salmon and tuna fish muscles, collected from seven different regions and countries, were analyzed using metallomics- and proteomics-based techniques. The concentration of Hg in sashimi samples ranged from 4.4 to 317.4 ng/g. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) showed that beta-actin was a novel Hg-binding protein from the fish muscles, and this protein could also bind bismuth (Bi), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu). Hg bound to beta-actin accounted for approximately 30.2-37.6% of the total Hg in the tuna muscles and was significantly correlated to total Hg in the fish muscles (r = 0.98, p < 0.01) and in the fraction of soluble proteins (r = 0.94, p < 0.01).

32311704,"Histamine is a biogenic amine, produced in spoiled fish and some fermented products, which causes a foodborne disease similar to an allergic reaction. Because regulatory levels on histamine in food have been set by many countries or organizations, a quick and accurate analysis of histamine is of great interest. An enzymatic histamine determination method on the basis of a colorimetric assay has been used to detect histamine for raw and canned tuna due to its simplicity and rapidity. However, note that some compounds in fermented foods interfere with assay results. In this study, the pretreatments and conditions of the assay for fermented foods were evaluated. Lowering the reaction temperature from 37 to 23°C was considerably effective in reducing the interference. As a result, histamine in salami and sauerkraut (≥5 to 10 mg/kg) could be determined with a 25-fold dilution, as in the manufacturer's instructions. Histamine in soy sauce (≥10 to 20 mg/L) could also be determined with a 100-fold dilution. Removing fat and protein in cheese samples by using perchloric acid with a resultant 25-fold dilution and removing polyphenol with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone for red wine with a fivefold dilution were feasible; the limits of quantification were 5 mg/kg and 1 mg/L, respectively.

31881513,"Bisphenol A (BPA), a known potential endocrine disrupting compound (EDC) is expected to be present in low quantities in canned food due to its migration from the inner surface coating of cans made of epoxy resins. A selective and confirmatory analytical method, based on microwave assisted extraction (MAE), molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction (MISPE) using a polymer prepared by a non-covalent molecular imprinting technique and liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) was developed for the determination of BPA in canned pineapple, tuna and mushrooms. First, the effect of the loading medium of hydro- organic solutions on the binding of BPA and its deuterated analogue on the MISPE sorbent was investigated. Subsequently, the effects of the experimental conditions of the microwave assisted extraction (solvent, sample mass/solvent volume, time and temperature) on the obtained recovery of BPA from canned food were assessed and the parameters were optimized to provide maximum recovery and selectivity. It was demonstrated that the combination of MAE with MISPE permits the use of a selective extraction solvent (methanol/water, 4/6, v/v), simplifying the sample preparation steps and enhancing sample clean-up of complex food matrices. The method was validated in different food matrices, using BPA-d16 as internal standard and quantitative relative recoveries were determined. The precision (RSD %) of the method ranged from 7% to 10% and the limit of detection was at low ng/g level for all food matrices.

31827314,"Scombroid fish poisoning caused by histamine intoxication is one of the most prevalent allergies associated with seafood consumption in the United States. Typical symptoms range from mild itching up to fatal cardiovascular collapse seen in anaphylaxis. In this paper, we demonstrate rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of histamine in both artificially spoiled tuna solution and real spoiled tuna samples using thin layer chromatography in tandem with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (TLC-SERS) sensing methods, enabled by machine learning analysis based on support vector regression (SVR) after feature extraction with principal component analysis (PCA). The TLC plates used herein, which were made from commercial food-grade diatomaceous earth, served simultaneously as the stationary phase to separate histamine from the blended tuna meat and as ultra-sensitive SERS substrates to enhance the detection limit. Using a simple drop cast method to dispense gold colloidal nanoparticles onto the diatomaceous earth plate, we were able to directly detect histamine concentration in artificially spoiled tuna solution down to 10 ppm. Based on the TLC-SERS spectral data of real tuna samples spoiled at room temperature for 0 to 48 hours, we used the PCA-SVR quantitative model to achieve superior predictive performance exceling traditional partial least squares regression (PLSR) method.

The tuna samples were collected from the Indian Ocean. The instrument conditions gave high mass accuracy at 0.9 m/z isolation width of the mass filter and a mass error of <±1.0 ppm for many HPAHs. A total of 29 of the 30 targets chlorinated PAHs (ClPAHs) and 20 of the 21 targets brominated PAHs (BrPAHs) were detected in the tuna muscle samples. The mean total ClPAH, BrPAH and PAH concentrations for tuna were 127.2, 156.6 and 682.8 ng/g lipid weight, respectively. The mean total ClPAH and BrPAH concentrations (ng/g lipid weight) in the tuna were considerably lower than that of PAH concentrations. The mean total ClPAH, BrPAH and PAH concentrations in T. albacares respectively were 185.8, 249.2 and 784.1 ng/g lipid weight, irrespective of the body sizes. The mean total ClPAH, BrPAH and PAH concentrations in K. pelamis respectively were 45.1, 24.8 and 555.6 ng/g lipid weight. The mean total ClPAH, BrPAH and PAH concentrations in A. thazard respectively were 34.09, 4.73 and 433.24 ng/g lipid weight. The total ClPAH concentrations and body weights significantly positively correlated for T. albacares. The mean total ClPAH concentration in white muscles was significantly higher (p < 0.05) for large than for small T. albacares. This suggests ClPAHs could bioaccumulate in T. albacares, possibly because they are poorly metabolized.

31576869,"The oxidation of unsaturated fats generally occurs at the oil-water interface of emulsions, so surface-active antioxidants are needed for inhibiting lipid oxidation. In this study, a scallop gonad protein isolate (SGPI)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) conjugate was fabricated and characterized as an amphiphilic surface-active antioxidant in improving the physicochemical and oxidative stability of tuna oil-loaded emulsions via a free-radical grafting method. The covalent binding of EGCG to SGPIs was verified by using electrophoresis and gel permeation chromatography. Meanwhile, the structural, physical, thermal, as well as the in vitro antioxidant properties of the SGPI-EGCG conjugate were further characterized. The results indicated that the SGPI-EGCG conjugate contained more β-sheet but less α-helix than SGPIs, leading to the changes of the secondary and tertiary conformation stability after conjugation. The radical scavenging and oxygen radical absorbance capacity of SGPIs were significantly increased by 4.9 times and 7.4 times, respectively, after the EGCG-grafting reaction. Compared with that stabilized by SGPIs, tuna oil emulsions emulsified by the SGPI-EGCG conjugate exhibited a smaller particle size and better storage stability. Furthermore, the SGPI-EGCG conjugate inhibited lipid and fatty acid oxidation during storage more significantly in tuna oil emulsions than SGPIs due to its higher interfacial accumulation and antioxidant activities. These results suggested that the SGPI-EGCG conjugate could be utilized as an efficient surface-active antioxidant and emulsifier for the encapsulation and protection of unsaturated lipids.",Food & function,"['D000818', 'D000975', 'D001704', 'D002392', 'D002942', 'D045703', 'D004655', 'D005227', 'D005395', 'D029941', 'D005609', 'D006066', 'D050356', 'D010084', 'D049897', 'D013056', 'D017550', 'D014413']","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Biopolymers', 'Catechin', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Emulsifying Agents', 'Emulsions', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fish Oils', 'Fish Proteins', 'Free Radicals', 'Gonads', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Pectinidae', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Tuna']",Fabrication of surface-active antioxidant biopolymers by using a grafted scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) gonad protein isolate-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) conjugate: improving the stability of tuna oil-loaded emulsions.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576869,2020

30775780,"Alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amines, and sulfur compounds are essential aroma compounds related to fish flavor and spoilage. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is an instrument that is widely used to identify and quantify volatile and semi-volatile compounds in fish products. In this research, a simple and accurate GC-MS method was developed to determine the aroma profile of mahi-mahi and tuna for chemical indicators of spoilage. In the developed GC-MS method, trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution was used to extract analytes from homogenized fish samples. The purge and trap system was used for sample introduction, and the GC-MS with an RTX-Volatile Amine column was able to separate compounds without a derivatization procedure. The created purge and trap gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (PT-GC-MS) method could identify and quantify twenty aroma compounds in mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) and 16 volatile compounds in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) associated with fish spoilage. The amines (dimethylamine, trimethylamine, isobutylamine, 3-methylbutylamine, and 2-methylbutanamine), alcohols (2-ethylhexanol, 1-penten-3-ol and isoamyl alcohol, ethanol), aldehydes (2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, benzaldehyde), ketones (acetone, 2,3-butanedione, 2-butanone, acetoin), and dimethyl disulfide strongly statistically correlated with poorer quality tuna and mahi-mahi and were considered as the key spoilage indicators. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: A simplified and rapid purge and trap gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (PT-GC-MS) method developed in this research was able to identify and quantify important spoilage compounds in mahi-mahi and yellowfin tuna. This method is an efficient analytical method for determining volatile profiles of fish samples for industry analytical labs or the government.

There is little information on the amount of ZnO NP that are present in food packaging and the effects of ZnO exposure on intestinal function. To estimate physiologically relevant ZnO exposures, foods that are naturally low in zinc (Zn), but are commonly packaged with ZnO NP, such as tuna, corn, and asparagus, were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). It was found that the Zn present in a serving of these foods is approximately one hundred times higher than the recommended dietary allowance. An in vitro model of the small intestine composed of Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells was used to investigate the effects of ZnO NP exposure. Cells were exposed to physiologically realistic doses of pristine NP in culture medium and to NP subjected to an in vitro digestion to better reflect the transformation that the NP may undergo once they enter the human GI tract. Uptake and/or transport of iron (Fe), Zn, glucose, and fatty acids were assessed and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) levels were measured before and after NP exposure. The findings show that there is a 75% decrease in Fe transport and a 30% decrease in glucose transport following ZnO NP exposure. These decreases were consistent with gene expression changes for their transporters. There is also evidence that the ZnO NP affect the microvilli of the intestinal cells, therefore reducing the amount of surface area available to absorb nutrients.

HEPES buffer exerted stronger interactions with XO or TPH, causing a lower α-helical content in XO and consequently a lower XO catalytic activity but greater XO inhibition, compared to Tris and PB buffers.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000818', 'D002021', 'D002942', 'D004791', 'D004795', 'D000078504', 'D005511', 'D006531', 'D006863', 'D010710', 'D017510', 'D011492', 'D017433', 'D017747', 'D013050', 'D013329', 'D014325', 'D014413', 'D014969']","['Animals', 'Buffers', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Fish Proteins, Dietary', 'Food Handling', 'HEPES', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Phosphates', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Hydrolysates', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Seafood', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tromethamine', 'Tuna', 'Xanthine Oxidase']",Effect of different buffer systems on the xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) protein hydrolysate.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000302', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000302', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000037']","[None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', None, 'isolation & purification', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'isolation & purification', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'antagonists & inhibitors']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433247,2019

This study examined residual concentrations in water, sediments, and fishes as well as the association between the health risks of OCPs and fish consumption in the Taiwanese population. Various water and sediment samples from Taiwanese aquaculture and fish samples from different sources were collected and analyzed through gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine the concentrations of 20 OCPs, namely, aldrin; cis-chlordane; trans-chlordane; dieldrin; endrin; alpha-endosulfan; beta-endosulfan; heptachlor; hexachlorobenzene; alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane; beta-hexachlorocyclohexane; lindane; mirex; pentachlorobenzene; o,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT); p,p'-DDT; and DDT metabolites (o,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane [DDD]; p,p'-DDD; o,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE]; and p,p'-DDE). None of the analyzed samples was positive for OCP contamination, suggesting no new input pollution from the land through washing into Taiwanese aquaculture environments. However, OCP residues were detected in fishes caught along the coast, namely, skipjack tuna and bigeye barracuda, and in imported fishes, such as codfish and salmon. DDT was the predominant pesticide. The contamination pattern of persistent organic pollutants was as follows: dieldrin > cis-chlordane > hexachlorobenzene, with average concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 2.74 ng/g. The risk was assessed in terms of the estimated daily intake (EDI) for potential adverse indices; the EDI of OCP residues was lower than 1% of the acceptable daily intake established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization. The assessed risk was negligible and considered to be at a safe level, suggesting no association between fish consumption and risks to human health in Taiwan.

27845248,"This study examined the fatty acid composition of three sympatric tropical tuna species (bigeye Thunnus obesus, yellowfin T. albacares and skipjack tuna Kastuwonus pelamis) sampled in the Western Indian Ocean in 2013. The fatty acid compositions of neutral and polar lipids, respectively involved in energy storage and cell membrane structure, were explored and compared in four tissues (red and white muscles, liver and gonads), according to biological (size, sex and maturity) and environmental (season and area) factors. The liver and the red muscle were the fattest tissues (i.e., higher levels of storage lipids) in all species and polar lipids were the lowest in the white muscle. Species and tissue types explained most differences in fatty acid compositions, while environmental factors had limited effects, except in the hepatic cell membrane where fatty acid composition varied with monsoons. Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) was the major fatty acid in both polar and neutral lipid fractions, especially in muscles. Eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and oleic acid (18:1n-9) were in higher proportion in neutral than in polar lipids. Arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and 22:6n-3, together with docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-6) and stearic acid (18:0), showed preferential accumulation in polar lipids. 20:4n-6 was particularly involved in cell membranes of ovary and white muscle. Overall, an important inter-individual variability in fatty acid compositions of structural lipids was found within tissue types despite considering biological factors that are most likely to influence this type of lipids. It suggests that fatty acid profiles are influenced by individual-specific behaviors.","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Direct Mercury Analyzer (DMA-80) was implemented for determination of total Hg level and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) was employed for determination of Cd and Pb concentrations. The results indicated that Hg had the highest concentration level and Cd had the lowest concentration level either in tested canned tuna or fresh little tunny samples. The average concentration of Hg in fresh little tunny samples was 1.185 ± 0.968 mg kg(-1) wet weight (ww) and often exceeded the standard permissible limit. In addition, canned yellowfin tuna had the lowest levels of Cd (0.027 ± 0.026 mg kg(-1) ww), Pb (0.075 ± 0.071) and Hg (0.163 ± 0.122 mg kg(-1) ww).

26511394,"A critical component of the biogeochemical cycle of mercury (Hg) is the transformation of inorganic Hg to neurotoxic monomethylmercury (CH3Hg). Humans are exposed to CH3Hg by consuming marine fish, yet the origin of CH3Hg in fish is a topic of debate. The carbon stable isotopic composition (δ(13)C) embedded in the methyl group of CH3Hg remains unexplored. This new isotopic information at the molecular level is thought to represent a new proxy to trace the carbon source at the origin of CH3Hg. Here, we present a compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) technique for the determination of the δ(13)C value of CH3Hg in biological samples by gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry analysis (GC-C-IRMS). The method consists first of calibrating a CH3Hg standard solution for δ(13)C CSIA. This was achieved by comparing three independent approaches consisting of the derivatization and halogenation of the CH3Hg standard solution. The determination of δ(13)C(CH3Hg) values on natural biological samples was performed by combining a CH3Hg selective extraction, purification, and halogenation followed by GC-C-IRMS analysis. Reference δ(13)C values were established for a tuna fish certified material (ERM-CE464) originating from the Adriatic Sea (δ(13)C(CH3Hg) = -22.1 ± 1.5‰, ± 2 SD). This value is similar to the δ(13)C value of marine algal-derived particulate organic carbon (δ(13)CPOC = -21‰).",Analytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002247', 'D005504', 'D008401', 'D008767', 'D014413']","['Animals', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Food Analysis', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Tuna']",Carbon Stable Isotope Analysis of Methylmercury Toxin in Biological Materials by Gas Chromatography Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511394,2016

25993845,"Fish collagen is known to have good moisturising property and antioxidant ability, which has been increasingly added into cosmetics, foods and drinks as thicker agent and to increase dietary supply of collagen. Fish collagen peptide (FCP) is a white or pale yellow powder, obtained by extracting collagen from sources including the scales and bones of fish such as bonito, halibut, tuna, and sea bream. It is identical to human collagen and 100% absorbable through the skin. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major constituent of green tea, has lots of beneficial biological and pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, antimutagenic, antiviral and antiinflammatory activities. Because proteins have the desirable formulation of EGCG-fortified food, the interaction between proteins and EGCG molecules has been widely studied. At the same time, the interaction of proteins and EGCG was known to affect the content of free EGCG, structure of proteins, antioxidant capacity of EGCG in foods. But, to our knowledge, the interaction between FCP and EGCG has not been characterised clearly, and little is known about their interaction mechanism. Therefore, a better understanding of the interaction between FCP and EGCG would help to control their functional properties in food products during processing, transportation and storage when we facilitate FCP as the vehicles for EGCG. In view of the above, we planned to study the interaction of FCP with EGCG by using different spectroscopic techniques, such as fluorescence spectroscopic, FTIR, CD and Raman. EGCG caused a concentration dependent quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of tyrosine residue in the FCP, indicating the occurrence of interactions between FCP and EGCG. Excimer-like species and dityrosine were regularly formed with the addition of EGCG into the solution, and the interaction of FCP and EGCG partly disrupted the structure-of the protein. Synchronous fluorescence results indicate that the interaction caused decrease of the polarity around tyrosine residues resulting in FCP conformation alteration. FTIR showed that the frequency of 3 281 and 1 248 cm-1 declined, the absorption peaks at 3 076 and 1 547 cm-1 had a slight red-shift, the absorption peaks at 1 659 and 1 689 cm-1 had a slight blue-shift in the FCP-EGCG complexes. It is interesting to observe that the CD intensity of FCP around 198 nm decreased with high EGCG concentration, and the peak maximum shifted to a larger wavelength (red shift). Raman spectra showed that peaks at 863 and 932 cm-1 had a slight red-shift, and decreased intensities near 932 cm-1 suggested that more exposure of proline when FCP-EGCG complexes formed.

25923316,"Influence of amino acid compositions and peptide profiles on antioxidant capacities of two protein hydrolysates from skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) dark muscle was investigated. Dark muscles from skipjack tuna were hydrolyzed using five separate proteases, including pepsin, trypsin, Neutrase, papain and Alcalase. Two hydrolysates, ATH and NTH, prepared using Alcalase and Neutrase, respectively, showed the strongest antioxidant capacities and were further fractionated using ultrafiltration and gel filtration chromatography. Two fractions, Fr.A3 and Fr.B2, isolated from ATH and NTH, respectively, showed strong radical scavenging activities toward 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals (EC50 1.08% ± 0.08% and 0.98% ± 0.07%), hydroxyl radicals (EC50 0.22% ± 0.03% and 0.48% ± 0.05%), and superoxide anion radicals (EC50 1.31% ± 0.11% and 1.56% ± 1.03%) and effectively inhibited lipid peroxidation. Eighteen peptides from Fr.A3 and 13 peptides from Fr.B2 were isolated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and their amino acid sequences were determined. The elevated antioxidant activity of Fr.A3 might be due to its high content of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acid residues (181.1 and 469.9 residues/1000 residues, respectively), small molecular sizes (3-6 peptides), low molecular weights (524.78 kDa), and amino acid sequences (antioxidant score 6.11). This study confirmed that a smaller molecular size, the presence of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acid residues, and the amino acid sequences were the key factors that determined the antioxidant activities of the proteins, hydrolysates and peptides.

25761066,"Recently, obesity has increased due to a variety of reasons, including the availability of 'fast food' and high-fat diets. Developing anti-obesity functional drugs and foods from natural sources may offer solutions to this global concern. Generally, tuna is a high-protein, low-fat and low-calorie food with various bioactive effects. It may improve memory, reduce cholesterol levels and positively affect the development of brain cells. In this study, we screened the anti-obesity potential of peptides derived from tuna protein. We then observed protein bands by the Coomassie blue staining of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel. The protein mixture was concentrated and desalted using in-gel trypsin digestion and a C18 nano column and Poros R2 reversed-phase preparation, prior to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS/MS). We screened the peptides for their ability to affect adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We also measured glucose uptake, triglyceride levels and lipid droplets using Oil Red O staining. As a result, we confirmed that one peptide inhibited adipocyte differentiation. We also observed the expression of obesity-related genes by western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The peptide from the tuna extract significantly reduced the expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBP-α) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) adipocyte marker genes. Thus, our data suggest that this peptide from boiled tuna extract reduces lipid components and adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells, and these characteristics may be of value in the development of anti-obesity foods.",International journal of molecular medicine,"['D041721', 'D017667', 'D050156', 'D000818', 'D022763', 'D002454', 'D015536', 'D005786', 'D005947', 'D050356', 'D051379', 'D047495', 'D010455', 'D014413']","['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Adipocytes', 'Adipogenesis', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glucose', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Mice', 'PPAR gamma', 'Peptides', 'Tuna']",Peptide derived from desalinated boiled tuna extract inhibits adipogenesis through the downregulation of C/EBP-α and PPAR-γ in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, 'genetics', 'drug effects', None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', None, 'genetics', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25761066,2015

25498559,"A simple instrumental procedure was developed to carry out the not simple analysis of PCBs in fish samples. PCBs with the same degree of chlorination (the isomers) are expected to be totally indistinguishable among them by all existing detectors and by all existing mass spectrometers, and there is no apparent solution in those frequent cases where two isomers chromatographically coelute. Generally such coelutions are solved by means of multidimensional GC, but it is a complex technique impractical for most laboratories. The present research focuses on the seven important ""indicator PCBs"" by using the mass spectrometer in an innovative way. The ""mass spectrometric ortho effect"" was usefully exploited in addressing coelutions between isomers. Other new important observations on mass spectra were decisive in solving the apparent problem arising from coelutions between higher chlorinated PCBs with the lower chlorinated ones when low-resolution MS is used. With the proposed procedure, the seven indicators are analyzed in a simple way and with a degree of accuracy never observed with the conventional gas chromatography. The method was applied to some Bluefin Tuna fish samples of big size suspected to have not negligible levels of PCBs due to the high position of this species in the food chain. The supposition was partly confirmed.

They provide versatile signatures that are being increasingly employed to delineate the transfer of dietary material through marine and terrestrial food webs. The standard procedure for determining fatty acids generally involves lipid extraction followed by methanolysis to produce methyl esters for analysis by gas chromatography. By directly transmethylating ~50 mg wet samples and adding an internal standard it was possible to greatly simplify the analytical methodology to enable rapid throughput of 20-40 fish tissue fatty acid analyses a day including instrumental analysis. This method was verified against the more traditional lipid methods using albacore tuna and great white shark muscle and liver samples, and it was shown to provide an estimate of sample dry mass, total lipid content, and a condition index. When large fatty acid data sets are generated in this way, multidimensional scaling, analysis of similarities, and similarity of percentages analysis can be used to define trophic connections among samples and to quantify them.

Study population consisted of 1,866 adults (839 men and 1,027 women) in randomly-selected 30 districts in southeast Korea. Dietary mercury intake was calculated from food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) on seafood items and 24 hr recall record. Blood mercury concentration was measured with atomic absorption spectrometry. Mean age of the subjects was 43.5 ± 14.6 yr. The FFQ showed that mercury-laden fish (tuna, shark) and frequently-eating fish (squid, belt fish, mackerel) were important in mercury intake from fish species. The recall record suggested that fish and shellfish was a highest group (63.1%) of mercury intake and had a wide distribution in the food groups. In comparison with the blood mercury concentration, age group, sex, household income, education, drinking status and coastal area were statistically significant (P < 0.001). In multiple regression analysis, coefficient from the FFQ (β = 0.003) had greater effect on the blood mercury than the recall record (β = 0.002), but the effect was restricted (adjusted R(2) = 0.234).

23675611,"Heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which are formed during the cooking of protein-rich foods, are potent mutagens and a risk factor for human cancers. Levels of HCAs have been extensively investigated in meat products but not in fish products. Here, we report levels of HCAs in fried salmon, tuna, hake, sardine, angler fish, cod, sole, swordfish, squid, and cuttlefish. The HCA levels of some of these foods have not been previously analyzed. We employed multivariate factor-analysis tools, including principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares (PLS) regression, to study the effects of cooking weight loss and levels of creatine, glucose, and free amino acids on HCA levels. The highest concentrations of mutagenic HCAs, 159.3 ng·g(-1) total, where 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) accounted for 121 ng·g(-1), were found in fried swordfish (cooking loss of 51.8%). These levels are higher than those generally found in fried chicken, which is typically cited as the most contaminated food item. Thus, swordfish is among the richest known sources of HCAs. The other cooked seafood items contained from 0.4 to 35.4 ng·g(-1) HCAs, comparable to concentrations typically reported for meat. Chemometric analysis showed that the fish species is the most influential parameter on the formation of HCAs such as DMIP, PhIP, and norharman. Concentrations of histidine, lysine, creatine, and glucose, as well as weight loss, also influence the yield of HCAs. These results suggest that seafood is an important dietary source of HCAs.

23614538,"This paper reports, for the first time, the development of an analytical method employing modified matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) for the extraction of CH3Hg(+) and Hg(2+) species from fish samples. Separation and determination of mercury species were performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Important MSPD parameters, such as sample mass, type and mass of solid support, concentration of extraction solution (HCl and NaCl), and stirring time, were investigated by the response surface methodology. The derivatization step and the separation of mercury species were also evaluated for the determination by GC/MS. Quantitative recoveries were obtained with 0.2 g of fish sample, 0.5 g of SiO2 as the solid support, 0.5 mol L(-1) NaCl and 4.2 mol L(-1) HCl as the extraction solution, and 1 min stirring time. The MSPD method showed to be suitable for the extraction and determination of mercury species in certified reference materials of dogfish liver (DOLT-3) and dogfish muscle (DORM-2). It had good agreement (about 99%) with the certified values, and the relative standard deviation was lower than 9.5%. The limits of detection were 0.06 and 0.12 μg g(-1), for CH3Hg(+) and Hg(2+), respectively. A matrix effect was observed, and the quantification was carried out by the matrix-matched calibration. The method was applied to tuna fish ( Thunnus thynnus ), angel shark ( Squatina squatina ), and guitarfish ( Rhinobatos percellens ) samples.

Thus, the sarcoplasmic fraction contained myoglobin and several enzymes that are essential for efficient energy production, whereas the myofibrillar fraction had important contractile proteins, such as actin, tropomyosin, myosin or an isoform of the enzyme creatine kinase.

22699869,"In this study, the binding behaviour of methylmercury (MeHg(+)) towards proteins is investigated. Free sulfhydryl groups in cysteine residues are known to be the most likely binding partners, due to the high affinity of mercury to sulphur. However, detailed knowledge about discrete binding sites in living organisms has been so far scarce. A metallomics approach using different methods like size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as well as complementary mass spectrometric techniques (electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry, ESI-MS/MS) are combined to sequence and identify possible target proteins or peptides after enzymatic digestion. Potential targets for MeHg(+) in tuna fish muscle tissue are investigated using the certified reference material CRM464 as a model tissue. Different extraction procedures appropriate for the extraction of proteins are evaluated for their efficiency using isotope dilution analysis for the determination of total Hg in the extracts. Due to the high chemical stability of the mercury-sulphur bond, the bioconjugate can be quantitatively extracted with a combination of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Using different separation techniques such as SEC and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it can be shown that major binding occurs to a high-molecular weight protein (M(w) > 200 kDa).

A copper electrode was embedded inside the inner quartz tube and sample solution was applied onto the outer surface of the inner tube. The effects of operating parameters such as plasma power, plasma gas identity, plasma gas flow rate and interferences from concomitant elements have been investigated. The difference in the sensitivities of Hg(2+), methylmercury (MeHg) and ethylmercury (EtHg) was found to be negligible in the presence of formic acid (≥1% v/v).

This method gives toxicological meaning to arsenic analysis, since the sum of the toxic chemical forms As(III) and As(V) can be determined. In contrast to classical water-methanol extraction, UAEE enables drastic acceleration of sample extraction (5 min instead of several hours), while total arsenic extraction efficiency is improved without species conversion. Validation was performed to evaluate the method for selectivity, linearity, LOD/LOQ (0.007-0.020 mg/kg), trueness, precision (HorRat values, 0.2-0.6), recovery (93-122%), and uncertainty.

It was hypothesized that food, beverages, cosmetics or medications could be a source of contamination of 2-aminoacetophenone in breath. To determine the potential confounding of these products on 2-aminoacetophenone breath analysis, screening for this volatile was performed in the laboratory by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a food challenge study carried out. 2-Aminoacetophenone was detected in four of the 78 samples tested in vitro: corn chips and canned tuna (high pmol mol(-1)) and egg white and one of the three beers (low pmol mol(-1)).

The procedure involves extraction with 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, separation and determination of mercury species by HPLC-ICPMS using a Perkin-Elmer 3 μm C8 (33 mm×3 mm) column and a mobile phase 3 containing 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and 5% (v/v) CH(3)OH (pH 5.5) at a flow rate 1.5 ml min(-1) and a temperature of 25°C. Calibration curves for methyl mercury (I) and mercury (II) standards were linear in the range of 0-100 μgl(-1) (r(2)=0.9990 and r(2)=0.9995 respectively). The lowest measurable mercury was 0.4 μgl(-1) which corresponds to 0.01 μgg(-1) in fish tissues and sediments.

The decomposition of organic mercury species and the reduction of Hg(2+) could be completed in one step with this proposed SCGD induced vapor generation system. The vapor generation is extremely rapid and therefore is easy to couple with flow injection (FI) and HPLC. Compared with the conventional HPLC-CV-AFS hyphenated systems, the proposed HPLC-SCGD-AFS system is very simple in operation and eliminates auxiliary redox reagents. Parameters influencing mercury determination were optimized, such as concentration of formic acid, discharge current and argon flow rate.

While a number of studies have reported BPA concentrations in foods from foreign markets and specialty foods on the U.S. market, very few peer-reviewed data for the BPA concentrations in canned food from the U.S. market were available. This study quantified BPA concentrations in 78 canned and two frozen food products from the U.S. market using an adaptation of a previously reported liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The tested products represented 16 different food types that are from the can food classifications that constitute approximately 65% of U.S. canned food sales and canned food consumption. BPA was detected in 71 of the 78 canned food samples but was not detected in either of the two frozen food samples. Detectable BPA concentrations across all foods ranged from 2.6 to 730 ng/g. Large variations in BPA concentrations were found between different products of the same food type and between different lots of the same product. Given the large concentration ranges, the only distinguishable trend was that fruits and tuna showed the lowest BPA concentrations.

The official method for quantification of CO has a problem, in that a part of the CO is lost during the preparation of the fish sample. To solve this problem, we modified the official method in this study. We also applied this modified method to survey the contents of CO in tuna, yellowtail, young yellowtail, and tilapia. As a result, the modified method was found to be more suitable for CO quantification than the official method. An inter-laboratory study by 4 laboratories confirmed that the CO content of many samples of tilapia exceeded the regulation value, apparently due to the higher recovery of CO, compared to the official method. Therefore, it was suggested that the regulation value in the case of tilapia should be changed if this method is introduced as an official method.",Shokuhin eiseigaku zasshi.

In this study, we applied a reporter gene assay using DR-EcoScreen cells (DR-cell assay), which is highly sensitive to dioxins, to the determination of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in fish and seafood samples. The PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs were extracted from homogenated samples (10 g) of 30 fish and shellfish, purified by clean-up procedure using a multilayered silica gel column and an alumina column, and applied to DR-cell assay. Interestingly, the bioanalytical equivalent (BEQ) values obtained from the DR-cell assay [<0.1∼5.4 pg BEQ g(-1) wet weight (ww)] were closely correlated with the toxicity equivalent (TEQ) values from conventional high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC-HRMS) analysis (r(2)=0.912), and the slope of regression line was 0.913. Therefore, we multiplied the BEQ values from the DR-cell assay by a conversion coefficient (1.095, the reciprocal of 0.913) to approximate the TEQ values from the HRGC-HRMS analysis. Furthermore, we used this DR-cell assay to perform a prescreening test of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in 16 fish and seafood samples purchased from a supermarket, revealing that a sample from the fatty flesh of a bluefin tuna exceeded 8 pg TEQ g(-1)ww (the European Union-tolerance limit).

21122867,"The bottleneck of applying stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) to elemental speciation analysis is lack of suitable extraction phases with good affinities to different elemental species. In this paper, a newly high polar extraction phase of titania immobilized polypropylene hollow fiber (TiO₂-PPHF) was prepared by sol-gel immersion and low temperature hydrothermal process and the obtained TiO₂-PPHF inherits the adsorption properties of TiO₂ and the toughness of PPHF. With a suitable size of stainless steel magnetic bar inserted into the prepared TiO₂-PPHF, a disposable TiO₂-PPHF coating stir bar was obtained. The prepared TiO₂-PPHF was characterized by X-ray diffraction spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy and the significant parameters affecting the extraction efficiency of different arsenic species were studied. Based on the above facts, a new method of SBSE combined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was developed for the speciation of phenyl arsenic compounds and their possible transformation products in chicken tissues. Under the optimal conditions, limits of detection (LODs) of the developed method for eight target arsenic species were in the range of 11.4-64.6 ng L⁻¹ with enrichment factors of 8.5-22.3 (theory enrichment factor was 50), and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were varying from 6.3 to 12.6% (c(AsIII/V)=5 μg L⁻¹, c(MMA,DMA,p-ASA,4-OH,3-NHPAA,PA,4-NPAA)=10 μg L⁻¹, n=7). The proposed method was successfully applied to the speciation of arsenic in chicken meat/liver samples and the recoveries for the spiked samples were in the range of 78.5-120.4%. In order to validate the accuracy of the proposed method, a certified reference material of BCR-627 tuna fish tissue was analyzed and the determined values were in good agreement with the certified values.

20862733,"A robust and dependable headspace HS-GC-MS method has been developed for the determination of carbon monoxide (CO) treated tuna fish. The performance of the method has been evaluated by analyzing spiked and blank samples. The proposed method uses a programmed temperature vaporizing (PTV) injector to implement the HS injection and overcome the negative effects on the column of water contained in the sample. The level of CO could be easily detected in the treated samples, its amount differing markedly from that detected in the untreated samples. Proper oven temperature programming prevented any deterioration of chromatographic performance caused by the accumulation of water, carbon dioxide and other low molecular weight hydrocarbons in the column during serial analyses. The introduction of PTV injection and the restoring of GC column, by oven temperature programming, were crucial for obtaining the required robustness. This procedure assures the run-to-run repeatability necessary for high throughput applications. The method affords linear calibration curves ranging from 50 to 2500 ng/g of CO content in tuna sample.",Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,"['D000818', 'D002248', 'D005511', 'D008401', 'D016014', 'D015203', 'D017747', 'D013696', 'D014413']","['Animals', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Food Handling', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Linear Models', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Seafood', 'Temperature', 'Tuna']",High throughput headspace GC-MS quantitative method to measure the amount of carbon monoxide in treated tuna fish.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000295', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'instrumentation', None, None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20862733,2011
20738607,"The elements Na, Mg, Mn, Ca, Sr and Ba in otoliths of southern bluefin tuna Thunnus maccoyii, collected from their feeding ground in the central Indian Ocean and spawning ground between southern Java and north-western Australia were measured by laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) and compared among sampling locations and developmental stages. The Na, Mg and Mn to Ca concentration ratios were significantly higher at the larval stage than at the adult stage, and the ratio reached a peak at the first inflection point of the otolith, mean +/-s.d. 43.3 +/- 4.9 days after hatching and decreased sharply to a low level thereafter. The temporal change of the elements:Ca ratios in the first inflection point corresponded to the life stage transition from larva to juvenile, indicating that the uptake rate of elements from ambient waters was significantly influenced by the ontogenetic change in the fish. The elemental composition at the otolith edge differed significantly in sub-adults on the feeding grounds and adults on the spawning grounds. Thus, the otolith elemental composition can be used as a biological tracer to study the time of the ontogenetic shift and to reconstruct the past migratory environmental history of T. maccoyii. In addition, the elemental composition of the otolith core of the adult was similar between feeding and spawning grounds, indicating that the fish in the Indian Ocean had the same larval origin, which is consistent with the single spawning population hypothesis.",Journal of fish biology,"['D000818', 'D015415', 'D019156', 'D008386', 'D010037', 'D013997', 'D014413']","['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Indian Ocean', 'Marine Biology', 'Otolithic Membrane', 'Time Factors', 'Tuna']",Spatio-temporal variation in the elemental compositions of otoliths of southern bluefin tuna Thunnus maccoyii in the Indian Ocean and its ecological implication.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000254']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'growth & development']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20738607,2011

Due to the tendency of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to accumulate in exposed organisms, n-3 PUFA supplements can contain sufficient POPs to present a risk to consumers. Here we investigated PCB concentrations and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activity in 17 n-3 PUFA supplements available in Canada. PCBs ranged from <0.8 to 793 ng g(-1) oil, with salmon- and seal-derived products yielding the highest values. AhR agonist activity from a reporter gene assay ranged from 1.3 to 72.2 pg TEQ g(-1) oil, with salmon and tuna yielding the highest values. When consumed at the recommended doses and as a supplement to the average Canadian diet, seal-derived oil can contribute to exceedance of the tolerable daily intake of 20 ng PCBs kg-BW(-1)day(-1), and salmon-, tuna-, and sea herring-derived oils can contribute to exceedance of the tolerable daily intake limit of 2.3 pg TEQ kg-BW(-1)day(-1).

Sample preparation was performed using alkaline extraction and solid-phase-extraction cleanup. This evaluation was focused on both quantitative (sensitivity, precision, and accuracy) and qualitative (identification capabilities) aspects. In the three instruments, the former facet was evaluated using selected reaction monitoring (SRM), which is the standard mode for quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis. Accuracy was similar in the three systems, with recoveries always over 70 %. Precision was better for the QqLIT and QqQ systems (7-15%) than for the IT system (10-17%). The QqLIT (working in SRM mode) and QqQ systems offered a linear dynamic range of at least 3 orders of magnitude, whereas that of the IT system was 2 orders of magnitude. The QqLIT system achieved at least 20-fold higher sensitivity than the QqQ system, and this was at least tenfold higher sensitivity than for the IT system. In the IT system, identification was based on sensitive full mass range acquisition and MS( n ) fragmentation and in the QqLIT system, it was based on the use of an information-dependent-acquisition scan function, which allows the combination of an SRM or MS full scan acting as the survey scan and an enhanced product ion scan followed by MS(3) as the dependent scan in the same analysis.

Total mercury content in several biological samples was determined by FI-ICP-MS using a carrier solution consisting of 0.1% (v/v) HCl, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, to avoid memory effect, and 0.15% (w/v) KCl. For mercury speciation a RP18 chromatographic column coupled to ICP-MS was used. A mobile phase consisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 0.1% (v/v) HFBA, 2% (v/v) methanol, and 0.02% (w/v) mM L-cysteine at pH 2.1 was used for chromatographic separation of the mercury species in the sample extracts. Extraction procedures were validated by using 50 mg of tuna fish tissue CRM-463 (2.85+/-0.16 mg kg(-1) for methylmercury). The recoveries obtained were 99+/-3% and 93+/-1% after acid leaching (HCl 7 M) and enzymatic extraction (15 mg protease type XIV in 2.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), respectively. The optimal sonication conditions (5 min of exposure time and 40% of ultrasound amplitude) were applied to 5 mg of CRM-463 (88+/-5%), 5 mg of mussel tissue (81+/-11%) and to 2 mg of zebra fish embryos (90+/-10%) obtaining good recoveries in all cases. Methylmecury was found to be the most abundant Hg specie in all samples.

They have been well characterized in yeast, mammals, protists and bacteria but not yet in fish. Here we describe the cloning and functional characterization of a Prx 2 cDNA from southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii), an important aquaculture species in South Australia. The SBT Prx sequence was closely related (76-92% identical) to Prx 1 and 2 sequences from other fish and mammals and phylogenetic analyses showed that it was most likely a Prx 2. The deduced amino acid sequence contained the peroxidatic and resolving Cys residues characteristic of typical 2-Cys Prx proteins from all kingdoms of life. It also contained the GGLG motif associated with the sensitivity of eukaryotic typical 2-Cys Prx proteins to overoxidation and consequent inactivation by H2O2. When the SBT Prx 2 was expressed in E. coli, it showed thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent peroxidase activity with H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH) and t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-bOOH). The SBT Prx displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Trx but sigmoidal kinetics with H2O2 and CuOOH. The K(m)(Trx) was 12 microM and the S(0.5) values for H2O2 and CuOOH were 29 and 25 microM, respectively. At mM concentrations of H2O2, SBT Prx progressively lost its peroxidase activity as has been observed for other eukaryotic typical 2-Cys Prx proteins.

20192179,"This work demonstrates, for the first time, the applicability of multiple spiking isotope dilution analysis to molecular mass spectrometry exemplified by the speciation analysis of mercury using GC(EI)MS instrumentation. A double spike isotope dilution approach using isotopically enriched mercury isotopes has been applied for the determination of inorganic mercury Hg(II) and methylmercury (MeHg) in fish reference materials. The method is based on the application of isotope pattern deconvolution for the simultaneous determination of degradation-corrected concentrations of methylmercury and inorganic mercury. Mass isotopomer distributions are employed instead of isotope ratios to calculate the corrected concentrations of the Hg species as well as the extent of species degradation reactions. The isotope pattern deconvolution equations developed here allow the calculation of the different molar fractions directly from the GC(EI)MS mass isotopomer distribution pattern and take into account possible impurities present in the spike solutions employed. The procedure has been successfully validated with the analysis of two different certified reference materials (BCR-464 and DOLT-4) and with the comparison of the results obtained by GC(ICP)MS. For the tuna fish matrix (BCR-464), no interconversion reactions were observed at the optimized conditions of open focused microwave extraction at 70 degrees C during 8 min. However, significant demethylation was found under the same conditions in the case of the certified dogfish liver DOLT-4. Methylation and demethylation factors were confirmed by GC(ICP)MS. Transformation reactions have been found to depend on the sample matrix and on the derivatization reagent employed. Thus, it is not possible to recommend optimum extraction conditions suitable for all types of matrices demonstrating the need to apply multiple spiking methodologies for the determination of MeHg and Hg(II) in biological samples. Double spike isotope dilution analysis methodologies using widespread GC(EI)MS instrumentation are proposed here for the routine analysis of inorganic mercury and methylmercury in fish samples.

20188947,"A simple and efficient method for the determination of ultra-trace amounts of inorganic mercury (iHg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in waters and fish tissues was developed using a micro-column filled with polyaniline (PANI) coupled online to flow injection-chemical vapour generation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (FI-CVG-ICPMS) system. Preliminary studies indicated that inorganic and methyl mercury species could be separated on PANI column in two different speciation approaches. At pH <3, only iHg could be sorbed and almost no adsorption of MeHg was found (speciation procedure 1). If the sample solution pH is approximately 7, both MeHg and iHg species could be sorbed on the PANI column. Subsequently both the Hg species were selectively eluted with 2% HCl and a mixture of 2% HCl and 0.02% thiourea respectively (speciation procedure 2). The adsorption percentage of iHg on the PANI column was unchanged even with acidity of the sample solution increased to 6 mol L(-1). Therefore, an acidic solution (5 mol L(-1) HCl), used for ultra-sound assisted extraction of the mercury species from biological samples, was used directly to separate MeHg from iHg in the fish tissues (tuna fish ERM-CE 463, ERM-CE 464 and IAEA-350) by PANI column using speciation procedure 1. The determined values were in good agreement with certified values. Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) were 2.52 pg and 3.24 pg for iHg and MeHg (as Hg) respectively. The developed method was applied successfully to the direct determination of iHg and MeHg in various waters (tap water, lake water, ground water and sea-water) and the recoveries for the spiked samples were in the range of 96-102% for both the Hg species.",Talanta,"['D053000', 'D000814', 'D000818', 'D002021', 'D005591', 'D005399', 'D017022', 'D006851', 'D006863', 'D007202', 'D013058', 'D008628', 'D008767', 'D009862', 'D014413', 'D014465', 'D014835', 'D014867']","['Analytic Sample Preparation Methods', 'Aniline Compounds', 'Animals', 'Buffers', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Fishes', 'Flow Injection Analysis', 'Hydrochloric Acid', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mercury', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Online Systems', 'Tuna', 'Ultrasonics', 'Volatilization', 'Water']",On-line speciation of inorganic and methyl mercury in waters and fish tissues using polyaniline micro-column and flow injection-chemical vapour generation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (FI-CVG-ICPMS).,"[None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20188947,2010

Although water-soluble compounds have been well characterized, the fat-soluble compounds, so-called arsenolipids, have until recently remained unknown. We report that sashimi-grade tuna fish, with a total arsenic content of 5.9 microg of As/g dry mass, contains approximately equal quantities of water- and fat-soluble arsenic. The water-soluble arsenic comprised predominantly arsenobetaine (>95%) with a trace of dimethylarsinate. Two fat-soluble compounds, which together accounted for about 40% of the lipid-arsenic, were isolated and characterized. The first was identified as 1-dimethylarsinoylpentadecane [(CH(3))(2)As(O)(CH(2))(14)CH(3)] by comparison of HPLC/mass spectrometric data and accurate mass data with those of an authenticated synthesized standard. The second arsenolipid was postulated as 1-dimethylarsinoyl all-cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexane from mass spectrometric data and analogy with non-arsenic-containing lipids found in fish.

We have analyzed and characterized the lipids of eggs and unfed larvae of two wild caught scombroid fish, the Atlantic northern bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda). Dry matter and total lipid contents, polar and neutral lipid classes and total lipid fatty acid contents were determined in the eggs of bluefin tuna and eggs and unfed larvae during the development of Atlantic bonito. Bluefin tuna eggs had slightly but significantly more dry mass than bonito eggs but very similar lipid content. However, bluefin tuna eggs presented a higher polar lipid content due to increased proportions of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Bonito eggs and larvae showed increasing dry mass and decreasing lipid content with development. The proportion of polar lipids increased due to increased PE, PS and PI, whereas choline-containing polar lipids (phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) remained relatively constant. Free cholesterol also increased, whereas the levels of other neutral lipids, especially triacylglycerol and steryl ester fractions, decreased, presumably due to utilization for energy to drive development. Bluefin tuna eggs had higher levels of n - 3 and n - 6 highly unsaturated fatty acids due to higher docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acid contents, respectively, than bonito eggs.

Foods included fish (sardine, hake, and tuna), meat (veal steak, loin of pork, breast and thigh of chicken, and steak and rib of lamb), string bean, potato, rice, and olive oil. For each food item, two composite samples were prepared for metal analyses, whose levels in raw and cooked (fried, grilled, roasted, and boiled) samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The highest concentrations of As, Hg, and Pb (raw and cooked samples) were mainly found in fish, with a clear tendency, in general, to increase metal concentrations after cooking. However, in these samples, Cd levels were very close to their detection limit. In turn, the concentrations of metals in raw and cooked meat samples were detected in all samples (As) or only in a very few samples (Cd, Hg, and Pb). A similar finding corresponded to string beans, rice, and olive oil, while in potatoes, Hg could not be detected and Pb only was detected in the raw samples. In summary, the results of the present study show that, in general terms, the cooking process is only of a very limited value as a means of reducing metal concentrations. This hypothetical reduction depends upon cooking conditions (time, temperature, and medium of cooking).",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D001151', 'D002645', 'D005399', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D008460', 'D019216', 'D012756', 'D013552', 'D014675']","['Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Chickens', 'Fishes', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Meat', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Sheep', 'Swine', 'Vegetables']","Effects of various cooking processes on the concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead in foods.","[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18986150,2009

18822416,"An improved sensitive method was developed and validated for the determination of histamine in food samples by using automated on-line pre-column derivatization coupled with high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). o-Phthaldialdehyde (OPA) was adopted as derivatization reagent, and a ""sandwich"" (OPA+histamine+OPA) aspiration mode for the automated on-line pre-column derivatization was found to efficiently enhance the method sensitivity and precision. Histamine in food samples was efficiently extracted with a methanol-phosphate buffer solution (50:50, v/v) at 60 degrees C for 30 min, and purified with Waters Oasis MCX solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. The limit of quantification for this method is 0.2 mg/kg, which is very sensitive for histamine determination. With the ""sandwich"" injection program, 3.7% of relative standard deviation (RSD) was achieved by five replicative determinations of a sample blank spiked with 0.25 mg/kg histamine standard. Histamine in food samples such as fumitory skipjack and mackerel was analyzed with relative recoveries over 95% at spiking level of 150 mg/kg, as well as canned tuna fish and cheese with relative recoveries up to 98% at spiking levels of 0.50 and 5.0 mg/kg, respectively.

18640714,"Otoliths are calcified structures in the head of fish that record environmental information about fish's life history. Gathering the elemental information from the core of an otolith corresponding to the juvenile period of fish's life is critical to discriminate the adult fish to their natal habitats reliably. A high resolution micromill has been used to isolate the otolith core from a whole otolith for elemental analysis. The effects of micromilling procedures (e.g., sectioning, embedding and drilling) on contamination to otolith trace element levels were examined using paired blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus) otoliths. Otoliths were decontaminated by dilute hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid throughout to remove surface contamination. A preconcentration procedure was used to determine the trace elements from the small core material by ICP-MS. It was found that micromilling procedures introduce significant contamination to otoliths, especially for Al, Cu, Pb and Zn. The sectioning procedure caused significant contamination for Co and Cu, while the embedding procedure resulted in contamination for nearly all trace elements (Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Ga, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn). The combined sectioning, embedding and drilling procedure also resulted in contamination for most trace elements. Despite the contamination across all procedural steps, the decontamination procedure effectively removed the surface contamination with the exception of Pb and Zn. Bias (e.g., residual contamination) on Pb was small in comparison to overall concentration of Pb expected to occur in fish otoliths, therefore, its effect may be minor in discriminating individuals. Bias on Zn was larger that could limit its application in discriminating individuals.",Marine environmental research,"['D000818', 'D013058', 'D008867', 'D010037', 'D016613', 'D014131', 'D014413']","['Animals', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microtomy', 'Otolithic Membrane', 'Plastic Embedding', 'Trace Elements', 'Tuna']",High resolution micromill sampling for analysis of fish otoliths by ICP-MS: effects of sampling and specimen preparation on trace element fingerprints.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18640714,2008
18407622,"This work presents the simultaneous online determination of the isotopic composition of different Hg species in a single sample by the hyphenation of gas chromatography (GC) with multicollector-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). With the use of commercially available instrumentation, precise and accurate species-specific Hg isotope delta values (per mil deviation of the Hg isotope ratio in the sample relative to a reference standard) have been obtained online from consecutive GC transient signals. The use of isothermal temperature programs to extend the elution of the Hg species, the proper selection of the peak integration window, as well as the preconcentration of real samples are critical to provide optimal counting statistics. Also, isotope ratio drift during transient signal elution was overcome by introducing a mixed Hg(II) and MeHg standard bracketing scheme and expressing all results using the delta-notation relative to SRM NIST-3133. Using the proposed methodology, we have obtained an external 2SD precision of 0.56 per thousand for delta (202)Hg that is more than 10 times smaller than the overall Hg stable isotope variation thus far observed in terrestrial samples. The measurement of species-specific Hg isotopic composition relative to SRM NIST-3133 has been validated versus two other analytical techniques, i.e., conventional nebulization (CN) of Hg(II) solution and cold vapor (CV) generation of Hg (0) vapor. A good agreement between the species-specific delta values obtained by the different techniques has been obtained in secondary fractionated reference standard (UM-Almaden) and environmental matrixes, i.e., BCR-CRM 464 (tuna fish) and IAEA-085 (human hair). The results show mass-dependent and mass-independent fractionation in environmental samples, i.e., mass-independent fractionation of odd isotopes (199)Hg and (201)Hg in tuna fish was observed.

Because carbon stable isotope values are influenced by tissue lipid content, a number of extraction methods have been used to remove lipid bias, but, in some species and tissues, extractions also alter nitrogen isotope values. We have analyzed delta(13)C and delta(15)N in Atlantic bluefin tuna liver and white muscle, and whole Atlantic herring, fish tissues covering a wide range of lipid content (bulk C:N 3.1-12.5). In order to compare delta(13)C and delta(15)N values from traditional chloroform/methanol extractions with non-polar solvent alternatives, we analyzed samples following (1) no treatment, (2) lipid removal using chloroform/methanol (2:1), and (3) Soxhlet extractions using chloroform, diethyl ether or hexane. Chloroform/methanol and chloroform extractions produced the lowest C:N values and highest delta(13)C values. In bluefin tuna, chloroform and hexane extractions significantly altered liver delta(15)N, and all methods significantly altered delta(15)N values in white muscle. Whole Atlantic herring delta(15)N was not altered by any extraction method, while the 2:1 chloroform/methanol extraction most completely removed fish tissue lipid components. Our results indicate that delta(15)N effects are not limited to common chloroform/methanol extractions and suggest that chloroform/methanol is the most effective extraction for delta(13)C correction.

Speciated isotope dilution mass spectrometry (SIDMS; US Environmental Protection Agency's method 6800) was utilized to evaluate and effectively compensate for potential errors during measurement and accurately quantify mercury species using all the extraction methods. SIDMS was used to accurately evaluate species transformations during sample pretreatment, preparation and analysis protocols. The extraction methods tested in this paper were based on alkaline extraction with KOH or tetramethylammonium hydroxide; acid leaching with HCl, HNO(3) or CH(3)COOH; extraction with L: -cysteine hydrochloride; and enzymatic digestion with protease XIV. Detection of total mercury and mercury species from all extraction methods was carried out by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography-ICP-MS, respectively. Microwave-assisted extraction and ultrasound-assisted extraction were found to be the most efficient alkaline digestion protocols that caused the lowest levels of transformation of mercury species (6% or less). Extraction with 5 M HCl or enzymatic digestion with protease resulted in the second-highest extraction efficiency, with relatively lower transformation of methylmercury to inorganic mercury (3 and 1.4%, respectively). Despite frequent use of acid leaching for the extraction of mercury species from tuna fish samples, the lowest extraction efficiencies and the highest mercury species transformation were obtained when microwave-assisted extraction with 4 M HNO(3) or CH(3)COOH was used. Transformations as high as 30% were found using some literature protocols; however, all the extractions tested produced accurate quantitation when corrected in accordance with the SIDMS method standardized in the US Environmental Protection Agency's method 6800.

Owing to volatilization, concentrations of lower-chlorinated PCBs were reduced to below the limit of quantification after smoking. DL-PCBs contributed 61-97% to the total TEQ in all eel samples. This also holds for other fish and shellfish (except shrimps): DL-PCB contributed (on average) from 53 (herring) to 83% (tuna) to the total TEQ. Principal-component analysis revealed distinctive congener profiles for PCDD/Fs and non-ortho PCBs for mussels, pikeperch, herring and various Mediterranean fish. The application of new TCDD toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) set by the World Health Organization in 2006 (to replace the 1997 TEFs) resulted in lower TEQ values, mainly owing to a decreased mono-ortho PCB contribution. This decrease is most pronounced for eel, owing to the relative high mono-ortho PCB concentrations in eel. Consequently, a larger number of samples would comply with the MRLs when the new TEFs are applied. The DR CALUX(R) assay may be used for screening total TEQ levels in eel, in combination with gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry confirmation of suspected samples. An almost 1:1 correlation was found when the 1997 TEFs were applied, but, surprisingly, a 1.4-fold overestimation occurred with application of the 2006 TEFs.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D001572', 'D001681', 'D001713', 'D004147', 'D005399', 'D005504', 'D006843', 'D009426', 'D012758', 'D012907', 'D013997', 'D014944']","['Animals', 'Benzofurans', 'Biological Assay', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Dioxins', 'Fishes', 'Food Analysis', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated', 'Netherlands', 'Shellfish', 'Smoking', 'Time Factors', 'World Health Organization']","Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans and biphenyls in fish from the Netherlands: concentrations, profiles and comparison with DR CALUX bioassay results.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17565487,2007
17383668,"A simple, fast, and accurate method for the simultaneous determination of methylmercury (MeHg(+)), monobutyltin (MBT), dibutyltin (DBT) and tributyltin (TBT) in seafood is proposed. The method makes use of relatively cheap instrumentation and allows simultaneous analysis of those four species in a routine basis. The sample is treated with methanolic potassium hydroxide in an ultrasound bath, derivatised with sodium tetraethylborate (NaBEt(4)), preconcentrated into n-hexane and analysed by gas chromatography with atomic emission detection (GC-MIP/AES). The soft extraction conditions provided by ultrasound energy prevent chemical decomposition of the analytes and allow fast and efficient recovery of the species considered. Both the extraction and the derivatisation/preconcentration steps were optimised. Detection limits of 34, 3, 6 and 8 ng g(-1) (dry mass) were obtained for MeHg(+), MBT, DBT and TBT, respectively, using the best experimental conditions found. The uncertainty of the analysis ranged from 11% (MeHg(+)) to 15% (MBT). The accuracy of the method was checked by the analysis of several certified reference materials, e.g., BCR 477 (mussel tissue, MBT, DBT and TBT), DOLT-2 (dogfish liver, MeHg(+)), BCR 463 (tuna fish, MeHg(+)) and NIST 2976 (mussel tissue, MeHg(+)) with satisfactory results. Several oyster samples collected in the estuary of the Oka River (Urdaibai, Unesco Reserve of the Biosphere, Basque Country) during four sampling campaigns in 2003-2004 were processed following the proposed procedure.

Some geographic areas are potentially more threatened than others: one of these is the Mediterranean Sea. Levels of some xenobiotics are much higher here than in other seas and oceans. In this paper we review the final results of a project supported by the Italian Ministry of the Environment, in which the hypothesis that Mediterranean top predator species (such as large pelagic fish and marine mammals) are potentially at risk due to EDCs was investigated. We illustrate the need to develop and apply sensitive methodological tools, such as biomarkers (Vitellogenin, Zona Radiata proteins and CYP1A activities) for evaluation of toxicological risk in large pelagic fish top predators (Swordfish, (Xiphias gladius), Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus thynnus thynnus)) and nondestructive biomarkers (CYP1A activities and fibroblast cell culture in skin biopsy), for the hazard assessment of threatened marine mammals species (Striped Dolphin, (Stenella coeruleoalba), Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), Common Dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus))exposed to EDCs.

Analytical results were validated by spiking the samples with various concentrations of these metals for recovery. The metal contents, expressed in microg/g, wet weight, varied depending upon the specie studied. The levels of Pb ranged from 0.03-1.20 microg-g(-1) with an average of 0.313 microg-g(-1) for salmon; 0.03-0.51 microg-g(-1) with an average of 0.233 microg-g(-1) for tuna and 0.13-1.97 microg-g(-1) with an average of 0.835 microg-g(-1) for sardines.

16815532,"Media coverage has made the public aware of both the benefits and the risks from eating self-caught fish, but information on contaminants in commercial fish is much more limited, especially on a local level. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration website provides methylmercury data for a variety of fish, but for many species sample sizes are small and data are more than a decade old, whereas commercial fish sources are highly dynamic. A few state agencies are beginning to provide contaminant information for commercial fish, including canned tuna. We examined the mercury concentration of six types of fish purchased in supermarkets in Chicago, Illinois in 2005. We measured total mercury (methylmercury accounts for about 90% of the total mercury in fish). One key question was whether the concentrations of mercury in fish available locally were similar to those reported in other areas of the country and in the FDA U.S. national data base. Such information is critical for the public, especially pregnant women or those planning on pregnancy, making decisions about types and quantities of fish to consume. Some fish are available generally throughout the U.S., but others are more locally available, suggesting a need for site-specific information. This research was stakeholder driven, and reflected local interest in the safety of local fish. There were significant differences in mercury concentrations among the fish, ranging from a mean of 0.03 microg/g (ppm-wet weight) for salmon (Salmo spp.) to 1.41 ppm for swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Maximum values for three species of fish (orange roughy Hoplostethus atianticus, swordfish walleye Sander vitreus) were over 1 ppm (FDA action level), and all of the fish except salmon had some values above 0.5 ppm, the action level set by some states and countries. There were significant differences in mercury concentrations among three types of canned tuna (Thunnus spp): ""gourmet tuna"" had the least amount of mercury, and white tuna had the most. The mean concentrations reported in this study were generally similar to those reported by the FDA, but there were important differences: 1) although the mean mercury concentrations for orange roughy for the Chicago data was similar to the FDA data, the maximum concentration was higher; 2) the mean for the Chicago swordfish was higher than the FDA data (1.26 vs 0.97 ppm, methylmercury); 3) the maximum for tuna steaks was higher in the FDA data set; and, 4) mean values for grouper (Epinephelus spp.) were higher in the FDA data set than the Chicago data. Further, the FDA has virtually no data on walleye and none on ""gourmet tuna"".

The aim of this study is to determine heavy metal levels (Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn, Pb and Zn) in liver and muscle tissues of 14 Thunnus thynnus of different age and sex and to investigate the relationships between fish sex and size (length and weight) and metal concentrations in the tissues. The concentrations of the various metals were determined by a Varian atomic absorption spectroscopy instrument. The results show significant variations (p < 0.01) for Hg and Zn concentrations in muscle than in liver samples. Concentrations of Cd and Pb are below the instrumental detection limits in almost all muscle samples. Levels of Hg (3.03 +/- 0.55 microg/g) are above the MRLs only in muscle (1 microg/g) establishing toxicological risks for the consumer. Regression analysis shows a negative correlation between mercury level and weight and length in samples from both female and male. No significant difference between mean heavy metals concentrations and male or female tuna is seen.

In a previous work, ultrasonic probe has been proved to reduce sample treatment time for arsenic extraction in rice to only a few minutes. Base upon the obtained results, here several extraction media for chicken, fish and soil samples (SEAS G6RD-CT2001-00473) have been studied and evaluated employing the same technique. Chicken sample needed an enzymatic treatment in order to liberate the species linked to the protein matrix. Extraction of the major species in fish, AsB, was quantitatively achieved in water in 1 min. Also 1 min was enough to leach about 85% of species present in soils and sediments, mainly the inorganic ones, using H(3)PO(4). In all cases, no inter-conversion among As species was observed. The five species found in those samples were separated using an improved HPLC-ICP-MS method in only 11 min, with detection limits at the ng l(-1) level.

The method is based on the use of isotope dilution GC/MS with electron impact ionization, a widespread technique in routine testing laboratories. A certified spike containing (202)Hg-enriched methylmercury was used for the isotope dilution of the samples. After extraction of the methylmercury from the sample, methylmercury was propylated using sodium tetrapropyl borate in SPME vials and the analytes were sampled from the headspace for 15 min. For isotope measurements, the molecular ion (MePrHg(+)) was used in the SIM mode. Five molecular ions were monitored, corresponding to the (198)Hg, (199)Hg, (200)Hg, (201)Hg and (202)Hg isotopes. The detection at masses corresponding to (198)Hg was used to correct for m + 1 contributions of (13)C from the organic groups attached to the mercury atom on the (199)Hg, (200)Hg, (201)Hg and (202)Hg masses with simple mathematical equations, and the concentration of methylmercury was calculated on the basis of the corrected (200)Hg/(202)Hg isotope ratio. The (202)Hg-enriched methylmercury spike was applied, with satisfactory results, to the determination of methylmercury in the certified reference material BCR 464.

The method is also a useful screen for histamine (HTA). The method involves homogenization of fish tissue, extraction of biogenic amines into borate-trichloroacetic acid solution, centrifugation, and derivatization of supernatant with 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester. The derivatized diamine species allow for the intramolecular excimer fluorescence of the pyrene moiety at a higher emission wavelength than is possible for the endogenous tissue monoamines, thus providing visual specificity of detection. All seafood species were fortified with 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 microg/g (ppm) of PUT and CAD. Determination was based on standard graphs for PUT and CAD using peak areas with standard solutions equivalent to 0.375, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 ppm in tissue. A set of five matrix controls (unfortified seafood tissue) were also analyzed; endogenous PUT was found in all samples except the canned tuna, and CAD found only in the shrimp, crab, and cold-smoked salmon.

Analyses of BPA were performed by RP-HPLC with fluorescence detection. Four migration experiments, performed between 2000 and 2003, using cans with organosol, epoxy and a combination of both types of coatings were performed under different processing conditions and storage times. Migration levels as high as 646.5 microg kg(-1) BPA from an organosol coating of tuna fish cans were found using a fatty-food simulant following the heat processing of the simulant-filled cans. Levels ranging from 11.3 to 138.4 microg kg(-1) BPA from tuna cans coated with an epoxy resin migrated to the fatty-food simulant during 1 year at 25 degrees C. Levels of BPA migration into a fatty-food simulant from thermally processed and stored tuna cans coated with a combination of organosol and epoxy resins and from vegetable cans coated with an epoxy resin were below the limit of quantitation of 10.0 microg kg(-1). Migration of BPA to tuna ranged from <7.1 to 105.4 microg kg(-1) during long-term storage at 25 degrees C.

The method was validated by three biological reference materials (CRM 477, mussel tissue certified for butyltins; CRM 463, tuna fish certified for MeHg+; DORM 2, dogfish muscle certified for MeHg+). Under certain conditions, and with minor modifications of the sample pretreatment procedure, this method could also be transferred to environmental samples such as sediments, as demonstrated by analyzing sediment reference material BCR 646 (freshwater sediment, certified for butyltins). The detection limits of the multi-species GC-ICP-IDMS method for biological samples were 1.4 ng g(-1) for MeHg+, 0.06 ng g(-1) for Me3Pb+, 0.3 ng g(-1) for BuSn3+ and Bu3Sn+, and 1.2 ng g(-1) for Bu2Sn2+. Because of the high relevance of these heavy metal alkyl species to the quality assurance of seafood, the method was also applied to corresponding samples purchased from a supermarket. The methylated lead fraction in these samples, correlated to total lead, varied over a broad range (from 0.01% to 7.6%). On the other hand, the MeHg+ fraction was much higher, normally in the range of 80-100%. Considering that we may expect tighter legislative limitations on MeHg+ levels in seafood in the future, we found the highest methylmercury contents (up to 10.6 microg g(-1)) in two shark samples, an animal which is at the end of the marine food chain, whereas MeHg+ contents of less than 0.2 microg g(-1) were found in most other seafood samples; these results correlate with the idea that MeHg+ is usually of biological origin in the marine environment. The concentration of butyltins and the fraction of the total tin content that is from butyltins strongly depend on possible contamination, due to the exclusively anthropogenic character of these compounds. A broad variation in the butylated tin fraction (in the range of <0.3-49%) was therefore observed in different seafood samples. Corresponding isotope-labeled spike compounds (except for trimethyllead) are commercially available for all of these compounds, and since these can be used in the multi-species species-specific GC-ICP-IDMS method developed here, this technique shows great potential for routine analysis in the future.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D049872', 'D002849', 'D005399', 'D008401', 'D008767', 'D011865', 'D012680', 'D013045', 'D013756', 'D014018', 'D014220']","['Animals', 'Bivalvia', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Fishes', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Radioisotope Dilution Technique', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Species Specificity', 'Tetraethyl Lead', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Trialkyltin Compounds']","Simultaneous multi-species determination of trimethyllead, monomethylmercury and three butyltin compounds by species-specific isotope dilution GC-ICP-MS in biological samples.","[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000097', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000031', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'blood', 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16136305,2006

The predominantly used ICPMS detection online with HPLC only provides element-selective information, which is not sufficient for the identification of arsenic species without standards. However, electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode enables molecule-selective detection with high sensitivity for quantification. A new HPLC-ES-SRM method was developed for the determination of more than 20 organoarsenic species. Two chromatographic systems were compared, an anion exchange method and a combined cation anion exchange method. Collision-induced dissociation breakdown curves were constructed for all arsenic species investigated and used to optimize the SRM conditions. External calibration was performed with mixed standard solutions containing 21 arsenic species. Two SRM transitions were monitored for most of the analytes, and their intensity ratio was used for quality control. The developed methods were applied for the quantification of arsenic species in extracts of four marine reference materials. Spiking experiments revealed, especially for the early-eluting analytes on the anion exchange system, significant signal suppression by coeluting matrix constituents. Therefore, the standard addition approach was used for quantification.

15990151,"A home-modified atomic fluorescence detector (mAFS) has been employed for mercury and methylmercury determination in bivalves from the Andalusian coast (south Spain). This modification consists on the inclusion of a quartz flow cell into the detector, which increases the concentration of mercury atoms in the detector and therefore enhances sensitivity about two fold. Two analytical approaches for mercury speciation based on the coupling of gas chromatography on-line pyrolysis and mAFS (GC-Pyro-mAFS) have been tested. The first approach (Method 1) is based on aqueous ethylation followed by extraction into an organic solvent, and the second one (Method 2) in the extraction of monoalkylated mercury as chloride. Method 1 is a rapid procedure but not sensitive enough for the analysis of methylmercury in non-polluted sites (detection limit: 20 ng g(-1) as mercury, wet basis). The second one is quite more sensitive (detection limit: 0.2 ng g(-1), wet weight), but sample treatment is cumbersome and time-consuming. The optimum range for mercury determination for both methods are complementary and exhibit an overlapping measurable concentration range (OMCR) in which methylmercury can be indistinctly determined (75-100 ng g(-1) as mercury, wet basis). The suitability of both methods has been assayed with spiking experiences at levels within the OMCR with good recoveries. Both approaches have been validated with two certified reference materials (BCR-463, mercury and methylmercury in tuna fish; and NIST-2977, organic contaminants and trace metals in mussel tissue).

Eighty different canned foods purchased from retail outlets in Christchurch, New Zealand, between November 2003 and February 2004 were analysed for BPA concentration by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. BPA was detected in all foods analysed except for soft drinks. Concentrations ranged from < 10 to 29 microg kg(-1), except for individual samples of tuna, corned beef and coconut cream, which were 109, 98 and 191 microg kg(-1) , respectively. The limit of quantitation was <10 microg kg(-1) for foods of low fat content (< 1%) and <20 microg kg(-1) for foods containing >1% fat. Mean concentration data were combined with 24-h dietary recall information for 4399 individual consumers. Mean and maximum exposures were 0.008 and 0.29 microg kg(-1) bw day(-1), respectively, well below the temporary tolerable daily intake of 10 microg kg(-1) bw day(-1) given by the European Commission in 2002. The results of the present survey suggest that the levels of BPA identified in canned foods are unlikely to be of concern to adult health, and there is no reason for consumers to change their consumption patterns as a result of these findings.

Atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (AFS) was applied in a cold vapor mode for total mercury quantification and was also hyphenated to gas chromatography (GC) to achieve the speciation of organomercurial species in fish samples. The results obtained show the highest concentration of Hg in swordfish and tuna (0.47+/-0.02 and 0.31+/-0.01 microg g-1, respectively), and a much lower concentration in sardine, mackerel shad, and octopus (0.048+/-0.002, 0.033+/-0.001, and 0.024+/-0.001 microg g-1, respectively). The determination of alkyl mercury compounds revealed that 93-98% of mercury in the fish samples was in the organic form. Methylmercury (MeHg) was the only species found in the three fish species with higher mercury content.

15579559,"The eye lenses of the Antarctic nototheniid fishes that inhabit the perennially freezing Antarctic seawater are transparent at -2 degrees C, whereas the cold-sensitive mammalian and tropical fish lenses display cold-induced cataract at 20 degrees C and 7 degrees C, respectively. No cold-cataract occurs in the giant Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni lens when cooled to temperatures as low as -12 degrees C, indicating highly cold-stable lens proteins. To investigate this cold stability, we characterised the lens crystallin proteins of the Antarctic toothfish, in parallel with those of the sub-tropical bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus and the endothermic cow Bos taurus, representing three disparate thermal climes (-2 degrees C, 18 degrees C and 37 degrees C, respectively). Sizing chromatography resolved their lens crystallins into three groups, alpha/betaH, beta and gamma, with gamma crystallins being the most abundant (>40%) lens proteins in fish, in contrast to the cow lens where they comprise only 19%. The upper thermal stability of these crystallin components correlated with the body temperature of the species. In vitro chaperone assays showed that fish alpha crystallin can protect same-species gamma crystallins from heat denaturation, as well as lysozyme from DTT-induced unfolding, and therefore are small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSP) like their mammalian counterparts. Dynamic light scattering measured an increase in size of alphagamma crystallin mixtures upon heating, which supports formation of the alphagamma complex as an integral part of the chaperone process. Surprisingly, in cross-species chaperone assays, tuna alpha crystallins only partly protected toothfish gamma crystallins, while cow alpha crystallins completely failed to protect, indicating partial and no alphagamma interaction, respectively. Toothfish gamma was likely to be the component that failed to interact, as the supernatant from a cow alpha plus toothfish gamma incubation could chaperone cow gamma crystallins in a subsequent heat incubation, indicating the presence of uncomplexed cow alpha. This suggests that the inability of toothfish gamma crystallins to fully complex with tuna alpha, and not at all with the cow alpha crystallins, may have its basis in adaptive changes in the protein that relate to the extreme cold-stability of the toothfish lens.",The Journal of experimental biology,"['D000064', 'D000818', 'D000864', 'D002417', 'D002850', 'D003080', 'D004591', 'D006360', 'D015151', 'D007908', 'D018832', 'D010473', 'D013045', 'D038201']","['Acclimatization', 'Animals', 'Antarctic Regions', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cold Temperature', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lens, Crystalline', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Perciformes', 'Species Specificity', 'alpha-Crystallins']",Cold-stable eye lens crystallins of the Antarctic nototheniid toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni Norman.,"['Q000502', None, None, 'Q000502', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737']","['physiology', None, None, 'physiology', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'physiology', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15579559,2005

One of the main sources of essential FA are the marine products; the tuna is a marine food of wide consumption in Mexico due its readiness and low cost. The objective of this work was to determine the profile of fatty acids (FA) in tuna canned in oil and in water coming from three fishing areas of the Mexican Pacific. There were randomly obtained 7 oil-tuna commercial marks (AA) and 5 water- tuna (AW) coming from the next fishery areas: Baja California Sur (L1), Colima (L2) and Mazatlán (L3). The samples without draining were liquefied and thereafter it was obtained the methyl esters of fatty acids that were analyzed by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. In all the areas were identified 20 FA (mg/100 g); three AG omega 3 (EPA, DHA and linolenic) and two omega 6 (linoleic and arachidonic). In the AA of the three areas the most abundant saturated FA were estearric and palmitic acids, the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid was the cis-vaccenic, followed by the oleic acid. The behavior of those omega 3 in the AA of the three areas were similar: with the less quantity was the linolenic acid (447-755), continued by the EPA (979-1323) and finally high concentrations of DHA (1862-3327). In the AW the DHA was the most abundant fatty acid in all the areas (1086-4456), the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid was the palmitic (640-3809). It was observed the presence of trans fatty acids in high quantities in AW: linolelaidic (1394-1495) and elaidic (377-1234). The relationship omega 3/omega 6 in the AA was similar in L1 and L2, and lower in L3; in AW was higher in L2 and L3. In conclusion, evident variation exists in the content of FA among areas; it could be considered that the AA of L3 and AW of L2 as the richest in omega-3 and omega-6 FA.

Otoliths dissolved in acid solutions contain high concentrations of calcium and a variety of proteins. Elimination of matrix salts and organic interferences during preconcentration is essential for accurate determination of trace elements in otolith solutions by inductively coupled plasma-quadrupole mass spectrometry. An iminodiacetate-based chelating resin (Toyopearl AF-Chelate 650 M) has been used for on-line preconcentration and matrix separation for the determination of 31 transition and rare elements. Successful preconcentration of the elements was achieved at pH 5 by on-line buffering, except Mn which required pH 8.8. Sample solutions were loaded on to the column for 1 min at 3.2 mL min(-1), and then eluted directly into the mass spectrometer with 4% v/v nitric acid. This procedure enabled up to 25-fold preconcentration with successful removal of the calcium matrix. The effect of heat-assisted oxidation with concentrated nitric acid was investigated to eliminate the organic matrix. It was found that heating to dryness after dissolution and further mineralization with the acid significantly improved the retention of the transition elements.

Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for each congener in each food were reported. Point estimates of exposure were calculated using a 3-day (1-day diary plus 2-day recall) food consumption survey for eaters-only and for the general population (USDA/CSFII, 1989-92). Toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) were used to derive overall dioxin/furan toxicity equivalents (TEQ) for each sample food. Mean estimates of TEQ exposure for each food were derived using five values for non-detects (ND = 0; ND = 1/2 LOD or LOQ, ND = LOD or LOQ) on both a total sample and eaters-only basis. Using zero and the LOD provide lower and upper bounds on the range of estimated exposure, respectively. The bounds on mean dioxin intakes (pg/person/day) calculated for consumers of specific foods were estimated as follows (using zero or LOD for non-detects): butter (0.5-11), cheese (1.6-3.2), ice cream (4-19), yogurt (0.8-28), catfish (148-150), fish (other than catfish) (0.03-9), crustacea (32-35), mollusks (16.1-16.6), and shrimp (0.09-4.5). Exposure estimates derived by the five ND-methods are strongly dependent on the LOD and LOQ and represent upper bound estimates of exposure. Uncertainty in the exposure estimates is reduced with refinements in the analytical method.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000293', 'D000328', 'D000367', 'D000368', 'D000818', 'D002397', 'D002648', 'D002675', 'D003611', 'D004147', 'D004435', 'D005260', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D005663', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D008297', 'D008875', 'D012737']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Catfishes', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dairy Products', 'Dioxins', 'Eating', 'Female', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors']",Exposure assessment of dioxins/furans consumed in dairy foods and fish.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000008', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11358181,2001

The approximate chemical analysis was carried out by the methods of AOAC; minerals (Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr an Pb) by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and vitamins by HPLC. The percentage of moisture was among 65-75%, crude protein (12.6-16.4%) and ether extract, the fraction with most variation among locations, was (7.1-15.9%). Niacin was the most abundant vitamin (4.8-16.5 mg/100 g); mean Vitamin A (UI/100 g) in L1 and L2 was similar (36.5 and 36.2), and higher in L3 (42.0). The most abundant minerals were Na (136-552 mg/100 g) and K (78-221 mg/100 g), from this, the widest range of Na and K were found in L1, while L2 was for P. Ca (mg/100 g) showed different mean values between L1 (6.9) and L2 (12.7) and in L3 the range was extensive (3.4-21.8). Zn was low in L2 (0.2-0.4 mg/100 g) and higher in L3 (0.54-0.70 mg/100 g).

Rainbow trout IGF-I was further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with anti-recombinant coho salmon IGF-I (rsIGF-I) serum and HPLC on a reverse-phase C18 column. During purification, trout IGF-I was monitored by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting with anti-IGF-I-serum, homologous radioimmunoassay (RIA) for salmon IGF-I, and sulfation bioassay. The trout IGF-I appeared on SDS-PAGE as a single band with a molecular weight of 7 kDa, the same size as rsIGF-I. The partial N-terminal amino acid sequence (residues 1-20) was identical to the predicted mature trout IGF-I cDNA sequence.

8224328,"The present paper describes a quick and simple enzymic method for evaluating histamine content in fish. After preparing a perchloric acid extract, it was neutralized to pH 6.8 with KOH. The action of a diamine oxidase on the histamine caused the formation of hydrogen peroxide. The addition of a second enzyme, a peroxidase, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and a chromogen (leuco crystal violet) in reduced form (colourless) facilitated its oxidation into crystal violet (coloured). Following a two-hour incubation period, absorbance was measured at 596 nm. The correlation between histamine level and absorbance was acceptable in the concentration range from 3 to 30 mg/kg of histamine (r = 0.9946; p < 0.001). The accuracy of the method, expressed by CV, varied between 2.6% and 4.9%, and the recovery between 95.7% and 100.1%, depending on the concentration of analyte in the sample. The diamine oxidase used was very selective in relation to the histamine. Only the presence of tyramine, when histamine concentration was low (< 10 mg/kg), tended to interfere to a slight degree in the technique.

3620111,"Some fish are warm-bodied, e.g. the bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), which has a muscle temperature 12-17 degrees C higher than its environment. This endothermy is achieved by aerobic metabolism and conserved by means of a heat-exchanger system. The hemoglobins of bluefin tuna are adapted to these conditions by their endothermic oxygenation, thus contributing to the preservation of the body energy. This is a new and so far unique property of tuna hemoglobin. The primary structure of the alpha and beta chains of bluefin tuna hemoglobins is presented. The sequence was determined after enzymatic and chemical cleavages of the chains and sequencing of the peptides in gas- and liquid-phase sequencers. The alpha chains consists of 143 residues and are N-terminally acetylated. The beta chains have 146 amino acids and show two ambiguities at positions 140 and 142.
