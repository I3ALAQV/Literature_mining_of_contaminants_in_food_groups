31126478,"A new method for extraction and determination of trace and ultratrace impurities from edible oils via an ultrasound-assisted extraction using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has been described. Method is simple and sensitive. Extraction variables like pH, concentrations of TMAH and EDTA, ultrasonication and centrifugation times were all optimised for analytes using engine-oil. Under optimised conditions, extraction of spiked analytes from all the edible oils into aqueous-medium were investigated and found to be quantitative (89-101%). Using this method, concentrations of impurities in edible-oils were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (GFAAS) using standard-addition calibration method and validated with microwave-digestion method. The method was successfully applied to edible oils extracted from various seeds such as mustard oil, sun flower oil, sesame oil, ground nut oil, coconut oil, rice bran oil and corn oil containing ultratrace impurities. Accuracy of developed method for edible-oils was checked with corresponding results obtained by microwave digestion method.",Food chemistry,"['D002104', 'D002857', 'D003300', 'D004492', 'D006108', 'D006863', 'D007854', 'D008345', 'D008872', 'D010938', 'D000644', 'D013010', 'D013054', 'D013696', 'D014131', 'D015032']","['Cadmium', 'Chromium', 'Copper', 'Edetic Acid', 'Graphite', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lead', 'Manganese', 'Microwaves', 'Plant Oils', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds', 'Sonication', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Temperature', 'Trace Elements', 'Zinc']","Ultrasound-assisted extraction of Pb, Cd, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn from edible oils with tetramethylammonium hydroxide and EDTA followed by determination using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126478,2019
22746294,"Roasting of high erucic mustard (HEM) seed has been reported to give a typical flavor and increase the oxidative stability of the extracted oil. A potent radical scavenging compound was successfully isolated from roasted HEM seed oil in a single-step chromatographic separation using an amino solid-phase extraction column. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry spectra revealed the compound as 2,6-dimethoxy-4-vinylphenol (generally known as canolol), and its identity was fully confirmed by chemical synthesis. The formation of canolol during roasting was compared among HEM varieties (Brassica juncea, B. juncea var. oriental, Brassica nigra, and Sinapis alba) together with a low erucic rapeseed variety. HEM varieties were shown to produce less than one-third of canolol compared to rapeseed at similar roasting conditions. This observation was linked to a lower free sinapic acid content together with a lower loss of sinapic acid derivatives in the HEM varieties compared to rapeseed. Around 50% of the canolol formed in the roasted seed was shown to be extracted in the oil. Roasting of HEM seed before oil extraction was found to be a beneficial step to obtain canolol-enriched oil, which could improve the oxidative stability.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D029741', 'D002851', 'D002853', 'D005421', 'D005511', 'D016166', 'D009682', 'D013058', 'D009149', 'D009390', 'D010636', 'D010938', 'D012639', 'D017365', 'D014753']","['Brassica rapa', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Food Handling', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mustard Plant', 'Nepal', 'Phenols', 'Plant Oils', 'Seeds', 'Spices', 'Vinyl Compounds']",Isolation and identification of a potent radical scavenger (canolol) from roasted high erucic mustard seed oil from Nepal and its formation during roasting.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000302', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000302']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'isolation & purification', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22746294,2014
22575018,"This study investigated the fatty acid composition of lipid present in breast milk of mothers residing in urban and suburban regions of West Bengal with special emphasis on n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which played a crucial role in the growth and development of neonates. Milk samples collected from 135 mothers of middle income group (average monthly income around 'Rs 10,000/-') were analysed by gas liquid chromatography after extraction and transmethylation to determine fatty acid composition. Information about the dietary intake of individual mothers was obtained through food frequency questionnaire. The fractions of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids available in milk of urban mothers were 13.59 ± 0.94 and 3.65 ± 0.49, respectively, and in suburban mothers 12.74 ± 0.89 and 4.36 ± 0.39, respectively.

20104381,"Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in 115 samples of olive oil (extra virgin olive oil, virgin olive oil, olive oil, pomace olive oil and blended olive oil), cooking oil (corn oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, palm olein oil, soya oil, canola oil, mustard oil, peanut oil and mixed vegetable oil) and fat (butter and table margarine) collected from retail stores in Kuwait. Carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was detected in 43% of the samples analyzed. Benz[a]anthracene and chrysene were detected in 37 and 45% of the samples, respectively, that did not contain BaP. Of the individual non-carcinogenic PAHs, naphthalene showed the highest mean concentration (14 microg kg(-1)), while for the carcinogenic PAHs, BaP (0.92 microg kg(-1)) and chrysene (0.87 microg kg(-1)) showed the highest mean values. Approximately 20% of the samples within the olive oil and cooking oil sub-categories exceeded the EU maximum tolerable limit for BaP, with the highest level of 6.77 and 11.1 microg kg(-1), respectively. For the fat sub-category, 9% of the samples exceeded the tolerance limit, with the highest level of 3.67 microg kg(-1). The Kuwaiti general population's dietary exposure to the genotoxic PAHs (PAH8: benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene and benzo[ghi]perylene) was estimated to be 196 ng day(-1) (3.3 ng kg(-1) bw day(-1), assuming an average adult body weight of 60 kg). Results indicated that PAH8 and BaP(eq) (total sum benzo[a]pyrene equivalents) are more reliable measures of the concentrations of other carcinogenic PAHs in oil and fat samples, while BaP and PAHs alone are not good indicators of the occurrence or degree of contamination by carcinogenic PAHs in these food products.","Food additives & contaminants.

17408833,"The antioxidant, antifungal and antibacterial potentials of volatile oils and oleoresin of Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (leaf and bark) were investigated in the present study. The oleoresins have shown excellent activity for the inhibition of primary and secondary oxidation products in mustard oil added at the concentration of 0.02% which were evaluated using peroxide, thiobarbituric acid, p-anisidine and carbonyl values. Moreover, it was further supported by other complementary antioxidant assays such as ferric thiocyanate method in linoleic acid system, reducing power, chelating and scavenging effects on 1,1'-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radicals. In antimicrobial investigations, using inverted petriplate and food poison techniques, the leaf and bark volatile oils has been found to be highly effective against all the tested fungi except Aspergillus ochraceus. However, leaf oleoresin has shown inhibition only for Penicillium citrinum whereas bark oleoresin has caused complete mycelial zone inhibition for Aspergillus flavus and A. ochraceus along with Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, P. citrinum and Penicillium viridicatum at 6 microL. Using agar well diffusion method, leaf volatile oil and oleoresin have shown better results in comparison with bark volatile oil, oleoresin and commercial bactericide, i.e., ampicillin. Gas chromatographic-mass spectroscopy studies on leaf volatile oil and oleoresin resulted in the identification of 19 and 25 components, which accounts for the 99.4% and 97.1%, respectively of the total amount and the major component was eugenol with 87.3% and 87.2%, respectively. The analysis of cinnamon bark volatile oil showed the presence of 13 components accounting for 100% of the total amount. (E)-cinnamaldehyde was found as the major component along with delta-cadinene (0.9%), whereas its bark oleoresin showed the presence of 17 components accounting for 92.3% of the total amount.
