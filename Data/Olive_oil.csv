35209139,"Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a key component of the Mediterranean diet, with several health benefits derived from its consumption. Moreover, due to its eminent market position, EVOO has been thoroughly studied over the last several years, aiming at its authentication, but also to reveal the chemical profile inherent to its beneficial properties. In the present work, a comparative study was conducted to assess Greek EVOOs' quality and authentication utilizing different analytical approaches, both targeted and untargeted. 173 monovarietal EVOOs from three emblematic Greek cultivars (Koroneiki, Kolovi and Adramytiani), obtained during the harvesting years of 2018-2020, were analyzed and quantified as per their fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) composition via the official method (EEC) No 2568/91, as well as their bioactive content through liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) methodology. In addition to FAMEs analysis, EVOO samples were also analyzed via HRMS-untargeted metabolomics and optical spectroscopy techniques (visible absorption, fluorescence and Raman). The data retrieved from all applied techniques were analyzed with Machine Learning methods for the authentication of the EVOOs' variety. The models' predictive performance was calculated through test samples, while for further evaluation 30 commercially available EVOO samples were also examined in terms of variety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where different techniques from the fields of standard analysis, spectrometry and optical spectroscopy are applied to the same EVOO samples, providing strong insight into EVOOs chemical profile and a comparative evaluation through the different platforms.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D005227', 'D005504', 'D000074385', 'D063427', 'D006115', 'D055432', 'D000069463', 'D013057']","['Fatty Acids', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Ingredients', 'Food Quality', 'Greece', 'Metabolomics', 'Olive Oil', 'Spectrum Analysis']",Comparative Evaluation of Different Targeted and Untargeted Analytical Approaches to Assess Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil Quality and Authentication.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None]","['analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35209139,2022
35161972,"As it is high in value, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is frequently blended with inferior vegetable oils. This study presents an optical method for determining the adulteration level of EVOO with soybean oil as well as peanut oil using LED-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. Eight LEDs with central wavelengths from ultra-violet (UV) to blue are tested to induce the fluorescence spectra of EVOO, peanut oil, and soybean oil, and the UV LED of 372 nm is selected for further detection. Samples are prepared by mixing olive oil with different volume fractions of peanut or soybean oil, and their fluorescence spectra are collected. Different pre-processing and regression methods are utilized to build the prediction model, and good linearity is obtained between the predicted and actual adulteration concentration. This result, accompanied by the non-destruction and no pre-treatment characteristics, proves that it is feasible to use LED-induced fluorescence spectroscopy as a way to investigate the EVOO adulteration level, and paves the way for building a hand-hold device that can be applied to real market conditions in the future.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","['D010367', 'D005506', 'D000069463', 'D010938', 'D013024', 'D013050']","['Arachis', 'Food Contamination', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Soybean Oil', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']","Quantitative Detection of Extra Virgin Olive Oil Adulteration, as Opposed to Peanut and Soybean Oil, Employing LED-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35161972,2022

Fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) is a novel lipid class that was discovered as an endogenous lipid; FAHFAs have shown anti-diabetic effects in a mammalian system. We analyzed the overall FAHFA composition in nut oils and other common oils: almond (raw, roasted), walnut, peanut, olive, palm, soybean, and rapeseed oils. We developed a method of liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) for a comprehensive target analysis of FAHFAs. The analysis revealed wide variation in the FAHFA profiles (15 compounds and 62 peaks). For 7-11 compounds of FAHFA, a total level of 8-29 pmol/mg oil was detected in nuts oils; for 11 compounds, 4.9 pmol/mg oil was detected in olive oil, and for 4-9 compounds, < 2 pmol/mg oil was detected in palm, soy, and rapeseed oils. The major FAHFAs were FAHFA 36:3, FAHFA 36:2, and FAHFA 36:4 in nut oil, FAHFA 36:2, FAHFA 34:1, and FAHFA 36:1 in olive oil, and FAHFA 32:1, FAHFA 34:0, FAHFA 36:0, and FAHFA 36:1 in all of the common oils. The composition of FAHFAs in nut oils is mainly unsaturated fatty acids, whereas those in olive oil are unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. The composition of FAHFAs in common oils was mainly saturated fats. This is the first report to demonstrate the quality and quantity of the FAHFAs in the nut oils.

The other PAHs except fluorene were not observed (detection limit-0.009 µg/g) in all the samples. Among traditional processing techniques, higher PAH contents were observed as a result of frying. Frying with vegetable oil produced higher fluorene content (0.06-0.13 µg/g) in the deep-fried sample, although sesame oil is the best oil which produces lowest PAH contents in fried samples. Among all the processing techniques, lower fluorene (0.01-0.02 µg/g) content was noticed in poaching.

This comprehensive and quantitative investigation of the exposome is achieved in short run times, through simple extraction methods requiring small-sample volumes, and using integrated quality control procedures for ensuring data quality. This metabolomics approach was satisfactorily validated in terms of linearity, recovery, matrix effects, specificity, limits of quantification, intraday and interday precision, and carryover. Furthermore, the clinical potential of the methodology was demonstrated in a dietary intervention trial as a case study. In summary, this study describes the optimization, validation, and application of a multimetabolite platform for comprehensive and quantitative metabolomics-based exposome research with great utility in large-scale epidemiological studies.",Analytical chemistry,"['D000328', 'D002851', 'D004032', 'D004781', 'D000081413', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D055442', 'D055432', 'D000069463']","['Adult', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diet', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolome', 'Metabolomics', 'Olive Oil']",Characterization of the Human Exposome by a Comprehensive and Quantitative Large-Scale Multianalyte Metabolomics Platform.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000008']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32966057,2021
32930255,"Aflatoxins (AFs), as the secondary metabolites of the toxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, are well known to be extremely harmful to humans and animals because of their high toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity. Recurring and increasing studies on AF ingestion incidents indicate that AF contamination is a serious food safety issue worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, the IAC method may be limited to some laboratories because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) clean-up method based on humic acids (HAs), which is followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAs could be directly used as a DSPE sorbent after simple treatment without any chemical modification. In the HA-DSPE, AFs could remain on the HA sorbent by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was retained on HA via only hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix could be sufficiently washed off by n-hexane, whereas the AFs could still be retained on HA; thus, the selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices were achieved. Under the optimal conditions of HA-DSPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.3% to 106.2% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices i.e. blended oil, mixed olive oil, tea oil, sunflower seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, rice oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. Minor matrix effects ranging from 89.3% to 112.9% were obtained for the four AFs, which were acceptable. Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.063 and 0.102 μg kg-1 completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union (EU), China, or other countries. The proposed methodology was further validated using a naturally contaminated peanut oil, and the results indicated that the accuracy of the HA-DSPE could match the accuracy of the referenced IAC. In addition, HA-DSPE can be used to directly treat diluted edible oil without liquid-liquid extraction and HA is cheap and can be easily obtained from the market worldwide; these advantages make the proposed methodology simple, low-cost, and accessible for the determination of AFs in edible oils.",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,"['D000348', 'D001230', 'D001231', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004042', 'D005504', 'D006812', 'D010938', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Aflatoxins', 'Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Humic Substances', 'Plant Oils', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Facile dispersive solid-phase extraction based on humic acid for the determination of aflatoxins in various edible oils.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930255,2021

The release of As, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb from kitchen utensils composed of stainless steel, aluminum, copper alloy, and cast iron into food simulants was quantified using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The results show that this release of toxic metals was highly dependent on pH. Generally, the release of toxic metals tended to decrease with repeated use, and the release of Cr and Ni from stainless steel samples was significantly higher in the first test, compared to the third test. The washing conditions affected the release of As and Cr, whose release levels were higher when washing only with water and with a steel wool pad, respectively. Furthermore, oiling cast iron cookware reduced the release of As, Cd, Cr, and Ni into acidic simulants by 66%, 83%, 71%, and 15%, respectively.

32685425,"Lebanon has witnessed elevated levels of pollution over the last few years due to increased waste incineration, emissions from vehicles and electricity generators, and mass demonstrations involving the burning of tires. The resultant generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the incomplete combustion of organic materials present in these sources may contaminate various foods including olive oil. Lebanon has a sizeable olive oil industry that is a main pillar of its agricultural sector. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of 16 semi-volatile lipophilic organic pollutants in 25 bottled olive oil brands, marketed in Lebanon, using a solid phase extraction (SPE) method followed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). PAHs were detected in 60% of brands (41% of samples) where 12% of brands contained traces of probably carcinogenic (Class 2A) compounds and 56% of brands contained traces of possibly carcinogenic (Class 2B) compounds. One brand revealed levels of benzo[a]pyrene of 9.45 μg/kg and 11.9 μg/kg in batches collected over two production dates which are higher than the limit set by the European Commission for benzo[a]pyrene in food (2 μg/kg). The same batches contained a total of 19.3 μg/kg and 26.7 μg/kg of the four PAHs: benzo[a]pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and chrysene which also exceeded the limit set by the EC for the combination of these four PAHs in olive oil (10 μg/kg). This study is the first-of-its-kind in Lebanon and emphasizes the need to perform adequate cleanup steps in the manufacturing process in order to reduce the content of carcinogenic PAHs in olive oil.",Toxicological research,[],[],GC-MS analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in bottled olive oil marketed in Lebanon.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32685425,2021

Such a rise is a consequence of the increasing demand in the food sector to address challenges regarding the issues of food safety, quality, and authenticity in a more comprehensive way. Virgin olive oil (VOO) is a key product of the Mediterranean diet, with a globalized consumer interest as it may be associated with various nutritional and health benefits. Despite the strict legislation to protect this high added-value agricultural commodity and offer guarantees to consumers and honest producers, there are still analytical issues needing to be further addressed. Thus, this review aims to present the efforts made using targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches, namely nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry-based techniques (mainly LC/GC-MS) combined with multivariate statistical analysis. Case-studies focusing on geographical/varietal classification and detection of adulteration are discussed with regards to the identification of possible markers.

In this study, we hypothesized that diets with very different nutrient composition are able to change gut microbiome composition and metabolites in a very short period. We compared a fast food (FF) diet (ie, burgers and fries) with a Mediterranean (Med) diet, which is rich in vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, nuts, and fish. Ten healthy subjects participated in a controlled crossover study in which they consumed a Med diet and FF diet in randomized order for 4 days each, with a 4-day washout between treatments. Fecal DNA was extracted and the 16S V4 region amplified using polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq. Plasma metabolites and bile acids were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Certain bile-tolerant microbial genera and species including Collinsella, Parabacteroides, and Bilophila wadsworthia significantly increased after the FF diet. Some fiber-fermenting bacteria, including Lachnospiraceae and Butyricicoccus, increased significantly after the Med diet and decreased after the FF diet. Bacterially produced metabolites indole-3-lactic acid and indole-3-propionic acid, which have been shown to confer beneficial effects on neuronal cells, increased after the Med diet and decreased after the FF diet. Interindividual variability in response to the treatments may be related to differences in background diet, for example as shown by differences in Bilophila response in relationship to the saturated fat content of the baseline diet. In conclusion, an animal fat-rich, low-fiber FF diet v. a high-fiber Med diet altered human gut microbiome composition and its metabolites after just 4 days.","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)","['D000293', 'D000328', 'D001419', 'D001647', 'D001679', 'D018592', 'D004032', 'D038441', 'D057140', 'D005243', 'D000069196', 'D006801', 'D010802', 'D010865', 'D014364', 'D055815']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bacteria', 'Bile Acids and Salts', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Diet', 'Diet, Mediterranean', 'Fast Foods', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Phylogeny', 'Pilot Projects', 'Tryptophan', 'Young Adult']",Human gut microbiome composition and tryptophan metabolites were changed differently by fast food and Mediterranean diet in 4 days: a pilot study.,"[None, None, 'Q000145', 'Q000097', 'Q000097', None, None, None, None, 'Q000382', None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, None, 'classification', 'blood', 'blood', None, None, None, None, 'microbiology', None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330749,2021

Discrimination of fraudulent argan oils from virgin samples was performed by utilizing orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) regression modeling with good sensitivity and specificity. We suggested [γ-toc/α-toc] value as a new first screening adulteration factor (AF) that could be used to assess fraudulent argan oil samples. The distinct decrement in AF value was observed by the increase of adulteration rate. The AF values for virgin argan oils were ranged from 11.8 (lower limit) to 18.6 (upper limit).

There is no simple, reliable, and cost-effective isolation protocol for EVOO phenolics, which hinder their therapeutic applications. This study develops novel methods to isolate OC and other EVOO phenolics. This includes the use of ultra-freezing to eliminate most EVOO fats and the successful water capacity to efficiently extract OC and EVOO phenolics as self-emulsified nano-emulsion. Subsequent resin entrapment and size exclusion chromatography afforded individual EVOO phenolics in high purity.

The drying process of BRS Morena grapes, whether pre-treated or not with olive oil for producing raisins, resulted in qualitative and quantitative changes in their phenolic composition (anthocyanins, flavonols, stilbenes, hydroxycinammic acid derivatives, flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins). The raisins with the pre-treatment preserved more anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins than the raisins not pre-treated. Moreover, the total dehydration time accelerated by approximately 40% in the raisins pre-treated. Therefore, the production of raisins of BRS Morena grapes pre-treated with olive oil as a natural surfactant constitutes an interesting process from both the industrial and health points of view, because of the remarkable reduction in the processing time and the preservation of high concentrations of flavonoids, which have important claims to health benefits from biological activities.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000872', 'D002851', 'D003890', 'D005419', 'D044948', 'D005638', 'D010636', 'D010936', 'D044945', 'D013267', 'D027843']","['Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Desiccation', 'Flavonoids', 'Flavonols', 'Fruit', 'Phenols', 'Plant Extracts', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Stilbenes', 'Vitis']",Effect of the pre-treatment and the drying process on the phenolic composition of raisins produced with a seedless Brazilian grape cultivar.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30716936,2020

The main BPseco bioactive from green olive fruits, leaves, and table olives is oleuropein, while olive oil is rich in oleuropein downstream pathway molecules. The aim of this study was to probe olive BPseco downstream molecular pathways that are alike in biological and olive processing systems at different pHs and reaction times. The downstream molecular pathway were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI/MS) and typed neglected of different overlap (TNDO) computational methods. Our study showed oleuropein highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and HOMO-1 triggered the free radical processes, while HOMO-2 and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were polar reactions of glucoside and ester groups. Olive BPsecos were found to be stable under acid and base catalylic experiments. Oleuropein aglycone opened to diales and rearranged to hydroxytyrosil-elenolate under strong reaction conditions. The results suggest that competition among olive BPseco HOMOs could induce glucoside hydrolysis during olive milling due to native olive β-glucosidases.

Three groups of ewes were fed the following different diets: a control diet and two diets supplemented with OOP, obtained with a two-phase (OOP2) or three-phase (OOP3) olive milling process. Rumen liquor (RL) showed a higher content of 18:3 cis9 cis12 cis15 (α-linolenic acid, α-LNA) with OOP2 inclusion, and of 18:2 cis9 trans11 (rumenic acid, RA) with OOP3 inclusion. The overall composition of the RL microbiota did not differ among treatments. Significant differences, between control and treated groups, were found for six bacterial taxa. In particular, RL microbiota from animals fed OOPs showed a reduction in Anaerovibrio, a lipase-producing bacterium. The decrease in the Anaerovibrio genus may lead to a reduction in lipolysis, thus lowering the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids available for biohydrogenation. Milk from animals fed OOP showed a higher content of 18:1 cis9 (oleic acid, OA) but the α-LNA concentration was increased in milk from animals treated with OOP2 only.

Specifically, for each type of oil, the fatty acid composition was elucidated by GC-FID, the contents of selected polyphenols and squalene were determined respectively by UHPLC-MS and UHPLC-PDA, whereas minerals were explored by means of ICP-MS. Olive oil was confirmed to have the highest MUFA content due to a valuable level of oleic acid, while oils from grapeseed, Brazil nut and canola were marked by nutritionally important PUFA levels. The highest SFA content found in coconut oil was mainly due to the high levels of lauric acid, known for its advantageous HDL-raising effects. As for polyphenols, gourmet oils from palm, coconut and canola showed higher levels of phenolic acids (e.g. p-hydroxybenzoic, ferulic, syringic, acids) than olive oil, which was though characterized by peculiar antioxidants, such as tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol. Also, olive oil had the highest amount of squalene, followed by the oil from Brazil nut. Finally, all the investigated oils had very low levels (order of μg/kg) of pro-oxidant elements, such as Cu, Fe and Mn.

In parallel to genomic analysis, we subjected the samples to gas chromatography analysis of fatty acid composition. While the PCR-CE assay proved equally efficient as gas chromatography analysis in detecting adulteration with soybean, palm, rapeseed, sunflower, sesame, cottonseed and peanut oils, it was superior to the widely utilized analytical chemistry approach in revealing the adulterant species and detecting small quantities of corn and safflower oils in olive oil.

The present study was performed to test whether food intake is regulated by circulating FFAs in an oleate-specific manner. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of olive, safflower, or coconut oil (100mg/h), together with heparin, to raise circulating oleate, linoleate, or palmitate, respectively, and their effects on overnight food intake were evaluated. Compared to other oils, olive oil infusion showed a significantly greater effect to reduce food intake (P<0.01). Total caloric intake, the sum of the calories from the diet and infused oil, was significantly reduced with olive oil (P<0.01) but not with coconut or safflower oil infusion, suggesting an oleate-specific effect on caloric intake. To further test this idea, different groups of rats received an intravenous infusion of oleate, linoleate, or octanoate (0.5mg/h). Oleate infusion decreased overnight food intake by 26% (P<0.001), but no significant effect was seen with linoleate, octanoate, or vehicle infusion (P>0.05). The effects of olive oil or oleate infusion could not be explained by changes in plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, or total FFA levels. The olive oil effect on food intake was not reduced in vagotomized rats, suggesting that oleate sensing may not involve peripheral sensors. In contrast, olive oil's effect was attenuated in high-fat-fed rats, suggesting that this effect is regulated (or impaired) under physiological (or pathological) conditions.

However, each analytical run produces dense, multi-dimensional data, so elaboration and interpretation of chemical information is challenging. This study exploits recent advances of GC × GC-MS chromatographic fingerprinting to study VOCs distributions from Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) samples of a single botanical origin (Picual), cultivated in well-defined plots in Granada (Spain), and harvested at different maturation stages. A new integrated work-flow, fully supported by dedicated and automated software tools, combines untargeted and targeted (UT) approaches based on peak-region features to achieve the most inclusive fingerprinting. Combined results from untargeted and targeted methods are consistent, reliable, and informative on discriminant features (analytes) correlated with optimal ripening of olive fruits and sensory quality of EVOOs. The great flexibility of the UT fingerprinting here adopted enables retrospective analysis with great confidence and provides data to validate the transferability of ripening indicators ((Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-pentenal, nonanal, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, octane) to external samples sets. Direct image comparison, based on visual features, also is investigated for quick and effective pair-wise investigations.

27476797,"In this work, novel hybrid nanostructured surfaces, consisting of dense arrays of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) functionalized by Ag nanoparticles (AgNP/SiNWs), were used for the laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LDI-TOF MS) analysis of some typical unsaturated food components (e.g. squalene, oleic acid) to assess their MS performance. The synthesis of the novel platforms is an easy, cost-effective process based on the maskless wet-etching preparation at room temperature of SiNWs followed by their decoration with AgNPs, produced by pulsed laser deposition. No particular surface pretreatment or addition of organic matrixes/ionizers was necessary. Moreover, oil extracts (e.g. extra virgin olive oil, peanut oil) could be investigated on AgNP/SiNWs surfaces, revealing their different MS profiles. It was shown that such substrates operate at reduced laser energy, typically generating intense silver cluster ions and analyte adducts. A comparison with bare SiNWs was also performed, indicating the importance of AgNP density on NW surface. In this case, desorption/ionization on silicon was invoked as probable LDI mechanism. Finally, the influence of SiNW length and surface composition on MS results was assessed. The combination of typical properties of SiNWs (hydrophobicity, antireflectivity) with ionization ability of metal NPs can be a valid methodology for the further development of nanostructured surfaces in LDI-TOF MS applications.

We explored the association between the adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, and its components, with faecal microbiota in a cohort of adults with non-declared pathology. This transversal study involved 31 adults without a previous diagnosis of cancer, autoimmune or digestive diseases. Based on the data obtained by means of an annual food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and the information existing in the literature, a Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was calculated. Dietary fibre was obtained from Marlett et al. tables and Phenol-Explorer Database was used for phenolic compounds intake. Quantification of microbial groups was performed by Ion Torrent 16S rRNA gene-based analysis and quantification of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS).

In particular, oxidative and hydrolytic degradation (by routine and non-conventional analyses), phenolic profiles (by HPLC), volatile compounds (by SPME-GC/MS), antioxidant activity, and sensory properties (by a trained panel and by consumers) of the oils were evaluated. The obtained results evidenced that the malaxation method was more effective in extracting the phenolic compounds, with a significantly lower level of hydrolysis of secoiridoids. As a consequence, antioxidant activity was significantly lower in the oils obtained by infusion, which were characterized by a higher extent of the oxidative degradation.

We propose the monitoring, in whole mouse liver extracts and in isolated mitochondria, of the absorption of compounds from three different diets: standard (CT), high-fat (HFD) and high-fat supplemented with EVOO (HFSO). Male mice were submitted to one of the following three diets: CT or HFD for 16 weeks or HFD for 8 weeks followed by additional 8 weeks with HFSO. Following this period, liver was extracted for histological evaluation, mitochondria isolation and mass spectrometry analyses. Diets, liver extracts and Percoll-purified mitochondria were analyzed using ESI-MS and the lipidomics approach. Morphological, histological and spectrometric results indicated a decrease in NASH severity with EVOO supplementation in comparison with animals maintained with HFD. Spectrometric data also demonstrated that some compounds presented on the diets are absorbed by the mitochondria. EVOO was shown to be a potential therapeutic alternative in food for NASH.

26340625,"Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with its nutraceutical characteristics substantially contributes as a major nutrient to the health benefit of the Mediterranean diet. Unfortunately, the adulteration of EVOO with less expensive oils (e.g., peanut and corn oils), has become one of the biggest source of agricultural fraud in the European Union, with important health implications for consumers, mainly due to the introduction of seed oil-derived allergens causing, especially in children, severe food allergy phenomena. In this regard, revealing adulterations of EVOO is of fundamental importance for health care and prevention reasons, especially in children. To this aim, effective analytical methods to assess EVOO purity are necessary. Here, we propose a simple, rapid, robust and very sensitive method for non-specialized mass spectrometric laboratory, based on the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled to unsupervised hierarchical clustering (UHC), principal component (PCA) and Pearson's correlation analyses, to reveal corn oil (CO) adulterations in EVOO at very low levels (down to 0.5%).

Thermal processing changes the properties of edible oils and can also modify their metabolism, for example, eicosanoids formation. The aim of our study was to verify whether the activity of desaturases can be modified by lipids intake, especially by the fatty acids content. The experimental diets contained rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, and olive oil, both unheated and heated (for 10 minutes at 200 °C each time before administration), and influenced the fatty acids composition in serum and the activity of enzymes participating in arachidonic acid (AA) formation. The activity of desaturases was determined by measuring the amounts of AA formed in vitro derived from linoleic acid as determined in liver microsomes of Wistar rats. In addition, the indices of ∆(6)-desaturase (D6D) and ∆(5)-desaturase (D5D) have been determined. To realize this aim, the method of high-performance liquid chromatography has been used with ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry detection. Diet supplementation with the oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids affects the fatty acids profile in blood serum and the activity of D6D and ∆(5)-desaturase in rat liver microsomes, the above activities being dependent on the kind of oil applied. Diet supplementation with heated oils has been found to increase the amount of AA produced in hepatic microsomes; and in the case of rapeseed oil and sunflower oil, it has also increased D6D activity.","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)","['D000818', 'D016718', 'D002851', 'D000090943', 'D004032', 'D044943', 'D005227', 'D005229', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D019787', 'D050602', 'D008862', 'D010938', 'D000074262', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D000074242']","['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Delta-5 Fatty Acid Desaturase', 'Diet', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Linoleoyl-CoA Desaturase', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Plant Oils', 'Rapeseed Oil', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sunflower Oil']",Heating of vegetable oils influences the activity of enzymes participating in arachidonic acid formation in Wistar rats.,"[None, 'Q000096', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000201', 'Q000008', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'blood', None, 'methods', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'enzymology', 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26094213,2016
26066859,"Cooking fumes are an important indoor source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Because indoor pollution has a more substantial impact on human health than outdoor pollution, PAHs from cooking fumes have drawn considerable attention. In this study, 16 PAHs emitted through deep-frying and frying methods using rapeseed, soybean, peanut, and olive oil were examined under a laboratory fume hood. Controlled experiments were conducted to collect gas- and particulate-phase PAHs emitted from the cooking oil fumes, and PAH concentrations were quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results show that deep-frying methods generate more PAHs and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) (1.3 and 10.9 times, respectively) because they consume greater volumes of edible oil and involve higher oil temperatures relative to those of frying methods. In addition, the total B[a]Peq concentration of deep-frying is 2.2-fold larger than that of frying. Regarding the four types of edible oils studied, rapeseed oil produced more PAH emission than the other three oil varieties. For all of the cooking tests, three- and four-ringed PAHs were the main PAH components regardless of the food and oil used. Concerning the PAH partition between gas and particulate phase, the gaseous compounds accounted for 59-96 % of the total. Meanwhile, the particulate fraction was richer of high molecular weight PAHs (five-six rings). Deep-frying and frying were confirmed as important sources of PAH pollution in internal environments.

Deep frying and sautéing led to increased fat contents and TPC, whereas both types of boiling (in water and W/O) reduced the same. The presence of EVOO in cooking increased the phenolics identified in the raw foods as oleuropein, pinoresinol, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, and the contents of vegetable phenolics such as chlorogenic acid and rutin.

The signals extracted by ICA corresponded to natural olive oil fluorophores (tocopherols and polyphenols) as well as newly formed ones which were tentatively identified as fluorescent oxidation products. Based on the extracted fluorescent signals, olive oil in contact with plastics had slower aging rates in comparison with reference oils. Peroxide and free acidity values validated the results obtained by ICA, related to olive oil oxidation rates.

24756094,"Carotenoids are well known for their nutritional properties and health promoting effects representing attractive ingredients to develop innovative functional foods, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical preparations. Pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.) flesh has an intense yellow/orange color owing to the high level of carotenoids, mainly α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin. There is considerable interest in extracting carotenoids and other bioactives from pumpkin flesh. Extraction procedures able to preserve nutritional and pharmacological properties of carotenoids are essential. Conventional extraction methods, such as organic solvent extraction (CSE), have been used to extract carotenoids from plant material for a long time. In recent years, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction has received a great deal of attention because it is a green technology suitable for the extraction of lipophylic molecules and is able to give extracts of high quality and totally free from potentially toxic chemical solvents. Here, we review the results obtained so far on SC-CO2 extraction efficiency and quali-quantitative composition of carotenoids from pumpkin flesh. In particular, we consider the effects of (1) dehydration pre-treatments; (2) extraction parameters (temperature and pressure); the use of water, ethanol and olive oil singularly or in combination as entrainers or pumpkin seeds as co-matrix.

The effect of cooking time (15, 30, 45, and 60 min) and the addition of extra virgin olive oil (5 and 10%) on the phenolic content of tomato sauces was monitored using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Concentration of phenolics in the tomato sauces decreased during the cooking process, with the exception of caffeic acid and tyrosol. The main degradation observed was the oxidation of quercetin, since the hydroxy-function at the C-ring of this flavonoid is not blocked by a sugar moiety, unlike rutin. Higher levels of virgin olive oil in tomato sauce seemed to enhance the extraction of phenolic compounds from the tomato, leading to higher phenolic contents in the sauces.

24128590,"The purpose of this study was to structurally characterise the polar lipids of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), fed with an experimental diet containing olive pomace (OP), that exhibit cardioprotective activities. OP has been added to conventional fish oil (FO) feed at 4% and this was the OP diet, having been supplemented as finishing diet to fish. Sea bass was aquacultured using either FO or OP diet. At the end of the dietary experiment, lipids in both samples of fish muscle were quantified and HPLC fractionated. The in vitro cardioprotective properties of the polar lipid fractions, using washed rabbit's platelets, have been assessed and the two most biologically active fractions were further analysed by mass spectrometry. The gas-chromatrograpy-mass spectrometric data shows that these two fractions contain low levels of myristic (14:0), oleic (18:1 cis ω-9) and linoleic acids (18:2 ω-6), but high levels of palmitic (16:0) and stearic acids (18:0) as well as eicosadienoic acid (20:2 ω-6). The first fraction (MS1) also contained significant levels of arachidonic acid (20:4 ω-6) and the omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (22:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6). Electrospray-mass spectrometry elucidated that the lipid composition of the two fractions contained various diacyl-glycerophospholipids species, where the majority of them have either 18:0 or 18:1 fatty acids in the sn-1 position and either 22:6 or 20:2 fatty acids in the sn-2 position for MS1 and MS2, respectively.

24016262,"With the wide application of plastics, the contamination of plasticizers migrating from plastic materials in the environment is becoming ubiquitous. The presence of phthalates, the major group of plasticizers, in edible items has gained increasingly more concern due to their endocrine disrupting property. In this study, 15 plasticizers in 21 edible vegetable oils purchased from a U.S. retail market were analyzed using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) were detected in all oil samples. Benzylbutyl phthalate (BzBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were detected at a rate of 95.2, 90.5, and 90.5%, respectively. The detection rates for all other plasticizers ranged from 0 to 57.1%. The content of total plasticizers in oil samples was determined to be 210-7558 μg/kg, which was comparable to the content range in oil marketed in Italy. Although no significant difference (p = 0.05) in the total content of plasticizer was observed among oil species (soybean, canola, corn, and olive), the wider range and higher average of total content of plasticizers in olive oil than other oil species indicated the inconsistence of plasticizer contamination in olive oil and a possible priority for quality monitoring. No significant difference (p = 0.05) in the total content of plasticizers was found among glass-bottle (n = 4), plastic-bottle (n = 14), and metal-can (n = 3) packaging, implying that oil packaging is not the major cause of plasticizer contamination. The daily intake amount of plasticizers contained in edible oil on this U.S. retail market constituted only a minimum percentage of reference dose established by US EPA, thus no obvious toxicological effect might be caused. However, the fact that DEHP content in two olive oils exceeded relevant special migration limits (SMLs) of Europe and China might need attention.

Reactions are faster in alcohols than in ethyl acetate that is used routinely for the analysis of antioxidant potential (AOP) of nonpolar samples such as vegetable oils. Incorporation of an acid base pair into the assay solvent buffers the system against acid impurities such as free fatty acids and CO2 from the air. This is shown to increase the rate of oxidation and number of electrons of phenolic compounds exchanged with DPPH. Typically, DPPH assays are performed for predetermined time intervals at which phenolic compounds are not fully oxidized and therefore higher reaction rates result in higher values of AOP. More than twofold AOP was obtained for oleuropein, sesamol, sinapic acid, caffeic acid and protocatechuic acid in buffered alcohols than in ethyl acetate.

Blind duplicate samples of blank, spiked at levels ranging from 0.25 to 20.0 microg/kg for AF, were analyzed. A naturally contaminated peanut oil sample was also included. Test samples were extracted with methanol-water (55 + 45, v/v). After shaking and centrifuging, the lower layer was filtered, diluted with water, and filtered through glass microfiber filter paper. The filtrate was then passed through an IAC, and the toxins were eluted with methanol. The toxins were then subjected to RPLC-FLD analysis after postcolumn derivatization. Average recoveries of AFs from olive oil, peanut oil, and sesame oil ranged from 84 to 92% (at spiking levels ranging from 2.0 to 20.0 microg/kg); of AFB1 from 86 to 93% (at spiking levels ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 microg/kg); of AFB2 from 89 to 95% (at spiking levels ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 microg/kg); of AFG1 from 85 to 97% (at spiking levels ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 microg/kg); and of AFG2 from 76 to 85% (at spiking levels ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 microg/kg).

22782973,"Mitochondrial enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI1) is an auxiliary enzyme involved in unsaturated fatty acid oxidation. In contrast to most of the other enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, a deficiency of ECI1 has yet to be identified in humans. We used wild-type (WT) and Eci1-deficient knockout (KO) mice to explore a potential presentation of human ECI1 deficiency. Upon food withdrawal, Eci1-deficient mice displayed normal blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels (WT 1.09 mM vs. KO 1.10 mM), a trend to lower blood glucose levels (WT 4.58 mM vs. KO 3.87 mM, P=0.09) and elevated blood levels of unsaturated acylcarnitines, in particular C12:1 acylcarnitine (WT 0.03 μM vs. KO 0.09 μM, P<0.01). Feeding an olive oil-rich diet induced an even greater increase in C12:1 acylcarnitine levels (WT 0.01 μM vs. KO 0.04 μM, P<0.01). Overall, the phenotypic presentation of Eci1-deficient mice is mild, possibly caused by the presence of a second enoyl-CoA isomerase (Eci2) in mitochondria. Knockdown of Eci2 in Eci1-deficient fibroblasts caused a more pronounced accumulation of C12:1 acylcarnitine on incubation with unsaturated fatty acids (12-fold, P<0.05). We conclude that Eci2 compensates for Eci1 deficiency explaining the mild phenotype of Eci1-deficient mice.

22766882,"Olive mill wastewater (OMW) results from the production of olive oil, which is an important traditional agro-industry in Mediterranean countries. In continuous three-phase centrifugation 1.0-1.2 m(3) of OMW are produced per ton of processed olives. Discharge of OMW is of serious environmental concern due to its high content of organic matter with phytotoxic properties, namely phenolic compounds. Meanwhile, drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS) is produced in high amounts and has long been considered as a waste for landfill. The aim of this work was the assessment of reusing DWTS for OMW treatment. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was carried out to determine the phenolic compounds present and to evaluate if they are recalcitrant. Treatability assays were performed using a dosage of DWTS from 50 to 300 g L(-1). Treatment efficiency was evaluated based on the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total solids (TS), total suspended solids (TSS), total volatile solids (TVS), oil and grease (OG), phenols (total phosphorous (TP) and HPLC fraction). Results from OMW HPLC characterization identified a total of 13 compounds; the major ones were hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, caffeic acid, p-cumaric acid and oleuropein. Treatability assays led to a maximum reduction of about 90% of some of the phenolic compounds determined by HPLC. Addition of 200-300 g L(-1) of DWTS reduced 40-50% of COD, 45-50% of TP, a maximum of nearly 70% TSS and 45% for TS and TVS. The OG fraction showed a reduction of about 90%, achieved adding 300 g L(-1) od DWTS. This study points out the possibility of establishing an integrated management of OMW and DWTS, contributing to a decrease in the environmental impact of two industrial activities, olive oil production and drinking water treatment.",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,"['D057919', 'D060766', 'D005525', 'D007220', 'D000069463', 'D010938', 'D059027', 'D014865', 'D014874', 'D018508']","['Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis', 'Drinking Water', 'Food-Processing Industry', 'Industrial Waste', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Recycling', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Water Purification']",Reuse of drinking water treatment sludge for olive oil mill wastewater treatment.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'methods', 'methods', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22766882,2012
22715692,"A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was developed for the determination of 40 pesticides in fruits. The effects of adding analyte protectants were evaluated for compensating matrix effects and the impacts on the quantitative results. A new combination of analyte protectants - Polyethylene Glycol 400 (PEG 400) and olive oil combination, which can be dissolved in acetone, was used for the quantitative analysis. The pesticides were extracted from fruit samples with acetonitrile and the extracts were cleaned up using micro-solid phase extraction. A GC-MS method in selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode coupled with large volume injection was finally developed. Using the newly developed analyte protectant combination of PEG 400 and olive oil, a good linearity was obtained in the range of 1 - 200 microg/L with coefficients better than 0.99, and the detection limits were between 0.1 - 3.0 microg/L. The mean recoveries of the pesticides were 75% - 119% with the relative standard deviation values less than 16.6% except for dimethoate. The performance of the analyte protectants was compared with matrix-matched standards calibration curves in terms of quantitative accuracy. The results showed that the method of adding analyte protectants can replace the matrix-matched standard calibration, and can also reduce the sample pretreatment.

22608778,"In this work, the capability of gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) for quantitative analysis of pesticide residues has been evaluated. A multiclass method for rapid screening of pesticides (insecticides, acaricides, herbicides and fungicides) in fruit and vegetable matrices has been developed and validated, including detection, identification and quantification of the analytes. To this aim, several food matrices were selected: high water content (apples, tomatoes and carrots), high acid content (oranges) and high oil content (olives) samples. The well known QuEChERS procedure was applied for extraction of pesticides, and matrix-matched calibration using relative responses versus internal standard was used for quantification. The sample extracts were analyzed by GC-TOF MS. Up to five ions using narrow window (0.02 Da)-extracted ion chromatograms at the expected retention time were monitored using a target processing method. The most abundant ion was used for quantification while the remaining ones were used for confirmation of the analyte identity. Method validation was carried out for 55 analytes in the five sample matrices tested at three concentrations (0.01, 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg). Most recoveries were between 70% and 120% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20% at 0.05 and 0.5mg/kg. At 0.01 mg/kg, roughly half of the pesticides could be satisfactorily validated due to sensitivity limitations of GC-TOF MS, which probably affected the ion ratios used for confirmation of identity. In the case of olive samples, results were not satisfactory due to the high complexity of the matrix. An advantage of TOF MS is the possibility to perform a non-target investigation in the samples by application of a deconvolution software, without any additional injection being required. Accurate-mass full-spectrum acquisition in TOF MS provides useful information for analytes identification, and has made feasible in this work the discovery of non-target imazalil, fluoranthene and pyrene in some of the samples analyzed.",Journal of chromatography.

21424962,"Trace element analysis plays an important role in oil characterisation and in the detection of oil adulteration because the quality of edible oils and fats is affected by their trace metal content. In this study, the quantification of selected metals in various oils and fats (rice oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, soy oil, olive oil, light margarine, regular margarine and butter) was carried out using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) after sample emulsification. FAAS was used to determine the Na, K, Ca, Mg, Zn and Fe levels in the samples, while GFAAS was used for quantifying Cr, Ni, As, Pb, Cd, Cu and Mn, as these elements appeared in the samples at much lower concentrations. Tween-80 and Triton X-100 were employed as surfactants, and emulsions were prepared by a conventional method that involved heating and mixing of the constituents. Complete stabilisation was achieved through magnetic stirring for 15 min at room temperature. The evaluated figures of merit were linearity, accuracy and sensitivity, which were determined by the characteristic concentration and mass. Analysis of spiked samples demonstrated accuracy, which ranged from 90% (Na) to 112% (Fe) for FAAS and from 83% (Cd) to 121% (Pb) for GFAAS measurements. Atomic absorption spectrometry proved to be a promising approach for the analysis of metals in emulsified edible oils and fats. Additionally, under appropriate emulsification conditions (formulation, stirring time and temperature), the emulsions were homogeneous, had excellent stability, and had appropriate viscosity. The proposed method has proved to be simple, sensitive, reproducible, and economical.","Food additives & contaminants.

21329394,"The quality of extra virgin olive oil is associated with the presence of microcomponents whose healing effects have been proved in some special cases. The enzymatic hydrolysis of oleuropein and ligstroside, and of their demethylated analogues, affords four different pentanedialdehydes, and for one of which, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl (3S,4E)-4-formyl-3-(2-oxoethyl)hex-4-enoate, also known as oleocanthal, an anti-inflammatory effect was quite recently carefully assessed. Extra virgin olive oil is now worldwide considered as a functional food whose daily intake, as for the Mediterranean diet, helps consumers in keeping a constant level of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in the blood. The presence of these active principles provides, therefore, olive oil with an important added value. In the framework of the actions of the recently funded Agrifood Regional Center, which should coordinate the scientific research and production worlds, an absolute analytical method was developed for the mass spectrometric detection of the two most abundant NSAIDs, Tyr-OLPD and HTyr-OLPD (oleopentanedialdehydes (OLPDs) conjugated to p-hydroxyphenylethanol and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol, respectively), by UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS.",Analytical chemistry,"['D000447', 'D002851', 'D057230', 'D000069463', 'D010938', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D021241', 'D053719']","['Aldehydes', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Limit of Detection', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",High-throughput assay of oleopentanedialdheydes in extra virgin olive oil by the UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS and isotope dilution methods.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21329394,2011

HCAs were extracted by blue rayon, analyzed as spiked and unspiked samples with high-performance liquid chromatography and its mutagenic response was assessed by Sallmonela typhimurium 100 in the Ames test. Surprisingly, GT and GT+OL augmented HCAs measured in beef shawerma and grilled chicken but total HCAs measured in GT+OL were less than GT treatment. Both treatments altered the HCA profile as imidazoquinoline type became the most abundant. In control and GT+OL fried beef liver no HCAs were detected, but Trp-P1 was detected in GT treatment. Generally, the mutagenic response of HCAs measured in GT+OL was less than GT in beef shawerma and grilled chicken. However, the mutagenic response of control and 2% GT+OL fried liver was negative. These data suggest that GT concentrations used in this study may induce free radical formation during the Millared reaction due to its pro-oxidative effect, which augmented the HCAs formed and its mutagenic response.

21122869,"European food legislation defines a set of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as of high concern for human health. The EU set contains structurally very similar PAHs with ring numbers between 4 and 6, and so raises some separation aspects and problems, which were not experienced with traditionally analysed PAHs. Many of the currently applied gas chromatographic mass spectrometric (GC-MS) methods suffer from separation problems, while high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) is neither capable of detecting the whole set of EU priority PAHs nor does it (compared to GC-MS) allow structural identification. In addition HPLC-FLD shows limitations with difficult matrices due to interferences. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by describing a liquid chromatographic dopant assisted atmospheric pressure photo ionisation tandem mass spectrometric (LC-DA-APPI-MS/MS) method for the determination of 15+1 EU priority PAHs in edible oil, which complies with the requirements set by European food legislation. Measurements were performed in positive ion mode. Anisole at a flow rate of 30 μl/min was used as dopant. Sample preparation was performed offline by donor-acceptor complex chromatography (DACC). Compared to HPLC-FLD methods the presented method enables the determination of all 15+1 EU priority PAHs at the low μg/kg concentration range including less fluorescence active compounds like benzo[j]fluoranthene and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene. By analysing four reference materials it could be demonstrated that this method provides accurate results and is sufficiently sensitive for food control purposes. Statistically significant differences between the reference values and the measured analyte contents were not found. The method performs well also for very complex samples. Repeatability relative standard deviations (RSDr) of the determination of the target PAHs in olive oil were for most analytes below 5%. The limit of detection (LOD) of the method met the requirement set by EU legislation (0.3 μg/kg).",Journal of chromatography.

Many analytical approaches have been developed in recent years to trace HAO in EVOO, principally based on chromatographic analyses, differential scanning calorimetry or nuclear magnetic resonance. In addition adulteration of EVOO with HAO may introduce hazelnut-derived allergens. The aim of this work was to analyse the protein and allergen content of EVOO intentionally spiked with raw cold-pressed HAO or solvent-extracted HAO. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the presence of hazelnut proteins in solvent-extracted HAO with molecular masses ranging 10-60 kDa. In contrast, cold-pressed HAO showed no traces of protein. In spiked EVOO, solvent-extracted HAO was still detectable at a 1% contamination level. Several bands on SDS-PAGE migrated at apparent molecular masses coinciding with known allergens, such as Cor a 1 (approximately 17 kDa), Cor a 2 (approximately 14 kDa), Cor a 8 (approximately 12 kDa), oleosin (approximately 17 kDa) and Cor a 9 (approximately 60 kDa). MALDI-TOF MS analysis confirmed the presence of two oleosin isoforms and of Cor a 9. Immunoblotting demonstrated that an allergic patient with known reactivity to Cor a 1 and Cor a 2 recognized a 17-kDa band in solvent-extracted HAO. In conclusion, we have shown that adulteration of extra virgin olive oil with solvent-extracted hazelnut oil can be traced by simple SDS-PAGE analysis, and that adulteration introduces a potential risk for hazelnut allergic patients.","Food additives & contaminants.

19720448,"The application of hypochlorite for the removal of soluble COD, phenolic and polyphenolic like compounds, and other organic compounds responsible for the olive mill wastewater (OOWW) colour has been experimentally studied. After the OOWW filtration on a sand column, the effluent was subjected to a fast liming under optimal conditions. Lime application reduced polyphenols, COD and SS contents to half of their initial values but an important blackening of the treated OOWW was observed, especially when adding high concentrations of lime (10% (W/V) and 15% (W/V)). A second stage of treatment was applied using calcium hypochlorite. In this stage, removal of the studied compounds reached as much as 95% at higher concentrations, and particularly the colouring of OOWW which is generally difficult to eliminate was greatly reduced. The OOWW hypochloration acted through coagulation-flocculation and a rapid oxidation of the organic matter proceeded from the first 5min. The kinetic study of the degradation of the waste polluting compounds from liming showed that Ca(ClO)(2) reacts similarly in the elimination of organic compounds, polyphenols, SS and colouration.

19569104,"In this paper we illustrate the use of two different methodologies to investigate the presence of pesticide metabolites in parent pesticide-positive food samples, using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (UHPLC-QTOF) mass spectrometry. First, a common fragmentation pathway between the parent pesticide and its metabolites has been considered to search for metabolites in two positive market samples (imazalil in lemon, chlorpyrifos in grape). Secondly, olive oil samples from field residue trials were used for automated application of comparative software (MetaboLynx), which was used with treated and untreated samples to search for expected and unexpected metabolites of phosmet. One of the main objectives when using these approaches was to avoid the tedious manual searching for potential metabolites within the huge amount of information contained in the total ion chromatogram acquired by TOF MS. The common fragmentation approach applied to TOF MS full-acquisition data, considering an enhanced fragmentation in the collision cell, has allowed the discovery of two metabolites of imazalil (1-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-1H-imidazole and 1-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-1H-imidazole) in a lemon positive sample, as well as another two metabolites of chlorpyrifos (chlorpyrifos-oxon and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol) in a grape positive sample. Moreover, MetaboLynx application to TOF MS data, without promoting fragmentation, from treated and untreated olive oil samples has been helpful in detecting the metabolite phosmet-oxon. In both strategies, every metabolite detected by TOF MS was confirmed using QTOF and/or triple quadrupole instruments.

19166297,"The olive oil phenolic oleocanthal is a natural nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compound that irritates the oral pharynx in a dose-dependent manner. It has been proposed that the biological activity of oleocanthal is partially responsible for the beneficial health effects of the Mediterranean diet. Virgin olive oil containing oleocanthal is often added as an ingredient in a number of cooked dishes, and therefore it is of great importance to understand how best to preserve the putative health-promoting benefits of this compound, as olive oil phenolics are subject to degradation upon heating in general. One extra virgin olive oil containing 53.9 mg/kg oleocanthal was heated at various temperatures (100, 170, and 240 degrees C) for set time periods (0, 1, 5, 20, 60, and 90 min). Oleocanthal concentrations were quantified using HPLC, and its biological activity was determined with a taste bioassay measuring the intensity of throat irritation. Results demonstrated that oleocanthal was heat stable compared with other olive oil phenolics, with a maximum loss of 16% as determined by HPLC analysis. However, there was a significant decrease of up to 31% (p < 0.05) in the biological activity of oleocanthal as determined by the taste bioassay. Although there was minimal degradation of oleocanthal concentration, there was a significant decrease in the biological activity of oleocanthal upon extended heating time, indicating a possible loss of the putative health -benefiting properties of oleocanthal. Alternatively, the difference in the concentration and biological activity of oleocanthal after heat treatment could be a result of an oleocanthal antagonist forming, decreasing or masking the biological activity of oleocanthal.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000328', 'D000447', 'D000893', 'D002851', 'D000081004', 'D004355', 'D005260', 'D005511', 'D006293', 'D006358', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D000069463', 'D009960', 'D010636', 'D010938', 'D013649']","['Adult', 'Aldehydes', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclopentane Monoterpenes', 'Drug Stability', 'Female', 'Food Handling', 'Health Promotion', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Olive Oil', 'Oropharynx', 'Phenols', 'Plant Oils', 'Taste']",Influence of heat on biological activity and concentration of oleocanthal--a natural anti-inflammatory agent in virgin olive oil.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000494', None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'analysis', 'pharmacology', None, None, None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19166297,2009

The highest concentrations of As, Hg, and Pb (raw and cooked samples) were mainly found in fish, with a clear tendency, in general, to increase metal concentrations after cooking. However, in these samples, Cd levels were very close to their detection limit. In turn, the concentrations of metals in raw and cooked meat samples were detected in all samples (As) or only in a very few samples (Cd, Hg, and Pb). A similar finding corresponded to string beans, rice, and olive oil, while in potatoes, Hg could not be detected and Pb only was detected in the raw samples.

The composition of the plasticizers in the gaskets was analysed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) and phthalates were determined in the homogenized food samples. ESBO was the principal plasticizer in five of the gaskets; in 14 it was phthalates. ESBO was found in seven of the food samples at concentrations from 6 to 100 mg kg(-1). The highest levels (91-100 mg kg(-1)) were in oily foods such as garlic, chilli or olives in oil. Phthalates, i.e. di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP) and di-iso-nonylphthalates (DINP), were found in seven samples at 6-173 mg kg(-1). The highest concentrations (99-173 mg kg(-1)) were in products of garlic and tomatoes in oil and in fatty food products such as sauce béarnaise and peanut butter.

A total number of 566 samples (pure oils and samples of adulterated olive oil) were used to develop the chemometric models, which were designed to accomplish, step-by-step, the three aims of the method: to detect whether an olive oil sample is adulterated, to identify the type of adulterant used in the fraud, and to determine how much aldulterant is in the sample. Qualitative analysis was carried out via two chemometric approaches--soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) and K nearest neighbours (KNN)--both approaches exhibited prediction abilities that were always higher than 91% for adulterant detection and 88% for type of adulterant identification.

Two samples (one unfortified and one fortified at 2 microg kg(-1)) of five oils (virgin olive oil, grapeseed oil, toasted sesame oil, olive margarine and palm oil) were also analysed. The validation included an assessment of measurement bias from the results of 120 measurements of a certified reference material (coconut oil BCR CRM458 certified for six PAHs).

Among the vegetables, tomatoes are a main component of the traditional Mediterranean diet, which has been associated with health protection and longevity. Eating tomatoes has been associated with reduced risks of some types of cancer and other diseases. These beneficial properties appear to be related to the antioxidant content of the fruit, particularly carotenoids (lycopene and beta-carotene), ascorbic acid, and phenols, which may play a role in inhibiting reactions mediated by reactive oxygen species. Due to the importance of antioxidant compounds in tomatoes and tomato products, we present here an overview of current analytical methods (from 2000 until the present date) for determining the different antioxidants. The analytical procedures used to determine individual compounds involve extraction from the sample, analytical separation, and quantification.

16541407,"The recently introduced technique of an atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) source coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QqTOFMS) has been applied to fast olive oil fingerprinting on the basis of the accurate mass measurements obtained with this instrumentation. The key compounds can be characterized as [M+H]+ (produced by proton transfer) or as [M]+* (by charge transfer) ions in the mass spectra. [M+H]+ ions, however, show higher abundance, especially for triacylglycerols. Other ions present in APPI-MS are the acylium ion [RiCO]+ and [RiCO-H2O]+. This latter ion is absent in the electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS spectra, and this represents valuable complementary information. Several critical parameters in the APPI source were optimized such as LC eluent composition, ion spray voltage and, especially, declustering potential. APPI-QqTOFMS allows easy discrimination among different edible oils: olive, extra virgin olive, olive-pomace, hazelnut, sunflower, corn and several mixed oils, with high throughput (approximately 1 min per sample). Cluster analysis was applied to obtain the best experimental conditions for oil discrimination on the basis of declustering potential.

Wheat grain yield increased significantly as an effect of olive pomace amendment. In particular, the increases were related to kernel weight, kernel number per square meter, and soil organic matter content. Possibly, the enhanced amount of soil organic matter in olive-pomace-amended soils relieved wheat of drought stress from anthesis to maturity by promoting a good soil structure, thereby reducing water loss by evaporation.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D005638', 'D006812', 'D007220', 'D019083', 'D031658', 'D000069463', 'D010938', 'D012987', 'D013050', 'D017550', 'D014908']","['Fruit', 'Humic Substances', 'Industrial Waste', 'Mediterranean Region', 'Olea', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Soil', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Triticum']",Olive pomace amendment in Mediterranean conditions: effect on soil and humic acid properties and wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) yield.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000254']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'growth & development']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16104792,2005

15941058,"Control of adulteration of olive oil, together with authentication and contamination, is one of the main aspects in the quality control of olive oil. Adulteration with hazelnut oil is one of the most difficult to detect due to the similar composition of hazelnut and olive oils; both virgin olive oil and olive oil are subjected to that kind of adulteration. The main objective of this work was to develop an analytical method able to detect adulteration of virgin olive oils and olive oils with hazelnut oil by means of its analysis by a headspace autosampler directly coupled to a mass spectrometer used as detector (ChemSensor). As no chromatographic separation of the individual components of the samples exists, a global signal of the sample is obtained and employed for its characterization by means of chemometric techniques. Four different crude hazelnut oils from Turkey were employed for the development of the method. Multivariate regression techniques (partial least squares and principal components analysis) were applied to generate adequate regression models. Good values were obtained in both techniques for the parameters employed (standard errors of prediction (SEP) and prediction residual error sum of squares (PRESS)) to evaluate its goodness. With the proposed method, minimum adulteration levels of 7 and 15% can be detected in refined and virgin olive oils, respectively. Once validated, the method was applied to the detection of such adulteration in commercial olive oil and virgin olive oil samples.",Journal of chromatography.

N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels reflected dietary intake of seed oils, mayonnaise and biscuits. Alcohol intake was positively associated with palmitic and palmitoleic acid and negatively associated with linoleic acid. These associations suggest indirect relations between alcohol consumption and other features of diet, and also that ethanol has an effect on fat metabolism.

14558129,"The distribution of fatty acids in a triacylglycerol is of great importance from nutritional, biochemical, quality and technological points of view. The ratio of triacylglycerol positional isomers containing two linoleic acid (18:2) and one oleic acid (18:1) moieties--namely, 1(3),2-dilinoleoyl-3(1)-oleoyl glycerol (LLO) and 1,3-dilinoleoyl-2-oleoyl glycerol (LOL)--were quantified in grape seed, olive, pumpkin seed, soybean, sunflower and wheat germ oils by high-performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC/APCI-MS) in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Relative LOL contents (LOL/(LLO+LOL)) of the oils were calculated from the mass abundances of the [LL]+ and [LO]+ diacylglycerol fragment ions ([M+H-RCOOH]+) using a calibration curve. The calibration curve of the relative diacylglycerol mass abundances was measured in SIM mode. The relative LOL contents were found to be relatively consistent for each oil variety. The relative LOL content in grape seed, sunflower, pumpkin seed, soybean and wheat germ oils accounted for 44.2 +/- 2.6, 26.8 +/- 3.2, 16.7 +/- 4.6, 15.9 +/- 2.9 and 13.9 +/- 4.3%, respectively.

HAs are mutagenic/carcinogenic compounds formed at low levels via the Maillard reaction and a free radical mechanism during cooking of animal tissue. The addition of pure antioxidants or foods containing antioxidants has previously been shown to decrease the amount of HAs formed during cooking. In this study, beefburgers were fried in six different oils: refined olive oil, virgin olive oil, virgin olive oil depleted of phenols, rapeseed oil, virgin olive oil with rosemary extract and refined olive oil with rosemary extract. The content of antioxidative compounds in the virgin olive oil and the rosemary extract was determined. The beefburgers were analysed with regards to 12 different HAs by solid phase extraction and HPLC analysis. MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, PhIP, Harman and Norharman were detected in all beefburgers fried in the different oils, but the relative amounts varied. Frying in virgin olive oil reduced the formation of HAs compared with refined olive oil. This effect is probably due to the content of phenols in the virgin olive oil.

Frozen commercially available spinach in New Zealand contains 736.6+/-20.4 mg/100g wet matter (WM) soluble oxalate and 220.1+/-96.5mg/100g WM insoluble oxalate. The frozen spinach contained 90mg total calcium/100g WM, 76.7%of this calcium was unavailable as it was bound to oxalate as insoluble oxalate. The oxalate/calcium (mEq) ratio of the frozen spinach was 4.73. When frozen convenience food is grilled there is no opportunity for the soluble oxalates to be leached out into the cooking water and discarded. Soluble oxalates, when consumed, have the ability to bind to calcium in the spinach and any calcium in foods consumed with the spinach, reducing the absorption of soluble oxalate. In this experiment 10 volunteers ingested 100g grilled spinach alone or with 100g additions of cottage cheese, sour cream and sour cream with Calci-Trim milk (180 g) and finally, with 20g olive oil. The availability of oxalate in the spinach was determined by measuring the oxalate output in the urine over a 6-hour and 24-hour period after intake of the test meal.

The 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxy derivatives of beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol and the 7-keto-beta-sitosterol were the principal phytosterol oxides found in almost all of the oils analyzed. In some oils, the epoxy and dihydroxy derivatives of beta-sitosterol were also found at very low levels. The highest total concentrations of phytosterol oxides, ranging from 4.5 to 67.5 and from 4.1 to 60.1 ppm, were found in sunflower and maize oils, respectively. Lower concentrations were present in the peanut oils, 2.7-9.6 ppm, and in the palm nut oil, 5.5 ppm, whereas in the lampante olive oils, only three samples of the six analyzed contained a low concentration (1.5-2.5 ppm) of oxyphytosterols. No detectable levels of phytosterol oxides were found in the samples of palm and coconut oils. Bleaching experiments were carried out on a sample of sunflower oil at 80 degrees C for 1 h with 1 and 2% of both acidic and neutral earths. The bleaching caused a reduction of the hydroxyphytosterol with partial formation of steroidal hydrocarbons with three double bonds in the ring system at the 2-, 4-, and 6-positions (steratrienes). The same sunflower oil was deodorized at 180 degrees C under vacuum for 1 h, and no dehydration products were formed with a complete recovery of the hydroxyphytosterols. A bleaching test with acidic earths was carried out also with an extra virgin olive oil fortified with 7-keto-cholesterol, dihydroxycholesterol, and alpha-epoxy-cholesterol.

An interesting option for its disposal is the spreading on agricultural land, provided that phytotoxic effects are neutralized. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the potential of an enzyme-based treatment in removing OMW phytotoxicity. To this aim, germinability experiments on durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf. cv. Duilio) were conducted in the presence of different dilutions of raw or enzyme-treated OMW. OMW treatment with laccase resulted in a 65% and 86% reduction in total phenols and ortho-diphenols respectively, due their polymerization as revealed by size-exclusion chromatography. Raw OMW exerted a significant concentration-dependent inhibition on the germinability of durum wheat seeds which was evident up to a dilution rate of 1:8. When the effluent was treated with a fungal laccase, germinability was increased by 57% at a 1:8 dilution and by 94% at a 1:2 dilution, as compared to the same dilutions using untreated OMW. The treatment with laccase also decreased the mean germination time by about 1 day as compared to untreated controls. These results show that germinability inhibition due to OMW can be reduced effectively using fungal laccase, suggesting that phenols are the main determinants of its phytotoxicity.",Chemosphere,"['D003247', 'D005308', 'D019649', 'D005658', 'D018525', 'D042845', 'D000069463', 'D010088', 'D010636', 'D010938', 'D012639', 'D014908', 'D014865']","['Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Fertilizers', 'Food Industry', 'Fungi', 'Germination', 'Laccase', 'Olive Oil', 'Oxidoreductases', 'Phenols', 'Plant Oils', 'Seeds', 'Triticum', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid']",Reduction of the phenolic components in olive-mill wastewater by an enzymatic treatment and its impact on durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) germinability.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000201', None, None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000009', None, 'Q000254', 'Q000254', 'Q000379']","[None, None, None, 'enzymology', None, None, None, 'pharmacology', 'adverse effects', None, 'growth & development', 'growth & development', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531700,2003

Coupling lipases with a wide range of substrates allows the opportunity for synthesis of optically pure pharmaceutical preparations, flavour compounds and other food additives. Affinity chromatography owes its power as a purification method to specific biological interactions. Response-surface analysis was chosen to study column efficiency. This method allows the understanding of interactions between variables with advantages over conventional methods, which involve changing one variable while fixing others at certain levels. The aim of this work was to study the influence of the ratio bed height/column diameter (L/D) and superficial velocity (V) on the column efficiency. The experimental design involved the two variables, L/D (2-10) and v (1-2 cm/min), at five levels. Lipase was obtained from Geotrichum sp. culture in a complex medium composed of 5% corn-steep liquor, 0.5% NH(4)NO(3) and 1% olive oil at 30 degrees C, with 1VVM (air volume/medium volume per min) aeration and 400 rev./min agitation. Maximum lipase activity was 19 units/ml after almost 9 h of fermentation. This lipase could potentially be used in esterification reactions to increase the content of gamma-linolenic acid and to produce bioaromas for food industries. The adsorption assays were carried out in a fixed-bed column with an affinity adsorbent, which was obtained by reaction of a gel with oleic acid as ligand. Breakthrough curves were obtained for all experiments. It has been shown that the lower the values of both L/D and v, the higher the column efficiency (maximum 65.43%). Also, it was observed from the response surface that the efficiency reached a minimum at an L/D of around 8.",Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,"['D000327', 'D002846', 'D005848', 'D007218', 'D008049', 'D019301']","['Adsorption', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Geotrichum', 'Industrial Microbiology', 'Lipase', 'Oleic Acid']",Studies on lipase-affinity adsorption using response-surface analysis.,"[None, 'Q000295', 'Q000378', 'Q000295', 'Q000302', 'Q000378']","[None, 'instrumentation', 'metabolism', 'instrumentation', 'isolation & purification', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11389668,2001

An adulteration of olive oil with a low content (< 5%) of these seed oils (except peanut oil) can be verified by the detection of the increasing levels of trilinolein or tripalmitin in olive oil in which these TG species are normally absent or present at very low levels (< 0.5%). An adulteration with over 20% peanut oil can be detected by the increasing levels of palmitodilinolein. TG species that can be coeluted with trilinolein in the reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) mode are baseline separated by the CGC technique, and their structures are identified by selective ion monitoring mass spectrometry.

10890508,"Off-flavors in foods may originate from environmental pollutants, the growth of microorganisms, oxidation of lipids, or endogenous enzymatic decomposition in the foods. The chromatographic analysis of flavors and off-flavors in foods usually requires that the samples first be processed to remove as many interfering compounds as possible. For analysis of foods by gas chromatography (GC), sample preparation may include mincing, homogenation, centrifugation, distillation, simple solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized-fluid extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, Soxhlet extraction, or methylation. For high-performance liquid chromatography of amines in fish, cheese, sausage and olive oil or aldehydes in fruit juice, sample preparation may include solvent extraction and derivatization. Headspace GC analysis of orange juice, fish, dehydrated potatoes, and milk requires almost no sample preparation. Purge-and-trap GC analysis of dairy products, seafoods, and garlic may require heating, microwave-mediated distillation, purging the sample with inert gases and trapping the analytes with Tenax or C18, thermal desorption, cryofocusing, or elution with ethyl acetate. Solid-phase microextraction GC analysis of spices, milk and fish can involve microwave-mediated distillation, and usually requires adsorption on poly(dimethyl)siloxane or electrodeposition on fibers followed by thermal desorption. For short-path thermal desorption GC analysis of spices, herbs, coffee, peanuts, candy, mushrooms, beverages, olive oil, honey, and milk, samples are placed in a glass-lined stainless steel thermal desorption tube, which is purged with helium and then heated gradually to desorb the volatiles for analysis.

10793856,"Two methods for the determination of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in olive oil were tested and compared. In method A the oil sample was mixed with methanol + water (60 + 40), extracted with hexane and then with chloroform. Chloroform was evaporated and the residue was dissolved with dichloromethane which was then transferred for clean-up onto a silica 'Sep-Pak' cartridge. The cartridge was pre-washed with hexane, ethyl ether and dichloromethane. AFB1 was eluted with chloroform + acetone (9 + 1) and evaporated to dryness. In method B, the oil sample was mixed with methanol + water (80 + 20), shaken and centrifuged. The supernatant was diluted 1:10 with water and 10 ml of the diluted mixture transferred to an 'Aflaprep' immunoaffinity column for the clean-up step. AFB1 was eluted with acetonitrile and evaporated to dryness. AFB1 from both methods was derivatized to its hemiacetal (AFB2a) and then quantitated by HPLC using a C18 (60 A 4.6 x 250 mm) column with fluorescence detection. Both methods are simple, reliable and efficient, but method A showed a lower detection limit (2.8 ng/kg) than method B (56 ng/kg). With a 95% confidence level there was no significant difference in recovery between the two methods, which was 87.2% for method A and 84.8% for method B. In addition, application of a two-tailed F-test to the variances within spiked samples at concentrations 1, 2, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg separately showed that there was no significant difference in the precisions of the two methods. Fifty samples of olive oil of Greek origin produced between 1995 and 1998 were examined with both methods for the presence of AFB1. When analysing the samples with method B, the presence of AFB1 was not detected. The use of method A revealed the presence of AFB1 in 72% of the samples.

All strains investigated by the agar diffusion tests possessed esterase activity and 23 strains were also able to hydrolyse olive oil, but differences in esterase activity were seen. The agar diffusion tests and the titration of FFA showed that the amount of FFA released by a strain of P. roqueforti is determined by both esterase and lipase activity. A large release of FFA was only seen for strains with the ability to hydrolyse both short- and long-chained fatty acids, while strains with esterase activity produced smaller amounts of FFA. Between 7 and 14 days of incubation a steep increase in the release of FFA was observed both by the titration and by GC analysis, and then a decline from 14 to 21 days, probably caused by conversion of FFA to methyl ketones. Identical FFA profiles were found for two strains with different lipolytic activity.

Fume samples from six different commercial cooking oils (safflower, olive, coconut, mustard, vegetable, and corn) frequently used in Taiwan were collected. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were extracted from the air samples and identified by high-performance liquid chromatography and confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Extracts of fumes from safflower oil, vegetable oil, and corn oil contained benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DBahA), benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbFA), and benzo[a]anthracene (BaA). Concentrations of BaP, DbahA, BbFA, and BaA were 2.1, 2.8, 1.8, and 2.5 microg/m3 in fumes from safflower oil; 2.7, 3.2, 2.6, and 2.1 microg/m3 in vegetable oil; and 2.6, 2.4, 2.0, and 1.9 microg/m3 in corn oil, respectively. The authors constructed models to study the efficacy of table-edged fume extractors used commonly by Taiwanese restaurants. Concentrations of BaP were significantly decreased when the fume extractor was working (P<0.05) and the average reduction in percentage was 75%. The other identified PAHs were undetected.

The fruits were crushed and pressed to extract the crude oil, then refined by neutralization, bleaching and deodorization. The crude oil contained 14.1% of the total 14C in the olive fruits. Neutralization resulted in a reduction of 14C by about 50% of the total 14C residues in oil. Bleaching and deodorization processes further reduced the 14C residues and the refined oil contained 31.6% (which corresponds to 4.4% of 14C residues of the total 14C in olive fruits) of the total 14C in the crude oil. Industrially extracted crude oil was fortified with 14C-dimethoate at 1.8 mg kg-1 (0.02 muCi) level and subjected to the same refining process. A sharp decrease in the amount of 14C was observed by neutralization and the amount of 14C remaining in the refined oil was about 7.3% of the total 14C in the crude fortified oil. The data suggest that the 14C residues in the aged and the fortified oil amples were not of the same nature.

Alcohol consumption did not appear to have an effect on the absorption of either 2H5-18:2n-6 or 2H5-18:3n-3 ethyl esters into the circulation after a single oral dose. However, there was a greater enrichment of deuterium in the biosynthesized fatty acids, 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3, in the plasma of the monkeys exposed to alcohol compared to controls.

The coffee lipid extracts were dissolved in olive oil (concentration either 5 mg CTL, 0.5 mg NSM or 0.5 mg DTA per 250 microliters olive oil) in study 1 and in coconut oil (concentration either 20 mg CTL, 2 mg NSM or 2 mg DTA per 250 microliters) in study 2. A dose of 250 microliters of these solutions was administered daily to hamsters by gavage. Control animals received 250 microliters vehicle only. For serum lipid analysis, blood samples were obtained on days 0, 7 and 14 in study 1 and on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 in study 2. Statistical analyses of the data in Study 1 indicated a tendency for serum total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol to increase with administration of CTL, NSM and DTA. In contrast, in study 2 there were no significant differences in serum lipid levels between control and coffee lipid-treated groups across time. In either study, total serum cholesterol levels of the three coffee lipid groups were not significantly different from each other. These results support the concept that coffee lipids may be hypercholesterolaemic and indicate that diterpenes could be the lipid component responsible for such an effect. However, it appears that this hypercholesterolaemic effect is apparent only when the background diet is low in saturated fat and cholesterol.

1493881,"Migration of polyisobutylene from polyethylene/polyisobutylene film into foods has been studied in domestic applications such as wrapping of foods and reheating in a microwave oven. The results of these migration studies were obtained by direct measurement using newly developed analytical methods utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infra-red (IR) spectroscopy as well as predictively from assessment of loss of polyisobutylene from the film. Total levels of polyisobutylene migration into cheese were found to be 8-10 mg/kg, into cake 1-5 mg/kg, and into sandwiches ranged from < 1 to 4 mg/kg. Reheating foods covered with film in the microwave oven, gave migration levels ranging from < 0.01 mg/kg for contact with steam only, up to 0.5 mg/kg for severe splashing of food onto the film and 4 mg/kg for reheated pizza. Migration of polyisobutylene was shown to be skewed towards the low molecular weight fraction of the additive. In typical films, the molecular weight range of polyisobutylene was shown to be 300-6000 daltons (95% limits) centred on 1300 daltons, whereas the additive that had migrated into cheese was found to range from 130-2200 daltons, centred on 520 daltons.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000272', 'D002611', 'D004042', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D008872', 'D008970', 'D000069463', 'D010938', 'D010968', 'D011090', 'D011095', 'D011108', 'D013055']","['Adipates', 'Cheese', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Microwaves', 'Molecular Weight', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Plasticizers', 'Polyenes', 'Polyethylenes', 'Polymers', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared']",Migration of polyisobutylene from polyethylene/polyisobutylene films into foods during domestic and microwave oven use.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1493881,1993

The aim was to evaluate whether a carcinogenic hazard for the general population can derive from the dietary intake of this food, which is consumed particularly highly in the Mediterranean area. The analytical method involved extraction by liquid-liquid partition, filtration on silica gel, clean-up by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel, and analysis by high-resolution gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. The 3- and 4-ring PAHs which are most abundant in the environment were found in all samples, at individual levels up to ca. 40 micrograms/kg (for phenanthrene); no important difference was observed between olive oils and virgin olive oils. PAHs which are most suspected of being carcinogenic for humans were not detected (limit of detection, ca. 3 micrograms/kg).

3745745,"As part of a human diet study, vitamin E activity was estimated in foods used in seven daily menus. Each menu was designed to contain 35% fat calories with either 10 or 30 gm/day of linoleic acid (18:2) and 500 mg/day of cholesterol. To estimate vitamin E activity, each food used in the menus was analyzed for alpha and gamma tocopherol content by high-pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. This article reports the alpha and gamma tocopherol contents of those foods, tocopherol contributions from each food in one sample 2,400-kcal menu, and the mean daily vitamin E activity (milligram alpha tocopherol equivalents) of all seven menus at five caloric levels. Major sources of alpha tocopherol (greater than 10% of the RDA) common to both diets (10 and 30 gm linoleic acid) were olive oil and a few fruits and vegetables. Additional major sources in the 30-gm linoleic acid diets were polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) vegetable oils and margarine. Contrary to a common assumption, increasing the level of PUFA in the menus did not necessarily result in higher milligram equivalents of alpha tocopherol because soybean oil, with a tocopherol composition that is predominantly gamma tocopherol, was the major source of linoleic acid in the diets. Thus, vitamin E activity was not necessarily increased when soybean oil was substituted for a less saturated fat such as olive oil, which has mostly alpha tocopherol.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,"['D002851', 'D005231', 'D005504', 'D019787', 'D008041', 'D009751', 'D014810']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Linoleic Acids', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Vitamin E']",Vitamin E in foods from high and low linoleic acid diets.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3745745,1986
