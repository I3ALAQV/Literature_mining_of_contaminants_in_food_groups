35885397,"Food fraud is a common issue in the modern food industry. The undeclared use of foreign proteins in meat products is a major concern in this context. Oilseeds are ideal for this purpose due to their high protein content and since huge amounts of oil meal are obtained as a by-product of oil production. Therefore, a UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the simultaneous detection of chia, coconut, flaxseed, hemp, peanut, pumpkin, rapeseed, sesame, soy, and sunflower proteins in meat products. Potential tryptic peptide markers were identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry. The final twenty peptide markers selected, which are specific for one of the ten species targeted, were each measured by multiple reaction monitoring. To the best of our knowledge, twelve new heat-stable marker peptides for chia, coconut, flaxseed, pumpkin, rapeseed, sesame and sunflower have not been reported previously. Emulsion-type sausages with 0.01, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00% protein addition by each oilseed species were produced for matrix calibration. No false-positive results were recorded. In the quantification of the ten oilseed species, 466 of 480 measuring data points of the recovery rate in unknown sausages (0.15 and 0.85% protein addition by each oilseed species) were in the accepted range of 80-120%.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Simultaneous Mass Spectrometric Detection of Proteins of Ten Oilseed Species in Meat Products.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35885397,2022

Being an industrially important protein, isolation of new molecules from GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe) strains like mushrooms is the need of the time. In the present work, hydrophobin Vmh3-1 is isolated, purified, and identified from a culture broth and vegetative mycelia of Pleurotus ostreatus grown in a Potato dextrose broth (PDB) in static culture conditions. Purified proteins from the broth and the cell wall showed bands of 11 kDa and 17 kDa when analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Hydrophobin Vmh3-1 was identified in purified protein samples by the Orbitrap-HR-LC-MS/MS analysis with a maximum of 66% sequence coverage. The amphipathic nature of the protein was revealed by an increase in the water contact angle (WCA) of the hydrophilic surface of glass by 87% as well as a decrease in the WCA of the hydrophobic surface of Teflon by 19%.

The other PAHs except fluorene were not observed (detection limit-0.009 µg/g) in all the samples. Among traditional processing techniques, higher PAH contents were observed as a result of frying. Frying with vegetable oil produced higher fluorene content (0.06-0.13 µg/g) in the deep-fried sample, although sesame oil is the best oil which produces lowest PAH contents in fried samples. Among all the processing techniques, lower fluorene (0.01-0.02 µg/g) content was noticed in poaching.

32930255,"Aflatoxins (AFs), as the secondary metabolites of the toxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, are well known to be extremely harmful to humans and animals because of their high toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity. Recurring and increasing studies on AF ingestion incidents indicate that AF contamination is a serious food safety issue worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, the IAC method may be limited to some laboratories because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) clean-up method based on humic acids (HAs), which is followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAs could be directly used as a DSPE sorbent after simple treatment without any chemical modification. In the HA-DSPE, AFs could remain on the HA sorbent by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was retained on HA via only hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix could be sufficiently washed off by n-hexane, whereas the AFs could still be retained on HA; thus, the selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices were achieved. Under the optimal conditions of HA-DSPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.3% to 106.2% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices i.e. blended oil, mixed olive oil, tea oil, sunflower seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, rice oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. Minor matrix effects ranging from 89.3% to 112.9% were obtained for the four AFs, which were acceptable. Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.063 and 0.102 μg kg-1 completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union (EU), China, or other countries. The proposed methodology was further validated using a naturally contaminated peanut oil, and the results indicated that the accuracy of the HA-DSPE could match the accuracy of the referenced IAC. In addition, HA-DSPE can be used to directly treat diluted edible oil without liquid-liquid extraction and HA is cheap and can be easily obtained from the market worldwide; these advantages make the proposed methodology simple, low-cost, and accessible for the determination of AFs in edible oils.",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,"['D000348', 'D001230', 'D001231', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004042', 'D005504', 'D006812', 'D010938', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Aflatoxins', 'Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Humic Substances', 'Plant Oils', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Facile dispersive solid-phase extraction based on humic acid for the determination of aflatoxins in various edible oils.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930255,2021

32028201,"Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces and particles were employed to study effects of polymer materials on linseed oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower seed oil oxidation. The surface types of the materials, hydroperoxide content and volatile in oils were determined by contact angle, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Oils on PP surfaces underwent a more rapid oxidation, followed by PA, PE and PET. Except PP sets, this order was consistent with surface hydrophilicity of polymers.

31413247,"In this study virgin olive oil obtained from cv. Nizip Yaglik (NY) was adulterated with different proportions (5 and 10%, v/v) of cotton (CO) and sunflower (SO) oils. Fatty acid and sterol profiles of olive oil were analyzed by using gas chromatography (GC). Also, difference of Equivalent Carbon Number 42 values (ΔECN42) of oil samples were determined by using GC and HPLC. Due to results of fatty acids analysis, the percentage of oleic acid was decreased when CO and SO were added. Palmitic acid was increased over the addition of CO, and decreased with the addition of SO. The ΔECN42 values were increased in adulterated oils. These values showed further increase in adulterated oils with SO. Beta-sitosterols decreased to 91.06 and 88.54% when mixed with 5 and 10% SO, respectively. On the other hand, decline was negligible when mixed with CO. According to principal component analyses (PCA), pure NY and adulterated oils were clearly separated in different parts of screen plot according to fatty acids, triacylglycerol (TAGs) and sterol profile. The outcomes of this first investigation provide valuable information for about the differences of fatty acids, ΔECN42 values and sterol compounds between Turkish olive oil from Nizip Yaglik cv. and its adulteration with cotton and sunflower oil.

The proposed online assay was validated with good precision, reproducibility, and linearity. Sixteen argan oil samples (100% pure-certified and other commercial argan oils), possible adulterating vegetable oils (i.e., olive, sunflower, corn, and soya oils), and virgin argan oil blended with olive, sunflower, corn, and soya oils at levels of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% were analyzed. Spectrophotometric CUPRAC, DPPH, and ABTS assays were applied. Discrimination of fraudulent argan oils from virgin samples was performed by utilizing orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) regression modeling with good sensitivity and specificity. We suggested [γ-toc/α-toc] value as a new first screening adulteration factor (AF) that could be used to assess fraudulent argan oil samples. The distinct decrement in AF value was observed by the increase of adulteration rate. The AF values for virgin argan oils were ranged from 11.8 (lower limit) to 18.6 (upper limit). The presence of β-sitosterol detected in commercial argan oils (with AF values out of limit values) was evaluated as fraudulent which was in accordance with the proposed assay.

Because the high price of peony seed oil may tempt unscrupulous merchants to dilute it with cheaper substitutes, a rapid detection method for likely adulterants is required. In this study, the fatty acid composition of peony seed oil and four less expensive edible oils (soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, and rapeseed oil) were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Peony oil adulterated by other edible oils was assessed using iodine values to estimate the extent of adulteration. Adulteration was also measured using an electronic nose (E-nose) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Results indicated that peony seed oil was highly enriched in α-linolenic acid. Although the iodine value can be used to detect some adulterants by measuring unsaturation, it was not able to detect all four potential adulterants. In contrast, the E-nose can rapidly identify adulterated peony seed oil by sampling vapor. Data analyses using PCA and LDA show that LDA more effectively clusters the data, discriminates between pure and adulterated oil, and can detect adulteration at the 10% level.

We describe the development of an LC-MS/MS method covering 17 toxins for investigating the natural occurrence of free and modified Alternaria toxins in tomato sauce, sunflower seed oil, and wheat flour. Target analytes included alternariol (AOH), AOH-3-glucoside, AOH-9-glucoside, AOH-3-sulfate, alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), AME-3-glucoside, AME-3-sulfate, altenuene, isoaltenuene, tenuazonic acid (TeA), tentoxin (TEN), altertoxin I and II, alterperylenol, stemphyltoxin III, altenusin, and altenuic acid III. Extensive optimization resulted in a time- and cost-effective sample preparation protocol and a chromatographic baseline separation of included isomers. Overall, adequate limits of detection (0.03-9 ng/g) and quantitation (0.6-18 ng/g), intermediate precision (9-44%), and relative recovery values (75-100%) were achieved. However, stemphyltoxin III, AOH-3-sulfate, AME-3-sulfate, altenusin, and altenuic acid III showed recoveries in wheat flour below 70%, while their performance was stable and reproducible. Our pilot study with samples from the Austrian retail market demonstrated that tomato sauces (n = 12) contained AOH, AME, TeA, and TEN in concentrations up to 20, 4, 322, and 0.6 ng/g, while sunflower seed oil (n = 7) and wheat flour samples (n = 9) were contaminated at comparatively lower levels. Interestingly and of relevance for risk assessment, AOH-9-glucoside, discovered for the first time in naturally contaminated food items, and AME-3-sulfate were found in concentrations similar to their parent toxins.

Analysis of thermal decomposition and changes during refining suggested that these naturally present organochlorine compounds in palm oils and perhaps in other vegetable oils are precursors of 3-MCPD esters.

Sample preparation is based on three steps including saponification, liquid-liquid partitioning and, finally, clean-up by solid phase extraction on 2 g of silica. Guidance on single-laboratory validation of the proposed analysis method was taken from the second edition of the Eurachem guide on method validation. The lower level of the working range of the method was determined by the limits of quantification of the individual analytes, and the upper level was equal to 5.0 µg kg(-1). The limits of detection and quantification of the four PAHs ranged from 0.06 to 0.12 µg kg(-1) and from 0.13 to 0.24 µg kg(-1). Recoveries of more than 84.8% were achieved for all four PAHs at two concentration levels (2.5 and 5.0 µg kg(-1)), and expanded relative measurement uncertainties were below 20%. The performance of the validated method was in all aspects compliant with provisions set in European Union legislation for the performance of analytical methods employed in the official control of food.

26601590,"Direct comparison of cow and goat performance and milk fatty acid responses to diets known to induce milk fat depression (MFD) in the bovine reveals relevant species-by-diet interactions in ruminal lipid metabolism. Thus, this study was conducted to infer potential mechanisms responsible for differences in the rumen microbial biohydrogenation (BH) due to diet and ruminant species. To meet this objective, 12 cows and 15 goats were fed a basal diet (control), a similar diet supplemented with 2.2% fish oil (FO), or a diet containing 5.3% sunflower oil and additional starch (+38%; SOS) according to a 3 × 3 Latin square design with 25-d experimental periods. On the last day of each period, fatty acid composition (by gas chromatography) and bacterial community (by terminal-RFLP), as well as fermentation characteristics, were measured in rumen fluid samples. Results showed significant differences in the response of cows and goats to dietary treatments, although variations in some fermentation parameters (e.g., decreases in the acetate-to-propionate ratio due to FO or SOS) were similar in both species. Main alterations in ruminal BH pathways potentially responsible for MFD on the SOS diet (i.e., the shift from trans-11 to trans-10 18:1 and related increases in trans-10,cis-12 18:2) tended to be more pronounced in cows, which is consistent with an associated MFD only in this species. However, changes linked to FO-induced MFD (e.g., decreases in 18:0 and increases in total trans-18:1) were stronger in caprine rumen fluid, which may explain their unexpected susceptibility (although less marked than in bovine) to the negative effect of FO on milk fat content. Altogether, these results suggest that distinct ruminal mechanisms lead to each type of diet-induced MFD and confirm a pronounced interaction with species. With regard to microbiota, differences between cows and goats in the composition of the rumen bacterial community might be behind the disparity in the microorganisms affected by the experimental diets (e.g., Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Succinivibrionaceae in the bovine, and Pseudobutryrivibrio, Clostridium cluster IV, Prevotella, and Veillonellaceae in the caprine), which hindered the assignation of bacterial populations to particular BH steps or pathways. Furthermore, most relevant variations in microbial groups corresponded to as yet uncultured bacteria and suggest that these microorganisms may play a predominant role in the ruminal lipid metabolism in both cows and goats.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D004032', 'D004042', 'D019587', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D005395', 'D006041', 'D050356', 'D008892', 'D010938', 'D012417', 'D013213', 'D000074242']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Fish Oils', 'Goats', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Milk', 'Plant Oils', 'Rumen', 'Starch', 'Sunflower Oil']","Comparison of ruminal lipid metabolism in dairy cows and goats fed diets supplemented with starch, plant oil, or fish oil.","[None, 'Q000502', 'Q000662', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None]","[None, 'physiology', 'veterinary', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26601590,2016

VUV detection features full spectral acquisition in a wavelength range of 115-240nm, where virtually all chemical species absorb. VUV absorption spectra of 37 FAMEs, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated types were recorded. Unsaturated FAMEs show significantly different gas phase absorption profiles than saturated ones, and these classes can be easily distinguished with the VUV detector. Another advantage includes differentiating cis/trans-isomeric FAMEs (e.g. oleic acid methyl ester and linoleic acid methyl ester isomers) and the ability to use VUV data analysis software for deconvolution of co-eluting signals. As a universal detector, VUV also provides high specificity, sensitivity, and a fast data acquisition rate, making it a powerful tool for fatty acid screening when combined with gas chromatography.

Thermal processing changes the properties of edible oils and can also modify their metabolism, for example, eicosanoids formation. The aim of our study was to verify whether the activity of desaturases can be modified by lipids intake, especially by the fatty acids content. The experimental diets contained rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, and olive oil, both unheated and heated (for 10 minutes at 200 °C each time before administration), and influenced the fatty acids composition in serum and the activity of enzymes participating in arachidonic acid (AA) formation. The activity of desaturases was determined by measuring the amounts of AA formed in vitro derived from linoleic acid as determined in liver microsomes of Wistar rats. In addition, the indices of ∆(6)-desaturase (D6D) and ∆(5)-desaturase (D5D) have been determined. To realize this aim, the method of high-performance liquid chromatography has been used with ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry detection. Diet supplementation with the oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids affects the fatty acids profile in blood serum and the activity of D6D and ∆(5)-desaturase in rat liver microsomes, the above activities being dependent on the kind of oil applied. Diet supplementation with heated oils has been found to increase the amount of AA produced in hepatic microsomes; and in the case of rapeseed oil and sunflower oil, it has also increased D6D activity.","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)","['D000818', 'D016718', 'D002851', 'D000090943', 'D004032', 'D044943', 'D005227', 'D005229', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D019787', 'D050602', 'D008862', 'D010938', 'D000074262', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D000074242']","['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Delta-5 Fatty Acid Desaturase', 'Diet', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Linoleoyl-CoA Desaturase', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Plant Oils', 'Rapeseed Oil', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sunflower Oil']",Heating of vegetable oils influences the activity of enzymes participating in arachidonic acid formation in Wistar rats.,"[None, 'Q000096', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000201', 'Q000008', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'blood', None, 'methods', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'enzymology', 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26094213,2016

These surface active agents have several applications in agriculture, oil processing, food, and pharmaceutical industries. In this research using YMG and YUG culture media, a native yeast strain, HG5, was isolated from honey bee. The oil spread test as a screening method was used to evaluate biosurfactant production by the yeast HG5 isolate. The 5.8s-rDNA analysis confirmed that the isolated yeast was related to Lachancea thermotolerans. We named this strain Lachancea thermotolerans strain BBMCZ7FA20 and its 5.8s-rDNA sequence was deposited in GenBank, NCBI under accession number of KM042082.1. The best precursor of biosurfactant production was canola oil and the sophorolipid amount was measured for 24.2 g/l. The thin layer chromatography and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis showed that the extracted biosurfactant from Lachancea thermotolerans was sophorolipid. In conclusion, this is the first report of sophorolipid production by a native yeast Lachancea thermotolerans BBMCZ7FA20 we isolated from the honey bee gut collected from an apiary farm in Saman, Chaharmahal Bakhtiari province, Iran.

23461409,"Application of the aroma extract dilution analysis on a distillate prepared from an authentic Styrian pumpkin seed oil followed by identification experiments led to the characterization of 47 odor-active compounds in the flavor dilution (FD) factor range of 8-8192 among which 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (roasty, popcorn-like), 2-propionyl-1-pyrroline (roasty, popcorn-like), 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (clove-like), and phenylacetaldehyde (honey-like) showed the highest FD factors. Among the set of key odorants, 2-propionyl-1-pyrroline and another 20 odorants were identified for the first time as constituents of pumpkin seed oil. To evaluate the aroma contribution in more detail, 31 aroma compounds showing the highest FD factors were quantitated by means of stable isotope dilution assays. On the basis of the quantitative data and odor thresholds determined in sunflower oil, odor activity values (OAV; ratio of concentration to odor threshold) were calculated, and 26 aroma compounds were found to have an OAV above 1. Among them, methanethiol (sulfury), 2-methylbutanal (malty), 3-methylbutanal (malty), and 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine (roasted potato) reached the highest OAVs. Sensory evaluation of an aroma recombinate prepared by mixing the 31 key odorants in the concentrations as determined in the oil revealed that the aroma of Styrian pumpkin seed oil could be closely mimicked.

23031667,"Producing organic fish diets requires that the use of both fishmeal and fish oil (FO) be minimized and replaced by sustainable, organic sources. The purpose of the present study was to replace FO with organic oils and evaluate the effects on feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR), daily specific growth rate (SGR) and nutrient digestibility in diets in which fishmeal protein was partly substituted by organic plant protein concentrates. It is prohibited to add antioxidants to organic oils, and therefore the effects of force-oxidizing the oils (including FO) on feed intake and nutrient digestibility was furthermore examined. Four organic oils with either a relatively high or low content of polyunsaturated fatty acids were considered: linseed oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil and grapeseed oil. Substituting FO with organic oils did not affect feed intake (P > 0.05), FCR or SGR (P > 0.05) despite very different dietary fatty acid profiles. All organic plant oils had a positive effect on apparent lipid digestibility compared with the FO diet (P < 0.05), whereas there were no effects on the apparent digestibility of other macronutrients when compared with the FO diet (P > 0.05). Organic vegetable oils did not undergo auto-oxidation as opposed to the FO, and the FO diet consequently had a significantly negative effect on the apparent lipid digestibility. Feed intake was not affected by oxidation of any oils. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that it is possible to fully substitute FO with plant-based organic oils without negatively affecting nutrient digestibility and growth performance. Furthermore, plant-based organic oils are less likely to oxidize than FOs, prolonging the shelf life of such organic diets.",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,"['D000704', 'D000821', 'D000824', 'D000818', 'D017756', 'D002849', 'D004063', 'D004435', 'D017686', 'D010084', 'D010938']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animal Feed', 'Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Aquaculture', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Digestion', 'Eating', 'Oncorhynchus mykiss', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plant Oils']",Effects of organic plant oils and role of oxidation on nutrient utilization in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000502', 'Q000254', None, 'Q000378']","[None, 'analysis', 'drug effects', None, 'methods', None, 'drug effects', 'physiology', 'growth & development', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23031667,2013
23010246,"This study addresses a current trend in chemical food safety control represented by an effort to integrate analyses of various groups of food contaminants/toxicants into a single, high-throughput method. The choice of optimal sample preparation step is one of the key conditions to achieve good performance characteristics. In this context, we investigated the possibility to expand the scope of the three multi-analyte extraction procedures employed earlier in other studies for rapid isolation of either pesticides or mycotoxins from plant matrices. Following procedures were tested: A - aqueous acetonitrile extraction followed by partition (QuEChERS-like method), B - aqueous acetonitrile extraction, and C - pure acetonitrile extraction. On the list of target analytes, we had 288 pesticides (including 'troublesome' acidic, basic and base-sensitive compounds) together with 38 mycotoxins (including all EU regulated ones and many 'emerging' toxins on the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) list). The matrices selected for the experiments, apple baby food, wheat flour, spices and sunflower seeds, represented various composition categories in terms of moisture, fat and extractable compounds (e.g. pigments and essential oils) content. In preliminary experiments, acceptable recoveries (70-120%) for most of analytes were obtained by the analysis of spiked matrices, regardless which extraction procedure was used. However, when analysing dry samples with incurred pesticide residues/mycotoxins, the method C did not enable efficient extraction of some common contaminants. Procedure A, thanks to a higher matrix equivalent compared to the method B and relatively less pronounced matrix effects, enabled lower quantification limits for all analyte/matrix combinations, with the exception of polar mycotoxins and/or pesticides. Higher recoveries for the latter group of analytes could be achieved by the method B; on the other hand, extraction efficiency of non-polar pesticides from fatty matrix was rather poor by this method.",Journal of chromatography.

The 68 PRs include 27 kinds of organophosphorus, 23 organic chlorines, 11 synthetic pyrethroids, and 7 carbamates. Heptachlor epoxide was used as the internal standard. Aminopropyl silica was chosen as the dispersion sorbent of the oil-absorbing matrix solid-phase dispersion extraction and was applied to capture hydrophobic components from high oil samples. A 35-min orthogonal separation was performed by using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry with a nonpolar-polar column set. Identification of 68 PRs in the extract was finished by using the time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the assistance of an automated peak-find and spectral deconvolution software. A screening based on control design was introduced and explained. This screening method considerably reduced the cost for the quantitative and confirmatory analyses.

22542286,"The present contribution describes an investigation directed towards the use of a rapid heart-cutting multidimensional LC-GC-FID method for the analysis of mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH), contained in different types of homogenized solid baby food (fish, meat and fruit products). The fish and meat products all contained vegetable oil (sunflower), potentially an important source of mineral-oil contamination. Sixteen commercial baby food samples were subjected to analysis, with various degrees of MOSH contamination (from 0.3mg/kg to circa 14 mg/kg) found. Hence, MOSH contamination was found not only in the meat and fish products, but also in the fruit ones. A fruit-based baby food was lab-made, using the ingredients reported on the commercial product, and was found to be contaminated. The single ingredients were then subjected to LC-GC analysis, with corn starch and sugar found to be the source of contamination. For confirmation of the analytical findings, three of the sixteen samples were analyzed in two separate laboratories, using two distinct LC-GC methods, based on different interfaces. The results were confirmed, in qualitative terms, by collecting the LC fractions, relative to some of the food samples, and subjecting them to comprehensive two-dimensional GC-quadrupole mass spectrometry.

From the analytical viewpoint, the whole procedure relies only on the results of the determination of the triacylglycerol profile of the oils by high temperature gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The chromatographic profiles were pre-treated (baseline correction, peak alignment using iCoshift algorithm and mean centering) before building the models. At first, a class-modeling approach, Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) was used to identify the vegetable oil used blending. Successively, a separate calibration model for each kind of blending was built using Partial Least Square (PLS). The correlation coefficients of actual versus predicted concentrations resulting from multivariate calibration models were between 0.95 and 0.99. In addition, Genetic algorithms (GA-PLS), were used, as variable selection method, to improve the models which yielded R(2) values higher than 0.90 for calibration set. This model had a better predictive ability than the PLS without feature selection.

The whole-body fatty acid balance method demonstrated a clear trend of progressively reduced fatty acid bioconversion activity along the n-3 and n-6 pathways, up to the production of 20:5n-3 and 20:4n-6, respectively. This suggests that the pathway exhibits a ""funnel like"" progression of activity rather than the existence of a single rate limiting step. The production of 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 was more active than that of 20:5n-3. However, despite this trend in reduced apparent in vivo net enzyme activity, the efficiency of the various bioconversion steps (measured as % of bioconverted substrate) confirmed an opposing trend.

FAAS was used to determine the Na, K, Ca, Mg, Zn and Fe levels in the samples, while GFAAS was used for quantifying Cr, Ni, As, Pb, Cd, Cu and Mn, as these elements appeared in the samples at much lower concentrations. Tween-80 and Triton X-100 were employed as surfactants, and emulsions were prepared by a conventional method that involved heating and mixing of the constituents. Complete stabilisation was achieved through magnetic stirring for 15 min at room temperature. The evaluated figures of merit were linearity, accuracy and sensitivity, which were determined by the characteristic concentration and mass. Analysis of spiked samples demonstrated accuracy, which ranged from 90% (Na) to 112% (Fe) for FAAS and from 83% (Cd) to 121% (Pb) for GFAAS measurements. Atomic absorption spectrometry proved to be a promising approach for the analysis of metals in emulsified edible oils and fats.

20112157,"From times immemorial, colorants, and flavorings have been used in foods. Color and flavor are the major attributes to the quality of a food product, affecting the appearance and acceptance of the product. As a consequence of the increased demand of natural flavoring and colorant from industries, there is a renewed interest in the research on the composition and recovery of natural food flavors and colors. Over the years, numerous procedures have been proposed for the isolation of aromatic compounds and colors from plant materials. Generally, the methods of extraction followed for aroma and pigment from plant materials are solvent extraction, hydro-distillation, steam distillation, and super critical carbon dioxide extraction. The application of enzymes in the extraction of oil from oil seeds like sunflower, corn, coconut, olives, avocado etc. are reported in literature. There is a great potential for this enzyme-based extraction technology with the selection of appropriate enzymes with optimized operating conditions. Various enzyme combinations are used to loosen the structural integrity of botanical material thereby enhancing the extraction of the desired flavor and color components. Recently enzymes have been used for the extraction of flavor and color from plant materials, as a pre-treatment of the raw material before subjecting the plant material to hydro distillation/solvent extraction. A deep knowledge of enzymes, their mode of action, conditions for optimum activity, and selection of the right type of enzymes are essential to use them effectively for extraction. Although the enzyme hydrolases such as lipases, proteases (chymotrypsin, subtilisin, thermolysin, and papain), esterases use water as a substrate for the reaction, they are also able to accept other nucleophiles such as alcohols, amines, thio-esters, and oximes.

Carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was detected in 43% of the samples analyzed. Benz[a]anthracene and chrysene were detected in 37 and 45% of the samples, respectively, that did not contain BaP. Of the individual non-carcinogenic PAHs, naphthalene showed the highest mean concentration (14 microg kg(-1)), while for the carcinogenic PAHs, BaP (0.92 microg kg(-1)) and chrysene (0.87 microg kg(-1)) showed the highest mean values. Approximately 20% of the samples within the olive oil and cooking oil sub-categories exceeded the EU maximum tolerable limit for BaP, with the highest level of 6.77 and 11.1 microg kg(-1), respectively. For the fat sub-category, 9% of the samples exceeded the tolerance limit, with the highest level of 3.67 microg kg(-1).

19994891,"An increasing number of severe food borne intoxications are caused by a highly stable depsipeptide, named cereulide, which is produced by emetic Bacillus cereus strains. As cereulide poses a health risk to humans, the development of an appropriate method for the analysis of this toxin is mandatory. Therefore, the reference material of cereulide as well as its (13)C(6)-isotopologue was prepared by means of a biosynthetic approach using a B. cereus culture, followed by a rapid but efficient downstream purification. After structure confirmation by means of liquid chromatography (LC)-time-of-flight mass spectrometry, LC-tandem mass spectrometry, and one-/two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, a stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) was developed for the quantification of cereulide in foods using the (13)C(6)-cereulide as the internal standard. Validation experiments were performed, and the data were compared to the quantitative analysis using the structurally related valinomycin instead of the (13)C(6)-cereulide as an internal standard. Trueness, repeatability, and reproducibility expressed as relative standard deviation showed values <10 or <8% for valinomycin or <8% for (13)C(6)-cereulide, respectively. Furthermore, the MS response of the valinomycin was found to be significantly influenced by the food matrix, thus leading to rather low recovery rates of 91% from boiled rice and 80% from boiled rice supplemented with 10% sunflower oil. In comparison, the use of (13)C(6)-cereulide as an internal standard gave good recovery rates of 104 and 111% from both matrices, thus demonstrating the robustness and accuracy of the developed SIDA.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001409', 'D001427', 'D002247', 'D047630', 'D005506', 'D007553']","['Bacillus cereus', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Depsipeptides', 'Food Contamination', 'Isotope Labeling']",Development of a stable isotope dilution analysis for the quantification of the Bacillus cereus toxin cereulide in foods.,"['Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19994891,2010

The only data required for this method are the results obtained from an analysis of the lipid fraction by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total number of 566 samples (pure oils and samples of adulterated olive oil) were used to develop the chemometric models, which were designed to accomplish, step-by-step, the three aims of the method: to detect whether an olive oil sample is adulterated, to identify the type of adulterant used in the fraud, and to determine how much aldulterant is in the sample. Qualitative analysis was carried out via two chemometric approaches--soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) and K nearest neighbours (KNN)--both approaches exhibited prediction abilities that were always higher than 91% for adulterant detection and 88% for type of adulterant identification. Quantitative analysis was based on partial least squares regression (PLSR), which yielded R2 values of >0.90 for calibration and validation sets and thus made it possible to determine adulteration with excellent precision according to the Shenk criteria.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002845', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D000069463', 'D010938']","['Chromatography', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils']","Sequential (step-by-step) detection, identification and quantitation of extra virgin olive oil adulteration by chemometric treatment of chromatographic profiles.","['Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","['methods', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17611742,2007
17487605,"A protocol for the measurement of 27 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in vegetable oils by GC/MS has undergone single-laboratory validation. PAHs were measured in three oils (olive pomace, sunflower and coconut oil). Five samples of each oil (one unfortified, and four fortified at concentrations between 2 and 50 microg kg(-1)) were analysed in replicate (four times in separate runs). Two samples (one unfortified and one fortified at 2 microg kg(-1)) of five oils (virgin olive oil, grapeseed oil, toasted sesame oil, olive margarine and palm oil) were also analysed. The validation included an assessment of measurement bias from the results of 120 measurements of a certified reference material (coconut oil BCR CRM458 certified for six PAHs). The method is capable of reliably detecting 26 out of 27 PAHs, at concentration <2 microg kg(-1) which is the European Union maximum limit for benzo[a]pyrene, in vegetable oils, olive pomace oil, sunflower oil and coconut oil. Quantitative results were obtained that are fit for purpose for concentrations from <2 to 50 microg kg(-1) for 24 out of 27 PAHs in olive pomace oil, sunflower oil and coconut oil. The reliable detection of 2 microg kg(-1) of PAHs in five additional oils (virgin olive oil, grapeseed oil, toasted sesame oil, olive margarine and palm oil) has been demonstrated. The method failed to produce fit-for-purpose results for the measurement of dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, anthanthrene and cyclopenta[c,d]pyrene. The reason for the failure was the large variation in results.

16637674,"Ethyl esters (FAEE) and trideuterium-labeled methyl esters (d3-FAME) of fatty acids were prepared and investigated regarding their suitability as internal standards (IS) for the determination of fatty acids as methyl esters (FAME). On CP-Sil 88, ethyl esters of odd-numbered fatty acids eluted approximately 0.5 min after the respective FAME, and only coelutions with minor FAME were observed. Depending on the problem, one or even many FAEE can be added as IS for the quantification of FAME by both GC-FID and GC-MS. By contrast, d3-FAME coeluted with FAME on the polar GC column, and the use of the former as IS requires application of GC-MS. In the SIM mode, m/z 77 and 90 are suggested for d3-methyl esters of saturated fatty acids, whereas m/z 88 and 101 are recommended for ethyl esters of saturated fatty acids. These m/z values give either no or very low response for FAME and can thus be used for the analysis of FAME in food by GC-MS in the SIM mode. Fatty acids in sunflower oil and mozzarella cheese were quantified using five saturated FAEE as IS. Gravimetric studies showed that the transesterification procedure could be carried out without of loss of fatty acids. GC-EI/MS full scan analysis was suitable for the quantitative determination of all unsaturated fatty acids in both food samples, whereas GC-EI/MS in the SIM mode was particularly valuable for quantifying minor fatty acids. The novel GC-EI/MS/SIM method using fatty acid ethyl esters as internal standards can be used to quantify individual fatty acids only, that is, without determination of all fatty acids (the common 100% method), although this is present.

16541407,"The recently introduced technique of an atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) source coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QqTOFMS) has been applied to fast olive oil fingerprinting on the basis of the accurate mass measurements obtained with this instrumentation. The key compounds can be characterized as [M+H]+ (produced by proton transfer) or as [M]+* (by charge transfer) ions in the mass spectra. [M+H]+ ions, however, show higher abundance, especially for triacylglycerols. Other ions present in APPI-MS are the acylium ion [RiCO]+ and [RiCO-H2O]+. This latter ion is absent in the electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS spectra, and this represents valuable complementary information. Several critical parameters in the APPI source were optimized such as LC eluent composition, ion spray voltage and, especially, declustering potential. APPI-QqTOFMS allows easy discrimination among different edible oils: olive, extra virgin olive, olive-pomace, hazelnut, sunflower, corn and several mixed oils, with high throughput (approximately 1 min per sample). Cluster analysis was applied to obtain the best experimental conditions for oil discrimination on the basis of declustering potential.

16428640,"Based on the potential benefits of cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) for human health, there is a need to develop effective strategies for enhancing milk fat CLA concentrations. Levels of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk can be increased by supplements of fish oil (FO) and sunflower oil (SO), but there is considerable variation in the response. Part of this variance may reflect time-dependent ruminal adaptations to high levels of lipid in the diet, which lead to alterations in the formation of specific biohydrogenation intermediates. To test this hypothesis, 16 late lactation Holstein-British Friesian cows were used in a repeated measures randomized block design to examine milk fatty acid composition responses to FO and SO in the diet over a 28-d period. Cows were allocated at random to corn silage-based rations (8 per treatment) containing 0 (control) or 45 g of oil supplement/kg of dry matter consisting (1:2; wt/wt) of FO and SO (FSO), and milk composition was determined on alternate days from d 1. Compared with the control, the FSO diet decreased mean dry matter intake (21.1 vs. 17.9 kg/d), milk fat (47.7 vs. 32.6 g/kg), and protein content (36.1 vs. 33.3 g/kg), but had no effect on milk yield (27.1 vs. 26.4 kg/d). Reductions in milk fat content relative to the FSO diet were associated with increases in milk trans-10 18:1, trans-10, cis-12 CLA, and trans-9, cis-11 CLA concentrations (r(2) = 0.74, 0.57, and 0.80, respectively). Compared with the control, the FSO diet reduced milk 4:0 to 18:0 and cis 18:1 content and increased trans 18:1, trans 18:2, cis-9, trans-11 CLA, 20:5 n-3, and 22:6 n-3 concentrations. The FSO diet caused a rapid elevation in milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, reaching a maximum of 5.37 g/100 g of fatty acids on d 5, but these increases were transient, declining to 2.35 g/100 g of fatty acids by d 15. They remained relatively constant thereafter. Even though concentrations of trans-11 18:1 followed the same pattern of temporal changes as cis-9, trans-11 CLA, the total trans 18:1 content of FSO milk was unchanged because of the concomitant increases in the concentration of other isomers (Delta(4-10) and Delta(12-15)), predominantely trans-10 18:1. In conclusion, supplementing diets with FSO enhances milk fat cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, but the high level of enrichment declines because of changes in ruminal biohydrogenation that result in trans-10 replacing trans-11 as the major 18:1 biohydrogenation intermediate formed in the rumen.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000824', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D004032', 'D005223', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D005395', 'D008401', 'D006865', 'D044243', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D010938', 'D012417', 'D012820', 'D000074242', 'D003313']","['Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Diet', 'Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Fish Oils', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrogenation', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Plant Oils', 'Rumen', 'Silage', 'Sunflower Oil', 'Zea mays']",Examination of the persistency of milk fatty acid composition responses to fish oil and sunflower oil in the diet of dairy cows.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000008', 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428640,2006

15081990,"It has been known for a long time that both the crystal structure and kinetics of crystallisation can be affected by ultrasound. In the past systems used have relied on high power ultrasonic probes to produce crystals. The majority of these probes produce cavitation in the system and it has been difficult to differentiate between effects caused by the ultrasound alone or by the cavitation produced by ultrasound on the crystal structure. Some materials, such as fats, are very susceptible to the production of free radicals that lead to ""off-flavours"" being obtained. These ""off-flavours"" are easily produced when the standard high power probes are used. This has meant that, although the crystal structure of the final product might be improved, the presence of 'off' flavours has prevented ultrasound being considered as a commercial technique for the crystallisation of edible fats. At Unilever R&D a system has been developed which can investigate the effect of ultrasound on the crystallisation of fats under controlled conditions covering a range of intensities and cooling rates. The intensity levels used were both below and above the cavitational threshold. By keeping the cooling regime constant it has been possible to show that the structure of the final product can vary from a material looking similar to cottage cheese through to a fine cream simply by varying the ultrasonic intensity.

15030196,"In this work the quantitative determination and analytical speciation of arsenic were undertaken in different types of nuts, randomly purchased from local markets. The hardness of the whole nuts and high lipid content made the preparation of this material difficult for analysis. The lack of sample homogeneity caused irreproducible results. To improve the precision of analysis, arsenic was determined separately in nut oil and in the defatted sample. The lipids were extracted from the ground sample with the two portions of a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1). The defatted material was dried and ground again, yielding a fine powder. The nut oil was obtained by combining the two organic extracts and by evaporating the solvents. The two nut fractions were microwave digested, and total arsenic was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results obtained for oils from different types of nuts showed element concentration in the range 2.9-16.9 ng g(-)(1). Lower levels of arsenic were found in defatted material (<0.1 ng g(-)(1) with the exception of Brazil nuts purchased with and without shells, 3.0 and 2.8 ng g(-)(1) respectively). For speciation analysis of arsenic in nut oils, elemental species were extracted from 2 g of oil with 12 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 8 mL of deionized water. The aqueous layer, containing polar arsenic species, was evaporated and the residue dissolved and analyzed by ion chromatography-ICP-MS. The anion exchange chromatography enabled separation of As(III), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAs(V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAs(V)), and As(V) within 8 min. Several types of nuts were analyzed, including walnuts, Brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, pine nuts, peanuts, pistachio nuts, and sunflower seeds. The recovery for the speciation procedure was in the range 72.7-90.6%. The primary species found in the oil extracts were As(III) and As(V).

The analytical techniques used were silica gel column chromatography and high-performance size exclusion chromatography. The decrease in ox-TG during refining (42.3% on average) was accompanied by an increase in triglyceride oligopolymers (TGP). The inverse correlation between the two lipid groups suggests that the decrease in ox-TG during refining was due in part to the occurrence of polymerization reactions. An inverse correlation was also found between the percentage sum of ox-TG + TGP and percent TGP, indicating that a part of the ox-TG also underwent degradation or transformation reactions.

The 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxy derivatives of beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol and the 7-keto-beta-sitosterol were the principal phytosterol oxides found in almost all of the oils analyzed. In some oils, the epoxy and dihydroxy derivatives of beta-sitosterol were also found at very low levels. The highest total concentrations of phytosterol oxides, ranging from 4.5 to 67.5 and from 4.1 to 60.1 ppm, were found in sunflower and maize oils, respectively. Lower concentrations were present in the peanut oils, 2.7-9.6 ppm, and in the palm nut oil, 5.5 ppm, whereas in the lampante olive oils, only three samples of the six analyzed contained a low concentration (1.5-2.5 ppm) of oxyphytosterols. No detectable levels of phytosterol oxides were found in the samples of palm and coconut oils. Bleaching experiments were carried out on a sample of sunflower oil at 80 degrees C for 1 h with 1 and 2% of both acidic and neutral earths. The bleaching caused a reduction of the hydroxyphytosterol with partial formation of steroidal hydrocarbons with three double bonds in the ring system at the 2-, 4-, and 6-positions (steratrienes). The same sunflower oil was deodorized at 180 degrees C under vacuum for 1 h, and no dehydration products were formed with a complete recovery of the hydroxyphytosterols. A bleaching test with acidic earths was carried out also with an extra virgin olive oil fortified with 7-keto-cholesterol, dihydroxycholesterol, and alpha-epoxy-cholesterol.

The objective of the present study was to measure the in vitro accessibility (available for absorption) of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene in vegetable relishes prepared with or without oil. Derived results were used to calculate the contribution of vegetable relish to recommended daily intake of retinol. Five sundried green leafy vegetables from Tanzania were cooked without oil, with sunflower oil or with red palm oil. The total amount and in vitro accessibility of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene from a portion (100 g) of vegetable relish was determined. The in vitro method used simulated the digestion process in the gastrointestinal tract. Carotenoids released after digestion were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The total amount of beta-carotene varied between 1211 and 3659 microg/100 g among the five vegetable sources studied. From green leaves cooked without oil, 8-29% of the beta-carotene content became accessible after in vitro digestion and 39-94% from leaves cooked with sunflower oil or red palm oil. Adding red palm oil instead of sunflower oil resulted in about twice as much accessible beta-carotene, due to the high accessibility of its beta-carotene content. The red palm oil contributed also a considerable amount of alpha-carotene. The results showed that by eating vegetable relishes with added oil daily, it should be possible to provide the recommended intake level of vitamin A.",International journal of food sciences and nutrition,"['D000042', 'D001682', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D004032', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D006801', 'D018515', 'D010938', 'D000074242', 'D013636', 'D014675', 'D014801', 'D019207']","['Absorption', 'Biological Availability', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diet', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Oils', 'Sunflower Oil', 'Tanzania', 'Vegetables', 'Vitamin A', 'beta Carotene']",In vitro accessibility of carotenes from green leafy vegetables cooked with sunflower oil or red palm oil.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000008', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'administration & dosage', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12590739,2003

The first experiment was designed to test 2 sources of dietary fat and 3 levels of dietary energy using a factorial (2x3) experimental design. The foods were formulated to maintain a constant ratio of energy to protein (and other nutrients). There were no significant differences in weight gain, intake, final body weight or food to gain ratio between broilers fed on diets differing solely in the degree of fat saturation. Broilers fed on diets containing animal fat showed higher whole-body fat retention (P=0.02) and lower protein accretion (P=0.03) than those fed on diets containing vegetable oils. 3. In the second experiment, only 1 concentration of fat (tallow, lard or sunflower oil) was incorporated into the experimental diets, providing different energy to protein ratios. The carcase protein content was not affected by dietary fat source, while total fat accretion (P=0.01) and energy retention (P=0.14) were highest in broilers fed on a diet containing tallow. 4.

Although food intake was similar in both experimental groups, final body weight, body weight gain, food efficiency ratio and protein efficiency ratio were significantly lower in group 2. The increase of the hepatosomatic index in rats of group 2 seems related to a higher ingestion of potential toxic components (dimers and polymers of triglycerides and oxidized triglycerides) by this group. The livers of nine out of the 10 animals studied also showed moderate fibrotic degenerative areas with severe vacuolization, together with regenerative areas containing eosinophilic binuclear hepatocytes. In addition, livers of group 2 animals showed a 12% higher content of arachidonic acid. Data suggest that higher arachidonic acid levels would be needed for regeneration to palliate liver injury.

2487030,"The results of the chemical composition and biological quality of deffated hazel nut flour are shown. The samples analyzed contained significant amounts of proteins (19%) comparable to legume flour, higher than cereals and lower than deffated oleaginous flours. The oil extracted from the seed was analyzed and the average results obtained were the following: Refraction index, 1.47; saponification No. 184.8; iodine No. 85.0. The average composition of the fatty acids obtained by gas liquid chromatography was: Palmitic acid 2.3% Palmitoleic acid 37.0% Stearic acid 0.5% Oleic acid 39.5% Linoleic acid 6.9% Linolenic acid 1.1% Eicosanoic acid 2.3% Eicosaenoic acid 4.6% Docosenoic acid 3.4% Tetraeicosanoic acid 0.3% These results indicate a good-quality oil due to the low content of linolenic acid. The nutritive value of the deffated meal measured in the rats gave a net protein ratio (NPR) of 3.58, lower than the corresponding casein value (4.10). The true protein digestibility measured in the rat gave a value of 7.3%, compared to 95% for casein.

3411234,"Rats conditioned to eating fixed-size meals (meals at 7 AM and 7 PM), consuming diets rich in palm oil or sunflower seed oil, were used to study the metabolism of chylomicrons and hepatic very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) as a function of time after meal consumption. Rats fed a palm oil diet had higher serum triacylglycerol levels at 7 AM, before the meal (1.96 +/- 0.25 mM vs. 1.09 +/- 0.09 mM) and reached higher levels postprandially (4.32 +/- 0.48 mM vs. 2.87 +/- 0.18 mM) than sunflower seed oil-fed animals, due to higher levels of hepatic VLDL (at 7 AM) and higher levels of chylomicrons and hepatic VLDL (in the postprandial phase). These differences in serum triacylglycerol concentrations between the diets tested were found not to be due to differences in hepatic VLDL triacylglycerol secretion (similar rate for both dietary groups and not very much affected by meal consumption) or chylomicron triacylglycerol secretion (similar response profiles on both diets), pointing towards differences in plasma triacylglycerol catabolism. Subsequent double-label studies on triacylglycerol catabolism of chylomicrons from palm oil- and sunflower seed oil-fed animals in chow-fed recipients showed that palm oil triacyglycerol is catabolized slower than sunflower seed oil triacylglycerol. Furthermore, activities of postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase tended to be higher in sunflower seed oil-fed animals. From these data we conclude that the relative hypertriglyceridemia found in palm oil-fed animals is due to less efficient catabolism and not to increased synthesis of plasma triacylglycerol.",Journal of lipid research,"['D000818', 'D002850', 'D002914', 'D004041', 'D004042', 'D005502', 'D008079', 'D008196', 'D008297', 'D000073878', 'D010938', 'D051381', 'D011919', 'D000074242', 'D014280']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chylomicrons', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL', 'Lymph', 'Male', 'Palm Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sunflower Oil', 'Triglycerides']",Effect of dietary fat composition on the metabolism of triacylglycerol-rich plasma lipoproteins in the postprandial phase in meal-fed rats.,"[None, None, 'Q000097', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000494', None, None, None, 'Q000097']","[None, None, 'blood', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', None, 'blood', 'metabolism', None, None, 'pharmacology', None, None, None, 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3411234,1988
7454133,"Used frying oil can be separated by means of column chromatography on silica gel into an unpolar fraction, which contains predominantly the unaltered triglycerides, and a polar fraction consisting of all oxidation and decomposition products formed during the heating process. The size of the polar fraction indicates the degree of fat deterioration. A similar procedure was applied to obtain fractions from a heated oil to be used in long-term feeding experiments. Several tons of a sunflower oil which had been used in the industrial production of fish fingers were separated into a polar fraction (1) and an unpolar fraction (2). The sunflower oil had not been overheated and was taken at the moment when the production would have been stopped, according to factory practice, and the oil discarded. Fractions 1 (group U) and fraction 2 (group P) as well as the original unheated sunflower oil (group F) and the heated sunflower oil (group H) were fed to rats over 18 months at a level of 20% in the diet. Fraction 1 caused a highly significant reduction in weight gain of the animals as compared with unheated sunflower oil but had only an insignificant detrimental effect upon the many biochemical, histological and clinical parameters. The order of the weight gain caused by the four samples was: U < H < P < F. The changes of other parameters as well as the implications of these long-term feeding studies will be discussed in detail.",Nutrition and metabolism,"['D000818', 'D055598', 'D002621', 'D002850', 'D004041', 'D005260', 'D005524', 'D006358', 'D008297', 'D009821', 'D010944', 'D051381']","['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Dietary Fats', 'Female', 'Food Technology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Male', 'Oils', 'Plants', 'Rats']",Heated oils - chemistry and nutritional aspects.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000633', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'toxicity', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7454133,1981
958339,"The authors deal with the migration behaviour of bezophenone-based ultraviolet absorbents for commodities of low-pressure polyethylene, high-pressure polyethlene, polypropylene and polystyrene. These ultraviolet-absorbent-stabilized plastics (up to 0.5% of ultraviolet absorbent) show a very slight tendency of the light stabilizers towards migration into aqueous, acid or dilute alcoholic foods. Very high migration values are obtained for sunflower oil, Fettsimulans HB 307 or 50% ethanol. The amount of 2-hydroxy-4-octoxybenzophenone which migrates into fat-free foods is only a fraction of the maximum daily dose; a risk to the consumers' health might thus be excluded. In fat-containing foods, the maximum daily dose is also not reached, but the single migration value is higher than the limit value (100 p.p.m.) for total migration. Consequently, the above ultraviolet absorbents should not be used for the ultraviolet stabilization of plastics designed for packing these products. An evaluation of the safety of ultraviolet absorbents of the Dastib type will be possible only if sufficient toxicological data are available.",Die Nahrung,"['D000434', 'D000475', 'D001577', 'D005506', 'D006368', 'D046911', 'D009821', 'D010969', 'D011095', 'D011126', 'D011137', 'D013056']","['Alcoholic Beverages', 'Alkenes', 'Benzophenones', 'Food Contamination', 'Helianthus', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Oils', 'Plastics', 'Polyethylenes', 'Polypropylenes', 'Polystyrenes', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",[New results on migration behavior of benzophenone-based UV absorbents from polyolefins in foods].,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/958339,1976
1150612,"A method is described for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with 3-7 rings in (I) meat, poultry, fish, and yeast; and (II) oils and fats. The extraction of PAHs from group I is incomplete, and, therefore, group I samples must be dissolved homogeneously by saponification in 2N methanolic potassium hydroxide. The PAHs are concentrated by liquid-liquid extraction (methanol-water-cyclohexane, N,N - dimethylformamide - water-cyclohexane) and by column chromatography on Sephadex LH 20. The PAHs are separated by high-performance gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) with columns containing 5% OV-101 on Gas-Chrom Q and estimated by integration of the flame ionization detector signals in relation to an internal standard (3,6-dimethylphenanthrene and/or benzo(b)chrysene). The sensitivity is significantly higher than that obtained with ultraviolet spectroscopic methods. The reproducibility and margin of error were tested with meat samples fortified with 11 PAHs and with samples of sunflower oil. The method was further applied to meat, smoked fish, yeast, and unrefined sunflower oil. All samples investigated contained more than 100 PAHs (characterized by mass spectrometry) of which only the main components were determined: phenanthrene, anthracene, fluorene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene + benzo (j)fluoranthene + benzo(k) fluoranthene, benzo(e)pyrene, benzo(a)pyrene, perylene, dibenz(a,j)anthracene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene + indeno(1,2,3,-cd)pyrene, benzo(ghi)perylene, anthanthrene, and coronene.
