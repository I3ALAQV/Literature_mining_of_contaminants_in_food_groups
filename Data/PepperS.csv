36002476,"Heterosis for agronomic traits is a widespread phenomenon that underpins hybrid crop breeding. However, heterosis at the level of cellular metabolites has not yet been fully explored. Some metabolites are highly sought after, like capsaicinoids found in peppers of the Capsicum genus, which confer the characteristic pungent ('hot') flavour of the fruits. We analysed the metabolic profile of the fruit placenta and pericarp of inter- and intra-specific hybrids of two species of Capsicum peppers, C. chinense (cv. Habanero and cv. Biquinho) and C. annuum var. annuum (cv. Jalapeño and cv. Cascadura Ikeda) in complete diallel crosses with reciprocals. The parents and hybrids were grown in a glasshouse and the profile of primary metabolites (sugars, amino acids and organic acids) and capsaicinoids was generated via gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS), respectively. We found considerable heterotic effects specifically for capsaicinoids accumulation in the fruit placenta of the hybrids, including those derived from non-pungent parents. Furthermore, a large fraction of fruit primary metabolism was influenced by the specific cross combination, with marked parent-of-origin effects, i.e. whether a specific genotype was used as the pistillate or pollen parent. The differences in metabolite levels between the hybrids and their parents provide a snapshot of heterosis for primary and secondary metabolites and may contribute to explain the manifestation of whole-plant heterotic phenotypes.",Scientific reports,"['D002211', 'D002212', 'D002853', 'D005638', 'D006823', 'D000069600', 'D053719', 'D014675']","['Capsaicin', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Fruit', 'Hybrid Vigor', 'Plant Breeding', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vegetables']",Heterosis for capsacinoids accumulation in chili pepper hybrids is dependent on parent-of-origin effect.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000235', None, None, None]","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'genetics', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36002476,2022

35709202,"Industrialization plays a vital role in the development of a country's economy. However, it also adversely affects the environment by discharging various unwanted and harmful substances such as heavy metals into the surface and subsurface aquifers. The current research work investigates the identification, characterization, and evaluation of specific heavy metals in industrial wastewater (IWW) and different composite samples of soil and vegetables (onion, pumpkin, lady finger, and green pepper) collected from selected agricultural fields irrigated with canals fed IWW in Mingora city of Swat (Pakistan). Obtained results were compared with the tube well water irrigated soil and vegetables grown in it. Heavy metals accumulation was tested through wet digestion method and atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The metal transfer factor (MTF) of heavy metals from soil to vegetables was also determined along with the health index (HI) to assess the potential health risk of the metals towards consumers using Monte Carlo simulation technique. Analysis of water samples showed that the concentration in mg l-1 of heavy metals in IWW follows the trend Fe (6.72) > Cr (0.537) > Pb (0.393) > Co (0.204) > Mn (0.125) > Ni (0.121). Analysis of the soil samples irrigated with IWW followed the order of Fe (47.27) > Pb (2.92) > Cr (2.90) >Ni (1.02) > Mn (0.90) > Co (0.68) and Fe (17.12) > Pb (2.12) > Cr (2.03) >Ni (0.76) > Co (0.49) > Mn (0.23) irrigated with TWW. Heavy metals concentration values found in soil irrigated with IWW were higher than the soil irrigated with TWW. Similar trends were found for agricultural produces grown on soil irrigated with IWW and found higher than the normal allowable WHO limits, indicating higher possibilities of health risks if continuously consumed. MTF values were found higher than 1 for ladyfinger and green pepper for Pb intake and pumpkin for Mn intake. The current study suggests the continuous monitoring of soil, irrigation water and agricultural products to prevent heavy metals concentration beyond allowable limits, in the food chain. Thus, concrete preventive measures must be taken to reduce heavy metal accumulation through wastewater irrigation to protect both human and animal health in the study area of Mingora Swat Pakistan.",PloS one,"['D057914', 'D000818', 'D004784', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D007854', 'D019216', 'D018570', 'D012987', 'D012989', 'D014675', 'D062065', 'D014867']","['Agricultural Irrigation', 'Animals', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Lead', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Vegetables', 'Waste Water', 'Water']","Assessment of heavy metals accumulation in agricultural soil, vegetables and associated health risks.","['Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['methods', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35709202,2022
35678870,"The past mining activities in Bokkos Local Government Area (LGA) were performed in an uncontrolled way and gave rise to many abandoned ponds now serving as domestic and irrigation water sources. Past research focused mainly on the environmental impact, and we show for the first time what the human health risk through consumption of contaminated food crops is in these communities. This study was designed to determine the level of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) contamination in pond water, soil, and food crops and assess the health risk of inhabitants in the abandoned tin mining community in Bokkos LGA. Samples of the mining pond water, soil, and selected food crops from farms irrigated with the pond water: bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina), pepper (Piper nigrum), okra (Albelmoschus esculentus), maize (Zea mays), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and Irish potato (Solanum tuberosum) were analyzed for each of the eight PTEs (viz. Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cd, and Pb) using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The results obtained showed that the levels of all the PTEs analyzed in the soil, pond water, and selected food crops except for Fe and Mn in soil and Cd in sweet potato were greater than their corresponding background area values (p < 0.05). Also, the mean concentrations of all the PTEs except for Cu in pond water were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the WHO maximum permissible limit. With the exception of Fe, Ni, and Zn for pepper and okra, Cu and Fe for maize grains as well as Cu, Ni, and Zn for sweet and Irish potatoes and Fe and Cd for sweet potato, the mean concentrations of PTEs in the food crops were significantly higher than WHO maximum permissible limit. The EF values of Cd (0.39); Cu (3.59) and Ni (2.81); Cr (9.38) and Pb (17.84); and Mn (178.13) and Zn (83.22) classified the soil as minimally, moderately, significantly, and extremely highly enriched, respectively. The PI values of all the PTEs in the soil studied were all greater than 5, indicating that the soils were severely contaminated. There was evidence that food crops significantly bioaccumulated PTEs either as a result of contaminated soil and/or irrigation water. The bioaccumulation was not uniform and was dominated by transfer from the polluted irrigation water. The bitter leaf, okra, and to some extent maize had the highest transfer of PTEs, and Mn, Cu, and Zn had the highest bioaccumulation in the food crops investigated. The hazardous index (HI) for the eight PTEs through the consumption of food crops was 107 for children and 33 for adults which greatly exceeded the recommended limit of 1, thus indicating that possible health risks exist for both local children and adults. For every PTE, the values of HI for children are many-fold higher than those for adults, which is of particular concern due to the high HI values for Pb found for maize consumption, a typical staple food.

35347716,"Fermentation of eight vegetables was studied as an alternative for reclamation of surplus volumes. Fermentation performance was predicted by comparing the amounts of acid that could be produced from the intrinsic sugar content with that buffered by the fresh vegetable matrices prior to reaching an inhibitory pH for fermentative microbes (3.30). Native fermentations were brined with 345.0 mM sodium chloride, 40.0 mM calcium chloride, 6.0 mM potassium sorbate, and vinegar to adjust the initial pH to 4.70. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis, pH, and carbon dioxide measurements and spiral plating on selective media were employed to monitor the progress of fermentations. The average colony counts for yeast and/or molds and Enterobacteriaceae declined to undetectable levels from 3.6 ± 1.5 log CFU/ml within 7 days of fermentation. The fermentation of sugars produced lactic, acetic, succinic, and/or malic acids, and ethanol. As predicted, the fermentation of vegetables with low sugar content, such as broccoli, green leaf lettuce, and green pea proceeded to completion. The fermentation of vegetables with a moderate sugar content, such as green bell pepper, red ripened tomato, and green bean were incomplete at pH 3.1 ± 0.2. The fermentation of high sugar vegetables including sweet potato and corn were expected and observed to be incomplete. It is concluded that the intrinsic sugar content and buffer capacity of surplus vegetables are relevant parameters in obtaining complete fermentations. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Vegetables are the second most wasted commodity in the United States and a substantial constituent of the global food waste. Development of fermentation to reclaim surplus vegetables from farms, grocery stores, and farmer's markets offers opportunities to ameliorate economic losses and environmental impact and add value to waste. The research described here suggests that a fraction of vegetables could be fermented in cover brines while others, with high sugar content, need specialized handling.

34812593,"Cera pepper (Capsicum pubescens) is an exotic fruit considered as a rich source of nutraceuticals with known benefits for human health and also an economic resource for local producers in Mexico. The present investigation reports on the in vitro and in situ antifungal activity of the essential oil from Mentha piperita and its two major volatiles (menthol and menthone) against Fusarium sambucinum, which is a causal agent of soft rot in cera pepper. The application of these components in pepper fruits previously infected with F. sambucinum caused a significant delay (p<0.05) in the emergence of soft rot symptoms. This effect was reflected in the maintenance of pH and fruit firmness during a period of 10 days. The nutrimental content of the fruits (protein, fiber, fat and other proximate parameters) was conserved in the same period of time.

The levels of TMs were measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The mean levels of Ni, Cu, Cd, Cr, As and Zn in all crops were below maximum permissible concentrations (MPCs), while those of Pb in pepper (0.109 mg/kg fw), eggplant (0.103 mg/kg fw) and green bean (0.177 mg/kg fw) slightly exceeded MPCs (0.1 mg/kg fw). Leafy vegetables had relatively higher concentrations of Al, As, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe and Mn compared to fruiting vegetables and maize. The estimated daily intake value of each TM estimated for each crop was found to be below the tolerable daily intake value. The target hazard quotients of all TMs in all crops did not exceed the acceptable non-carcinogenic risk level. However, hazard index (HI) value (1.57) in tomato was found to be above the threshold value of 1, indicating non-carcinogenic risks for consumers due to the intake of combined TMs in tomato. The THQ values of As, Co and Pb contributed 46.4%, 24.5% and 16.4% of the HI value of tomato, respectively. High daily consumption amount of tomato likely resulted in high HI value.

In the present study, the volatile profiles of 96 samples of two different ground bell peppers harvested in diverse Italian geographical areas, Altino (Abruzzo) and Senise (Lucania), and a commercial sweet paprika, have been studied by means of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The investigation of their volatile profile has led to the identification of 59 analytes. Eventually, a discriminant classifier, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), was exploited to discriminate samples according to their geographical origin. The model provided very accurate results in external validation; in fact, it correctly classified all the 30 test samples, achieving 100% correct classification (on the validation set). Furthermore, in order to understand which volatiles contribute the most at differentiating the bell peppers from the different origins, a variable selection approach, Variable Importance in Projection (VIP), was used.

This setup requires no solvent application nor gas flow, thus resulting in a very simple and rapid analysis that can be applied directly to the sample without any prior workup or preparation. Combined with robust data pre-processing and subsequent chemometric analyses, this analytical method was capable of indicating the geographical origin of each pepper source with up to 98% accuracies in all sub-studies. The simplicity and speed of this approach open up the exciting opportunity for onsite analysis without the need for a highly trained operator.

In this study, the binary blending of Cabernet Franc wines containing high levels of MPs and three monovarietal red wines with two proportions was conducted after fermentation. Volatiles were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and wines were evaluated by quantitative descriptive analysis at three-month intervals during six-month bottle aging. Results showed blending wines exhibited lower intensity of 'green pepper', especially CFC samples blended by Cabernet Sauvignon wines with an even higher concentration of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP). Based on Pearson correlation analysis, acetates could promote the expression of 'tropical fruity' and suppress 'green pepper' caused by IBMP. Positive correlation was observed among 'green pepper', 'herbaceous', and 'berry'. The concentration balance between IBMP and other volatiles associated with 'green pepper' and fruity notes was further investigated through sensory experiments in aroma reconstitution. Higher pleasant fruity perception was obtained with the concentration proportion of 1-hexanol (1000 μg/L), isoamyl acetate (550 μg/L), ethyl hexanoate (400 μg/L), and ethyl octanoate (900 μg/L) as in CFC samples.

Using the established MSI platform, we can track the migration of insecticides and fungicides into the inner region of foods. The results revealed that both the octanol-water partition coefficient of pesticides and water content of garden stuffs could influence the discrepancy in the migration speed of pesticides into food kernels.

We vertically separated the placental septum in which capsaicinoids are synthesized and performed quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for 18 genes involved in capsaicinoid biosynthesis. We also used the placental septum for capsaicinoid quantification so that the gene expression levels and capsaicinoid contents in the same fruits were obtained, and their correlations were analyzed using 20 biological replicates. Among the 18 genes, expression levels of 11 genes (WRKY9, CaMYB31, AT3, BCAT, BCKDH, KAS I, KAS III, ACL, CaKR1, FAT, and pAMT) had a significant positive correlation with the capsaicinoid concentration, and they were considered to upregulate capsaicinoid biosynthesis.

Herein, long-term-stored chili pepper powder (LSCPP) and fresh chili pepper powder (FCPP) were analyzed using internal transcribed spacer sequencing and volatile organic compound fingerprinting by headspace capillary-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry. Fungal analysis detected only Xeromyces bisporus with high accuracy in all the analyzed LSCPP samples. However, the proliferation of X. bisporus on nonspecific spots complicated the distinguishing process between the two groups based solely on fungal analysis. Therefore, nine compounds (three ketones, one alcohol, two aldehydes, one ester, one furan, and one sulfur compound) obtained by autoxidation and fungal metabolism were selected as potential markers for distinguishing LSCPP and FCPP. These above-mentioned substances, which were confirmed as off-flavor species owing to ""stale"" odor, emitted lipid fragrance and were used to successfully distinguish LSCPP from FCPP using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis.

Transcriptomic analysis of high-cutin PI 257145 and low-cutin PI 224448 resulted in the identification of 2703 statistically significant differentially expressed genes, including 1693 genes upregulated and 1010 downregulated in high-cutin PI 257145. Genes and transcription factors such as GDSL lipase, glycerol-3 phosphate acyltransferase 6, long-chain acyltransferase 2, cytochrome P450 86A/77A, SHN1, ANL2 and HDG1 highly contributed to the high cutin content in PI 257145. We predicted a putative cutin biosynthetic pathway for habanero peppers based on deep transcriptome analysis. This is the first study of the transcriptome and metabolome pertaining to cutin in habanero peppers. These analyses improve our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms regulating the accumulation of cutin in habanero pepper fruits. These resources can be built on for developing cultivars with high cutin content that show resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses with superior postharvest appearance.",International journal of molecular sciences,"['D053898', 'D002212', 'D002265', 'D003577', 'D015536', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D018506', 'D063990', 'D005838', 'D005992', 'D018398', 'D008563', 'D055432', 'D010169', 'D010641', 'D000081246', 'D014157', 'D059467', 'D015854']","['Biosynthetic Pathways', 'Capsicum', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Gene Ontology', 'Genotype', 'Glycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Metabolomics', 'Palmitic Acids', 'Phenotype', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation']",Integrated Metabolomic and Transcriptomic Analysis to Characterize Cutin Biosynthesis between Low- and High-Cutin Genotypes of ,"['Q000235', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None]","['genetics', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'genetics', None, 'genetics', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'methods', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32092953,2021

The residual pesticides on fruits and vegetables were collected by sweeping a metallic probe across the sample surface for 2 cm. The analytes collected on the probe were desorbed and ionized in a thermal desorption electrospray ionization (TD-ESI) source, after which analyte ions were detected by a triple quadruple mass analyzer (QqQ) operated in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. With this TD-ESI/MS/MS approach, 308 pesticides were monitored, where a mixture containing 15 pesticide standards was successfully identified to demonstrate the capability of this approach to screen trace multiresidue pesticides. The approach had reasonable detection limits (<50 ppb) and reproducibility (RSD: 8.43%, n = 9) from the analysis of a benthiazole standard solution. Real samples including a tomato and bell pepper were analyzed using this TD-ESI/MS/MS approach.

31813159,"Black pepper (Piper nigrum; BP), known as the 'king of spices', imported from various countries is widely available in Saudi Arabian markets, as its demand as a food as well as a medicine for minor ailments is increasing in the country. However, there is a lack of appropriate information regarding these samples in terms of quality variation and standardization. We thus aimed to evaluate the quality and standardize the BP sample with respect to its physicochemical characters, active principle variation [i.e. piperine (PPN)], toxicity, and biological activity. The main focus is to validate whether any difference exists in the quality and quantity of active principle in these samples. For this purpose, physicochemical (chemical tests and ash values) and instrumental analyses [accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-diode array detector, infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and inductively coupled plasma-MS (ICP-MS)] and biological evaluation {in vitro antioxidant activity [2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] and cytotoxicity assay} were performed. An extract yield (g) with %recovery of 2.26 ± 4.24 (11.3) was obtained for the Vietnamese sample, using a fast and rapid method of extraction (ASE). These values were 1.22 ± 2.64 (6.1) and 0.75 ± 1.69 (3.75) for the Pakistani and Indian samples. Physicochemical tests revealed the presence of flavonoids and phenolic compounds in all samples; however, in the Vietnamese sample a low amount of total, acid-insoluble, and high water-soluble ash value was noted. IR and NMR was applied to further standardize the samples. Results of ICP-MS analysis showed a high amount of macronutrients and micronutrients in the samples tested while UHPLC analysis revealed a high amount of PPN (ng/mL) in the Pakistani sample (1,362,614.09); these values were 1,051,848.04 and 768,512.81 for the Vietnamese and Indian samples, respectively.

The influence of time (characterized by ripening), after 14 and 28 days of treatment, treatment regimen, and their combined impact on the metabolome were studied using HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis of polar and apolar compounds. The results showed that flavonoids and capsianosides decreased with ripening in leaves, but organic acids, monosaccharides, and carotenoids increased in fruits. The treatment of Capsicum fruits with Actium® increased phenylalanine and total monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) compared to controls, suggesting a further stage in ripening. An increase in carotenoids concomitant with an increase of some digalactosyl diacylglycerols, which are part of the chromoplasts lipid machinery of enzymes involved in the synthesis of carotenoids, was also observed.

Based on three different harvest times and two different washing durations, processing factors (PFs) and reduction rates were calculated for each washing treatment. The residues gradually decreased during washing treatments with increasing process duration. Similarly, a gradual reduction was noted with the progress of harvest times. This in turn corresponded to an increase in PF. Ultrasonic cleaning and citric acid (9%) washing were more effective than the others.

Since this transition leads to the production of reactive species, chromoplasts are characteristic sites for biosynthesis and accumulation of carotenoids and other antioxidants. Here, we have analysed the chromoplast membranes from Capsicum annuum L. fruits, finding a significant expression of the capsanthin/capsorubin synthase. This enzyme was isolated by a very mild procedure allowing its analyses under quasi-native conditions. The isolated complex appeared as a red coloured homo-trimer, suggesting the retention of at least one of the typical carotenoids from C. annuum. Moreover, the protein complex was co-purified with a non-proteinaceous fraction of carotenoid aggregates carrying a high molecular weight and separable only by Size Exclusion Chromatography. This last finding suggested a relationship between the carotenoids synthesis on chromoplast membranes, the presence, and storage of organised carotenoids aggregates typical for chromoplasts.

The aim was to evaluate the effects of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion on the release and bioactivity of encapsulated bio-actives, after each digestion step. The results showed that the release of phenolics and carotenoids, as well as antioxidants, anti-hyperglycemic, and anti-inflammatory activities are influenced by pH and intestinal fluid, with pH 7.5 exhibited at higher levels. There was a rapid initial release of carotenoids from whey protein matrices, while a more gradual increase of phenolics was observed, reaching around 50% for both encapsulates first at 6 h and 37 °C, and small intestine conditions. The encapsulation of RPW demonstrated a protective effect against pH changes and enzymatic activities along digestion, and contributed to the increase in bio-accessibility in the gut. Also, the results suggest that encapsulation is an efficient method for valorization of bio-actives from RPW, with improvements in nutrition, color, and bioactive properties.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D001682', 'D002212', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D004063', 'D004339', 'D041981', 'D010636', 'D010936', 'D013057']","['Biological Availability', 'Capsicum', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Digestion', 'Drug Compounding', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Phenols', 'Plant Extracts', 'Spectrum Analysis']",Bioavailability and Bioactivity of Encapsulated Phenolics and Carotenoids Isolated from Red Pepper Waste.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387219,2020

The concentrations of 26 pesticide residues were determined by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that there were 25 pesticides (15 OPs, 7 PYs, 3 CBs) found in 86 bell pepper samples, and the total number of positives was 120. The total frequency was 28.76%. The detection frequency for OPs, PYs and CBs was 16.39%, 12.37% and 3.01%, respectively. The most frequently detected pesticide was bifenthrin, with the frequency of 5.02%. 5.35% of samples contained pesticide residues above the maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by China. 7.36% of samples contained more than one pesticide. The values of %ADI were below 100, while the %ARfD of carbofuran and methidathion exceeded 100 for children. The cumulative risk was highest for OPs.

31113980,"Foods and beverage aroma results from multicomponent mixtures of volatile compounds present in the food that interact with olfactory receptors and produce a perceptual response in the brain. However, the perceptual interactions that occur when complex odor mixtures are combined are not well understood. Here we used Gas chromatography-Recomposition-Olfactometry (GC-R) to better understand the role that individual compounds have on the perceived sensory aroma of bitters. Bitters are the concentrated alcoholic extract of flavorful plant materials with a wide range of complex sensory and chemical aroma profiles that have not been extensively studied. Previously, we demonstrated that Angostura bitters are characterized by complex aroma attributes described as cola, ginger, orange peel, and black pepper and that the volatile composition of Angostura bitters is predominantly composed of terpenoids. Using GC-R to create in-instrument mixtures of the Angostura headspace extracts, the sensory attributes of Angostura extracts with linalool, α-terpinyl-acetate and caryophyllene omitted were evaluated. The omission experiments demonstrated direct and indirect effects of the individual compounds on the aroma attributes of Angostura bitters, through masking, additive, and synergistic interactions. Caryophyllene in particular, which was present in the headspace extracts at concentration only slightly above sensory threshold levels, had a large and unexpected impact on the sensory properties of the mixtures and may be most responsible for the aromas associated with the whole sample.

31027574,"Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is the most abundant capsaicinoids found in hot peppers (Capsicum annum and Capsicum frutescens). It has been well documented that capsaicin plays an important role in the defense against the attack of herbivores or pathogens on Capsicum plants. A few insect herbivores such as Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa assulta have been recorded to be capable of feeding on hot pepper fruits, suggesting that these insects evolve mechanisms against the toxicity of capsaicin. Although cytochrome P450-meidated detoxification is considered to be an important mechanism by which cotton bollworms cope with capsaicin, experimental evidence is lacking. In this study, we compared the capacity of four H. armigera P450s (CYP6B6, CYP9A12, CYP9A14 and CYP9A17) in capsaicin metabolism, and the capsaicin metabolites were screened and tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

30993530,"Metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic acid hydroxy stearic acid (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi). Our study proves the importance of overall FAHFA analysis in food (especially in a functional food), because of their potential metabolic benefits and possible future incorporation in special diets.","Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)","['D000893', 'D004952', 'D005227', 'D005504', 'D055951', 'D006801', 'D007328', 'D008055', 'D013058', 'D024821', 'D010944']","['Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Esters', 'Fatty Acids', 'Food Analysis', 'Functional Food', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Plants']",Analysis of Fatty Acid Esters of Hydroxyl Fatty Acid in Selected Plant Food.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000178', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, 'diet therapy', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993530,2019

Our subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and expression level analyses proved that among these homologues Capana04g000412 is the only functional GGPPS (CaGGPPS1) for carotenoid biosynthesis in pepper fruits. We demonstrated that CaGGPPS1 interacts with a catalytically inactive small subunit homologue protein CaSSUII, and such an interaction promotes CaGGPPS1 enzymatic activity. We also revealed a protein-protein interaction between CaSSUII and a putative phytoene synthase and the repression of carotenoid accumulation by silencing CaSSUII in pepper fruits.

Pepper residues present on the thread were analyzed by the application of DC voltage and solvent to cause field-induced charged droplet generation. Capsaicinoids extracted from the sample are contained in the electrosprayed droplets and transported to the mass spectrometer for characterization. The thread spray mass spectrometry method was optimized using commercially available materials like 100% cotton, cotton:polyester (35/65), 100% polyester, and nylon fabrics and subsequently applied for in-situ analysis of six different pepper fruits and pepper spray residues on fabrics. The results indicated that the special physico-chemical characteristics of threads allowed a rapid and convenient sampling and ionization of pepper products for analysis by mass spectrometry.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of potentially toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in spices marketed in Brazil. The fungal contamination was evaluated by direct plating for samples of clove, black and white peppers. Spread plate was used for the samples of rosemary, cinnamon, fennel, pepperoni pepper and oregano. Analyses were performed in triplicate in DG18 media with incubation at 25°C for 7days. The isolation and identification of fungi followed specific recommendations of culture media and incubation period for each genus. The presence of mycotoxins in spices was verified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to fluorescence. The frequency of species potentially toxigenic was high in white and black peppers with presence of both aflatoxigenic and ochratoxigenic fungi. Only rosemary and fennel showed contamination with aflatoxin B1 and there was a positive correlation (ρ<0.01) between the rosemary contamination with the presence of AFB1 and A. flavus. Even in the presence of ochratoxigenic fungi, ochratoxin A was not detected in the samples. The presence of natural components with antimicrobial activity could justify the low presence of mycotoxins, even in the presence of known toxigenic fungi in the samples. Mycotoxins were not detected in spices covered by Brazilian regulation of mycotoxins.

The flavor properties were established by sensory profiling and analysis of volatile and non-volatile components, including titratable acidity, pH, residual sugars and organic acids. A total of 72 volatile compounds were identified in the 14 apple ciders using dynamic headspace sampling (DHS) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The main volatile compounds found in apple ciders were esters and higher alcohols, followed by aldehydes and fatty acids. Sensory characterizations of the aroma and taste of apple ciders were carried out by a trained sensory panel using descriptive analysis with 23 sensory attributes. The attributes apple, cooked apple, yeasty, sweet and sour were the most predominant sensory descriptors used to describe the similarities and differences in the samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that floral and fruity (fresh apple, banana and pear) odors were highly associated with sweet taste and opposed to the more complex aroma attributes (yeasty, lactic, chemical, mouldy, black pepper and earthy) and sour taste. Most of the UK apple ciders were characterized by these complex odors and taste notes sour, astringent and bitter, whereas ciders from the Scandinavian region had diverse sensory profiles.

29238032,"Shimatogarashi (Capsicum frutescens) is a typical chili pepper domesticated in southern Japan. Important traits of Shimatogarashi peppers, such as color; proportion of organic acids, capsaicinoids, and aromatic compounds; and antioxidant activity in three stages of maturity (green (immature), orange (turning), and red (mature) stages) were characterized. The results indicated that the concentration of organic acids, including ascorbic, citric, and malic acid, increased during ripening. In addition, the amount of capsaicinoids, which are responsible for the pungent taste of chili peppers, increased as the fruit matured to the orange and red stages. The volatile compound profile of Shimatogarashi was dominated by the presence of esters, which mainly contributed to fruity notes. The total amount of volatile compounds analyzed by gas chromatography-headspace solid-phase microextraction (GC-HS-SPME), especially esters, decreased as the fruit changed in color from green to red. This was in contrast to the amount of terpenoids, especially limonene, which increased at the red stage, denoting a change in flavor from fruity to a more citrus-like aroma. Based on the total phenolic content (TPC), the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical method, the antioxidant capacity of Shimatogarashi showed an increase at the mature red stage. However, while the red stage showed higher pungency and antioxidant capacity as well as an attractive color, the results of aromatic compound analysis revealed that the immature green stage had the advantages of having pleasant fruity smell, making it suitable for use in condiments.",Journal of oleo science,"['D000975', 'D002212', 'D005421', 'D005638', 'D064209', 'D010858']","['Antioxidants', 'Capsicum', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Fruit', 'Phytochemicals', 'Pigmentation']","Influence of Fruit Ripening on Color, Organic Acid Contents, Capsaicinoids, Aroma Compounds, and Antioxidant Capacity of Shimatogarashi (Capsicum frutescens).","['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29238032,2018

In this study, we observed the hydrolyzing activity of a fungus-inducible pepper carboxylesterase (PepEST) on cell walls of C. gloeosporioides, causing growth retardation of the fungus by blocking appressorium formation. To determine the cellular basis for the growth inhibition, we observed the localization of PepEST on the fungus and found the attachment of the protein on surfaces of conidia and germination tubes. Moreover, we examined the decomposition of cell-wall materials from the fungal surface after reaction with PepEST, which led to the identification of 1,2-dithiane-4,5-diol (DTD) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Exogenous DTD treatment did not elicit expression of defense-related genes in the host plant but did trigger the necrosis of C. gloeosporioides. Furthermore, the DTD compound displayed protective effects on pepper fruits and plants against C. gloeosporioides and C. coccodes, respectively. In addition, DTD was also effective in preventing other diseases, such as rice blast, tomato late blight, and wheat leaf rust. Therefore, our results provide evidence that PepEST is involved in hydrolysis of the outmost layer of the fungal cell walls and that DTD has antifungal activity, suggesting an alternative strategy to control agronomically important phytopathogens.",Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,"['D002212', 'D043182', 'D002473', 'D020231']","['Capsicum', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Cell Wall', 'Colletotrichum']",A Fungus-Inducible Pepper Carboxylesterase Exhibits Antifungal Activity by Decomposing the Outer Layer of Fungal Cell Walls.,"['Q000201', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187']","['enzymology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29189097,2018

We performed a shade cloth trial covering the fruit zone (from pepper-corn size to maturity) with four polyethylene 1 m curtains with different optical properties (20% shading factor Pearl colored and 40% shading factor Aluminet, Blue, and Black colored) and a Control with no cover. Cluster temperature was 3.7 °C lower on the Southwest side in Black-40% clusters during the warmest part of the day compared to Control. Results indicated a lower berry weight under the Aluminet-40%. Berries under the nets often had significantly lower pH and higher TA than Control, but only the Black-40% were significant at harvest. Black-40% had higher values of anthocyanins than Control toward the last weeks of development. Berry skin flavonol and anthocyanin composition and concentration were measured by C18 reversed-phased HPLC; and proanthocyanidin isolates were characterized by acid catalysis in the presence of excess phloroglucinol followed by reversed-phase HPLC. Proanthocyanidins and flavonol contents were lower in Black-40% before veraison and the first part of ripening, respectively. However, their contents in Control decreased toward the end of ripening to a point where any net was different from Control.

Thus, patients with Refsum's disease have to follow a specific diet resigning foods with high levels of phytanic acid and trans-phytol like products from ruminant animals with a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of ≤ 10 mg/d. We recently reported the occurrence of phytyl fatty acid esters (PFAE, trans-phytol esterified with a fatty acid) in bell pepper with trans-phytol amounts of up to 5.4 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW). In this study we carried out in vitro-digestion experiments of PFAE with artificial digestion fluids. Our results demonstrate that PFAE actually are a source for bioavailable trans-phytol and thus add to the TDI. Eating only one portion of bell pepper (∼150 g) could therefore lead to exploitation of the TDI of up to 81%.

Because of the urgent need for confirmation of possible peanut presence in chili peppers, an LC-MS/MS method was optimized and developed for this particular food matrix. Although several studies optimized LC-MS detection strategies specific for peanuts, the presence of complex components in the spices (e.g., phenolic components) makes method optimization and validation necessarily. Focus was laid on validation of the method with real incurred chili peppers (whereby a known amount of peanut is added) at low concentrations, to deal with possible matrix interferences. LC-MS/MS proves to be a good alternative to the currently most applied methods (ELISA and RT-PCR) and can be used as a complementary method of analysis when results are unclear. Peanut marker peptides were selected based on their abundancy in digested incurred chili peppers.

Seven culinary spices including black pepper, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, ginger, Mediterranean oregano, rosemary, and turmeric were extracted with boiling water. Major chemical constituents were characterized by RP-HPLC-DAD method and antioxidant capacity was determined by measuring colorimetrically the extent to scavenge ABTS radical cations. Effects of spice extracts on the viability of 88 anaerobic and facultative isolates from intestinal microbiota were determined by using Brucella agar plates containing serial dilutions of extracts. A total of 14 phenolic compounds, a piperine, cinnamic acid, and cinnamaldehyde were identified and quantitated. Spice extracts exhibited high antioxidant capacity that correlated with the total amount of major chemicals. All spice extracts, with the exception of turmeric, enhanced the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. All spices exhibited inhibitory activity against selected Ruminococcus species. Cinnamon, oregano, and rosemary were active against selected Fusobacterium strains and cinnamon, rosemary, and turmeric were active against selected Clostridium spp. Some spices displayed prebiotic-like activity by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppressing the growth of pathogenic bacteria, suggesting their potential role in the regulation of intestinal microbiota and the enhancement of gastrointestinal health.

28060498,"The aromatic descriptor ""green"", reflecting grape unripeness in French red wines, is frequently associated with the levels of 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines, particularly 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP), which has bell pepper nuances. Nevertheless, not all green aromatic expressions in red wines correlate with 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazine concentrations. This study considered sensory and chemical approaches using Cabernet Sauvignon wines obtained from grapes harvested at one-month intervals during the 2014 and 2015 vintages to investigate other volatile odoriferous compounds. Semipreparative HPLC fractionation of wine extracts revealed a fraction with specific green aromas in the early harvest wines. Its sensory impact was confirmed by omission and reconstitution tests. Then, multidimensional gas chromatography coupled with olfactometry and mass spectrometry (MDGC-O-MS/TOF) was used for molecular characterization of the aroma compounds associated with the green aromas. Surprisingly, eucalyptol (1,8-cineole), with menthol odor was highlighted and assayed at concentrations sometimes above its olfactory detection threshold in Cabernet Sauvignon and Fer Servadou wines. Sensory tests confirmed its impact at several concentrations detected in French red wines (up to 2.61 ± 0.03 μg/L) on the menthol nuance and overall green perception, particularly via an additive effect with IBMP. Quantitation of 1,8-cineole in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes during berry development in 2015 revealed its varietal origin with abundant concentrations in unripe berries and decrease during grape maturation. Moreover, the implication of an invasive plant (Artemisia verlotiorum) growing in certain vineyards was shown to be responsible for increased 1,8-cineole concentrations in some wines.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D019306', 'D002851', 'D003511', 'D000077591', 'D005504', 'D005602', 'D006801', 'D058865', 'D013058', 'D039821', 'D009812', 'D064367', 'D011719', 'D027843', 'D055549', 'D014920']","['Artemisia', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclohexanols', 'Eucalyptol', 'Food Analysis', 'France', 'Humans', 'Introduced Species', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Monoterpenes', 'Odorants', 'Olfactometry', 'Pyrazines', 'Vitis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Wine']","1,8-Cineole in French Red Wines: Evidence for a Contribution Related to Its Various Origins.","[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', None, None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28060498,2017

27619377,"The analysis of pesticides in food products requires accurate measurements for which standardised protocols have been developed. This paper reports the validation of QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe)-based methods applied to three different food samples (brown rice, red pepper and mandarin orange) analysed using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The validation of the analytical methods used to measure 113 pesticides, including various insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, was conducted in three food matrices and at three spiking levels by three different laboratories. The set of validated results was interpreted, statistically analysed and visualised using principal component analysis (PCA). Notably, the matrix effects in GC-MS analysis for most of the tested pesticides from different matrices were lowered to practical values (less than 30%) appropriate for routine analysis. This allowed for the quantification of pesticides in the samples using standard and analyte protectants (APs) in the reagent method blank as a screening measure, providing an alternative to matrix-matched calibration. Alternatively, the use of only one standardised calibration (grape matrix) in combination with APs also allowed for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of pesticides in different matrices. The inclusion of APs reduced the differences in the matrix-induced enhancement effects of various samples. The use of an internal standard (IS) to correct the matrix effects was also noted. The normalisation of the analyte peak with triphenyl phosphate (TPP) as an IS resulted in a slight improvement of validation values such as precision and linearity in only one laboratory, but it lowered the value of matrix effects in all three laboratories.","Food additives & contaminants.

Growth rates and lag phases were estimated using linear regression. Diverse secondary models were assessed for their ability to describe the radial growth rate as a function of individual and combined effect of aw and temperature. Optimum radial growth rate ranged from 0.75±0.04 to 2.65±0.02mm/day for A. flavus and 1.77±0.10 to 2.50±0.10mm/day for A. parasiticus based on the Rosso cardinal estimations. Despite the growth failure of some isolates at marginal conditions, all the studied models showed good performance to predict the growth rates. Validation of the models was performed on independently derived data. The bias factors (0.73-1.03), accuracy factors (0.97-1.36) and root mean square error (0.050-0.278) show that the examined models are conservative predictors of the colony growth rate of both fungal species in black peppers. The Rosso cardinal model can be recommended to describe the individual aw effect while the extended Gibson model was the best model for describing the combined effect of aw and temperature on the growth rate of both fungal species in peppercorns. Temperature optimum ranged from 30 to 33°C, while aw optimum was 0.87-0.92 as estimated by multi-factorial cardinal model for both species. The estimated minimum temperature and aw for A. flavus and A. parasiticus for growth were 11-16°C and 0.73-0.76, respectively, hence, achieving these conditions should be considered during storage to prevent the growth of these mycotoxigenic fungal species in black peppercorns.

A total of 90 spice samples (ginger: n = 30; chili: n = 30; pepper n = 30) was taken from various sales outlets of Abidjan. OTA was quantified using an HPLC apparatus coupled with a fluorimetric detector. The chili and ginger samples were contaminated with OTA at a mean concentration of 57.48 ± 174 and 0.12 ± 0.15 μg/kg, respectively. No contamination of the pepper samples was detected.

Flonicamid (10% active ingredient) was applied (via foliar application) to all fruits, including those groups grown under normal conditions (glass house) or under no shade cover (vinyl house). Samples were extracted using a Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe ""QuEChERS"" method and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The method performance, including linearity, recovery, limits of detection (LOD), and quantitation (LOQ), was satisfactory. Throughout the experimental period, the residual levels of flonicamid and TFNG were not uniform, whereas that of TFNA remained constant. The total sum of the residues (flonicamid and its metabolites) was higher in the vinyl house with shade cover than in the glass house, under various conditions. The total residues were significantly higher when the treatment was applied under high light shade (75%). The flonicamid half-life decreased from 47.2 days (under normal conditions) to 28.4 days (at high temperatures) in the glass house, while it increased from 47.9 days (no shade cover) to 66 days (75% light shading) in the vinyl house. High humidity leads to decreases in the total sum of flonicamid residues in red bell pepper grown in a glass house, because it leads to an increase in the rate of water loss, which in turn accelerates the volatilization of the pesticide. For safety reasons, it is advisable to grow red bell pepper under glass house conditions because of the effects of solar radiation, which increases the rate of flonicamid degradation into its metabolites.",Environmental monitoring and assessment,"['D002212', 'D002853', 'D002980', 'D004784', 'D005638', 'D006207', 'D057230', 'D009536', 'D010575', 'D013472', 'D053719']","['Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Climate', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Fruit', 'Half-Life', 'Limit of Detection', 'Niacinamide', 'Pesticides', 'Sunlight', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Effects of light shading and climatic conditions on the metabolic behavior of flonicamid in red bell pepper.,"['Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000031', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379']","['chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'analysis', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26846294,2016

In this study, analyses were performed to determine the levels and incidence of aflatoxins (AFs) in peanut products, tree nuts, spices, and Coix seeds; ochratoxin A (OTA) in wheat and roasted coffee, as well as OTA and AFs in rice; and citrinin (CIT) in red yeast rice (RYR) products. A total of 712 samples from nine different food categories were collected between 2012 and 2013. The samples were analyzed over 2 years for AFs, OTA, and CIT by methods recommended by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. These official analytical methods were extensively validated in-house and through interlaboratory trials. The analytical values of suspected contaminated specimens were confirmed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify the specific mycotoxin present in the sample. We show that 689 samples (96.8%) complied with the regulations set by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. AFs were found in four peanut-candy products, one peanut-flour product, one pistachio product, one Sichuan-pepper product, and one Coix seed product. All had exceeded the maximum levels of 15 parts per billion for peanut and 10 parts per billion for other food products. Furthermore, 14 RYR samples contained CIT above 5 parts per million, and one RYR tablet exceeded the maximum amount allowed. Instances of AFs in substandard Sichuan pepper and Coix seeds were first detected in Taiwan. Measures were taken by the relevant authorities to remove substandard products from the market in order to decrease consumer exposure to mycotoxin. Border control measures were applied to importing food commodities with a higher risk of mycotoxin contamination, such as peanut, Sichuan pepper, and RYR products.

26669648,"Provitamin A carotenoids (β-carotene, α-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin) contribute to the dietary intake of vitamin A and are associated with decreased risk of many chronic diseases. Besides their contents in foods, their bioaccessibility is of great interest since it represents the amount that will be absorbed in the gut. The aim of this study was to adopt, for the first time, the in vitro digestion model suitable for food, proposed in a consensus paper by Minekus et al. (2014), to assess the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from the fruits that are the major contributors to the intake of β-cryptoxanthin in Spain (orange, tangerine, red pepper, peach, watermelon, and persimmon) and loquat. The highest β-cryptoxanthin content and the lowest bioaccessibility was found in mandarin and loquat (13331.6 and 929.2 μg per 100 g respectively), whereas the highest contents of β-carotene and α-carotene were recorded in red pepper (1135.3 and 90.4 μg per 100 g respectively). The bioaccessibility of β-cryptoxanthin was similar to that of β-carotene (0.02-9.8% and 1-9.1%, respectively) and was higher than that of β-carotene in red pepper, watermelon and peach. α-Carotene bioaccessibility ranged between 0% and 4.6%. We discuss the critical factors for comparing our data: the form of the food being analyzed (raw/cooked/previously frozen, in the presence or absence of oil/fat) and the protocol for bioaccessibility assessment. Different food processing techniques may increase carotenoid bioaccessibility compared to raw food. However, given the difficulties encountered when comparing the results of studies on bioaccessibility, it seems logical to propose the application of the previously mentioned standardized in vitro protocol.

26590310,"Rotundone was initially identified as a grape-derived compound responsible for the peppery aroma of Shiraz wine varieties. It has subsequently been found in black and white pepper and several other spices. Because of its potent aroma, the molecular basis for rotundone formation is of particular relevance to grape and wine scientists and industry. We have identified and functionally characterized in planta a sesquiterpene synthase, VvGuaS, from developing grape berries, and have demonstrated that it produces the precursor of rotundone, α-guaiene, as its main product. The VvGuaS enzyme is a novel allele of the sesquiterpene synthase gene, VvTPS24, which has previously been reported to encode VvPNSeInt, an enzyme that produces a variety of selinene-type sesquiterpenes. This newly discovered VvTPS24 allele encodes an enzyme 99.5% identical to VvPNSeInt, with the differences comprising just 6 out of the 561 amino acid residues. Molecular modelling of the enzymes revealed that two of these residues, T414 and V530, are located in the active site of VvGuaS within 4 Å of the binding-site of the substrate, farnesyl pyrophosphate. Mutation of these two residues of VvGuaS into the corresponding polymorphisms in VvPNSeInt results in a complete functional conversion of one enzyme into the other, while mutation of each residue individually produces an intermediate change in the product profile. We have therefore demonstrated that VvGuaS, an enzyme responsible for production of the rotundone precursor, α-guaiene, is encoded by a novel allele of the previously characterized grapevine gene VvTPS24 and that two specific polymorphisms are responsible for functional differences between VvTPS24 alleles.

26483187,"Engineered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are implemented in food contact materials due to their powerful antimicrobial properties and so may enter the human food chain. Hence, it is desirable to develop easy, sensitive and fast analytical screening methods for the determination of AgNPs in complex biological matrices. This study describes such a method using solid sampling high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). A recently reported novel evaluation strategy uses the atomization delay of the respective GFAAS signal as significant indicator for AgNPs and thereby allows discrimination of AgNPs from ionic silver (Ag(+)) in the samples without elaborate sample pre-treatment. This approach was further developed and applied to a variety of biological samples. Its suitability was approved by investigation of eight different food samples (parsley, apple, pepper, cheese, onion, pasta, maize meal and wheat flour) spiked with ionic silver or AgNPs. Furthermore, the migration of AgNPs from silver-impregnated polypropylene food storage boxes to fresh pepper was observed and a mussel sample obtained from a laboratory exposure study with silver was investigated. The differences in the atomization delays (Δt(ad)) between silver ions and 20-nm AgNPs vary in a range from -2.01 ± 1.38 s for maize meal to +2.06 ± 1.08 s for mussel tissue. However, the differences were significant in all investigated matrices and so indicative of the presence/absence of AgNPs.

26427328,"Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is widely used in food flavor compounds analysis in majority for profiling volatile compounds. Based on such profiles conclusions are often drawn concerning the percentage composition of volatile compounds in particular food, spices or raw materials. This paper focuses on the usefulness of SPME for the profiling of volatile compounds from spices using black pepper as an example. SPME profiles obtained in different analytical conditions were compared to the profile of pepper volatiles obtained using hydrodistillation in Clevenger apparatus. The profiles of both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes of black pepper were highly dependent on sample weight (0.1 and 1g samples were tested), and extraction time (durations from 2 to 120min were tested), regardless of the SPME fiber used (PDMS and CAR/PDMS coatings were used). The characteristic phenomenon for extraction from dry ground pepper was the decrease of monoterpenes % share in volatiles with increasing extraction times, whereas at the same time the % contents of sesquiterpenes increased. Addition of water to ground pepper substantially changed extraction kinetics and mutual proportions of mono to sesquiterpenes compared to dry samples by minimizing changes in mono- to sesquiterpenes ratio in different extraction times. Obtained results indicate that SPME can be a fast extraction method for volatiles of black pepper. Short extraction times (2-10min) in conjunction with the fast GC analysis (2.1min) proposed here may offer fast alternative to hydrodistillation allowing black pepper terpenes characterization.

The adsorbent (Fe3O4@SiO2@GO-PEA) was then used in a magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of six organophosphorous pesticides (OPPs) including methyl parathion, fenitrothion, methidathion, ethion, methyl azinphos and coumaphos prior to gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus detection (GC-NPD). The fabricated adsorbent combines the advantages of superior adsorption capability of modified GO and magnetic separability of magnetite microparticles to provide high adsorption capacity, and easy isolation from sample solutions. The main experimental parameters affecting the extraction recovery of OPPs including extraction time, pH, adsorbent dosage, salt concentration, and desorption conditions were investigated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, linear responses were obtained in the concentration range of 0.06-200μgL(-1) with the determination coefficients (R(2)) between 0.9945 and 0.9996.

Five capsaicin metabolites purified from the ethyl acetate fraction of the capsaicin culture were identified as N-vanillylcarbamoylbutyric acid, N-vanillyl-9-hydroxy-8-methyloctanamide, ω-hydroxycapsaicin, 8-methyl-N-vanillylcarbamoyl-6(E)-octenoic acid, and 2-methyl-N-vanillylcarbamoyl-6(Z)-octenoic acid by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). The capsaicin metabolites in gochujang were confirmed and quantitated by selective multiple reaction monitoring detection after liquid chromatography electrospray ionization MS using the isolated compounds as external standards. On the basis of the structures of the capsaicin metabolites, it is proposed that capsaicin metabolites were converted by A. oryzae by ω-hydroxylation, alcohol oxidation, hydrogenation, isomerization, and α- and/or β-oxidation.

26044382,"Some steps of the QuEChERS method for the analysis of pesticides with GC-MS/MS in cereals and dried fruits were improved or simplified. For the latter, a mixing vessel with stator-rotor-system proved to be advantageous. The extraction procedure of dried fruits is much easier and safer than the Ultra Turrax and results in excellent validation data at a concentration level of 0.01mg/kg (116 of 118 analytes with recoveries in the range of 70-120%, 117 of 118 analytes with RSD <20%). After qualifying problematic lipophilic pesticides in fat-rich cereals (fat content >7%), predominantly organochlorines showed recoveries of <70% in quantification when the standard QuEChERS method with water was used. A second extraction was carried out analogous to the QuEChERS method, however, without the addition of water. With this simple modification, the problematic lipophilic pesticides, which had been strongly affected by the fat content of the commodities, could be determined with recoveries above 70% even at a concentration level of 0.01mg/kg. Moreover, a GC-MS/MS screening method for 120 pesticides at a concentration level of 0.01mg/kg was established by employing analyte protectants (ethylglycerol, gulonolactone, and sorbitol). The use of only one standardized calibration, made of an apple purée extract in combination with analyte protectants, allowed for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 120 pesticides in different matrix extracts (tomato, red pepper, sour cherries, dried apples, black currant powder, raisins, wheat flour, rolled oats, wheat germ). The analyte protectants leveled the differences in the matrix-induced protection effect of the analyzed extracts over a wide range.

Five extraction techniques, i.e., accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), ball mill extraction, ultrasonication, rinsing, and shaking, were quantitatively compared using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Rinsing of the surface wax layer of freeze-dried bell peppers with chloroform proved to be a relatively quick and easy method to efficiently extract the main n-alkanes C27, C29, C31, and C33. A combined cleanup and fractionation approach on Teflon-coated silica SPE columns resulted in clean chromatograms and gave reproducible results (recoveries 90-95 %). The GC-MS method was reproducible (R(2) = 0.994-0.997, peak area standard deviation = 2-5%) and sensitive (LODs, S/N = 3, 0.05-0.15 ng/μL). The total main n-alkane concentrations were in the range of 5-50 μg/g dry weight. Seed extractions resulted in much lower total amounts of extracted n-alkanes compared to flesh and surface extractions, demonstrating the need for further improvement of pre-concentration and cleanup. The method was applied to 131 pepper samples from four different countries, and by using the relative n-alkane concentration ratios, Dutch peppers could be discriminated from those of the other countries, with the exception of peppers from the same cultivar.

However, other proteins such as glycine dehydrogenase P subunit and phosphate transporter were identified as targets of carbonylation only in green fruits, whereas aconitase, ATPase β subunit, prohibitin, orfB protein, and cytochrome C oxidase, were identified only in red fruits.

25541091,"Herbs and spices are used worldwide as food flavoring, thus determination of their identity, origin, and quality is mandatory for safe human consumption. An analysis strategy based on separative (HS-SPME-GC-MS) and non-separative (HS-SPME-MS) approaches is proposed for the volatile fraction of herbs and spices, for quality control and to quantify the aromatic markers with a single analysis directly on the plant material as such. Eight-to-ten lots of each of the following herbs/spices were considered: cloves (Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & Perry), American peppertree (Schinus molle L.), black pepper and white pepper (Piper nigrum L.), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), sage (Salvia officinalis L.) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.). Homogeneity, origin, and chemotypes of the investigated lots of each herb/spice were defined by fingerprinting, through statistical elaboration with principal component analysis (PCA). Characterizing aromatic markers were directly quantified on the solid matrix through multiple headspace extraction-HS-SPME (MHS-SPME). Reliable results were obtained with both separative and non-separative methods (where the latter were applicable); the two were in full agreement, RSD% ranging from 1.8 to 7.7% for eugenol in cloves, 2.2-18.4% for carvacrol+thymol in thyme, and 3.1-16.8% for thujones in sage.

25495653,"This manuscript reports a new pesticide residue analysis method employing a microflow-liquid chromatography system coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (microflow-LC-ESI-QqQ-MS). This uses an electrospray ionization source with a narrow tip emitter to generate smaller droplets. A validation study was undertaken to establish performance characteristics for this new approach on 90 pesticide residues, including their degradation products, in three commodities (tomato, pepper, and orange). The significant benefits of the microflow-LC-MS/MS-based method were a high sensitivity gain and a notable reduction in matrix effects delivered by a dilution of the sample (up to 30-fold); this is as a result of competition reduction between the matrix compounds and analytes for charge during ionization. Overall robustness and a capability to withstand long analytical runs using the microflow-LC-MS system have been demonstrated (for 100 consecutive injections without any maintenance being required). Quality controls based on the results of internal standards added at the samples' extraction, dilution, and injection steps were also satisfactory. The LOQ values were mostly 5 μg kg(-1) for almost all pesticide residues. Other benefits were a substantial reduction in solvent usage and waste disposal as well as a decrease in the run-time. The method was successfully applied in the routine analysis of 50 fruit and vegetable samples labeled as organically produced.

25229184,"The effects of Chinese spices on the profiles of 17 heterocyclic amines (HAs) from seven HA categories were investigated in roast beef patties using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and principal component analysis. Three groups of HAs, imidazopyridines (PhIP, DMIP, and 1,5,6-TMIP), imidazoquinoxalines (MeIQx and 4,8-DiMeIQx), and β-carbolines (harman and norharman), were detected and quantified in all of the samples. The results demonstrated that the total HA and imidazopyridine profiles could clearly be affected by 1% pricklyash peel (14.1 ± 0.76 and 6.06 ± 0.32 ng/g), chilli (41.0 ± 0.01 and 23.0 ± 0.52 ng/g), and cumin (59.9 ± 2.44 and 31.1 ± 3.06 ng/g), in comparison with control values of 21.8 ± 2.40 and 14.3 ± 2.04 ng/g, respectively.

25175039,"An LC-MS/MS ""dilute and shoot"" method for the determination of 295 fungal and bacterial metabolites was optimized and validated according to the guidelines established in the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs of the European Commission (SANCO) document No. 12495/2011. Four different types of food matrices were chosen for validation: apple puree for infants (high water content), hazelnuts (high fat content), maize (high starch and low fat content) and green pepper (difficult or unique matrix). Method accuracy and precision was evaluated using spiked samples in five replicates at two concentration levels. Method trueness was demonstrated through participation in various proficiency tests. Although the method covers a total number of 331 analytes, validation data were acquired only for 295 analytes, either due to the non-availability of analytical standards or due other reasons described in this paper. Concerning the apparent recovery, the percentage of 295 analytes matching the acceptable recovery range of 70-120% lied down by SANCO varied from 21% in green pepper to 74% in apple puree at the highest spiking level. At the levels close to limit of quantification only 20-58% of the analytes fulfilled this criterion. The extent of matrix effects was strongly dependent on the analyte/matrix combination. In general, the lowest matrix effects were observed in apple puree (59% of analytes were not influenced by enhancement/suppression at all at the highest validation level). The highest matrix effects were observed in green pepper, where only 10% of analytes did not suffer from signal suppression/enhancement. The repeatability of the method was acceptable (RSD≤20) for 97% of all analytes in apple puree and hazelnuts, for 95% in maize and for 89% in green pepper. Concerning the trueness of the method, Z-scores were generally between -2 and 2, despite a broad variety of different matrices. Based on these results it can be concluded that quantitative determination of mycotoxins by LC-MS/MS based on a ""dilute and shoot"" approach is also feasible in case of complex matrices.

Except for one compound (capillary compound for blank), 43 compounds were identified in healthy and infected chili powder. Specifically, 31, 36, and 41 compounds were identified in healthy, medium-infected, and severely infected chili powder. Among these compounds, acetic acid (13.77%), propanal (2.477%), N-methylpyrrole (1.986%), and 2-methyl-propanal (1.768%) were leading volatiles in the healthy chili powder. In contrast, infected chili powder contained 9,12-octadecadienoic acid, ethyl ester (15.984%), acetic acid (11.249%), hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester (3.3%), N-methylpyrrole (3.221%), and 2-furanmethanol (2.629%) as major compounds. Trimethylamine and isosorbide were detected in both medium and severely infected chili, but not in healthy chili. This means that these compounds could be used as biomarkers to distinguish between healthy and infected chili. The proposed technique was applied to 12 commercial chili powders, and trimethylamine and isosorbide were detected in six samples. These results suggest that a contaminated chili that was added to a healthy one could be successfully identified by a combination of the SFSI and GC/MS.

We aimed to compare the characteristics of Cd uptake and translocation in low-Cd and high-Cd hot pepper cultivars by determining the subcellular locations and chemical forms of Cd, and its distribution among different plant organs. We conducted a hydroponic experiment to investigate the subcellular distribution and chemical forms of Cd in roots, stems, and leaves of a low-Cd (Yeshengchaotianjiao, YCT) and a high-Cd cultivar (Jinfuzaohuangjiao, JFZ). The results showed that the concentrations of Cd in almost all subcellular fractions of roots, and in all chemical forms in roots, were higher in YCT than in JFZ. Compared with YCT, JFZ had higher Cd concentrations in almost all subcellular fractions of stems and leaves, and higher Cd concentrations in almost all chemical forms in stems and leaves. Additionally, YCT had significantly higher total Cd accumulation but a lower Cd translocation rate compared with JFZ. In general, the results presented in this study revealed that root-to-shoot Cd translocation via the xylem is the key physiological processes determining the Cd accumulation level in stems and leaves of hot pepper plants. Immobilization of Cd by the cell walls of different organs is important in Cd detoxification and limiting the symplastic movement of Cd.

24236083,"The genus Capsicum is New World in origin and represents a complex of a wide variety of both wild and domesticated taxa. Peppers or fruits of Capsicum species rarely have been identified in the paleoethnobotanical record in either Meso- or South America. We report here confirmation of Capsicum sp. residues from pottery samples excavated at Chiapa de Corzo in southern Mexico dated from Middle to Late Preclassic periods (400 BCE to 300 CE). Residues from 13 different pottery types were collected and extracted using standard techniques. Presence of Capsicum was confirmed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/MS-MS Analysis. Five pottery types exhibited chemical peaks for Capsicum when compared to the standard (dihydrocapsaicin). No peaks were observed in the remaining eight samples. Results of the chemical extractions provide conclusive evidence for Capsicum use at Chiapas de Corzo during a 700 year period (400 BCE-300 CE). Presence of Capsicum in different types of culinary-associated pottery raises questions how chili pepper could have been used during this early time period. As Pre-Columbian cacao products sometimes were flavored using Capsicum, the same pottery sample set was tested for evidence of cacao using a theobromine marker: these results were negative. As each vessel that tested positive for Capsicum had a culinary use we suggest here the possibility that chili residues from the Chiapas de Corzo pottery samples reflect either paste or beverage preparations for religious, festival, or every day culinary use. Alternatively, some vessels that tested positive merely could have been used to store peppers. Most interesting from an archaeological context was the presence of Capsicum residue obtained from a spouted jar, a pottery type previously thought only to be used for pouring liquids.

The flavour attributes were analysed using headspace solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), sensory evaluation and electronic nose (e-nose) analysis. Cryogenic grinding resulted in minimal damage to the colour, flavour, and sensory attributes of the spices. Cryogenic grinding was also better than hammer milling at preserving the main potent aroma constituents, but the concentrations of the main aroma constituents were dramatically reduced after storing the samples at 4 °C for 6 months.

23726353,"A reliable and rapid method for the determination of multiple mycotoxins was developed using a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) based extraction procedure in highly pigmented and complex spice matrices, namely red chilli (Capsicum annum ssp.), black and white pepper (Piper nigrum ssp.). High-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used for the quantification and confirmation of 17 chemically diversified mycotoxins. Different extraction procedures were studied and optimized in order to obtain better recoveries. Mycotoxins were extracted from the hydrated spices using acidified acetonitrile (1% formic acid), followed by partitioning with NaCl and anhydrous MgSO4; excluding the use of dispersive-solid phase extraction. Significant matrix effect was compensated using the matrix matched calibration curves. Electrospray ionization at positive mode was applied to simultaneously detect all the mycotoxins in a single run time of 20min. Multiple reaction monitoring mode, choosing at least two abundant fragment ions per analyte was applied. Coefficients of determination obtained were in the range of 0.9844-0.9997. Recoveries (ranging from 75% to 117%) were in accordance with the performance criteria required by the European Commission. Intra-day reproducibility ranged from 4% to 22% for most of the mycotoxins. The limit of quantification ranged from 2.3 to 146μgkg(-1). The validated method was finally applied to screen mycotoxins in ten of each spice matrix. Aflatoxins, ochratoxin, fumonisins, sterigmatocystin and citrinin were among the detected analytes. Positive findings were further confirmed using relative ion intensities.

Packaging of the herbs in high- or low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) has proven to be ineffective in preventing a significant loss of volatile components on storage. This study investigates and compares the effectiveness of alternate high-barrier property packaging materials, namely, polyvinylidene chloride coated polyethylene terephthalate/casted polypropylene (PVDC coated PET/CPP) and polyethylene terephthalate/polyethylene terephthalate/aluminum foil/linear low-density polyethylene (PET/PET/Foil/LLDPE), in prevention of volatile compound loss from the three native herbs stored at ambient temperature for 6 months. Concentrations of major volatiles were monitored using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques. After 6 months of storage, the greatest loss of volatiles from lemon myrtle was observed in traditional LDPE packaging (87% loss) followed by storage in PVDC coated PET/CPP (58% loss) and PET/PET/Foil/LLDPE (loss of 23%). The volatile loss from anise myrtle and Tasmanian pepper leaf stored in PVDC coated PET/CPP and PET/PET/Foil/LLDPE packaging was <30%.

In this study, the anti-obesity effects of water extracts of seven Capsicum annuum L. varieties being Putgochu (Pca), Oyee gochu (Oca), Kwari putgochu (Kca), Green pepper (Gca), Yellow paprika (Yca), Red paprika (Rca) and Cheongyang gochu (Cca), were examined through the evaluation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA expression level in 3T3-L1 cells (mouse pre-adipocytes). After capsaicin elimination by chloroform defatting, freeze-dried powder of Cca was treated to 3T3-L1 cells and anti-obesity effects were examined by determining the LPL mRNA level using the RT-PCR method. Of the primary fractions, only proven fractions underwent secondary and tertiary refractionating to determine anti-obesity effects. From seven different Capsicum annuum L., there was a significant decrease of the LPL mRNA expression level of 50.9% in Cca treatment compared to the control group. A significant decrease of the LPL mRNA expression level was shown in primary fractions (Fr) 5 (36.2% decrease) and 6 (30.5% decrease) of the Cca water extracts. Due to the impurities checked by UPLC chromatography, Fr 5 and 6 were refractionated to determine the LPL mRNA expression level. Treatment of Fr 6-6 (35.8% decrease) and Fr 5-6 (35.3% decrease) showed a significant decrease in the LPL mRNA expression level. When analyzed using UPLC, major compounds of Fr 6-6 and Fr 5-6 were very similar. Subsequently, we refractionated Fr 6-6 and Fr 5-6 to isolate the major peak for structure elucidation. Treatment of Fr 5-6-1 (26.6% decrease) and Fr 6-6-1 (29.7% decrease) showed a significant decrease in the LPL mRNA expression level.

Palermo and in mature fruit of four cultivars (Lipari, C-116, Surrentino and Italverde) with different AsA concentrations. An inverse correlation was found between the expression of the biosynthetic genes and AsA concentrations, which could indicate that a feedback mechanism regulates AsA homeostasis in pepper fruits.

23581685,"In the last decade, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued several warnings and recalls for food products that exceed FDA standards for lead. Products containing chili peppers and salt were often suspected as sources of lead contamination, and included items such as candy that are routinely investigated. However, products such as hot sauces that contain similar ingredients have not been the focus of evaluations. This study quantified lead concentrations in imported hot sauces, evaluated product compliance to existing United States standards, and calculated potential dietary lead exposure for children using the Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model. Finally, recommendations for reducing the risk of lead exposure from hot sauces are provided. Twenty-five (25) bottles of imported hot sauces manufactured in Mexico and South America were purchased in Clark County, Nevada. All hot sauces were analyzed for lead concentrations, pH, and leaded packaging. Hot sauces were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and packaging was analyzed using x-ray fluorescence technology. Four brands of hot sauces (16%) exceeded 0.1 ppm lead, the current FDA action level for lead in candy. Hot sauces with lead concentrations >0.1 ppm lead contained salt and were manufactured in Mexico. Subsequent analysis of additional lots of hot sauces exceeding 0.1 ppm lead revealed inconsistent lead concentrations between and within manufacturer lots. The lead concentrations of the plastic hot sauce lids ranged from below the limit of detection to 2,028 ppm lead. There was no association between lead concentrations in hot sauces and pepper type. These results indicate the need for more rigorous screening protocols for products imported from Mexico, the establishment of an applicable standard for hot sauce, and resources to allow for the enforcement of existing food safety policies.

To gain a general and comparative characterization of chromoplast proteins, this study performed proteomic analysis of chromoplasts from six carotenoid-rich crops: watermelon, tomato, carrot, orange cauliflower, red papaya, and red bell pepper. Stromal and membrane proteins of chromoplasts were separated by 1D gel electrophoresis and analysed using nLC-MS/MS. A total of 953-2262 proteins from chromoplasts of different crop species were identified. Approximately 60% of the identified proteins were predicted to be plastid localized. Functional classification using MapMan bins revealed large numbers of proteins involved in protein metabolism, transport, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and redox in chromoplasts from all six species. Seventeen core carotenoid metabolic enzymes were identified. Phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, ζ-carotene desaturase, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 were found in almost all crops, suggesting relative abundance of them among the carotenoid pathway enzymes. Chromoplasts from different crops contained abundant amounts of ATP synthase and adenine nucleotide translocator, which indicates an important role of ATP production and transport in chromoplast development. Distinctive abundant proteins were observed in chromoplast from different crops, including capsanthin/capsorubin synthase and fibrillins in pepper, superoxide dismutase in watermelon, carrot, and cauliflower, and glutathione-S-transferease in papaya.

If the development of gallbladder cancer (GBC) in Chile is associated with a high level of consumption of aflatoxin-contaminated red chili peppers, such peppers from other countries having a high GBC incidence rate may also be contaminated with aflatoxins. We aimed to determine whether this might be the case for red chili peppers from Bolivia and Peru. A total of 7 samples (3 from Bolivia, 4 from Peru) and 3 controls (2 from China, 1 from Japan) were evaluated. Aflatoxins were extracted with acetonitrile:water (9:1, v/v) and eluted through an immuno-affinity column. The concentrations of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and then the detected aflatoxins were identified using HPLC-mass spectrometry. In some but not all of the samples from Bolivia and Peru, aflatoxin B1 or aflatoxins B1 and B2 were detected. In particular, aflatoxin B1 or total aflatoxin concentrations in a Bolivian samples were above the maximum levels for aflatoxins in spices proposed by the European Commission. Red chili peppers from Bolivia and Peru consumed by populations having high GBC incidence rates would appear to be contaminated with aflatoxins.

23124390,"Pepper fruit is typically red, but green, orange and yellow cultivars are gaining consumer acceptance. This color variation is mainly due to variations in carotenoid composition. Orange color in pepper can result from a number of carotenoid profiles, but its genetic basis is only partly known. We identified an EMS-induced orange-fruited mutant using the wild-type blocky red-fruited cultivar 'Maor' as progenitor. This mutant accumulates mainly β-carotene in its fruit, instead of the complex pattern of red and yellow carotenoids in 'Maor'. We identified an A(709) to G transition in the cDNA of β-CAROTENE HYDROXYLASE2 in the orange pepper and complete co-segregation of this single-nucleotide polymorphism with the mutated phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that β-CAROTENE HYDROXYLASE2 controls the orange mutation in pepper. Interestingly, the expression of β-CAROTENE HYDROXYLASE2 and additional carotenogenesis genes was elevated in the orange fruit compared with the red fruit, indicating possible feedback regulation of genes in the pathway. Because carotenoids serve as precursors for volatile compounds, we compared the volatile profiles of the two parents. The orange pepper contained more volatile compounds than 'Maor', with predominant elevation of norisoprenoids derived from β-carotene degradation, while sesquiterpenes predominated in the red fruit. Because of the importance of β-carotene as a provitamin A precursor in the human diet, the orange-fruited mutant might serve as a natural source for pepper fruit biofortification.

The process involves two simple steps. First, the homogenized samples are extracted and partitioned using an organic solvent and salt solution. Then, the supernatant is further extracted and cleaned using a dSPE technique. Final clear extracts of vegetables were concentrated under vacuum to near dryness and taken up into initial mobile phase (0.1% formic acid and 20% methanol). The separation and quantification of free low molecular weight polyphenols from the vegetable extracts was achieved by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) equipped with a phodiode array (PDA) detection system and a Trifunctional High Strength Silica capillary analytical column (HSS T3), specially designed for polar compounds. The performance of the method was assessed by studying the selectivity, linear dynamic range, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, trueness, and matrix effects.

22908857,"A rapid and simple nondestructive extraction (NDE) method that includes wiping off of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides has been developed to streamline sample pretreatment procedures conducted before chromatographic determination. Pesticide residues were extracted from green pepper surfaces by swabbing  them with absorbent cotton moistened with acetone or acetonitrile. After spraying of pesticides, the extraction rate decreased gradually, except for thiacloprid. Presumably, extraction rates depend on the physicochemical properties of pesticides, especially water solubility. It was thought that the applicability of the proposed method greatly depended on the systemic speed of each pesticide, and water solubility was placed as the index that was important to  making certain. Direct analysis of some insecticides persisting on sample surfaces has been possible only by extraction before chromatographic determination. These findings indicate strongly that the proposed NDE method has collateral conditions, but it appears promising for on-site pretreatment for pesticide residue analysis.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002212', 'D002851', 'D005506', 'D010573', 'D052616']","['Capsicum', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Solid Phase Extraction']",Rapid and simple analysis of pesticides persisting on green pepper surfaces swabbing with solvent-moistened cotton.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000295']","['chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'instrumentation']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22908857,2013
22813205,"The rapidly growing demand for organic food requires the availability of analytical tools enabling their authentication. Recently, metabolomic fingerprinting/profiling has been demonstrated as a challenging option for a comprehensive characterisation of small molecules occurring in plants, since their pattern may reflect the impact of various external factors. In a two-year pilot study, concerned with the classification of organic versus conventional crops, ambient mass spectrometry consisting of a direct analysis in real time (DART) ion source and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) was employed. This novel methodology was tested on 40 tomato and 24 pepper samples grown under specified conditions. To calculate statistical models, the obtained data (mass spectra) were processed by the principal component analysis (PCA) followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The results from the positive ionisation mode enabled better differentiation between organic and conventional samples than the results from the negative mode. In this case, the recognition ability obtained by LDA was 97.5% for tomato and 100% for pepper samples and the prediction abilities were above 80% for both sample sets. The results suggest that the year of production had stronger influence on the metabolomic fingerprints compared with the type of farming (organic versus conventional). In any case, DART-TOFMS is a promising tool for rapid screening of samples. Establishing comprehensive (multi-sample) long-term databases may further help to improve the quality of statistical classification models.","Food additives & contaminants.

22685169,"Integrative comparative analyses of transcript and metabolite levels from climacteric and nonclimacteric fruits can be employed to unravel the similarities and differences of the underlying regulatory processes. To this end, we conducted combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and heterologous microarray hybridization assays in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum; climacteric) and pepper (Capsicum chilense; nonclimacteric) fruits across development and ripening. Computational methods from multivariate and network-based analyses successfully revealed the difference between the covariance structures of the integrated data sets. Moreover, our results suggest that both fruits have similar ethylene-mediated signaling components; however, their regulation is different and may reflect altered ethylene sensitivity or regulators other than ethylene in pepper. Genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis were not induced in pepper fruits. Nevertheless, genes downstream of ethylene perception such as cell wall metabolism genes, carotenoid biosynthesis genes, and the never-ripe receptor were clearly induced in pepper as in tomato fruit. While signaling sensitivity or actual signals may differ between climacteric and nonclimacteric fruit, the evidence described here suggests that activation of a common set of ripening genes influences metabolic traits. Also, a coordinate regulation of transcripts and the accumulation of key organic acids, including malate, citrate, dehydroascorbate, and threonate, in pepper fruit were observed. Therefore, the integrated analysis allows us to uncover additional information for the comprehensive understanding of biological events relevant to metabolic regulation during climacteric and nonclimacteric fruit development.",Plant physiology,"['D002212', 'D018507', 'D018506', 'D053263', 'D017343', 'D018551', 'D053858', 'D055442', 'D055432', 'D010937', 'D012333', 'D020133', 'D013045', 'D059467']","['Capsicum', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genes, Plant', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Metabolome', 'Metabolomics', 'Plant Growth Regulators', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcriptome']",Integrative comparative analyses of transcript and metabolite profiles from pepper and tomato ripening and development stages uncovers species-specific patterns of network regulatory behavior.,"['Q000235', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000096', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000235']","['genetics', None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'biosynthesis', 'genetics', None, None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22685169,2012

With Sudan I as template, an ultra-thin MIP coating with about 0.55-μm thickness was obtained with homogeneous structure and controlled composition, due to the controllable radical growing and chain propagation in surface RAFT polymerization. The MIP-coated fibers were found with enhanced selectivity coefficients (3.0-6.5) to Sudan I-IV dyes in contrast with those reported in our previous work. Furthermore, the ultra-thin thickness of MIP coating was helpful to the effective elution of template and fast adsorption/desorption kinetics, so only about 18 min was needed for MIP-coated SPME operation.

Headspace analysis was performed by a Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometer (SIFT-MS). After blanching, (Z)-3-hexenal had a large significant decrease in concentration since it is a heat labile compound while most other volatiles did not change in concentration. The freezing process increased volatile levels in the puree only. Slow freeze peppers had higher levels of some LOX generated volatiles during storage than quick freeze. During frozen storage of blanched samples (E)-2-hexenal, (Z and E)-hexen-1-ol, and (E)-2-pentenal increased likely because of nonenzymatic autoxidation of fatty acids while other volatiles remained constant. In Raw Whole peppers, (Z)-3-hexenal, hexanal, and 2-pentylfuran were generated during storage likely because the LOX enzyme is still active during frozen storage. However, blanched samples had higher concentrations of (E)-2-hexenal, (Z and E)-hexen-1-ol, 1-penten-3-one, and (E)-2-heptenal because of enzymatic destruction of these volatiles in the raw samples. The levels of many of the volatiles in the raw samples, including (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z and E)-hexen-1-ol, hexanal, (E)-2-pentenal, and 2-pentylfuran, appeared to peak around 34 d after freezing.

Absolute threshold and JND were determined using 2 alternative forced-choice sensory tests tests. High-performance liquid chromatography technique was used to determine capsaicinoids concentration in samples used for sensory analysis. Sensory absolute threshold was 0.050 mg capsaicinoids/kg sample. Five JND values were determined using 5 reference solutions with different capsaicinoids concentration. JND values changed proportionally as capsaicinoids concentration of the reference sample solutions changed. Weber fraction remained stable for the first 4 reference capsaicinoid solutions (0.05, 0.11, 0.13, and 0.17 mg/kg) but changed when the most concentrated reference capsaicinoids solution was used (0.23 mg/kg). Quantification limit for instrumental analysis was 1.512 mg/kg capsaicinoids. Sensory methods employed in this study proved to be more sensitive than instrumental methods.

22098923,"An internal fruit rot disease of sweet peppers was first detected in Belgium in 2003. Research conducted mostly in Canada indicates that this disease is primarily caused by Fusarium lactis Pirotta. Ninety-eight Fusarium isolates obtained from diseased sweet peppers from Belgium, as well as from other countries (Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) were identified by sequencing the translation elongation factor 1α (EF). Of these 98 isolates, 13 were identified as F. oxysporum Schltdl., nine as F. proliferatum (Matsush.) Nirenberg and two belonged to clade 3 of the F. solani species complex. Of the 74 remaining isolates, the EF sequence showed 97% to 98% similarity to F. lactis. Of these isolates, the β-tubulin (TUB), calmodulin (CAM) and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) genes were also sequenced. Analysis of the combined sequences revealed that the 74 isolates share nine combined sequences that correspond to nine multilocus sequence types (STs), while the F. lactis neotype strain and one other strain, both isolated from figs, form a separate ST. Together, these 10 STs represent a monophyletic F. lactis species complex (FLASC). An unusually high level of genetic diversity was observed between (groups of) these STs. Two of them (ST5 and ST6) fulfilled the criteria for species recognition based on genealogical exclusivity and together represent a new monophyletic species lineage (FLASC-1). The seven other STs, together with the F. lactis neotype ST, form a paraphyletic species lineage in the African clade of the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (GFSC). From each of the 10 STs, the mycotoxin production was assessed using a multi-mycotoxin liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. Out of the 27 analyzed mycotoxins, beauvericin and fumonisins were detected in sweet pepper tissue and in maize kernels. The 10 STs clearly differed in the amount of mycotoxin produced, but there was only limited congruence between the production profile and the phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, the morphological characterization (based on mycelial growth rate and the length of macroconidia) showed distinct differences between the 10 STs, but again there was limited congruence with the phylogenetic results. In conclusion, the data presented in this study demonstrate that 75% of the isolates obtained from sweet pepper with internal fruit rot belong to a F. lactis species complex (FLASC), including a new FLASC-1 monophyletic species, and that the members of this complex display great genetic and phenotypic diversity.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D001530', 'D002147', 'D002170', 'D002212', 'D005670', 'D014644', 'D008969', 'D058885', 'D009183', 'D009426', 'D020648', 'D012319', 'D014404', 'D006113', 'D003313']","['Belgium', 'Calmodulin', 'Canada', 'Capsicum', 'Fusarium', 'Genetic Variation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multilocus Sequence Typing', 'Mycotoxins', 'Netherlands', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Tubulin', 'United Kingdom', 'Zea mays']",Genetic diversity and mycotoxin production of Fusarium lactis species complex isolates from sweet pepper.,"[None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235']","[None, 'genetics', None, 'microbiology', 'genetics', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22098923,2012

The study involved the analysis of 97 pesticides, in five matrices (tomato, pepper, zucchini, orange and leek) and at three concentration levels (20, 50 and 100 μg kg(-1)). Aspects concerning optimization of the search parameters, sensitivity, matrix effects, efficiency of the algorithm search, usefulness of fragment ions, etc., are evaluated in deep. Sensitivity requirements have been identified as the main obstacle affecting the automatic identification of pesticides, especially in complex matrices, where the ionization suppression reduces the detectability of analytes. In addition, we have detected some failures in the software used for automatic data processing in terms of analysis of isobaric compounds, use of isotopic clusters, spectral deconvolution and data processing speed that hamper the correct identification in some pesticide/matrix combinations. These drawbacks should be improved in the future for its effective implementation in routine residue analysis.",Journal of chromatography.

21549057,"Aflatoxin contamination and mold proliferation in three hot pepper hybrids (Sky Red, Maha, and Wonder King) were studied during 5 months of storage at three temperatures (20, 25, and 30°C) and under different packaging conditions (low-density polyethylene bags and jute bags). The presence of aflatoxins in hot pepper samples was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with a UV-Vis detector. Sampling for analysis of aflatoxins, total mold counts, and Aspergillus counts was carried out at 0, 50, 100, and 150 days of storage. Hot peppers packed in jute bags were more susceptible to aflatoxin contamination than those packed in polyethylene bags; aflatoxin concentrations were 75% higher in peppers stored in jute bags. The effect of storage temperature resulted in aflatoxin concentrations that were 61% higher in hot peppers stored at 25 and 30°C than in those stored at 20°C. Of the three pepper hybrids, Wonder King was more susceptible to aflatoxin contamination, with a maximum of 1.50 μg/kg when packed in jute bags and stored at 25°C for 150 days. However, no sample exceeded the maximum permitted level for total aflatoxins in spices established by European Union regulations (10 μg/kg). Total mold counts and Aspergillus counts increased with storage duration, but all counts were significantly lower in peppers stored in polyethylene bags.

Volatiles were also measured before and after 1.5, 2.5, 3, 6, and 9 mo of frozen storage at -15 °C. The concentration of all lipoxygenase-derived compounds was significantly higher in unblanched jalapeño peppers compared to enzyme inhibited peppers. The maximum concentration of (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, and hexanal was detected at about 1.2, 1.5, and 1.5 min after tissue disruption, respectively. A decrease in (Z)-3-hexenal and an increase in dimethyl sulfide and methylbutanal occurred in blanched compared to stannous chloride-treated peppers due to heat. Frozen storage resulted in no major changes in the lipoxygenase-derived volatiles of whole and pureed blanched peppers after 9 mo. However, in whole unblanched peppers a gradual decrease of (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, hexanal, hexenol, and hexanol was observed over time; whereas in pureed unblanched peppers these compounds increased, reached maximum concentration, and then decreased. Similarly, the minor volatiles 2-pentenal, 1-penten-3-one, (E)-2-heptenal, (E)-2-octenal, and (E)-2-nonenal showed an initial increase followed by a decline in both whole and pureed unblanched peppers.

21535519,"The carotenoid patterns of fully ripe fruits from 12 Bolivian accessions of the Andean peppers Capsicum baccatum (ají) and C. pubescens (rocoto) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-photodiode array detector (PDA)-mass spectrometry (MS). We include 2 California Wonder cultivars as C. annuum controls. A total of 16 carotenoids were identified and differences among species were mostly found at the quantitative level. Among red-fruited genotypes, capsanthin was the main carotenoid in the 3 species (25% to 50% contribution to carotenoid fraction), although ajíes contained the lowest contribution of this carotenoid. In addition, the contribution of capsanthin 5,6-epoxide to total carotenoids in this species was high (11% to 27%) in comparison to rocotos and red C. annuum. Antheraxanthin and violaxanthin were, in general, the next most relevant carotenoids in the red Andean peppers (6.1% to 10.6%). Violaxanthin was the major carotenoid in yellow-/orange-fruited genotypes of the 3 species (37% to 68% total carotenoids), although yellow rocotos were characterized by lower levels (<45%). Cis-violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and lutein were the next most relevant carotenoids in the yellow/orange Andean peppers (5% to 14%). As a whole, rocotos showed the highest contributions of provitamin A carotenoids to the carotenoid fraction. In terms of nutritional contribution, both ajíes and rocotos provide a remarkable provitamin A activity, with several accessions showing a content in retinol equivalents higher than California Wonder controls. Furthermore, levels of lutein in yellow/orange ajíes and rocotos were clearly higher than California Wonder pepper (≥1000 μg·100/g). Finally, the Andean peppers, particularly red ajíes, can be also considered as a noticeable source of capsanthin, the most powerful antioxidant compound among pepper carotenoids. Practical Application: Capsicum peppers are known for their content in carotenoids, although there is no information about 2 species with Andean origin: ajíes and rocotos.

An optimized analytical method for determination of HT-2 toxin and T-2 toxin using capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection and another method for determination of DON by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in paprika was developed. The method for determination of HT-2 toxin and T-2 toxin that gave the best recoveries involved extraction of the sample with acetonitrile-water (84:16, v/v), clean-up by solid-phase extraction on a cartridge made of different sorbent materials followed by a further clean-up in immunoaffinity column that was specific for the two toxins. The solvent was changed and the eluate was derivatized with pentafluoropropionic anhydride and injected into the GC system. The limits of detection (LOD) for T-2 and HT-2 toxins were 7 and 3 μg/kg, respectively, and the recovery rates for paprika spiked with 1000 μg toxin/kg were 71.1% and 80.1% for HT-2 and T-2 toxins, respectively. For DON determination, the optimized method consisted of extraction with acetonitrile-water (84:16, v/v) solution followed by a solid-phase extraction clean-up process in a cartridge made of different sorbent compounds.

21514607,"A comprehensive study on morphology and biochemical compounds of 32 Capsicum spp. accessions has been performed. Accessions represented four pepper species, Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, Capsicum chinense and Capsicum baccatum which were selected by their variation in morphological characters such as fruit color, pungency and origin. Major metabolites in fruits of pepper, carotenoids, capsaicinoids (pungency), flavonoid glycosides, and vitamins C and E were analyzed and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that composition and level of metabolites in fruits varied greatly between accessions and was independent of species and geographical location. Fruit color was determined by the accumulation of specific carotenoids leading to salmon, yellow, orange, red and brown colored fruits. Levels of both O- and C-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin and apigenin varied strongly between accessions. All non-pungent accessions were devoid of capsaicins, whereas capsaicinoid levels ranged from 0.07 up to 80 mg/100g fr. wt. in fruit pericarp. In general, pungent accessions accumulated the highest capsaicinoid levels in placenta plus seed tissue compared to pericarp. The non-pungent capsaicinoid analogs, capsiates, could be detected at low levels in some pungent accessions. All accessions accumulated high levels of vitamin C, up to 200 mg/100g fr. wt. The highest vitamin E concentration found was 16 mg/100g fr. wt.

20965529,"2-Methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine (MIBP) contributes a bell pepper aroma to many grape cultivars and has a reported aroma threshold of ∼2 ng L(-1) in water. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) develop a procedure using headspace solid phase micro-extraction combined with GC-MS in the selected ion monitoring mode (HS-SPME-GC-MS-SIM) for analysis of MIBP in grape berries, and (2) determine the location of MIBP biosynthesis in grapevines by approach grafting clusters of Vitis vinifera L. cvs Cabernet Sauvignon and Muscat blanc onto each other. The soluble solids and pH of the grape juice/homogenate matrix from different grape berry developmental stages influenced the method precision; therefore, quantification via the method of standard addition was used. Using our developed method, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of MIBP were 0.1 ng L(-1) and 2 ng L(-1), respectively, measured in a model juice and non-MIBP containing Chardonnay juice. Spiked recoveries averaged between 91% and 112% in Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir homogenates and the overall relative standard deviation was less than 10%. The method was used to analyze MIBP in 29 grape cultivars and in fruit from clusters grafted to Cabernet Sauvignon or Muscat vines. Quantifiable levels were found only in Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc and Semillon, providing information on the genetic connection for the occurrence of MIBP in grapes. No MIBP was detected in the berries of Muscat blanc clusters grafted onto Cabernet Sauvignon vines when sampled at fruit maturity. MIBP was detected in all berries of Cabernet Sauvignon regardless the graft configuration.

In this article, we describe the finding that a methanol extract of dry long pepper (Piper longum L.) fruits is phytotoxic to lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seedlings. The bioassay-guided fractionation and purification of the crude extract led to isolation of sarmentine (1), a known compound, as the active principle. Phytotoxicity of 1 was examined with a variety of seedlings of field crops and weeds. Results indicated that 1 was a contact herbicide and possessed broad-spectrum herbicidal activity. Moreover, a series of sarmentine analogues were then synthesized to study the structure-activity relationship (SAR). SAR studies suggested that phytotoxicity of sarmentine and its analogues was specific due to chemical structures, i.e., the analogues of the acid moiety of 1 were active, but the amine and its analogues were inactive; the ester analogues and amide analogues with a primary amine of 1 were also inactive. In addition, quantification of 1 from different resources of the dry P. longum fruits using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed a wide variation, ranging from almost zero to 0.57%.

Two different commercial sweet pepper cultivars were inoculated with two different Fusarium proliferatum isolates that were sampled from diseased peppers. After 10 days of incubation at 20 °C in a closed container, the lesion caused by the fungal infection was dissected. Around the lesion, up to three concentric rings of pepper fruit tissue with a width of 5 mm were cut out and analyzed using a multimycotoxin LC-MS/MS method. The analyses resulted in the detection of beauvericin and fumonisins B(1), B(2), and B(3). Beauvericin was detected only in the lesions (95%), and the levels varied between 67 and 73800 μg/kg. Fumonisins B(1), B(2), and B(3) were detected in the lesions and in the surrounding tissue, indicating migration of these toxins into healthy parts of the sweet pepper. In the lesion the fumonisin B(1) level varied between 690 and 104000 μg/kg. Even in the outer ring fumonisin B(1) was still present. Mostly it was present at a lower level than in the lesion, with a maximum level of 556 μg/kg.

20730643,"A rapid, simple and sensitive multi-residue method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 69 pesticides in fruit and vegetables using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The samples were extracted following the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method known as QuEChERS. Mass spectrometric conditions were individually optimised for each analyte in order to achieve maximum sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Using the developed chromatographic conditions, 69 pesticides can be separated in less than 17 min. Two selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays were used for each pesticide to obtain simultaneous quantification and identification in one run. With this method in SRM mode, more than 150 pesticides can be analysed and quantified, but their confirmation is not possible in all cases according to the European regulations on pesticide residues. Nine common representative matrices (zucchini, melon, cucumber, watermelon, tomato, garlic, eggplant, lettuce and pepper) were selected to investigate the effect of different matrices on recovery and precision. Mean recoveries ranged from 70% to 120%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20% for all the pesticides. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of more than 2000 vegetable samples from the extensive greenhouse cultivation in the province of Almeria, Spain, during one year. The methodology combines the advantages of both QuEChERS and LC-MS/MS producing a very rapid, sensitive, accurate and reliable procedure that can be applied in routine analytical laboratories. The method was validated and accredited according to UNE-EN-ISO/IEC 17025:2005 international standard (accreditation number 278/LE1027).","Food additives & contaminants.

20707309,"Environmental factors affecting degradation of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP, ""green pepper aroma"") in wine grapes (V. vinifera) are widely studied, but the degradation pathway is not defined. We hypothesized that IBMP is demethylated to 3-isobutyl-2-hydroxypyrazine (IBHP) during fruit maturation effectively reversing the final putative step of IBMP biosynthesis. A quantification method for IBHP was developed using solid-phase extraction coupled to one- or two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a recovery of ca. 80%. IBMP and IBHP in bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) and V. vinifera (cv. 'Cabernet Franc', 'Riesling', 'Pinot noir') were then measured at different maturities. IBMP and IBHP were inversely correlated in both bell peppers (R2=0.958) and Cabernet Franc grapes (R2=0.998) over a range of maturities. In bell peppers, we observed a significant decline in IBMP (125 to 15 ng/mL) and increase in IBHP (undetectable to 42 ng/mL) during ripening.

20492299,"The present study aimed to investigate the effect of piperine, a major component of black pepper, on the oral exposure of fexofenadine in rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters of fexofenadine were determined in rats following an oral (10 mg/kg) or intravenous (5 mg/kg) administration of fexofenadine in the presence and absence of piperine (10 or 20 mg/kg, given orally). Compared to the control group given fexofenadine alone, the combined use of piperine increased the oral exposure (AUC) of fexofenadine by 180% to 190% while there was no significant change in C(max) and T(1/2) of fexofenadine in rats. The bioavailability of fexofenadine was increased by approximately 2-folds via the concomitant use of piperine. Furthermore, T(max) tends to be increased which might be attributed to the delayed gastric emptying in the presence of piperine. In contrast, piperine did not alter the intravenous pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine, implying that piperine may increase mainly the gastrointestinal absorption of fexofenadine rather than reducing hepatic extraction. In conclusion, piperine significantly enhanced the oral exposure of fexofenadine in rats likely by the inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated cellular efflux during the intestinal absorption, suggesting that the combined use of piperine or piperine-containing diet with fexofenadine may require close monitoring for potential drug-diet interactions.",Journal of food science,"['D020168', 'D000470', 'D000818', 'D052117', 'D001682', 'D002851', 'D004791', 'D018565', 'D005746', 'D006207', 'D039563', 'D007408', 'D008297', 'D029222', 'D010880', 'D053284', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D016593']","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Alkaloids', 'Animals', 'Benzodioxoles', 'Biological Availability', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Gastric Emptying', 'Half-Life', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists, Non-Sedating', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Male', 'Piper nigrum', 'Piperidines', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Terfenadine']","Effect of piperine, a major component of black pepper, on the intestinal absorption of fexofenadine and its implication on food-drug interaction.","['Q000037', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000008', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000008']","['antagonists & inhibitors', 'pharmacology', None, 'pharmacology', None, None, 'pharmacology', None, 'drug effects', None, 'administration & dosage', 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', None, None, 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20492299,2010

19735194,"Capsicum fruit, a popular spice as chili pepper, is an important ingredient of the formulations used in traditional medicines. Moreover, Capsicum fruit is listed as an official drug in several pharmacopoeias. Capsaicin, the most abundant component in Capsicum fruit, exhibits its therapeutic and adverse effects in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the known capsaicin content is the prerequisite for optimizing any formulation based on Capsicum fruit as a crude drug. We studied 16 samples of Capsicum fruits grown at different altitudes in Nepal and determined their capsaicin content by high-performance liquid chromatography. The capsaicin content was found to range from 2.19 to 19.73 mg/g of dry weight of Capsicum fruits. Capsaicin content in pericarp was found to be higher than in seeds. No correlation was found between the shape or size of the fruits and its capsaicin content. Our findings indicate that many of the formulations prepared from Capsicum fruit, even as described in pharmacopoeias, may vary in their strength, therapeutic activity, and possible side effects if the capsaicin content in Capsicum fruit is not standardized.",Journal of medicinal food,"['D002211', 'D002212', 'D002851', 'D005638', 'D009390']","['Capsaicin', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fruit', 'Nepal']",High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of capsaicin content in 16 Capsicum fruits from Nepal.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19735194,2009

Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) was used as a template molecule. A molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedure was developed for further application in the analysis of FB. The performance of the MIP throughout the clean-up of spiked bell pepper, rice and corn flake sample extracts was compared with the results obtained when using non-imprinted polymer, C(18), strong anion exchange and immunoaffinity sorbents. Extracts were analysed for FB with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after clean-up. Depending on the food matrix and the concentration range of the fumonisins, recoveries after MISPE varied from 62 to 86%, from 62 to 83%, and from 67 to 81% for fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)), fumonisin B(2) (FB(2)) and fumonisin B(3) (FB(3)), respectively. The selectivity of the synthesized MIP for mycotoxins belonging to the group of FB was confirmed by evaluating cross-reactivity from analogue structures and other mycotoxins. Analysis of 39 naturally contaminated samples (corn flakes) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry indicated that the synthesized MIP could be an excellent alternative for clean-up and pre-concentration of FB in food samples. Pearson correlations between immunoaffinity clean-up and MISPE were calculated and amounted to 0.923 for FB(1), 0.808 for FB(2), and 0.759 for FB(3). It was shown that the developed MIP could be reused more than 50 times.

19603130,"This study was aimed to assess the levels of selected heavy metals and pesticides in soil and plant products from an agricultural area of Belgrade, Serbia and to indicate possible sources and risks of contamination. Soil, vegetable, and fruit samples from the most important agricultural city areas were collected from July to November of 2006. Metal contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, whereas pesticide residues were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after extraction performed using solid-phase microextraction technique. Soil characterization based on the determination of selected physical and chemical properties revealed heterogeneous soils belonging to different soil groups. The concentrations of lead, cadmium, copper, and zinc in soil samples do not exceed the limits established by national and international regulations. Residues of the herbicide atrazine were detected in three soil samples, with levels lower than the relevant limit. The presence of other herbicides, namely prometryn, chloridazon, acetochlor, flurochloridone, and napropamide, was registered in some soil samples as well. Among the insecticides investigated in the soil, fenitrothion and chlorpyrifos were the only ones detected. In most of the investigated vegetable samples from the Obrenovac area, Pb and Cd contents are higher in comparison with the maximum levels, indicating the emission of coal combustion products from local thermal power plants as a possible source of contamination. Residue levels of some herbicides and insecticides (metribuzin, trifluralin, pendimethalin, bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos, and cypermethrin) determined in tomato, pepper, potato, and onion samples from Slanci, Ovca, and Obrenovac areas are even several times higher than the maximum residue levels.

19021793,"Farmstead Cheddar cheeses with natural bandage wrappings have a distinctive flavor profile that is appealing to many consumers. An earthy/bell pepper (EBP) flavor has been previously recognized in some of these cheeses. This study characterized the alkylmethoxypyrazine compounds causing EBP flavor in Farmstead Cheddar cheeses. Eight cheeses were divided into inner, outer, rind, and wrapper sections, and tested for descriptive sensory and instrumental analyses. To assess reproducibility of EBP flavor, cheeses from the same facilities were purchased and tested after 6 and 12 mo. EBP flavor was detected in four out of 8 Farmstead Cheddar cheeses by a trained sensory panel. 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine were identified as the main sources of EBP flavor in these cheeses by GC/O and GC/MS. In general, those alkylmethoxypyrazines were prevalent in the wrapper (106 to 730 ppb) and rind (39 to 444 ppb) sections of the cheeses. They were either not detected in inner and outer sections of the cheeses or were present at low concentrations. These results suggest that 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine are formed near the surface of the cheeses and migrate into the cheese during ripening. Threshold values in water and whole milk were 1 and 16 ppt for 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine, and 0.4 and 2.3 ppt for 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, respectively.

Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets.

Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to assess the effects of cooking on the micellarisation of beta-carotene, lycopene, beta-cryptoxanthin and lutein from courgette (zucchini), red pepper and tomato; and, to a minor extent, investigate uptake of lutein by Caco-2 cells from micellar fractions obtained from raw and cooked courgettes. Both raw and cooked vegetables were subjected to an in vitro digestion procedure. beta-Carotene levels were significantly decreased in the digesta from each vegetable after boiling, grilling, microwave-cooking, or steaming, however all of the cooking methods enhanced beta-carotene transfer to micelles. Carotenoid micellarisation ranged from 1.7% to 100% depending on the food, carotenoid, and the cooking method tested. Grilling and microwave-cooking were generally the most detrimental on the transfer of xanthophyll carotenoids, namely beta-cryptoxanthin, to the micelles. Caco-2 cells absorbed greater amounts of lutein from the micelles of microwave-cooked courgettes than those that were raw, boiled, grilled, or steamed.

Despite the fruits' economic importance and decades of research, the regulation of the content of capsaicinoids in individual fruits is not completely elucidated, and no agricultural cultivation of chili of defined pungency is assured. Precursor candidates of the fatty acid moiety of the capsaicinoids, especially for the unique 8-methyl- trans-6-nonenoic acid, were examined.

Fruit chlorophyll concentration was approximately 14-fold higher in black fruit in comparison to violet fruit that contained relatively little chlorophyll. Beta-carotene, lutein, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin carotenoid concentrations in black fruit were also significantly greater in comparison to violet fruit. High concentrations of delphinidin in combination with chlorophyll and accessory carotenoid pigments produced the characteristic black pigmentation observed in fruits and leaves of selected genotypes. Anthocyanins were accumulated in the outer mesocarp of violet and black fruit and in the palisade and mesophyll cells of black leaves.

Several classes of compounds belonging to different chemical families (triazines, organophosphorous, carbamates, phenylureas, neonicotinoids, etc.) were carefully chosen to cover a wide range of applications in the environmental field. Excellent chromatographic separation was achieved by the use of narrow accurate mass windows (0.05 Da) in a 30 min interval. Accurate mass measurements were always below 2 ppm error for all the pesticides studied. A table compiling the accurate masses for 101 compounds together with the accurate mass of several fragment ions is included. At least the accurate mass for one main fragment ion for each pesticide was obtained to achieve the minimum of identification points according to the 2002/657/EC European Decision, thus fulfilling the EU point system requirement for identification of contaminants in samples. The method was validated with vegetable samples. Calibration curves were linear and covered two orders of magnitude (from 5 to 500 microg/L) for most of the compounds studied. Instrument detection limits (LODs) ranged from 0.04 to 150 microg/kg in green-pepper samples.

17728301,"Ripe pepper (Capsicum sp.) fruits can display a range of colours from white to deep red. To understand better the regulatory mechanisms of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathways that underlie these ripening colours, Capsicum varieties that show seven different fully ripe colour types were analysed. The levels and composition of the carotenoid accumulation in these samples at different stages of ripening were measured, and the resulting data were analysed in conjunction with the expression patterns of the carotenoid biosynthetic genes. It was found that red peppers accumulate increasing levels of total carotenoids during ripening, whereas non-red peppers accumulate lower levels of total carotenoids of varying composition. The expression levels of the phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, and capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (Ccs) genes are high in peppers with high levels of total carotenoid, whereas one or two of these genes are not expressed in peppers with lower levels of total carotenoid. Surprisingly, it was found that the Ccs gene is present in two Capsicum varieties whose ripe colour is yellow. This gene has never previously been shown to be present in yellow peppers. Sequence analyses of the Ccs gene further revealed two structural mutations in yellow peppers that may result in either a premature stop-codon or a frame-shift.

The analytical method used was able to determine the pungency of genotypes that, using other methods, would have been classified as non-pungent. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin contents varied largely among families, and families did not respond similarly in producing these capsaicinoids when their fruits were grown in spring and summer, with some families showing no increase, whereas in others, the increase was more than 2-fold. Heterosis for the pungency trait, assessed by the capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin contents in fruits, was found, indicating the existence of epistasis, over-dominance, or dominance complementation. Non-pungent parent alleles contributed to the capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin contents since transgressive segregation did occur.

17580875,"'Black pepper' aroma and flavor is important to some Australian Shiraz red wine styles but the aroma compounds involved have yet to be identified, and no objective analytical method to assess 'pepper' grape aromas is available to date. Samples of potentially 'spicy'/'peppery' grapes were obtained from vineyards in South Australia and Victoria over two vintages. The important sensory attributes of the grapes, including the aroma descriptor 'pepper', were rated by a sensory panel. The sensory study revealed a strong correlation between the intensity of 'pepper' aroma and the intensity of 'pepper' flavor perceived on the palate. The grape homogenates were analyzed by static headspace GC-MS using a cool inlet system. Vectors obtained by analysis of over 13 000 individual mass spectra per grape sample were then subjected to multivariate analyses. Both principal component analysis and partial least-squares regression were used to develop multivariate models based on mass spectra and aroma descriptors to explain the intensity of the rating of the 'pepper' character. Corresponding differences in mass spectra and aroma were observed among vineyards and from the same vineyards in different years. Additional optimization of the methodology enabled selection of a single region of the GC-MS chromatogram that allowed prediction of 'pepper' aroma intensity with a correlation coefficient >0.98 and led to the identification of alpha-ylangene, a tricyclic sesquiterpene. To assess the potential of alpha-ylangene as a marker for this sensory characteristic, a method for alpha-ylangene analysis of grapes and wine using HS-SPME-GC-MS was developed. Although not a significant aroma compound by itself, alpha-ylangene was a satisfactory marker for the 'pepper' aroma in grapes and wine, and its concentration showed similar discrimination between 'peppery' vineyards and vintages as that obtained using the multivariate models. Despite its presence in grapes, we could not detect alpha-ylangene in wine.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D005638', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D009812', 'D029222', 'D012717', 'D013649', 'D027843', 'D014835']","['Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Odorants', 'Piper nigrum', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Taste', 'Vitis', 'Volatilization']",Identification and quantification of a marker compound for 'pepper' aroma and flavor in shiraz grape berries by combination of chemometrics and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.,"['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17580875,2007
17562464,"With the public perception that synthetic pesticides leave harmful residues in crop produce for human consumption, there has been increased interest in using natural products for pest control. The potential of using fruit extracts of hot pepper for controlling the cabbage looper, Trichopulsia ni (Hübner) and spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch is explored in this investigation. Crude extracts from fruits of Capsicum chinense, C. frutescens, C. baccatum, and C. annuum, were prepared and tested under laboratory conditions for their insecticidal and acaricidal performance. Mortality was greatest (94%) when fruit extract of accession PI-593566 (C. annuum) was sprayed on larvae of the cabbage looper, while crude extracts of accessions PI-241675 (C. frutescens) and PI-310488 (C. annuum) were repellent to the spider mite. We investigated differences in chemical composition of the crude fruit extracts that may explain the observed differences in mortality and repellency between accessions. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry spectrometric analysis revealed that capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, the pungent components of pepper fruit, were not correlated with toxicity or repellency, indicating that the two capsaicinoids are not likely related to the efficacy of pepper fruit extracts. Major compounds in hot pepper fruit extracts were detected and identified as pentadecanoic acid methyl ester, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, and octadecanoic acid methyl ester. Spectrometric analysis and toxicity to cabbage looper larvae revealed that pentadecanoic acid methyl ester is likely related to cabbage looper mortality. However, the concentration of pentadecanoic acid methyl ester in some accessions was insufficient to explain the observed mortality of cabbage looper and repellency of spider mite. Fruit extracts of accessions PI-593566 (C. annuum) and PI-241675 (C. frutescens) could be useful for managing populations of cabbage loopers and spider mites, which could reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides. Further study is needed to investigate performance of hot pepper extracts under ultra-violet light and field conditions.","Journal of environmental science and health. Part.

The input of some food groups (cereals, vegetables, fruits, milk and dairy, meat and meat products, fish) most responsible for major and minor contributions to the daily intake of these molecules was evaluated. Furthermore the contribution to the dietary intake of beta-carotene and lutein of the most consumed vegetables in the market basket of the Italian total diet (beets, brassica vegetables, carrots, chicory, courgette (zucchini), green beans, lettuce, peas, pepper, spinach, tomatoes) was also investigated. Vitamin A daily intake was 855 mg/person/day. The vegetables food group made the greatest contribution (37%), followed by the meat and meat products food group (23%). The Italian total diet provided 14.3 mg/person/day of carotenoids; lycopene was the highest (7.4 mg/day), followed by lutein + zeaxanthin (4 mg/day), beta-carotene (2.6 mg/day), alpha-carotene (0.15 mg/day), and beta-cryptoxanthin (0.17 mg/day).

17041029,"The U-box motif is a conserved domain found in the diverse isoforms of E3 ubiquitin ligase in eukaryotes. From water-stressed hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv Pukang) plants, we isolated C. annuum putative U-box protein 1 (CaPUB1), which encodes a protein containing a single U-box motif in its N-terminal region. In vitro ubiquitination and site-directed mutagenesis assays revealed that CaPUB1 possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and that the U-box motif was indeed essential for its enzyme activity. RNA gel-blot analysis showed that CaPUB1 mRNA was induced rapidly by a broad spectrum of abiotic stresses, including drought, high salinity, cold temperature, and mechanical wounding, but not in response to ethylene, abscisic acid, or a bacterial pathogen, suggesting its role in the early events in the abiotic-related defense response. Because transgenic work was extremely difficult in hot pepper, in this study we overexpressed CaPUB1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to provide cellular information on the function of this gene in the development and plant responses to abiotic stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively expressed the CaPUB1 gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter had markedly longer hypocotyls and roots and grew more rapidly than the wild type, leading to an early bolting phenotype. Microscopic analysis showed that 35S::CaPUB1 roots had increased numbers of small-sized cells, resulting in disordered, highly populated cell layers in the cortex, endodermis, and stele. In addition, CaPUB1-overexpressing plants displayed increased sensitivity to water stress and mild salinity. These results indicate that CaPUB1 is functional in Arabidopsis cells, thereby effectively altering cell and tissue growth and also the response to abiotic stresses. Comparative proteomic analysis showed that the level of RPN6 protein, a non-ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome complex, was significantly reduced in 35SCaPUB1 seedlings as compared to the wild type. Pull-down and ubiquitination assays demonstrated that RPN6 interacted physically with CaPUB1 and was ubiquitinated in a CaPUB1-dependent manner in vitro. Although the physiological function of CaPUB1 is not yet clear, there are several possibilities for its involvement in a subset of physiological responses to counteract dehydration and high-salinity stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings.",Plant physiology,"['D020816', 'D000595', 'D017360', 'D002212', 'D049109', 'D018076', 'D015180', 'D010450', 'D004926', 'D008969', 'D010641', 'D010940', 'D030821', 'D040901', 'D012441', 'D029701', 'D016415', 'D019032', 'D044767']","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Capsicum', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Endopeptidases', 'Escherichia coli', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Proteomics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",Heterologous expression and molecular and cellular characterization of CaPUB1 encoding a hot pepper U-Box E3 ubiquitin ligase homolog.,"[None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'genetics', 'enzymology', None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', 'genetics', None, None, 'chemistry', 'cytology', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17041029,2007
17031752,"The influence of soil contamination by inorganic and organic arsenic compounds on uptake, accumulation, and transformation of arsenic in pepper (Capsicum annum L.) was investigated in greenhouse pot experiments under controlled conditions. Pepper plants were cultivated in substrate amended by aqueous solutions of arsenite, arsenate, methylarsonic acid (MA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) applied individually into cultivation substrate at concentrations of 15 mg As per kg of substrate. The plant availability of the arsenicals increased in the order arsenite = arsenate < MA < DMA. The highest arsenic concentrations were found in roots followed by stems, leaves, and fruits regardless of arsenic compound applied. In the control samples of pepper fruits, As(III), As(V), and DMA were present (25%, 37%, and 39% of the water-extractable arsenic). In control stems + leaves and roots, As(V) was the major compound (63% and 53% in a phosphate buffer extract) followed by As(III) representing 33% and 42%. Additionally, low concentrations (not exceeding 5%) of DMA and MA were detected as well. In all the soils analyzed after the first harvest of pepper fruits, arsenate was the dominating compound followed by arsenite. Methylarsonic acid, methylarsonous acid, and DMA were present at varying concentrations depending on the individual soil treatments. In the treated plants, the arsenic compounds in plant tissues reflected predominantly the extractable portions of arsenic compounds present in soil after amendment, and this pattern was more significant in the first part of vegetation period. The results confirmed the ability of generative parts of plants to accumulate preferably organic arsenic compounds, whereas in the roots and aboveground biomass, mainly inorganic arsenic species are present. Evidently, the source of soil arsenic contamination affects significantly the extractable portions of arsenic compounds in soil and subsequently the distribution of arsenic compounds within the plants.",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D001149', 'D001151', 'D001152', 'D018053', 'D002101', 'D002212', 'D002851', 'D018514', 'D012989', 'D021241']","['Arsenates', 'Arsenic', 'Arsenicals', 'Arsenites', 'Cacodylic Acid', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Plant Structures', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Response of pepper plants (Capsicum annum L.) on soil amendment by inorganic and organic compounds of arsenic.,"['Q000493', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000493', 'Q000493', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000032', None]","['pharmacokinetics', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'pharmacokinetics', 'pharmacokinetics', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17031752,2007

16989312,"Acetone extracts from eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) and violet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) peels both belonging to the Solanaceae plant family were characterized with respect to their anthocyanin profiles, colour qualities and antioxidant capacities. According to HPLC-DAD-MS3 analyses the major anthocyanin in eggplant was delphinidin-3-rutinoside, while the predominant pigment in violet pepper was assigned to delphinidin-3-trans-coumaroylrutinoside-5-glucoside. Since virtually all anthocyanins were delphinidin-based, the effect of acylation and glycosylation patterns on colour stability and antioxidant capacity could be assessed. Application of two in vitro-assays for antioxidant capacity assessment revealed that eggplant generally exhibited higher values compared to violet pepper which was ascribed to 3,5-diglycosylated structures predominating in the latter. The higher extent of acylation in violet pepper was reflected by a more purplish colour shade of the extracts, but did not translate into a higher stability against fading which again was attributed to additional glycosyl substitution at C5. These findings support the relevance of structure-related activities of anthocyanins both for understanding food colour and their particular nutritional value.","Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

16923603,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) pepper (Capsicum spp.) germplasm collection contains several thousand members or accessions. Many of these species and cultivars have not been analyzed for their concentrations of ascorbic acid, capsaicin, and total phenolic compounds, which are important antioxidants having a number of benefits for human health. The objective of this investigation was to select candidate accessions of hot pepper having high concentrations of ascorbic acid, capsaicin, free sugars, and total phenols for use as parents in breeding for these compounds. Seventeen accessions of pepper from the core Capsicum germplasm collection (four accessions of Capsicum chinense; five accessions of C. baccatum; six accessions of C. annuum; and two of C. frutescens) were field grown and their mature fruits were analyzed for their antioxidant composition. Concentrations of these compounds tended to be higher in C. chinense and C. baccatum, than in C. annuum and C. frutescens. Across all accessions the concentration of total phenols was correlated with ascorbic acid (r = 0.97) and free sugars (r = 0.80). Concentrations of total phenols (1.4, 1.3, and 1.3 mg g-1 fruit) and ascorbic acid (1.6, 1.2, and 1.3 mg g-1 fruit) were significantly greater in PI-633757, PI-387833, and PI-633754, respectively, compared to other accessions analyzed. Total capsaicinoids concentrations were greatest (1.3 mg g-1 fruit) in PI-438622 and lowest (0.002 mg g-1 fruit) in Grif-9320.

To further improve the usefulness of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), studies were carried out on the analysis of extracts containing up to eight of the following capsaicinoids: capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin-I, homocapsaicin-II, homodihydrocapsaicin-I, homodihydrocapsaicin-II, nonivamide, and nordihydrocapsaicin. HPLC was optimized by defining effects on retention times of (a) the composition of the mobile phase (acetonitrile/0.5% formic acid in H2O), (b) the length of the Inertsil column, and (c) the capacity values (k) of the column packing. Identification was based on retention times and mass spectra of individual peaks. Quantification was based on the UV response at 280 nm in HPLC and recoveries from spiked samples. The method (limit of detection of approximately 15-30 ng) was successfully used to quantify capsaicinoid levels of parts of the pepper fruit (pericarp, placenta, seeds, and in the top, middle, and base parts of whole peppers) in 17 species of peppers and in 23 pepper-containing foods.

Marigold flower, a good rotation crop for the control of nematodes in tobacco fields was found to contain 0.77% lutein (after saponification, on dry basis). A high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method using a two-phase solvent system consisting of hexane-ethanol-water (6:4.5:1.5, v/v/v) was developed for the purification of lutein from the saponification mixture of marigold flower extract. The purity of lutein prepared using this HSCCC method was 97%. Free lutein was found to be the predominant form in three squash varieties, and it was mostly found in the peel rather than the commonly consumed flesh. Sweet Mamma, Buttercup and Pepper squash varieties contained 25.4, 18.4 and 30.1mg/100g fresh weigh (FW) of lutein in the peels, respectively. These concentrations were significantly higher than that in spinach and kale (3.7 and 12.3 mg/100 g FW). beta-Carotene was found most in the peel of Sweet Mamma squash at 13.6 mg/100g FW, whereas it was below 2mg/100g FW in all other samples. Cooking increased extractable free lutein by 22-65% in squash peels. Lutein in Yukon Gold potato was at ca. 0.4 mg/100 g FW. Certain Yukon Gold was also found to contain violaxanthin (0.35 mg/100 g FW). Structures of lutein, beta-carotene and violaxanthin were identified by LC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization MS in positive ion mode, and by comparing the retention time and UV-vis spectral data with standards.

Xyloglucans, solubilized from plant cell walls by a sequential (enzymatic and chemical) extraction procedure, were isolated, and their structures were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. All campanulids examined, including Lactuca sativa (lettuce, order Asterales), Tenacetum ptarmiciflorum (dusty miller, order Asterales), and Daucus carota (carrot, order Apiales), produce typical xyloglucans that have an XXXG-type branching pattern and contain alpha-d-Xylp-, beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Xylp-, and alpha-L-Fucp-(1-->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Xylp- side chains. However, the lamiids produce atypical xyloglucans. For example, previous analyses showed that Capsicum annum (pepper) and Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato), two species in the order Solanales, and Olea europaea (olive, order Lamiales) produce xyloglucans that contain arabinosyl and galactosyl residues, but lack fucosyl residues. The XXGG-type xyloglucans produced by Solanaceous species are less branched than the XXXG-type xyloglucan produced by Olea europaea. This study shows that Ipomoea pupurea (morning glory, order Solanales), Ocimum basilicum (basil, order Lamiales), and Plantago major (plantain, order Lamiales) all produce xyloglucans that lack fucosyl residues and have an unusual XXGGG-type branching pattern in which the basic repeating core contains five glucose subunits in the backbone. Furthermore, Neruim oleander (order Gentianales) produces an XXXG-type xyloglucan that contains arabinosyl, galactosyl, and fucosyl residues. The appearance of this intermediate xyloglucan structure in oleander has implications regarding the evolutionary development of xyloglucan structure and its role in primary plant cell walls.",Carbohydrate research,"['D000438', 'D019659', 'D002212', 'D002236', 'D002473', 'D002851', 'D018552', 'D005936', 'D007477', 'D018545', 'D018551', 'D009682', 'D013058', 'D009844', 'D010802', 'D013045', 'D019032', 'D014990']","['Alcohols', 'Asteraceae', 'Capsicum', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cell Wall', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Daucus carota', 'Glucans', 'Ions', 'Lettuce', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Phylogeny', 'Species Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Xylans']",Structural analysis of xyloglucans in the primary cell walls of plants in the subclass Asteridae.,"['Q000737', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15975566,2005

15721202,"Profenofos (Selecron 72% EC), was sprayed on field-grown pepper and eggplant at the recommended rate of 1.28 kg a,i/ha. Fruit samples were collected at 1 h to 14 days after application and analysed to determine the content and dissipation rate of profenofos. The effect of different washing solutions and some household processing on the removal of such residues from treated vegetables were also investigated. Profenofos residues were quantified by using gas chromatography. The results showed that the consumable safety time were found to be 10 days on sweet pepper and 14 days on hot pepper and eggplant fruits. The initial disappearance of profenofos appeared to follow first order kinetics with different rates of reaction of 0.38, 0.40 and 0.35 day(-1) for hot pepper, sweet pepper and eggplant, respectively. The corresponding half-lives (t1/2) were 1.84, 1.74 and 1.96 days. Also, the results indicated that tap water, potassium permenganate and acetic acid solution gave high percent removal of profenofos residues from hot and sweet pepper fruits, while no detectable residues was found in eggplant fruit after washing with soap and acetic acid solutions. In general, all tested washing solutions gave higher percent removal of profenofos residues from eggplant fruit than the two other pepper fruits. Blanching and frying of pepper and eggplant fruits resulted in great reduction to almost completely removed (approximately 100%) of the deposited profenofos.

The formulation was sprayed on pepper and tomato foliage when tomato fruits became red ripe and pepper became mature green at the rate of 6 lbs of formulated product per acre (5.4 and 27.2 g AI of pyrethrins and PBO, respectively). Following spraying, pepper and tomato leaves and fruits were collected at different time intervals for residue analysis using a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a UV detector. Residues of pyrethrins and PBO were generally higher on the leaves than fruits. Initial deposits (1 h following spraying) of pyrethrins were significantly higher on pepper than tomato fruits.

Metal ions were concentrated as their amalgams on a glassy carbon-working electrode previously coated with a thin mercury film and then stripped by a suitable oxidant. Potential and time data were digitally derived and E was plotted versus dt/dE(-1), thus increasing both the sensitivity of the method and the resolution of the analysis. Quantitative analysis was carried out by the method of standard addition; good linearity was obtained in the range of examined concentrations, as was shown by the determination coefficients, which were 0.998 (n = 4) for cadmium and 0.993 (n = 4) for lead. Recoveries of 85-100% for cadmium and of 84-97% for lead were obtained from a sample spiked at different levels. Accuracy was demonstrated by analysis of a matching reference sample of cabbage. The detection limits were 1.8 ng g(-1) of wet mass for cadmium and 5.1 ng g(-1) of wet mass for lead.

Five hydroxycinnamic derivatives and 23 flavonoids were characterized and quantified from the pericarp of sweet pepper by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification was carried out by their UV spectra, chromatographic comparisons with authentic markers, identification of hydrolysis products, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Hydroxycinnamic derivatives, O-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol, and a large number of C-glycosyl flavones have been characterized. Some of these compounds were found for the first time in nature. Clear differences in the individual and total phenolic content were detected between the different maturity stages. Immature green pepper had a very high phenolic content while green, immature red, and red ripe peppers showed a 4-5-fold reduction. Ascorbic acid was the main form of vitamin C, and its content increased as the pepper reached maturity. The red ripe stage had a relevant impact on the carotenoids content.

The transgenic rice plants require foliar application of amines to support synthesis of hydroxycinnamic acid amides, suggestive of limiting amine substrates in rice shoots. In addition, when T2 homozygous transgenic rice plants were grown in the presence of amines or phenolic acids, two novel compounds were exclusively identified in the leaves of the transgenic plants. These compounds eluted earlier than p-coumaroyltyramine and feruloyltyramine during HPLC chromatography and were identified as p-coumaroylserotonin and feruloylserotonin by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and other methods. To test whether the unpredicted production of serotonin derivatives is associated with the pepper N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase, the substrate specificity of the pepper enzyme was analyzed again. Purified recombinant pepper N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase exhibited a serotonin N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (SHT) activity, synthesized p-coumaroylserotonin and feruloylserotonin in vitro, and demonstrated a low K(m) for serotonin. SHT activity was inhibited by 10 to 50 mm tyramine. In addition, SHT activity was predominantly found in the root tissues of wild-type rice in parallel with the synthesis of serotonin derivatives, suggesting that serotonin derivatives are synthesized in the root of rice.

12888387,"A scientific basis for the evaluation of the risk to public health arising from excessive dietary intake of nitrate in Korea is provided. The nitrate () and nitrite () contents of various vegetables (Chinese cabbage, radish, lettuce, spinach, soybean sprouts, onion, pumpkin, green onion, cucumber, potato, carrot, garlic, green pepper, cabbage and Allium tuberosum Roth known as Crown daisy) are reported. Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables. The average nitrite contents in various vegetables were about 0.6 mg kg(-1), and the values were not significantly different among most vegetables. It was observed that nitrate contents in vegetables varied depending on the type of vegetables and were similar to those in vegetables grown in other countries. From the results of our studies and other information from foreign sources, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to establish limits of nitrates contents of vegetables cultivated in Korea due to the co-presence of beneficial elements such as ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol which are known to inhibit the formation of nitrosamine.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000490', 'D001530', 'D001937', 'D002212', 'D002852', 'D004032', 'D006801', 'D007391', 'D007723', 'D009566', 'D009573', 'D019697', 'D031224', 'D012621', 'D013025', 'D013056', 'D006113', 'D014675']","['Allium', 'Belgium', 'Brassica', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Diet', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Korea', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrites', 'Onions', 'Raphanus', 'Seasons', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'United Kingdom', 'Vegetables']",Survey of nitrate and nitrite contents of vegetables grown in Korea.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'adverse effects', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12888387,2003

The objective of the present study was to assess the availability of carotenoids from paprika oleoresin, including zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, beta-carotene and the paprika-specific oxocarotenoids capsanthin and capsorubin. After overnight fasting, the volunteers (n 9) ingested a single dose of the paprika oleoresin containing 6.4 mg zeaxanthin, 4.2 mg beta-cryptoxanthin, 6.2 mg beta-carotene, 35.0 mg capsanthin and 2.0 mg capsorubin. At different time points the carotenoid pattern in the chylomicron fraction was analysed to evaluate carotenoid absorption. From the major carotenoids present in the paprika oleoresin only zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene were detectable in considerable amounts.

Though a number of methods for analysis of this omnipresent food component in pepper fruits are available, its analysis in body fluids has been largely neglected. A high-performance liquid chromatography method for the analysis of piperine in rat plasma is presented in this communication. Analysis was performed using a Symmetry C(18) column (250x4.6 mm) by isocratic elution with 25 mM KH(2)PO(4) (pH 4.5)-acetonitrile (35:65) and UV detection at 340 nm. The calibration plot was linear over the range studied (2-2000 ng) with correlation coefficient of 0.9984. Limit of detection and limit of quantitation were 1 ng/ml and 3 ng/ml, respectively. Good overall recovery (85.5+/-6%) was obtained with 4 ml ethyl acetate and extraction time of 3 min. Intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation was found to be less than 7.5%.

11351092,"Seven small (approximately 6,000 D) wound-inducible proteinase inhibitor proteins were isolated from leaves of pepper (Capsicum annuum) plants that are members of the potato inhibitor II family. N-terminal sequences obtained indicated that the pepper leaf proteinase inhibitors (PLPIs) exhibit homology to two GenBank accessions that code for preproteins containing three isoinhibitors domains each that, when post-translationally processed, can account for the mixture of isoinhibitors that are reported herein from pepper leaves. A constitutive level of PLPI proteins was found in pepper leaves, and these levels increased up to 2.6-fold upon wounding of the lower leaves. Exposing intact plants to methyl jasmonate vapors induced the accumulation of PLPIs. Supplying excised young pepper plants with water through the cut stems induced PLPI proteins to levels higher than those found in intact plants, but with high variability. Supplying the excised plants with systemin did not result in an increase of PLPI levels that were statistically higher than levels found in excised plants. Gel-blot analyses of PLPI induction revealed the presence of two mRNA bands, having slightly different mobilities in agarose gels. Only the low M(r) mRNA is present in untreated control plants, and it appears to be responsible for the constitutive levels of PLPI found in leaves.

Various classes of compounds of different origin were detected in food and beverages. In particular nitrosamines and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons attracted attention, due to their mutagenic and cancerogenic potential (1, 2). Traces of PAHs have been detected in many foods, including vegetables, vegetable oils, fruits, grains, sea food, grilled and roasted meat, smoked fish, coffee and tea. PAHs in food are only a part of the general problem of PAH pollution in the environment. The numerous types of PAHs--some 100 have been isolated and identified in food and in the environment--are a challenge to modern analytical technique. Various chromatographic procedures, including column, paper and thin layer chromatography have been applied to isolate these substances from contaminated samples. Some of these methods give satisfactory results, especially in the determination of single PAHs including benzo(a)pyrene (3). Gas chromatography and HPLC are the techniques most widely used to meet these analytical demands. Very important are pretreatment of food samples and clean-up procedures. In Slovakia limits for B)a)P in food are: 0.001 mg/kg in smoked meat and fish products; 0.003 mg/kg in paprika, pepper, sausages. Other PAHs (from US EPA 16 PAH) have no limits. This paper describes determination of benzo(a)pyrene in different food samples by gel permeation chromatography and the HPLC method with a fluorescence detector. State Veterinary Institute (SVU) in Dolný Kubín (Slovakia) is authorized for determination of benzo(a)pyrene in all samples, which are imported to Slovakia. Many samples with excessive of benzo(a)pyrene were from Baltic Sea (especially smoked sprats).",Central European journal of public health,"['D001564', 'D002850', 'D002851', 'D005504', 'D013050']","['Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",Application of gel permeation chromatography and HPLC method with fluorescence detector to determination of benzo(a)pyrene in food samples.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'methods', 'methods', 'methods', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10943489,2000
10888567,"Spice paprika (red pepper; Capsicum annuum) is the most cultivated spice worldwide and is used mainly for its color and pungency. However, current research is also focusing on the flavor as an important parameter. This paper deals with the kinetics of the formation of those volatiles that indicate a decrease in spice paprika quality due to Maillard reaction, hydrolytic reactions, and oxidative degradation reactions of lipids such as fatty acids and carotenoids. Spice paprika volatiles were quantitatively analyzed by means of headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The kinetics of their formation were investigated, and the respective activation energies determined. Strecker aldehyde, acetone, and methanol formation followed a pseudo-zero-order reaction kinetic, and formation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) was characterized by a first-order kinetic. The activation energies determined were between 86.3 and 101.8 for the Strecker aldehydes acetaldehyde (AA), 2-methylpropanal (2-MP), 3-methylbutanal (3-MB), and 2-methylbutanal (2-MB), 130.7 for acetone, 114.2 for methanol, and 109.7 kJ/mol for DMS. The amounts of Strecker aldehydes formed were correlated to the concentrations of the corresponding free amino acids present in the samples. The formation of hexanal and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one in Capsicum annuum during processing was confirmed, and the formation of beta-ionone was probably described for the first time. During heating, the concentration of hexanal increased rapidly. The formation of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one confirms that Capsicum annuum fruits contain lycopene.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002212', 'D003296', 'D008401', 'D006358', 'D010946', 'D017365', 'D013440']","['Capsicum', 'Cooking', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hot Temperature', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Spices', 'Sulfides']",Formation of volatile compounds during heating of spice paprika (Capsicum annuum) powder.,"[None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10888567,2000

10563856,"A study was conducted to investigate the change in quality attributes of red pepper (paprika) (Capsicum annuum L. var. Km-622) as a function of ripening and some technological factors. Of quality attributes, carotenoids and bioantioxidants (ascorbic acid and tocopherols) have been studied. It was found that the dynamics of fruit ripening with regard to carotenoids and bioantioxidants was influenced to a considerable extent by weather conditions of the production season. A rainy and cool season yielded fruits with more beta-carotene but less diesters of red xanthophylls as compared to those produced in a relatively dry and warm season. The ripening stage at harvest was found to affect the quality of paprika. Harvest at unripe stages (color break or faint red) resulted in a high accumulation of dehydroascorbic acid in the overripe fruits, whereas de novo biosynthesis of carotenoids and tocopherols was partially retarded. Application of pre-drying centrifugation resulted in a marked loss of ascorbic acid, and as a consequence, carotenoid stability was impaired during the storage of ground paprika. Sugar caramelization caused dry pods and ground paprika to retain more pigments and tocopherol as compared to those from control or centrifuged red pepper samples.

10520965,"Irritating dietary substances such as tannin and papain have been reported to alter the morphology of salivary glands and their secretions. Such alterations can be one line of protection from toxic or irritating substances in food. We investigated the effects of dietary capsaicin (a pungent ingredient of hot red pepper) on the rat submandibular gland and its secretions. Several groups of animals were offered either control diets or diets containing capsaicin (from 0.0001 to 0.1%) for seven days. Higher concentrations suppressed food consumption for two days, after which only the highest concentration continued to reduce intake. The relative weight of the salivary glands in capsaicin-diet groups increased in a dose-dependent fashion, and new proteins appeared in the submandibular saliva. Chromatographic and electrophoretic properties of these proteins were identical or similar to those of isoproterenol-induced proteins. After affinity chromatography of the new protein fraction on a Cm-papain Sepharose 4B column, SDS-electrophoresis of the eluate revealed three major bands (15,500, 16,500, and 28,000 kDa). Hydrolysis of N-benzoyl-D,L-arginine-p-nitroanilide by papain (a cysteine protease) decreased in the presence of the new protein fraction, suggesting that these proteins have cystatin-like activity (inhibition of cysteine protease). Denervation of the glossopharyngeal nerve suppressed induction of these proteins. The results suggest that dietary capsaicin induces cystatin S-like substances in submandibular saliva by stimulating the reflex arc involving the glossopharyngeal nerve.

9804838,"The differentiation of chloroplasts into chromoplasts involves a series of biochemical changes that culminate with the intense accumulation of long chain chromophore carotenoids such as lycopene, rhodoxanthin, astaxanthin, anhydroeschsoltzxanthin, capsanthin, and capsorubin. The signal pathways mediating these transformations are unknown. Chromoplast carotenoids are known to accumulate in green tissues experiencing stress conditions, and studies indicate that they provide efficient protection against oxidative stress. We tested the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as regulators of chromoplast carotenoid biosynthesis in vivo. The addition of ROS progenitors, such as menadione, tert-butylhydroperoxide, or paraquat and prooxidants such as diamide or buthionine sulfoximine to green pericarp discs of pepper fruits rapidly and dramatically induce the simultaneous expression of multiple carotenogenic gene mRNAS that give rise to capsanthin. Similarly, down-regulation of catalase by amitrole induces expression of carotenogenic gene mRNAs leading to the synthesis of capsanthin in excised green pericarp discs. ROS signals from plastids and mitochondria also contribute significantly to this process. Analysis of the capsanthin-capsorubin synthase promoter in combination with a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene reveals strong activation in transformed pepper protoplasts challenged with the above ROS.

Using Ames-test with Salmonella TA 98 and TA 100 proved high cytotoxic effects due to pure safrole and black pepper volatile oil in both of them. The degradation of safrole was obvious after drying of the washed seeds of black pepper especially at 70 degrees C for 30 min or with sun-drying. Also, high irradiation doses (20 and 30 kGy) caused high degradation of more than 90% of the initial toxic concentration in black pepper. Whereas, microwave caused same effects at 75 s, but unfortunately, the powder was burned due to moisture absence. Boiling whole seeds or powder of black pepper during cooking for few minutes (1-5 min) were more efficient in decreasing safrole content. Finally, these results proved that the mutagenicity of some spices due to presence of safrole can be destructed during drying of the washed seeds or during cooking either with or without any additional treatment as irradiation.

24198108,"The influence of naturally occurring uraniferous black shales on cadmium, molybdenum and selenium concentrations in soils and plants is examined. The possible implications of element concentrations to animal and human health are considered for the Deog-Pyoung area.Geochemical surveys have been undertaken within 13 river tributary valleys in the area underlain by uraniferous black shales and black slates or grey chlorite schists. Sampling of rocks, soils and plants has been carried out along transect lines within each valley. Samples were analysed for trace elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) and for uranium by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA). Soil pH, cation exchange capacity, loss on ignition and particle size distribution have been measured for selected samples.Average trace element concentrations of the Okchon uraniferous black shales were 6.3 μg g(-1) Cd, 136 μg g(-1) Mo and 8.6 μg g(-1) Se. Soils derived from these rocks tend to reflect their extreme geochemical composition. Trace element concentrations in alluvial soils derived in part from these black shales averaged 1.2 μg g(-1) Cd, 20 μg g(-1) Mo and 1.5 μg g(-1) Se. Trace element concentrations in plants were found to be influenced by those of soils. Cadmium accumulated in tobacco leaves up to 46 μg g(-1) (D.M.) and leafy plants such as lettuce contain up to 0.5 μg g(-1) Se (D.M.).In addition to total concentrations in soils, soil pH is a major factor influencing uptake of Mo into crop plants and soil texture for Se. Concentrations of trace elements in plants also varied between plant species. The relative concentrations of Cd were found to vary in the order tobacco > lettuce > red pepper > rice grain.Elevated concentrations of Cd in crop plants and in tobacco may possibly have deleterious effects on human health in this area. The low Cu:Mo ratio in rice stalk of 2.65:1 may be associated with disturbed Cu metabolism in ruminant animals which regularly consume this material.

1381358,"Cysteine synthase (O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase) has been purified to homogeneity from bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) fruit chromoplasts. This enzyme consists of two subunits of 35 kDa. Immunocytochemical localization experiments confirmed the plastid location of this enzyme. A full-length cDNA was isolated from an expression library of C. annuum. The deduced peptide sequence revealed high similarity between the C. annuum cysteine synthase and its bacterial counterparts. In vitro transcription and translation of the cDNA and subsequent import experiments demonstrated that the encoded cysteine synthase is located in the plastids. The steady-state level of the cysteine synthase mRNA is almost constant in dark-grown hypocotyls, leaves, and fruits. However, a slight increase in this mRNA level was detected during fruit development (when the 25 S rRNA was taken as an internal standard). Similarly, the cysteine synthase activity in plastids was found to increase during fruit development and reaches the highest levels in the chromoplasts of red fruits. To address the physiological role of this phenomenon, we have shown that cysteine is engaged in the active metabolism of glutathione. Thus, in connection with the previous demonstration of an active tocopherol metabolism, it is concluded that differentiation of chloroplast to chromoplast in C. annuum involves an active synthesis of potential antioxidants or redox modulators.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D000595', 'D002212', 'D002736', 'D002845', 'D002846', 'D002850', 'D002852', 'D003001', 'D003547', 'D004247', 'D017886', 'D006882', 'D008969', 'D008970', 'D010946', 'D012313', 'D012333', 'D011994', 'D012689', 'D014158']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Capsicum', 'Chloroplasts', 'Chromatography', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine Synthase', 'DNA', 'Durapatite', 'Hydroxyapatites', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'RNA', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",Cysteine synthase from Capsicum annuum chromoplasts.

24240962,"A radioimmunoassay for (+)-abscisic acid (ABA) was developed and applied to the analysis of free ABA in extracts of apple (Malus pumila Mill.) and sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) leaves at various stages during extract purification. Conjugates of ABA, were quantified after alkaline hydrolysis. The validity of the radioimmunoassay was tested by comparison of immunoassay estimates of ABA at different levels of extract purity with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antiserum, raised against (+)-ABA, was almost equally sensitive to (-)-ABA. Serum cross-reactivity with the methyl ester of ABA was 160% and with the glycosyl ester of ABA was 34%. Cross-reactivity with protein-ABA conjugates was very slight for C'4-conjugated keyholelimpet haemocyanin, but about 1000% for C1-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Other compounds tested showed extremely low or undetectable cross-reactivities. Further evidence for the specificity of the assay came from the agreement between the results using different assay methods for both apple and pepper extracts, and from the observation that the only zone of immunoreactivity on HPLC elution profiles corresponded with authentic (+)-ABA. The use of polyvinylpyrrolidone in the assay minimised interference by other substances in plant extracts. In pepper, free ABA levels increased rapidly during water stress and recovered to pre-stress levels within two days after rewatering. Levels of ABA conjugates were significantly lowr than free ABA in unstressed plants, and also increased rapidly with stress, although not to the same extent as free ABA, and did not recover as rapidly as did free ABA. In apple, levels of free ABA and of ABA conjugates both increased more than twofold over a two-week period of water stress. In contrast to pepper, however, immunoreactivity of the conjugate fraction was increased by hydrolysis, indicating that different ABA conjugates predominate in the two species.

6885685,"A method was developed for simultaneously determining 6 synthetic pyrethroid insecticides (fenpropanate, tetramethrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate, and deltamethrin) in apple, orange, grape, lemon, tomato, green pepper, and paprika, and sugar beet root and leaves. The pesticides were extracted with acetone and partitioned into methylene chloride. The extract was purified by column chromatography on active carbon-magnesia-diatomaceous earth and then on alumina. Analysis by gas-liquid chromatography with 63Ni electron capture detection was completed in 6 min on a 3% SE-30 liquid phase, using a short column.
