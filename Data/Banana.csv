34679656,"Bananas are an essential source of staple food and fruit worldwide and are widely regarded as the world's largest fruit crop, with more than 100 million tons total annual production. Banana peel, a by-product that represents about 40% of the entire banana's weight, and pulp are rich in bioactive compounds and have a high antioxidant capacity. As the production of polyphenols in fruit and vegetables is highly dependent on environmental conditions, genetic factors, and the level of maturity, this study aims to characterize six Australian banana cultivars in various stages of ripening for their phenolic compounds using the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS), polyphenols quantification with the high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA), and their antioxidant capacity. All bananas were analysed for total polyphenols content (TPC), total flavonoids content (TFC), and total tannin content (TTC) and their antioxidant activities. Ripe Ducasse peel and pulp contained the highest amounts of total polyphenols content (1.32 and 1.28 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of sample), total tannin contents (3.34 mg catechin equivalent (CE) per gram of sample), and free radical scavenging capacity (106.67 mg ascorbic acid equivalent (AAE) per g of sample). In contrast, ripe Plantain peel had the greatest total flavonoids (0.03 mg quercetin equivalent (QE) per g of sample). On the other hand, unripe Ladyfinger pulp possessed the highest total antioxidant activity (1.03 mg AAE/g of sample). There was a positive correlation between flavonoids and antioxidant activities. By using LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS, a total of 24 phenolic compounds were tentatively characterized in this research, including six phenolic acids, 13 flavonoids, and five other polyphenols. Quantification of phenolic compounds by the high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA) revealed a higher content of phenolic acids. These findings confirmed that banana peel and pulp have considerable antioxidant activity and can be employed in human food and animal feed for variant health enhancement uses.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Screening and Characterization of Phenolic Compounds from Australian Grown Bananas and Their Antioxidant Capacity.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34679656,2021
34497319,"Scientific investigations on levels of Organochlorine Pesticide (OCP) residues in plants largely consider the edible parts (crops, vegetables, and fruit plants). Though the non-edible parts of plants are not eaten by human beings directly, these parts are consumed by livestock and other animals, thereby facilitating the flow of chemical residues through the food chain. The objective of the present investigation was to evaluate the concentration of OCP residues in non-edible plant parts to provide insights on their potential ecotoxicological impacts. Eighteen OCP residues were extracted in nine different plant species (banana Musa acuminate, brinjal Solanum melongena, Casuarina equisetifolia, Eucalyptus globulus, lotus Nelumbo nucifera, paddy Oryza sativa, sugarcane Saccharum officinarum, tapioca Manihot esculenta, tomato Lycopersicon esculentum) following QuEChERS method. The concentrations of OCP residues in plant extracts were determined using Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The OCP residues, namely: γ-HCH (lindane), heptachlor epoxide isomer, dieldrin, endrin, endrin aldehyde and endrin ketone were found predominantly in seven plant species. Residues of γ-HCH (lindane) were reported in different parts of plant species such as stem (581.14 ng/g in paddy and 585.82 ng/g in tapioca) and leaf (583.3 ng/g in tomato). Seven samples contained residues of heptachlor epoxide isomer (512.53 to 1173.8 ng/g). Dieldrin was found in paddy stem (489.97 ng/g), tapioca stem (490.21 ng/g) and tapioca leaf (490.32 ng/g). The detected OCPs in the present study were 10-50 times higher than the Maximum Residue Limits (MRL, 0.01-0.1 mg/Kg) as prescribed in the Codex Alimentarius of the FAO/WHO. Their elevated concentrations in the plant parts therefore pose risk of contamination to the consumers in the food chain, including human beings those are dependent on the animals as source of protein. The findings of this study are the first report on residue levels of OCPs in non-edible plant parts in the agricultural landscape of Puducherry region, India. Since, this study assumes significance for the strategic location of Oussudu Lake, an interstate lake spread over Puducherry and Tamil Nadu states, regular monitoring of OCP residues in different environmental segments in strategic locations in both the states is suggested, which will help the authorities in devising a comprehensive environmental management plan aiming at the ecosystem at large.",Scientific reports,"['D000383', 'D017753', 'D054750', 'D004784', 'D005506', 'D006843', 'D010573', 'D010944']","['Agriculture', 'Ecosystem', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Food Contamination', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plants']",Organochlorine pesticide residues in plants and their possible ecotoxicological and agri food impacts.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497319,2021

Eighty-seven banana samples were purchased from various supermarkets around the country. The conventional QuEChERS method was used to extract 294 pesticides in whole bananas and the analysis was carried out using LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. In total, nine pesticides were detected of which azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, imazalil, and thiabendazole were the most frequently found in bananas from both countries. The levels of these pesticides were complaint according to the Saudi Food & Drug Authority's (SFDA) maximum residue levels (MRLs), therefore they cannot be considered a public health problem. Detectable residues of these agrochemicals show that they are used extensively in banana cultivation. The Ecuadorian Agency for Agricultural Quality Assurance (Agrocalidad) and the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture (MEWA) prohibit the use of carbendazim in agriculture, while the Filipino Fertiliser and Pesticide Authority (FPA) allows its use.

Using direct membrane inlet single-photon ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MI-SPI-ToF-MS), 18 VOCs belonging to 10 functional groups were detected in the air samples, and their VOC emission profiles were established using cluster analysis on time-resolved data. Three emission stages were clearly identified, with the major release for most VOC compounds occurring during the first 14 d. The emission patterns of the individual compounds were quite similar despite the different release mechanisms. In addition, no apparent increase in temperature was observed inside the simulator during the entire experimental period.

Here, we couple a portable leaf photosynthesis system to an autosampler for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to enable field observations of net photosynthesis simultaneously with emissions of VOCs as a function of light. Following sample collection, VOCs are analyzed using automated thermal desorption-gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). An example is presented from a banana plant in the central Amazon with a focus on the response of photosynthesis and the emissions of eight individual monoterpenes to light intensity. Our observations reveal that banana leaf emissions represent a 1.1 +/- 0.1% loss of photosynthesis by carbon. Monoterpene emissions from banana are dominated by trans-β-ocimene, which accounts for up to 57% of total monoterpene emissions at high light. We conclude that the developed system is ideal for the identification and quantification of VOC emissions from leaves in parallel with CO2 and water fluxes.The system therefore permits the analysis of biological and environmental sensitivities of carbon metabolism in leaves in remote field locations, resulting in the emission of hydrocarbons to the atmosphere.•A field-portable system is developed for the identification and quantification of VOCs from leaves in parallel with leaf physiological measurements including photosynthesis and transpiration.•The system will enable the characterization of carbon and energy allocation to the biosynthesis and emission of VOCs linked with photosynthesis (e.g. isoprene and monoterpenes) and their biological and environmental sensitivities (e.g. light, temperature, CO",MethodsX,[],[],Development of a portable leaf photosynthesis and volatile organic compounds emission system.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322545,2020

Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic acid hydroxy stearic acid (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi).

We analyzed the sequences, transcript levels, and functions of genes involved in carotenoid synthesis. The high ratio of α-/β-carotene in ripe banana fruit was explained by the high flux to the α-carotene biosynthetic pathway, as reflected by high transcript levels of LCYE, and the weak flux to the β-carotene branch of the biosynthetic pathway due to inactive MaLCYB1.2.

Tyrosine, a physiological substrate of polyphenol oxidase, has an analogous structure to acetaminophen. We investigated whether banana extract causes structural changes in acetaminophen and a decrease in its potency. Acetaminophen concentration in banana extract was measured under different conditions to characterize incompatibility. Reaction products in solution were identified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS). Acetaminophen potency decreased with time in the presence of banana extract. The reaction proceeded most efficiently in temperatures 30-37°C and neutral to weakly acidic conditions. Molecular ion peaks derived from the oxidized catechol moiety of acetaminophen were identified in LC/ESI/MS spectra. Our findings suggest that incorporation or simultaneous administration of acetaminophen medication and banana juice may result in decreased efficacy of the clinically important drug. This interaction is likely due to the oxidation of acetaminophen by polyphenol oxidase activity in banana pulp.

The plant is harvested and large amounts of biomass residues are originated, mainly from the pseudo stem (i.e., fiber bundles obtained from the leaf sheaths after being scrapped to produce starchy food) and the inflorescence stalk. These materials were studied in relation to their summative chemical composition, composition of lignin, lipophilic and polar extracts. Moreover, their structural characteristics, in view of their valorization, were scrutinized. The analytical studies were performed with the aid of FTIR, GC/MS, Py-GC/MS and SEM. The fiber bundles are aggregates of mainly long and slender fibers with low ash, extractives and lignin contents (3.8%. 4.4% and 10.5% respectively) and high holocellulose and α-cellulose contents (87.5% and 59.6% respectively). The hemicelluloses in the fibers are mostly highly acetylated xylans and the lignin is of the H-type (H:G:S, 1:0.7:0.8). This lignin composition is in line with the FTIR peaks at 1670 cm-1 and 1250 cm-1.The inflorescence stalk has high ash content (12.3% in the main stalk and 24.6% in fines) with a major proportion of potassium, high extractives (25.9%), and low lignin and α-cellulose contents (5.8% and 17.9% respectively). The stalk includes numerous starch granules in the cellular structure with the predominant presence of parenchyma. The potential valorization routes for these materials are clearly different.

This study assayed the essential macro and trace minerals as well as phenolic compounds present in unripe banana flour (UBF) obtained from the pulp of four different cultivars. Unripe banana flour was processed by oven drying in a forced air oven dryer at 70°C upon pretreatment with ascorbic, citric and lactic acid. Organic acid pretreatment was done separately on each unripe banana cultivar at concentrations of 10, 15 and 20g/L. Phenolic compounds were profiled using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry electrospray ion (LC-MS-ESI) while essential minerals were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) respectively. Results of LC-MS-ESI assay of phenolics revealed the presence of flavonoids: epicatechin and myricetin 3-O-rhamnosyl-glucoside in varying concentrations in UBF. Essential mineral profile indicated that Zinc had the least occurrence of 3.55mg/kg (p<0.05), while potassium was the most abundant mineral at 14746.73mg/kg in UBF of all four banana cultivars. Correlation between phenolic compounds and essential minerals using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient test revealed weak and inverse association between flavonoids and most macro and trace minerals present in UBF samples.

The flavor properties were established by sensory profiling and analysis of volatile and non-volatile components, including titratable acidity, pH, residual sugars and organic acids. A total of 72 volatile compounds were identified in the 14 apple ciders using dynamic headspace sampling (DHS) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The main volatile compounds found in apple ciders were esters and higher alcohols, followed by aldehydes and fatty acids. Sensory characterizations of the aroma and taste of apple ciders were carried out by a trained sensory panel using descriptive analysis with 23 sensory attributes. The attributes apple, cooked apple, yeasty, sweet and sour were the most predominant sensory descriptors used to describe the similarities and differences in the samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that floral and fruity (fresh apple, banana and pear) odors were highly associated with sweet taste and opposed to the more complex aroma attributes (yeasty, lactic, chemical, mouldy, black pepper and earthy) and sour taste. Most of the UK apple ciders were characterized by these complex odors and taste notes sour, astringent and bitter, whereas ciders from the Scandinavian region had diverse sensory profiles. Partial least squares regression (PLS) based on the sensory and chemical data was able to cluster the ciders according to differences in production methods (oak-aged or spontaneous fermentation; controlled malolactic fermentation; industrial production with flavor modifications).

Additionally, 40 g subsamples (after freezing) were further comminuted using a cryomill device with liquid nitrogen, and test portions of 5, 2, and 1 g were analyzed (n = 4 each). Both low-pressure gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LPGC-MS/MS) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS/MS were used for analysis. An empirical approach was followed to isolate and estimate the measurement uncertainty contribution of each step in the overall method by adding quality control spikes prior to each step. Addition of an internal standard during extraction normalized the sample preparation step to 0% error contribution, and coefficients of variation (CVs) were 6-7% for the analytical steps (LC and GC) and 6-9% for the sample processing techniques. In practice, overall CVs averaged 9-11% among the different analytes, commodities, batches, test portion weights, and analytical and sample processing methods. On average, CVs increased up to 4% and bias 8-12% when using 1-2 g test portions vs. 10-15 g.

Up to now, very little has been known about the Maillard reaction of fructose in food. Heyns rearrangement compounds (HRCs), the first stable intermediates of the Maillard reaction between amino components and fructose, have not yet been quantitated as protein-bound products in food. Therefore, the HRCs glucosyllysine and mannosyllysine were synthesized and characterized by NMR. Protein-bound HRCs in cookies containing various sugars and in commercial bakery products were quantitated after enzymatic hydrolysis by RP-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS in the multiple reaction monitoring mode through application of the standard addition method. Protein-bound HRCs were quantitated for the first time in model cookies and in commercial bakery products containing honey, banana, and invert sugar syrup. Concentrations of HRCs from 19 to 287 mg/kg were found, which were similar to or exceeded the content of other frequently analyzed Maillard reaction products, such as N-ε-carboxymethyllysine (10-76 mg/kg), N-ε-carboxyethyllysine (2.5-53 mg/kg), and methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 (10-218 mg/kg) in the analyzed cookies.

Material and methods: The content and bioaccesibility (soluble and dialysable fractions) of Fe and Zn were determined. For thisin vitro gastrointestinal digestion in a first phase of gastric digestion (pepsin) followed by a second phase of intestinal digestion (with pancreatin and bile salts) was simulated. The atomic absorption spectrometry mineral content measured in soluble and dialyzable fractions. 
Results: Traditional porridges from Honduras (PTH) showed low density of micronutrients being the PTH prepared based on “rice with beans and greens”, “rice with ground beans” and “beans with banana” which had a higher content values of 1.96, 1.56, and 1.46 mg Fe/100 g, respectively, although in vitroavailability values below 50% of its content. For Zn in these recipes, the values found were very low being below the detection limit. In relation to industrial porridges (PIH), those of “rice”, “wheat with milk” and “5 cereals” they had a higher content of Fe (9.4, 8.53 and 7.56 mg Fe/100 g, respectively).

Here we investigate the effects of thermal processing of crustacean extracts on cellular immune reactivity. Raw and cooked black tiger prawn, banana prawn, mud crab and blue swimmer crab extracts were prepared and IgE reactivity assessed by ELISA. Mass spectrometry revealed a mix of several allergens in the raw mud crab extract but predominant heat-stable tropomyosin in the cooked extract. PBMC from crustacean-allergic and non-atopic control subjects were cultured with the crab and prawn extracts and proliferation of lymphocyte subsets was analysed by CFSE labelling and flow cytometry. Effector responses were assessed by intracellular IL-4 and IFN-γ, and regulatory T (CD4+CD25+CD127loFoxp3+) cell proportions in cultures were also compared by flow cytometry. For each crustacean species, the cooked extract had greater IgE reactivity than the raw (mud crab p<0.05, other species p<0.01). In contrast, there was a trend for lower PBMC proliferative responses to cooked compared with raw extracts. In crustacean-stimulated PBMC cultures, dividing CD4+ and CD56+ lymphocytes showed higher IL-4+/IFN-γ+ ratios for crustacean-allergic subjects than for non-atopics (p<0.01), but there was no significant difference between raw and cooked extracts. The percentage IL-4+ of dividing CD4+ cells correlated with total and allergen-specific IgE levels (prawns p<0.01, crabs p<0.05). Regulatory T cell proportions were lower in cultures stimulated with cooked compared with raw extracts (mud crab p<0.001, banana prawn p<0.05). In conclusion, cooking did not substantially alter overall T cell proliferative or cytokine reactivity of crustacean extracts, but decreased induction of Tregs. In contrast, IgE reactivity of cooked extracts was increased markedly. These novel findings have important implications for improved diagnostics, managing crustacean allergy and development of future therapeutics.

Since pyrethroid degradates can be identical to the urinary markers used in human biomonitoring, it is important to understand the contribution of these degradates when studying sources of human pyrethroid exposure. We modified the widely used Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe (QuEChERS) method to measure several current-use pyrethroids (cis/trans-permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and cyhalothrin) and their environmental degradation products (3-PBA, cis/trans-DCCA, 4-F-3-PBA, DBCA, and MPA) in selected fresh fruits and vegetables. Using fortified samples, we determined extraction efficiencies from: tomatoes, oranges (whole, peeled, and rind), grapes, apples, bananas (peeled and rind only), onions, lettuce, green peppers, carrots and broccoli. For a subset of these food items (apples, grapes, tomatoes, lettuce and banana peel), we also established limits of detection (MDLs) and quantitation (MQLs). Each sample was homogenized (1kg) then spiked with the target pyrethroids and their degradation products. Sub-samples (15g) were extracted with acetonitrile, then salted out and partitioned with NaCl and MgSO4. The extract was divided and further cleaned using solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges containing either graphitized non-porous carbon (pyrethroids) or C18 (degradation products).

26452957,"A selective sorbent was prepared for the simultaneous separation and preconcentration of cadmium ion from water and fruit samples, prior to determination by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The sorbent was synthesized by combining of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and Aliquat(®)336 thiosalicylate, [A336][TS], a thiol-containing task specific ionic liquid (TSIL). The high affinity of TSIL toward the target compound as well as the magnetic behavior of Fe3O4 was combined to provide an efficient and simple magnetic sorbent for solid-phase extraction (SPE). The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The important parameters influencing the extraction efficiency such as pH, sorbent dosage, extraction and desorption conditions were studied and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear in the range of 2.5-260 ng mL(-1) and good linearity (R(2)>0.996) was obtained. The limit of detection (LOD) and enrichment factor (EF) of the method were found to be 0.5 ng mL(-1) and 50, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs %) were less than 3.1 (n=6) for the target analyte. In this method, only small amounts (20mg) of adsorbent were needed to obtain satisfactory extraction recoveries within 20 min.

26106398,"The water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) glucose, fructose, and sucrose are well-known to the great public, but fructans represent another type of WSC that deserves more attention given their prebiotic and immunomodulatory properties in the food context. Although the occurrence of inulin-type fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) was proposed in the fruit of some banana accessions, little or no information is available neither on the exact identity of the fructan species, nor on the fructan content in different parts of banana plants and among a broader array of banana cultivars. Here, we investigated the WSC composition in leaves, pulp of ripe fruits and rhizomes from mature banana plants of 11 accessions (I to XI), including both cultivated varieties and wild Musa species. High performance anion exchange chromatography with integrated pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-IPAD) showed the presence of 1-kestotriose [GF2], inulobiose [F2], inulotriose [F3], 6-kestotriose and 6G-kestotriose (neokestose) fructan species in the pulp of mature fruits of different accessions, but the absence of 1,1-nystose and 1,1,1 kestopentaose and higher degree of polymerization (DP) inulin-type fructans. This fructan fingerprint points at the presence of one or more invertases that are able to use fructose and sucrose as alternative acceptor substrates. Quantification of glucose, fructose, sucrose and 1-kestotriose and principal component analysis (PCA) identified related banana groups, based on their specific WSC profiles. These data provide new insights in the biochemical diversity of wild and cultivated bananas, and shed light on potential roles that fructans may fulfill across species, during plant development and adaptation to changing environments. Furthermore, the promiscuous behavior of banana fruit invertases (sucrose and fructose as acceptor substrates besides water) provides a new avenue to boost future work on structure-function relationships on these enzymes, potentially leading to the development of genuine banana fructosyltransferases that are able to increase fructan content in banana fruits.

The purposes of this study were (i) to evaluate which type of QuEChERS method was the most appropriate and effective for each matrix; (ii) to apply the selected QuEChERS method for each matrix, in order to detect and quantify pesticide residues in various fruit samples using UPLC-MS/MS; (iii) to examine the concentration distribution of pesticide classes among fruit originating from various areas; and (iv) to assess pesticide concentration distribution between peel and flesh of fruit in order to evaluate the penetration of pesticide residues in the fruit flesh. Acetate-buffered QuEChERS was found to be the most suitable technique for most of the fruit matrices. According to the recovery values at two different concentration levels, peaches should preferably be treated by the citrate-buffered type, whereas grapes, bananas, apples, pears, and strawberries are best treated by the acetate-buffered version, although the differences in efficiency were small. The addition of graphitized carbon black significantly decreases the recovery of specific pesticides in all matrices except for strawberries. The majority of values do not exceed the official maximum residue levels set by the European Commission. Organophosphates proved to be the most commonly detected category along with triazines-triazoles-conazoles group and by carbamates. Apples and pears seem to be the most contaminated fruit matrices among those tested. Distribution of pesticide classes shows variations between different regions, suggesting different pesticide application practices. In the case of peaches and pears, there is an equal distribution of detected pesticides between peel and flesh, indicating penetration of contaminants into the fruit flesh.

The goal of this work was to evaluate the influence of low temperature storage on the colour and carotenoid synthesis in two banana cultivars: Prata and Nanicão. For this purpose, the carotenoids from the banana pulp were determined by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS, and the colour of the banana skin was determined by a colorimeter method. Ten carotenoids were identified, of which the major carotenoids were all-trans-lutein, all-trans-α-carotene and all-trans-β-carotene in both cultivars. The effect of the low temperatures was subjected to linear regression analysis. In cv. Prata, all-trans-α-carotene and all-trans-β-carotene were significantly affected by low temperature (p<0.01), with negative estimated values (β coefficients) indicating that during cold storage conditions, the concentrations of these carotenoids tended to decrease. In cv. Nanicão, no carotenoid was significantly affected by cold storage (p>0.05).

So far, 5 IgE reactive banana proteins have been identified, and the major allergens are: Mus a 2 (a class I chitinase, 31kDa), Mus a 4 (thaumatin-like protein, 21kDa), and Mus a 5 (β-1,3-glucanase, 33kDa). Due to variations in allergen expression levels, diagnostic reagents for food allergy can be improved by using individual allergen components instead of banana allergen extracts. The purpose of this study was to optimize the purification protocol of the three major allergens present in banana fruit: Mus a 2, Mus a 4 and Mus a 5. By employing a three-step purification protocol (a combination of anion-exchange, cation-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography) three important banana allergens were obtained in sufficient yield and high purity. Characterization of the purified proteins was performed by both biochemical (2-D PAGE, mass fingerprint and N-terminal sequencing) and immunochemical (immunoblot) methods. IgE reactivity to the purified allergens was tested by employing sera of five allergic patients. The purified allergens displayed higher sensitivity in IgE detection than the routinely used extracts.

24725866,"A simple and rapid method for the simultaneous in situ derivatizaion, preconcentration and extraction of thiamine (vitamin B1) as a model analyte was developed by a novel quantitative method, namely ultrasound-assisted dispersive magnetic solid phase extraction spectrofluorimetry (USA-DMSPE-FL) from different real samples. This method consists of sample preparation, in situ derivatization, exhaustive extraction and clean up by a single process. High extraction efficiency and in situ derivatization in a short period of time is the main advantages of this procedure. For this purpose, the reusable magnetic multi-wall carbon nanotube (MMWCNT) nanocomposite was used as an adsorbent for preconcentration and determination of thiamine. Thiamine was, simultaneously, in situ derivatized as thiochrome by potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) and adsorbed on MMWCNT in an ultrasonic water bath. The MMWCNTs were then collected using an external magnetic field. Subsequently, the extracted thiochrome was washed from the surface of the adsorbent and determined by spectrofluorimetry.

24600405,"Odor information is predominantly perceived as complex odor blends. For Drosophila melanogaster one of the most attractive blends is emitted by an over-ripe banana. To analyze how the fly's olfactory system processes natural blends we combined the experimental advantages of gas chromatography and functional imaging (GC-I). In this way, natural banana compounds were presented successively to the fly antenna in close to natural occurring concentrations. This technique allowed us to identify the active odor components, use these compounds as stimuli and measure odor-induced Ca(2+) signals in input and output neurons of the Drosophila antennal lobe (AL), the first olfactory neuropil. We demonstrate that mixture interactions of a natural blend are very rare and occur only at the AL output level resulting in a surprisingly linear blend representation. However, the information regarding single components is strongly modulated by the olfactory circuitry within the AL leading to a higher similarity between the representation of individual components and the banana blend. This observed modulation might tune the olfactory system in a way to distinctively categorize odor components and improve the detection of suitable food sources. Functional GC-I thus enables analysis of virtually any unknown natural odorant blend and its components in their relative occurring concentrations and allows characterization of neuronal responses of complete neural assemblies. This technique can be seen as a valuable complementary method to classical GC/electrophysiology techniques, and will be a highly useful tool in future investigations of insect-insect and insect-plant chemical interactions.

Pesticide concentration decreased with distance from upstream banana plantations in this river system (F = 20.76; p = 0.00). Caiman body condition was negatively correlated with total pesticide concentrations (F = 6.23; p = 0.02) and with proximity to banana plantations (F = 5.05; p = 0.04). This suggests that either pesticides elicited toxic effects in caiman, resulting in diminished overall health, or that the quantity or quality of their prey was reduced by pesticides downstream of plantation waterways.

Parameters including the dispersive component of the surface energy, surface heterogeneity, surface area, as well as acid-base surface properties were determined for saponin modified banana micro and nanofibres. These parameters show a more extensive saponin coating on the nanofibres with a network formation which is explained by the higher reactivity of nanofibres due to the higher surface energy, specific interaction and higher surface area presented by the nanofibres. The energetic profile indicates that both micro and nanofibres coated with saponin interact with the same, or similar, energy active sites. Saponin treatment reduces considerably the surface area of the fibres, with the consequent decrease in the monolayer capacity. The interaction with the polar probes clearly indicates that saponin treatment creates new polar active sites for specific interactions in both samples.

The fruit volatiles were collected using dynamic headspace adsorption, and the volatile components were analyzed by auto thermal-desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to assess which volatiles existed in the fruits. Only alcohols, esters, and ketones were common in the volatiles of all six fermenting fruits. The five volatile components found in the six fruits, as well as two others found to be in other fermented foods by previous studies, were selected to test the behavioral and electroantennogram (EAG) responses of naive adults to estimate behavioral preference and antennal perception. In field behavioral tests, alcohols were the most attractive, followed by esters, while α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were much less attractive. Relative to other volatile combinations and ethanol alone, the mixture of ethyl acetate and ethanol attracted the most feeding adults. The number of adults attracted was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of both ethanol and ethyl acetate.

Moreover, F. oxysporum MIAE01197 exhibited a higher EC50 value than the reference strain F. oxysporum MIAE00047. This further suggests its adaptation to chlordecone tolerance up to 29.2 mg l(-1). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that 40 % of chlordecone was dissipated in F. oxysporum MIAE01197 suspension culture. No chlordecone metabolite was detected by GC-MS. However, weak amount of (14)CO2 evolved from (14)C10-chlordecone and (14)C10-metabolites were observed. Sorption of (14)C10-chlordecone onto fungal biomass followed a linear relationship (r (2) = 0.99) suggesting that it may also account for chlordecone dissipation in F. oxysporum MIAE01197 culture.",Environmental science and pollution research international,"['D001483', 'D018533', 'D007631', 'D025141', 'D005658', 'D007306', 'D008969', 'D028521', 'D012987', 'D012988', 'D012989', 'D014900']","['Base Sequence', 'Biomass', 'Chlordecone', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Fungi', 'Insecticides', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Musa', 'Soil', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Soil Pollutants', 'West Indies']",Characterization of chlordecone-tolerant fungal populations isolated from long-term polluted tropical volcanic soil in the French West Indies.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000235', 'Q000302', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, 'analysis', 'genetics', 'isolation & purification', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872892,2014
23582855,"A novel alumina nanowire (ANW) solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber coating was prepared by a simple and rapid anodization-chemical etching method for ultra-selective determination of volatile esters and alcohols from complicated food samples. Preparation conditions for ANW SPME fiber coating including corrosion solution concentration and corrosion time were optimized in detail for better surface morphology and higher surface area based on scanning electron microscope (SEM). Under the optimum conditions, homogeneous alumina nanowire structure of ANW SPME fiber coating was achieved with the average thickness of 20 μm around. Compared with most of commercial SPME fiber coatings, ANW SPME fiber coatings achieved the higher extraction capacity and special selectivity for volatile esters and alcohols. Finally, an efficient gas sampling technique based on ANW SPME fiber coating as the core was established and successfully applied for the ultra-selective determination of trace volatile esters and alcohols from complicated banana and fermented glutinous rice samples coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) detection. It was interesting that 25 esters and 2 alcohols among 30 banana volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified and 4 esters and 7 alcohols among 13 identified VOCs of fermented glutinous rice were selectively sampled by ANW SPME fiber coatings. Furthermore, new analytical methods for the determination of some typical volatile esters and alcohols from banana and fermented glutinous rice samples at specific storage or brewing phases were developed and validated. Good recoveries for banana and fermented glutinous rice samples were achieved in range of 108-115% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.6-6.7% and 80.0-91.8% with RSDs of 0.3-1.3% (n=3), respectively.

23419788,"Hydroxyapatite [HAP, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] is the main inorganic component of bone material and is widely used in various biomedical applications due to its excellent bioactivity and biocompatibility. In this paper we have reported the synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanorods by green template method using the extracts of three different natural sources which contain tartaric acid and also from commercially available one. The extracts of banana, grape and tamarind are taken as the sources of tartaric acid. The as-synthesized samples were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). Also the antibacterial activity of HAP with different concentrations against two pathogen bacteria strains Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella (Gram-negative bacteria) were tested. The results show that the particles of all the samples are of nanosized and pure. The crystallinity decreases as changing the sources of tartaric acid from commercial to natural one and also changing the natural sources from banana to tamarind extracts. The formation of nanorods are found in all the samples but the nanorods with uniform size distribution can be obtained only by using the tamarind extract as the source of tartaric acid. Moreover, the as-synthesised HAP nanorods derived from natural sources exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against both E. coli and Klebsiella at a concentration of 100 μl. The HAP nanorods synthesized by this method can act as a potential candidate for various biomedical applications.","Spectrochimica acta.

In this study, the molecular properties of an AGAMOUS like MADS box transcription factor in banana cultivar Giant governor (Musa sp, AAA group, subgroup Cavendish) has been elucidated. We have detected a CArG-box sequence binding AGAMOUS MADS-box protein in banana flower and fruit nuclear extracts in DNA-protein interaction assays. The protein fraction in the DNA-protein complex was analyzed by mass spectrometry and using this information we have obtained the full length cDNA of the corresponding protein. The deduced protein sequence showed ~95% amino acid sequence homology with MA-MADS5, a MADS-box protein described previously from banana. We have characterized the domains of the identified AGAMOUS MADS-box protein involved in DNA binding and homodimer formation in vitro using full-length and truncated versions of affinity purified recombinant proteins. Furthermore, in order to gain insight about how DNA bending is achieved by this MADS-box factor, we performed circular permutation and phasing analysis using the wild type recombinant protein. The AGAMOUS MADS-box protein identified in this study has been found to predominantly accumulate in the climacteric fruit pulp and also in female flower ovary. In vivo and in vitro assays have revealed specific binding of the identified AGAMOUS MADS-box protein to CArG-box sequence in the promoters of major ripening genes in banana fruit. Overall, the expression patterns of this MADS-box protein in banana female flower ovary and during various phases of fruit ripening along with the interaction of the protein to the CArG-box sequence in the promoters of major ripening genes lead to interesting assumption about the possible involvement of this AGAMOUS MADS-box factor in banana fruit ripening and floral reproductive organ development.",PloS one,"['D000595', 'D001483', 'D002467', 'D003001', 'D018076', 'D018744', 'D019281', 'D035264', 'D005638', 'D018506', 'D026161', 'D008969', 'D028521', 'D010940', 'D011401', 'D011485', 'D017422', 'D014157']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA, Plant', 'Dimerization', 'Flowers', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'MADS Domain Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Musa', 'Plant Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors']","Characterization of an AGAMOUS-like MADS box protein, a probable constituent of flowering and fruit ripening regulatory system in banana.","[None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'genetics', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22984496,2013

The effects of adding analyte protectants were evaluated for compensating matrix effects and the impacts on the quantitative results. A new combination of analyte protectants - Polyethylene Glycol 400 (PEG 400) and olive oil combination, which can be dissolved in acetone, was used for the quantitative analysis. The pesticides were extracted from fruit samples with acetonitrile and the extracts were cleaned up using micro-solid phase extraction. A GC-MS method in selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode coupled with large volume injection was finally developed. Using the newly developed analyte protectant combination of PEG 400 and olive oil, a good linearity was obtained in the range of 1 - 200 microg/L with coefficients better than 0.99, and the detection limits were between 0.1 - 3.0 microg/L.

22104385,"Stable-isotope ratios (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) and mercury in a model predator, and associated prey community assessments were used to make inferences regarding food web relationships and how these relationships are influenced by habitat variability and anthropogenic factors. Although interconnected, the three major basins of the Indian River Lagoon system on the Atlantic coast of Florida comprise noticeably different available habitat types with spatially distinct faunal communities and available prey for spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus, a model predatory fish species. Water quality, degree of urbanization, human population density, and levels of nitrogen enrichment clearly differ between these representative estuarine basins. The differences can influence feeding ecology and therefore result in different mercury concentrations and different stable-isotope signatures of spotted seatrout between basins. Mercury concentrations in spotted seatrout were greatest in Mosquito Lagoon (ML) and least in the Indian River Lagoon proper (IRL), although concentrations were low for all basins. Spotted seatrout from IRL were carbon-depleted and nitrogen-enriched compared with those from the other basins; this suggests either that the fish's primary source of carbon in IRL is an algae- or phytoplankton-based food web or that the pathway through the food web is shorter there. The δ(15)N values of IRL spotted seatrout were greater than those in the Banana River Lagoon or ML, suggesting slightly different trophic positioning of fish in these basins. The greater δ(15)N values in IRL spotted seatrout may also reflect the greater human population density and resultant anthropogenic inputs (e.g., observed higher total nitrogen levels) in IRL compared with the other more pristine basins examined.

21238751,"For this work, thirteen types of fruit juices (orange, pineapple, peach, apple, multifruit, mango, strawberry, tomato, pear, mandarin, grape, banana and grapefruit) were selected to develop an analytical method for the analysis of 53 pesticides by direct injection in LC-MS/MS. The preparation of the samples was very simple: an aliquot of the juice was centrifuged and it was ten-times diluted prior to analysis, which allowed reducing considerably the time and cost of the analyses. Besides, dilution of the samples permits reducing the amount of matrix going into the system, and thus, decreasing the matrix effects, so common in this type of commodities, opening the possibility to perform quantification with solvent based standards. Validation of the method was carried out in accordance with EU guidelines. Calibration curves covering three orders of magnitude were performed, and they were linear over the concentration range studied for all the matrices (from 0.1 to 100 μg L(-1)). Practical limits of quantification were in the low μg L(-1) range, far below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) of the EU regulations, which do not set specific MRLs for juices, and in this cases of processed food, MRLs of the raw product are applied. Repeatability of the instrumental method was studied in all matrices, obtaining good intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs). The proposed method was applied to 106 real fruit juice samples purchased in different local markets during a one-year survey in order to validate the suitability for routine analysis. 43% of the analysed samples gave positive results (higher than the practical limits of quantification).",Talanta,"['D001628', 'D002853', 'D005060', 'D005638', 'D010573', 'D010865', 'D053719']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Europe', 'Fruit', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Pilot Projects', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Pesticide residue analysis of fruit juices by LC-MS/MS direct injection.

21095007,"Allergies to certain fruits such as banana, avocado, chestnut and kiwi are described in 30-70% of latex-allergic patients. This association is attributed to the cross-reactivity between the major latex allergen hevein and hevein-like domains (HLDs) from fruit class I chitinases. We aimed to assess the extent of cross-reactivity between hevein and HLDs using sera from latex-allergic patients with and without plant food allergy. Hevein and HLDs of latex, banana, and avocado chitinases were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with the maltose-binding protein and purified by affinity chromatography. IgE binding to these proteins was studied in sera from 59 latex-allergic patients and 20 banana-allergic patients without latex allergy by ELISA and ELISA inhibition. Additionally, 16,408 allergic patients' sera were tested for IgE binding to hevein, latex chitinase, and wheat germ agglutinin using an allergen microarray. Hevein-specific IgE was detected in 34/59 (58%) latex-allergic patients' sera. HLDs of latex, banana, and avocado chitinases were recognized by 21 (36%), 20 (34%), and 9 (15%) sera, respectively. In contrast, only one of 20 banana-allergic patients without latex allergy was sensitized to chitinase HLDs. In most tested latex-allergic patients' sera, IgE binding to hevein was only partially reduced by preincubation with HLDs. Among hevein-sensitized, latex-allergic patients, the percentage of plant food allergy (15/34 = 44%) was equal to latex-allergic patients without hevein sensitization (11/25 = 44%). In the general allergic population, 230 of 16,408 sera (1.4%) reacted to hevein and/or a hevein-like allergen. Of these, 128 sera showed an isolated sensitization to hevein, whereas only 17 bound to latex chitinase or wheat germ agglutinin without hevein sensitization. In conclusion, the IgE response to HLDs is elicited by hevein as sensitizing allergen in most cases.

20549329,"Adults of the sorghum chafer, Pachnoda interrupta Olivier (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Cetoniinae), form aggregations during the mating period in July, but also in October. The beetles aggregate on food sources, e.g., Acacia spp. trees or sorghum with ripe seeds, to feed and mate. During the mating season, field trapping experiments with live beetles as bait demonstrated attraction of males to unmated females, but not to mated females or males, indicating the presence of a female-emitted sex pheromone. Unmated females combined with banana (food source) attracted significantly more males and females than did unmated females alone. Other combinations of beetles with banana were not more attractive than banana alone. Thus, aggregation behavior appears to be guided by a combination of pheromone and host volatiles. Females and males were extracted with hexane during the mating period, and the extracts were compared by using GC-MS. In a field trapping experiment, 19 compounds found only in females were tested, both singly and in a mixture. Traps baited with one of the female-associated compounds, phenylacetaldehyde, caught significantly more beetles than any other treatment. However, the sex ratio of beetles caught in these traps did not differ from that of control traps, and it is possible that other components may be involved in the sex pheromone signal. Furthermore, traps baited with a mixture of all 19 compounds attracted significantly fewer beetles than did phenylacetaldehyde alone.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000079', 'D000818', 'D001517', 'D005260', 'D008401', 'D008297', 'D028521', 'D012724', 'D012726']","['Acetaldehyde', 'Animals', 'Coleoptera', 'Female', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Male', 'Musa', 'Sex Attractants', 'Sexual Behavior, Animal']","Pheromone-based mating and aggregation in the sorghum chafer, Pachnoda interrupta.","['Q000031', None, 'Q000502', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000502', None]","['analogs & derivatives', None, 'physiology', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'physiology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20549329,2010

Although the structures of PrP from several species have been solved, still little is known about the mechanisms that lead to the misfolded species. Here, we show that the region of PrP comprising the hairpin formed by the helices H2 and H3 is a stable independently folded unit able to retain its secondary and tertiary structure also in the absence of the rest of the sequence. We also prove that the isolated H2H3 is highly fibrillogenic and forms amyloid fibers morphologically similar to those obtained for the full-length protein. Fibrillization of H2H3 but not of full-length PrP is concomitant with formation of aggregates. These observations suggest a ""banana-peeling"" mechanism for misfolding of PrP in which H2H3 is the aggregation seed that needs to be first exposed to promote conversion from a helical to a beta-rich structure.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D000682', 'D000818', 'D002850', 'D002942', 'D004926', 'D014644', 'D006801', 'D007700', 'D009682', 'D008854', 'D019636', 'D011328', 'D011487', 'D011489', 'D017510', 'D012756', 'D013816']","['Amyloid', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Prions', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Folding', 'Sheep', 'Thermodynamics']",Prion fibrillization is mediated by a native structural element that comprises helices H2 and H3.,"['Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000209', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, None, None, None, 'etiology', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375014,2010

Carbendazim (CB), thiabendazole (TB) and fuberidazole (FB) were extracted in a single step and no clean-up or concentration of extracts was needed. The high extraction efficiency obtained for BFs was a result of the different types of interactions provided by the supramolecular solvent (e.g. hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds) and the high number of solubilisation sites it contains. Besides simple and efficient, the proposed extraction approach was rapid, low-cost, environment friendly and it was implemented using conventional lab equipments. The target analytes were determined in the supramolecular extract by LC/fluorescence detection.

19700165,"This paper describes a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) procedure using room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection capable of quantifying trace amounts of eight pesticides (i.e. thiophanate-methyl, carbofuran, carbaryl, tebuconazole, iprodione, oxyfluorfen, hexythiazox and fenazaquin) in bananas. Fruit samples were first homogenized and extracted (1g) with acetonitrile and after suitable evaporation and reconstitution of the extract in 10 mL of water, a DLLME procedure using 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C(6)MIM][PF(6)]) as extraction solvent was used. Experimental conditions affecting the DLLME procedure (sample pH, sodium chloride percentage, ionic liquid amount and volume of disperser solvent) were optimized by means of an experimental design. In order to determine the presence of a matrix effect, calibration curves for standards and fortified banana extracts (matrix matched calibration) were studied. Mean recovery values of the extraction of the pesticides from banana samples were in the range of 69-97% (except for thiophanate-methyl and carbofuran, which were 53-63%) with a relative standard deviation lower than 8.7% in all cases. Limits of detection achieved (0.320-4.66 microg/kg) were below the harmonized maximum residue limits established by the European Union (EU). The proposed method, was also applied to the analysis of this group of pesticides in nine banana samples taken from the local markets of the Canary Islands (Spain).

Pesticides were extracted from infant foods by using the procedure known as the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method. Quantification was based on matrix-matched standard calibration curves with the use of an isotopically labeled standard or a chemical analogue as the internal standard to obtain method accuracy. The method performance parameters, including overall recovery, intermediate precision, and measurement uncertainty, were evaluated on the basis of a nested design. The performance results were calculated by using a compiled SAS program that provided a semiautomated procedure for handling a large number of calculations in a few seconds. In general, the overall recoveries, for spiking levels of 10, 50, and 80 microg/kg, fell in a range of 81-110%, intermediate precisions were <20%, and measurement uncertainties were <40%.

18817409,"The chemical composition of the lipophilic extracts of unripe pulp and peel of banana fruit 'Dwarf Cavendish' was studied by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fatty acids, sterols, and steryl esters are the major families of lipophilic components present in banana tissues, followed by diacylglycerols, steryl glucosides, long chain fatty alcohols, and aromatic compounds. Fatty acids are more abundant in the banana pulp (29-90% of the total amount of lipophilic extract), with linoleic, linolenic, and oleic acids as the major compounds of this family. In banana peel, sterols represent about 49-71% of the lipophilic extract with two triterpenic ketones (31-norcyclolaudenone and cycloeucalenone) as the major components. The detection of high amounts of steryl esters (469-24405 mg/kg) and diacylglycerols (119-878 mg/kg), mainly present in the banana peel extract, explains the increase in the abundance of fatty acids and sterols after alkaline hydrolysis. Several steryl glucosides were also found in significative amounts (273-888 mg/kg), particularly in banana pulp (888 mg/kg).

Evidence is mainly against all-E-beta-carotene, while there is no evidence against other carotenoids or against mixtures of beta-carotene stereoisomers. Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets. Population consumption patterns of carotenoid isomers using a comprehensive database are used to improve our understanding in disease prevention.

The quantitative application at residue levels has been proven for two insecticides (buprofezin and hexythiazox), which were satisfactorily determined at three concentration levels, 0.1, 1, and 5 mg/kg, obtaining a suitable linearity range (correlation coefficient>0.99) of more than 2 orders of magnitude. Satisfactory recoveries have been obtained for both compounds at the three levels tested in all sample matrices, with lowest calibration levels (LCL) of 0.075 and 0.01 mg/kg. The excellent potential of QTOF for identification purposes is illustrated by the high number of identification points (IPs) earned, up to 21, at the highest concentration of 5 mg/kg, or between 11 and 21 at the 0.1 and 1 mg/kg levels. The application of LC-QTOF MS to real samples revealed the presence of several positives at concentrations close to the LCL, all of which were confirmed with more than 11 IPs. The potential of QTOF for elucidation of nontarget analytes has also been demonstrated by the finding of one transformation product (TP) of buprofezin in a banana skin sample. This TP was identified by obtaining the full scan product ion spectra at different collision energies with acceptable accurate mass deviation. The work performed in this paper illustrates the suitability and excellent confirmatory potential of LC-QTOF MS for pesticides residues analysis in food samples.",Analytical chemistry,"['D002853', 'D005638', 'D013058', 'D015394', 'D010573', 'D012680']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Fruit', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",Use of liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry to investigate pesticide residues in fruits.,"['Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000295', None, 'Q000032', None]","['methods', 'chemistry', 'instrumentation', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17309229,2007

Maturity monitoring is thus of paramount importance for postharvest handling and fruit quality regulation. Ideal analytical procedures for maturity investigation require high sensitivity, specificity, and high throughput and should be noninvasive. For the purpose of maturity differentiation, extractive electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (EESI-QTOF-MS) is developed for rapid fingerprinting of compounds released from various fruits. Ripening stages of bananas, grapes, and strawberries are successfully differentiated by performing principal component analysis (PCA) of the mass spectral fingerprints of the fruits.

Fuji flesh contains substantial levels of 2-methyl butyl acetate (fruity banana-like odor), while the flesh of cv. Granny Smith apples lacks this compound. Granny Smith apples accumulate mainly hexyl acetate (apple-pear odor) in their peel. Feeding experiments indicated that Fuji apples were able to convert hexanol and 2-methyl butanol to their respective acetate derivatives in vivo, while Granny Smith apples could only convert exogenous hexanol to hexyl acetate. Differential substrate specificities of the in vitro acetyl-CoA:alcohol acetyl transferase (AAT) activities were also detected among cultivars. In Granny Smith apples, the AAT activity was detected only in the peel, and its specificity was almost exclusively restricted to hexanol and cis-3-hexenol. In Fuji apples, the AAT activity was detected in both peel and flesh and apparently accepted a broader range of alcohols as substrates than the Granny Smith enzyme activity.

To ensure homogeneity before analysis, laboratory samples are normally slurried with water in the ratio of 5 parts fruit to 4 parts water, and test materials in this form were used in the study. The test portion was extracted with acidified methanol. The extract was filtered, diluted with phosphate-buffered saline, and applied to an affinity column. The column was washed and ochratoxin A was eluted with methanol. Ochratoxin A was quantified by reversed-phase LC. The use of post-column pH shift to enhance the fluorescence of ochratoxin A by the addition of 1.1 M ammonia solution to the column eluant is optional. Determination was by fluorescence.

12770245,"Multicellular electrophysiological responses from the dorsal organ on the cephalic lobes of third instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae (wild-type Canton S) stimulated with a cold-trapped banana volatile extract showed that this structure has an olfactory function in the fruit fly. Responses of the dorsal organ were also recorded to constituents of the banana volatile extract as they eluted from a gas chromatographic column (GC-coupled dorsal organ electrophysiology). The active chemostimulants were identified as 2-heptanone, isoamyl alcohol, hexyl acetate, hexanol and hexyl butyrate by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Applying the same recording system to the terminal organ sensilla, no responses were obtained to either the banana volatile bouquet or its constituents. By contrast, high frequency multicellular responses were recorded in response to touching the terminal organ with the gustatory stimuli KCl and grapefruit juice; responses were absent on similar stimulation of the dorsal organ with either NaCl or KCl. This suggests a role for olfaction by the dorsal organ and for gustation by the terminal organ in Drosophila larvae.In a 7-mm high wind tunnel with a thin 1.2% agar floor, the Drosophila larvae showed odour-conditioned upwind responses in an air stream of 0.1 m/s bearing banana volatiles. Drosophila larvae responded best to the odour of cut bananas.

These foods were chosen for their relevance in human and animal nutrition and prepared as they are usually eaten by humans. As confirmed by further investigations the precaecal digestibility is a valuable measure for determining the availability of native B-vitamins. Therefore, pigs were fitted with an end-to-end ileo-rectal anastomosis for digesta passing straight from ileum to rectum, thus avoiding endogenous vitamin synthesis by the colon. Three weeks after surgery the digestibility experiments were carried out during which the animals were fed various experimental diets for a period of 12 days and digesta were collected quantitatively twice a day during the final 5 days of this period. The concentration of vitamin B6 in foods and chyme was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Precaecal digestibility of vitamin B6 from all tested food sources ranged from 51 to 91% in the following order: cabbage diet > banana diet > fish diet > milk powder diet > brewer's yeast diet > soybeans diet > soybean meal diet > egg diet/corn diet > barley diet > wheat bran diet > rye diet.

The current residue definition of dithiocarbamates in food for compliance with maximum residue limits, at national and international levels, is total residues arising from the use of any or each dithiocarbamate fungicide, determined as CS(2). The analytical method most frequently used to analyze dithiocarbamate residues in food for monitoring purposes was proposed more than 30 years ago. In this method, total dithiocarbamates are decomposed to CS(2), which is purified and reacted with a cupric reagent. The yellow complex formed is quantified by spectrophotometry. In this paper, a new reaction system for the purification and complexation of CS(2) is proposed.

No measurable amounts of F3 and GF4 were detected within the group of studied fruit products. Peak identification was realized using standards. The method is easy, reproducible, and sensitive since as little as 28 microg of sugar per gram dry matter can be quantified.

The immunoassay is based on a new monoclonal antibody derived from a hapten functionalized at the nitrogen atom in the 1-position of the thiabendazole structure. To our knowledge, such a structure has not been previously used to obtain antibodies to thiabendazole. The I50 value and the detection limit of the ELISA for standards were 0.2 and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively. Fruit juices were analyzed by diluting samples in assay buffer, without extraction or cleanup. Samples were not even centrifuged or filtered to remove fruit pulp. Under these conditions, the immunoassay was able to accurately determine thiabendazole down to 1 ng/mL in orange and grapefruit juices, down to 5 ng/mL in banana juice, and down to 20 ng/mL in apple and pear juices. Sensitivity differences of the ELISA were caused by the minimum dilution required by each juice to minimize matrix effects: 1/10 for orange and grapefruit juices, 1/50 for banana juice, and 1/100 for apple and pear juices. In an attempt to further increase the sensitivity of the immunoassay for matrixes showing the strongest interferences, apple and pear juices spiked with thiabendazole at low levels (1-20 ng/mL) were extracted with ethyl acetate before analysis. This simple procedure entailed a significant reduction of matrix effects, which in fact allowed us to determine accurately as low as 5 ng/mL thiabendazole in apple and pear juices.

For suppressing the oxygen uptake of linoleic acid in an emulsion and scavenging a diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical, dopamine had greater antioxidative potency than glutathione, food additives such as butylated hydroxyanisole and hydroxytoluene, flavone luteolin, flavonol quercetin, and catechin, and similar potency to the strongest antioxidants gallocatechin gallate and ascorbic acid. Banana contained dopamine at high levels in both the peel and pulp. Dopamine levels ranged from 80-560 mg per 100 g in peel and 2.5-10 mg in pulp, even in ripened bananas ready to eat.

10605888,"The partitioning characteristics of selected carbamate insecticides (carbaryl, aldicarb, bendiocarb and pirimicarb) on five fruit and vegetable types were investigated. Post-harvest samples were surface-saturated with a methanolic-aqueous mixed carbamate spiking solution for a number of time periods. Samples were taken at 3, 7, 10 and 14 d, and extracted using supercritical CO2 at pressure = 300 atm modified with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Extracts were analysed by HPLC-postcolumn reaction-fluorescence detection at lambda ex = 330 nm and lambda em = 450 nm for N-methylcarbamates and at lambda ex = 315 nm and lambda em = 380 nm for pirimicarb. The relative partitioning of each insecticide between sample skin and flesh was investigated. This included the determination of both half-life and normalised matrix metabolic rate studies with respect to each carbamate. Multilinear regression (MLR) was applied to a number of insecticide and matrix-based variables to develop regression models for carbamate partitioning for each matrix type studied. Experimentally derived carbamate half-lives ranged from 3.6 d (carbaryl in pear flesh) to 8.0 d (bendiocarb in banana skin). Determinations of normalised metabolic rates were based on calculating the time period from the point of sampling through to the point where carbamate concentration was reduced to 5% of its initial value. These values ranged from 16.2 d (bendiocarb in potato skin) to 34.7 d (bendiocarb in banana skin). Although no practicable MLR partitioning models were obtained, it was found that the models created indicated that carbamate solubility in water (and hence log P) and the number of days in contact with the spiking solution were the most important parameters in model construction.",The Analyst,"['D002219', 'D002851', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D006801', 'D007306', 'D014675']","['Carbamates', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Insecticides', 'Vegetables']",Surface partitioning studies of N-methylcarbamate-treated post-harvest crops using SFE-HPLC-postcolumn reaction-fluorescence.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000493', 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'pharmacokinetics', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10605888,2000

7791097,"The role of delta opioid receptors in the self-administration and discrimination of cocaine by rhesus monkeys was evaluated using the delta opioid antagonist naltrindole and the delta opioid agonist BW373U86 [(+/-)-4-((alpha R*)-alpha-((2S*,5R*)-4-Allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1- piperazinyl)-3-hydroxybenzyl)-N,N-diethylbenzamide dihydrochloride]. In the self-administration studies, monkeys were trained to respond for food (1 g banana pellets) or cocaine (0.032 mg/kg/injection, i.v.) under a second-order FR4(VR16:S) schedule of reinforcement during multiple daily food and drug sessions. Substitution of saline or other unit doses of cocaine (0.001-0.1 mg/kg/injection) for the maintenance dose of cocaine yielded typical inverted-U shaped dose-effect curves relating unit dose of cocaine to the number of saline or drug injections per day. The unit dose of cocaine available during drug sessions had little effect on food-maintained responding. In the drug discrimination studies, monkeys were trained to discriminate 0.4 mg/kg cocaine (i.m.) from saline in a two-lever, food-reinforced drug discrimination task. Cumulative dosing with cocaine (0.004-1.3 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent generalization to the training dose of cocaine without consistently altering response rates. Initial experiments with naltrindole (0.1-3.2 mg/kg, i.v. or i.m.) produced effects in some monkeys suggesting that naltrindole may have antagonized the effects of cocaine under both procedures. In the drug self-administration studies, treatment with at least one dose of naltrindole for 10 consecutive days decreased self-administration of a unit dose of cocaine at the peak of the ascending limb of the cocaine dose-effect curve (0.01 mg/kg/injection) in three of four monkeys. In the drug discrimination studies, treatment with at least one dose of naltrindole shifted the cocaine dose-effect curve 1/2 log unit to the right in two of four monkeys. However, naltrindole did not alter the effects of cocaine in all monkeys under either procedure. Furthermore, in the monkeys in which naltrindole was effective, the cocaine-antagonist actions of naltrindole were not replicable and were not monotonically related to dose. When the delta agonist BW373U86 (0.001-0.032 mg/kg/inj, i.v.) was substituted for cocaine in one monkey in which naltrindole decreased cocaine self-administration, BW373186 was not self-administered. In addition, BW373U86 (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg, i.m.) neither generalized to cocaine nor potentiated the effects of cocaine in the drug discrimination procedure.

Rats were given chronic third ventricle cannulas and patency was verified. In experiment 1, rats were divided into three groups and ICV infused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (a-CSF) or b-SAT: group 1, a-CSF (n = 11); group 2, 20 micrograms/rat, b-SAT (n = 11); and group 3, 40 micrograms/rat, b-SAT (n = 9). Infusions were repeated thrice three days apart. Compared to a-CSF, the high b-SAT dose suppressed food intake for 24-h after each successive infusion. The low dose significantly decreased food intake only after the first infusion. Water intake was suppressed only after the first injection of the high dose. Body weight was decreased after the first and second infusions of both doses and following the third infusion of the high dose.

Blood was obtained at ages 140, 168, and 196 d of age, and the test meal was fed under standardized conditions at 154 d of age. Erythrocyte incorporation of the 58Fe label was determined from the increase in the mass isotope ratio, 58Fe/57Fe, from the baseline value (at 140 d of age) to the follow-up values. The mass isotope ratio was determined by inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Geometric mean total iron incorporation into erythrocytes from the test meal of MJEBF fortified with ferrous sulfate (food 2) was 0.05 mg, and from the vegetable-beef product test meal (food 3) was 0.08 mg. The low value for MJEBF is presumably explained by the low level of iron fortification. The low value for the vegetable-beef product may reflect the presence of inhibitors of iron absorption. Geometric mean erythrocyte incorporations of iron from the test meals with foods 1, 4 and 5 were 0.15, 0.14, and 0.18 mg, respectively.

The amounts of serotonin found were 10--30 ppm in bananas, 0.1--1.9 ppm in banana-based baby foods, 4.4--5.6 ppm in fresh tomatoes, and 2.8--5.6 ppm in canned tomatoes.",Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,"['D002855', 'D005504', 'D005638', 'D007225', 'D012701', 'D013050', 'D014675']","['Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Food Analysis', 'Fruit', 'Infant Food', 'Serotonin', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Vegetables']",Spectrofluorometric determination and thin layer chromatographic identification of serotonin in foods.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7380787,1980
950991,"With regard to routine analyses in market control, the authors recommend two methods (according to the expected amounts of active principle) for the determination of thiabendazole residues on citrus fruits and bananas. The ultraviolet spectrophotometric method is preferable in determining thiabendazole contents of more than 1 p.p.m., if the cleaning operations described are respected. For the detection of thiabendazole and for the determination of amounts of less than 1 p.p.m. (the tolerance limit being 0.2 p.p.m. for pomes, berries, stone fruits, kernel fruits and also for potatoes) the thin-layer chromatographic method seems likewise to be suited (also in considering that it is semi-quantitative by nature); especially since the spectrophotometric method yields values by 0.2 p.p.m. too high (due to the measurement of residual absorption of vegetable constituents). The authors are of opinion that such an error must be considered to be too high for contents lower than 1 p.p.m.",Die Nahrung,"['D002855', 'D002957', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D010573', 'D013056', 'D013827']","['Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Citrus', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Thiabendazole']",[Analysis of thiabendazole in citrus fruits and bananas].,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/950991,1976
4790566,"An increased yield of the crude material with antibacterial and antifungal activity produced by Passiflora species was obtained by aerated bathing of cut rinds of banana passion fruit in water in rotating cylindrical bottles. The crude material was separated into several fractions by thin-layer chromatography with the use of silica gel and ethyl acetate-chloroform (2:1). The fractions showing ultraviolet absorption maxima in the vicinity of 340, 358, and 375 to 377 nm were biologically active. The data indicate that the active material, here called ""Passicol"" for the first time, has characteristics of the polyacetylenic group of compounds. The activity can be preserved for a long time when crude material is stored in organic solvent in the dark at 6 C. Gentle bathing of the cut rinds of Passiflora in water in the presence of air and ethylene stimulated the formation of the active principle.",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"['D000480', 'D000900', 'D000935', 'D055598', 'D002627', 'D002855', 'D010946', 'D013056']","['Alkynes', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']","Passicol, an antibacterial and antifungal agent produced by Passiflora plant species: preparation and physicochemical characteristics.","[None, 'Q000302', 'Q000302', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4790566,1974
