34833884,"Rapeseed meal (RSM), a by-product of oilseed extraction connected to the agri-food and biofuel sectors, is currently used as animal feed and for other low-value purposes. With a biorefinery approach, RSM could be valorized as a source of bio-based molecules for high-value applications. This study provides a chemical characterization of RSM in the perspective of its valorization. A qualitative study of main functional groups by fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was integrated with a chemical characterization of macronutrients, minerals by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), phenolic acids and lipid components by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), HPLC-diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector (GC-MS/FID). The study, conducted on different lots of RSM collected over a one-year period from an oil pressing factory serving a biofuel biorefinery, highlighted a constant quality over time of RSM, characterized by high protein (31-34%), fiber (33-40%) and mineral (5.5-6.8%) contents.

34812004,"Carbamate pesticides are a class of synthetic pesticides having wide antimicrobial spectrum, good insecticidal efficacy, and a short residual period. These pesticides are used in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Their widespread use in the last two decades has led to the existence of drug residues in the environment, which are transferred to food, thereby raising concerns regarding the potential threat to human health. Rapid and accurate detection of carbamate pesticide residues in food is of great significance for food safety, and this requires pretreatment to purify the target components and maximize the accuracy and precision of the analysis. A rapid and accurate analytical method based on online solid phase extraction/purification-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (online SPE-HPLC-MS/MS) was established for the determination of eight carbamate pesticides in tomato, rice, and cabbage.

In this study, a differentially expressed protein (0305), was found between control and clubroot-diseased Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L.) roots through two-dimensional electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that Bra003466 was highly matched to protein 0305. Because the sequence of Bra003466 had 89% percent identity with ATG6 of Arabidopsis thaliana and other Brassica, the gene was named as BrATG6. However, 790 bp sequences were mismatched with the cDNA sequence of the Bra003466 gene from the Brassica database. In this study, we cloned the cDNA of Bra003466 and found the BrATG6 was highly expressed in roots among all organs. When plants were inoculated with P. brassicae Woronin, the expression of BrATG6 was significantly increased in infected roots of Chinese cabbage. This result was verified by reverse transcription-qPCR and in situ hybridization. Examination of disease resistance showed that, compared with wild type plants, A. thaliana ATG6 deletion mutants were more easily infected by P. brassicae than WT.

In order to solve this problem, herein, an innovative portable and quantitative photothermal assay platform relying on a thermometer readout for the detection of CBZ has been developed. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which exhibit a strong distance-dependent photothermal effect under specific laser irradiation, were utilized as indicators. The CBZ aptamer was introduced to protect AuNPs from salt-mediated aggregation. When CBZ is present, the binding event between CBZ and aptamer leads to the loss of the aptamer protective effect on AuNPs, and AuNP aggregation occurs. Under 650-nm laser irradiation, the increase in temperature associated with an AuNP-dependent photothermal effect is highly related to the CBZ concentration.

Sol-gel method was used to coat HC-POF on the glass stir bar. The prepared HC-POF coated stir bar shows better extraction performance for six triazole fungicides (TFs) compared to commercial polydimethylsiloxane and ethylene glycol-silicone coated stir bars. Fourier transform infrared Spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron Spectrometry were used to explore interactions between HC-POF coating and TFs. It is assumed that the coating mainly adsorbs TFs through π-π interactions, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.

The concentrations of 10 odorants (OAV ≥ 1) detected by gas chromatography-olfactometry changed significantly after fermentation by P. pentosaceus. Using ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, 49.47% of the non-volatile metabolites were classified as lipids and lipid-like molecules. The relative expressions of five non-volatile metabolites that exhibited significant correlations with odorants using Spearman correlation analysis changed significantly after fermentation.

32339843,"In Southern China, rice-oil rotations occur on soils with high levels of cadmium (Cd) and low levels of available boron (B). Boron can alleviate Cd toxicity, as it affects the plant cell wall structures and the components that block the entry of Cd into the cytoplasm; however, these mechanisms are not well understood. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), fluorescent probe dye, electron microscope, ion abundance (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), metabonomics and transcriptomics were used in the study, and we found that under Cd stress, B increased root pectin content by affecting the biosynthesis pathways and decreasing the activity of pectinase and the expression levels of related genes. The increased pectin content and pectin demethylation increased the chelation of Cd onto the cell walls and reduced the levels of Cd entering the organelles. Application of B to the roots decreased the amounts of cellulose and hemicellulose in the cell walls to normal levels and promoted the expression of genes from the expansin, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase, and α-xylosidase families. This contributed to cell wall integrity and root flexibility. Consequently, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species was inhibited and cell viability in the roots was increased, which reduced the destruction of root surface structures.

Nevertheless, changes on its phenolic composition and mineral content originated by its cooking have not been investigated in-depth so far. Here we report the phytochemical profile of broccolini before and after boiling, steaming, and griddling cooking treatments. The mineral content and phytochemicals were assessed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), respectively. The main phenolics (mainly hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives from caffeic, coumaric, ferulic and sinapic acids) were quantified. Three oxylipins, three flavonoid glycosides and the glucosinolate glucobrassicin were also identified. ABTS and DPPH assays were also used as screening methods to assess the antioxidant potential of broccolini. A significant loss of the phenolic compounds and a reduction of the antioxidant activity were observed after the three cooking methods. Clear disadvantages were detected when broccolini was boiled, namely high losses of phenolic acids and derivatives (70%). Steaming and griddling also led to a significant loss of phenolics (50%) from fresh broccolini.

Sample preparation was performed by the QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) method. Average recovery rates at the different spiked levels (0.05 and 0.25 mg/kg) were in the range of 103.6-113.9% (acetamiprid) and 80.8-91.2% (chlorantraniliprole), and the relative standard deviations were ≤4.3% for all. The dissipation kinetics were assessed using first-order equations after spraying acetamiprid and chlorantraniliprole individually on kimchi cabbages. The biological half-lives in field 1 and 2 were 5.2 and 6.3 days (acetamiprid) and 10.0 and 15.2 days (chlorantraniliprole), respectively. Based on the dissipation equations, the pre-harvest residue limits (PHRLs) corresponding to each day before harvest were suggested as the guidelines to meet the MRL on harvest day.

High levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the leafy vegetables may pose a significant health hazard to the consumers. Rose/Hibiscus, Chinese cabbage, lettuce, and garden egg leaves from farms along the Nima Creek, Accra, were selected. At each sampling site, the vegetable was uprooted and cut into leaves, stem, and root and analyzed differently. The GC-MS method was employed in the identification and quantification of 16 PAHs in the samples. The analysis was done at CSIR - Water Research Institute Organic Laboratory. The results obtained show concentrations of acenapththylene, acenapthene, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benzo[a]pyrene (except chrysene and pyrene which were found in garden egg leaves and Chinese cabbage respectively), while naphthalene was detected in all the vegetables.

To evaluate the residual dissipation pattern and risk for dietary intake of chlorfluazuron in various vegetables, a solid phase extraction-ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was established to analyze chlorfluazuron residues in Chinese cabbage, Chinese kale, Chinese lettuce, and cauliflower. The sample was extracted with acetonitrile and purified using an SPE amino column. The average recovery of the target sample in the analyzed four vegetables was between 75.0% and 104.1%, and the relative standard deviation was between 2.5% and 9.6%. The precision and accuracy of the analysis met the requirements of residue analysis standards. Dissipation kinetic testing of chlorfluazuron in different vegetables showed a half-life of 2.4-12.6 days, with a rapid dissipation rate. The estimated daily intake of the chlorfluazuron was 0.753-1.661 μg/(kg bw·d), and the risk quotient was 0.15-0.35. It showed that chlorfluazuron had a low risk of chronic dietary intake from vegetables in different populations in China.

There is limited information on using wood- and animal-derived biochars for the remediation of co-contaminated soils. Therefore, a pot experiment was conducted using Brassica chinensis L. as a bio-indicator plant to investigate the effect of P. orientalis biochar and pig biochar application on the bioavailability of cadmium (Cd) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and on plant physiological parameters (malondialdehyde, proline and soluble sugars). Biochar materials were applied to two soils containing low (LOC) and high (HOC) organic carbon content at rates of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4%. To better understand the influence of biochar, physicochemical properties and X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), Fourier transform-infrared spectrometry (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were characterized. Biochar application increased soil pH, organic carbon content, and available phosphorus content. Increasing biochar application rates decreased DTPA-extractable Cd and extractable DEHP concentrations in both soils. Biochar application reduced the plant uptake of both Cd and DEHP from co-contaminated soils; the maximum reduction of Cd (92.7%) and DEHP (52.0%) was observed in 2% pig biochar-treated LOC soil. The responses of plant physiological parameters to increased biochar applications indicated that less Cd and DEHP were taken up by plants. Pig biochar was more effective (P < 0.05) at reducing the bioavailability of Cd and DEHP in both soils than P. orientalis biochar; therefore, pig biochar had greater potential for improving the quality of the crop. However, the highest application rate (4%) of pig biochar restricted plant seed germination. Key factors influencing the bioavailability of Cd and DEHP in soils were soil organic carbon content, biochar properties (such as surface alkalinity, available phosphorus content and ash content) and biochar application rates.",The Science of the total environment,"['D001937', 'D002104', 'D002606', 'D004051', 'D052918', 'D012989']","['Brassica', 'Cadmium', 'Charcoal', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Environmental Restoration and Remediation', 'Soil Pollutants']",Effect of biochars on the bioavailability of cadmium and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate to Brassica chinensis L. in contaminated soils.,"['Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075602,2019

30036953,"Lambda-cyhalothrin (λ-cyhalothrin) is the most commonly used pyrethroid insecticide for vegetable farming in Benin. This insecticide is misused and overused by farmers, and hence may pose health hazards to consumers. We monitored λ-cyhalothrin residues in lettuce and cabbage from farms at the market gates in Cotonou and Parakou using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis techniques. These residues were also monitored on samples directly from farms (on-farm sampling) for 14 days post-treatment. Potential factors such as photolysis and hydrolysis involved in λ-cyhalothrin degradation were also screened. Results revealed that the level of λ-cyhalothrin residue concentrations in lettuce from Houeyiho decreased from 4.2 mg/kg on Day 1 to about 0.2 mg/kg on Day 7. On Day 9, analyzed lettuces were all λ-cyhalothrin free. In contrast, even 14 days after treatment of cabbage from Bawera (Parakou), we still recorded the presence of λ-cyhalothrin residues in analyzed samples. For samples from market gates, λ-cyhalothrin residues were found in lettuce from two markets out of the nine surveyed in Cotonou. Interestingly, none of these contaminated samples had residues above the maximum residue limit for lettuce (MRL = 0.5 mg/kg). Similarly, in Parakou, samples from all five surveyed vegetable markets were contaminated with λ-cyhalothrin residues at concentrations below the MRL for cabbage (MRL = 0.2 mg/kg).

Comprehensive compositional analysis by two metabolomic approaches based on NMR and solid-phase microextraction-GC/MS methods was used to determine its chemical composition by annotating 54 water-soluble and 62 volatile compounds. Principal component analysis showed that samples had different compositions, depending on the agricultural processing factory and production year. This variation potentially resulted from the differences in the lactic acid bacterial community produced during the spontaneous fermentation of sunki and in the initial nutritional composition of the turnip leaf. Partial least squares regression revealed that the acetic acid level showed a strong positive correlation with pH (R = 0.810), in contrast to the negative correlations of lactic acid and ethanol levels (R =  -0.533 and -0.547).

Potential differences in Se-metabolism were evaluated based on the total Se concentrations along with non-protein Se speciation patterns in the urine and blood serum of the rats. The total Se concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Se compounds in the samples were identified through high-performance liquid chromatography/ICP-MS. The total Se excretion rate was dose-dependent, and excess of dietary Se was eliminated in the form of Se-sugar 1, regardless of the administered Se-form. The excretion dynamics of dietary selenomethionine (soybean meal) and methylselenocysteine (Se-DRS) were different to that of the mineral Se (Se-salt). The proportions of Se species in the urine were significantly influenced by the Se source. A specific metabolic pathway, resulting in urinary excretion of Se-sugar 2, was observed in animals fed Se-DRS. Neither the total Se concentrations nor the serum Se speciation patterns differed between the animals fed the conventional diet and those fed the Se-DRS-enriched diet.

For the first time, this strategy was applied for building multivariate regression models. Reference analyses and spectral data were obtained from diluted extracts. The determinate properties were total and monomeric anthocyanins, total polyphenols and antioxidant capacity by ABTS (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonate)) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) methods.

drug intake on the formation of tooth discoloration. A total of 500 patients aged 15-25 years were
examined to take part in the study. Of these, 60 patients were selected and divided into two groups of
30 patients each. Group 1 included patients with black pigmentation on vestibular/oral tooth surfaces.
Group 2 included patients without discoloration (control). Data were recorded in a questionnaire.
Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine elements in discoloration samples. The Caries
Risk Test (CRT) buffer was used to assess buffer capacity of saliva, while CRT bacteria were used to
determine the presence of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. Statistically significant between-group
differences were found for the intake of collard greens and beets (p<0.05), but not for other
vegetables. As for drink consumption, patients with pigmentation reported less wine intake (p<0.05)
than those without pigmentation. There was no difference according to drug intake between patients
with and without pigmentation. Patients with pigmentation were older, smoked and had lower saliva
pH with lower presence of Streptococcus mutans than those without pigmentation (p<0.05). In tooth
discoloration samples, there were traces of calcium, magnesium, iron, copper and zinc. The appearance
of tooth discoloration is influenced by many factors, among which diet and saliva seem to be very

Steady-state concentrations (34 mg/kg) and BAF values (0.05) obtained for the snail directly exposed to contaminated soil were lower than trophic transfer by consumption of W-contaminated cabbage (tissue concentration of 86 mg/kg; BAF of 0.36). Thus, consumption of contaminated food is the most important pathway for W mobility in this food chain. The highest concentrations of W compartmentalization were in the snail's hepatopancreas based on wet chemistry and synchrotron-based investigations. Chemical speciation via inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry showed a higher degree of polytungstate partitioning in the hepatopancreas relative to the rest of the body.

In this study, a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics approach targeting urine metabolism has been applied to assess the potential roles of functional foods and exercise for obesity management in rats. Male albino rats diagnosed as obese via histopathology and biochemical assays were administered functional foods in common use for obesity management including pomegranate, grapefruit, and red cabbage juice extracts in parallel with swimming exercise. Urine samples were collected from these rats, and likewise from healthy control animals, for metabolite analysis using (GC-MS) coupled to multivariate data analysis. The results revealed a significant elevation in oxalate and phosphate levels in obese rat urine concurrent with lower lactate levels as compared to the control group. Furthermore, and to pinpoint the bioactive agents in the administered functional foods, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) was employed for secondary metabolite profiling. The different phenolic classes found in the examined functional foods, viz. ellagitannins in pomegranate, flavanones in grapefruit and flavonols in red cabbage, are likely to mediate their anti-obesity effects.

27591592,"In this study, an aptamer-based fluorescent sensing platform using triple-helix molecular switch (THMS) was developed for the pesticide screening represented by acetamiprid. The THMS was composed of two tailored DNA probes: a label-free central target specific aptamer sequence flanked by two arm segments acting as a recognition probe; a hairpin-shaped structure oligonucleotide serving as a signal transduction probe (STP), labeled with a fluorophore and a quencher at the 3' and 5'-end, respectively. In the absence of acetamiprid, complementary bindings of two arm segments of the aptamers with the loop sequence of STP enforce the formation of THMS with the ""open"" configuration of STP, and the fluorescence of THMS is on. In the presence of target acetamiprid, the aptamer-target binding results in the formation of a structured aptamer/target complex, which disassembles the THMS and releases the STP. The free STP is folded to a stem loop structure, and the fluorescence is quenched. The quenched fluorescence intensity was proportional to the concentration of acetamiprid in the range from 100 to 1200nM, with the limit of detection (LOD) as low as 9.12nM. In addition, this THMS-based method has been successfully used to test and quantify acetamiprid in Chinese cabbage with satisfactory recoveries, and the results were in full agreement with those from LC-MS. The aptamer-based THMS presents distinct advantages, including high stability, remarkable sensitivity, and preservation of the affinity and specificity of the original aptamer. Most importantly, this strategy is convenient and generalizable by virtue of altering the aptamer sequence without changing the triple-helix structure. So, it is expected that this aptamer-based fluorescent assay could be extensively applied in the field of food safety inspection.

The complete enantioseparation was conducted by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with a cellulose-tris-(4-methylbenzoate) chiral stationary phase (CSP) (Lux Cellulose-3). The effects of different mobile phase compositions, temperatures, and flow rates on enantioseparation were also investigated. The experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra indicate that the first peak is (S)-(+)-isofenphos-methyl and the second peak is (R)-(-)-isofenphos-methyl. Alumina-A and Florisil solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns were used to clean up for vegetable, fruit, and soil samples. The mean recoveries of the two enantiomers ranged from 83.2 to 110.9 % with intra-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) from 3.2 to 10.8 % and inter-day RSDs from 3.6 to 10 %. Good linearity (≥0.9992) was obtained for the two enantiomers in all matrix-matched calibration curves in the range of 0.25 to 20 mg L(-1). The limit of detection for two enantiomers in six matrices was in the range of 0.008 to 0.011 mg kg(-1), and the limit of quantification was estimated to range from 0.027 to 0.037 mg kg(-1).

A novel bacteriocin-producing strain, Lactobacillus plantarum JLA-9, isolated from Suan-Tsai, a traditional Chinese fermented cabbage, was screened and identified by its physiobiochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. A new bacteriocin, designated plantaricin JLA-9, was purified using butanol extraction, gel filtration, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The molecular mass of plantaricin JLA-9 was shown to be 1044 Da by MALDI-TOF-MS analyses. The amino acid sequence of plantaricin JLA-9 was predicted to be FWQKMSFA by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, which was confirmed by Edman degradation. This bacteriocin exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially Bacillus spp., high thermal stability (20 min, 121 °C), and narrow pH stability (pH 2.0-7.0). It was sensitive to α-chymotrypsin, pepsin, alkaline protease, and papain. The mode of action of this bacteriocin responsible for outgrowth inhibition of Bacillus cereus spores was studied. Plantaricin JLA-9 had no detectable effects on germination initiation over 1 h on monitoring the hydration, heat resistance, and 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) release of spores. Rather, germination initiation is a prerequisite for the action of plantaricin JLA-9. Plantaricin JLA-9 inhibited growth by preventing the establishment of oxidative metabolism and disrupting membrane integrity in germinating spores within 2 h.

26460365,"This paper describes a convenient and rapid fluorescence sensor for determination of paraquat (PA) based on glutathione-capped CdS quantum dots (QDs). The methodology enabled the use of a simple synthesis procedure for water solubilization of CdS QDs via a fast route using glutathione as a capping agent within 15 min. The resulting water-soluble QDs exhibit a strong fluorescence emission at 536 nm with high and reproducible photostability. PA is an important class of electron acceptors for QDs. Thus, the fluorescence intensity of the glutathione-capped CdS QDs probe could be dramatically quenched by PA due to the electron transfer mechanism. The fluorescence intensity of the CdS QDs system was proportional to PA concentration in the range of 0.025 to 1.5 μg mL(-1), with a detection limit of 0.01 μg mL(-1). The time of analysis sample, including preparation of QDs and fluorescent measurement for PA, was only 20 min. Most of the potentially coexisting substances did not interfere with the PA-induced quenching effect except diquat. Furthermore, the analytical applicability of the proposed method was demonstrated by analyzing PA in water, rice and cabbage samples, and the recoveries were between 86 and 105% which satisfied the requirement of detection for PA. These results showed that the proposed method was simple in design and fast in operation, and could be used as a sensitive tool for detecting PA in environmental and agricultural samples.

26121908,"During storage of shredded cabbage, characteristic sulfurous volatile compounds are formed affecting cabbage aroma both negatively and positively. Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) was used to measure the concentration of cabbage volatiles during storage. The volatile levels of cabbage samples were measured at pH 3.3 to 7.4 at 4 °C for 14 d, and pH 3.3 at 25 °C for 5 d in order to determine the effect of pH and temperature. Aroma intensity, best aroma, freshness, and off odor were evaluated in a sensory test of the samples at 4 °C. The desirable volatile allyl isothiocyanate was lower in high pH samples (pH 7.4 and 6.4), whereas higher concentrations were detected in low pH samples (pH 3.3 and 4.6). Lipoxygenase volatiles, which produce a fresh green and leafy aroma in cabbage, were generated in very low amounts at any pH value. High pH samples generated significantly higher concentrations of off odors such as dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and methanethiol. Sensory tests showed that higher pH samples had significantly stronger off odor and lower desirable cabbage aroma than lower pH samples. Thus, sensory results matched the volatile results in that samples at higher pH levels formed the highest amount of undesirable volatiles and the least amount of desirable volatiles. Storage at 25 °C produced similar concentrations of allyl isothiocyanate, but significantly higher levels of off odors, than at 4 °C. Shredded cabbage products should be stored in low pH dressings to minimize formation of off odors and maximize formation of characteristic, desirable cabbage odor.

26041523,"A novel bare-eye based one-step signal amplified semi-quantitative immunochromatographic assay (SAS-ICA) was developed for detection of the pesticide imidacloprid. This method was based on competitive immunoreactions. Signal amplification was achieved by dual labeling of the test lines (TLs) on the strip using high affinity nanogold-biotinylated anti-imidacloprid mAb (BAb) and nanogold-streptavidin (Sa) probes. The relative color intensities of three TLs (TL-I, TL-II and TL-III) on a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane were used for direct visual analysis of the SAS-ICA strips, and could be used for semi-quantitation of analyte concentrations by observing what TLs disappeared in the amplification zone. Under optimized conditions, the following imidacloprid concentration ranges would be detected by visual examination of the SAS-ICA strip: 0-5ngmL(-1) (negative samples), and 5-25ngmL(-1), 25-250ngmL(-1), 250-1000ngmL(-1) and >1000ngmL(-1) (positive samples). The sensitivity (the visual detection limit (VDL) of TL-III) and semi-quantitative analytical capacity (when TL-III disappeared completely) of the SAS-ICA strip were 10-fold and 160-fold higher than those of traditional ICA, respectively. The developed SAS-ICA strip was applied to the analysis of spiked and authentic contaminated Chinese cabbage samples in the laboratory and under field conditions, and the results were validated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This process could be adopted as a potential generous technique for all ICA-based detection methods.

26038320,"Malathion is an organophosphorous insecticide for controlling insects on fruits and vegetables, miscellaneous household insects, and animal parasites. It is important to develop highly efficient and selective pre-treatment method for analyzing malathion residues in environment and samples from agricultural products based on the molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). In this study, we developed a tailor-made MIP method with highly specific recognization to the template. The MIPs were prepared using malathion as a template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as a functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as a crosslinker, azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator, and the acetonitrile-chloroform (1:1, v/v) as a porogen. The molecular recognization mechanism of malathion and MAA was evaluated by molecular simulation, ultraviolet spectrometry (UV), and (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR). MAA interacted specifically with malathion by hydrogen bond with a ratio of 2:1. The MIPs exhibit a high affinity, recognition specificity, and efficient adsorption performance for malathion. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), surface area and porosimeter analyzer, thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyzer (TG/DTA) were used to characterize the properties of MIP. The malathion residues in soil, tap water, and cabbage were cleaned up by MIP-SPE, detected quantitatively using GC-FPD, and confirmed by GC-MS/MS. The limits of tap water, soil, and cabbage were confined to 0.001 mg L(-1), 0.004 and 0.004 mg kg(-1), respectively. The spiked recoveries of malathion were 96.06-111.49% (with RSD being 5.7-9.2%), 98.13-103.83% (RSD, 3.5-8.7%), and 84.94-93.69% (RSD, 4.7-5.8%) for tap water, soil, and cabbage samples, respectively.

The principle of sensor is based on the fluorescence quenching and binding properties of Fe(2+) toward QDs and CA, respectively. To provide a fluorescence turn-on mode for CA detection, Fe(2+) is first mixed with QDs solution, leading to a low fluorescence emission. With the addition of CA, the fluorescence of QDs is recovered due to the strong binding interaction between CA and Fe(2+). Thus, a QDs-based label-free fluorescence sensor, designed in a simple mix-and-detect format, is established for CA detection.

25380470,"This paper describes the comparison of five sample cleanup procedures for the determination of 238 pesticides via triple quadrupole liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, with only 10 min of chromatographic running time) in Chinese cabbage and cucumber. Samples were extracted with a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuECHERS) preparation method and cleanup with different sorbents, including primary secondary amine (PSA), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and polystyrene (PLS), to find out the most suitable cleanup methods for Chinese cabbage and cucumber. The recovery and matrix effect were evaluated by monitoring the main parameters in one group of 238 pesticides at the spiked level of 8 and 40 μg/kg. In Chinese cabbage, when PSA dispersive solid-phase extraction (D-SPE) was applied, recoveries of 183 pesticides ranged between 70 and 120% with relative standard deviation (RSD) values lower than 20% at a spiked level of 40 μg/kg, indicating the effectiveness of the purification step. In cucumber, 203 pesticides were in the 70-120% recovery range with good reproducibility by PSA mini-cartridge column cleanup at a spiked level of 40 μg/kg and RSD values were generally below 20%. The limits of quantitation [LOQs; signal-to-noise (S/N) = 10] were in the range of 0.16-10.20 μg/kg for Chinese cabbage and 0.06-21.06 μg/kg for cucumber, while the limits of detection (LODs; S/N = 3) were between 0.05 and 3.06 μg/kg and between 0.02 and 6.32 μg/kg in Chinese cabbage and cucumber, respectively. The proposed methods that might be applied for the multi-residue analysis in Chinese cabbage and cucumber are contributed to their rapid speed and good recoveries.

In the present study, we determined aqua-regia (AR) and water-extractable TEs of four BC types (woodchips (WC), wheat straw (WS), vineyard pruning (VP), pyrolyzed at 525 °C, of which VP was also pyrolyzed at 400 °C) and studied their effects on TE concentrations in leachates and mustard (Sinapis alba L.) tissue in a greenhouse pot experiment. We used an acidic, sandy agricultural soil and a BC application rate of 3% (w/w). Our results show that contents and extractability of TEs in the BCs and effectuated changes of TE biogeochemistry in the soil-water-plant system strongly varied among the different BC types. High AR-digestable Cu was found in VP and high B contents in WC. WS had the highest impact on TEs in leachates showing increased concentrations of As, Cd, Mo, and Se, whereas WC application resulted in enhanced leaching of B. All BC types increased Mo and decreased Cu concentrations in the plant tissue; however, they showed diverging effects on Cu in the leachates with decreased concentrations for WC and WS, but increased concentrations for both VPs. Our results demonstrate that BCs may release TEs into the soil-water-plant system. A BC-induced liming effect in acidic soils may lead to decreased plant uptake of cationic TEs, including Pb and Cd, but may enhance the mobility of anionic TEs like Mo and As. We also found that BCs with high salt contents (e.g., straw-based BCs) may lead to increased mobility of both anionic and cationic TEs in the short term.",Environmental science and pollution research international,"['D000327', 'D000383', 'D000704', 'D002606', 'D004553', 'D004785', 'D052918', 'D006358', 'D006851', 'D013058', 'D019216', 'D009149', 'D017942', 'D012987', 'D014908', 'D027843', 'D014934']","['Adsorption', 'Agriculture', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Charcoal', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Environmental Restoration and Remediation', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrochloric Acid', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Mustard Plant', 'Nitric Acid', 'Soil', 'Triticum', 'Vitis', 'Wood']",Trace element biogeochemistry in the soil-water-plant system of a temperate agricultural soil amended with different biochars.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25315931,2015

An initial exploratory experiment indicated that the order of blending and thermal treatments had the highest impact on the phytochemicals in the purees. This blending-heating order effect was investigated in more depth by performing alternate blending-heating sequences in triplicate on the same batches of broccoli, tomato and carrot. For each vegetable and particularly in broccoli, a large proportion of the metabolites detected in the purees was significantly influenced by the blending-heating order, amongst which were potential health-related phytochemicals and flavour compounds like vitamins C and E, carotenoids, flavonoids, glucosinolates and oxylipins. Our metabolomics data indicates that during processing the activity of a series of endogenous plant enzymes, such as lipoxygenases, peroxidases and glycosidases, including myrosinase in broccoli, is key to the final metabolite composition and related quality of the purees.

Generally, bread supplementation elevated antioxidant potential of product (both nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant capacities); however, the increase was not correlated with the percent of BS. A replacement up to 2% of BS gives satisfactory overall consumers acceptability and desirable elevation of antioxidant potential. High activity was especially found for extracts obtained after simulated digestion, which allows assuming their protective effect for upper gastrointestinal tract; thus, the anticancer activity against human stomach cancer cells (AGS) was evaluated. A prominent cytostatic response paralleled by the inhibition of AGS motility in the presence of potentially mastication-extractable phytochemicals indicates that phenolic compounds of BS retain their biological activity in bread. Importantly, the efficient phenolics concentration was about 12 μM for buffer extract, 13 μM for extracts after digestion in vitro, and 7 μM for extract after absorption in vitro.

Broccoli sprouts contained high levels of glucoraphanin, a precursor for potent anticancer compound. Although studies have reported an inverse relationship between accumulation of Se and glucosinolates in mature Brassica plants, Se supply generally did not affect glucosinolate accumulation in Brassica sprouts.

Antifungal compounds from Lb. plantarum HD1 were active against food- and feed-borne filamentous fungi and yeasts in a spot-on-the-lawn assay. Antifungal activity of Lb. plantarum HD1 was stronger against filamentous fungi than yeast. Antifungal compounds were purified using solid phase extraction (SPE) and recycling preparative-HPLC. Structures of the antifungal compounds were elucidated by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Active compounds from Lb. plantarum HD1 were identified as 5-oxododecanoic acid (MW 214), 3-hydroxy decanoic acid (MW 188), and 3-hydroxy-5-dodecenoic acid (MW 214). To investigate the potential application of these antifungal compounds for reduction of fungal spoilage in foods, Korean draft rice wine was used as a food model. White film-forming yeasts were observed in control draft rice wine after 11 days of incubation. However, film-forming yeasts were not observed in draft rice wine treated with SPE-prepared culture supernatant of Lb. plantarum HD1 (equivalent to 2.5% addition of culture supernatant) until 27 days of incubation. The addition of antifungal compounds to Korean draft rice wine extended shelf-life up to 27 days at 10 °C without any sterilization process. Therefore, the antifungal activity of Lb. plantarum HD1 may lead to the development of powerful biopreservative systems capable of preventing food- and feed-borne fungal spoilage.

Our main objective here was to highlight the health risk associated with the consumption of vegetables exposed to foliar deposits of PM enriched with the various metal(loid)s frequently observed in the atmosphere of urban areas (Cd, Sb, Zn and Pb). Leaves of mature cabbage and spinach were exposed to manufactured mono-metallic oxide particles (CdO, Sb2O3 and ZnO) or to complex process PM mainly enriched with lead. Total and bioaccessible metal(loid) concentrations were then measured for polluted vegetables and the various PM used as sources. Finally, scanning electronic microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis was used to study PM-phyllosphere interactions. High quantities of Cd, Sb, Zn and Pb were taken up by the plant leaves. These levels depended on both the plant species and nature of the PM, highlighting the interest of acquiring data for different plants and sources of exposure in order to better identify and manage health risks. A maximum of 2% of the leaf surfaces were covered with the PM. However, particles appeared to be enriched in stomatal openings, with up to 12% of their area occupied.

Here, we examined the relationship between toxin production and the pathogenicity of Vmm strains and determined their bioactivities in several assays, for further elucidating the pathogenesis mechanisms of Vmm and for developing new procedures to control this disease. The toxins were quantified with the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, and the results showed that the strain with attenuated virulence produced low levels of toxins with only three to four kinds of compounds being detectable. In contrast, higher amounts of toxins were produced by the more aggressive strain, and all five compounds were detected. This indicated a significant correlation between the pathogenicity of Vmm strains and their ability to produce toxins. However, this correlation only existed in planta, but not in vitro. During the infection of Vmm, protocatechuic acid was first detected at three days post inoculation (dpi), and the others at seven or 11 dpi.

24013513,"A series of 695 food crops were collected on 539 soils throughout Belgium. All samples were collected on commercial production fields, omitting private gardens. All crops were analyzed for their selenium (Se) concentration. The soils represent different soil types occurring in Belgium, with soil textures ranging from sand to silt loam, and including a few clay soils. They were analyzed for Se concentration, organic carbon content, cation exchange capacity and extractable sulphur (S) concentration. The Se concentrations in the soils were low (range 0.14-0.70 mg kg(-1) dw), but increasing soil Se concentrations were observed with increasing clay content. Stepwise multiple regressions were applied to determine relations between Se concentrations in crops and soil characteristics. Among field crops, wheat is the most important accumulator of selenium but the concentration remains rather low on the Belgian low Se-soils. Based on dry weight, leafy vegetables contain more Se than wheat. The soil is the most important source of Se and the element is transported with the water stream to the leaves, where it is accumulated. Vegetables rich in S, e.g. some Brassica and Allium species, have a higher capacity to accumulate Se as it can replace S in the proteins, although this accumulation is still limited at low soil Se concentrations. In loamy soils, weak correlations were found between the soil Se concentration and its concentration in wheat and potato. The uptake of Se increased with increasing pH. The Se concentrations in Belgian soils are far too low to generate a driving force on Se uptake. General climatic conditions such as temperature, air humidity and soil moisture are also important for the transfer of Se within the plant, and plant linked factors such as cultivar, growth stage and edible part are important as well, although their influence remains limited at low soil Se concentrations.",The Science of the total environment,"['D000704', 'D001530', 'D018556', 'D004784', 'D013058', 'D012643', 'D012987']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Belgium', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Selenium', 'Soil']",Selenium content of Belgian cultivated soils and its uptake by field crops and vegetables.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000706', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'statistics & numerical data', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24013513,2014

The aim of this study was to determine which species of Se are most rapidly taken up and translocated to above-ground plant tissues. Specifically, we wished to determine if organic forms of Se in an exposure solution can contribute to the amount of Se found in shoot tissue. Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum) and spring canola (Brassica napus) were grown hydroponically, and young seedlings were exposed to 0.5 or 5.0 μM Se as selenate, selenite, seleno-methionione, or seleno-cystine for ≤300 min. Canola accumulated more Se than wheat, although the difference depended on Se speciation of the exposure solution. Organic forms of Se were taken up at a greater rate than inorganic forms. When exposed to 5.0 μM Se, the rate of uptake of selenite was 1.5- (canola) or 5-fold (wheat) greater than the rate of uptake of selenate, whereas seleno-methionine was taken up 40- (canola) or 100-fold (wheat) faster and seleno-cystine 2- (wheat) to 20-fold (canola) faster. Plants exposed to seleno-methionine had the highest shoot concentrations of Se even though selenate was more mobile once taken up; in plants exposed to selenate >50% of accumulated Se was translocated to shoot tissue. Because organic forms of Se (especially seleno-methionine) can be readily taken up and translocated to above-ground tissues of wheat and canola, these Se species should be considered when attempting to predict Se accumulation in above-ground plant tissues.",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D029688', 'D004784', 'D016566', 'D018520', 'D036226', 'D018036', 'D012989', 'D013054', 'D014908']","['Brassica napus', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Organoselenium Compounds', 'Plant Shoots', 'Seedlings', 'Selenium Compounds', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Triticum']",Plant uptake and translocation of inorganic and organic forms of selenium.,"['Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000187']","['drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23793939,2014

However, the specificity and role of plant volatiles induced during the early phase of attack, i.e. egg deposition by herbivorous insects, and their consequences on insects of different trophic levels remain poorly explored. In olfactometer and wind tunnel set-ups, we investigated behavioural responses of a specialist cabbage butterfly (Pieris brassicae) and two of its parasitic wasps (Trichogramma brassicae and Cotesia glomerata) to volatiles of a wild crucifer (Brassica nigra) induced by oviposition of the specialist butterfly and an additional generalist moth (Mamestra brassicae). Gravid butterflies were repelled by volatiles from plants induced by cabbage white butterfly eggs, probably as a means of avoiding competition, whereas both parasitic wasp species were attracted.

22886927,"The relationship between the ability to accumulate heavy metals (represented by Cd and Zn) and to synthesize bioactive compounds (represented by glucosinolates [GLS]) was investigated in two cabbage cultivars. Plants were grown in the greenhouse of a phytotron under controlled conditions in soils spiked with two different Zn or Cd concentrations. The measurements of Cd and Zn contents in soil and cabbage (leaf) samples were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy, whereas GLS levels in cabbage were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The ranges of metal contents in soil were 80 to 450 mg/kg dry weight for Zn and 0.3 to 30 mg/kg dry weight for Cd, whereas the levels of accumulated Zn and Cd in cabbage amounted to 15 to 130 and 0.02 to 3 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. After initial symptoms of toxicity, during a later stage of growth, the plants exhibited very good tolerance to both metals. Enhanced biosynthesis of GLS was observed in a dose-dependent manner following exposure to the heavy metals. The GLS content in Zn-exposed cabbage rose from 3.2 to 12 µmol/g dry weight, and the corresponding values for Cd-treated plants were 3.5 to 10 µmol/g dry weight. Thus, the increased soil contamination by metals caused greater accumulation in cabbage, as well as stimulation of GLS biosynthesis.

This extensive production is postulated to result in release into the environment with subsequent contamination of soils and plants; however, few studies have examined TiO₂-NP uptake and impact on plants. In this study, wheat and rapeseed plantlets were exposed to 14 nm or 25 nm anatase TiO₂-NP in hydroponics conditions, either through root or leaf exposure. Microparticle-induced x-ray emission (μPIXE) coupled with Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) was used to quantify absorbed titanium (Ti). Micro x-ray fluorescence (μXRF) based on synchrotron radiation was used to evaluate Ti distribution in roots and leaves. Our results show that both TiO₂-NP are accumulated in these plantlets upon root exposure and that Ti content is higher in rapeseed than wheat. Ti distribution in root cross sections depended on NP agglomeration state. NP are also accumulated in plantlets upon leaf exposure. Finally, it was found that TiO₂-NP exposure induced increased root elongation but did not affect germination, evapotranspiration, and plant biomass.

A potent radical scavenging compound was successfully isolated from roasted HEM seed oil in a single-step chromatographic separation using an amino solid-phase extraction column. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry spectra revealed the compound as 2,6-dimethoxy-4-vinylphenol (generally known as canolol), and its identity was fully confirmed by chemical synthesis. The formation of canolol during roasting was compared among HEM varieties (Brassica juncea, B. juncea var. oriental, Brassica nigra, and Sinapis alba) together with a low erucic rapeseed variety. HEM varieties were shown to produce less than one-third of canolol compared to rapeseed at similar roasting conditions. This observation was linked to a lower free sinapic acid content together with a lower loss of sinapic acid derivatives in the HEM varieties compared to rapeseed. Around 50% of the canolol formed in the roasted seed was shown to be extracted in the oil.

22351183,"The identification of metabolites in biochemical studies is a major bottleneck in the proliferating field of metabolomics. In particular in plant metabolomics, given the diversity and abundance of endogenous secondary metabolites in plants, the identification of these is not only challenging but also essential to understanding their biological role in the plant, and their value to quality and nutritional attributes as food crops. With the new generation of analytical technologies, in which liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) play a pioneering role, profiling metabolites in complex extracts is feasible at high throughput. However, the identification of key metabolites remains a limitation given the analytical effort necessary for traditional structural elucidation strategies. The hyphenation of LC-solid phase extraction (SPE)-NMR is a powerful analytical platform for isolating and concentrating metabolites for unequivocal identification by NMR measurements. The combination with LC-MS is a relatively straightforward approach to obtaining all necessary information for structural elucidation.

Brassicaceae plants contain a large variety of interesting secondary metabolites, including glucosinolates, hydroxycinnamic acids, and flavonoids. These metabolites are also of particular importance due to their proposed positive effects on human health. Next to these well-known groups of phytochemicals, many more metabolites are of course also present in crude extracts prepared from Brassica and Arabidopsis plant material.High-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), especially if combined with a high mass resolution instrument such as a QTOF MS, is a powerful approach to separate, detect, and annotate metabolites present in crude aqueous-alcohol plant extracts. Using an essentially unbiased procedure that takes into account all metabolite mass signals from the raw data files, detailed information on the relative abundance of hundreds of both known and, as yet, unknown semipolar metabolites can be obtained. These comprehensive metabolomics data can then be used to, for instance, identify genetic markers regulating metabolic composition, determine effects of (a)biotic stress or specific growth conditions, or establish metabolite changes occurring upon food processing or storage.This chapter describes in detail a procedure for preparing crude extracts and performing comprehensive HPLC-QTOF MS-based profiling of semi-polar metabolites in Brassicaceae plant material.

The chronic ingestion of cabbage of the same family is known to accelerate conjugating acetaminophen (AA) and decrease the plasma AA level. Therefore, we examined to clarify the effects of kale on the pharmacokinetics of AA, its glucuronide (AA-G) and sulfate (AA-S). AA was orally administered to rats pre-treated with kale or cabbage (2000 mg/kg/day) for one week. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein, and the concentrations of AA, AA-G and AA-S were determined. In results, kale ingestion induced an increase in the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and a decrease in the clearance of AA, whereas cabbage had almost no influence. In addition, there were significant differences in the AUC of AA-G between the control and kale groups. mRNA expression levels of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, the enzymes involved in glucuronidation, in the kale group were significantly higher than those in the control group. In conclusion, kale ingestion increased the plasma concentrations of both AA and AA-G. The results suggest that kale ingestion accelerates the glucuronidation of AA, but an increase of plasma AA levels has a different cause than the cause of glucuronidation.","Biomedical research (Tokyo, Japan)","['D000082', 'D018712', 'D000818', 'D001483', 'D001937', 'D002853', 'D017931', 'D018565', 'D014453', 'D008297', 'D012333', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D060888']","['Acetaminophen', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Brassica', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'DNA Primers', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",Effects of kale ingestion on pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen in rats.,"['Q000097', 'Q000097', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None]","['blood', 'blood', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22199125,2012

21770413,"In plants, folate occurs predominantly as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF) polyglutamyl forms. Differences in stability and bioavailability of food folate compared to synthetic folic acid have been attributed to the presence of the polyglutamyl chain. High-pressure processing (HPP) was tested for whether it might shorten polyglutamyl chains of 5MTHF species in fresh vegetables by enabling action of native γ-glutamylhydrolase (GGH). A validated ultrahigh-performance reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using stable isotope as internal standard was applied for characterizing 5MTHF polyglutamyl profiles. HPP conditions included 300, 450, and 600 MPa at 30 °C for 0 or 5 min, and vegetables were vacuum-packed before treatment. Investigated vegetables included cauliflower (Brassica oleracea), baby carrots (Daucus carota), and carrot greens (D. carota). HPP treatment caused conversion of polyglutamyl 5MTHF species to short-chain and monoglutamyl forms. Maximal conversion of polyglutamyl folate to monoglutamyl folate occurred at the highest pressure/time combination investigated, 600 MPa/30 °C/5 min. Under this condition, cauliflower monoglutamyl folate increased nearly 4-fold, diglutamyl folate 32-fold, and triglutamyl folate 8-fold; carrot monoglutamyl increased 23-fold and diglutamyl 32-fold; and carrot greens monoglutamyl increased 2.5-fold and the diglutamyl form 19-fold. Although some folate degradation was observed at certain intermediate HPP conditions, total 5MTHF folate was largely preserved at 600 MPa/5 min.

In this chapter, we describe a detailed protocol for metabolic engineering of carotenoids in potato plants with the Or gene and the analysis of the Or transformants.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","['D016960', 'D015152', 'D015139', 'D001937', 'D002338', 'D002851', 'D018744', 'D017343', 'D005818', 'D008853', 'D035281', 'D030821', 'D018087', 'D018749', 'D020133', 'D011198', 'D014170']","['Agrobacterium tumefaciens', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Brassica', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Microscopy', 'Plant Tubers', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Plastids', 'RNA, Plant', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Transformation, Genetic']",Modulation of carotenoid accumulation in transgenic potato by inducing chromoplast formation with enhanced sink strength.,"['Q000235', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000166', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000166', None]","['genetics', None, None, 'genetics', 'metabolism', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'methods', None, 'cytology', None, 'metabolism', 'genetics', None, 'cytology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20552445,2010
20546419,"This study was conducted to identify and quantify the sensory characteristics and chemical profile of organically and conventionally grown pac choi (Brassica rapa var. Mei Qing Choi), also called bok choy, at 3 stages of growth (2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 wk). Sensory and instrumental data were correlated using partial least squares regression. Pac choi was grown in late spring. Descriptive sensory analysis was conducted by a highly trained panel and compounds were identified and quantified using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer. The findings of the study indicate that the differences in sensory characteristics and chemical profiles among stages of growth are more substantial than the differences between organic and conventional production. Green-unripe, musty/earthy, lettuce, and sweet flavors are representative in pac choi at early stages of growth. When older, pac choi has higher intensities of green-grassy/leafy, bitter, cabbage, and sulfur flavors that are associated with the increase of (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, octyl acetate, 1-nonanol, 2-decanone, 1-penten-3-ol, linalool, camphor, menthol, isobornyl acetate, geranylacetone, and cedrol compounds. Conventional pac choi was higher than organic pac choi in green overall, bitter, and soapy flavors only at 2.5 wk of age.

20496185,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) concentrations in the atmosphere and in four vegetable crops including Brassica chinensis L. (bok choy), Brassica campestris L. (field mustard), Vigna unguiculata Walp. (cowpea), and Solanum melongena L. (eggplant) cultivated on land surrounding a plastic production factory were determined. The air DEHP concentrations (means) at the sites 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 km away from the plastic production building were about 9.4-12.8, 5.8-9.6, 1.6-5.0, and 0.04-0.27 microg m(-3) dry weight (DW), respectively. Wind direction is a key factor influencing the measurable DEHP concentration of the air, which was highest in the downwind direction and lowest in the upwind direction, and thus the vegetables accumulated the highest DEHP contents in the downwind direction and the lowest quantities in the upwind direction. The highest DEHP accumulations content of bok choy, field mustard, eggplant, and cowpea were 52.0 +/- 3.1, 43.1 +/- 2.2, 36.2 +/- 2.8, and 19.4 +/- 0.47 mg kg(-1) DW, respectively. Safety estimation on the basis of the daily intake limit referenced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) led to the conclusion that eating vegetables cultivated 0.2 km away from the plastic production building is not a food safety problem under normal conditions. A strong positive linear correlation between atmospheric DEHP concentration and DEHP content of the vegetable crops was found. The limits for air DEHP concentration for safe vegetable cultivation are 24.0, 34.8, 40.8, and 82.8 microg m(-3) for bok choy, field mustard, cowpea, and eggplant, respectively, by calculating from the equation of linear regression between air DEHP concentration and vegetable DEHP content.","Food additives & contaminants.

Phloem exudate was collected from field-grown canola inflorescence stalks by shallow incision, while wheat phloem exudate was collected by aphid stylectomy. Chara cytoplasm was collected by careful manual separation of the cell wall, vacuole, and cytosolic compartments. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed the presence of isotopic borate complexes, at mass-to-charge ratio of 690.22/691.22 in the canola and wheat phloem and at 300.11/301.11 in canola phloem and Chara cytoplasm. Using reference compounds, the borate complexes with mass-to-charge ratio 690.22/691.22 was identified as a bis-sucrose (Suc) borate complex in which the 4,6-hydroxyl pairs from the two alpha-glucopyranoside moieties formed an [L(2)B](-1) complex. Further investigation using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of the bis-Suc borate complex in wheat phloem with a concentration up to 220 microm.

19656903,"Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans but becomes toxic at high dosage. Biologically based Se volatilization, which converts Se into volatile compounds, provides an important means for cleanup of Se-polluted environments. To identify novel genes whose products are involved in Se volatilization from plants, a broccoli (Brassica oleracea var italica) cDNA encoding COQ5 methyltransferase (BoCOQ5-2) in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway was isolated. Its function was authenticated by complementing a yeast coq5 mutant and by detecting increased cellular ubiquinone levels in the BoCOQ5-2-transformed bacteria. BoCOQ5-2 was found to promote Se volatilization in both bacteria and transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Bacteria expressing BoCOQ5-2 produced an over 160-fold increase in volatile Se compounds when they were exposed to selenate. Consequently, the BoCOQ5-2-transformed bacteria had dramatically enhanced tolerance to selenate and a reduced level of Se accumulation. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing BoCOQ5-2 volatilized three times more Se than the vector-only control plants when treated with selenite and exhibited an increased tolerance to Se. In addition, the BoCOQ5-2 transgenic plants suppressed the generation of reactive oxygen species induced by selenite. BoCOQ5-2 represents, to our knowledge, the first plant enzyme that is not known to be directly involved in sulfur/Se metabolism yet was found to mediate Se volatilization.

The results showed that the degradation of the two enantiomers in Chinese cabbage was proved to be enantioselective and followed pseudo first-order kinetics (R(2)⩾0.98). The (R)-enantiomer degraded faster than the (S)-enantiomer, resulting in the relative enrichment of (S)-enantiomer in residue. The detected metabolites MB46513 (desthio), MB45950 (sulfide) and MB46136 (sulfone) by GC-MS suggested that degradation was mainly contributed by oxidization, reduction and photodegradation. Due to the more insecticide activity and lower mammalian toxicity of S-form, the higher concentration of S-fipronil may result in higher activity in crop protection and lower risk to environment and human beings compared to the recemate. This result should be considered in future environmental risk and food safety evaluation.

To further explore the potential of canola protein as value-added food and nutraceutical ingredients, a better understanding of fundamental properties of 2 major canola proteins is necessary. Two major protein components, cruciferin and napin, were isolated from defatted canola meal by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography. SDS-PAGE showed that cruciferin consists of more than 10 polypeptides, and noncovalent links are more important than disulphide bonds in stabilizing the structural conformation. Napin consists of 2 polypeptides and is stabilized primarily by disulphide bonds. Purified cruciferin showed 1 major endothermic peak at 91 degrees C compared with that of 110 degrees C for napin. Emulsion prepared by cruciferin showed significant higher specific surface area and lower particle size than that of napin.

Fermentation products were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and pH was measured during the initial stages of fermentation and after 10 mo storage at 18 degrees C. A trained descriptive sensory panel used category scales to rate the flavor and texture of selected sauerkrauts. A modified Kramer shear test was used to measure firmness. Cabbage fermented with L. mesenteroides consistently resulted in sauerkraut with firm texture and reduced off-flavors across all salt levels (P < 0.05). Conversely, sauerkraut quality was highly variable, with softening and off-flavors occurring as salt concentrations were decreased in natural fermentations (P < 0.05). Fermentations were rapid, with a more uniform decline in pH when starter culture was added.

Selenium translocation and transformation Se species in plants was studied through the Se-speciation in root, stem and fruit. After 40 days of exposure, selenomethionine was the major species found in roots, however, Se-methylselenocysteine was the main species found in the fruit, suggesting Broccoli as a source of this important selenoamino acid in human diet. However, the degree of meal processing influences the stability of Se-aminoacids. Speciation studies in boiled Broccoli and in the extraction water were also carried out. This experiment revealed a noticeable degradation of Se-methylselenocysteine in the boiled Broccoli fruit.

17628261,"Spinosad is an insect control agent that is derived from a naturally occurring soil bacterium, and is effective on several classes of insects, especially Lepidoptera larvae. Spinosad consists mainly of a mixture of spinosyns A and D and is registered for uses on a variety of crops in many countries including China. In order to understand the residue behavior of spinosad and to evaluate the dietary risk of spinosad residue in food in China, a number of residue studies were conducted on cotton, Chinese cabbage and eggplant. Residue detection methods using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection have been validated for the detection of spinosad and its metabolites in cotton, Chinese cabbage and eggplant. The proposed definition of the residue for the estimation of spinosad dietary intake is the sum of spinosyns A and D. According to existing Chinese residue studies, the Supervised Trials Median Residues (STMRs) for cotton seed, Chinese cabbage and eggplant were less than 0.010, 0.103 and 0.045 mg/kg, respectively. Daily intake of spinosad residue in food was calculated by multiplying the pertinent Chinese food consumption data with the STMRs. Establishment of spinosad acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0-0.02 mg/kg bw was based on a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 2.4 mg/kg bw per day and a 100-fold safety factor. Therefore, only 2% of the spinosad ADI is occupied by spinosad dietary daily intake in the Chinese population. The proposed maximum residue limits (MRLs) for spinosad on cotton seed, Chinese cabbage and eggplant are 0.01, 2 and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively. Although the STMRs for cotton and Chinese cabbage are lower or equal to STMRs used by Codex, no STMR for eggplant was used by Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) when dietary risk assessment was carried out for spinosad. If these Chinese residue studies were considered during the Codex risk assessment process, the International Estimate Daily Intakes (IEDIs) of spinosad in the five Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS) regional diets would be 2-30% of the ADI (0-0.02 mg/kg bw). In conclusion, spinosad is unlikely to pose any public health issues not only in China but also in global community, if it is applied according to the good agriculture practices (GAPs) established by each countries.",Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,"['D001937', 'D002681', 'D004034', 'D004338', 'D004784', 'D005247', 'D005506', 'D003368', 'D006801', 'D018942', 'D010573', 'D018570', 'D012639', 'D032323']","['Brassica', 'China', 'Diet Surveys', 'Drug Combinations', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Food Contamination', 'Gossypium', 'Humans', 'Macrolides', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Risk Assessment', 'Seeds', 'Solanum melongena']",Dietary risk assessment of spinosad in China.,"['Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17628261,2008

The mixture of NNK plus BaP (2 micromol each) was administered by gavage as eight weekly doses, whereas I3C (112 micromol/g diet) and DIM (2 and 30 micromol/g diet in experiments 1 and 2, respectively) were given in the diet for 23 weeks beginning at 50% of carcinogen treatment. I3C reduced NNK plus BaP-induced tumor multiplicity by 78% in experiment 1 and 86% in experiment 2; the respective reductions in tumor multiplicity by DIM were 5% and 66%. Using a quantitative proteomics method, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified and quantified at least 250 proteins in lung tissues. Of these proteins, nine showed differences in relative abundance in lung tissues of carcinogen-treated versus untreated mice: fatty acid synthase, transketolase, pulmonary surfactant-associated protein C (SP-C), L-plastin, annexin A1, and haptoglobin increased, whereas transferrin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and apolipoprotein A-1 decreased. Supplementation of the diet of carcinogen-treated mice with I3C reduced the level of SP-C, L-plastin, annexin A1, and haptoglobin to that of untreated controls. These results were verified using immunoblotting.

17562464,"With the public perception that synthetic pesticides leave harmful residues in crop produce for human consumption, there has been increased interest in using natural products for pest control. The potential of using fruit extracts of hot pepper for controlling the cabbage looper, Trichopulsia ni (Hübner) and spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch is explored in this investigation. Crude extracts from fruits of Capsicum chinense, C. frutescens, C. baccatum, and C. annuum, were prepared and tested under laboratory conditions for their insecticidal and acaricidal performance. Mortality was greatest (94%) when fruit extract of accession PI-593566 (C. annuum) was sprayed on larvae of the cabbage looper, while crude extracts of accessions PI-241675 (C. frutescens) and PI-310488 (C. annuum) were repellent to the spider mite. We investigated differences in chemical composition of the crude fruit extracts that may explain the observed differences in mortality and repellency between accessions. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry spectrometric analysis revealed that capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, the pungent components of pepper fruit, were not correlated with toxicity or repellency, indicating that the two capsaicinoids are not likely related to the efficacy of pepper fruit extracts. Major compounds in hot pepper fruit extracts were detected and identified as pentadecanoic acid methyl ester, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, and octadecanoic acid methyl ester. Spectrometric analysis and toxicity to cabbage looper larvae revealed that pentadecanoic acid methyl ester is likely related to cabbage looper mortality. However, the concentration of pentadecanoic acid methyl ester in some accessions was insufficient to explain the observed mortality of cabbage looper and repellency of spider mite. Fruit extracts of accessions PI-593566 (C. annuum) and PI-241675 (C. frutescens) could be useful for managing populations of cabbage loopers and spider mites, which could reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides.

A total of 231 protein spots were identified by LC-MS/MS. These proteins showed that strain MLBPL1 had more proteins with growth phase-dependent expression than REB1, which possesses a more constant expression profile. The proteins with growth phase-dependent expression in REB1 and MLBPL1 were mainly associated with energy metabolism (glycolysis, phosphoketolase pathway and ribose metabolism), all having preferential expression in the early-exponential phase, confirming the use of different carbohydrates simultaneously.

The results of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry revealed that the isolated Chinese cabbage protein was identical to human FK506-binding protein (FKBP). A cDNA encoding FKBP was isolated from a Chinese cabbage leaf cDNA library and named C-FKBP. The open reading frame of the gene encoded a 154-amino acid polypeptide. The amino acid sequence of C-FKBP exhibits striking degrees of identity with the corresponding mouse (61%), human (60%), and yeast (56%) proteins. Genomic Southern blot analyses using the full-length C-FKBP cDNA probe revealed a multigene family in the Chinese cabbage genome. The C-FKBP mRNA was highly expressed in vegetative tissues. We also analyzed the antifungal and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of recombinant C-FKBP protein expressed in Escherichia coli. This protein inhibited pathogenic fungal strains, including Candida albicans, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichoderma viride, whereas it exhibited no activity against E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

Bioavailability is a critical feature in the assessment of the role of micronutrients in human health, and the approaches to this issue include in vitro and in vivo methods. Our aim was to evaluate the bioavailability of carotenoids and tocopherols present in broccoli and to compare in vitro and in vivo approaches. Fourteen apparently healthy volunteers consumed 200 g broccoli once a day for seven days. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and after intervention to determine changes in lutein, beta-carotene, and alpha- and gamma-tocopherol as relevant phytochemicals provided with this vegetable. Broccoli also was subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion to assess changes related to preabsorptive processes. Analytes in serum and at each phase of the digestion were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. During the intervention, the amounts supplied daily ranged from 2.4 to 3.1 mg lutein, 1.4 to 1.8 mg beta-carotene, 4.5 to 6.8 mg alpha-tocopherol, and 0.8 to 1.8 mg gamma-tocopherol. Significant changes in serum in both men and women were observed only for lutein, whereas for gamma-tocopherol a significant change was detected in women. No changes were observed for alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, retinol, the alpha-tocopherol-to-cholesterol ratio, or serum lipids. Using the in vitro model, more than 75% of lutein, beta-carotene, gamma-tocopherol, and alpha-tocopherol remained at the duodenal phase, whereas incorporation into the supernatants accounted for <20% of the initial content in food. Regular consumption of broccoli at dietary levels increased serum concentrations of lutein and gamma-tocopherol without affecting alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene status in serum.

Vegetable samples of Pumpkin leaves (Cucurbita moschata) and Chinese cabbage (Brassica chinensis) were collected from three sites and analysed for their concentrations of the two metals using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The three sites, namely Mazimbu, Kihonda and Towelo are located within a 10 km perimeter. The site selection was based on the anticipated levels of contamination of the water used for irrigation. The results showed that the levels (mg/100g dry weight) ranged from 0.885 to 1.39 for Copper and 0.05 to 0.315 for Lead. The levels of Lead and Copper varied between the vegetable varieties and from site to site. Vegetables from Mazimbu showed higher concentration levels of the two metals compared to the other sites in both varieties. Towelo vegetables had relatively low concentrations. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in levels of the two metals across the sites but there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the levels of Copper between the two vegetable varieties from all the three sites.

17011103,"Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of Brassica vegetables decrease the risk of cancer. These associations are linked to dietary intake of glucosinolates and their metabolism to cancer preventive isothiocyanates. Bioavailability of glucosinolates and related isothiocyanates are influenced by storage and culinary processing of Brassica vegetables. In this work, the content of the 7 major glucosinolates in broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green cabbage and their stability under different storage and cooking conditions is examined. Glucosinolates and isothiocyanates were quantified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS). Isothiocyanates were detected with high sensitivity as the corresponding thiourea derivatives. Storage at ambient temperature and in a domestic refrigerator showed no significant difference and a minor loss (9-26%) of glucosinolate levels over 7 days. Vegetables shredded finely showed a marked decline of glucosinolate level with post-shredding dwell time - up to 75% over 6h. Glucosinolate losses were detected partly as isothiocyanates. Cooking by steaming, microwaving and stir-fry did not produce significant loss of glucosinolates whereas boiling showed significant losses by leaching into cooking water. Most of the loss of the glucosinolates (approximately 90%) was detected in the cooking water.

16931180,"An automated online gel permeation chromatography-gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GPC-GC/MS) was developed for the rapid determination of residual pesticides in agricultural products. Pesticides were extracted from homogenized food samples with acetonitrile and decontaminated via the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) technique, using a primary secondary amine as sorbent prior to GPC-GC/MS analysis. A slightly modified preparation method and automated GPC step proved useful in minimizing matrix interference. To evaluate the performance of the system, 97 target pesticides were spiked at a concentration of 0.1mg/kg into a range of food types, including potato, cabbage, carrot, apple, orange, cucumber, and rice. A low flow rate of 0.1 mL/min in GPC resulted in a 40-fold reduction in solvent consumption compared with conventional GPC column applications. The combination of MSPD technique and GPC-GC/MS for the analysis of the 97 pesticides can be accomplished within 90 min. Most pesticides were recovered in the range of 70-120%, with relative standard deviation generally less than 10%. The results demonstrate that the method can be successfully applied with acceptable recoveries to a broad range of target pesticides within a diverse range of food types.","Journal of chromatography.

16718569,"Recognition of cabbage as a host plant for the diamondback moth (DBM) has previously been shown to depend on compounds that are extracted by soaking intact foliage in chloroform. Analysis of such chloroform extracts by open column chromatography has now resulted in the isolation of highly active fractions that elicit oviposition on treated filter papers. Further separation of these fractions by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of two distinct groups of active compounds that may be classified as volatile and non-volatile. The two prominent volatile components were separated and identified by mass spectrometry as the isothiocyanates, iberin (3-methylsulfinylpropyl isothiocyanate) and sulforaphane (4-methylsulfinyl-3-butenyl isothiocyanate). Subsequent bioassays of a range of isothiocyanates showed that iberin and sulforaphane were the most active of those tested. Other isothiocyanates with sulfur in the side chain were also active, whereas alkyl and phenyl isothiocyanates had only limited activity. In electrophysiological experiments, electroantennograms (EAGs) indicated positive responses of moth antennae to the isothiocyanates that were most active in behavioral assays. Since sulforaphane has been identified as a major inducer of anticarcinogenic activity in mouse tissue, a synthetic analog (exo-2-acetyl-5-isothiocyanatonorbornane) that shows similar inducer activity was tested on DBM.

Surface soil, atmospherically deposited surface films on windows, and leaves of Amaranthus dubius were sampled at known distances from the roads and analyzed for lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd) using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Atmospherically deposited trace metal particulates were sampled using window glass as an inert, passive collector. Total trace metal concentrations in soils ranged from 30.0+/-2.3 to 64.6+/-11.7 mg/kg Pb, 78.4+/-18.4 to 265.6+/-63.2 mg/kg Zn, and 0.8+/-0.13 to 1.40+/-0.16 mg/kg Cd. Total trace metal levels in soil decreased rapidly with distance from the road. Total Pb decreased with distance up to 30 m from the road, where it reached a background soil concentration of 28 mg/kg dry weight. The study found background values of 50 and 1.4 mg/kg for Zn and Cd in roadside soils, respectively. Similarly, Pb concentration in Amaranthus dubius leaves decreased with increasing distance from the road edge. The dominant pathway for Pb contamination was from atmospheric deposition, which was consistent with Pb concentrations in surface films. The mean Pb concentrations in leaves of roadside crops were higher than those in their respective roots, with the highest leaf-to-root ratio observed in the Brassica oleraceae acephala group. The lowest Pb and Zn concentrations were found in the fruit compared to the leaves of the same crops.

Both Type II and Type III were present in non-heat-treated broccoli with floret senescence. HT suppressed the enhancement of all of the isoperoxidase activities.

The K(m) values corresponding to Chl a of Type II and Type III were lower than Type I, and the V(max)/K(m) values corresponding to Chl a of Type II and Type III were higher than Type I. This suggests that both Types II and III could be closely associated with Chl degradation in broccoli florets and that HT might inhibit floret senescence by suppression of isoperoxidase activities.",Journal of plant physiology,"['D001937', 'D002734', 'D003513', 'D035263', 'D005519', 'D006358', 'D007527', 'D009195']","['Brassica', 'Chlorophyll', 'Cycloheximide', 'Flowering Tops', 'Food Preservation', 'Hot Temperature', 'Isoenzymes', 'Peroxidase']",Control of isoperoxidases involved in chlorophyll degradation of stored broccoli (Brassica oleracea) florets by heat treatment.,"['Q000201', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","['enzymology', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16399004,2006

Residues of chlorfenapyr were extracted from soil and cabbage with acetone/water, purified by liquid/liquid partition and chromatographic column, concentrated to a small volume, and then determined by HPLC equipped with UV detector. The mean accuracy of analytical method were 93.3% and 90.6% in soil and cabbage, respectively; the precision (repeatability) in cabbage ranging from 1.7% to 11.8%, in soil ranging from 2.8% to 11.2%; the precision (reproducibility) in cabbage ranged from 2.2% to 12.1%, in soil it ranged from 2.4% to 11.5%. The minimum detectable amount of chlorfenapyr was 0.65 ng, the minimum detectable concentration was 0.0162 mg kg-1. The degradation of chlorfenapyr formulations in soil and cabbage was determined. The results showed that chlorfenapyr nanoformulation and suspension concentration degradation in soil coincided with C=0.2538 e-0.1612t, C=0.537 e-0.1754t, respectively; the half-lives were about 4.3 d and 3.9 d, respectively. Two kinds of chlorfenapyr formulation degradation in cabbage coincided with C=4.0431 e-0.3103t, C=6.9611 e-0.2686t respectively; the half-lives were about 2.2 d and 2.6, d, respectively. When chlorfenapyr formulations were applied according to the double recommended dose, the final residues in cabbage were much lower than the USA EPA's maximum residue limit of 1 mg kg-1 in vegetables. The degradation rate of chlorfenapyr nanoformulation was faster than that of suspension concentration, and the former residue was also less in soil. Therefore, a harvest interval should be more than 5 d, and a dosage of 900 mL/hm2 was suggested for chlorfenapyr suspension concentration, which could be considered as safe to human beings and animals.

16160820,"Resveratrol is a phytoalexin produced in various plants like wine, peanut or pine in response to fungal infection or UV irradiation, but it is absent in members of the Brassicaceae. Moreover, resveratrol and its glucoside (piceid) are considered to have beneficial effects on human health, known to reduce heart disease, arteriosclerosis and cancer mortality. Therefore, the introduction of the gene encoding stilbene synthase for resveratrol production in rapeseed is a tempting approach to improve the quality of rapeseed products. The stilbene synthase gene isolated from grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) was cloned under control of the seed-specific napin promotor and introduced into rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) by Agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation together with a ds-RNA-interference construct deduced from the sequence of the key enzyme for sinapate ester biosynthesis, UDP-glucose:sinapate glucosyltransferase (BnSGT1), assuming that the suppression of the sinapate ester biosynthesis may increase the resveratrol production in seeds through the increased availability of the precursor 4-coumarate. Resveratrol glucoside (piceid) was produced at levels up to 361 microg/g in the seeds of the primary transformants. This value exceeded by far piceid amounts reported from B. napus expressing VST1 in the wild type sinapine background. There was no significant difference in other important agronomic traits, like oil, protein, fatty acid and glucosinolate content in comparison to the control plants. In the third seed generation, up to 616 microg/g piceid was found in the seeds of a homozygous T3-plant with a single transgene copy integrated. The sinapate ester content in this homozygous T3-plant was reduced from 7.43 to 2.40 mg/g.

The health benefits of broccoli are partly associated with secondary plant compounds that have bioactivity; glucosinolates and phenolic acids are two of the most abundant and important in broccoli. In an effort to determine how variety, stress, and production conditions affect the production of these bioactive components broccoli was grown in the greenhouse with and without selenium (Se) fertilization, and in the field under conventional or organic farming procedures and with or without water stress. High-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to separate and identify 12 primary phenolic compounds. Variety had a major effect: There was a preponderance of flavonoids in the Majestic variety, but hydroxycinnamic esters were relatively more abundant in the Legacy variety. Organic farming and water stress decreased the overall production of phenolics. Se fertilization increased glucosinolates in general, and sulforaphane in particular, up to a point; above that Se fertilization decreased glucosinolate production. Organic farming and water stress also decreased glucosinolate production. These data show environmental and genetic variation in phenolics and glucosinolates in broccoli, and warn that not all broccoli may contain all health-promoting bioactive components.

15877880,"Enterolignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) can potentially reduce the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Enterolignans are formed by the intestinal microflora after the consumption of plant lignans. Until recently, only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were considered enterolignan precursors, but now several new precursors have been identified, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol have a high degree of conversion. Quantitative data on the contents in foods of these new enterolignan precursors are not available. Thus, the aim of this study was to compile a lignan database including all four major enterolignan precursors. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in eighty-three solid foods and twenty-six beverages commonly consumed in The Netherlands. The richest source of lignans was flaxseed (301,129 microg/100 g), which contained mainly secoisolariciresinol. Also, lignan concentrations in sesame seeds (29,331 microg/100 g, mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol) were relatively high. For grain products, which are known to be important sources of lignan, lignan concentrations ranged from 7 to 764 microg/100 g. However, many vegetables and fruits had similar concentrations, because of the contribution of lariciresinol and pinoresinol. Brassica vegetables contained unexpectedly high levels of lignans (185-2321 microg/100 g), mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol. Lignan levels in beverages varied from 0 (cola) to 91 microg/100 ml (red wine). Only four of the 109 foods did not contain a measurable amount of lignans, and in most cases the amount of lariciresinol and pinoresinol was larger than that of secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol.

15073045,"Consumption of red meat is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, whereas cruciferous vegetable consumption reduces cancer risk. While the mechanisms remain to be determined, cruciferous vegetables may act by altering the metabolism of carcinogens present in cooked food, such as the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cruciferous vegetable consumption on the metabolism of PhIP in 20 non-smoking Caucasian male subjects. The study consisted of three 12-day phases, namely two periods of avoidance of cruciferous vegetables (phases 1 and 3) and a high cruciferous vegetable diet period (phase 2), when subjects ingested 250 g each of Brussels sprouts and broccoli per day. At the end of each study phase, the subjects consumed a cooked meat meal containing 4.90 microg PhIP and urine samples were collected for up to 48 h. Cruciferous vegetable consumption significantly increased hepatic CYP1A2, as demonstrated by changes in saliva caffeine kinetics. Samples of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(2)-glucuronide (the major urinary metabolite of PhIP in humans), N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(3)-glucuronide and their trideuterated derivatives (to serve as internal standards) were synthesized and a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry method developed for their analysis. In phases 1 and 3, the excretion of N(2)-hydroxy-N(2)-PhIP-glucuronide in 0-48 h urine samples was six times that of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(3)-glucuronide. Cruciferous vegetable consumption significantly increased the urinary excretion of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(2)-glucuronide in 0-48 h urine samples to 127 and 136% of levels observed in phases 1 and 3, respectively. In contrast, the urinary excretion of N(2)-hydroxy-PhIP-N(3)-glucuronide was unchanged. While the urinary excretion of both PhIP metabolites accounted for approximately 39% of the PhIP dose in phases 1 and 3, they accounted for approximately 49% of the dose in phase 2.

One-dimensional gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) resulted in 10-20 visible protein bands in a molecular mass range from 10 to 100 kDa. The main bands were cut out, digested with trypsin, and analysed using tandem mass spectrometry. Fifty bands resulted in amino acid sequence information that was used to perform database similarity searches. Sequences from 30 bands showed high homology to proteins present in databases. Among them, we found mostly peroxidases, but could also identify the lectin-like xylem protein XSP30, a glycine-rich protein, serine proteases, an aspartyl protease family protein, chitinases, and a lipid transfer protein-like polypeptide. Sequence analysis predicted apoplastic secretion signals for all database entries similar to the partial xylem protein sequences. This and the lack of cross-reactivity with phloem protein-specific antibodies suggest that the proteins really originate from the xylem and do not result from phloem contamination. Most of the highly similar proteins probably function in repair and defence reactions. Some of the most abundant proteins (peroxidases, chitinases, serine proteases) were present in xylem exudate of all species analysed, often in more than one band. This indicates an important basic role of these proteins in maintaining xylem function.",Planta,"['D000595', 'D001937', 'D029688', 'D018553', 'D028464', 'D004591', 'D013058', 'D008969', 'D010940', 'D018514', 'D010944', 'D017386', 'D013045']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Brassica', 'Brassica napus', 'Cucumis sativus', 'Cucurbita', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Structures', 'Plants', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity']",Xylem sap protein composition is conserved among different plant species.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15064951,2004

The packaging materials used were oriented polypropylene (OPP), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) containing an ethylene-absorbing sachet. All samples were stored for either 1 week at a constant temperature of 10 degrees C or for 3 days at 4 degrees C, followed by 4 days at 10 degrees C. The atmospheres that developed inside the packaging materials differed significantly. The broccoli samples were analyzed raw and after cooking, with regard to volatile compounds, using gas-phase (headspace) extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC-olfactometry. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), hexanal, 3-cis-hexen-1-ol, nonanal, ethanol, and a group of thiocyanates were selected for a detailed study because these compounds cause off-odor and can be used as indicators of stress. Significant differences were found in the aroma profiles of the broccoli samples relative to the packaging materials used for storage. Storage in OPP (14% O(2), 10.5% CO(2)) resulted in most of the off-odors, while storage in LDPE (6% O(2), 7% CO(2)) and PVC (17.9% O(2), 4% CO(2)) was found to maintain the concentration of DMS, DMDS, and DMTS during storage.

14629898,"The aim of the investigation was to assess a stable isotope method for determining the relative bioavailability of food-derived lutein in humans. Subjects were administered a single dose of deuterium-labeled carotenoids from intrinsically labeled spinach or collard green; 10 mL blood samples were drawn at various time points over a 34 days period. The vegetables had been hydroponically grown using 25 atom-% deuterated water. Lutein molecules in the vegetables were partially deuterated with a highest abundance isotopomer at M(0) + 8 (unlabeled molecular mass, M(0,) plus 8 additional mass units from 8 deuterium atoms in the molecules). This allowed labeled lutein to be distinguished from endogenous lutein in serum samples after consuming the labeled meal. The presence of labeled lutein in the circulation was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface. The quantification of the labeled lutein in serum samples enabled the calculation of the enrichment for each time point after the dose; these values were plotted vs. time to generate absorption-clearance curves for each of the subjects. Area under the curve analyses of four different subjects (integrated over 29 days) yielded serum lutein responses of 128, 145, 149, and 262 microg-day/mg dietary lutein, following an acute dose of spinach containing 15.4, 18.8, 18.8 and 9.8 mg labeled lutein, respectively.

HAs are mutagenic/carcinogenic compounds formed at low levels via the Maillard reaction and a free radical mechanism during cooking of animal tissue. The addition of pure antioxidants or foods containing antioxidants has previously been shown to decrease the amount of HAs formed during cooking. In this study, beefburgers were fried in six different oils: refined olive oil, virgin olive oil, virgin olive oil depleted of phenols, rapeseed oil, virgin olive oil with rosemary extract and refined olive oil with rosemary extract. The content of antioxidative compounds in the virgin olive oil and the rosemary extract was determined. The beefburgers were analysed with regards to 12 different HAs by solid phase extraction and HPLC analysis. MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, PhIP, Harman and Norharman were detected in all beefburgers fried in the different oils, but the relative amounts varied. Frying in virgin olive oil reduced the formation of HAs compared with refined olive oil. This effect is probably due to the content of phenols in the virgin olive oil.

The nitrate () and nitrite () contents of various vegetables (Chinese cabbage, radish, lettuce, spinach, soybean sprouts, onion, pumpkin, green onion, cucumber, potato, carrot, garlic, green pepper, cabbage and Allium tuberosum Roth known as Crown daisy) are reported. Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables. The average nitrite contents in various vegetables were about 0.6 mg kg(-1), and the values were not significantly different among most vegetables. It was observed that nitrate contents in vegetables varied depending on the type of vegetables and were similar to those in vegetables grown in other countries. From the results of our studies and other information from foreign sources, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to establish limits of nitrates contents of vegetables cultivated in Korea due to the co-presence of beneficial elements such as ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol which are known to inhibit the formation of nitrosamine.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000490', 'D001530', 'D001937', 'D002212', 'D002852', 'D004032', 'D006801', 'D007391', 'D007723', 'D009566', 'D009573', 'D019697', 'D031224', 'D012621', 'D013025', 'D013056', 'D006113', 'D014675']","['Allium', 'Belgium', 'Brassica', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Diet', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Korea', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrites', 'Onions', 'Raphanus', 'Seasons', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'United Kingdom', 'Vegetables']",Survey of nitrate and nitrite contents of vegetables grown in Korea.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'adverse effects', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12888387,2003

Both compounds as components of an onion and broccoli extract could readily permeate the enterocytes in the perfused jejunal segment. At the physiologically relevant, dietary concentration tested, the average effective jejunal permeability (Peff) and percentage absorbed (+/- S.D.) were 18.7 +/- 12.6 x 10-4 cm/s and 74 +/- 29% for sulforaphane and 8.9 +/- 7.1 x 10-4 cm/s and 60 +/- 31% for quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside, respectively. Furthermore, a proportion of each compound was conjugated and excreted back into the lumen as sulforaphane-glutathione and quercetin-3'-glucuronide. The capacity of the isolated segment to deconjugate quercetin from quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside during the perfusion was much higher than the beta-glucosidase activity of the preperfusion jejunal contents, indicating that the majority (79-100%) of the beta-glucosidase capacity derives from the enterocytes in situ. Simultaneously, we determined short-term changes in gene expression in exfoliated enterocytes, which showed 2.0 +/- 0.4-fold induction of glutathione transferase A1 (GSTA1) mRNA (p < 0.002) and 2.4 +/- 1.2-fold induction of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) mRNA (p < 0.02). The changes in gene expression were also seen in differentiated Caco-2 cells, where sulforaphane was responsible for induction of GSTA1 and quercetin for induction of UGT1A1.

The availability of added Cu in the soil decreased with incubation time, and had minimal change after 10-12 weeks. After incubated for 12 weeks, about 60% of added Cu was not extractable by DTPA. The same crops were also grown in sand culture to determine their responses to solution Cu. Shoot growth was significantly inhibited at Cu concentrations above 10 mg kg(-1) in the solution or above 150 mg kg(-1) (DTPA-Cu) in the soil. The sensitivity of the crops to Cu toxicity differed among the three vegetable crops. Copper concentration in shoots and edible parts varied with Cu supply levels and type of the vegetables.

Plant tissue and soil extracts were analyzed for the presence of HMX and possible degradative metabolites using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array UV detection (HPLC-UV), micellar electrokinetic chromatography with diode-array UV detection (MEKC-UV), and HPLC with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The pattern of HMX accumulation for alfalfa (Medicago sativa), bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), canola (Brassica rapa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and perennial ryegrass (Loliumperenne) grown in a controlled environment on contaminated soil from an anti-tank firing range was similar to that observed for plants (wild bergamot (Monarda fistulosa), western wheat grass (Agropyron smithii), brome grass (Bromus sitchensis), koeleria (Koeleria gracilis), goldenrod (Solidago sp.), blueberry (Vaccinium sp.), anemone (Anemone sp.), common thistle (Circium vulgare), wax-berry (Symphoricarpos albus), western sage (Artemisia gnaphalodes), and Drummond's milk vetch (Astragalus drummondii)) collected from the range. No direct evidence of plant-mediated HMX (bio)chemical transformation was provided by the available analytical methods. Traces of mononitroso-HMX were found in contaminated soil extracts and were also observed in leaf extracts. The dominant mechanism for HMX translocation and accumulation in foliar tissue was concluded to be aqueous transpirational flux and evaporation.

After a cell breakdown of the eatable parts and centrifugation of the resulting homogenates all supernatants (cytosols) were separated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The size-range of the GPC method used was about 20-8000 kDa for globular proteins. The high molecular weight (HMW-Cd-SP, 150-700 kDa) and the low molecular weight Cd species (LMW-Cd-SP, < 150 kDa) in all plant cytosols eluted at about the same retention volume by GPC. The most important Cd binding form in the cytosols of all plants was found to be HMW-Cd-SP. The Cd elution maxima were detected in the range of about 200 kDa. The Cd determinations were performed with ET-AAS by means of matrix modifier. By incubating chosen cytosols with a proteinase before the GPC it was verified that the HMW-Cd-SP in both vegetables are Cd proteins. The molar proportions protein/Cd were about 2-6 in the respective GPC fractions of the HMW-Cd-SP of the highest contaminated plants. The GPC fractions of the HMW-Cd-SP of spinach and radish were further separated by a preparative, native and continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) method. At pH 8 the species were negatively charged, had only a small UV-absorption at 280 nm and showed a very similar elution behavior in all analyzed cytosols.

Decreased food intake and body weight gain, and increased lung weight and atherogenic index by feeding the rats on a diet containing paraquat were clearly suppressed by supplementing acylated anthocynins to the paraquat diet. Paraquat feeding increased the concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in liver lipids, and decreased the liver triacylglycerol level. These effects tended to be suppressed by supplementing acylated anthocynins to the paraquat diet. In addition, the catalase activity in the liver mitochondrial fraction was markedly decreased by feeding on the paraquat diet, this decrease being partially suppressed by supplementing the paraquat diet with acylated anthocyanins. An increase in the NADPH-cytochrome-P450-reductase activity in the liver microsome fraction by paraquat was suppressed by supplementing the paraquat diet with acylated anthocyanins. These results suggest that acylated anthocyanins from red cabbage acted preventively against the oxidative stress in vivo that may have been due to active oxygen species formed through the action of paraquat.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","['D000215', 'D000818', 'D000872', 'D001937', 'D002374', 'D002851', 'D002149', 'D050356', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D008956', 'D018384', 'D010269', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D017392', 'D015430']","['Acylation', 'Animals', 'Anthocyanins', 'Brassica', 'Catalase', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Energy Intake', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Paraquat', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances', 'Weight Gain']",Preventive effects of dietary cabbage acylated anthocyanins on paraquat-induced oxidative stress in rats.,"[None, None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, None, 'pharmacology', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10993144,2001

Another small (5-6 kDa) polypeptide was also separated, and purified to homogeneity. Mass spectroscopy yielded its molecular weight to be 5942 +/- 10. This polypeptide had an N-terminal sequence homologous to those of previously reported 5-kDa subunits from spinach and wheat and a 6.1-kDa subunit of Chlamydomonas, which had all been assigned to Photosystem II (PSII) and designated as PsbW. However, we found similar 5-kDa polypeptides with highly conserved N-terminal sequences ubiquitously in PSI particles from other plants including Daikon (Raphanus sativus, Japanese radish), Chingensai (Brassica parachinensis, Chinese cabbage), parsley and Shungiku (Chrysanthemum coronarium, Garland chrysanthemum) as well. Preparations of spinach PSI particles prepared by using a mild detergent (digitonin) had this 5-kDa subunit, while PSII particles did not. Moreover, a bare-bone PSI reaction center preparation consisting of PsaA/B alone had a more than stoichiometric amount of this 5-kDa polypeptide. A mechanically (without detergent) fractionated stroma thylakoid preparation from Phytolacca americana, which lacked other PSII subunits, also contained this 5-kDa subunit.

10858697,"This paper reports the compilation of a food composition database for phylloquinone (vitamin K1) derived from the direct analysis of foods, recipe calculation and the assignment of values based on food similarities. All the basic and other food items used in these calculations had been analysed by HPLC and about 170 of the items had been obtained and assayed in the UK. Recipe calculations took account of the cooking method and changes in water and fat content. Currently, approximately 1501 food items with Royal Society of Chemistry/Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food food codes have been allocated a vitamin K1 value, and a further 282 new recipe codes are included in the database. Representative values from each food group are reported together with an indication of the potential variation. Detailed examples of some recipe calculations are included, and also the impact of changing the type of fat in recipes. Vitamin K1 is associated with, and most abundant in, photosynthetic tissues of plants. Accordingly, the highest concentrations (3000-6000 micrograms/kg) are found in dark-green leafy vegetables and herbs, such as kale, parsley, spinach and green cabbage. Intermediate concentrations (1000-2000 micrograms/kg) are found in plants with paler leaves such as white cabbage and lettuce or in green, non-leafy vegetables such as broccoli and brussel sprouts. Fats and oils contain variable amounts of vitamin K1 with the highest concentrations (300-1300 micrograms/kg) in soyabean, rapeseed and olive oils and the margarines based on them. Other foods such as dairy products, meat dishes and cereal-based foods (bread, biscuits, cakes, desserts etc.), although not in themselves particularly rich in vitamin K1 (< 200 micrograms/kg), may contribute significantly to intakes when consumption of green vegetables is poor.

The derived parameters include the deposition rate and the root uptake rate, information for tillage, the logistic growth model and radionuclide concentrations in vegetables. The dynamic food chain model is solved by the Birchall-James algorithm to give the 137Cs concentration in subsurface soil, from the 0.1-25 cm soil layer, and the 137Cs concentration in harvested and unwashed vegetables.

The method involves extraction of the toxins with an acidified mixture of acetonitrile: aqueous potassium chloride solution, followed by liquid-liquid extraction and further purification using gel permeation chromatography. The final extract is then examined on a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic gradient system with both fluorescence and UV detection. The average recoveries found were 94, 84, 109, 85, 66 and 93% for spiked oilseed rape meal samples and 91, 89, 96, 75, 61 and 102% for spiked sunflower meal samples with limits of determination of about 40, 50, 50, 40, 350 and 200 micrograms/kg for the above toxins, respectively.

We analyzed whether CFBPases from different phylogenetic origin contain a common epitope. To this end a DNA fragment of 1200 base pairs encoding 338 amino acid residues of wheat CFBPase (38 kDa) was cloned in the expression plasmid pGEX-1 in frame with the gene coding for glutathione S-transferase (GT) of Schistosoma japonicun (26.5 kDa). Upon transformation of Escherichia coli and induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, centrifugation of the lysate partitioned 10% of the fusion protein in the supernatant fraction and the remaining 90% in the precipitate. The expected 65 kDa protein was purified from both the soluble and the particulate fraction by affinity chromatography on columns of glutathione-agarose. This fusion protein was successfully used to produce a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognized the CFBPase region of the fusion protein but not the GT moiety. Moreover, the monoclonal antibody immunoreacted not only with polypeptides (ca. 40 kDa) present in leaf crude extracts of other varieties of wheat (Triticum spelta, T. aestivum and T. durum), but also with homogeneous preparations of the spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) enzymes.

In the present study, these important zinc compounds are further investigated. The determinations of the metal are performed by ET-AAS. The zinc complexes of all vegetables are anionic at pH 8.0 and show similar elution behaviour in gel permeation and anion exchange chromatography. Consequently, a great resemblance in structure between the low molecular weight zinc species from the different vegetables can be supposed. Exemplary, the zinc complexes of kohlrabi and Chinese cabbage are further examined. In more purified samples of these vegetables compared to zinc neither stoichiometric amounts of free protein amino acids nor nicotianamine, free malic acid, citric acid or phytic acid have been detected. Mainly glutamic acid is found in molar excess to zinc after acid hydrolysis in both cases. The cysteine contents of both zinc-binding fractions are very low. Conclusively, the well-known gamma-glutamylcysteinyl-glycines (phytochelatines) can not be responsible for the bonding of zinc in both ordinary vegetables.

The epicuticular wax constitutes almost 20% of the chloroform-extractable lipids in developing leek leaf and is derived predominantly from saturated fatty acids. The significant requirement for saturated fatty acids in epidermal tissues led us to investigate whether or not epidermal extracts have thioesterase activities that prefer saturated acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) substrates, rather than the 18:1-ACP more commonly hydrolyzed by total leaf extracts. Epidermal extracts from Brassica, pea, and leek exhibited higher activities toward saturated acyl-ACPs relative to 18:1-ACP when compared to total leaf or leaf parenchymal extracts. We identified and purified a stearoyl-ACP (18:0-ACP)-specific thioesterase from leek epidermal extracts which could be separated from 18:1-ACP thioesterase using hydroxyapatite chromatography. The stearoyl-ACP thioesterase exhibited a high preference for 18:0-ACP, having less than 10% of the 18:0-ACP hydrolyzing activity when presented with 18:1-ACP, 16:0-ACP, or 18:0-CoA substrates.

8000299,"Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is a constituent of cruciferous vegetables. It occurs widely in the human diet as a natural ingredient or food additive. AITC possesses numerous biochemical and physiological activities. It is cytotoxic and tumorigenic at high doses and also is a modulator of enzymes involved in metabolism of xenobiotics, including carcinogens. It is plausible that the wide consumption of dietary AITC may have profound effects on human health. To facilitate investigations of the effects of dietary AITC in humans, a method of measuring its uptake is needed. In this study, a urinary marker was developed for quantifying AITC uptake in humans. Four adult volunteers were asked to eat a meal containing brown mustard as the source of AITC. The 48-h urine samples were collected from these individuals and analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. A major urinary metabolite was found, which was identified as N-acetyl-S-(N-allylthiocarbamoyl)-L-cysteine, the N-acetylcysteine conjugate of AITC, by comparing its retention time and UV, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectra with those of the synthetic standard. After ingestion of mustard, the AITC conjugate was detected in urine collected from 0 to 12 h. No conjugate was found in urine samples collected after 12 h. The major portion of this metabolite was excreted within 8 h. The average total excretion of AITC conjugate was 5.4 +/- 1.7 (SD) mg after consumption of 10 g of mustard and 12.8 +/- 2.0 mg when 20 g of mustard was consumed. Thus, a dose-dependent excretion of this metabolite was demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology","['D000111', 'D000328', 'D015415', 'D002851', 'D003545', 'D004032', 'D004305', 'D005260', 'D005520', 'D006801', 'D017879', 'D009682', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D009149', 'D010946', 'D013056', 'D013859', 'D013997']","['Acetylcysteine', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cysteine', 'Diet', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Food Preservatives', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mustard Plant', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Thiocarbamates', 'Time Factors']",Identification and quantification of the N-acetylcysteine conjugate of allyl isothiocyanate in human urine after ingestion of mustard.,"['Q000302', None, 'Q000652', 'Q000379', 'Q000031', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000302', None]","['isolation & purification', None, 'urine', 'methods', 'analogs & derivatives', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'isolation & purification', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8000299,1995

R., and Ravel, J. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11228-11232). One form, designated eIF-4F, is a complex containing two subunits, p220 and p26. The other form, designated eIF-(iso)4F, is a complex containing two subunits, p82 and p28, which are antigenically distinct from the subunits of eIF-4F. Both the p26 subunit of eIF-4F and the p28 subunit of eIF-(iso)4F are m7G cap-binding proteins. In this investigation, affinity-purified antibodies to the p220 and p26 subunits of wheat germ eIF-4F and to the p82 and p28 subunits of wheat germ eIF-(iso)4F were used to determine if isozyme forms of eIF-4F are present in maize and cauliflower. Extracts from wheat germ, maize root tips, and cauliflower inflorescences were partially purified by adsorption on m7GTP-Sepharose and elution with m7GTP (MGS eluate). Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies to the subunits of the wheat germ factors showed that the MGS eluate from maize contains polypeptides that react with antibodies to the p82 and p28 subunits of wheat eIF-(iso)4F, as well as polypeptides that react with antibodies to the p220 and p26 subunits of wheat eIF-4F. The MGS eluate from cauliflower also contains polypeptides that reacted with antibodies to the subunits of wheat eIF-(iso)4F. These results indicate that both maize and cauliflower contain the isozyme form of eIF-4F.

The native protein was monomeric with a molecular mass of 56 kilodaltons as estimated by analytical gel filtration. The enzyme displayed a broad pH optimum of about pH 5.6 and was relatively heat stable. Western blots of microgram quantities of the final preparation showed no cross-reactivity when probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies prepared against either castor bean endosperm cytosolic pyruvate kinase, or sorghum leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The final preparation exhibited a broad substrate selectivity, showing high activity toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, gluconate 6-phosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvate, and moderate activity toward several other organic phosphates. Phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase possessed at least a fivefold and sixfold greater affinity and specificity constant, respectively, for phosphoenolpyruvate (apparent Michaelis constant = 50 micromolar) than for any other nonartificial substrate. The enzyme was activated 1.7-fold by 4 millimolar magnesium, but was strongly inhibited by molybdate, fluoride, zinc, copper, iron, and lead ions, as well as by orthophosphate, ascorbate, glutamate, aspartate, and various organic phosphate compounds. It is postulated that phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase functions to bypass the adenosine diphosphate dependent pyruvate kinase reaction during extended periods of orthophosphate starvation.",Plant physiology,[],[],Purification and Characterization of a Phosphoenolpyruvate Phosphatase from Brassica nigra Suspension Cells.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16666836,2010
2708275,"Experimental data comparing the alkali extraction/ion exclusion chromatographic method with the Monier-Williams method for determination of total sulfite are presented in (a) enzymatic and nonenzymatic browning systems, (b) vegetables containing naturally occurring sulfite, and (c) a carbohydrate-type food additive, erythorbic acid. Excellent agreement, with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.99, was observed in fresh potato samples homogenized with sulfite and allowed to react for different time intervals (enzymatic browning system). A good overall correlation was observed in dehydrated, sulfited apple samples heated for different times (nonenzymatic browning system); however, as heating time increased, higher results were obtained by the Monier-Williams method than by the alkali extraction/ion exclusion chromatographic method. The results of determining sulfite in the alkali trapping solution following acid distillation or acid treatment without heat suggested that this deviation was due to a fraction of sulfite bound to the browning reaction products in such a way that it was released by acid distillation but not by alkali extraction or acid treatment without heat. Similar behavior was demonstrated in cabbage with naturally occurring sulfite, which was released by acid distillation but not by alkali extraction or acid treatment without heat. The ion exclusion chromatographic method could overcome interference by the volatile caramelization reaction products in the Monier-Williams determination of erythorbic acid.",Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,"['D001937', 'D002845', 'D005504', 'D007477', 'D013447']","['Brassica', 'Chromatography', 'Food Analysis', 'Ions', 'Sulfites']",Comparison of the ion exclusion chromatographic method with the Monier-Williams method for determination of total sulfite in foods.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2708275,1989
16664325,"The enzyme, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.50), has been demonstrated in leaves of Chinese cabbage, (Brassica pekinensis var Pak Choy). All of the enzyme can be found in extracts of the protoplasts obtained from the leaves of growing healthy or virus-infected cabbage. The protein has been purified approximately 1500-fold in several steps involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity chromatography, and Sephacryl S-300 filtration. The reaction catalyzed by the purified enzyme has been shown to lead to the equimolar production of CO(2) and of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dSAM). The K(m) for SAM is 38 micromolar. The reaction is not stimulated by Mg(++) or putrescine, and is inhibited by dSAM competitively with SAM. It is also inhibited strongly by methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). The enzyme, spermidine synthase (EC 2.5.1.16), present in leaf or protoplast extracts in many fold excess over SAM decarboxylase, has been purified approximately 1900-fold in steps involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity chromatography, and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. Standardization of the Sephacryl column by proteins of known molecular weight yielded values of 35,000 and 81,000 for the decarboxylase and synthase, respectively.",Plant physiology,[],[],S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and spermidine synthase from chinese cabbage.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16664325,2010
3871719,"After an initial equilibration period of 7 days on a semi-synthetic basal diet, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed for 2 wk on either the basal diet (controls), the basal diet containing 5% Schizandra chinensis or 25% Brussels sprouts, or on rat chow. One group of chow-fed rats was pretreated with 20 mg 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC)/kg body weight, 24 hr before they were killed. Microsomal and cytosolic fractions were prepared from small intestine mucosa. Microsomes were assayed for cytochrome P-450, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH), ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECD) and epoxide hydrolase (EH) activities, and for metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), Cytosols were assayed for glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. The largest increase in intestinal mixed-function oxidase activity over levels in the controls was seen in the 3-MC-treated group. However, EH and GST activities in these animals were not significantly increased. Increases in cytochrome P-450 levels and significant increases in AHH, ECD, EH and GST activities occurred in the rats fed Brussels sprouts. Rats in the S. chinensis group showed inhibition of AHH activity relative to controls, but increased activity of ECD, EH and GST. In the rats fed chow there were significant increases in the activities of all the enzymes assayed except GST. The percentage conversion of BaP to metabolites reflected the results of the AHH assay and the groups were ranked in the following order: 3-MC greater than Brussels sprouts greater than rat chow greater than basal diet greater than S. chinensis. The profile of BaP metabolites showed a larger proportion of the BaP diols and 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene, and a smaller proportion of BaP-4,5-epoxide and the BaP quinones, for the Brussels sprouts- and S. chinensis-fed groups. The significance of these results is discussed in regard to the role of the small intestine as a mediator of toxicity induced by ingested chemicals.",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"['D015660', 'D000818', 'D001189', 'D001564', 'D001937', 'D002851', 'D003577', 'D004032', 'D004851', 'D005982', 'D006128', 'D007413', 'D007421', 'D008297', 'D006899', 'D009929', 'D010105', 'D010946', 'D051381', 'D011919']","['7-Alkoxycoumarin O-Dealkylase', 'Animals', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Brassica', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Diet', 'Epoxide Hydrolases', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Growth', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestine, Small', 'Male', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', 'Organ Size', 'Oxygenases', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",The effects of dietary brussels sprouts and Schizandra chinensis on the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes of the rat small intestine.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000201', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'enzymology', 'drug effects', None, 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3871719,1985
16662073,"NAD-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.39) was obtained from isolated mitochondria of cauliflower buds (Brassica oleracea L., var. botrytis). The NAD-linked activity is accompanied by a minor NADP-linked activity. Some contaminant NADP-malic enzyme from the supernatant and the plasma membrane is usually present in crude mitochondrial preparations. NAD-dependent malic enzyme has been purified 38-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation and gel permeation chromatography, to a specific activity up to 2 micromoles per minute per milligram.The nature of the activating effect of coenzyme A and dithiothreitol has been investigated. Both compounds act by decreasing the apparent Michaelis constants for l-malate and NAD(+) (and NADP(+)), V(max) remaining approximately constant. However, enzyme fully activated by dithiothreitol can still be stimulated up to 2.4-fold by coenzyme A treatment.Velocity versus substrate responses show hyperbolic kinetics under present assay conditions (pH 7.5, 2 millimolar Mn(2+)), but biphasic kinetics have been observed with enzyme purified in the presence of 10 millimolar dithiothreitol, suggesting enzyme heterogeneity with respect to an activated state. This condition is reverted to linearity by treatment with coenzyme A. K(m) values do not vary with changing concentrations of the second substrate. Enzyme molecular weight is 400,000 in the completely activated state and 200,000 in the ;inactivated' state; intermediate forms are also found. All coenzyme A derivatives tested are effective activators, showing activation constants lower than for coenzyme A itself.
