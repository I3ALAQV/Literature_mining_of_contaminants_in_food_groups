35325205,"Nucleus-encoded circular RNAs (ncircRNAs) have been widely detected in eukaryotes, and most circRNA identification algorithms are designed to identify them. However, using these algorithms, few mitochondrion-encoded circRNAs (mcircRNAs) have been identified in plants, and the role of plant mcircRNAs has not yet been addressed. Here, we developed a circRNA identification algorithm, mitochondrion-encoded circRNA identifier (MeCi), based on common features of plant mitochondrial genomes. We identified 7,524, 9,819, 1,699, 1,821, 1,809, and 5,133 mcircRNAs in maize (Zea mays), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), and grape (Vitis vinifera), respectively. These mcircRNAs were experimentally validated. Plant mcircRNAs had distinct characteristics from ncircRNAs, and they were more likely to be derived from RNA degradation but not intron backsplicing. Alternative circularization was prevalent in plant mitochondria, and most parental genomic regions hosted multiple mcircRNA isoforms, which have homogenous 5' termini but heterogeneous 3' ends. By analysis of mitopolysome and mitoribosome profiling data, 1,463 mcircRNAs bound to ribosomes were detected in maize and Arabidopsis. Further analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data identified 358 mcircRNA-derived polypeptides. Overall, we developed a computational pipeline that efficiently identifies plant mcircRNAs, and we demonstrated mcircRNAs are widespread and translated in plants.",Plant physiology,[],[],Mitochondrion-encoded circular RNAs are widespread and translatable in plants.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35325205,2022
35298847,"Mold growth reduces the quality of stored grains, besides producing toxins that pose a potential threat to human health. Therefore, prevention of grain mold growth during storage is important to ensure a safe and high-quality product, preferably using an eco-friendly antifungal agent. The Puroindoline (PIN) protein was extracted by Triton X-114, and identified by QE mass spectrometry. A. flavus has attracted much attention because of its toxic secondary metabolites, and PIN protein showed a significant inhibition on A. flavus growth. Scanning electron microscopy revealed altered spore morphology of A. flavus following PIN protein treatment, and propidium iodide staining showed incomplete spore cell membranes. The disruption and deformation of A. flavus spores suggest that the cell walls and cell membranes were compromised. Decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected using JC-1 and 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining, respectively. PIN protein could effectively inhibit the growth and aflatoxins B1 production of A. flavus in stored grains, such as wheat and rice. PIN proteins can inhibit the growth of many common grain storage molds, including Penicillium, Aspergillus spp. (A. flavus, A. glaucus, A. kawachii, A. ochraceus, A. niger), Alternaria, and Fusarium graminearum, in a dose-dependent manner.

35189242,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil is a key factor affecting the bioavailability of heavy metals, but very few studies have focused on the role of DOM in the use of soil amendments to mitigate heavy metal accumulation in crops. Here, eleven materials were added to cadmium (Cd)-contaminated paddy soil in greenhouse pot trials; rice was grown and harvested, the chemodiversity of post-harvest soil DOM was characterized using Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry, and the specific associations between soil DOM traits and water-extractable soil Cd concentration were identified at the molecular level. The results showed that the endogenous release caused by altering soil pH had a greater effect on soil DOM concentration than did the exogenous chemical input due to the application of organic amendments, which in turn contributed to the chemodiversity of DOM. After one season of rice cultivation, soil DOM molecules were mainly dominated by relatively low molecular weight heteroatom-free lignins. C/N, C/H ratios of organic materials influenced DOM molecular fingerprint patterns, and soil pH and redox potential were the main driving forces affecting the chemodiversity of DOM. Furthermore, the low molecular weight, high saturation, low aromaticity, and heteroatom-free DOM molecules are more likely to dissolve Cd from the soil solid phase, thus increasing the potential risk of Cd to the environment. The results provide critical information about amendments-induced changes in DOM chemodiversity and will inform the selection of appropriate soil amendments.",The Science of the total environment,[],[],Chemodiversity of dissolved organic matter in cadmium-contaminated paddy soil amended with different materials.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35189242,2022

In the present study, comparative evaluation of 10 commercially available ligands for formation of Cd(II)-ligand complex and determination of cadmium in rice samples by ultrasound-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (UADLLME) combined with FAAS was developed. Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) provided a high distribution coefficient as well as a good absorbance signal, therefore DDTC was used as a ligand in UADLLME. A low density and less toxic solvent, 1-heptanol, was used as the extraction solvent and ethanol was used as the disperser solvent. In addition, the experimental conditions of UADLLME were optimized in standard solution first and then applied in rice, such as the type and volume of extractant and dispersant, pH, extraction time, and temperature. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the detection limit (3σ) was 0.69 μg/L for Cd(II). The proposed method was applied for the determination of Cd(II) in three different rice samples (polished rice, brown rice, and glutinous rice), the recovery test was carried out, and the results ranged between 96.7 to 113.6%.

However, the effects of geological background on distributions of heavy metals and their accumulation in plant remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the distributions of mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) in 1036 corn and rice samples collected from 9 locations in Guizhou province and to evaluate their health risks. The concentrations of Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Cr and Cu in these two crops were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and their health risk were estimated by the target risk quotient approaches. Results showed that the mean concentrations of Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Cr and Cu in corn and rice were 0.01, 0.07, 0.06, 0.27, 0.56 and 1.86 mg/kg which were lower than their respective maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) of 0.02, 0.20, 0.70, 0.20, 0.50 and 10.00 mg/kg except Pb and Cr. The concentrations of Cr and Cu in corn were higher than in rice while Cd, As and Pb in rice were higher than in corn. Moreover, the distributions of Hg, Cd and Cu in corn and rice samples were mainly observed from QDN located at southeast of Guizhou province while Pb, As and Cr were most detected at ZY, QXN and BJ areas, southwest zone. The hazard indices (HIs) values for corn and rice were 0.20 and 2.61.

35084595,"Seed deterioration during rice seed storage can lead to seed vigor loss, which adversely affects agricultural production, the long-term preservation of germplasm resources, and the conservation of species diversity. However, the mechanisms underlying seed vigor maintenance remain largely unknown. In this study, 16 hybrid rice combinations were created using four sterile lines and four restorer lines that have been widely planted in southern China. Following artificial aging and natural aging treatments, germination percentage and metabolomics analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify the metabolite markers that could accurately reflect the degree of aging of the hybrid rice seeds. Significant differences in the degree of seed deterioration were observed among the 16 hybrid rice combinations tested, with each hybrid combination having a different germination percentage after storage. The hybrid rice combination with the storage-resistant restorer line Guanghui122 exhibited the highest germination percentage under both natural and artificial storage. A total of 89 metabolic peaks and 56 metabolites were identified, most of which were related to primary metabolism. Interestingly, the content of galactose, gluconic acid, fructose and glycerol in the seeds increased significantly during the aging process. Absolute quantification indicated that galactose and gluconic acid were highly significantly negatively correlated with the germination percentage of the seeds under the different aging treatments. The galactose content was significantly positively correlated with gluconic acid content. Additionally, glycerol showed a significant negative correlation with the germination percentage in most hybrid combinations. Based on the metabolomics analysis, metabolite markers that could accurately reflect the aging degree of hybrid rice seeds were identified. Galactose and gluconic acid were highly significantly negatively correlated with the germination percentage of the seeds, which suggested that these metabolites could constitute potential metabolic markers of seed vigor and aging.

Pesticides are often utilized to minimize crop losses due to pest infestations; however, problems arise when these chemicals are transported off production acreage, either by storm or irrigation events, and into nearby water bodies. Innovative management practices are needed to not only reduce the volume of runoff, but also to mitigate various pollutants, such as pesticides, within the runoff. One such practice being evaluated involves using rice (Oryza sativa) as a pesticide mitigation tool. While rice plants may serve as a mechanism for phytoremediation, whether the seeds harvested from exposed plants could then be utilized as a human food source is an unanswered question.

The objective was to compare the distribution of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in African rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) and Asian rice (O. sativa L.). It is hypothesized that increased mineral accumulation and greater stress tolerance in O. glaberrima will affect the uptake and distribution of THg and MeHg, compared to O. sativa. Rice varieties from the Republic of Mali, including O. glaberrima (n =1) and O. sativa (n = 2), were cultivated in a greenhouse, in mercury-spiked soil (50 mg/kg) (n =3 replicates/variety). THg and MeHg concentrations were analyzed in the grain (brown rice), and the THg distribution was analyzed using laser ablation inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). THg and MeHg concentrations did not differ between O. glaberrima and O. sativa grain. However, in both O. sativa varieties, THg was highly concentrated in the scutellum, which surrounds the embryo and is removed during polishing. Conversely, in O. glaberrima grain, THg was widely distributed throughout the endosperm, the edible portion of the grain. Differences in the THg distribution in O. glaberrima grain, compared to O. sativa, may elevate the risk of mercury exposure through ingestion of polished rice.

Increased environmental pollution generates a large amount of waste that, in many cases, is discarded close to culture fields. Some species are able to bioaccumulate toxic substances, such as metals, that could be transferred to the food chain. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the content of metallic (Al, Cd, Pb, and Cr) and metalloid elements (As) in 14 of the most consumed varieties of rice in Spain and their effects on human health. The samples were cooked, and human digestion was simulated by using a standard in vitro digestion method. Metallic and metalloid element levels were analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES), previous called microwave digestion. Both the human health risk index, Hazard Quotient, and Lifetime Cancer Risk did not show toxic values in any case. Rice with a higher non-digestible fraction showed a higher liberation of proteins and a lower glycemic index. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of metallic and metalloid elements in cooked rice or in the digestible fraction in all varieties analysed. However, Al concentrations were higher than other metals in all varieties studied due to its global distribution. No relationship has been observed between the digestibility of rice and the bioaccessibility of each metallic and metalloid element. All of the studied rice varieties are healthy food products and its daily consumption is safe. The regular monitoring of metals and As in rice consumed in Spain may contribute to improvements in the human health risk evaluation.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Nutritional Quality of the Most Consumed Varieties of Raw and Cooked Rice in Spain Submitted to an In Vitro Digestion Model.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34828863,2021

Field evidence indicates that elevated temperature during rice grain-filling leads to the further deterioration of grain quality. In order to clarify the potential regulatory mechanism of elevated temperature on the formation of rice quality, the DIA mass spectrometry method under the background of field warming was conducted to investigate the regulatory effects of high temperature on grain development and material accumulation pathways. The results showed that a total of 840 differentially expressed proteins were identified during the grain-filling process under elevated temperature. These differentially expressed proteins participated in carbon metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, signal transduction, protein synthesis, and alternately affected the material accumulation of rice grains. The significant up-regulation of PPROL 14E, PSB28, granule-bound starch synthase I, and the significant down-regulation of 26.7 kDa heat shock protein would lead to the component difference in grain starch and storage proteins, and that could be responsible for the degradation of rice quality under elevated temperature. Results suggested that proteins specifically expressed under elevated temperature could be the key candidates for elucidating the potential regulatory mechanism of warming on rice development and quality formation.

34677020,"Starch occurs naturally in the form of semicrystalline granules, and is composed of two types of carbohydrate molecules, amylose (AM) and amylopectin (AP). Starch granules and starch molecules have sizes in the range of 1-100 μm and 20-250 nm, respectively; these size ranges are among the key factors affecting the functional properties of starch. Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) is a size-based separation technique. The major difference between AF4 and dynamic light scattering or microscopy techniques is that AF4 enables the separation of particles based on their size; consequently, the elution profile can be converted to the size distribution of the samples. In the last two decades, AF4 systems, when coupled online with multiangle light scattering (MALS) and differential refractive index (dRI) detectors (AF4-MALS-dRI), have demonstrated to be applicable for the size characterization of starch at the molecular level. Unlike size exclusion chromatography (SEC), AF4 systems use an open channel that does not require a stationary phase or packing materials. Thus, the shear scission of AP molecules during AF4 separation is minimized. The size detection range of a commercial AF4 system ranges from 1 nm to 10 μm, which is smaller than the size range of starch granules. In this study, a home-made AF4 system was developed, and its capability for the size characterization of starch granules extracted from sweet potato, lotus seed, and rice was investigated. The performance of the developed AF4 system was evaluated by running a mixture of polystyrene (PS) with diameter of 2, 6, 12, and 20 μm, respectively. Baseline separation of four PS samples was achieved, and the resolution for 6 μm PS and 12 μm PS was 1.40. The detection limit of the developed AF4 system was higher than that of commercial AF4 systems. Thus, the developed AF4 system is promising for the separation and characterization of starch granules. The effect of the composition of the carrier liquid on the AF4 separation of starch granules was also studied. Moreover, the accuracy of AF4 in terms of size characterization of the starch granules was evaluated by optical microscopy (OM). The results revealed that the type of dispersant and viscosity of the carrier liquid affect the accuracy of size characterization of the starch granules.

34600685,"Food authenticity relies on genuineness and reliability according to the information displayed on the package. Since the 18th century, when coffee became popularized in the West, adulteration began. Several methods have been developed to detect different kinds of frauds and they have evolved as demands increased and new technologies were introduced. The evolution of the science of coffee authenticity control in the past three centuries is reviewed, focusing on the discrimination between coffee and other foods or between coffee and its by-products. The earliest chemical and physical methods are presented followed by methods developed in the 20th and 21st centuries using microscopy, chromatography and spectroscopy associated with advanced statistical tools, and DNA-based methods. In addition to non-food material, before the 20th century, chicory was the most studied food-adulterant. From the 20th century on, corn, coffee by-products, and barley were the most studied, followed by chicory, rice and other food items. Matrix effects seem to be among the most challenging problems in these approaches, associated with variations in roast degree, particle size (particularly in spectroscopy-based methods), and lack of control over reference samples regarding species and purity. Limits of detection vary considerably within each category, with most limits being too high for commercial use. DNA-based methods appear to be promising to assess coffee authenticity, given that the limits of detection and quantification are low, and specificity is higher than in other methods. Nevertheless, as roast intensity increases, the sensitivity of the method decreases. So far, most reported methods have not been validated and only a few have been tested on commercial brands, except for those involving microscopy which has been highly used for monitoring coffee authenticity although not always efficiently enough.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D003069', 'D005506', 'D005607', 'D015203', 'D003313']","['Coffee', 'Food Contamination', 'Fraud', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Zea mays']",Three centuries on the science of coffee authenticity control.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600685,2021

34328489,"Species-specific isotope dilution mass spectrometry (SS-IDMS) has been the calibration method of choice for high accuracy speciation analysis because it can correct for detector sensitivity drifts, matrix effects, and analyte loss during sample preparation and analysis. However, in many cases SS-IDMS calibration is either not applicable (e.g. for monoisotopic elements) or not feasible (e.g. limited by the cost and availability of like-for-like isotopically enriched species). The work presented here demonstrates the potential of a novel on-column species-specific internal calibration approach, which is based on the chromatographic injection of the same species of the analyte as the internal standard (IS), after the sample injection.

In this study, a robust and accurate analytical method that could authenticate the geographical origin of Geographical Indication (GI) products was developed. The method was based on elemental profiling using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in combination with machine learning techniques for model building and feature selection. The method successfully predicted and classified six varieties of Chinese GI rice. The elemental profiles of 131 rice samples were determined, and two machine learning algorithms were implemented, support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), together with the feature selection algorithm Relief. Prediction accuracy of 100% was achieved by both Relief-SVM and Relief-RF models, using only four elements (Al, B, Rb, and Na).

34236211,"The cosmopolitan species Fusarium graminearum Schwabe directly reduces yield, as well as grain quality of cereals, due to its ability to synthesize mycotoxins. Previously it was considered to be one species occurring on all continents. However, phylogenetic analysis employing the GCPSR method (Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition) revealed the existence of 15 phylogenetic species within what is now recognised as the Fusarium graminearum Species Complex (FGSC) (Sarver et al. 2011). During 1996-2008, a MRIZP collection of FGSC isolates was established and isolates originating from wheat (5), maize (3) and barely (2) were selected for further study. Morphological features including the appearance of colonies and macroconidia (average size 38.5-53.1 × 4.6-5.4 µm, No 50) of all 10 isolates on PDA were consistent with descriptions of F. graminearum (O'Donnell et al. 2004, Leslie and Summerell 2006). Total DNA was isolated from mycelium removed from 7-day old colonies of single-spore isolates grown on PDA using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden). Further identification was based on amplification and sequencing of elongation factor TEF-1α, histone H3 and β-tubulin in both directions, with primers ef1/ef2, H3-1a/H3-1b and T1/T22, respectively (Jacobs et al. 2010). The sequences were deposited in NCBI under accession numbers MF974399 - MF974408 (TEF-1α), MG063783 - MG063792 (β-tubulin) and MF999139 - MF999148 (histone H3). Sequence analysis was performed using BLAST while genetic similarity was calculated using MEGA 6.0 software. Isolate 1339 originating from wheat (collected at the locality of Kikinda in 2006), shared 100% nucleotide identity with TEF-1α (DQ459745), histone H3 (DQ459728) and β-tubulin (DQ459643) of F. vorosii isolate NRRL37605 (Starkey et al. 2007). The remaining nine isolates were identified as F. graminearum as they shared 99% to 100% nucleotide similarity with F. graminearum NRRL 28439 (O'Donnell et al. 2004). Pathogenicity was tested using artificial inoculations of spikes during wheat flowering (Mesterhazy et al. 1999). Thirty classes were inoculated with each isolate, in three replicates. Inoculum was prepared from 7-day colonies on PDA, and 30 ml of a conidia suspension (1x105 conidia/ml) was used. Control plants were inoculated with sterile water. Three weeks after inoculation, typical Fusarium head blight symptoms were visible on inoculated plants, from which all 10 isolates were successfully reisolated. Control spikes remained symptomless. Disease severity was estimated on the 1-7 scale (Blandino et al. 2012). Average pathogenicity of the F. vorosii isolate 1339 was 1.9, and 2.4 -5.1 of F. graminearum isolates. Toxin production was determined using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Kernels inoculated with the 10 isolates were ground and tested for the presence of deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetyl derivatives 3ADON, 15ADON and NIV. F. vorosii isolate 1339 possessed the 15ADON chemotype, as well as eight F. graminearum isolates, while only one F. graminearum isolate was 3ADON chemotype. To date, F. vorosii has only been detected in Hungary on wheat (Toth et al. 2005) and Korea on barley, corn and rice (Lee et al. 2016).

However, obtaining accurate assay results with modern analytical instruments remains a major challenge. The two reasons for this setback are the ultralow concentration of 2-AP in samples and the serious interferences in its determination. In natural fragrant rice, the concentration of 2-AP is very low, at the μg/kg level. The interferences mainly originate from the sample matrix or due to co-elution during chromatographic separation. In the present paper, various methods for the sample pretreatment and instrumental analysis of 2-AP in rice are reviewed. The sample pretreatment methods include distillation, extraction, and headspace enrichment procedures. Common instrumental analytical methods include gas chromatography (GC) or GC-mass spectrometry (MS), GC-olfactometry, and derivatization-high performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS developed by the researchers recently.

Gram-scale quantities of these compounds were needed as feedstock for semi-synthesizing RAL-analogues in a step-economical fashion. To do so, this study had three primary goals: identifying fungi that biosynthesized 1 and 2, enhancing their production by optimizing the fermentation conditions on the lab scale, and developing straight forward purification processes. After evaluating 536 fungal extracts via an in-house dereplication protocol, three strains were identified as producing cis-enone RALs (i.e., MSX78495, MSX63935, MSX45109). Screening these fungal strains on three grain-based media revealed enhanced production of 1 by strain MSX78495 on oatmeal medium, while rice medium increased the biosynthesis of 2 by strain MSX63935. Furthermore, the purification processes were improved, moving away from HPLC purification to utilizing two to four cycles of resuspension and centrifugation in small volumes of organic solvents, generating gram-scale quantities of these metabolites readily.

33919454,"In China, green food refers to a wide array of certified agricultural and processed edible commodities that are produced strictly following defined standard protocols and labelled with a specified ""Green Food"" logo. The demand for green labelled rice is rapidly growing due to its higher quality and adherence to safety standards compared to conventional rice. Therefore, the physicochemical and nutritional quality of green rice needs to be further investigated for consumers' benefits. Using Daohuaxiang 2, one of the most famous types of green rice, we found that green rice was significantly superior to conventional rice in terms of thousand kernel weight, chalkiness, amylose content, and rheological properties. Green rice contained lower levels of heavy metals than conventional rice due to a dramatic reduction in chemical inputs during its cultivation. The concentrations of Cr, As, Cd, Pb in green rice decreased, respectively, from 98.7 to 180.1 μg/kg, 49.8 to 62.3 μg/kg, 7.8 to 9.1 μg/kg, and 29.0 to 42.8 μg/kg on average. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics, in combination with multivariate analysis, revealed that 15 metabolites differentially accumulated when comparing green and conventional rice. Among these, 12 metabolites showed a high accumulation in green rice, including seven amino acids, two sugars, and three fatty acids. Overall, our results suggest the superior quality of a type of green rice that is popular in China, which may boost green rice consumption and facilitate the further expansion of green rice production in China.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Green Labelled Rice Shows a Higher Nutritional and Physiochemical Quality Than Conventional Rice in China.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919454,2021

Soy and rice drinks are the most successful milk substitutes but are low in fiber and protein contents, respectively, whilst being rich in sugars. Generally, an improvement is foreseen; thus, apart from supplement addition, a natural occurring strategy is functionalizing the drinks by beneficial bacteria fermentation. The aim of this work is to develop novel plant-based drinks assessing different mixtures of soy and rice milks fermented with single or multi-strain probiotics (Lactobacillus fermentum, L. plantarum, L. helveticus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and B. longum). The drinks were characterized to study bacterial performances, by means of culture-dependent and -independent techniques, and their volatilome, by means of solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) analysis. Through multivariate analysis, these features were investigated and correlated to define accurate descriptors of the produced functional drinks. The results showed that combined drinks and multi-strain fermentation generated higher-value products. For example, combined drinks in comparison with single ones had a lower amount of toxic 2-acetyl-3,5-dimethylfuran and higher abundances of desirable compounds such as 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy and butanoic acid.

Median (min-max) intakes of MMA, DMA and AsB were <2.3 (<2.3-<2.3), 4.57 (<2.3-24.3), and 13.6 (<2.4-231) μg As/day, respectively, and median urinary concentrations were 1.90 (<0.37-26.), 21.9 (<0.27-141) and 19.6 (<0.37-1063) ng As/mg creatinine, respectively. Interrelationships between intake levels and urinary concentrations were mostly significant with positive coefficients indicating mutual association due to co-exposure, metabolism and/or dietary habit. Urinary concentrations and intake levels of AsB were also positively correlated confirming the applicability of urine analysis as biomarker of exposure.

Arsenic mobility determines its bioavailability and entry into the food chain. Nanoparticle application may help to control As mobility in crop cultivation media, and thus decreasing As bioavailability for plants. This research studied the adsorption kinetics of As(V) on copper oxide nanoparticles (nCuO) and nCuO dissolution in a hydroponic solution, and the effects of nCuO on As mobility in a greenhouse system exposed to As(V) addition of 10 mg/kg and nCuO at 0.1-100 mg/L for a life-cycle growth of rice. Arsenic adsorption was dependent on both the total mass and the concentration of nCuO as well as the initial concentration of As(V), while nCuO dissolution was mainly dependent on nCuO concentration regardless of As(V). Arsenic in the simulated paddy was quickly mobilized from soil to aqueous phase during week 1, and further interacted with components in water phase, sediment-water interfacial transition and rice plants. Copper (Cu) and As speciation in the soil were observed by X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Spectrometry. Dissolved Cu was complexed with organic ligands. As(V) was adsorbed to kaolinite, or reduced to As(III) and adsorbed to ferrihydrite. Percent As removal from water phase in the growth container was determined by both nCuO application and As(V) initial concentration. Based on our previous finding that As accumulation in rice grains was significantly decreased by nCuO at 50 mg/L and the results of this study on As adsorption capacity of nCuO and As removal from water due to nCuO application, nCuO at 50 mg/L was proposed to be an appropriate application in rice paddy to immobilize As.

The mixed-mode mechanism including molecular affinity adsorption (between aptamers and targets), hydrophilic interaction and ionic interaction (between stationary phase and targets) were adopted and provided a better flexibility in adjusting separation selectivity to reduce nonspecific adsorption with respect to the single mode. Preparation and characterization of aptamer-based affinity monoliths were investigated, The characterization of pore size distribution, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and the specificity and cross-reaction were also evaluated. As a result, the hydrophilic nature and negative charge on affinity monolith were obtained. Multiple interactions including aptamer affinity binding, hydrophilic interaction (HI) and ion exchange (IE) could be adopted for online selective extraction. Specific recognitions of polar ochratoxin A (OTA), non-polar zearalenone (ZEN) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was fulfilled with LODs as 0.03, 0.05 and 0.05 μg/L, respectively.

We conducted personal interviews, blood and urine sampling, and analyzed the concentrations of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in whole blood and Cd in urine using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. The geometric means of blood Pb, blood Cd, and urine Cd were 2.27 μg/dL, 1.42 μg/L, and 1.66 μg/g creatinine, respectively. The level of metal exposure was lower than that reported from the first phase health survey in Korea (2008‒2011) but was higher than in the general population of Korea. Blood Pb was higher in males while blood Cd and urine Cd were significantly higher in females. Blood Pb was highest in the 40‒59 age group, while blood and urine Cd levels continuously increased until age 80 or older. The Cd levels in blood and urine were affected by consumption of locally produced rice and duration of residence near abandoned mines. Furthermore, negative correlations were observed between blood Pb and blood and urine Cd levels. Additionally, 252 of the 4500 subjects exceeded the thresholds of blood Cd or urine Cd levels.

This study aimed to determine the beneficial effects of L. paracasei FZU103 on improving hepatic lipid accumulation associated with hyperlipidemia. Results indicated that L. paracasei FZU103 intervention significantly inhibited the abnormal growth of body weight and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), prevented the hypertrophy of epididymal adipocytes, ameliorated the biochemical parameters of serum and liver related to lipid metabolism in HFD-fed mice. Histological analysis also showed that the excessive accumulation oflipid dropletsin the livers induced by HFD-feeding was greatly alleviated by L. paracasei FZU103 intervention. In addition, L. paracasei FZU103 also promoted the excretion of bile acids (BAs) through feces. Metagenomic analysis revealed that oral supplementation with L. paracasei FZU103 significantly increased the relative abundance of Ruminococcus, Alistipes, Pseudoflavonifractor and Helicobacter, but decreased the levels of Blautia, Staphylococcos and Tannerella in HFD-fed mice. The relationships between lipid metabolic parameters and intestinal microbial phylotypes were also revealed by correlation heatmap and network. Furthermore, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS)-based liver metabolomics demonstrated that L. paracasei FZU103 had a significant regulatory effect on the metabolic pathways of glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, fatty acid elongation, unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis, riboflavin metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, etc. Additionally, L. paracasei FZU103 intervention regulated expression of hepatic genes involved in lipid metabolism and bile acid homeostasis, and promoted fecal excretion of intestinal BAs.

To assess the degree of environmental and human contamination with neonicotinoids we collected soil, water and people's hair in three agricultural regions of the Philippines and analysed them by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS-MS). Five neonicotinoids, namely acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam were targeted. Residues of neonicotinoids were found in 78% of 67 soil samples from the three provinces. Total neonicotinoid loads ranged on average between 0.017 and 0.89 μg/kg in soils of rice, banana and vegetable crops, and were 130 times higher (113.5 μg/kg) in soils of a citrus grove. Imidacloprid was the most prevalent compound at an average of 0.56 μg/kg in soil while thiacloprid was below the limit of detection. Half of the eight water samples from a rice field and nearby creek contained residues of imidacloprid (mean 1.29 ng/L) and one contained thiamethoxam (0.15 ng/L).

Very few studies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have studied blood lead levels (BLLs) and non-gasoline sources of exposure in children. Data from a birth cohort in Benin (2011-2013) suggested that 58% of 1-year-old children had BLLs > 50 ug/L. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of elevated BLLs (>50 µg/L and >100 µg /L) among 425 of these children at 6 years of age in 2016-2018 and to compare BLLs between age 1 and 6 years, and study sources of lead at age 6 years. BLLs were analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression and quantile regressions were used to study potential sources of lead. The prevalence of BLLs > 50 µg/L in children was 59.5% (Geometric Mean (GM) 56.4 µg/L, 95% CI: 54.1-58.7) at 6 years of age compared to 54.8% (GM 56.5 µg/L, 95% CI: 53.4-59.6) at 1 year of age. The prevalence of children with BLLs > 100 µg/L decreased from 14.4% at 1 year of age to 8.2% at 6 years of age. After adjustment for all other covariates, consumption of peanuts more than once per month was significantly associated with a 22.0% (95% CI: 4.6, 42.5) increment in BLLs at age 6 years compared with no consumption. Consumption of bushmeat killed by lead bullets at age 6 years was associated with an increase in the higher percentiles of BLLs (P75) compared with the absence of this source. Other potential sources of lead associated with BLLs with marginal significance were consumption of rice, paternal occupational exposure, and the presence of activity with the potential use of lead. This prospective cohort confirms the persistently high prevalence of elevated BLLs in children residing in a rural region in the south of Benin, as well as the presence of multiple and continuous sources of lead.

The objective of this study was to develop an improved pigment-producing strain of M. purpureus MTCC 1090 through genome shuffling followed by detailed analytical estimations of pigments and other bioactive compounds produced by the fusant. Protoplast formation was optimum with 12 h-old mycelia incubated at 30 °C with cellulase, lyticase, and chitinase (40:1:1) for 5 h. Four UV-induced mutants that produced 13.1-39.5% higher amount of yellow, orange, and red pigments in fermented low-grade (cheap) broken rice were used as parents for genome shuffling. After the first round of fusion, four fusants with 35.9-60.52% higher pigment production capabilities were fused again, and finally the fusant F2-19 with distinct culture characteristic was selected under multi-selection pressure. It consistently produced 67%, 70%, and 76% higher content of yellow, orange, and red pigments respectively as compared to the wild-type. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis also reveals clear variation in pigment productions between wild-type and the fusant. Furthermore, HPLC analysis of F2-19 fermented rice extract confirms the production of 186 ± 8.71 and 3810 ± 29.81 mg/kg mevinolin and gamma-aminobutyric acid respectively. Citrinin was not detected. F2-19 fermented rice also has high antioxidant activity (7.92 ± 0.32 mg/g trolox equivalent), with good amount of phenolics (18.0 ± 0.95 mg/g gallic acid equivalent) and flavonoids (2.7 ± 0.26 mg/g quercetin equivalent). Thus, genome shuffling was successfully implemented on M. purpureus for the first time to develop a citrinin-free, better-performing fusant that holds future biotechnological potential. KEY POINTS: • Genome shuffling was performed by recursive protoplast fusion in Monascus purpureus. • The selected fusant, F2-19, was used in solid-state fermentation using low-grade rice. • It produced 67-76% higher content of yellow, orange, and red pigments than the wild-type. • HPLC detected 186 mg/kg mevinolin and 3810 mg/kg γ-aminobutyric acid, but no citrinin. • F2-19 shows high antioxidant activity with good amount of phenolics and flavonoids.

None of the samples exceeded the codex standards set for Pb (200 μg/kg in cereals and pulses) and Cd (100 μg/kg in cereals/pulses and 400 μg/kg in polished rice). However, brown rice and one white rice sample did exceed the codex standard for As (200 μg/kg). Essential elements were higher in other grains than in white and brown rice.

Currently, a comprehensive database on dicarbonyls in foods that covers the entire range of food groups is lacking, limiting knowledge about the amount of dicarbonyls that is ingested via food. The aim of this study was to analyze the dicarbonyls methylglyoxal (MGO), glyoxal (GO), and 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG) in commonly-consumed products in a Western diet. We validated a UHPLC-MS/MS method to quantify MGO, GO, and 3-DG. We present a dietary dicarbonyl database of 223 foods and drinks. Total dicarbonyl concentrations were highest in dried fruit, Dutch spiced cake, and candy bars (>400 mg/kg). Total dicarbonyl concentrations were lowest in tea, dairy, light soft drinks, and rice (<10 mg/kg).

Some researchers think it is related to grain cracking characters of rice husk, while others have linked it to volatile compounds in rice grains. In this paper, using 117 micro-core germplasm resources of rice and the investigation on the rate of insect damage, sixteen materials with different insect-resistance and four with significant difference in insect resistance were selected. Pentanamide, a volatile compound in rice, was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and found to be negatively correlated with the rate of insect damage of rice materials. The bioassay results showed that 8% Pentanamide had a good effect on controlling storage pests and trapping pests.

33143979,"Developing a biotechnical system with rapid degradation of pesticide is critical for reducing environmental, food security and health risks. Here, we investigated a novel epigenetic mechanism responsible for the degradation of the pesticide atrazine (ATZ) in rice crops mediated by the key component CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1a (OsCOI1a) in the jasmonate-signaling pathway. OsCOI1a protein was localized to the nucleus and strongly induced by ATZ exposure. Overexpression of OsCOI1a (OE) significantly conferred resistance to ATZ toxicity, leading to the improved growth and reduced ATZ accumulation (particularly in grains) in rice crops. HPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis revealed increased ATZ-degraded products in the OE plants, suggesting the occurrence of vigorous ATZ catabolism. Bisulfite-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that ATZ exposure drastically reduced DNA methylation at CpG context and histone H3K9me2 marks in the upstream of OsCOI1a. The causal relationships between the DNA demethylation (hypomethylatioin), OsCOI1a expression and subsequent detoxification and degradation of ATZ in rice and environment were well established by several lines of biological, genetic and chemical evidence. Our work uncovered a novel regulatory mechanism implicated in the defense linked to the epigenetic modification and jasmonate signaling pathway. It also provided a modus operandi that can be used for metabolic engineering of rice to minimize amounts of ATZ in the crop and environment.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D001280', 'D003517', 'D044127', 'D006540', 'D012275', 'D054883', 'D010575', 'D015398', 'D053719']","['Atrazine', 'Cyclopentanes', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Herbicides', 'Oryza', 'Oxylipins', 'Pesticides', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Identification of a novel function of a component in the jasmonate signaling pathway for intensive pesticide degradation in rice and environment through an epigenetic mechanism.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33143979,2020

Exposure to these elements has been shown to decrease immune function, impair growth, and decrease reproductive output in wildlife. The present study compares trace element concentrations in green turtles in captivity at Sea Life Park Hawaii (n = 6) to wild green turtles in Kapoho Bay, Hawaii, USA (n = 5-7). Blood and scute samples were collected and analyzed for 11 elements via inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Selenium was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the blood of captive turtles compared with wild turtles, whereas V, Ni, and Pb were significantly greater in the blood of wild turtles. In scute, V, Cu, Se, and Cr were significantly greater in captive turtles, whereas As was significantly greater in wild turtles. Pelleted food fed to the captive turtles and representative samples of the wild turtle diet were analyzed via ICP-MS to calculate trophic transfer factors and daily intake values. Wild turtles had greater estimated daily intake than captive turtles for all elements except Cu and Se. Because captive turtles are fed a diet very different from that of their wild counterparts, captive turtles do not represent control or reference samples for chemical exposure studies in wild turtles. No toxic thresholds are known for sea turtles, but rehabilitation and managed care facilities should monitor sea turtle elemental concentrations to ensure the animals' health.

Herein, instant green tea (IGT), instant black tea (IBT) and matcha (Mat) (1, 2 and 3% w/w, rice basis) were added to lower the in vitro starch digestibility and improve the eating quality of CR prepared with an electric rice cooker. The results showed that adding tea products at each level could remarkably reduce the in vitro starch digestibility of CR. Compared with IGT and IBT, 3% of Mat significantly decreased the contents of rapidly digestible starch (RDS) from 72.96% to 60.99%, the digestion rate constant (K) from 11.4 × 10-2 to 8.68 × 10-2 min-1 and the expected glycemic index (eGI) from 77.55 to 66.86. Furthermore, the gas chromatography-ion migration spectrum was analysed to confirm that the tea products endowed the cooked rice with a refreshing flavor by inducing the redistribution of the main aroma components. Moreover, it was found that increasing the ordered crystal structure of rice grains played a major role on lowering the starch digestion, which was demonstrated by the results of the Rapid Visco Analyser, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. These findings suggested that cooking rice with tea products, especially Mat, can be useful in enhancing the palatability and slowing the in vitro digestion properties of CR.",Food & function,"['D001786', 'D028241', 'D003296', 'D004063', 'D005503', 'D038321', 'D006801', 'D012275', 'D028321', 'D012639', 'D017550', 'D013213', 'D014961']","['Blood Glucose', 'Camellia sinensis', 'Cooking', 'Digestion', 'Food Additives', 'Glycemic Index', 'Humans', 'Oryza', 'Plant Preparations', 'Seeds', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Starch', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",Effects of tea products on ,"['Q000378', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None]","['metabolism', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33094308,2021

Volatiles from fermentation and lipids oxidation are transferred from crumb to crust, and they flow out to the air together with Maillard and caramelisation compounds from the crust. In this study, the release to the oven of volatile compounds from five gluten-free breads (quinoa, teff and rice flours, and corn and wheat starches) and wheat bread during baking and toasting was measured in real-time using proton transfer reaction-time of flight-mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS). Baking showed different volatile release patterns that are described by bell-shaped curves, plateaus and exponential growths. Flour-based breads had the higher overall volatile release during baking, but also high ratios in the final bread, while starch-based breads showed high pyrazine releases due to moisture losses. Meanwhile, toasting promoted the release of volatile compounds from the bread matrix, but also the additional generation of volatiles from Maillard reaction and caramelisation. Interestingly, gluten-free breads presented higher losses of volatiles during baking than wheat bread, which could partially explain their weaker aroma.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Real-Time Monitoring of Volatile Compounds Losses in the Oven during Baking and Toasting of Gluten-Free Bread Doughs: A PTR-MS Evidence.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092071,2020

32930255,"Aflatoxins (AFs), as the secondary metabolites of the toxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, are well known to be extremely harmful to humans and animals because of their high toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity. Recurring and increasing studies on AF ingestion incidents indicate that AF contamination is a serious food safety issue worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, the IAC method may be limited to some laboratories because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) clean-up method based on humic acids (HAs), which is followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAs could be directly used as a DSPE sorbent after simple treatment without any chemical modification. In the HA-DSPE, AFs could remain on the HA sorbent by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was retained on HA via only hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix could be sufficiently washed off by n-hexane, whereas the AFs could still be retained on HA; thus, the selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices were achieved. Under the optimal conditions of HA-DSPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.3% to 106.2% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices i.e. blended oil, mixed olive oil, tea oil, sunflower seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, rice oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. Minor matrix effects ranging from 89.3% to 112.9% were obtained for the four AFs, which were acceptable. Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.063 and 0.102 μg kg-1 completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union (EU), China, or other countries. The proposed methodology was further validated using a naturally contaminated peanut oil, and the results indicated that the accuracy of the HA-DSPE could match the accuracy of the referenced IAC. In addition, HA-DSPE can be used to directly treat diluted edible oil without liquid-liquid extraction and HA is cheap and can be easily obtained from the market worldwide; these advantages make the proposed methodology simple, low-cost, and accessible for the determination of AFs in edible oils.",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,"['D000348', 'D001230', 'D001231', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004042', 'D005504', 'D006812', 'D010938', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Aflatoxins', 'Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Humic Substances', 'Plant Oils', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Facile dispersive solid-phase extraction based on humic acid for the determination of aflatoxins in various edible oils.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930255,2021

Optimization of polymerization reaction and polymer recipe were studied, and characteristics such as structural morphology, affinity performance and specificity to ZEN were evaluated. A highly hydrophilic POSS-based aptamer affinity monolith was rapidly prepared in 1.1 h, and a high capacity of aptamer reached 2772.61 pmol/μL that was much higher than that of the current POSS-based aptamer affinity monoliths. By this way, the hydrophilic nature and aptamer coverage indensity in POSS monoliths were well improved. The mixed-mode mechanism including aptamer affinity recognition and hydrophilic interaction were employed for the specific analysis of ZEN. Applied to the monitoring of ZEN, a good selective recognition and sensitive detection were obtained with the detection limit (LOD) of 0.02 ng/mL. The stability and reproducibility were acceptable and the intra-day, inter-day and column-to-column relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the ZEN recovery were gained in the range from 2.28% to 5.32%, respectively. Satisfactory recoveries of ZEN in rice samples were realized ad 98.6 ± 2.8%-100.8 ± 2.0%.

Using in vitro testing in human macrophages, a rice derived functional ingredient natural peptide network (NPN) significantly reduced Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α secretion in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Using artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize rice NPNs lead to the identification of seven potentially active peptides, the presence of which was confirmed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Characterization of this network revealed the constituent peptides displayed anti-inflammatory properties as predicted in vitro. The rice NPN was then tested in an elderly ""inflammaging"" population with a view to subjectively assess symptoms of digestive discomfort through a questionnaire. While the primary subjective endpoint was not achieved, analysis of objectively measured physiological and physical secondary readouts showed clear significant benefits on the ability to carry out physical challenges such as a chair stand test that correlated with a decrease in blood circulating TNF-α. Importantly, the changes observed were without additional exercise or specific dietary alterations.

Several human poisoning cases through consumption of cereals were reported over the last years and highlighted the need for reliable and robust analytical methodologies for safety control. To rationalize analyses in high-throughput laboratory environments dealing with shorter and shorter turn-around-around time, the scope of our multi mycotoxins method was extended to the analysis of two regulated tropane alkaloids, namely atropine and scopolamine. Extraction procedure is based on the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Efficient, Rugged, and Safe) approach followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection. Quantification is performed by the isotopic dilution approach using labelled isotopomers as internal standard. The procedure was validated at two fortification levels (0.5 µg/kg and 10 µg/kg) on different cereal-based products according to the European SANTE/12682/2019 document and performance parameters such as precision (RSD(r) ≤ 6%, RSD(iR) ≤ 6%) and recovery (82-114%) fulfilled its requirements. The limit of quantification (0.5 µg/kg) is low enough to ensure compliance with existing regulations. The method was further applied on 95 cereals and cereal-based products collected from Asian and African countries. All samples were found free of the two targeted TAs, with the exception of a rice-based product in which both atropine and scopolamine were quantified at 9.6 µg/kg and 2.6 µg/kg, respectively. A total of 29 cereals samples, shown to be free of both atropine and scopolamine were also analysed for mycotoxins.

For the appropriate health risk assessment more data on exposure levels in the general population, especially in susceptible groups such as pregnant women, the elderly and children are needed. The aims of the present study were to estimate the exposure to GLY and its major metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in children and adolescents living in agricultural areas, to identify possible determinants of the exposure, and to assess co-exposure with elements. In total, 149 children (aged 7-10 years, 55% girls) and 97 adolescents (aged 12-15 years; 44% girls) were recruited in 2018 from rural areas of Northeastern Slovenia. The effect of seasonal GLY application on the exposure was estimated using GLY and AMPA levels determined by GC-MS/MS in first morning urine in winter (n = 246) and in late-spring/early-summer seasons (n = 225). Levels of elements were determined by ICP-MS in urine in both samplings and in blood or plasma in the first sampling. Questionnaire data on basic characteristics, dietary habits, living environments and use of pesticides were obtained for all participants. GLY and AMPA were detected in 27% and 50% of urine samples from the first sampling period, respectively; and in 22% and 56% from the second sampling period, respectively. Geometric means and medians of both AMPA and GLY were below or at the limit of quantification (≤LOQ; 0.1 µg/L). Children rather than adolescents tended to have higher exposure, as did, boys rather than girls among adolescents. The exposure did not significantly differ between both sampling periods. Except for one individual, exposure was not higher among participants who reported use of GLY or herbicides in the vicinity of child's home or live in close vicinity of agriculture, orchards, vineyards, gardens, sport courts or cemeteries. The extensive food consumption frequency data revealed higher exposure to GLY and AMPA only among individuals with higher consumption of nuts and wholegrain rice. Levels of AMPA and GLY were significantly positively correlated, with considerably stronger correlation in urine of the second than the first sampling (Spearman's rank coefficient: 0.49 vs 0.22, respectively). Urine levels of As, Pb, Co, Zn and Cu were significantly higher in participants with GLY and/or AMPA levels ≥LOQ than with levels <LOQ. In conclusion, this first estimation of GLY and AMPA exposure in a Slovenian study population showed much lower levels when compared to levels reported in similar studies worldwide.

32719085,"Commercial formulations of 29 commonly used herbal supplements (HSs) and grapefruit juice were evaluated for drug interaction potential via quantification of their CYP3A inhibitory potential in two in vitro experimental models of human small intestine, cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa (CHIM), and cryopreserved human enterocytes (CHEs). Two CYP3A substrates were used-in the studies with CHIM, CYP3A activity was quantified via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry quantification of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, whereas in CHE, luciferin-IPA metabolism to luciferin was quantified by luminescence. Upon treatment of CHIM with the estimated lumen concentration of the HS upon each oral administration (manufacturers' recommended dosage dissolved in 200 ml of culture medium), >80% CYP3A inhibition was observed for green tea extract, St. John's wort, valerian root, horehound, and grapefruit juice. Less than 50% inhibition was observed for fenugreek, aloe vera, guarana, soy isoflavone, maca, echinacea, spirulina, evening primrose, milk thistle, cranberry, red yeast rice, rhodiola, ginkgo biloba, turmeric, curcumin, white kidney bean, garlic, cinnamon, saw palmetto berries, panax ginseng, black elderberry, wheat grass juice, flaxseed oil, black cohosh, and ginger root. The results were confirmed in a a dose-response study with HSs obtained from three suppliers for the four inhibitory HSs (green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, valerian root) and three representative noninhibitory HSs (black cohosh, black elderberry, echinacea). Similar results were obtained with the inhibitory HSs in CHE. The results illustrate that CHIM and CHE represent physiologically relevant in vitro experimental models for the evaluation of drug interaction potential of herbal supplements. Based on the results, green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, and valerian root may cause drug interactions with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates, as was observed for grapefruit juice. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In vitro evaluation of 29 popular herbal supplements in cryopreserved human intestinal mucosa identified green tea extract, horehound, St. John's wort, and valerian root to have CYP3A inhibitory potential similar to that for grapefruit juice, suggesting their potential to have clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction with orally administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates.

Only eight isolates were found to grow and proliferate under different abiotic stress conditions. These isolates were identified using 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequence and submitted to the NCBI database. All the bacterial isolates were identified as Bacillus sp., except PB24, which was identified as Staphylococcus sp., and these isolates were further screened for plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits such as IAA production, GA production, ACC deaminase activity, and exopolysaccharide production under three different osmotic stress conditions adjusted using polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000). Additionally, mineral solubilization was measured under the normal condition. Bacillus endophyticus PB3, Bacillus altitudinis PB46, and Bacillus megaterium PB50 were found to have multifarious PGP traits. Consecutively, the performance of an individual strain to improve the plant growth was investigated under the osmotic stress (25% PEG 6000) and nonstress condition by inoculating them into rice seeds using hydroponics culture.

We describe an analytical method for solid-phase extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (SPE-HPLC-DAD) for the detection of OPPs (quinalphos, diazinon, and chlorpyrifos) in rice grains. The isolation of targeted residues was initiated with double extraction before SPE-HPLC-DAD, crucially reducing matrix interferences and detecting a wide range of multiple residues in rice grains. Coefficients of 0.9968 to 0.9991 showed a strong linearity, with limits of detection and quantification ranging from 0.36 to 0.68 µg/kg and from 1.20 to 2.28 µg/kg, respectively. High recoveries (80.4-110.3%) were observed at 3 spiking levels (50, 100, and 200 µg/kg), indicating good accuracy. The relative standard deviations of all residues (0.19-8.66%) validated the method precision. Sample analysis of 10 rice grain types (n = 30) available in the Asian market revealed that quinalphos, diazinon, and chlorpyrifos at concentrations of 1.08, 1.11, and 1.79 µg/kg, respectively, remained far below the maximum residue limits (0.01-0.5 mg/kg).

Furthermore, fractions (i.e., albumin, globulin, prolamin and glutelin) isolated from RP complexed with anthocyanins were examined. The interactions with ACN altered the structure of RP, leading to an increase in the β-sheet and spectral shift of the amide Ⅱ band. Additionally, fluorescence spectroscopy suggested that the hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds were the dominant forces in the formation of RP-ACN complexes. It was interesting to find that the RP-ACN particles exhibited the best functional properties at pH 3, likely due to the specific conformational changes upon interaction. In addition, the combination of RP and ACN increased the antioxidant ability of RP. Overall, this research suggested that RP-ACN particles at pH 3 can be designed to form and stabilize mesostructures such as foams and emulsion, which can lead to health benefits.",Food chemistry,"['D000418', 'D000872', 'D000975', 'D045703', 'D005916', 'D005983', 'D006860', 'D006863', 'D012275', 'D014674', 'D055315', 'D011487', 'D013050', 'D017550']","['Albumins', 'Anthocyanins', 'Antioxidants', 'Emulsifying Agents', 'Globulins', 'Glutens', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Oryza', 'Plant Proteins, Dietary', 'Prolamins', 'Protein Conformation', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared']",Functional properties and structural changes of rice proteins with anthocyanins complexation.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32569969,2020

The aim of the present biomonitoring (BM) study was to provide a background for the levels of urinary aluminum (Al) in children ages 7 months to 4 years living in Beirut. MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected and analyzed 120 urine specimens using the Shimadzu Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer-6300 system equipped with an electrothermal atomization, and using a GFA-EX7i graphite furnace. RESULTS The mean and standard deviation of Al level in urine revealed 8.978±12.275 μg/L, which is within the lower range of each of populations in Germany, Taiwan, and Poland. Vitamin intake, powder rice, and the use of Al utensils proved to be major determinants for Al level in urine (significant at 95%). CONCLUSIONS The Shimadzu Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer-6300 system proved again to be an optimal and reliable instrument that can be used for the determination of Al level in urine, especially if using a GFA-EX7i pyrolytic graphite furnace.

32339843,"In Southern China, rice-oil rotations occur on soils with high levels of cadmium (Cd) and low levels of available boron (B). Boron can alleviate Cd toxicity, as it affects the plant cell wall structures and the components that block the entry of Cd into the cytoplasm; however, these mechanisms are not well understood. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), fluorescent probe dye, electron microscope, ion abundance (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), metabonomics and transcriptomics were used in the study, and we found that under Cd stress, B increased root pectin content by affecting the biosynthesis pathways and decreasing the activity of pectinase and the expression levels of related genes. The increased pectin content and pectin demethylation increased the chelation of Cd onto the cell walls and reduced the levels of Cd entering the organelles. Application of B to the roots decreased the amounts of cellulose and hemicellulose in the cell walls to normal levels and promoted the expression of genes from the expansin, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase, and α-xylosidase families. This contributed to cell wall integrity and root flexibility. Consequently, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species was inhibited and cell viability in the roots was increased, which reduced the destruction of root surface structures. These results have improved our understanding of how B participates in chelation of Cd onto cell walls and in maintaining cell wall integrity, thereby improving Cd toxicity resistance in rapeseed roots.",The Science of the total environment,"['D001895', 'D029688', 'D002104', 'D002473', 'D002681', 'D018517']","['Boron', 'Brassica napus', 'Cadmium', 'Cell Wall', 'China', 'Plant Roots']",Boron alleviates cadmium toxicity in Brassica napus by promoting the chelation of cadmium onto the root cell wall components.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339843,2020

Among the attempts aimed to optimize the Se concentration in rice, only few studies have been focused on the use of irrigation methods other than continuous flooding. Since intermittent irriguous methods, like sprinkler and saturation, have found to be effective in modifying the bioaccumulation of arsenic and cadmium in rice kernels, the main goal of this study is to measure the amount of the total Se contained in grains of 26 rice genotypes cultivated for two consecutive agrarian vintages in the same open field and with the same water, but differently irrigated with continuous flooding, sprinkler or saturation. To do this, an original and validated ICP-MS method has been developed. The validation parameters accounted for a high sensitivity and accuracy. Sprinkler irrigation is able to reduce in the average of 90% the amount of total Se in kernels in comparison to values measured in rice irrigated with continuous flooding. In conclusion, different irrigation techniques and rice genotypes seem to be valuable tools in order to allow in the future the customized modulation of the Se concentration in rice grain according to the needs of the various populations.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D057914', 'D001151', 'D002523', 'D005838', 'D013058', 'D012275', 'D015203', 'D012643', 'D012987', 'D012989']","['Agricultural Irrigation', 'Arsenic', 'Edible Grain', 'Genotype', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oryza', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Selenium', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants']",Tuning of the Amount of Se in Rice (,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32316646,2021

32226996,"Lactobacillus plantarum FZU3013, a probiotic previously isolated from the traditional brewing process of Hongqu rice wine, may have the beneficial effect of improving the disorders of lipid metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the role of L. plantarum FZU3013 in improving non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) associated with hyperlipidemia in mice fed a high-fat diet. The results indicated that L. plantarum FZU3013 intervention significantly reduced the HFD-induced body weight gain and the abnormal levels of serum total triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and inhibited the excessive accumulation of liver lipids. In addition, L. plantarum FZU3013 also promoted the excretion of bile acids through feces. Metagenomic and multivariate statistical analysis revealed that L. plantarum FZU3013 made significant structural changes in the intestinal microbiome of the mice fed with HFD, in particular by modulating the relative abundance of some function related microbial phylotypes. Furthermore, ultra-performance liquid chromatography with quadruple-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS)-based liver metabolomics demonstrated that L. plantarum FZU3013 had a significant regulatory effect on the composition of liver metabolites in hyperlipidemic mice, especially on the levels of some important biomarkers involved in the pathways of glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, fatty acid elongation, glycerolipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, etc. Moreover, L. plantarum FZU3013 regulated the mRNA expression levels of the genes responsible for liver lipid and cholesterol metabolism. L. plantarum FZU3013 intervention increased the hepatic mRNA levels of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and the bile salt export pump (BSEP), suggesting enhanced bile acid synthesis and excretion from the liver. These findings present new evidence supporting that L. plantarum FZU3013 has the potential to improve lipid metabolism disorders through modulating specific intestinal microbial phylotypes and regulating hepatic lipid metabolism related genes, therefore it could be used as a potential functional food for the prevention of NAFL and hyperlipidemia.",Food & function,"['D000273', 'D000818', 'D001647', 'D001835', 'D002784', 'D002790', 'D059305', 'D005243', 'D000069196', 'D006949', 'D048191', 'D050356', 'D052439', 'D050155', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D051379', 'D065626', 'D019936', 'D014280']","['Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Bile Acids and Salts', 'Body Weight', 'Cholesterol', 'Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Hyperlipidemias', 'Lactobacillus plantarum', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism Disorders', 'Lipogenesis', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease', 'Probiotics', 'Triglycerides']",The protective mechanism of Lactobacillus plantarum FZU3013 against non-alcoholic fatty liver associated with hyperlipidemia in mice fed a high-fat diet.,"['Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000378', 'Q000009', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000188', 'Q000502', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000188', 'Q000494', 'Q000097']","['metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'blood', 'metabolism', 'adverse effects', 'microbiology', None, 'drug therapy', 'physiology', 'drug effects', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'drug therapy', 'pharmacology', 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226996,2021

32092577,"Understanding Cd uptake and distribution in rice roots is important for breeding varieties that do not accumulate Cd in the grain to any large extent. Here, we examined the physiological and molecular factors responsible for Cd uptake and transport differences between two japonica rice cultivars prescreened as high (zhefu7) or low (Xiangzaoxian45) accumulators of Cd in the grain. No significant differences in Cd uptake between the two cultivars were observed; however, Xiangzaoxian45 retained most of the absorbed Cd in the roots, whereas zhefu7 showed higher transport of Cd from the root to the shoot, regardless of the duration of exposure to Cd. The inability to sequester Cd into root vacuoles caused high accumulation of Cd in the grain in zhefu7, whereas inefficient transport of Cd from roots to shoots in Xiangzaoxian45 caused low accumulation of Cd in the grain. Cd sequestration in the roots and transport from the root to the shoot were greatly influenced by the expression patterns of transport-related genes OsHMA3 and OsHMA2, respectively. Further, micro-X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy mapping confirmed that more Cd was sequestered in the roots of Xiangzaoxian45 than in those of zhefu7, with a significant amount of Cd localized in the root hairs, as well as in the meristematic and elongation zones, and dermal and stele tissues.

In this study, three major SGs, i.e., glucosides of β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol, were synthesized and used as standards for measurement of their contents in rice bran (RB)-based fermented food (FBRA) utilizing Aspergillus oryzae and raw material (RM). The compounds were quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. It was found that β-sitosteryl glucoside was most abundant among the analyzed glucosides in both samples, and the contents of each SG in FBRA decreased about 35% from those of RM. In contrast to SGs, the contents of ASGs in FBRA increased 1.5-fold during the fermentation process as evidenced by an alkaline hydrolysis.

Furthermore, the pollution levels of the rice were evaluated based on the Nemerow index. For this purpose, we collected 353 rice samples from 16 municipal districts in Beijing and determined the As and Hg contents in these samples by microwave digestion and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

Therefore, bio-preservation could be considered as the great alternative over chemical ones owing to its potential to increase shelf-life and nutritional values of foodstuffs. In the present study, lactic acid producing bacterial species were isolated from rice rinsed water and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Lactobacillus plantarum BCH-1 (KX388380) and Lactobacillus coryniformis BCH-4 (KX388387). Antifungal metabolites from both Lactobacillus species were extracted by polarity-based solvents in which ethyl acetate showed remarkable antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus by disc diffusion assay. Different organic acids and fatty acids have been identified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, respectively. Lactic acid and citric acid were the major organic acids found in ethyl acetate fractions of L. plantarum and L. coryniformis, respectively. Similarly, 9,12-otadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)-methyl ester and hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester were the major fatty acids found in n-hexane fractions of L. plantarum and L. coryniformis respectively. Moreover, the isolation of novel antifungal metabolites from locally isolated Lactobacillus species was focused and it was revealed that organic acids are important contributors towards antifungal potential. A novel fatty acid (i.e. 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid) has also been explored and found as potential metabolite against filamentous fungi.

To date, diverse molecular markers have been used to guide field phenotypic selection, whereas accurate predictions of complex heterotic traits are rarely reported. Here, we present a practical metabolome-based strategy for predicting yield heterosis in rice. The dissection of population structure based on untargeted metabolite profiles as the initial critical step in multivariate modeling performed better than the screening of predictive variables. Then the assessment of each predictive variable's contribution to predictive models according to all latent factors was more precise than the conventional first one. Metabolites belonging to specific pathways were closely associated with yield heterosis, and the up-regulation of galactose metabolism promoted robust yield heterosis in hybrids under different growth conditions.

In this study, we tested RWL-1 against various heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, and Cd). Among the tested heavy metals, RWL-1 showed the highest tolerance for Cu stress and we observed alterations in growth kinetics with various Cu concentrations (1, 2.5, and 5 mM). We confirmed the biosorption potential of RWL-1 by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry showing that Cu ions were adsorbed on RWL-1 cell surfaces. We further tested RWL-1 for its plant growth promoting and stress reliance efficiency in response to a dose-dependent increase in soil Cu (1, 2.5, and 5 mM). The RWL-1 inoculation significantly increased seedling biomass and growth attributes compared with non-inoculated control seedlings with and without Cu stress. Moreover, RWL-1 inoculation significantly promoted a physiochemical response in seedlings with and without Cu stress by reducing Cu uptake, improving carbohydrate levels (glucose, sucrose, fructose, and raffinose), enhancing amino acids regulation, and augmenting antioxidant levels (POD, PPO, and GHS). Levels of stress-responsive phytohormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid were significantly reduced in RWL-1-inoculated seedlings as compared with non-inoculated control seedlings under normal condition and same levels of Cu stress.

Subsequently, the antimicrobial activity of each fraction was evaluated against four pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, the cationic peptides from fractions exhibiting antimicrobial activity were purified using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified using matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Of the 11 cationic peptides identified, five peptides with pI values greater than 9.31 and net charges greater than +2 were chemically synthesized for multiple functionalities, including antimicrobial, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-neutralizing, and angiogenic activities. Among these five cationic peptides, only LPR-KRK, which had a net charge of +9, exhibited antimicrobial activity against three of the four pathogenic microorganisms tested. Chromogenic LPS-neutralizing assays using Limulus amebocyte lysate showed that the 50% effective concentrations of these five peptides were between 0.11 and 3.09 μM.

31558739,"Rice bran supplementation provides nutrients, prebiotics and phytochemicals that enhance gut immunity, reduce enteric pathogens and diarrhea, and warrants attention for improvement of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) in children. EED is a subclinical condition associated with stunting due to impaired nutrient absorption. This study investigated the effects of rice bran supplementation on weight for age and length for age z-scores (WAZ, LAZ), EED stool biomarkers, as well as microbiota and metabolome signatures in weaning infants from 6 to 12 months old that reside in Nicaragua and Mali. Healthy infants were randomized to a control (no intervention) or a rice bran group that received daily supplementation with increasing doses at each month (1-5 g/day). Stool microbiota were characterized using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Stool metabolomes were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. Statistical comparisons were completed at 6, 8, and 12 months of age. Daily consumption of rice bran was safe and feasible to support changes in LAZ from 6-8 and 8-12 months of age in Nicaragua and Mali infants when compared to control. WAZ was significantly improved only for Mali infants at 8 and 12 months. Mali and Nicaraguan infants showed major differences in the overall gut microbiota and metabolome composition and structure at baseline, and thus each country cohort demonstrated distinct microbial and metabolite profile responses to rice bran supplementation when compared to control. Rice bran is a practical dietary intervention strategy that merits development in rice-growing regions that have a high prevalence of growth stunting due to malnutrition and diarrheal diseases. Rice is grown as a staple food, and the bran is used as animal feed or wasted in many low- and middle-income countries where EED and stunting is prevalent.",Scientific reports,"['D049628', 'D001835', 'D002657', 'D019587', 'D005260', 'D000069196', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D008297', 'D008302', 'D055442', 'D009527', 'D012275', 'D014886', 'D000067348']","['Body Size', 'Body Weight', 'Child Development', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mali', 'Metabolome', 'Nicaragua', 'Oryza', 'Weaning', 'Whole Grains']","Rice bran supplementation modulates growth, microbiota and metabolome in weaning infants: a clinical trial in Nicaragua and Mali.","[None, None, None, 'Q000009', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000009', None, 'Q000009']","[None, None, None, 'adverse effects', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'adverse effects', None, 'adverse effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558739,2020

Although some in vitro studies have been reported on the use of purified BA to interfere with cell metabolism, few clinical or pathological data of BA poisoning on human due to food-borne factors are available for forensic appraisal. For the first time, we retrospectively report five cases of food-borne poisoning caused by eating rice noodles, a popular traditional food in Guangdong, China, and three of the victims died. All five victims were hospitalized with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and were treated with admission diagnosis of liver failure and acute kidney damage. Certain concentrations of BA were detected in the victims' peripheral blood serums at the hospitalization (ranging from 70-345 μg/L) and the suspected poisonous foods (0-810 ng/g) with LC-MS/MS technique. The results of forensic pathological examination showed that all three deceased had severe liver and kidney damage, accompanied by multiple organ congestion and edema, which were consistent with clinical diagnosis. Combined with the clinical records, we found that the difference in blood glucose between the deceased and survivors of the five victims may be an indication of the severity of the disease. In addition, we compared BA poisoning with other diseases that can cause acute liver function damage in terms of pathological characteristics and clinical manifestations, which has important reference significance for the diagnosis and forensic appraisal of this food-borne poisoning.","Legal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)","['D058186', 'D000293', 'D000328', 'D001786', 'D001865', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D005260', 'D005517', 'D006801', 'D017114', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D009102', 'D012275', 'D055815']","['Acute Kidney Injury', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Glucose', 'Bongkrekic Acid', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Female', 'Foodborne Diseases', 'Humans', 'Liver Failure, Acute', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Oryza', 'Young Adult']",Bongkrekic acid poisoning: Severe liver function damage combined with multiple organ failure caused by eating spoiled food.,"['Q000139', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000506', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000139', None, None, 'Q000139', None, None]","['chemically induced', None, None, 'analysis', 'poisoning', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemically induced', None, None, 'chemically induced', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518860,2020

31489671,"The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro antifungal potential of carrot seed extracts, its essential oil, different fractions, isolated compounds, and their derivatives against three phytopathogenic rice fungi (Fusarium moniliforme, Bipolaris oryzae, and Rhizoctonia solani) using poisoned food technique. Carrot seed essential oil was extracted using hydrodistillation method and extracts were prepared using different solvents viz. dichloromethane, hexane, and methanol. The pure compounds daucene, carotol, and daucol were isolated using column chromatography and derivatized using different reagents. The study demonstrated that antifungal potential of all tested compounds varied in a dose dependent manner. Structure activity relationship of isolated and derivatized compounds showed that polar moieties possessed more antifungal potential as compared to non-polar moieties. The results suggested that carrot seed methanol extract and carotol possessed strong antifungal potential as compared to other components tested. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Phytopathogenic fungi are the major problems causing harmful damage to the rice crop. Only available control of these diseases is synthetic fungicides but their repeated use led to serious environmental issues, residual toxicity, and development of resistance. Therefore, it's better to find some natural alternatives. The current study was conducted to evaluate in vitro antifungal potential of carrot seed essential oil, its constituents and extracts against phytopathogenic fungi of rice. The methanol extract and carotol possessed highest antifungal potential which might be due to their polar nature. This information may add a new dimensions to biological activity of these natural molecules mainly in the field of agriculture as fungal diseases are found to be associated with major losses in agriculture.

However, the aroma of gluten-free rice bread is less accepted by consumers than that of commercial wheat bread. Therefore, 18 selected aroma compounds were determined in rice and wheat breads by stable isotope dilution assays (SIDA) to elucidate differences in the sensory characteristics, concentrations, and odor activity values (OAVs). The OAVs of most aroma compounds varied greatly between a rice and a wheat bread. In particular, 2-aminoacetophenone with a grape-like, medicinal aroma was characteristic for rice bread crumb and crust, while maltol was only relevant in wheat bread crust. Ehrlich pathway products varied in their concentration between the bread crumbs and were correlated with the contents of their corresponding free amino acid precursors in the flours and doughs. The analysis of rice flour revealed that only a few aroma compounds were retained in the bread. Consequently, the bread making process has a high relevance in aroma compound formation.

The goals of this research were to assess (1) whether specific peptides with immune-modulating activity consumed as part of a rice protein hydrolysate could be absorbed into blood and (2) whether they modulate inflammation markers. Artificial intelligence algorithms were applied to target, predict and unlock inflammation-modulating peptides from rice protein. A food application was developed containing four bioactive peptides. Protein docking simulation studies revealed high binding energies of these peptides with inflammation markers. In a small kinetic study 10 healthy subjects consumed the peptides with a single bolus of 20 g protein hydrolysate. Although absorption of the four predicted peptides at plasma concentrations deemed biologically relevant could not be confirmed (quantitative LC-MS/MS), several cytokines responded (ELISA kits). The 24-hour kinetic study revealed a slight suppression of pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IP-10 and NOx, whereas IL-6 increased temporarily (timepoints 2-12 hours). These markers returned to the baseline after 24 hours whereas others were not affected significantly (IL-10, hs-CRP, IL-8, and MCP-1).

The active ingredient lovastatin, present in lactone (LL) and hydroxy acid forms (LH), as well as the mycotoxin citrinin were analyzed in 19 red yeast rice products, including powders, dietary supplements, and Chinese proprietary medicines (Xuezhikang and Zhibituo). The HPTLC method including sample preparation allows a high throughput of matrix-rich samples (10 min per analysis) and is highly cost-efficient (running costs of 0.5 Euro per analysis). For a fast protocol, application volumes up to 10 μL were selected although higher application volumes will lower still the LODs, which were 30 mg/kg for LL and LH as well as 4 mg/kg for citrinin. Thanks to the minimalistic sample preparation, the overall mean recovery rate was good (109.9% ± 5.9%; repeated measurements of the three analytes per fresh sample preparation at three spike levels). Repeated calibrations (five per analyte) in the red yeast rice matrix showed highly satisfying determination coefficients (≥ 0.9991; mean 0.9996). For three analytes at three concentration levels, the obtained mean intermediate precisions in red yeast rice matrix analyzed over the whole procedure including sample preparation were highly satisfying (≤ 2.6%).

31351384,"There is a rising public concern on accumulation of harmful pesticides in environment and crops. Epigenetic alteration caused by environmental contaminants is one of the key factors in the etiology of environmentally-associated diseases. Growing evidence shows that harmful pesticide atrazine (ATZ) has a profound effect on DNA methylation in human genome, however, little is known about the epigenetic mechanism underlying ATZ accumulation and degradation in plants, particularly in edible plants growing in the ATZ-contaminated areas. This study investigated the atrazine elimination that was mediated by DNA methylation and histone modification in the food crop rice. Studies with two mutant Osmet1-1/2 defective in the genomic CG DNA methylation show significantly lower accumulation of atrazine than its wild-types. Profiling methylome and transcriptome of ATZ-exposed Osmet1 and wild-type identified many differentially methylated loci (≥2 fold change, p < 0.05), which were associated with activation of genes responsible for atrazine degradation in plants. Three demethylated loci OsGTF, OsHPL1 and OsGLH were expressed in eukaryotic yeast cells and found to eliminate a marked proportion of ATZ in growth environments by 48%, 43% and 32%, respectively, whereas the increased ATZ-degraded products were characterized using UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS. These results suggest that activation of the loci mediated by ATZ-induced hypomethylation could be responsible for the removal of ATZ in rice.

31325809,"Methylmercury (MeHg) in rice grains grown in Hg-contaminated areas has raised environmental health concerns. Pot experiments found that selenium (Se) could reduce MeHg levels in rice grains. However, relatively high levels of Se (up to 6 mg/kg) were applied in these pot experiments, which may have adverse effects on the soil ecology due to the toxicity of Se. The aims of this work were thus to study 1) the effect of low levels of Se on the accumulation and distribution of Hg, especially MeHg, in rice plants grown in a real Hg-contaminated paddy field and 2) the effect of Se treatment on Se and other nutritional elements (e.g., Cu, Fe, Zn) in grains. A field study amended with different levels of Se was carried out in Hg-contaminated paddy soil in Qingzhen, Guizhou, China. The levels of MeHg and total Hg were studied using cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The distribution and relative quantification of elements in grains were examined by synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence analysis (SR-XRF). This field study showed that low levels of Se (0.5 μg/mL, corresponding to 0.15 mg Se/kg soils) could significantly reduce total Hg and MeHg in rice tissues. Se treatment also reduced Hg distribution in the embryo and endosperm and increased the levels of Fe, Cu, Zn and Se in grains and especially embryos. This field study implied that treatment with an appropriate level of Se is an effective approach to not only decrease the level of MeHg but to also increase the levels of nutritional elements such as Fe, Cu, Zn and Se in rice grains, which could bring beneficial effects for rice-dependent residents living in Hg-contaminated areas.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,"['D002681', 'D000072480', 'D008628', 'D008767', 'D012275', 'D012643', 'D012987', 'D012989']","['China', 'Farms', 'Mercury', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Oryza', 'Selenium', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants']",Selenium decreases methylmercury and increases nutritional elements in rice growing in mercury-contaminated farmland.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31325809,2019

In the present work, a novel approach for simultaneous analysis of EC and NAs in beer and yellow rice wine based on ice-bath assisted sodiumhydroxide purification and GC-MS/MS was firstly established. Samples were extracted with acetonitrile-ethyl acetate after addition of internal standards. The extraction solution system was purified by sodiumhydroxide solid under ice-bath. After concentration, target analytes were separated on a HP-INNOWAX quartz capillary column and determined under dynamic multiple reactions monitoring mode of MS/MS. The limits of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ), matrix effect, recovery and precision of the method were evaluated. Results were linear in the concentration range 2-200 μg/L for all analytes of interest, with regression coefficients higher than 0.999. LODs and LOQs were in the ranges of 0.1-0.5 μg/kg and 0.5-1.5 μg/kg, respectively. The mean recoveries at three spiked levels were between 81.5% and 121.0%. The intra- and inter-day precisions were in the ranges of 2.2-9.4% and 1.6-7.9%, respectively.

They are decomposition products of many emerging organic pollutants, such as tetrabromobisphenol A, polybrominated dibenzo- p-dioxin (PBDD), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), and others. To characterize their biotransformation pathways, bromophenol congener 2,4,6-tribromophenol, being used most frequently in the synthesis of brominated flame retardants and having the greatest environmental abundance, was selected to hydroponically expose rice plants. After exposure for 5 days, 99.2% of 2,4,6-tribromophenol was metabolized by rice. Because of the lack of relative reference standards, an effective screening strategy was used to screen for potential metabolites that were further qualitatively identified by gas and liquid chromatography combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Forty transformation products were confirmed or tentatively identified at different confidence levels, including 9 phase I and 31 phase II metabolites. A large number of metabolites (39) were found in rice root, and 10 of them could be translocated and detected in rice stems or leaves. Many transformation pathways were proposed, including debromination, hydroxylation, methylation, coupling reactions, sulfation, and glycosylation. It was remarkable that a total of seven hydrophobic, persistent, and toxic OH-PBDEs and PBDD/Fs were found, indicating the biotic dimeric reactions of 2,4,6-tribromophenol that occurred in the rice plants.

A total of 42 rice samples were collected from Hunan Province, a typical mine-impacted province in China. The bioaccessibility in the gastrointestinal tract was 71.7 ± 13.5% for the collected rice grains. Arsenite [As(III)] was the predominant As species in the simulated gastric and gastrointestinal solutions, followed by dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), arsenate [As(V)] and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA). The bioaccessible As(V) was irrelevant to As(V) in the rice grains, suggesting that interconversion between As(V) and other species was occurred in the simulated gastrointestinal tract. Monte-Carlo simulation was introduced to assess the health risk from exposure to inorganic As.

Molecular structural mechanisms for this inferior eating quality are found here using structural analysis by size-exclusion chromatography of both the parent starch and starch leached during cooking. All commonly-accepted sensory attributes of cooked rice were characterized by a trained human panel. Hardness, with the strongest negative correlation with panelist preference, was the dominant but not sole factor determining palatability. Hardness was controlled by the amounts of medium and long amylopectin chains and amylose in the starch, and by amylose content and amount of longer amylopectin chains in the leachate. This gives knowledge and understanding of the molecular structural characteristics of starch controlling cooked-rice preference: not just high amylose but also other aspects of molecular structure.

We evaluated the impact of the matrix effects on quantification of six neonicotinoid pesticides, acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam, in food by using deuterated internal standards. The calibration curves for each pesticide were obtained by using matrix-free and matrix-matched calibration solutions with blank brown rice, carrot, and green onion extracts. For brown rice and carrot, the matrix effects were not observed. In contrast, the slopes of calibration curves for each pesticide were influenced by presence of green onion extracts in calibration solutions (variability of the slopes was 4-9%), because the ratios of peak area for native pesticide to those for internal standards were influenced by matrix. The spike-and-recovery test with green onion was also performed. The analytical values obtained by using matrix-free calibration solution were biased from the spiked concentration, whereas those obtained by using matrix-matched calibration solution were comparable to the spiked concentration.

Diversified plant specialized metabolism relies on corresponding biosynthetic enzymes with differential substrate specificity. CYP71Z18 catalyzed formation of maize phytoalexins including zealexin A1, the sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin, and diterpenoid phytoalexin dolabralexin, indicating catalytic promiscuity on different terpene substrates. Here substrate specificity of CYP71Z18 was further explored through microbial metabolic engineering and it was identified to accept multiple rice diterpenes as substrates for oxidation. One CYP71Z18 enzymatic product derived from syn-pimaradiene was identified as 15,16-epoxy-syn-pimaradiene by NMR analysis, which was further elaborated by CYP99A3 to generate C19 hydroxylated product. 15,16-epoxy-syn-pimaradien-19-ol exhibited inhibitory effect on spore germination and appressorium formation of the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Overexpression of CYP71Z18 in rice resulted in accumulation of several new diterpenoids, indicating promiscuous activity in planta.

However, the occurrence of rice diseases has had a substantial impact on its yield. At present, chemical control is the main means of prevention and control of rice diseases. As a high-efficacy and broad-spectrum fungicide, prothioconazole shows an ideal effect on the prevention and control of common rice diseases, but the residuals that remain after its use may have an impact on human health. In this paper, ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used to develop a residue analysis method and explore the dissipation of prothioconazole and its metabolite prothioconazole-desthio in rice grain, rice husk, and rice plants, and the risks of chronic and acute dietary intake of prothioconazole in different Chinese populations were evaluated. The results showed that at a concentration range of 0.005-5.0 μg/mL, prothioconazole and its metabolites showed good linear correlations, and the correlation coefficients were all above 0.9992. The average recoveries of prothioconazole in three matrixes ranged from 80.0% to 99.7%, the RSD was between 1.54% and 11.0%, and the limit of quantitation was less than 0.01 μg/g. The sensitivity, accuracy, and precision of the established method all met the measurement requirements. The dissipation experimental results showed that the parent compound prothioconazole was rapidly metabolized to prothioconazole-desthio in the rice field environment, and the dissipation half-life in rice plants after application was 2.5-10.1 d.

31027538,"Non-targeted small molecule screening methods are used to analyze samples for potential compounds of interest without focusing on specific molecular species. There is great interest in these methods for metabolomic, environmental, forensic, and food safety applications, among others, to determine compounds that are responsible for a particular disease state or the presence of a harmful compound. In order for non-targeted analyses to become standardized and routine, best practices for sample preparation, data collection, and data analysis must be determined. This work focuses on optimizing specific aspects of a non-targeted workflow that utilizes high-resolution mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap instrument coupled to liquid chromatography. Sample preparation, liquid chromatography gradient length, and mass spectrometry resolving power and ionization modes were investigated to determine optimal conditions for detecting and extracting compounds from the data that cover broad molecular and polarity ranges. Infant rice cereal, orange juice, and yogurt with spiked standards were analyzed; food is inherently challenging to analyze due in part to sample complexity and diversity. Of the conditions tested, optimal conditions included a generic sample extraction using acetonitrile, water, and formic acid, a 25 min chromatographic gradient, collecting data in both positive and negative ion modes, and using 70 k resolving power. There are of course tradeoffs associated with each of these options that will be described in detail so that the appropriate conditions can be chosen for the desired application.",Analytica chimica acta,[],[],Optimized chemical coverage and data quality for non-targeted screening applications using liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027538,2019
31021021,"Sample preparation remains a bottleneck in the rapid and reliable quantification of gibberellins (GAs) for obtaining an insight into the physiological processes mediated by GAs. The challenges arise from not only the extremely low content of GAs in complex plant matrices, but the poor detectability of GAs by mass spectrometry (MS) in negative ion mode. In an effort to solve these urgent difficulties, we present a spatial-resolved analysis method to investigate the distribution of GAs in tiny plant tissues based on a simplified one-pot sample preparation approach coupled with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem MS. By integrating extraction and derivatization into one step, target GAs were effectively extracted from plant materials and simultaneously reacted with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide, the sample preparation time was largely shortened, the probability of sample loss was minimized and the detection sensitivity of MS was also greatly improved compared with underivatized GAs. Under optimal conditions, the method was validated from the quantification linearity, limits of detection and limits of quantification in the presence of plant matrices, recoveries, and precision. With the proposed method, 15 endogenous GAs were detected and, among these, 11 GAs could be quantified in 0.50 mg fresh weight (FW) wheat shoot samples, and five GAs were quantified in only 0.15 mg FW developing seed samples of Arabidopsis thaliana.

30986984,"The aim of this research is to demonstrate the concept and ability for the fast and preliminary screening of complex food and environmental samples for the presence of endocrine disrupters fractions, consisting of low-molecular mass micropollutants, particularly various bisphenols (A, B, C, E, F, S, Z, AF, AP, BP and FL). The developed analytical protocol for this research requires two main steps: (i) optimized solid phase extraction (SPE) for selective isolation, purification and pre-concentration of target fraction, and (ii) selective temperature-dependent inclusion chromatography for samples analysis via a HPLC-UV-VisDAD system using isocratic elution and internal standard quantification approach. The chromatographic experiment revealed that both β-CD and its hydroxypropyl derivative strongly interact with selected bisphenols. This is in contrast to the steroids and PAHs molecules investigated previously, where a strong interaction with β-cyclodextrin was observed. Integrated areas derived from acquired chromatographic profiles for each individual sample were used as the simple classification variable enabling samples comparison. We demonstrated that the proposed analytical protocol allows for fast estimation of EDC fractions in various daily use products, food and environmental samples. The materials of interest were selected due to the presence in surface water ecosystems of their residues, and finally, in raw wastewater including rice bags, plastic bags, cloths, sanitary towels, fish baits and various plastic foils from food products. Treated sewage water released directly to the environment from a municipal treatment plant (Jamno, Koszalin) was also investigated. It has been demonstrated that a whole range of low-molecular mass compounds, which may be detected using UV-Vis detector, can easily be emitted from various in daily use products. The presence of micropollutants in treated wastewater, water ecosystems and plastic waste utilization via technological wastewater treatment processes must be addressed, especially in terms of microplastic-based pollutants acting as endocrine disrupters. It is hoped that the proposed simple analytical protocol will be useful for fast sample classification or selection prior to advanced targeted analysis involving the more accurate quantification of specific analytes using e.g., mass spectrometry detectors.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D001559', 'D002845', 'D052244', 'D018857', 'D010636', 'D052616', 'D013696', 'D062065', 'D014874']","['Benzhydryl Compounds', 'Chromatography', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Food Packaging', 'Phenols', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Temperature', 'Waste Water', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']","Analysis of Selected Endocrine Disrupters Fraction Including Bisphenols Extracted from Daily Products, Food Packaging and Treated Wastewater Using Optimized Solid-Phase Extraction and Temperature-Dependent Inclusion Chromatography.","['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30986984,2019

30965265,"Inorganic arsenic (iAs) and total arsenic (tAs) were determined in common food from the Swedish market. Special focus was on rice, fish and shellfish products. For the speciation of iAs the European standard EN:16802 based on anion exchange chromatography coupled to ICP-MS was used. The two market basket food groups cereals (including rice), and sweets and condiments (a mixed group of sugar, sweets, tomato ketchup and dressings), contained the highest iAs levels (means 9 and 7 μg iAs/kg), whereas other food groups, including fish, did not exceed 2 μg iAs/kg. Varying levels of iAs were found in separate samples of tomato ketchup, 2.4-26 μg/kg, and is suggested to be one reason of the rather high average level of iAs in the food group sweets and condiments. Some specific food products revealed iAs levels much higher, i.e. rice crackers 152 and Norway lobster 89 μg iAs/kg. The intake of iAs via food was estimated by data from two national consumption surveys, performed in 2010-11 (1797 adults) and 2003 (2259 children). The estimated median iAs intakes in adults and children were 0.047 and 0.095 μg/kg body weight and day, respectively. The iAs intake for rice eaters was about 1.4 times higher than for non-rice eaters. Validation of the consumption survey-based iAs intake, using food purchase and market basket data mainly from 2015, resulted in a per capita intake of a similar magnitude, i.e. 0.056 μg/kg body weight and day.

As a result of this substantial production, the rice industry has a significant amount of side streams, including bran, representing millions of tons of raw materials mainly designated to animal feed. Rice bran is a rich source of γ-oryzanol, a bioactive compound with substantial health benefits. In this perspective, different bran rice samples from distinct germplasm origins (Philippines, Italy and Portugal) were studied for their γ-oryzanol content by HPLC-PDA, cytotoxicity in four human tumour cell lines, hepatotoxicity in a normal cell line and for their antimicrobial effects on different bacterial and fungal strains. The Ballatinao sample presented the strongest activity against all the tumour cell lines, and was also the sample showing the highest amount of γ-oryzanol, suggesting its contribution to the exhibited cytotoxic properties. Regarding the antimicrobial activity, the tested samples were able to inhibit the majority of bacterial and fungal strains, with the Portuguese Ceres sample being the one presenting the highest bacterial inhibition and the Maluit and Dinorado samples, the highest fungal inhibition.

As reports grow that frauds is prevalent in many supply chains there is the need for an effective and rapid technique for monitoring the authenticity and quality of rice. This study investigated the novel application of hand-held NIR spectrometry coupled to chemometric for the estimation of rice authenticity and quality in real time. A total of 520 rice samples from different quality grades (high quality, mid quality and low quality) and different countries (Ghana, Thailand, and Vietnam) of origin were used. Among the pre-processing methods used multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) was found to be superior. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract relevant information from the spectral data set and the results showed that rice samples of different categories could be clearly clustered under the first three PCs using the MSC preprocessing method. The performance of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) revealed that for authentication of rice quality grades, the classification rate gave 91.62% and 91.81% in training set and prediction set respectively while identification rate based on different country of origin was 90.84% and 90.64% in both training set and prediction set respectively. For the differentiation of local rice from the imported, KNN and SVM all had 100% in both the training set and prediction set. These gives very strong evidence that hand-held spectrometry coupled with MSC-PCA-KNN could successfully be used to provide rapid and nondestructive classification of rice samples according to different quality grades, geographical origin and imported versus locally produced rice. This technique could enhance the work of quality control inspectors both from industry and regulatory perspectives for the rapid detection of rice integrity and fraud issues.","Spectrochimica acta.

For development of suitable methods datasets of allergenic and nonallergenic (or low allergenic) proteins are required that can serve, respectively, as positive and negative controls. However, data are unavailable on proteins that lack or have low allergenic potential. Here, low allergenic potential proteins are identified based on the assumption that proteins with established human exposure, but with a lack of an association with allergy, possess low allergenic potential. Proteins were extracted from sources considered to have less allergenic potential (corn, potato, spinach, rice, and tomato) as well as higher allergenic potential (wheat) regarding common allergenic foods. Proteins were identified and semi-quantified by label-free proteomic analysis conducted using mass spectrometry.

30810038,"2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) is a key odorant in many foods, such as aromatic rice and wheat bread, with a very low odor threshold of 0.05 μg/L in water. The small molecule with a popcornlike, roasty odor is generated biologically or by Strecker degradation within the Maillard-reaction cascades during thermal food processing with methylglyoxal and 1-pyrroline as the main direct precursors. Numerous gas-chromatographic methods for the analysis of 2-AP have been published, but the reactivity of the compound leads to discrimination or degradation during sample workup. We developed a novel derivatization method for 2-AP with o-phenylenediamine followed by HPLC-MS/MS analysis of the resulting stable quinoxaline.

Using in vitro antioxidant evaluation and phenolic compounds analysis, fermentation with Fu brick tea increased the total phenolic content and enhanced the antioxidant activity of glutinous rice, including scavenging of 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical, 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical, and hydroxyl radical, ferric-reducing antioxidant power, and ferric ion reducing power and iron chelating capability. Besides, compared with traditional fermented glutinous rice, this novel functional food exhibited a stronger activity for protecting DNA against hydroxyl radical-induced oxidation damage. Quantitative analysis by HPLC identified 14 compounds covering catechins and phenolic acids, which were considered to be positively related to the enhanced antioxidant capability. Furthermore, we found that 80% ethanol was a suitable extract solvent compared with water, because of its higher extraction efficiency and stronger functional activities.

Correspondingly, the fatty acid content of the rice significantly increased during storage. Lipid oxidation was also accelerated under HT-HH conditions leading to the formation of peroxides. However, catalase activity was reduced under these conditions promoting the accumulation of peroxides. For the first time, insights into the genetic mechanisms responsible for these changes were obtained using RNA-sequencing to establish the flavor metabolic pathways in rice. Under HT-HH conditions, gene expression of lipase increased while that of catalase decreased, leading to faster hydrolysis and oxidation of the rice lipids.

In Korea, rice paddy fields are often located around industrial complexes, a major anthropogenic source of metals. In this study, rice paddy soils were collected from 50 sites in three industrial cities to investigate the contamination characteristics and ecological risk of metals in the soils. The cities studied and their major industries are as follows: Ulsan (petrochemical, nonferrous, automobile, and shipbuilding), Pohang (iron and steel), and Gwangyang (iron and steel, nonmetallic, and petrochemical). Thirteen metals (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The mean concentration of Cd (1.98 mg/kg) exceeded the soil quality guideline of Canada (1.4 mg/kg), whereas concentrations of other metals were under the standards of both Korea and Canada. Generally, levels of metal concentrations decreased with increasing distance from industrial complexes. Among the three cities, Pohang showed high concentrations of Zn (142.2 mg/kg), and Ulsan and Gwangyang showed high concentrations of Cr (33.9 mg/kg) and Ba (126.4 mg/kg), respectively. These contamination patterns were influenced by the different major industries of each city, which was clearly demonstrated by the principal component analysis results.

To address this shortcoming, we completed a 3-day duplicate diet study for 104 children and 101 pregnant women in two cities, Shimotsuke, Tochigi and Asahikawa, Hokkaido. The levels of intake of total and inorganic arsenic were estimated using the concentrations of total and inorganic arsenic in food and drinking water measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Estimated intakes of total and inorganic arsenic were 8.46 ± 3.02 [µg/kg BW/week] and 1.74 ± 1.07 [µg/kg BW/week] in pregnant women and 20.07 ± 3.53 [µg/kg BW/week] and 8.46 ± 3.02 [µg/kg BW/week] in children, respectively. Weekly arsenic exposure per kg body weight was significantly higher in children than in pregnant women. Concentrations of total arsenic were generally very low in collected drinking water samples with a small number of exceptions, and drinking water was not considered as a major source of inorganic arsenic exposure in Japan. We found that total and inorganic arsenic intake were higher among frequent consumers of hijiki seaweed, in both pregnant women and children. Although rice and rice products that are staple foods of the Japanese have been reported to be major sources of inorganic arsenic exposure in Japan, our results indicate that hijiki consumption elevates levels of inorganic arsenic in Japanese children and pregnant women.

30579642,"The performance of particulate layers of a smaller particle size than given HPTLC plates was investigated. However, reducing the particle size and thus interporous space, the capillary flow is substantially reduced. For the first time, optimizations led to the successful use of a layer made of mainly 4-μm irregular silica gel particles as stationary phase in planar chromatography. Layer thicknesses of 50 and 70 μm were studied to suit especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC). Along with it, the chromatographic fingerprint was miniaturized by 75%. The required development time and developing distance were reduced up to 50%. A typical 35-mm separation took less than 10 min. The limit of detection was improved by a factor of up to 3. Further chromatographic performance data, such as separation number (peak capacity), resolution and analytical response proved the suitability of the particulate UTLC layer. A direct transferability and miniaturization of established HPTLC methods to the UTLC dimension was aimed at. This was successfully demonstrated for eight quite different separations, i.e. food dyes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, steviol glycosides in cough drops and sweetener tablets, preservatives in shrimp-surimi salad, gingerol in ginger-containing products, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in honey, tanshinones in Salvia miltiorriza extracts and monacolin K in fermented red rice food supplements. The direct method transfer, mainstream usability and fast analyses at low running costs are crucial features of the developed UTLC plate. Profiting from such advantages, the miniaturized fingerprint shows potential to shift the field of HPTLC towards UTLC.

30466136,"Zearalenone (ZEA) is a toxic metabolite of Fusarium genera that frequently contaminates cereal grains. India being a tropical country provides suitable conditions for fungal invasion to the cereals. In the absence of any regulatory limits for ZEA in India, the present study was carried out to analyze the contamination levels of ZEA in different cereal samples consumed by Indian population and its exposure assessment through intake. Out of 117 cereal samples comprising of wheat, rice, corn, and oats, 70 (84%) were found to be positive for ZEA contamination, among which 24 (33%) samples exceeded the permissible limits proposed by European Union when analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The positive samples were further validated by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS) analysis. Based on the quantitative estimation of ZEA contamination in cereals and their daily consumption values, the probable daily intake of ZEA was found to be 16.9- and 7.9-fold higher in rice and wheat samples, respectively, than the tolerable daily intake prescribed by European Food Safety Authority. The presence of ZEA at high levels indicates a higher exposure risk for Indian population as wheat and rice are staple foods in India. Thus, there is an immediate need to set the permissible levels of ZEA in India to safeguard the health of 1.34 billion people.

The study will help the Indian regulatory bodies to set the permissible level of ZEA in different cereal grains so as to safeguard the health of common masses.

30453737,"Hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs), diversely distributed secondary metabolites in plants, play essential roles in plant growth and developmental processes. Most current approaches can be used to analyze a few known HCAAs in a given plant. A novel method for comprehensive detection of plant HCAAs is urgently needed. In this study, a deep annotation method of HCAAs was proposed on the basis of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) and its in silico database of HCAAs. To construct an in silico UHPLC-HRMS HCAAs database, a total of 846 HCAAs were generated from the most common phenolic acid and polyamine/aromatic monoamine substrates according to possible biosynthesis reactions, which represent the structures of plant-specialized HCAAs. The characteristic MS/MS fragmentation patterns of HCAAs were extracted from reference mixtures. Four quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) models were developed to predict retention times of mono-trans-HCAAs (aromatic amines conjugates), mono-trans-HCAAs (aliphatic amines conjugates), bis-HCAAs, and tris-HCAAs. The developed method was applied for identifying HCAAs in seeds (maize, wheat, and rice), roots (rice), and leaves (rice and tobacco). A total of 79 HCAAs were detected: 42 of them were identified in these plants for the first time, and 20 of them have never been reported to exist in plants. The results showed that the developed method can be used to identify HCAAs in a plant without prior knowledge of HCAA distributions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first UHPLC-HRMS database developed for effective deep annotation of HCAAs from nontargeted UHPLC-HRMS data. It is useful for the identification of novel HCAAs in plants.",Analytical chemistry,"['D000577', 'D002851', 'D003198', 'D003373', 'D016208', 'D010944', 'D053719']","['Amides', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Databases, Factual', 'Plants', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Deep Annotation of Hydroxycinnamic Acid Amides in Plants Based on Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry and Its In Silico Database.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None]","['analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30453737,2019

Fifty-four volatiles were identified, 15 of which were not previously identified in black rice, including 4-propylbenzaldehyde, methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate, methyl 2-methylpentanoate, 2,5-dimethylnonane, 5-methyldecane, and 2-methylundecane. In this study, octanal increased at a high rate during early storage compared with hexanal, a traditional oxidation marker; thus, octanal may be an early oxidation marker in black rice. The results suggested that high temperature is not appropriate for storage of unmilled or milled black rice because it promotes lipid oxidation, producing volatile compounds.

We present a modified setup of the human simulator of the gut microbial ecosystem (SHIME), with four sequential gastrointestinal reactors (oral, stomach, small intestine, and colon), including the salivary and colonic microbiomes. Naturally arsenic-containing rice, mussels, and nori seaweed were digested in the presence of microorganisms and in vitro oral bioaccessibility, bioavailability, and metabolism of arsenic species were evaluated following analysis by using HPLC/mass spectrometry. When food matrices were digested with salivary bacteria, the soluble arsenic in the gastric digestion stage increased for mussel and nori samples, but no coincidence impact was found in the small intestinal and colonic digestion stages. However, the simulated small intestinal absorption of arsenic was increased in all food matrices (1.2-2.7 fold higher) following digestion with salivary microorganisms. No significant transformation of the arsenic species occurred except for the arsenosugars present in mussels and nori. In those samples, conversions between the oxo arsenosugars were observed in the small intestinal digestion stage whereupon the thioxo analogs became major metabolites.

By combining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescent microscopy (FM), we showed that U. esculenta hyphal morphological transitions and movement occurred both intercellularly and intracellularly while sporulation occurred intracellularly in selective cells. Following proteome profiling using two dimensional SDS-PAGE at different phenological phases of smut-gall development and U. esculenta infection, differentially expressed proteins bands and their relative abundance were detected and subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Importantly, the fungus explores at least 7 metabolic pathways and 5 major biological processes to subdue the host defense and thrive successfully on Z. latifolia. The fungus U. esculenta produces proteases and energy acquisition proteins those enhance it's defensive and survival mode in the host. The identified differentially regulated proteins shed-light into why inflorescence is being replaced by bulbous smut-gall at late stages of the disease, as well as the development of resistance in some Z. latifolia plants against U. esculenta infection.",Microbial pathogenesis,"['D005656', 'D015870', 'D020869', 'D063990', 'D054884', 'D025301', 'D007194', 'D053858', 'D010935', 'D010941', 'D006109', 'D040901', 'D014588']","['Fungal Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Ontology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Hyphae', 'India', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Plant Diseases', 'Plant Tumors', 'Poaceae', 'Proteomics', 'Ustilago']",Cellular and proteomic events associated with the localized formation of smut-gall during Zizania latifolia-Ustilago esculenta interaction.,"['Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000382', 'Q000382', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235']","['metabolism', None, None, None, 'genetics', 'cytology', None, 'genetics', 'microbiology', 'microbiology', 'genetics', None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30367966,2019
30366537,"Starch molecular fine structure can have significant effects on pasting and thermal properties of rice flour. This study investigates the mechanistic explanation of these effects, by obtaining data for rice flour with different starch fine structures. Starch structural parameters for both amylose and amylopectin were obtained using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, a type of gel-permeation chromatography, GPC), and the data fitted with methodologies (one of which is new) based on the underlying biosynthetic processes. It is found that the setback viscosity of rice starch measured by the rapid viscosity analyzer (RVA) depends not only on amylose content but also on the amount of long amylose chains and the size of whole amylopectin molecules. Conversely, long amylose chains and large amylopectin molecules are found to be responsible for the lower peak and trough viscosities. Other results for the effects of amylopectin chains are consistent with the literature. Mechanistic explanations for all observations are put forward. The novel findings about the influence of the distribution of amylose chain lengths and whole amylopectin size, in addition to amylose content alone, can provide guidance for rice breeders and food scientists in the selection of rices with improved functional properties.",Carbohydrate polymers,[],[],How amylose molecular fine structure of rice starch affects functional properties.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30366537,2018

30299556,"Characterization of the melatonin (MLT) biosynthesis pathway in plants is still limited. Additionally, a metabolomic analysis of MLT biosynthesis in plants is still a challenge due to analyte structural and chemical diversity, low analyte abundances, and plant matrix complexities. Herein, a sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method enabling the simultaneous determination of seven plant MLT biosynthetic metabolites was developed. In the proposed strategy, the targeted metabolites, which included tryptophan (Trp), tryptamine (TAM), 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP), serotonin (5HT), N-acetylserotonin (NAS), 5-methoxytryptamine (5MT), and MLT, were purified from plant extracts using a one-step dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE). The samples were then chemically labeled with dansyl chloride (DNS-Cl), followed by analysis using LC-MS. The limit of detection (LOD) values ranged from 0.03 to 1.36 pg/mL and presented a 22- to 469-fold decrease when compared to the unlabeled metabolites. Due to the high sensitivity of the proposed method, the consumption of plant materials was reduced to 10 mg FW. Ultimately, the established method was utilized to examine the distributions of MLT and its intermediates in rice shoots and roots with or without cadmium (Cd) stress. The results suggested that under normal condition, MLT may also be generated via a Trp/TAM/5HT/5MT/MLT path (Pathway II) in addition to the previously reported Trp/TAM/5HT/NAS/MLT path (Pathway I), although Pathway I was shown to be dominant.

30071224,"Metal-binding proteins play an important role in maintaining intracellular metal homeostasis and eliminating heavy metal toxification. Many metallothioneins (MTs) have been isolated from mammalian sources, which are a family of low molecular weight metal-binding proteins that are rich in cysteine. However, plants contain a different type of cadmium-binding protein that contain fewer cysteine residues. In this study, cadmium affinity chromatography coupled with laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has been used to separate and identify cadmium-binding proteins from different parts (root, stem, leaf and grain) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivated under cadmium stress conditions. Seven cadmium-binding proteins with low isoelectric points containing relatively few cysteine residues were chosen for expression in Escherichia coli. The cadmium removal efficiency of protein A3AGZ4 (OsJ_10480) from Escherichia coli △zntA-BL21 was the highest (57.35%), which compares favorably with the cadmium removal efficiency of metallothionein MT (48.99%, mt from mouse,) and SMT (55.84%, smt from Sinopotamon honanense). In addition, for the strain A3AGZ4-△zntA-BL21, most of the bound cadmium was found to accumulate in the cytoplasm and not the cell wall.

30029381,"A sample treatment technique based on a duel frequency ultrasonic device for enzymatic digestion of rice is reported. The ultrasonic device combines a high intensity ultrasonic probe and the temperature control function of ultrasonic water bath, which can effectively extract cadmium from rice within only 160 s under the optimized conditions. Compared with the traditional ultrasonic assisted enzymatic digestion, the new method not only shortens the time significantly (e.g., from the 90 min of ultrasonic water bath to the present few minutes), but also increases the extraction efficiency of cadmium (such as ~ 75% from ultrasonic probe to app. 100%). Through the optimization of ultrasonic mode, ultrasonic frequency, power and the type of enzyme, we found that enzyme played a dominant role in ultrasound assisted enzymatic digestion. Compared with a-amylase and pepsin, trypsin is more suitable for the extraction of cadmium from rice. Furthermore, ultrasound energy is beneficial to enzymatic hydrolysis of bimolecular, and this promotion is related to the frequency of ultrasound. The reliability of this method was evaluated by analyzing the content of cadmium in the certified reference materials (CRMs, GBW10045, GBW08510, GBW08511 and GBW08512) based on atomic fluorescence spectrometry combined with a modified chemical vapor generation.

Comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC) appears as a promising alternative to overcome this drawback. Unfortunately, this approach generates highly complex datasets which untargeted analysis is challenging. In this work, a global methodological strategy combining LC × LC-MS/MS with chemometric data analysis is proposed for untargeted lipidomic studies. The feasibility of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by its application to assess the effects of arsenic exposure on the lipidome of growing rice samples. A two-dimensional chromatographic setup coupling reversed phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) modes together with a triple quadrupole mass detector (TQD) is proposed to analyze lipid extracts from rice samples at different experimental conditions. Chemometric tools were used for data compression, spectral and elution profiles resolution, feature detection and statistical analysis of the multidimensional LC × LC-MS/MS data.

29729608,"Seed storability is an important trait for crop breeding, however, the mechanism underlying seed storability remains largely unknown. Here, a mass spectrometry-based comparative metabolomic study was performed for rice seeds before and after 24-month natural storage between two hybrid rice cultivars, IIYou 998 (IIY) with low storability and BoYou 998 (BY) with relative high storability. A total of 48 metabolites among 90 metabolite peaks detected were conclusively identified, and most of them are involved in the primary metabolism. During the 24-month storage, 19 metabolites with significant changes in abundance were found in the storage-sensitive IIY seeds, but only 8 in the BY seeds, most of which are free amino acids and soluble sugars. The observed changes of the metabolites in IIY seeds that are consistent with our protoemics results are likely to be involved in its sensitivity to storage. Levels of all identified 18 amino acid-related metabolites and most sugar-related metabolites were significantly higher in IIY seeds both before and after storage. However the level of raffinose was lower in IIY seeds before and after storage, and did not change significantly throughout the storage period in both two cultivars, suggesting its potential role in seed storability.

Thus, EU regulation was recently modified to include phthalimide in the folpet residue definition. However, recent studies have shown that phthalimide could also be generated from different sources, which could lead to an overestimation of the phthalimide content and therefore to false positives. GC coupled with either negative chemical ionisation and single quadrupole mass spectrometry, or electron ionisation with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS/MS), were evaluated for the determination of folpet and phthalimide in food. Both methods were validated in 4 different matrices namely apple puree, rice flour, raspberry puree and infant formula. Better selectivity and precision were obtained with GC-EI-MS/MS.

The method is based on extraction with MeOH-water (70 + 30, v/v) and cleanup with two multiantibody IMA columns. For corn and rice spiked at low mycotoxin levels, a significant matrix effect was observed and was compensated by using 13C calibration. At higher mycotoxin levels (medium and high), matrix effects were negligible as no significant differences were observed for the majority of recovery results calculated by 13C calibration and external calibration.

Plasma amino acids&rsquo; concentrations were measured using an HPLC (High-performance liquid chromatography) method with fluorimetric detection. Plasmatic TRP concentrations showed no significant difference between M1, M2 and M3 samples at any sampling time. M2 led to a decrease in 5LNAAs levels and consequently led to a significant higher TRP/5LNAAs ratios in the 6 h period after the provision of carbohydrates, compared to both M1 and M3. In addition, the mean TRP/5LNAAs ratio was significantly higher in M2 than in M3 at t8 and t10.

A large level of genetic diversity for anthocyanin content and composition in the grain of different species was observed. In rye, recessive mutations in six genes (vi1...vi6) lead to the absence of anthocyanins in all parts of the plant. Moreover, dominant genes of anthocyanin synthesis in aleurone (gene C) and pericarp (gene Vs) also affect the color of the grain. Reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to study anthocyanins in 24 rye samples. A lack of anthocyanins in the lines with yellow and brown grain was determined. Delphinidin rutinoside and cyanidin rutinoside were found in the green-seeded lines. Six samples with violet grains significantly varied in terms of anthocyanin composition and content. However, the main aglycone was cyanidin or peonidin in all of them. Monosaccharide glucose and disaccharide rutinose served as the glycoside units. Violet-seeded accession forms differ in the ratio of the main anthocyanins and the range of their acylated derivatives. The acyl groups were presented mainly by radicals of malonic and sinapic acids. For the colored forms, a profile of the revealed anthocyanins with the indication of their contents was given.

29669203,"Bacterial infections of agriculturally important mushrooms and plants pose a major threat to human food sources worldwide. However, structures of chemical mediators required by the pathogen for host colonization and infection remain elusive in most cases. Here, we report two types of threonine-tagged lipopeptides conserved among mushroom and rice pathogenic Burkholderia species that facilitate bacterial infection of hosts. Genome mining, metabolic profiling of infected mushrooms, and heterologous expression of orphan gene clusters allowed the discovery of these unprecedented metabolites in the mushroom pathogen Burkholderia gladioli (haereogladin, burriogladin) and the plant pathogen Burkholderia glumae (haereoglumin and burrioglumin). Through targeted gene deletions, the molecular basis of lipopeptide biosynthesis by nonribosomal peptide synthetases was revealed. Surprisingly, both types of lipopeptides feature unusual threonine tags, which yield longer peptide backbones than one would expect based on the canonical colinearity of the NRPS assembly lines. Both peptides play an indirect role in host infection as biosurfactants that enable host colonization by mediating swarming and biofilm formation abilities. Moreover, MALDI imaging mass spectrometry was applied to investigate the biological role of the lipopeptides.

The humic fraction refers to the humic substances (HS) and consists of humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and humins, according to solubility in aqueous solution. The physical and chemical characteristics of HA, FA, and humins depend on many factors, among which is the type of original organic material. Two processes for the stabilization of organic materials are known worldwide: composting and vermicomposting. Cattle manure, rice straw, sugarcane bagasse, and vegetable wastes from leaves were the organic residues chosen for the composting and vermicomposting processes. In this study, the differences between the HS extracted from such composted and vermicomposted residues were evaluated. The so-extracted HS were evaluated by spectroscopy in the regions of infrared and ultraviolet-visible, and pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection is applied. Thus, we expect that the results obtained here indicate which of the two processes is more efficient in the biotransformation of organic residues in a short period with respect to the HS content. It was also observed that the basic units of the humic fractions generated (although they presented different degrees of maturation) are the same. Altogether, the data reported here bring to light that the structures of the HS are very similar, differing in quantities. These results can still be extrapolated to several other raw materials, since the most variable organic matrices were used here to allow this data extrapolation.

In this study, the concentration of cadmium in various types of food collected from 2013 to 2015 were analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, and the dietary exposure to cadmium assessed based on a dietary survey in 2976 Guangzhou residents. In total, 3074 out of 4039 food samples had cadmium levels above the limit of detection. The mean ± standard deviation (50th, 95th percentile) cadmium content in all samples was 159.0 ± 112.7 (8.6, 392.4) μg/kg, with levels ranging from 1.0 to 7830 μg/kg. Using the mean cadmium concentrations, the average monthly dietary exposure of Guangzhou residents to cadmium was 14.4 (μg/kg body weight (BW), accounting for 57.6% of the provisional tolerable monthly intake (PTMI). Rice, laver, vegetables, and live aquatic products were the main sources of cadmium intake, on average accounting for 89% of the total value. The dietary cadmium exposure in high consumers (95th percentile food consumption) was 41.0 μg/kg·BW/month, accounting for 163% of the PTMI. Additionally, dietary cadmium exposure at mean consumption but high cadmium food concentration (95th percentile) was 32.3 μg/kg·BW/month, corresponding to 129% of the PTMI.

Therefore, an in situ effective method for As risk evaluation in paddy soil is strongly needed to avoid As exposure through rice ingestion. Herein, we developed a rapid analytical methodology for determination of As in plant tissues using field portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (FP-XRF). This method was applied to rice roots in order to evaluate the As contamination in paddy soils. The results showed that rice roots with iron plaques were superior to rhizosphere soils for generating FP-XRF signals, especially for field sites with As concentrations lower than the soil detection limit of FP-XRF (30.0mg/kg). Moreover, the strong linear relationships of As concentrations between the rice roots and corresponding leaves and grains proved that the rice root, rather than the soil, is a better predictor of As concentrations in rice grains.

Contaminated soil was treated with NSF in the range of 0-10 wt% and CSF in the range of 0-5 wt% and cured for 28 days. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) test was used to evaluate effectiveness of starfish treatment. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analyses were conducted to investigate the mechanism responsible for effective immobilization of Pb and Zn. Experimental results suggest that NSF and CSF treatments effectively immobilize Pb and Zn in treated rice paddy soil. TCLP levels for Pb and Zn were reduced with increasing NSF and CSF dosage. Comparison of the two treatment methods reveals that CSF treatment is more effective than NSF treatment. Leachability of the two metals is reduced approximately 58% for Pb and 51% for Zn, upon 10 wt% NSF treatment. More pronounced leachability reductions, 93% for Pb and 76% for Zn, are achieved upon treatment with 5 wt% CSF. Sequential extraction results reveal that NSF and CSF treatments of contaminated soil generated decrease in exchangeable/weak acid Pb and Zn soluble fractions, and increase of residual Pb and Zn fractions. Results for the SEM-EDX sample treated with 5 wt% CSF indicate that effective Pb and Zn immobilization is most probably associated with calcium silicate hydrates (CSHs) and calcium aluminum hydrates (CAHs).",Chemosphere,"['D000818', 'D007854', 'D019216', 'D012275', 'D012987', 'D012989', 'D013052', 'D013215', 'D015032']","['Animals', 'Lead', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Oryza', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission', 'Starfish', 'Zinc']",Stabilization of lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) in contaminated rice paddy soil using starfish: A preliminary study.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29453073,2018

An ion chromatography-inductively coupled-plasma-mass spectroscopy method was developed to separate the four following arsenic anions: As(III), As(V), MMA(V) and DMA(V). Sample preparation was done in mild acidic conditions to ensure species preservation. The predominant arsenic species found in rice and rice-based products, except for rice drinks, was As(III), with 60-80% of the total As content, followed by DMA(V) and As(V). MMA(V) was measured only at low levels (<3%).

However, as these elements are increasing in the environment due to fast urbanization, industrialization, and chemicalized agricultural activities, accumulation of the same in human body anywhere in the world is quite interesting to global assessment of environment quality. In this connection, random examination of blood samples of human population in Kerala, South India, was carried out to assess the threat of heavy metal contamination to humans in this part of the globe, especially in relation to the amount of such metals in food and other environmental samples. Except pure vegetarians, people of Kerala consume rice as the staple food with a lot of fish. Therefore, the amount of these three heavy metals in drinking water, fish, rice, and paddy soils was done. Heavy metals in the blood were examined in relation to age, gender, and dietary habits such as frequency of fish eating or vegetarianism. Influence of dental amalgam fillings on blood mercury levels was also analyzed. Quantitative assessment of metals in samples was done by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The levels of arsenic, lead, and mercury were found well below the reference values, though diet seemed to pull them up as the amount of metals in blood showed significant differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians.

The content of selenium (Se) and toxic trace elements, including aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and tin (Sn), in crop samples was assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry after microwave digestion of the samples. The obtained data demonstrate that cultivation of crops on seleniferous soils significantly increased Se level in wheat, mustard, rice, and maize by a factor of more than 590, 111, 85, and 64, respectively. The study also showed that Se exposure affected toxic metal content in crops. In particular, Se-rich wheat was characterized by a significant decrease in Al, As, Ni, Pb, and Sn levels. The level of As, Cd, Ni, Pb, and Sn was significantly decreased in Se-rich rice, whereas As content was increased. In turn, the decrease in Al, As, Cd, Ni, Pb, and Sn levels in Se-rich maize was associated with a significant elevation of Hg content. Finally, Se-rich mustard was characterized by a significant increase in Al, As, and Hg levels, while the content of Ni, Pb, and Sn was significantly lower than the control levels.

In this study, we observed the hydrolyzing activity of a fungus-inducible pepper carboxylesterase (PepEST) on cell walls of C. gloeosporioides, causing growth retardation of the fungus by blocking appressorium formation. To determine the cellular basis for the growth inhibition, we observed the localization of PepEST on the fungus and found the attachment of the protein on surfaces of conidia and germination tubes. Moreover, we examined the decomposition of cell-wall materials from the fungal surface after reaction with PepEST, which led to the identification of 1,2-dithiane-4,5-diol (DTD) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Exogenous DTD treatment did not elicit expression of defense-related genes in the host plant but did trigger the necrosis of C. gloeosporioides. Furthermore, the DTD compound displayed protective effects on pepper fruits and plants against C. gloeosporioides and C. coccodes, respectively. In addition, DTD was also effective in preventing other diseases, such as rice blast, tomato late blight, and wheat leaf rust.

In addition, to assess the probability of the targeted delivery of liposome encapsulation of the peptide to Listeria biofilm, Alpep7-loaded liposomes were further prepared from a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, stearylamine and cholesterol in a molar ratio of 10 : 3 : 2 and characterised by the analysis of particle size, zeta potential, microtopography and storage stability. The results showed that the liposomes exhibited a well-defined spherical shape, with an average diameter below 200 nm. The liposomes maintained favourable stability after storage at 4 °C for 4 weeks. Comparisons between the activities of free and liposomal Alpep7 via microbroth dilution, regrowth analysis and confocal scanning laser microscopy suggested that liposomal delivery was more effective during the initial exposure of the liposomes to the biofilms. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption of liposomal Alpep7 to the listerial biofilm was a spontaneous, exothermic process.

However, organic rice presented greater total carbohydrates, soluble protein, amylose content, 33% greater free phenolics, and phenolic acids, but exhibited a greater percentage of stained grains during the storage period. The free phenolic content of cooked rice was lower than the free phenolic content of the raw rice.

Random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) with a radial basis function kernel, C5.0, model averaged neural network, and k-nearest neighbor classifiers were used for the classification. We achieved desired results, and the classifiers effectively differentiated white rice from Korea to blended samples with high prediction accuracy for the contamination ratio as low as five percent. In addition, RF and SVM classifiers were generally superior to and more robust than the other techniques.

Understanding the regulatory mechanism for ATZ metabolism and degradation in plants is important to help reduce ATZ potential toxicity to both plants and human health. Here, we report our newly developed engineered rice overexpressing a novel Phase II metabolic enzyme glycosyltransfearse1 (ARGT1) responsible for transformation of ATZ residues in rice. Our results showed that transformed lines, when exposed to environmentally realistic ATZ concentration (0.2-0.8 mg/L), displayed significantly high tolerance, with 8-27% biomass and 36-56% chlorophyll content higher, but 37-69% plasma membrane injury lower than untransformed lines. Such results were well confirmed by ARGT1 expression in Arabidopsis. ARGT1-transformed rice took up 1.6-2.7 fold ATZ from its growth medium compared to its wild type (WT) and accumulated ATZ 10%-43% less than that of WT. A long-term study also showed that ATZ in the grains of ARGT1-transformed rice was reduced by 30-40% compared to WT. The ATZ-degraded products were characterized by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS. More ATZ metabolites and conjugates accumulated in ARGT1-transformed rice than in WT. Eight ATZ metabolites for Phase I reaction and 10 conjugates for Phase II reaction in rice were identified, with three ATZ-glycosylated conjugates that have never been reported before.

In the present study, the design, synthesis, qualitative and quantitative performance of non-derivative ionic liquid matrices (ILMs) were reported. DHB/N-methylaniline (N-MA) and DHB/N-ethylaniline (N-EA), performing best for carbohydrate detection, have been screened out. The limit of detection for oligosaccharide provided by DHB/N-MA and DHB/N-EA were as low as 10 fmol. DHB/N-MA and DHB/N-EA showed significantly higher ion generation efficiency than DHB. The comparison of capacity to probe polysaccharide between these two ILMs and DHB also revealed their powerful potential.

However, there is still lack of a high-throughput method for rapidly and reproducibly differentiating the geographical origins of commercial white rice. In this study, we developed a method that employed lipidomics and deep learning to discriminate white rice from Korea to China. A total of 126 white rice of 30 cultivars from different regions were utilized for the method development and validation. By using direct infusion-mass spectrometry-based targeted lipidomics, 17 lysoglycerophospholipids were simultaneously characterized within minutes per sample. Unsupervised data exploration showed a noticeable overlap of white rice between two countries. In addition, lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs) were prominent in white rice from Korea while lysophosphatidylethanolamines (lysoPEs) were enriched in white rice from China. A deep learning prediction model was built using 2014 white rice and validated using two different batches of 2015 white rice. The model accurately discriminated white rice from two countries. Among 10 selected predictors, lysoPC(18:2), lysoPC(14:0), and lysoPE(16:0) were the three most important features.

To understand the effects and roles of F. graminearum mycotoxins on maize seedling blight occurring at Zhang Ye of Gansu, China, 23 isolates of F. graminearum were collected and characterized. A PCR assay showed all 23 isolates belonged to the 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON) genotype. This was also confirmed by production of both DON and 15-ADON in either rice culture medium or maize seedling roots, detected by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In maize seedling roots, 15-ADON dominated at 6 days post inoculation (dpi) and DON was the main mycotoxin at 12 dpi. The biomass of F. graminearum doubled from 6 to 12 dpi, and was positively correlated with virulence of the isolates. Both mycotoxins affected maize root vitality, but 15-ADON had a greater effect than DON. ALDH9 and MDH, two dehydrogenase synthesis genes in maize, showed a lower relative expression in 15-ADON treatments than in DON treatments. It indicated that both mycotoxins affected seed germination and root development, with 15-ADON being more destructive. Under scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, root hair formation and development were delayed by DON, but completely inhibited by 15-ADON. 15-ADON caused cell shrinkage, loose cellular structure, and widened intercellular spaces; it also destroyed organelles and caused plasmolysis, and eventually ruptured cell membranes causing cell death. DON did not affect cell morphology and arrangement, but altered the morphology of organelles, forming concentric membranous bodies and a large amount of irregular lipid droplets.

In all, nineteen CRC survivors participated in a parallel randomised controlled dietary intervention trial that included daily consumption of study-provided foods with heat-stabilised RB (30 g/d) or no additional ingredient (control). Stool samples were collected at baseline and 4 weeks and analysed using GC-MS and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-MS. Stool metabolomics revealed 93 significantly different metabolites in individuals consuming RB. A 264-fold increase in β-hydroxyisovaleroylcarnitine and 18-fold increase in β-hydroxyisovalerate exemplified changes in leucine, isoleucine and valine metabolism in the RB group. A total of thirty-nine stool metabolites were significantly different between RB and control groups, including increased hesperidin (28-fold) and narirutin (14-fold).

Urinary arsenosugars and their metabolites (including dimethyl arsenate (DMA), thio-dimethylarsinoylethanol (thio-DMAE), thio-dimethylarsinoylacetate (thio-DMAA), and thio-DMA) were measured in spot urine samples prior to seaweed consumption, and in 24-hour urine samples while consuming seaweed. Commercial products made from whole seaweed had substantial concentrations of arsenic (12-84 µg/g), dominated by arsenosugars. Intact arsenosugars along with DMA, thio-DMAA, thio-DMAE all increased in urine after ingesting each type of seaweed, and varied between seaweed types and between individuals. Only trace levels of the known toxic metabolite, thio-DMA, were observed, across individuals. Thio-DMAE and thio-DMAA are unique products of arsenosugar breakdown, thus assessment of these compounds may help to identify dietary intake of arsenic from seaweed from other exposure pathways.",Scientific reports,"['D000328', 'D001149', 'D001152', 'D002851', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D008875', 'D009005', 'D012624']","['Adult', 'Arsenates', 'Arsenicals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosaccharides', 'Seaweed']",Distinct arsenic metabolites following seaweed consumption in humans.,"[None, 'Q000652', 'Q000652', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000652', 'Q000737']","[None, 'urine', 'urine', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'urine', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28634348,2019

Increasing number of reports from plants regarding different Mediator subunits involved in a multitude of processes spanning from plant development to environmental interactions have firmly established it as a central hub of plant regulatory networks.

Second, the composition of the Mediator complex in a particular species is not static under all developmental and environmental conditions. Besides this, at times, Mediator complex is used in in vitro transcription systems. Rice, a staple food crop of the world, is used as a model monocot crop.

Components in the saliva may aid in food digestion, whereas other components are recognized by plants as cues to elicit defense responses. Despite the ecological and economical importance of these plant-feeding insects, knowledge of their saliva composition is limited to a few species. In this study, we identified the salivary proteins of larvae of the fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda; determined qualitative and quantitative differences in the salivary proteome of the two host races-corn and rice strains-of this insect; and identified changes in total protein concentration and relative protein abundance in the saliva of FAW larvae associated with different host plants. Quantitative proteomic analyses were performed using labeling with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 98 proteins were identified (>99% confidence) in the FAW saliva. These proteins were further categorized into five functional groups: proteins potentially involved in (1) plant defense regulation, (2) herbivore offense, (3) insect immunity, (4) detoxification, (5) digestion, and (6) other functions. Moreover, there were differences in the salivary proteome between the FAW strains that were identified by label-free proteomic analyses. Thirteen differentially identified proteins were present in each strain. There were also differences in the relative abundance of eleven salivary proteins between the two FAW host strains as well as differences within each strain associated with different diets. The total salivary protein concentration was also different for the two strains reared on different host plants.

Cadmium was detected in 228,687 food samples from 32 food categrories by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The dietary cadmium exposures were estimated by combining the cadmium concentration data with food consumption data derived from the China National Nutrient and Health Survey 2002, and evaluated against the Provisional Tolerable Monthly Intake (PTMI) of 25 μg/kg BW/month established by the Joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives (JECFA). The mean dietary cadmium exposure of the general Chinese population (15.3 μg/kg BW/month) was below the PTMI. The high consumer exposures (95th percentile, P95) for the general population and different sub-groups were higher than the PTMI. The dietary cadmium exposure of the southern population was apparently higher than that of the northern population. Rice was the most important contributor to cadmium exposure for Chinese people, especially those living in the southern areas of China.

The highest endpoint level of phytase activity inhibition was 90%, observed with grain protein extracts (GPE) from F. graminearum infected wheat. Wheat GPE from grains infected with F. graminearum inhibits phytase activity significantly more than GPE from non-infected grains.

To understand the molecular function and the defense response of durable disease resistance in cereals, the metabolic response of Lr34 was investigated in, except for the Lr34 gene, genetically identical lines of barley, rice and wheat. A broad range of compounds including primary, secondary and lipophilic metabolites were analyzed by a combination of gas (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) mass spectrometry (MS) based methods. Data from metabolomics correlated well with transcriptomics data for plant defense responses such as the formation of anti-fungal hordatines or the components of the glyoxylate cycle. Induction of the glyoxylate cycle found in transgenic Lr34 rice grown in the greenhouse was confirmed in field-grown natural Lr34 wheat. Constitutively active plant defense responses were observed in the different cereals.",Chimia,"['D001487', 'D002849', 'D002851', 'D060467', 'D001467', 'D050356', 'D020082', 'D055442', 'D012275', 'D010935', 'D010940', 'D064210', 'D053719', 'D014908']","['Basidiomycota', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Disease Resistance', 'Hordeum', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Magnaporthe', 'Metabolome', 'Oryza', 'Plant Diseases', 'Plant Proteins', 'Secondary Metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triticum']",Combined GC- and UHPLC-HR-MS Based Metabolomics to Analyze Durable Anti-fungal Resistance Processes in Cereals.,"['Q000472', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000472', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000235']","['pathogenicity', 'methods', 'methods', None, 'genetics', None, 'pathogenicity', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28446328,2019

Diet was assessed at Gestation Week 28 and at Postpartum Month 1, using a locally-validated dish-based semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Toenail As concentration was analyzed by microwave-assisted acid digestion and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Associations between natural log-transformed consumption of individual food items and temporally matched natural log-transformed toenail As concentration were quantified using general linear models that accounted for As concentration in the primary drinking water source and other potential confounders. The analysis was stratified by As in drinking water (≤50 μg/L versus >50 μg/L) and the time of dietary assessment (Gestation Week 28 versus Postpartum Week 1). Interestingly, toenail As was not significantly associated with consumption of plain rice as hypothesized. However, toenail As was positively associated with consumption of several vegetable, fish and meat items and was negatively associated with consumption of rice, cereal, fruits, and milk based food items.

Material and methods: The content and bioaccesibility (soluble and dialysable fractions) of Fe and Zn were determined. For thisin vitro gastrointestinal digestion in a first phase of gastric digestion (pepsin) followed by a second phase of intestinal digestion (with pancreatin and bile salts) was simulated. The atomic absorption spectrometry mineral content measured in soluble and dialyzable fractions. 
Results: Traditional porridges from Honduras (PTH) showed low density of micronutrients being the PTH prepared based on “rice with beans and greens”, “rice with ground beans” and “beans with banana” which had a higher content values of 1.96, 1.56, and 1.46 mg Fe/100 g, respectively, although in vitroavailability values below 50% of its content. For Zn in these recipes, the values found were very low being below the detection limit. In relation to industrial porridges (PIH), those of “rice”, “wheat with milk” and “5 cereals” they had a higher content of Fe (9.4, 8.53 and 7.56 mg Fe/100 g, respectively).

The resulting method was fully validated in terms of intra-day and inter-day precision, accuracy, linearity, range, LOD, LOQ, and matrix effects. The matrix effect phenomenon evaluated by comparison of slopes of calibration curves was completely eliminated by solid-phase extraction based on the technique of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Comparison of elution profiles obtained on the MIP and corresponding control non-imprinted polymer (NIP) showed selectivity of the extraction procedure. In addition, selectivity of the MIP material and the molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) was also proved by experiments evaluating retention of analytes physico-chemically similar to the target molecule. Extraction recoveries of these analytes represented by estrogen derivatives (estrone, estriol, 17α-ethinylestradiol, and β-estradiol) were very low or even null. Synthesis and preparation of the resulting MIP sorbent was characterized by excellent repeatability expressed as RSD 7.7% (n=9) of extraction recoveries. The determined capacity of the MIP material reaching 375ng/mg is sufficient for analysis of the evaluated statin in its natural sources. Suitability of the resulting MISPE-UHPLC-MS/MS procedure for real sample analysis was verified by the determination of lovastatin in one dietary supplement based on the red yeast rice with a given amount of the target analyte.

Simultaneously, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is considered as an effective processing technique to enhance micronutrients utilization efficiency of GBR and improve products flavor, but no information about the effects of HHP treatments on volatile fingerprinting of GBR has been reported. Therefore, the objective of this work was to apply HHP to improve the flavor and odor of GBR grains by exploring HHP-induced changes in aroma compounds. GBR grains were obtained by incubating at 37°C for 36h, and subsequently subjected to HHP treatments at pressures 100, 300 and 500MPa for 15min, using 0.1MPa as control. Headspace solid-phase micro extraction coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometry was used to characterize process-induced shifts of volatile organic compounds fingerprinting, followed by multivariate analysis. Our results confirmed the significant reduction of total volatile fractions derived from germination process. Contrarily, the following HHP treatments greatly enhanced the flavor components of GBR, particularly characteristic odorants including aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols.

For restricting the translocation of HM into grain, many proteins were regulated to involve in the process. To identify these proteins, 2D-based proteomic analysis was carried out using different rice genotypes with distinct Cd accumulation in grains and as affected by an alleviating regulator (AR) in field experiments. AR application improved grain quality, with increased contents in Glu, Cys, His, Pro, and protein. Twenty-six low-grain HM accumulation-associated protein species were identified and categorized as physiological functions via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry. Among these proteins, 8, 9, and 9 proteins exhibited higher accumulation, lower accumulation, and unchanged accumulation, respectively, in Xiushui817 (low accumulator) vs R8097 (high accumulator) under control conditions but showed differential accumulation patterns after AR application. These proteins included sucrose synthase 3, alanine aminotransferase, glutelin, cupin family protein, and zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 32. The differential expression of these protein species might contribute to decreased HM accumulation in grain via decreasing the protein accumulation which had high affinity to HM or regulating energy metabolism and signal transduction.

Under the same N rate, incorporating CMV as GM (the treatments of M and NM) mitigated N2O emission during the growing periods of rice plant, reduced the NO3- content and activities of nitrate and nitrite reductase as well as the population of nitrifying bacteria in top soil at maturity stage of rice plant versus FN pots. The global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of N2O from monocropped rice field was ranked as M<NM<FN. However, the treatment of NM increased rice grain yield and soil NH4+ content, which were dramatically decreased in the M pots, over the treatment of FN.

The PCX resin was adopted due to its higher extraction capability and selectivity for all targets compared to others, and in this case, almost no matrix effects (-5% to 8%) were observed for all of the ustiloxins monitored. The developed method reached limits of quantification of 0.2-2ngg",Journal of chromatography.

Glass slides were functionalized by an ionic liquid, 1-carboxyethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, and were used for the simultaneous extraction of seven triazine herbicides in rice samples. The effects of the type of extraction solvent, the extraction time, the type and volume of loading solvent, and the type of eluting solvent on the extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum operation conditions, the limits of detection for seven triazine herbicides in rice samples obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography were 3.16-5.42 ng/g, which were lower than the maximum residue levels established by various organizations. The linear correlation coefficients were higher than 0.9975 in the concentration range of 0.015-1.08 μg/g for the seven triazine herbicides. The recoveries of the seven triazine herbicides at the two concentration levels of 0.15 and 0.45 μg/g are between 82.47 and 104.21%, with relative standard deviations of 0.69-9.19%.

This paper reports the validation of QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe)-based methods applied to three different food samples (brown rice, red pepper and mandarin orange) analysed using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The validation of the analytical methods used to measure 113 pesticides, including various insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, was conducted in three food matrices and at three spiking levels by three different laboratories. The set of validated results was interpreted, statistically analysed and visualised using principal component analysis (PCA). Notably, the matrix effects in GC-MS analysis for most of the tested pesticides from different matrices were lowered to practical values (less than 30%) appropriate for routine analysis. This allowed for the quantification of pesticides in the samples using standard and analyte protectants (APs) in the reagent method blank as a screening measure, providing an alternative to matrix-matched calibration. Alternatively, the use of only one standardised calibration (grape matrix) in combination with APs also allowed for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of pesticides in different matrices. The inclusion of APs reduced the differences in the matrix-induced enhancement effects of various samples. The use of an internal standard (IS) to correct the matrix effects was also noted. The normalisation of the analyte peak with triphenyl phosphate (TPP) as an IS resulted in a slight improvement of validation values such as precision and linearity in only one laboratory, but it lowered the value of matrix effects in all three laboratories.","Food additives & contaminants.

Initially, a DNA/DNA duplex was formed between a fluorescein-labeled AFB1 aptamer and its partially complementary DNA strand containing a quencher moiety, resulting in fluorescence quenching due to the close proximity of fluorophore and quencher. Upon the addition of AFB1, an aptamer/AFB1 complex was generated to release the quencher-modified DNA strand, thus recovered the fluorescence of fluorescein and enabled quantitative detection for AFB1 by monitoring fluorescence enhancement. Under optimized conditions, this assay exhibited a linear response to AFB1 in the range of 5-100ng/mL with a detection limit down to 1.6ng/mL. Trials of this assay in infant rice cereal with satisfactory recovery in the range of 93.0%-106.8%, demonstrate that the new assay could be a potential sensing platform for AFB1 determination in food.

27506720,"A new method for the speciation analysis of arsenic in food using narrow-bore high-performance liquid-chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) has been developed. Fast separation of arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid was carried out in 7 min using an anion-exchange narrow-bore Nucleosil 100 SB column and 12 mM ammonium dihydrogen phosphate of pH 5.2 as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min(-1). A PFA-ST micronebulizer jointed to a cyclonic spray chamber was used for HPLC-ICP-MS coupling. Compared with standard-bore HPLC-ICP-MS, the new method has provided higher sensitivity, reduced mobile-phase consumption, a lower matrix plasma load and a shorter analysis time. The achieved instrumental limits of detection were in the 0.3 - 0.4 ng As mL(-1) range, and the precision was better than 3%. The arsenic compounds were efficiently (>80%) extracted from various food samples using a 1:5 methanol/water solution, with additional ultrasonic treatment for rice products. The applicability of this method was demonstrated by the analysis of several samples, such as seafood (fish, mussels, shrimps, edible algae) and rice-based products (Jasmine and Arborio rice, spaghetti, flour, crackers), including three certified reference materials.

27506365,"We developed a new fast and selective analytical method for the determination of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in rice by a gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in combination with one step derivatization of inorganic arsenic (iAs) with British Anti-Lewsite (BAL). Two step derivatization of iAs with BAL has been previously performed for the GC-MS analysis. In this paper, the quantitative one step derivatization condition was successfully established. The GC-MS/MS was carried out with a short nonpolar capillary column (0.25 mm × 10 m) under the conditions of fast oven temperature ramp rate (4 °C/s) and high linear velocity (108.8 cm/s) of the carrier gas. The established GC-MS/MS method showed an excellent linearity (r(2) > 0.999) in a tested range (0.2-100.0 μg L(-1)), ultra-low limit of detection (LOD, 0.08 pg), and high precision and accuracy. The GC-MS/MS technique showed far greater selectivity (22.5 fold higher signal to noise ratio in rice sample) on iAs than GC-MS method. The gas chromatographic running time was only 2.5 min with the iAs retention time of 1.98 min. The established method was successfully applied to quantify the iAs contents in polished rice. The mean iAs content in the Korean polished rice (n = 27) was 66.1 μg kg(-1) with the range of 37.5-125.0 μg kg(-1). This represents the first report on the GC-tandem mass spectrometry in combination with the one step derivatization with BAL for the iAs speciation in rice. This GC-MS/MS method would be a simple, useful and reliable measure for the iAs analysis in rice in the laboratories in which the expensive and element specific HPLC-ICP-MS is not available.

The procedure involved extraction of the rodenticides from samples with acetone, followed by liquid-liquid partitioning with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and 10% sodium chloride aqueous solution, then cleanup using GPC, and finally, analysis using LC-MS/MS. High recoveries from the GPC column were obtained for all rodenticides tested using a mobile phase of acetone/cyclohexane/triethylamine (400:1600:1, v/v/v). An ODS column, which contains low levels of metal impurities, gave satisfactory peak shapes for both hydroxycoumarin- and indandione-type rodenticides in the LC-MS/MS separation. The average recoveries of rodenticides from eight agricultural foods (apple, eggplant, cabbage, orange, potato, tomato, brown rice, and soybean) fortified at 0.0005-0.001 mg/kg ranged from 76 to 116%, except for bromadiolone in orange (53%) and diphacinone in soybean (54%), and the relative standard deviations ranged from 1 to 16%.

27420056,"Trehalose is a nonreducing α,α-1,1-disaccharide in a wide range of organisms, and has diverse biological functions that range from serving as an energy source to acting as a protective/signal sugar. However, significant amounts of trehalose have rarely been detected in higher plants, and the function of trehalose in the drought-tolerant crop cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is unclear. We measured soluble sugar concentrations of nine plant species with differing levels of drought tolerance and 41 cassava varieties using high-performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light-scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD). Significantly high amounts of trehalose were identified in drought-tolerant crops cassava, Jatropha curcas, and castor bean (Ricinus communis). All cassava varieties tested contained high amounts of trehalose, although their concentrations varied from 0.23 to 1.29 mg·g(-1) fresh weight (FW), and the trehalose level was highly correlated with dehydration stress tolerance of detached leaves of the varieties. Moreover, the trehalose concentrations in cassava leaves increased 2.3-5.5 folds in response to osmotic stress simulated by 20% PEG 6000. Through database mining, 24 trehalose pathway genes, including 12 trehalose-6-phosphate synthases (TPS), 10 trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases (TPP), and two trehalases were identified in cassava. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that there were four cassava TPS genes (MeTPS1-4) that were orthologous to the solely active TPS gene (AtTPS1 and OsTPS1) in Arabidopsis and rice, and a new TPP subfamily was identified in cassava, suggesting that the trehalose biosynthesis activities in cassava had potentially been enhanced in evolutionary history. RNA-seq analysis indicated that MeTPS1 was expressed at constitutionally high level before and after osmotic stress, while other trehalose pathway genes were either up-regulated or down-regulated, which may explain why cassava accumulated high level of trehalose under normal conditions. MeTPS1 was then transformed into tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana). Results indicated that transgenic tobacco lines accumulated significant level of trehalose and possessed improved drought stress tolerance. In conclusion, cassava accumulated significantly high amount of trehalose under normal conditions due to multiplied trehalose biosynthesis gene families and constant expression of the active MeTPS1 gene. High levels of trehalose subsequently contributed to high drought stress tolerance.

27379107,"Magnaporthe oryzae is a rice blast fungus and plant pathogen that causes a serious rice disease and, therefore, poses a threat to the world's second most important food security crop. Plant transformation technology has become an adaptable system for cultivar improvement and to functionally analyze genes in plants. The objective of this study was to determine the effects (through over-expressing and using the CaMV 35S promoter) of Pikh on MR219 resistance because it is a rice variety that is susceptible to the blast fungus pathotype P7.2. Thus, a full DNA and coding DNA sequence (CDS) of the Pikh gene, 3172 bp, and 1206 bp in length, were obtained through amplifying the gDNA and cDNA template from a PH9-resistant rice variety using a specific primer. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation technology was also used to introduce the Pikh gene into the MR219 callus. Subsequently, transgenic plants were evaluated from the DNA to protein stages using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), semi-quantitative RT-PCR, real-time quantitative PCR and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Transgenic plants were also compared with a control using a real-time quantification technique (to quantify the pathogen population), and transgenic and control plants were challenged with the local most virulent M. oryzae pathotype, P7.2. Based on the results, the Pikh gene encodes a hydrophilic protein with 18 sheets, 4 helixes, and 21 coils. This protein contains 401 amino acids, among which the amino acid sequence from 1 to 376 is a non-cytoplasmic region, that from 377 to 397 is a transmembrane region, and that from 398 to 401 is a cytoplasmic region with no identified disordered regions. The Pikh gene was up-regulated in the transgenic plants compared with the control plants. The quantity of the amino acid leucine in the transgenic rice plants increased significantly from 17.131 in the wild-type to 47.865 mg g(-1) in transgenic plants. The M. oryzae population was constant at 31, 48, and 72 h after inoculation in transgenic plants, while it was increased in the inoculated control plants. This study successfully clarified that over-expression of the Pikh gene in transgenic plants can improve their blast resistance against the M. oryzae pathotype P7.2.

Conventional resistance breeding strategies are hindered by the absence of tractable genetic resistance in any crop host. Understanding the biology and pathogenicity mechanisms of this fungus is important for addressing these disease issues, however, little is known about how R. solani causes disease. The data described in this article is derived from applying mass spectrometry based proteomics to identify soluble, membrane-bound and culture filtrate proteins produced under wheat infection and vegetative growth conditions. Comparisons of the data for sample types in this set will be useful to identify metabolic pathway changes as the fungus switches from saprophytic to a pathogenic lifestyle or pathogenicity related proteins contributing to the ability to cause disease on wheat.

To establish method performance characteristics, wheat was spiked with citrinin at levels of 10-200 μg/kg, whereas red yeast rice was spiked at levels of 100-3000 μg/kg. Methanol-water (75 + 25, v/v) was used for the extraction of cereals and animal feed, and extraction was with 100% methanol for red yeast rice. Cleanup used a commercial citrinin IAC, followed by LC-fluorescence (λex, 330 nm; λem, 500 nm). Recoveries ranged from 80 to 110%, with r from 0.7 to 4.3%. The LOQ for citrinin in both wheat and red yeast rice was 10 μg/kg, with an LOD of 3 μg/kg. Satisfactory performance was demonstrated in a proficiency testing exercise for a sample of maize contaminated with both citrinin and ochratoxin A.

This assay uses selective nicking enzyme amplification technology to amplify target genes. Samples are enriched for 12-24 h and then lysed. The assay is completed within 40 min using real-time detection in a combination incubator/fluorescence detector and software. When 44 distinct strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and 6 strains of E. coli O157:NM were tested for inclusivity, all 50 strains produced positive results. In exclusivity testing, 57 strains representing 33 species of closely related Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, including 11 non-H7 O157 strains and shiga toxin-producing E. coli other than O157:H7, were evaluated. All 57 nontarget strains generated negative ANSR assay results. Using 80% lean ground beef and beef trim (approximately 20% fat), ANSR method performance was compared to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook reference culture procedure. ANSR performance with baby spinach and sprout irrigation water was measured against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual reference method. ANSR method performance was not statistically different to that of the reference methods using two different enrichment options. For ground beef and beef trim, the standard enrichment in modified Tryptone Soya Broth can be analyzed using the ANSR assay with a 1:10 dilution of the enrichment in phosphate-buffered saline and produces equivalent results to the reference method. Additionally, in most matrixes tested (exception is spinach which required 24 h enrichment) the assay offers great efficiency and flexibility over the reference method with a 12-24 h single-step enrichment. Equivalent results were observed at both time points (12 and 24 h) to reference methods. Small changes to the assay parameters minimally affected ANSR method performance.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the production of antifungal carboxylic acids after sourdough fermentation of quinoa and rice flour using the antifungal strains Lactobacillus reuteri R29 and Lactobacillus brevis R2Δ as bioprotective cultures and the non-antifungal L. brevis L1105 as a negative control strain. The impact of the fermentation substrate was evaluated in terms of metabolic activity, acidification pattern and quantity of antifungal carboxylic acids. These in situ produced compounds (n=20) were extracted from the sourdough using a QuEChERS method and detected by a new UHPLC-MS/MS chromatography. Furthermore, the sourdough was applied in situ using durability tests against environmental moulds to investigate the biopreservative potential to prolong the shelf life of bread. Organic acid production and TTA values were lowest in rice sourdough. The sourdough fermentation of the different flour substrates generated a complex and significantly different profile of carboxylic acids. Extracted quinoa sourdough detected the greatest number of carboxylic acids (n=11) at a much higher concentration than what was detected from rice sourdough (n=9). Comparing the lactic acid bacteria strains, L. reuteri R29 fermented sourdoughs contained generally higher concentrations of acetic and lactic acid but also the carboxylic acids. Among them, 3-phenyllactic acid and 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid were present at a significant concentration. This was correlated with the superior protein content of quinoa flour and its high protease activity. With the addition of L. reuteri R29 inoculated sourdough, the shelf life was extended by 2 days for quinoa (+100%) and rice bread (+67%) when compared to the non-acidified controls. The L. brevis R2Δ fermented sourdough bread reached a shelf life of 4 days for quinoa (+100%) and rice (+33%).

Following the induction with Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside the OsMTI-2b was expressed as carboxyl-terminal extensions of glutathione-S-transferase (GST-tag), a 6His-tag, and an S-tag. The expressed recombinant fusion protein was named GST-OsMTI-2b. As compared with control, transgenic E. coli cells expressing GST-OsMTI-2b accumulated more Pb(2+), Ni(2+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) from culture medium and showed increased tolerance against these metals. Furthermore the E. coli cells expressing OsMTI-2b accumulated significantly higher Pb(2+) than previously made strains which expressing other rice OsMT isoforms.

27061371,"The arsenic (As) is a toxic element causing major health concern worldwide. Arsenate stress caused no significant reduction in growth parameters and shoot electrolyte leakage but showed increased root arsenate reductase activity along with relatively lower root As content and shoot translocation rate in As-tolerant BRRI 33 than in As-sensitive BRRI 51. It indicates that As inhibition and tolerance mechanisms are driven by root responses. Interestingly, As stress showed consistent decrease in phosphate content and expression of phosphate transporters (OsPT8, OsPT4, OsPHO1;2) under both high and low phosphate conditions in roots of BRRI 33, suggesting that limiting phosphate transport mainly mediated by OsPHO1;2 directs less As accumulation in BRRI 33. Further, BRRI 33 showed simultaneous increase in OsPCS1 (phytochelatin synthase) expression and phytochelatins (PCs) content in roots under As exposure supporting the hypothesis that root As sequestration acts as 'firewall system' in limiting As translocation in shoots. Furthermore, increased CAT, POD, SOD, GR, along with elevated glutathione, methionine, cysteine and proline suggests that strong antioxidant defense plays integral part to As tolerance in BRRI 33. Again, BRRI 33 self-grafts and plants having BRRI 33 rootstock combined with BRRI 51 scion had no adverse effect on morphological parameters but showed reduced As translocation rate, increased root arsenate reductase activity, shoot PC synthesis and root OsPHO1;2 expression due to As stress. It confirms that signal driving As tolerance mechanisms is generated in the roots. These findings can be implemented for As detoxification and As-free transgenic rice production for health safety.

From this information soil to plant arsenic transfer was investigated plus the distribution of arsenic in rice across the geographical regions of Spain and Portugal. Commercial polished rice was also obtained from each region and tested for arsenic speciation, showing a positive correlation with field-obtained rice grain. Commercial polished rice had the lowest i-As content in Andalucia, Murcia and Valencia while Extremadura had the highest concentrations.

In this study, immunomodulatory effects of glycoprotein obtained from rice bran were studied in normal mice and mouse models of cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression. We prepared glycoprotein from rice bran by using ammonium precipitation and anion chromatography techniques. Different doses of glycoprotein from rice bran (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg) were administered orally for 28 days. On day 21, cyclophosphamide at a dose of 100 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally. Glycoprotein from rice bran showed a significant dose-dependent restoration of the spleen index and white blood cell count in the immunocompromised mice. Glycoprotein from rice bran affected the immunomodulatory function by inducing the proliferation of splenic lymphocytes, which produce potential T and B cells. Moreover, it prevented cyclophosphamide-induced damage of Th1-type immunomodulatory function through enhanced secretion of Th1-type cytokines (interferon-γ and interleukin-12). These results indicate that glycoprotein from rice bran significantly recovered cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression. Based on these data, it was concluded that glycoprotein from rice bran is a potent immunomodulator and can be developed to recover the immunity of immunocompromised individuals.

Lactobacillus casei WYS3 was isolated from rice straw that contained pesticide residues. Non-sterilized rice straw, which was inoculated with L. casei WYS3, showed increased removal of chlorpyrifos after ensiling, compared with rice straw that was not inoculated with L. casei WYS3 or sterilized rice straw. In pure culture, these strains can bind chlorpyrifos as indicated by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Viable L. casei WYS3 was shown to bind 33.3-42% of exogenously added chlorpyrifos. These results are similar to those of acid-treated cells but less than those of heat-treated cells, which were found to bind 32.0% and 77.2% of the added chlorpyrifos respectively. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis determined that L. casei WYS3 detoxified chlorpyrifos via P-O-C cleavage. Real-time polymerized chain reaction analysis determined that organophosphorus hydrolase gene expression tripled after the addition of chlorpyrifos to LAB cultures, compared with the control group (without chlorpyrifos).

Proportions of arsenic metabolites (%iAs, %MMA and %DMA) in urine were modelled in OLS regressions as functions of food groups, dietary patterns, nutrient intake, and nutritional status. Exposure to arsenic was low (median U-As: 9.9µg/L) and household water (water As: median 0.45µg/L) was not a major contributor to exposure. Children with higher consumption of rice had higher U-As but lower %iAs, %MMA, and higher %DMA. Children with higher meat consumption had lower %iAs and higher %DMA. Higher scores on ""nutrient dense"" dietary pattern were related to lower %iAs and %MMA, and higher %DMA. Higher intake of dietary folate was associated with lower %MMA and higher %DMA. Overweight children had lower %MMA and higher %DMA than normal-weight children. In summary, rice was an important predictor of exposure to inorganic arsenic and DMA.

26828416,"Rice consumption is a primary pathway for human methylmercury (MeHg) exposure in inland mercury mining areas of Asia. In addition, the use of iodomethane, a common fumigant that significantly accelerates the methylation of mercury in soil under sunlight, could increase the MeHg exposure from rice. Conventional hyphenated techniques used for mercury speciation analysis are usually too costly for most developing countries. Consequently, there is an increased interest in the development of sensitive and inexpensive methods for the speciation of mercury in rice. In this work, gas chromatography (GC) coupled to dielectric barrier discharge optical emission spectrometry (DBD-OES) was developed for the speciation analysis of mercury in rice. Prior to GC-DBD-OES analysis, mercury species were derivatized to their volatile species with NaBPh4 and preconcentrated by headspace solid phase microextraction using porous carbons. Limits of detection of 0.5 μg kg(-1) (0.16 ng), 0.75 μg kg(-1) (0.24 ng), and 1.0 μg kg(-1) (0.34 ng) were obtained for Hg(2+), CH3Hg(+), and CH3CH2Hg(+), respectively, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) better than 5.2% and 6.8% for one fiber or fiber-to-fiber mode, respectively. Recoveries of 90-105% were obtained for the rice samples, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed technique. Owing to the small size, low power, and low gas consumption of DBD-OES as well as efficient extraction of mercury species by porous carbons headspace solid phase micro-extraction, the proposed technique provides several advantages including compactness, cost-effectiveness, and potential to couple with miniature GC to accomplish the field speciation of mercury in rice compared to conventional hyphenated techniques.

This study capitalizes on recent genomic studies by applying mass spectrometry based proteomics to identify soluble, membrane-bound and culture filtrate proteins produced under wheat infection and vegetative growth conditions. Many of the proteins found in the culture filtrate had predicted functions relating to modification of the plant cell wall, a major activity required for pathogenesis on the plant host, including a number found only under infection conditions. Other infection related proteins included a high proportion of proteins with redox associated functions and many novel proteins without functional classification.

26809615,"A novel and sensitive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for simultaneous enantioselective determination of flufiprole and its hydrolysis metabolite in paddy field ecosystem. The separation and determination were performed using reversed-phase chromatography on a novel cellulose chiral stationary phase, a Lux Cellulose-4 (150 mm × 2.0 mm) column, under isocratic conditions at 0.25 mL/min flow rate. The effects of other four different polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases (CSPs) on the separation and simultaneous enantioseparation of the two target compounds were also evaluated. The elution orders of the eluting enantiomers were identified by an optical rotation detector. Modified QuEChERS (acronym for Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) method and solid-phase extraction (SPE) were used for the enrichment and cleanup of paddy water, rice straw, brown rice and paddy soil samples, respectively. Parameters including the matrix effect, linearity, precision, accuracy and stability were evaluated. Under the optimal conditions, the mean recoveries for all enantiomers from the above four sample matrix were ranged from 83.6% to 107%, with relative standard deviations (RSD) in the range of 1.0-5.8%.

The extraction efficiency for total arsenic was determined by analysing CRM materials DORM-3 fish protein, NIES 106 rice flour and GBW10015 spinach. These were compared with total arsenic concentration determined using microwave-assisted acid digestion and ICP-MS. The total arsenic concentrations in the CRM materials were in good agreement with the certified values. Enzymatic hydrolysis using trypsin has been successfully employed to extract arsenic species in DORM-3 and fish samples. Whilst this method of hydrolysing the proteins worked well for the fish samples, an alternative approach was required to facilitate the digestion of cellulose in plant materials. However, enzymatic extraction using cellulase was found to give unsatisfactory results for both the NIES and GBW10015 CRM materials. Dilute nitric acid (1% HNO3) was found to give a more efficient extraction for arsenic species in the same CRM materials and rice samples. The study was extended to evaluate a range of real samples. Total arsenic concentrations in 13 different types of fish tissue were determined following microwave-assisted acid digestion using nitric acid/hydrogen peroxide, followed by measurement using HPLC-ICP-MS for speciation analysis. The results obtained for fish were in the range of 3.53-98.80 µg g(-1) As (dry weight). Similarly, the results of 17 rice samples were in the range of 0.054-0.823 µg g(-1).

Rice seedlings were cultivated in nutrient solutions with IHg or MeHg for three weeks. Proteins were extracted from the roots and separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using ESI-MS/MS and identified by PMF. 26 and 29 protein spots were differentially expressed in the IHg- and MeHg-exposed roots, respectively. The proteins responsive to Hg exposure are involved in antioxidative defense, sulfur and glutathione metabolism, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, programmed cell death, and pathogen defense. Chitinase and salt stress-induced proteins exhibited a greater differentially expression in response to MeHg stress compared to IHg stress. Hg-binding proteins were detected by the combined use of 1-DE, SRXRF, and ESI-MS/MS. The results showed that Hg was bound to proteins of 15-25 kDa in rice roots under Hg stress. The Hg contents in the band under IHg stress were remarkably higher than those under MeHg. Hg binds to proteins, which leads to irreversible damage of root growth.

Experiment was carried out on male Wistar rats with initial weight 140-180 g. After a quarantine during the preparatory period rats for 14 days were accustomed to the partial (50%) replacement of the standard diet by bakery products with standard compound­ing. Then, 7 groups of rats were formed: the 1st group of rats (control group, n=10) continued to receive bakery products of a standard composition; groups with the 2nd on 7th (experimental, n=8 in everyone) received enriched bakery products: the 2nd group - with blueberry powder; the 3rd group - with mountain ash powder; the 4th group - with sea-buckthorn powder; the 5th group - with flour of a pine nut; the 6th group - with rice bran oil; the 7th group - with pumpkin oil. The intensity of free radical oxidation and antioxidant activity (by chemiluminescence method), activity of superoxide dismutase and level of secondary oxidation products reacted with thiobarbituric acid (by spectrophotometry) were monitored in rat blood serum. It has been shown that the use of bakery products with different compounding in the animal diet had different effects on indicators of prooxidant-antioxidant system of blood serum. Bakery products containing sea buckthorn pomace powder, flour of pine nut and rice bran oil reduced intensity of free radical oxidation in rat blood serum by 36.0, 24.6 and 18.8%, respectively. It is suggested that bakery products containing flour of pine nut products brake a free radical oxidation in rat blood serum in case of simultaneous content of natural antioxidants and melanoidins. The anthocyanins of powder from blueberry berries can render antioxidant effect and slow down formation of by-products of oxidation.

In this study, analyses were performed to determine the levels and incidence of aflatoxins (AFs) in peanut products, tree nuts, spices, and Coix seeds; ochratoxin A (OTA) in wheat and roasted coffee, as well as OTA and AFs in rice; and citrinin (CIT) in red yeast rice (RYR) products. A total of 712 samples from nine different food categories were collected between 2012 and 2013. The samples were analyzed over 2 years for AFs, OTA, and CIT by methods recommended by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. These official analytical methods were extensively validated in-house and through interlaboratory trials. The analytical values of suspected contaminated specimens were confirmed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify the specific mycotoxin present in the sample. We show that 689 samples (96.8%) complied with the regulations set by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. AFs were found in four peanut-candy products, one peanut-flour product, one pistachio product, one Sichuan-pepper product, and one Coix seed product. All had exceeded the maximum levels of 15 parts per billion for peanut and 10 parts per billion for other food products. Furthermore, 14 RYR samples contained CIT above 5 parts per million, and one RYR tablet exceeded the maximum amount allowed. Instances of AFs in substandard Sichuan pepper and Coix seeds were first detected in Taiwan. Measures were taken by the relevant authorities to remove substandard products from the market in order to decrease consumer exposure to mycotoxin. Border control measures were applied to importing food commodities with a higher risk of mycotoxin contamination, such as peanut, Sichuan pepper, and RYR products.

By using calibration standards in cucumber matrix, recovery and precision were calculated in lettuce, orange and wheat for 109 pesticides at 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) in two sets of samples: one with and one without clean-up. For both spiking levels, 80-82% of the pesticides in the non-cleaned extracts and 80-84% of the pesticides in the cleaned extracts were within the acceptable recovery range of 70-120%. Precision data for both levels showed that 95% of the pesticides in the non-cleaned extracts and 93-95% of the pesticides in the cleaned extracts had RSDs below 20%. Recovery and precision data were determined using a two tailed t-test (p = 0.05). By using calibration standards in the respective matrix, we studied if the non-cleaned calibration standards gave an extra matrix effect compared with the cleaned standards by using the slope from calibration graphs and plotting the calculated extra matrix effect minus 100 for each compound. The results showed that for 79% of the pesticides, the extra matrix effect minus 100 was within the acceptable range of -20% to 20%. Five European Union proficiency tests on rye, mandarin, rice, pear and barley, respectively, from 2010 to 2012 were reanalysed omitting the clean-up step and showed satisfactory results. At least 70 injections of non-cleaned extracts were made without detecting any increased need for maintenance during the experimental period.

The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure to dioxin-related compounds was associated with bone mineral density in Yusho patients. In 2010, 262 women and 227 men underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry bone scans as part of the nationwide Yusho health examination. Serum levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls were measured using high-resolution gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. When adjusted for prefecture, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD and 2,3,7,8-TCDF were significantly positively associated with Z-scores in men. No congeners were positively associated with Z-scores in women. After adjustment for prefecture and body mass index, one congener, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD, was negatively associated with Z-scores in women. In contrast, no congeners remained significant in men after adjusting for body mass index. This may suggest that 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD has a negative effect on bone mineral density in women; however, the findings should be interpreted carefully, because no increase in the serum level of this congener was observed in patients with Yusho disease.",Chemosphere,"['D015502', 'D000368', 'D000369', 'D015992', 'D015519', 'D004147', 'D004781', 'D004785', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D007564', 'D008297', 'D008875', 'D011164']","['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Body Mass Index', 'Bone Density', 'Dioxins', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Porphyrias']",Effects of dioxin-related compounds on bone mineral density in patients affected by the Yusho incident.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000097', 'Q000009', 'Q000097', None, None, None, None, 'Q000453', None, None, 'Q000097']","[None, None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'blood', 'adverse effects', 'blood', None, None, None, None, 'epidemiology', None, None, 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26650575,2016
26631591,"Management of rice false smut disease caused by Villosiclava virens is dependent on demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides. Investigation of molecular mechanisms of resistance is therefore of upmost importance. In this study the gene encoding the target protein for DMI fungicides (VvCYP51) was cloned and investigated. The VvCYP51 gene in the resistant mutant revealed both a change from tyrosine to histidine at position 137 (Y137H) and elevated gene expression compared to the parental isolate. In order to determine which of these mechanisms was responsible for the reduced sensitivity to DMI fungicide tebuconazole, transformants expressing the mutated or the wild type VvCYP51 gene were generated. Transformants carrying the mutated gene were more resistant to tebuconazole compared to control transformants lacking the mutation, but the expression of the VvCYP51 gene was not significantly correlated with EC50 values. The wild type VvCYP51 protein exhibited stronger affinity for tebuconazole compared to the VvCYP51/Y137H in both molecular docking analysis and experimental binding assays. The UV-generated mutant as well as transformants expressing the VvCYP51/Y137H did not exhibit significant fitness penalties based on mycelial growth and spore germination, suggesting that isolates resistant to DMI fungicides based on the Y137H mutation may develop and be competitive in the field.

Present study explores role of variable S supply on rice leaf proteome, its inclination towards amino acids (AA) profile and non protein thiols under arsenite exposure. Analysis of 282 detected proteins on 2-DE gel revealed 113 differentially expressed proteins, out of which 80 were identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF. The identified proteins were mostly involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle, AA biosynthesis, photosynthesis, protein metabolism, stress and energy metabolism. Among these, glycolytic enzymes play a major role in AA biosynthesis that leads to change in AAs profiling. Proteins of glycolytic pathway, photosynthesis and energy metabolism were also validated by western blot analysis.

We combined high spatial resolution (5 μm), in order to detect cellular features, and high mass accuracy (<2 ppm root mean square error), for molecular specificity. Mass spectrometry imaging experiments were performed in positive and negative ion mode. Changes in metabolite patterns during plant development were investigated for germination of oilseed rape. The detailed localization of more than 90 compounds allowed assignment to metabolic processes and indicated possible functions in plant tissues. The 'untargeted' nature of MS imaging allows the detection of marker compounds for the physiological status, as demonstrated for plant-pathogen interactions. Our images show excellent correlation with optical/histological examination. In contrast to previous MS imaging studies of plants, we present a complete workflow that covers multiple species, such as oilseed rape, wheat seed and rice.

26460365,"This paper describes a convenient and rapid fluorescence sensor for determination of paraquat (PA) based on glutathione-capped CdS quantum dots (QDs). The methodology enabled the use of a simple synthesis procedure for water solubilization of CdS QDs via a fast route using glutathione as a capping agent within 15 min. The resulting water-soluble QDs exhibit a strong fluorescence emission at 536 nm with high and reproducible photostability. PA is an important class of electron acceptors for QDs. Thus, the fluorescence intensity of the glutathione-capped CdS QDs probe could be dramatically quenched by PA due to the electron transfer mechanism. The fluorescence intensity of the CdS QDs system was proportional to PA concentration in the range of 0.025 to 1.5 μg mL(-1), with a detection limit of 0.01 μg mL(-1). The time of analysis sample, including preparation of QDs and fluorescent measurement for PA, was only 20 min. Most of the potentially coexisting substances did not interfere with the PA-induced quenching effect except diquat. Furthermore, the analytical applicability of the proposed method was demonstrated by analyzing PA in water, rice and cabbage samples, and the recoveries were between 86 and 105% which satisfied the requirement of detection for PA. These results showed that the proposed method was simple in design and fast in operation, and could be used as a sensitive tool for detecting PA in environmental and agricultural samples.

26456797,"Brown spot disease, caused by Cochliobolus miyabeanus, is currently considered to be one of the most important yield reducers of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Despite its agricultural importance, little is known about the virulence mechanisms deployed by the fungus. Therefore, we set out to identify novel virulence factors with a role in disease development. This article reports, for the first time, the production of tentoxin by C. miyabeanus as a virulence factor during brown spot disease and the identification of the non-ribosomal protein synthetase (NRPS) CmNps3, responsible for tentoxin biosynthesis. We compared the chemical compounds produced by C. miyabeanus strains differing in virulence ability using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (HRMS). The production of tentoxin by a highly virulent strain was revealed by principal component analysis of the detected ions and confirmed by UHPLC coupled to tandem-quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The corresponding NRPS was identified by in silico genome analysis and confirmed by gene deletion. Infection tests with wild-type and Cmnps3 mutants showed that tentoxin acts as a virulence factor and is correlated with chlorosis development during the second phase of infection. Although rice has previously been classified as a tentoxin-insensitive plant species, our data demonstrate that tentoxin production by C. miyabeanus affects symptom development.",Molecular plant pathology,"['D001203', 'D002851', 'D017124', 'D005656', 'D017353', 'D005800', 'D012275', 'D010456', 'D010935', 'D015203', 'D017386', 'D013172', 'D053719', 'D037521']","['Ascomycota', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Fungal Proteins', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Fungal', 'Oryza', 'Peptides, Cyclic', 'Plant Diseases', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spores, Fungal', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Virulence Factors']","Comparative chemical screening and genetic analysis reveal tentoxin as a new virulence factor in Cochliobolus miyabeanus, the causal agent of brown spot disease on rice.","['Q000235', None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000382', 'Q000737', 'Q000382', None, None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000235']","['genetics', None, None, 'genetics', None, None, 'microbiology', 'chemistry', 'microbiology', None, None, 'physiology', None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26456797,2017

In this context, a targeted proteomic approach based on liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) technique was proposed to assess the presence of celiotoxic cereals, namely wheat, oats, barley and rye, in raw and processed food products. To this aim, unique marker peptides were properly selected in order to distinguish between the different cereal types. A revised cocktail solution based on reducing and denaturing agents was exploited for prolamin extraction from raw and processed food; in addition, defatting with hexane was carried out for sample clean-up, allowing to largely reduce problems related to matrix effect. Method validation on fortified rice flour showed good analytical performance in terms of sensitivity (limits of detection in the 2-18 mg kg(-1) range). However, poor trueness was calculated for self-made incurred bread (between 3 and 30% depending on the peptide), probably due to baking processes, which reduce gluten extractability. Thus, it is evident that in the case of processed foods further insights into sample treatment efficiency and reference materials for protein calibration are required to obtain accurate gluten determination. Finally, the developed method was applied for the analysis of market food products, offering the possibility to discriminate among cereals, with good agreement with labelled ingredients for gluten-containing foodstuffs.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D018554', 'D002851', 'D055050', 'D005504', 'D001467', 'D055315', 'D012434', 'D053719', 'D014908']","['Avena', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diet, Gluten-Free', 'Food Analysis', 'Hordeum', 'Prolamins', 'Secale', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triticum']","Multiplex liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the detection of wheat, oat, barley and rye prolamins towards the assessment of gluten-free product safety.","['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26454460,2016

Different data analysis tools have been developed in recent years such as XCMS (various forms (X) of chromatography mass spectrometry) and multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS)-based strategies. In this work, metabolites extracted from rice tissues cultivated in an environmental test chamber were subjected to untargeted full-scan LC-MS analysis, and the obtained data sets were analyzed using XCMS and MCR-ALS. These approaches were compared in the investigation of the effects of copper and cadmium exposure on rice tissue (roots and aerial parts) samples. Both methods give, as a result of their application, the whole set of resolved elution and spectra profiles of the extracted metabolites in control and metal-treated samples, as well as the values of their corresponding chromatographic peak areas. The effects caused by the two considered metals on rice samples were assessed by further chemometric analysis and statistical evaluation of these peak area values. Results showed that there was a statistically significant interaction between the considered factors (type of metal of treatment and tissue). Also, the discrimination of the samples according to both factors was possible. A tentative identification of the most discriminant metabolites (biomarkers) was assessed. It is finally concluded that both XCMS- and MCR-ALS-based strategies provided similar results in all the considered cases despite the completely different approaches used by these two methods in the chromatographic peak resolution and detection strategies.

The Acetobacter species is the primary starter for vinegar fermentation and has evolutionarily acquired acetic acid resistance, in which Acetobacter pasteurianus Ab3 is routinely used for industrial production of rice vinegar with a high acidity (9 %, w/v). In contrast to the documented short-term and low acetic acid effects on A. pasteurianus, here we investigated the molecular and cellular signatures of long-term and high acetic acid responses by proteomic profiling with bidimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/MS) analyses. Protein spots of interest were selected based on the threshold ANOVA p value of 0.05 and minimal twofold of differential expression, leading to the identification of 26 proteins that are functionally enriched in oxidoreductase activity, cell membrane, and metabolism. The alterations in protein functioning in respiratory chain and protein denaturation may underlay cellular modifications at the outer membrane. Significantly, we found that at higher acidity fermentation phase, the A. pasteurianus Ab3 cells would adapt to distinct physiological processes from that of an ordinary vinegar fermentation with intermediate acidity, indicating increasing energy requirement and dependency of membrane integrity during the transition of acetic acid production. Together, our study provided new insights into the adaptation mechanisms in A. pasteurianus to high acetic acid environments and yield novel regulators and key pathways during the development of acetic acid resistance.

Meanwhile, cell-to-cell communication between somatic (especial tapetum) cells and meiocytes are important for both somatic anther development and meiosis. To investigate possible molecular mechanisms modulating protein activities during anther development, we applied high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses for developing rice (Oryza sativa) anthers around the time of meiosis (RAM). In total, we identified 4984 proteins and 3203 phosphoproteins with 8973 unique phosphorylation sites (p-sites). Among those detected here, 1544 phosphoproteins are currently absent in the Plant Protein Phosphorylation DataBase (P3 DB), substantially enriching plant phosphorylation information. Mapman enrichment analysis showed that 'DNA repair','transcription regulation' and 'signaling' related proteins were overrepresented in the phosphorylated proteins. Ten genetically identified rice meiotic proteins were detected to be phosphorylated at a total of 25 p-sites; moreover more than 400 meiotically expressed proteins were revealed to be phosphorylated and their phosphorylation sites were precisely assigned. 163 putative secretory proteins, possibly functioning in cell-to-cell communication, are also phosphorylated. Furthermore, we showed that DNA synthesis, RNA splicing and RNA-directed DNA methylation pathways are extensively affected by phosphorylation.

Ustiloxin B is an antimitotic cyclopeptide mycotoxin isolated from the rice false smut balls that formed in the pathogen-infected rice spikelets. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) designated as mAb 1B5A10 was generated with ustiloxin B-ovalbumin conjugate. A highly-sensitive and specific indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) was then developed. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the icELISA was 18.0 ng/mL for the detection of ustiloxin B; the limit of detection was 0.6 ng/mL, and the calibration range was from 2.5 to 107.4 ng/mL. The LOD/LOQ values of the developed ELISA used for the determination of ustiloxin B in rice false smut balls and rice grains were 12/50 μg/g and 30/125 ng/g, respectively. The mAb 1B5A10 cross-reacted with ustiloxin A at 13.9% relative to ustiloxin B.

Using five measurement trials of 180 s real time, portable XRF was first used to detect arsenic (As), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) in a variety of rice samples. The same samples were then microwave-digested and used to determine elemental concentrations using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The concentrations of As, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn determined by ICP-MS were found to be consistent with other recent studies involving various types of rice and rice products. When assessing for As, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn, comparison of results between XRF amplitude and ICP-MS concentration (wet weight) demonstrated a linear relationship with a significant correlation.

In case of deoxynivalenol (DON), deoxynivalenol-3-O-β-D-glucoside (D3G) is the most important masked mycotoxin. The toxicological significance of D3G is not yet fully understood so that it is crucial to obtain this compound in pure and sufficient quantities for toxicological risk assessment and for use as an analytical standard. The aim of this study was the biochemical characterization of a DON-inactivating UDP-glucosyltransferase from rice (OsUGT79) and to investigate its suitability for preparative D3G synthesis. Apparent Michaelis constants (Km) of recombinant OsUGT79 were 0.23 mM DON and 2.2 mM UDP-glucose. Substrate inhibition occurred at DON concentrations above 2 mM (Ki = 24 mM DON), and UDP strongly inhibited the enzyme. Cu2+ and Zn2+ (1 mM) inhibited the enzyme completely. Sucrose synthase AtSUS1 was employed to regenerate UDP-glucose during the glucosylation reaction. With this approach, optimal conversion rates can be obtained at limited concentrations of the costly co-factor UDP-glucose. D3G can now be synthesized in sufficient quantity and purity.

Vacuoles occupy a large proportion of the storage parenchyma cells in the sugarcane stem, and the stored products can be harvested as juice by crushing the cane. Hence, for the production of any high-value protein, it could be targeted to the lytic vacuoles so as to extract and purify the protein of interest from the juice. There is no consensus vacuolar-targeting sequence so far to target any heterologous proteins to sugarcane vacuole. Hence, in this study, we identified an N-terminal 78-bp-long putative vacuolar-targeting sequence from the N-terminal domain of unknown function (DUF) in Triticum aestivum 6-SFT (sucrose: fructan 6-fructosyl transferase). In this study, we have generated sugarcane transgenics with gene coding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused with the vacuolar-targeting determinants at the N-terminal driven by a strong constitutive promoter (Port ubi882) and demonstrated the targeting of GFP to the vacuoles. In addition, we have also generated transgenics with His-tagged β-glucuronidase (GUS) and aprotinin targeted to the lytic vacuole, and these two proteins were isolated and purified from the transgenic sugarcane and compared with commercially available protein samples. Our studies have demonstrated that the novel vacuolar-targeting determinant could localize recombinant proteins (r-proteins) to the vacuole in high concentrations and such targeted r-proteins can be purified from the juice with a few simple steps.

However, during storage, the rough rice is vulnerable to insect infestation, resulting in significant economic loss. Previous studies have shown that volatiles cues, physical characteristics, and taste chemicals on the grains could be the important key behavior factors for storage insect pests to locate the hosts and select oviposition sites. It is also well known that the transgenic Bt rough rice line T1C-19, which expresses a cry1C(⁎) gene has a high resistance to Lepidoptera pests. However, there were no evidences to show the consequences of host preference for non-target insect pests after growing Bt transgenic rice. In this study, the potential key factors of Bt rough rice were investigated for their impacts on the behaviors of non-target pest lesser grain borer Rhyzopertha dominica, the main weevil pest of grain and its parasitic wasps Anisopteromalus calandrae, the natural enemy of the beetle. Both electronic nose and electronic tongue analyses showed that the parameters of Bt rough rice were analogous to those of the non-Bt rough rice. The volatile profiles of Bt and non-Bt rough rice examined by gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were similar. For most volatile compounds, there were no significantly quantitative differences in compound quantities between Bt and non-Bt rough rice. The densities of sclereids and trichomes on the rough rice husk surface were statistically equal in Bt and non-Bt rough rice. The non-target pest, R. dominica, and its parasitoid wasp, A. calandrae, were attracted to both rough rice and could not distinguish the transgenic T1C-19 from the isogenic rough rice.

In this study, the potential of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) as a novel and rapid analytical technique to determine 17 free amino acids in CRW were investigated. Genetic algorithms (GA) and synergy interval partial least squares (SiPLS) were used to select the most efficient spectral variables to improve the prediction precision of the classic partial least squares (PLS) model constructed on the full-spectrum. The results demonstrated that compared with the PLS model using all wavelengths of FT-IR spectra, the prediction precision of model based on the spectral variables selected by GA and SiPLS was significantly improved, especially for arginine and proline. After systemic comparison and discussion, it was found that GA-SiPLS model achieved the best performance, with the correlation coefficient in calibration (R(2) (cal)) higher than 0.80 and the residual predictive deviation higher than 2.00 for all of the free amino acids analyzed in this study.

Quantification of trace endogenous phytohormones is essential to elucidate their molecular mechanisms in response to stresses. However, the structural and chemical diversity of phytohormones make it difficult to purify and enrich multiple phytohormones in one-step. In the current study, a method was developed to comprehensively profile phytohormones, including 8 cytokinins (CKs), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and 10 gibberellins (GAs) by Fe3O4@TiO2-based magnetic solid-phase extraction coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (Fe3O4@TiO2-based MSPE-UPLC-MS/MS). In the proposed method, the phytohormones in the acetonitrile extract of plant tissues were captured and purified by one-step MSPE using Fe3O4@TiO2 as a sorbent prior to UPLC-MS/MS analysis. The sensitivity, accuracy and reproducibility of the proposed analytical method were demonstrated to satisfy the profiling of multiple phytohormones in plant tissue. We then further used the Fe3O4@TiO2-based MSPE-UPLC-MS/MS method to explore the change of phytohormones in rice under Cd stress. The results showed that CKs, IAA, ABA, JA and biological active GAs all increased under Cd stress, suggesting that these phytohormones may take part in response to Cd stress.

The generated mAb was further used to develop a simple, fast, and sensitive sandwich dot-ELISA (s-dot ELISA) method for detection of OTA from contaminated food grain samples. The limit of detection (LOD) of the developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was determined as 5.0 ng/mL of OTA. Developed method was more specific toward OTA and no cross reactivity was observed with the other tested mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol, fumonisin B1, or aflatoxin B1. To assess the utility and reliability of the developed method, several field samples of maize, wheat and rice (n = 195) collected from different geographical regions of southern Karnataka region of India were evaluated for the OTA occurrence. Seventy two out of 195 samples (19 maize, 38 wheat, and 15 rice) were found to be contaminated by OTA by s-dot ELISA. The assay results were further co-evaluated with conventional analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Results of the s-dot ELISA are in concordance with HPLC except for three samples that were negative for OTA presence by s-dot ELISA but found positive by HPLC. Although positive by HPLC, the amount of OTA in the three samples was found to be lesser than the accepted levels (>5 μg/kg) of OTA presence in cereals. Therefore, in conclusion, the developed s-dot ELISA is a better alternative for routine cereal based food and feed analysis in diagnostic labs to check the presence of OTA over existing conventional culture based, tedious analytical methods.

26073168,"A highly sensitive method was developed for the detection of phytochelatins (PCs) in rice by stable isotope labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (IL-LC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis. A pair of isotope-labeling reagents [ω-bromoacetonylquinolinium bromide (BQB) and BQB-d(7)] were used to label PCs in plant sample and standard PCs, respectively, and then combined prior to LC/MS analysis. The heavy labeled standards were used as the internal standards for quantitation to minimize the matrix and ion suppression effects in MS analysis. In addition, the ionization efficiency of PCs was greatly enhanced through the introduction of a permanent charged moiety of quaternary ammonium of BQB into PCs. The detection sensitivities of PCs upon BQB labeling improved by 14-750-fold, and therefore, PCs can be quantitated using only 5 mg of plant tissue. Furthermore, under cadmium (Cd) stress, we found that the contents of PCs in rice dramatically increased with the increased concentrations and treatment time of Cd. It was worth noting that PC5 was first identified and quantitated in rice tissues under Cd stress in the current study. Taken together, this IL-LC-ESI-MS/MS method demonstrated to be a promising strategy in detection of PCs in plants with high sensitivity and reliability.

Eight arsenic species, namely, arsenite [As(III)], arsenate [As(V)], monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO), tetramethylarsonium (TeMA), arsenobetaine (AsB) and arsenocholine (AsC), were separated and determined under the proposed conditions. In particular, As(III) and MMAA and DMAA and AsB were completely separated using a newly proposed eluent containing ammonium dihydrogen phosphate. Importantly, the sensitivity changes, in particular those of As(V) and As(III) caused by coexisting elements and by complex matrix composition, which had been problematical in previously reported methods, were eliminated. The new eluent can be applied to C8, C18 and C30 ODS columns with the same effectiveness and with excellent repeatability.

26037615,"We identified key residues of TaHMA2, and the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein have different roles in its transport function when heterologously expressed in yeast. TaHMA2, a P1B-type ATPase from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), plays an important role in heavy metal homeostasis in plants. A previous study showed that overexpressing TaHMA2 in rice (Oryza sativa L.), Arabidopsis thaliana, or tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) resulted in various responses to heavy metals. Here, we report the heterologous expression of TaHMA2 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TaHMA2 expression increased the yeast's sensitivity to Cd, but not to Zn, Pb or Co, and increased Cd accumulation was concurrently observed. The eGFP-TaHMA2 fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane and showed a discontinuous pattern. Mutagenesis of the cysteine and glutamate residues in the N-terminal metal-binding domain (N-MBD) impaired the function of TaHMA2. Deletion of most of the C terminus (TaHMA2ΔC, 712-1003) partially abolished the protein's function, whereas deletion of the N terminus (TaHMA2ΔN, 2-699) completely abolished Cd sensitivity. These data suggest that cysteine and glutamate residues are important for the metal-binding/translocation function of TaHMA2.

26020316,"The objectives were to quantify gastrointestinal tolerance, total tract nutrient digestibility, and serum lipid profiles of dogs as affected by α-cyclodextrin (ACD) supplementation and to validate the accuracy of fat analyses techniques using novel ACD-fat complexes. The ACD was hydrolyzed and free sugars and hydrolyzed monosaccharides were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography. Known amount of fats were complexed with ACD, and fat content of complexes were determined using the ether extraction and acid-hydrolyzed fat methods. Nine mixed-breed hounds were used in a crossover design with 3 periods of 10 d each, including 6 d for diet adaptation and 4 d for fecal collection. Dogs were fed twice daily a diet with poultry byproduct meal and brewer's rice as the main ingredients, and chromic oxide (0.2%) was included as a digestion marker. Dogs were supplemented with either 0, 3, or 6 g of ACD diluted in 15 mL of water twice per day for a total of 0, 6, and 12 g ACD per day. The ACD had a very low free sugar concentration and, once hydrolyzed, released only glucose, as expected. Average daily food intake, fecal output (DM basis), and fecal scores were not significantly different among treatments. Body weight and condition score and serum triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations remained unaltered throughout the duration of the experiment. Dry matter, OM, and fat digestibility coefficients were lower (P < 0.05) for both treatment groups compared to the control. The acid-hydrolyzed fat method was valid to measure fat that was bound to ACD. Intake of ACD lowered fat digestibility somewhat but not to the extent previously reported, without affecting serum lipid concentrations or outcomes related to tolerance. Therefore, ACD supplementation resulted in a small decrease in fat digestibility, but ACD supplementation might have potential in modifying serum lipid profiles.",Journal of animal science,"['D000818', 'D018592', 'D004032', 'D004043', 'D019587', 'D004063', 'D004285', 'D004435', 'D005223', 'D005243', 'D041981', 'D050356', 'D008055', 'D009747', 'D047391']","['Animals', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Digestion', 'Dogs', 'Eating', 'Fats', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipids', 'Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'alpha-Cyclodextrins']","Serum lipid profiles, total tract nutrient digestibility, and gastrointestinal tolerance by dogs of α-cyclodextrin.","[None, None, 'Q000662', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000097', 'Q000187', 'Q000494']","[None, None, 'veterinary', 'pharmacology', None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'blood', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26020316,2016
26019258,"Knowledge of the distribution of selenium (Se) species within plant tissues will assist in understanding the mechanisms of Se uptake and translocation, but in situ analysis of fresh and highly hydrated plant tissues is challenging. Using synchrotron-based fluorescence X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) imaging to provide laterally resolved data, the speciation of Se in fresh roots and leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) supplied with 1 μM of either selenate or selenite was investigated. For plant roots exposed to selenate, the majority of the Se was efficiently converted to C-Se-C compounds (i.e. methylselenocysteine or selenomethionine) as selenate was transported radially through the root cylinder. Indeed, even in the rhizodermis which is exposed directly to the bulk solution, only 12-31% of the Se was present as uncomplexed selenate. The C-Se-C compounds were probably sequestered within the roots, whilst much of the remaining uncomplexed Se was translocated to the leaves-selenate accounting for 52-56% of the total Se in the leaves. In a similar manner, for plants exposed to selenite, the Se was efficiently converted to C-Se-C compounds within the roots, with only a small proportion of uncomplexed selenite observed within the outer root tissues. This resulted in a substantial decrease in translocation of Se from the roots to leaves of selenite-exposed plants. This study provides important information for understanding the mechanisms responsible for the uptake and subsequent transformation of Se in plants.

26003713,"Immunochromatographic test strips (ICTS) are commonly limited to higher concentrations of analytes. This limitation stems from the relatively low sensitivity of conventional gold nanospheres (AuNSs with a diameter of 20 nm) to emit detectable brightness values. The larger multi-branched gold nanoflowers (AuNFs) with a higher optical brightness as well as good colloidal stability exhibit signiﬁcant improvements over conventional AuNSs for enhanced sensitivity of ICTS. In this study, blue AuNFs with an average diameter of 75±5 nm were synthetized and employed as a signal amplification probe for ultrasensitive and quantitative detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in rice. A portable optical strip reader was used to record the optical densities of test and control lines of the strip. Under the optimal conditions, the AuNF based ICTS system accurately detected AFB1 linearly and dynamically over the range of 0.5-25 pg/mL with a half maximal inhibitory concentration at 4.17 pg/mL. The inhibitory concentration was achieved 10 times lower than that of the traditional AuNS based ICTS systems (41.25 pg/mL). The limit of detection for AFB1 in rice extract was achieved at 0.32 pg/mL.

We achieved limit of quantification of 0.5 ppm for gliadin that is 20 times lower than the worldwide limit established for gluten-free food while the method of analysis is faster and cheaper than currently employed ELISA-based methods.

25956648,"The present work report the unusual uranium uptake by foodstuff, especially those rich in carbohydrates like rice when they are cooked in water, contaminated with uranium. The major staple diet in South Asia, rice, was chosen to study its interaction with UO2(2+), the active uranium species in water, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Highest uptake limit was checked by cooking rice at very high uranium concentration and it was found to be good scavenger of uranium. To gain insight into the mechanism of uptake, direct interaction of UO2(2+) with monosaccharides was also studied, using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry taking mannose as a model. The studies have been done with dissolved uranium salt, uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UO2(NO3)2·6H2O), as well as the leachate of a stable oxide of uranium, UO2(s), both of which exist as UO2(2+) in water. Among the eight different rice varieties investigated, Karnataka Ponni showed the maximum uranium uptake whereas unpolished Basmati rice showed the minimum. Interaction with other foodstuffs (potato, carrot, peas, kidney beans and lentils) with and without NaCl affected the extent of chemical interaction but was not consistent with the carbohydrate content. Uranium interaction with D-mannose monitored through ESI-MS, under optimized instrumental parameters, identified the peaks corresponding to uranyl adduct with mannose monomer, dimer and trimer and the species were confirmed by MS/MS studies.

25943499,"A rapid and sensitive method was developed and validated for citrinin determination in red fermented rice products by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) under the selected reaction monitoring mode. Sample preparation was especially focused, and the quantitative methods of LC-MS/MS and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) were compared. In red fermented rice samples, the limit of detection was 1.0 μg/kg for LC-MS/MS compared to 250 μg/kg for HPLC-FLD, the limit of quantification was 3.0 μg/kg for LC-MS/MS compared to 825 μg/kg for HPLC-FLD. High correlation coefficient was obtained (R(2) = 0.999) within the linear range (0.1 to 100 μg/L) in the MS method. The recoveries ranging from 80.9% to 106.5% were obtained in different spiking concentrations. The average intra- and inter-day accuracy ranged from 75.4% to 103.1%, and the intra- and inter-day precisions were from 3.3% to 7.9%. The developed method was applied to 12 commercial red fermented rice products, and citrinin was found in 10 samples ranging from 0.14 to 44.24 mg/kg. Compared to traditional qualitative and quantitative methods, the newly developed LC-MS/MS method for citrinin determination includes the merits of using a small amount of extraction solvent, simple preparation steps, and high sensitivity.

25938012,"Trace element analysis of foods is of increasing importance because of raised consumer awareness and the need to evaluate and establish regulatory guidelines for toxic trace metals and metalloids. This paper reviews recent advances in the analysis of trace elements in food, including challenges, state-of-the-art methods, and use of spatially resolved techniques for localizing the distribution of arsenic and mercury within rice grains. Total elemental analysis of foods is relatively well-established, but the push for ever lower detection limits requires that methods be robust from potential matrix interferences, which can be particularly severe for food. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is the method of choice, allowing for multi-element and highly sensitive analyses. For arsenic, speciation analysis is necessary because the inorganic forms are more likely to be subject to regulatory limits. Chromatographic techniques coupled to ICP-MS are most often used for arsenic speciation, and a range of methods now exist for a variety of different arsenic species in different food matrices. Speciation and spatial analysis of foods, especially rice, can also be achieved with synchrotron techniques.

25922485,"Knowledge of arsenic (As) accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is important for minimizing As transfer to the food chain. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of rice nodes in As storage and distribution. Synchrotron μX-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) was used to map As distribution in the top node and internode of a lsi2 mutant defective in silicon/arsenite efflux carrier and its wild-type (WT) grown in soil. Lsi2 expression in different tissues during grain filling was investigated by quantitative RT-PCR. Arsenite or dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) was supplied to excised panicles to investigate the roles of Lsi2 and phytochelatins (PC) in As distribution. μ-XRF mapping revealed As storage in the phloem of different vascular bundles in the top node and internode. Soil-grown plants of lsi2 had markedly decreased As accumulation in the phloem compared with the WT. Lsi2 was strongly expressed, not only in the roots but also in the nodes. When excised panicles were exposed to As(III), the lsi2 mutant distributed more As to the node and flag leaf but less As to the grain compared with the WT, while there was no significant difference in DMA distribution. Inhibition of PC synthesis by l-buthionine-sulphoximine decreased As(III) deposition in the top node but increased As accumulation in the grain and flag leaf. The results suggest that rice nodes serve as a filter restricting As(III) distribution to the grain. Furthermore, Lsi2 plays a role in As(III) distribution in rice nodes and phytochelatins are important compounds for As(III) storage in the nodes.

25863504,"We compared four methods to extract arsenic (As) from three different plants containing different As levels for As speciation with the goal of developing a more efficient method, i.e., As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata at 459-7714mgkg(-1), rice seedling at 53.4-574mgkg(-1), and tobacco leaf at 0.32-0.35mgkg(-1). The four methods included heating with dilute HNO3, and sonication with phosphate buffered solution, methanol/water, and ethanol/water, with As being analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). Among the four methods, the ethanol/water method produced the most satisfactory extraction efficiency (~80% for the roots and >85% for the fronds) without changing As species based on P. vittata. The lower extraction efficiency from P. vittata roots was attributed to its dominance by arsenate (82%) while arsenite dominated in the fronds (89%). The ethanol/water method used sample:solution ratio of 1:200 (0.05g:10mL) with 50% ethanol and 2h sonication. Based on different extraction times (0.5-2h), ethanol concentrations (25-100%) and sample:solution ratios (1:50-1:300), the optimized ethanol/water method used less ethanol (25%) and time (0.5h for the fronds and 2h for the roots). Satisfactory extraction was also obtained for tobacco leaf (78-92%) and rice seedlings (~70%) using the optimized method, which was better than the other three methods.

The effects of the mixture were class-specific: trends were comparable in dicots but different in monocots. The response induced by the mixture at high concentrations differed from that theoretically obtainable by summing the effects of the individual metals.

25766479,"A new multi-component analysis method based on zero-crossing point-continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) was developed for simultaneous spectrophotometric determination of Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) ions based on the complex formation with 2-benzyl espiro[isoindoline-1,5 oxasolidine]-2,3,4 trione (BSIIOT). The absorption spectra were evaluated with respect to synthetic ligand concentration, time of complexation and pH. Therefore according the absorbance values, 0.015 mmol L(-1) BSIIOT, 10 min after mixing and pH 8.0 were used as optimum values. The complex formation between BSIIOT ligand and the cations Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) by application of rank annihilation factor analysis (RAFA) were investigated. Daubechies-4 (db4), discrete Meyer (dmey), Morlet (morl) and Symlet-8 (sym8) continuous wavelet transforms for signal treatments were found to be suitable among the wavelet families. The applicability of new synthetic ligand and selected mother wavelets were used for the simultaneous determination of strongly overlapped spectra of species without using any pre-chemical treatment. Therefore, CWT signals together with zero crossing technique were directly applied to the overlapping absorption spectra of Cu(2+) and Pb(2+). The calibration graphs for estimation of Pb(2+) and Cu (2+)were obtained by measuring the CWT amplitudes at zero crossing points for Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) at the wavelet domain, respectively. The proposed method was validated by simultaneous determination of Cu(2+) and Pb(2+) ions in red beans, walnut, rice, tea and soil samples. The obtained results of samples with proposed method have been compared with those predicted by partial least squares (PLS) and flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS).","Spectrochimica acta.

25704687,The solubilization of rice protein isolates (RPIs) has been regarded as one of the critical and challenging processes affecting commercial availability. Simultaneous treatment with freezing and milling (freeze-milling) combined with alkali pretreatment can remarkably increase the maximum achievable amounts of soluble RPIs by up to 42 times. This study investigates the mechanism of solubilization of RPIs by freeze-milling (RPI(fm)). Structural analyses reveal that milling causes proteins to unfold with ice crystals formed inside protein bodies. Fluorescent and Fourier transform infrared spectra show that RPI(fm) possesses disrupted hydrophobic surface and exposed hydrophilic inner groups. Size exclusion chromatography results reveal that RPI(fm) exhibits disaggregation and strong water-protein interactions.

PCR analyses of the expression levels of Cd and Si transporters in rice cells showed that, when the Si concentration in the medium was increased, expression of the Si transporter gene Low silicon rice 1 (Lsi1) was up-regulated, whereas expression of the gene encoding the transporter involved in the transport of Cd, Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 5 (Nramp5), was down-regulated. ICP-MS results revealed that 64% of the total Si in the cell walls was bound to hemicellulose constituents following the fractionation of the cell walls, and consequently inhibited Cd uptake. Furthermore, AFM in KPFM demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the wall surface potential was higher in cells cultured in the presence of Si than in those cultured in its absence, and was homogenized after the addition of Cd. These results suggest that a hemicellulose-bound form of Si with net negative charges is responsible for inhibition of Cd uptake in rice cells by a mechanism of [Si-hemicellulose matrix]Cd complexation and subsequent co-deposition.

25626153,"Thiamethoxam and chlorantraniliprole insecticides have been important tools for controlling pests in rice. However, food safety issues related to pesticide residues are important to consider with a food crop such as rice. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze thiamethoxam and chlorantraniliprole residues in rice hull, bran, and polished rice grains. The study was conducted during the 2012 cropping season at the Texas A&M Agrilife Research, David R. Wintermann Rice Research Station, near Eagle Lake, TX, USA. Rice was planted on May 5, 2012, using the cultivar 'Presidio'. Pesticide applications were performed at 5, 15, 25, and 35 days after flowering (DAF) using 1 and 2 times the recommended rate of 30 g active ingredient (ai) ha(-1) for thiamethoxam and 30 g ai ha(-1) for chlorantraniliprole. Sequentially, two treatments using the insecticides at recommended rate were applied at 5 and 25 DAF and at 5, 25, and 35 DAF. Insecticide residues were analyzed in different sample fractions: rice hull, bran, and polished rice grains. The samples were subjected to extraction using an accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) technique. Sample aliquots were analyzed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5 × 10(-5) mg kg(-1).

25597681,"Pot and field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of water regimes on the speciation and accumulation of arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) in Brazilian upland rice growing in soils polluted with both As and Cd. In the pot experiment constant and intermittent flooding treatments gave 3-16 times higher As concentrations in soil solution than did aerobic conditions but Cd showed the opposite trend. Compared to arsenate, there were more marked changes in the arsenite concentrations in the soil solution as water management shifted, and therefore arsenite concentrations dominated the As speciation and bioavailability in the soil. In the field experiment As concentrations in the rice grains increased from 0.14 to 0.21 mg/kg while Cd concentrations decreased from 0.21 to 0.02 mg/kg with increasing irrigation ranging from aerobic to constantly flooding conditions. Among the various water regimes the conventional irrigation treatment produced the highest rice grain yield of 6.29 tons/ha. The As speciation analysis reveals that the accumulation of dimethylarsinic acid (from 11.3% to 61.7%) made a greater contribution to the increase in total As in brown rice in the intermittent and constant flooding treatments compared to the intermittent-aerobic treatment. Thus, water management exerted opposite effects on Cd and As speciation and bioavailability in the soil and consequently on their accumulation in the upland rice.

29363933,"Mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA) is a widespread contaminant of raw cereal grains with nephrotoxic activity. Сereal-based baby foods (BF) are an important component of the infant diet. In Russia, the presence of OTA in grainbased BF is not allowed (<0.5 ng/kg), in the EU maximum limit of toxin in BF is 0.5 ng/kg. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) set for OTA a provisional tolerable weekly intake of 100 ng/kg bw; the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) – 120 ng/kg bw. The purpose of this study was to investigate the OTA content in BF (infant cereals and canned food) and assess the relevant risk to the health of children first year of life. The analysis of OTA was performed by immunoaffinity column clean-up and high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The limit of detection and limit of quantification for OTA were 0.10 and 0.50 ng/kg, respectively. The content of OTA in BF was represented as maximum (Max), mean (M), median (Мe) and 90 percentile (90%) of all samples. The 554 BF samples based on corn, rice, buckwheat, millet, wheat, oats, barley, and mixtures of cereals were studied. OTA was detected in 32 samples of BF: in 30 of the 312 samples of infant cereals (Max – 4.95 ng/kg; M – 0.09 ng/kg, Me and 90% – 0 ng/kg) and in 2 of the 242 samples of canned food (0.34 and 0.37 ng/kg). 20 samples of BF were contaminated with OTA above the maximum limit (≥0.50 ng/kg). BF, exhibited the highest incidence of OTA, were buckwheat-based (13 of 41 samples, Max – 2.52 ng/kg, M – 0.36 ng/kg, Me – 0 ng/kg, 90% – 1.57 ng/kg) and mixed-grain (12 of 115 samples, Max – 4.95 ng/kg, M – 0.10 ng/kg, Me – 0 ng/kg, 90% – 0.14 ng/kg) infant cereals. OTA was also detected in 2 of 40 samples of oat-based infant cereals (0.19 and 0.60 ng/kg), in 2 of 72 samples of rice-based infant cereals (0.18 and 0.48 ng/kg) and in 1 of 37 samples of wheat-based infant cereals (0.13 ng/kg). None of the 4 samples of corn-based and of the 3 samples of millet-based infant cereals contained OTA. Calculations showed that for infants the daily ochratoxin A dietary intake did not exceed 6.8 ng/kg bw. This value of OTA intake is below the levels, proposed as tolerable intake. Thus, one can conclude that cereal-based BF (infant cereals and canned food) are moderately contaminated with OTA and there is not a significant toxicological risk to the health of children of first year of life.

The synthesis mechanism of the h-MIMs has been studied. The h-MIMs exhibited bigger specific surface area and much higher binding capacity than the molecularly imprinted polymers prepared by precipitation polymerization (p-MIPs) and surface polymerization (s-MIPs). Besides, the adsorption rate of h-MIMs to prometryn was significantly higher than that of p-MIPs and s-MIPs. Owing to the hollow structure of the h-MIMs, more binding cavities were located on the inner and outer surfaces of the h-MIMs, which could facilitate the removal of template molecules from the polymers and the rebinding of the target molecules to the polymers. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limits of triazines are in the range of 0.08-0.16ngg(-1). At the spiked level (5ngg(-1)), the recoveries of triazines are in the range of 81±4% to 96±4%.

Soil washing (0.5 M phosphate solution for 2 h) removed 24.5% As, on average, in soil from both locations. Regardless of soil washing, Location A soil toxicities, determined using Microtox, were greater than that of Location B and this could be largely attributed to different soil particle size distribution. With soils from both locations, the changes in As chemical forms resulted in either similar or greater toxicities after washing. This emphasizes the importance of considering ecotoxicological aspects, which are likely to differ depending on soil particle size distribution and changes in As chemical forms, in addition to the total concentration based remedial goals, in producing ecotoxicologically-sound soils for reuse.

The chemical fractions of Cd in soils with natural sources are probably controlled by parent materials and mostly in residual phase.

Leafy vegetable tends to accumulate more Cd than the other crops. The calculated Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) had a much higher value (4.33) for Cd, suggesting that Cd represents a significant potential risk to the local population. The urinary Cd concentrations (mean at 3.92 μg L(-1) for male and 4.85 μg L(-1) for female) of inhabitants in the study area were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those from the control area (mean at 0.8 μg L(-1) for male and 0.42 μg L(-1) for female). Male and female test subjects had similar urinary Cd levels (p>0.05), but age seemed to lead to an increase in Cd in the urine. These findings show that naturally-occurring Cd in local soils is taken up appreciably by local food crops, and that dietary exposure of Cd through vegetable ingestion is a major exposure pathway for local populations, and a potential risk to public health in the study area.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,"['D000328', 'D002104', 'D002681', 'D002523', 'D004784', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D008875', 'D018570', 'D012989', 'D014675', 'D014874', 'D055815']","['Adult', 'Cadmium', 'China', 'Edible Grain', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Assessment', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Vegetables', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Young Adult']",Potential health risk in areas with high naturally-occurring cadmium background in southwestern China.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None]","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25463862,2015
25463210,"In most cases of mycotoxin detection, quantitation is critical while immunochromatographic strip tests are qualitative in nature. Moreover, the sensitivity of this technique is questioned. In order to overcome these limitations, an ultrasensitive and quantitative immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for rapid and sensitive quantitation of ochratoxin A (OTA) was developed. The assay was based on a competitive format and its sensitivity was improved by using a sensitive and selective OTA monoclonal antibody (OTA-mAb). The visible ICA results were obtained within 15 min, and in addition to visual examination, they were read by the rapid color intensity portable strip reader. The visual and computational detection limits (vLOD and cLOD, respectively) for ochratoxin A were 0.2 and 0.25 ng mL(-1), respectively. These values were lower than those reported by previous studies in a range 5-2500 folds. For validation, contaminated samples including wheat, maize, rice and soybean were assayed by ICA and a standard high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results were in good agreement for both ICA and HPLC methods. The average recoveries of the HPLC were in the range 72-120% while the ICA values were from 76 to 104%, confirming the accuracy and sensitivity of this method.","Journal of chromatography.

Firstly, a cooling step immediately before and after the vaporization step in the ETV temperature program resulted in a much sharper analyte signal peak. Secondly, point-by-point internal standardization with an Ar emission line significantly improved the linearity of calibration curves obtained with an increasing amount of rice flour certified reference material (CRM). Under the optimized conditions, detection limits ranged from 0.01 to 6ngg(-1) in the solid, depending on the element and wavelength selected. The method was validated through the quantitative analysis of corn bran and wheat flour CRMs. Application of the method to the multi-elemental analysis of 4-mg aliquots of real organic long grain rice (white and brown) also gave results for Al, As, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Se, Pb and Zn in agreement with those obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry following acid digestion of 0.2-g aliquots. As the analysis takes roughly 5min per sample (2.5min for grinding, 0.5-1min for weighing a 4-mg aliquot and 87s for the ETV program), this approach shows great promise for fast screening of food samples.

In this paper, a direct, rapid and sensitive method was developed for simultaneous quantification of unbound cysteine (Cys), glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins (PCs) in rice leaf, stem and root samples by hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS). Homogenized samples were extracted with water containing 50mM dithiothreitol, without derivatization and further clean-up, and the extracts were injected directly onto an Xbridge Amide-HILIC column (3.5μm, 150mm×2.1mm i.d.). The best chromatographic separation and MS sensitivity was achieved using a linear gradient elution with 10mM aqueous ammonium formate and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. In MS/MS mode the detection limit (S/N≥3) of seven biothiols was 3-105nM. Good linearities were observed (r>0.995) with linear dynamic range at least over three orders of magnitude. Recoveries for most analytes were within the range of 77-128%, with relative standard deviations less than 18.2%. The intra-day precision (n=7) was 6.1-11.7%, and the inter-day precision over 15 d (n=15) was 8.5-16.3% for all biothiols. The optimized HILIC-MS/MS method was applied to study the influence of different cadmium (Cd) concentrations (0, 1 and 50μM) on contents of Cys, GSH and PC2-6 in rice tissue. With increasing Cd concentrations in nutrient solutions, contents of PC2-4 in rice roots increased but contents of Cys and GSH decreased. Contents of PC2-4 in both rice leafs and stems increased markedly at high dose Cd (50μM) treatment compared with controls, compared with low Cd concentrations (1μM).

In a survey of F. graminearum (sensu stricto) on wheat in North America several novel strains were isolated, which produced none of the known trichothecene mycotoxins despite causing normal disease symptoms. In rice cultures, a new trichothecene mycotoxin (named NX-2) was characterized by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements identified NX-2 as 3α-acetoxy-7α,15-dihydroxy-12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene. Compared with the well-known 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-ADON), it lacks the keto group at C-8 and hence is a type A trichothecene. Wheat ears inoculated with the isolated strains revealed a 10-fold higher contamination with its deacetylated form, named NX-3, (up to 540 mg kg(-1) ) compared with NX-2. The toxicities of the novel mycotoxins were evaluated utilizing two in vitro translation assays and the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. NX-3 inhibits protein biosynthesis to almost the same extent as the prominent mycotoxin deoxynivalenol, while NX-2 is far less toxic, similar to 3-ADON. Genetic analysis revealed a different TRI1 allele in the N-isolates, which was verified to be responsible for the difference in hydroxylation at C-8.

Additionally, undetected impurities found in recombinant proteins used in cell culture may adversely impact basic research and biotechnology applications. Currently, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the standard for detection of residual HCP contamination in recombinantly produced biologics. Alternatively, two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry is being developed as a tool for assessing this critical quality attribute. Both of these methods rely on the direct detection of HCPs and some previous knowledge of the contaminant. For contaminating enzymes, the mass level of the impurity may fall below the threshold of detection of these methods and underestimate the true impact. To address this point, here we demonstrate facile detection and characterization of contaminating phytase activity in rice-derived recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) using a sensitive, label-free nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy assay. We observed varying degrees of phytase contamination in biotechnology-grade rHSA from various manufacturers by monitoring the degradation of adenosine-5'-triphosphate and myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate by (31)P NMR.

The ks(Extract) value (1.26 × 10(-2) M(-1) s(-1)) of Nipponbare (extract 1) with the highest activity was 1.5 times larger than that (8.29 × 10(-3)) of Milyang-23 (extract 7) with the lowest activity. The concentrations (in mg/100 g) of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Tocs and -Toc-3s and γ-oryzanol found in the seven extracts 1-7 were determined using HPLC-MS/MS and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, respectively. From the results, it has been clarified that the ArO•-scavenging rates (ks(Extract)) (that is, the relative ARAC value) obtained for the seven extracts 1-7 may be approximately explained as the sum of the product {Σ ks(AOH-i) [AOH-i]/10(5)} of the rate constant (ks(AOH-i)) and the concentration ([AOH-i]/10(5)) of AOH-i (Tocs, Toc-3s, and γ-oryzanol) included in rice bran extracts.

25260190,"Recent studies have shown that there are detectable levels of arsenic (As) in rice, rice food products, and apple juice. This has created significant concern to the public, the food industry, and various regulatory bodies. Classic test methods typically measure total As and are unable to differentiate the various As species. Since different As species have greatly different toxicities, an analytical method was needed to separate and quantify the different inorganic and organic species of As. The inorganic species arsenite [As(+3)] and arsenate [As(+5)] are highly toxic. With this in mind, an ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma (IC-ICP/MS) method was developed and validated for rice and rice food products that can separate and individually measure multiple inorganic and organic species of As. This allows for the evaluation of the safety or risk associated with any product analyzed. The IC-ICP/MS method was validated on rice and rice food products, and it has been used successfully on apple juice.

As cumulative poisons, consumption of Pb and Cd in contaminated rice may cause many toxic effects in humans. In the present study, Pb and Cd levels in rice samples from Hubei, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, and Guangdong provinces in China were analyzed by cloud point extraction and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). The heavy metals in the rice samples were reacted with 8-quinolinol to form a complex at pH 9.0 and 40°C. Analytes were quantitatively extracted to a surfactant-rich phase (Triton X-45) after centrifugation and analyzed by GFAAS. The effects of experimental conditions, including pH, concentration of reagents, and equilibration time and temperature, on cloud point extraction were optimized efficiently using Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken experimental designs.

25213401,"Oxidation of histidine by (1)O2 is an important process associated with oxidative damage to proteins during aging, diseases and photodynamic therapy of tumors and jaundice, and photochemical transformations of biological species in the troposphere. However, the oxidation mechanisms and products of histidine differ dramatically in these related environments which range from the gas phase through aerosols to aqueous solution. Herein we report a parallel gas- and solution-phase study on the (1)O2 oxidation of histidine, aimed at evaluating the evolution of histidine oxidation pathways in different media and at different ionization states. We first investigated the oxidation of protonated and deprotonated histidine ions and the same systems hydrated with explicit water molecules in the gas phase, using guided-ion-beam-scattering mass spectrometry. Reaction coordinates and potential energy surfaces for these systems were established on the basis of density functional theory calculations, Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus modeling and direct dynamics simulations. Subsequently we tracked the oxidation process of histidine in aqueous solution under different pH conditions, using on-line UV-Vis spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry monitoring systems. The results show that two different routes contribute to the oxidation of histidine depending on its ionization states. In each mechanism hydration is essential to suppressing the otherwise predominant dissociation of reaction intermediates back to reactants. The oxidation of deprotonated histidine in the gas phase involves the formation of 2,4-endoperoxide and 2-hydroperoxide of imidazole. These intermediates evolve to hydrated imidazolone in solution, and the latter either undergoes ring-closure to 6α-hydoxy-2-oxo-octahydro-pyrrolo[2,3-d]imidazole-5-carboxylate or cross-links with another histidine to form a dimeric product. In contrast, the oxidation of protonated histidine is mediated by 2,5-endoperoxide and 5-hydroperoxide, which convert to stable hydrated imidazolone end-product in solution. The contrasting mechanisms and reaction efficiencies of protonated vs. deprotonated histidine, which lead to pH dependence in the photooxidation of histidine, are interpreted in terms of the chemistry of imidazole with (1)O2. The biological implications of the results are also discussed.

Some pesticides gave tailing peaks, but these peaks became sharp and symmetrical when polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 was added to the test solution. Recovery tests were performed on nine kinds of agricultural products (brown rice, soybean, spinach, cabbage, potato, orange, apple, strawberry, and Japanese pear) fortified with 170 pesticides at 0.01 and 0.1 μg/g. Each concentration of pesticide residue was extracted from 2 samples on 5 separate days. The trueness of the method for 147-164 pesticides in each sample was 70-120% with satisfactory repeatability and within-run reproducibility. This method is expected to useful for multi-residue analysis of pesticides in agricultural products. ",Shokuhin eiseigaku zasshi.

25190053,"The mycotoxin citreoviridin has been associated with the 'yellow rice' disease, which caused cardiac beriberi in Japan. In Brazil, the consumption of contaminated rice was suspected to be involved in a recent beriberi outbreak. In this work, citreoviridin was produced by Penicillium citreonigrum, cultivated in 500 ml yeast extract sucrose (YES) liquid medium for 8 days at 25ºC, and the toxin extracted with chloroform from the liquid medium and the mycelium. A total of 15.3 g of crude extract was obtained from 48 culture flasks, with an estimated citreoviridin contend of 5.54 g, 74.3% being present in the mycelia. Semi-preparative HPLC of the crude extract yielded 27.1% citreoviridin. The HPLC-purified citreoviridin fraction was fully characterised by UV/VIS, FT-IR, (1)H- and (13)C-NMR, LC-MS/MS and LC-MSD TOF, and purity confirmed by gravimetric analysis. Isocitreoviridin was also produced by P. citreonigrum, accounting for about 10% of the citreoviridin present in the crude extract, most transformed into citreoviridin after 10 months under freezing conditions protected from light. Citreoviridin was shown to be stable under the same conditions, although it can suffer isomerisation after a longer storage period. Isomerisation is a potential source of variability in toxicological studies and purity of the material should be checked before study initiation.","Food additives & contaminants.

Depending on the Monascus strains and the fermentation conditions, the products may contain monacolins, pigments and citrinin as secondary metabolites. Authentic and commercial RYR samples were analyzed using UHPLC-DAD-QToF-MS for monacolins, pigments and citrinin. A separation by UHPLC was achieved using a reversed-phase column and a gradient of water/acetonitrile each containing formic acid as the mobile phase. Accurate mass QToF spectrometry was used to distinguish isobaric monacolins. Principle component analysis (PCA), a chemometric technique was used to discriminate between authentic RYR, commercial RYR raw materials and dietary supplements. Three authentic RYR samples, 31 commercial RYR raw materials and 14 RYR dietary supplements were analyzed. Monacolin K content in 600mg of authentic RYR samples ranged from 1.2mg to 1.38mg. Amounts of monacolin K in dietary supplements labeled as containing 600mg of RYR varied more than 40-fold from 0.03mg to 2.18mg. Monacolin K content of dietary supplements labeled as containing 1200mg RYR varied more than 20-fold from 0.22mg to 5.23mg. In addition to large variations in quantity of monacolin K found in dietary supplements, RYR dietary supplements contained ratios of monacolins that differed significantly from authentic samples.

The extraction efficiencies for total arsenic species and especially for arsenite [As(III)] and arsenate [As(V)] were investigated. As(III), As(V) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA) were found in the samples, and the concentration of DMAA did not vary with treatment conditions. However, the concentrations of extracted total arsenic and those of As(III) and As(V) depended on the extracting solvents. When an extracting solvent was highly acidic, the concentrations of extracted total arsenic were in good agreement with the total arsenic concentration determined by ICP-MS after microwave-assisted digestion, though a part of the As(V) was reduced to As(III) during the highly acidic extraction process. Extraction under neutral conditions increased the extracted As(V), but extracted total arsenic was decreased because a part of the As(III) could not be extracted. Optimum conditions for the extraction of As(III) and As(V) from rice flour samples are discussed to allow the accurate determinations of As(III), As(V) and DMAA in the rice flour samples.

When Cd(2+) is added to the stable mixture of AuNPs, GSH, and NaCl, Cd(2+) can coordinate with 4× GSH as a spherical shaped complex, which decreases the amount of free GSH on the surface of gold nanoparticles to weaken the stability of AuNPs, and AuNPs will easily aggregate in high-salt conditions.

The present study was aimed to compare four different techniques; thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the analysis of aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁), B₂ (AFB₂), G₁ (AFG₁) and G₂ (AFG₂) in brown rice (n = 120) being collected from Karachi, Pakistan. All the four assays provide precised, accurate and comparable results. However, some differences were observed. For instance, TLC, HPLC and LC-MS/MS methodologies offered the advantage of the quantification of individual toxins in contrast to ELISA technique. The contamination ranges of AFB₁/AFB₂ as determined by TLC, HPLC and LC-MS/MS were 1.18-9.97/0.59-1.52, 0.16-10.54/0.26-1.35 and 0.11-10.88/0.38-1.48 µg/kg, respectively. However, AFG₁ and AFG₂ were not detected in any tested samples. Furthermore, owing to low-detection limit and sensitivity, HPLC and LC-MS/MS methodologies have identified greater number of contaminated samples in comparison to TLC and ELISA techniques. The overall average results of total AFs as provided by HPLC (3.79 µg/kg) and LC-MS/MS (3.89 µg/kg) were found higher in comparison to TLC (3.68 µg/kg) and ELISA (3.70 µg/kg).

About 300 compounds have been identified in sake, and the contribution of individual components to the sake flavor has been examined at the same time. However, only a few compounds could explain the characteristics alone and most of the attributes still remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the component profile and the attributes of sake. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based non-targeted analysis was employed to obtain the low molecular weight component profile of Japanese sake including both nonvolatile and volatile compounds. Sake attributes and overall quality were assessed by analytical descriptive sensory test and the prediction model of the sensory score from the component profile was constructed by means of orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS) regression analysis. Our results showed that 12 sake attributes [ginjo-ka (aroma of premium ginjo sake), grassy/aldehydic odor, sweet aroma/caramel/burnt odor, sulfury odor, sour taste, umami, bitter taste, body, amakara (dryness), aftertaste, pungent/smoothness and appearance] and overall quality were accurately explained by component profiles. In addition, we were able to select statistically significant components according to variable importance on projection (VIP). Our methodology clarified the correlation between sake attribute and 200 low molecular components and presented the importance of each component thus, providing new insights to the flavor study of sake.

25047236,"In the developing endosperm of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), seed storage proteins are produced on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to protein bodies, specialized vacuoles for the storage of protein. The functionally important gluten proteins of wheat are transported by two distinct routes to the protein bodies where they are stored: vesicles that bud directly off the ER and transport through the Golgi. However, little is known about the processing of glutenin and gliadin proteins during these steps or the possible impact on their properties. In plants, the RabD GTPases mediate ER-to-Golgi vesicle transport. Available sequence information for Rab GTPases in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium and bread wheat was compiled and compared to identify wheat RabD orthologs. Partial genetic sequences were assembled using the first draft of the Chinese Spring wheat genome. A suitable candidate gene from the RabD clade (TaRabD2a) was chosen for down-regulation by RNA interference (RNAi), and an RNAi construct was used to transform wheat plants. All four available RabD genes were shown by qRT-PCR to be down-regulated in the transgenic developing endosperm. The transgenic grain was found to produce flour with significantly altered processing properties when measured by farinograph and extensograph. SE-HPLC found that a smaller proportion of HMW-GS and large proportion of LMW-GS are incorporated into the glutenin macropolymer in the transgenic dough.

We developed a rapid and simple method to determine the Tinopal CBS-X content in rice noodles and rice papers using HPLC equipped with fluorescence detection. Heating the rice noodles and rice papers to 80°C after adding 75% methanol solution induced the release of Tinopal CBS-X from processed rice products. Tinopal CBS-X was separated using an isocratic mobile phase comprising 50% acetonitrile/water containing 0.4% tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulphate at pH 8.0. The samples suspected to be positive by HPLC analysis were then confirmed by LC-MS/MS analysis. This study also investigated the Tinopal CBS-X content of three rice noodle products and two rice papers. The limits of quantification for rice papers and rice noodles were 1.58 and 1.51 µg kg(-1), respectively, and their correlation curves showed good linearity with r(2) ≥ 0.9997 and ≥ 0.9998, respectively. Moreover, rice papers had recoveries of 70.3-83.3% with precision ranging from 5.0% to 7.9%, whereas rice noodles had slightly lower recoveries of 63.4-78.7% and precisions of 8.5-11.5%. Only one rice noodle product contained Tinopal CBS-X, at around 2.1 mg kg(-1), whereas it was not detected in four other samples. Consequently, Tinopal CBS-X from rice noodles and rice papers can be successfully detected using the developed pre-treatment and ion-pairing HPLC system coupled with fluorescence detection.","Food additives & contaminants.

25008039,"Arsenic (As) is a ubiquitously present environmental carcinogen that enters into the human food chain through rice grains. In our previous research, the application of thiourea (TU; a non-physiological thiol based ROS scavenger) has been demonstrated to enhance salt and UV stress tolerance as well as the crop yield under field conditions. These effects were associated with the ability of TU to maintain plant redox homeostasis. Since As stress also induces redox imbalance, the present research was initiated to evaluate the efficiency of TU in regulating As tolerance/accumulation in rice. The supplementation of TU (75 μM) to As(V) (25 μM) improved the root growth and also reduced the As concentration by 56% in the aerial parts, which could be attributed to significant downregulation of the Lsi2 transporter responsible for the translocation of As from root to shoot. The fact that these effects were not due to direct interaction between As and TU was confirmed from complexation studies using HPLC-(ICP-MS)-(ESI-MS). Short-term kinetic studies of GSH levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio confirmed the establishment of differential redox states in As and As + TU treated seedlings. The real-time RT-PCR based comparative expression profiling under As with/without TU treatment identified Sultr1;1 and Sultr1;2 as major redox-regulated sulfate transporters. Their specific induction in shoots coupled with enhanced root-to-shoot sulfate translocation (analyzed using (35)S-sulfate as a radiotracer) was observed under TU supplementation. Furthermore, the level of thiolic metabolites (PC2 in roots and GSH and PC3 in shoots) and activities of sulfur metabolism enzymes (ATP sulfurylase and cysteine synthase in roots and 5'-adenylylsulfate reductase in shoot) were also increased with As + TU as compared to As treatment. Thus, this study utilizes the interaction between As and TU to identify the critical redox regulated components of As tolerance in rice.

Surface areas and pore volumes of the biochars were inversely correlated to the lignin content of raw biomass. The biochars derived from crop straws displayed more developed pore structure than wood char due to the higher lignin content of wood. Sorption capacity of the biochars to Cd(II) followed the order of corn straw>cotton straw>wheat straw>rice straw>poplar shaving, which was not strictly consistent with the surface area of the chars. The surface characteristics of chars before and after Cd(II) sorption were investigated with scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, which suggested that the higher sorption of Cd(II) on corn straw chars was mainly attributed to cation exchange, surface precipitation of carbonate, and surface complexation with oxygen-containing groups.

24822269,"The defence response of Zantedeschia aethiopica, a natural rhizomatous host of the soft rot bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum, was studied following the activation of common induced resistance pathways—systemic acquired resistance and induced systemic resistance. Proteomic tools were used, together with in vitro quantification and in situ localization of selected oxidizing enzymes. In total, 527 proteins were analysed by label-free mass spectrometry (MS) and annotated against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant (nr) protein database of rice (Oryza sativa). Of these, the fore most differentially expressed group comprised 215 proteins that were primed following application of methyl jasmonate (MJ) and subsequent infection with the pathogen. Sixty-five proteins were down-regulated following MJ treatments. The application of benzothiadiazole (BTH) increased the expression of 23 proteins; however, subsequent infection with the pathogen repressed their expression and did not induce priming. The sorting of primed proteins by Gene Ontology protein function category revealed that the primed proteins included nucleic acid-binding proteins, cofactor-binding proteins, ion-binding proteins, transferases, hydrolases and oxidoreductases. In line with the highlighted involvement of oxidoreductases in the defence response, we determined their activities, priming pattern and localization in planta. Increased activities were confined to the area surrounding the pathogen penetration site, associating these enzymes with the induced systemic resistance afforded by the jasmonic acid signalling pathway.

24770873,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a highly toxic fungal metabolite having carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on human and animal health. Accidental feeding of aflatoxin-contaminated rice straw may be detrimental for ruminant livestock and can lead to transmission of this toxin or its metabolites into the milk of dairy cattle. White-rot basidiomycetous fungus Pleurotus ostreatus produces ligninolytic enzymes like laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP). These extracellular enzymes have been reported to degrade many environmentally hazardous compounds. The present study examines the ability of P. ostreatus strains to degrade AFB1 in rice straw in the presence of metal salts and surfactants. Laccase and MnP activities were determined spectrophotometrically. The efficiency of AFB1 degradation was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography. Highest degradation was recorded for both P. ostreatus MTCC 142 (89.14 %) and P. ostreatus GHBBF10 (91.76 %) at 0.5 µg mL(-1) initial concentration of AFB1. Enhanced degradation was noted for P. ostreatus MTCC 142 in the presence of Cu(2+) and Triton X-100, at toxin concentration of 5 µg mL(-1).

24750809,"Strain HD1 with antifungal activity was isolated from kimchi and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum. Antifungal compounds from Lb. plantarum HD1 were active against food- and feed-borne filamentous fungi and yeasts in a spot-on-the-lawn assay. Antifungal activity of Lb. plantarum HD1 was stronger against filamentous fungi than yeast. Antifungal compounds were purified using solid phase extraction (SPE) and recycling preparative-HPLC. Structures of the antifungal compounds were elucidated by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Active compounds from Lb. plantarum HD1 were identified as 5-oxododecanoic acid (MW 214), 3-hydroxy decanoic acid (MW 188), and 3-hydroxy-5-dodecenoic acid (MW 214). To investigate the potential application of these antifungal compounds for reduction of fungal spoilage in foods, Korean draft rice wine was used as a food model. White film-forming yeasts were observed in control draft rice wine after 11 days of incubation. However, film-forming yeasts were not observed in draft rice wine treated with SPE-prepared culture supernatant of Lb. plantarum HD1 (equivalent to 2.5% addition of culture supernatant) until 27 days of incubation. The addition of antifungal compounds to Korean draft rice wine extended shelf-life up to 27 days at 10 °C without any sterilization process. Therefore, the antifungal activity of Lb. plantarum HD1 may lead to the development of powerful biopreservative systems capable of preventing food- and feed-borne fungal spoilage.

Rice plants take up arsenate As(V) via the phosphate transport pathways, though it is not known how As(V), as compared to phosphate, modifies the expression of phosphate transporters (PTs). Therefore, the impact of As(V) or phosphate (Pi) on the gene expression of PTs and several Pi signaling regulators was investigated. Rice plants were grown on medium containing different As(V) or Pi concentrations. Growth was evaluated and the expression of tested genes was quantified at different time points, using quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). The As and P content in plants was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). As(V) elicited diverse and opposite responses of different PTs in roots and shoots, while Pi triggered a more shallow and uniform transcriptional response in several tested genes. Only a restricted set of genes, including PT2, PT3, PT5 and PT13 and two SPX-MFS family members, was particularly responsive to As(V). Despite some common reactions, the responses of the analyzed genes were predominantly ion-specific. The possible reasons and consequences are discussed.

The presence of this fungus is often linked to the occurrence of several mycotoxins in barley and wheat. The aim of our study was to characterize trichothecene genotypes and production profiles of F. graminearum sensu stricto isolates obtained from barley grains in Argentina. A total of 110 F. graminearum s.s. isolates were analyzed by PCR assays to predict deoxynivalenol (DON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) and nivalenol (NIV) production, and all isolates were found to belong to the same molecular 15-ADON genotype. Trichothecene production in autoclaved rice was analyzed by using gas chromatography (GC) and confirmed by GC-MS. Of the 110 isolates, 95% were able to produce DON, 71% produced 15-ADON, 63% 3-ADON and 52% NIV. With the exception of a single isolate, all isolates that produced NIV, also produced DON. However, the NIV production was very low, ranging from 0.13 to 0.30 μg/g. Six different production profiles of DON and its acetyl-derivatives were detected, the predominant being simultaneous production of DON, 3-ADON and 15-ADON, followed by DON production, and DON and 15-ADON co-production.

Owing to both indigenous As within the soil and the possible increases arising from the onset of irrigation with groundwater, an assessment of As in rice within Cambodia is needed, which offers a ""base-case"" comparison against sediments of similar origin that comprise rice paddy soils where As-contaminated water is used for irrigation (e.g., Bangladesh). Here, we evaluated the As content of rice from five provinces (Kandal, Prey Veng, Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Kampong Thom) in the rice-growing regions of Cambodia and coupled that data to soil-chemical factors based on extractions of paddy soil collected and processed under anoxic conditions. At total soil As concentrations ranging 0.8 to 18 μg g(-1), total grain As concentrations averaged 0.2 μg g(-1) and ranged from 0.1 to 0.37 with Banteay Meanchey rice having significantly higher values than Prey Veng rice. Overall, soil-extractable concentrations of As, Fe, P, and Si and total As were poor predictors of grain As concentrations.

While wild-type cells adhering on plastic surfaces and onion peels changed morphologically from single cells to elongated ones for a short period of about 4 h and 1 day, respectively, ΔPaEMT1 cells did not. Microscopic observation of both strains grown on plant leaf surfaces verified that the wild type colonized a significantly bigger area than that of ΔPaEMT1. However, when MELs were exogenously added to the mutant cells on plant surfaces, their colonized area became enlarged. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed a secretion of higher amount of MELs in the cell suspension incubated with wheat leaf cuttings compared to that in the suspension without cuttings.

However, the arsenic species distribution between rice and bran is still unknown, especially for arsenite (AsIII) and arsenate (AsV). To characterize the arsenic species in rice and bran and explain the elevated concentrations of inorganic arsenic and total arsenic, four arsenic species, AsIII, AsV, dimethylarsinic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid, were evaluated. Rice and bran samples (n = 108) purchased from local markets in the People's Republic of China were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with hydride generation and atomic fluorescence spectrometry and then microwave extraction. As expected, most of the arsenic was found in bran, with bran/rice ratios of 6.8 for total arsenic species and 6.4 for inorganic arsenic. Among four arsenic species, the maximum bran/rice ratio was 104.7 (335/3.2 μg kg(-1)) for AsV followed by 1.2 (69.2/56.1) for AsIII, 1.3 (6.7/5.2) for dimethylarsinic acid, and 4.0 (0.8/0.2) for monomethylarsonic acid. Thus, the large difference in arsenic concentration between rice and bran was mostly due to the difference in the AsV concentration, which account for 96 and 95 % of the difference for total arsenic species and inorganic arsenic, respectively. Therefore, the possibility of AsV contamination in rice bran and its by-products needs more study.

Therefore, accumulation of the α' subunit of β-conglycinin in rice seeds could lead to the production of new functional rice that could promote human health.

24600019,"Rice has the predilection to take up arsenic in the form of methylated arsenic (o-As) and inorganic arsenic species (i-As). Plants defend themselves using i-As efflux systems and the production of phytochelatins (PCs) to complex i-As. Our study focused on the identification and quantification of phytochelatins by HPLC-ICP-MS/ESI-MS, relating them to the several variables linked to As exposure. GSH, 11 PCs, and As-PC complexes from the roots of six rice cultivars (Italica Carolina, Dom Sofid, 9524, Kitrana 508, YRL-1, and Lemont) exposed to low and high levels of i-As were compared with total, i-As, and o-As in roots, shoots, and grains. Only Dom Sofid, Kitrana 508, and 9524 were found to produce higher levels of PCs even when exposed to low levels of As. PCs were only correlated to i-As in the roots (r=0.884, P <0.001). However, significant negative correlations to As transfer factors (TF) roots-grains (r= -0.739, P <0.05) and shoots-grains (r= -0.541, P <0.05), suggested that these peptides help in trapping i-As but not o-As in the roots, reducing grains' i-As. Italica Carolina reduced i-As in grains after high exposure, where some specific PCs had a special role in this reduction. In Lemont, exposure to elevated levels of i-As did not result in higher i-As levels in the grains and there were no significant increases in PCs or thiols. Finally, the high production of PCs in Kitrana 508 and Dom Sofid in response to high As treatment did not relate to a reduction of i-As in grains, suggesting that other mechanisms such as As-PC release and transport seems to be important in determining grain As in these cultivars.

24588385,"Cupriavidus taiwanensis KKU2500-3 is a cadmium (Cd)-tolerant bacterial strain that was previously isolated from rice fields contaminated with high levels of Cd. In 500 μmol/L CdCl2, the KKU2500-3 strain grew slower and with a more prolonged lag-phase than when grown in the absence of Cd. A proteomic approach was used to characterize the protein expression in the Cd-tolerant bacteria C. taiwanensis KKU2500-3 during growth under Cd stress. When compared with the untreated cells, a total of 982 differentially expressed protein spots were observed in the CdCl2-treated cells, and 59 and 10 spots exhibited >2- and >4-fold changes, respectively. The level of up- and downregulation varied from 2.01- to 11.26-fold and from 2.01- to 5.34-fold, respectively. Of the 33 differentially expressed protein spots analyzed by MALDI TOF MS/MS, 19 spots were successfully identified, many of which were involved in stress responses. The most highly upregulated protein (+7.95-fold) identified was the chaperone GroEL, which indicated that this factor likely contributed to the bacterial survival and growth in response to Cd toxicity. Detection of the downregulated protein flagellin (-3.52-fold) was consistent with the less effective ATP-mediated and flagella-driven motility. The flagella-losing cells were also observed in the Cd-treated bacteria when analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Thus, the Cd-stressed cells may downregulate pathways involving ATP utilization in favor of other mechanisms in response to Cd toxicity. When the KKU2500-3 strain was grown in the presence of Cd, H2S was not detected, suggesting a possible role of the sulfur in precipitation with Cd. Apart from a general response, no specific process could be determined using the present proteomic approach. However, the potential role of protein folding-mediated GroEL, flagella-mediated motility and CdS biotransformation in Cd toxicity response observed in this study as well as the extent of Cd-tolerant mechanisms using other methods could facilitate the future application of this strain in addressing Cd environmental contamination.

A relatively high content of Fe was found in cashew nuts and green lentils, while cashew nuts and buckwheat groats had the highest concentration of Zn. It was found that the highest amount of macro-elements was generally in nuts, in particular: brazil nuts (Ca and Mg), cashews (Mg) and hazelnuts (Ca and Mg).

In the present study, the amino acid enantiomers were determined by two-dimensional HPLC techniques after pre-column fluorescence derivatization with 4-fluoro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole. In the first dimension, the amino acid enantiomers are separated as their d plus l mixtures by the reversed-phase mode, then the d-amino acids and their l-counterparts are separately determined in the second dimension by the enantioselective columns. As a result, large amounts of d-Ala (800-4000nmol/mL), d-Asp (200-400nmol/mL) and d-Glu (150-500nmol/mL) were observed in some of the traditionally produced Kurozu vinegars.

This study investigates effects of accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) on anthocyanin composition and extraction efficiency from blue wheat, purple corn, and black rice in comparison with the commonly used solvent extraction (CSE). Factorial experimental design was employed to study effects of ASE and MAE variables, and anthocyanin extracts were analyzed by spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (DAD), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry chromatography. The extraction efficiency of ASE and MAE was comparable with CSE at the optimal conditions. The greatest extraction by ASE was achieved at 50 °C, 2500 psi, 10 min using 5 cycles, and 100% flush. For MAE, a combination of 70 °C, 300 W, and 10 min in MAE was the most effective in extracting anthocyanins from blue wheat and purple corn compared with 50 °C, 1200 W, and 20 min for black rice. The anthocyanin composition of grain extracts was influenced by the extraction method. The ASE extraction method seems to be more appropriate in extracting anthocyanins from the colored grains as being comparable with the CSE method based on changes in anthocyanin composition. The method caused lower structural changes in anthocaynins compared with the MAE method. Changes in blue wheat anthocyanins were lower in comparison with purple corn or black rice perhaps due to the absence of acylated anthocyanin compounds in blue wheat. The results show significant differences in anthocyanins among the 3 extraction methods, which indicate a need to standardize a method for valid comparisons among studies and for quality assurance purposes.

Analysis of RE oligosaccharides, both 2AB labelled (from W-sol Fr) and glycosyl-alditol (from KOH-sol Fr), revealed that the RE glycosyl sequence of wheat endosperm AX comprises a linear (1→4)-β-D-Xylp backbone which may be mono-substituted with either an α-L-Araf residue at the reducing end β-D-Xylp residue and/or penultimate RE β-D-Xyl residue; β-D-Xylp-(1→4)-[α-L-Araf-(1→3)](+/-)-β-D-Xylp-(1→4)-[α-L-Araf-(1→3)](+/-)-β-D-Xylp and/or an α-D-GlcpA residue at the reducing end β-D-Xylp residue; β-D-Xylp-(1→4)-[α-L-Araf-(1→3)](+/-)-β-D-Xylp-(1→4)-[α-D-GlcAp-(1→2)]-β-D-Xylp.

Microscale changes in redox conditions from rhizosphere to soil matrix affect the As speciation and Fe plaque deposition. In order to focus on the rhizosphere environment, we observed microscale distribution and speciation of As around the rhizosphere of paddy rice with X-ray fluorescence mapping and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. When the soil matrix was anaerobic during rice growth, Fe-plaque did not cover the entire root, and As(III) was the dominant arsenic species in the soil matrix and rhizosphere. Draining before harvest led the conditions to shift to aerobic. Oxidation of As(III) to As(V) occurred faster in the Fe-plaque than the soil matrix. Arsenic was scavenged by iron mottles originating from Fe-plaque around the roots. The ratio of As(V) to As(III) decreased toward the outer-rim of the subsurface Fe mottles where the soil matrix was not completely aerated. These results provide direct evidence that speciation of As near rice roots depends on spatial and temporal redox variations in the soil matrix.

This work focuses on hydride generation (HG) coupled with an ICPMS as an arsenic detector where the HG is added as a selective step to determine iAs in the gaseous phase while organically bound As remains in the solution. iAs forms volatile arsine species with high efficiency when treated with NaBH4 at acidic conditions, whereas most other organoarsenic compounds do not form any or only less volatile arsines. Additionally, using high concentrations of HCl further reduces the production of the less volatile arsines and iAs is almost exclusively formed, therefore enabling to measure iAs without a prior step of species separation using chromatography. Here, we coupled a commercially available HG system to an ICPMS and optimized for determination of iAs in rice and samples of marine origin using different acid concentrations, wet and dry plasma conditions, and different reaction gas modes. Comparing this method to conventional HPLC-ICPMS, no statistical difference in iAs concentration was found and comparable limits of detections were achieved using less than half the instrument time.

24323464,"Rice proteomics has progressed at a tremendous pace since the year 2000, and that has resulted in establishing and understanding the proteomes of tissues, organs, and organelles under both normal and abnormal (adverse) environmental conditions. Established proteomes have also helped in re-annotating the rice genome and revealing the new role of previously known proteins. The progress of rice proteomics had recognized it as the corner/stepping stone for at least cereal crops. Rice proteomics remains a model system for crops as per its exemplary proteomics research. Proteomics-based discoveries in rice are likely to be translated in improving crop plants and vice versa against ever-changing environmental factors. This review comprehensively covers rice proteomics studies from August 2010 to July 2013, with major focus on rice responses to diverse abiotic (drought, salt, oxidative, temperature, nutrient, hormone, metal ions, UV radiation, and ozone) as well as various biotic stresses, especially rice-pathogen interactions. The differentially regulated proteins in response to various abiotic stresses in different tissues have also been summarized, indicating key metabolic and regulatory pathways. We envision a significant role of rice proteomics in addressing the global ground level problem of food security, to meet the demands of the human population which is expected to reach six to nine billion by 2040.

24323250,"Microcystin-leucine and arginine (microcystin-LR) is a cyanotoxin produced by cyanobacteria like Microcystis aeruginosa, and it's considered a threat to water quality, agriculture, and human health. Rice (Oryza sativa) is a plant of great importance in human food consumption and economy, with extensive use around the world. It is therefore important to assess the possible effects of using water contaminated with microcystin-LR to irrigate rice crops, in order to ensure a safe, high quality product to consumers. In this study, 12 and 20-day-old plants were exposed during 2 or 7 days to a M. aeruginosa extract containing environmentally relevant microcystin-LR concentrations, 0.26-78 μg/L. Fresh and dry weight of roots and leaves, chlorophyll fluorescence, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and protein identification by mass spectrometry through two-dimensional gel electrophoresis from root and leaf tissues, were evaluated in order to gauge the plant's physiological condition and biochemical response after toxin exposure. Results obtained from plant biomass, chlorophyll fluorescence, and enzyme activity assays showed no significant differences between control and treatment groups. However, proteomics data indicates that plants respond to M. aeruginosa extract containing environmentally relevant microcystin-LR concentrations by changing their metabolism, responding differently to different toxin concentrations. Biological processes most affected were related to protein folding and stress response, protein biosynthesis, cell signalling and gene expression regulation, and energy and carbohydrate metabolism which may denote a toxic effect induced by M. aeruginosa extract and microcystin-LR. The implications of the metabolic alterations in plant physiology and growth require further elucidation.

A ultra high performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/TOFMS) method was developed and validated to screen for the presence of these mycotoxins in those cereal matrices. Matrix-matched calibration curves were used to compensate for ion suppression and extraction losses and the recovery values were in agreement with the minimum requirements of Regulation 401/2006/EC (70-110%). For most mycotoxins, the LODs obtained allowed detection in compliance with the maximum permitted levels set in Regulation EC/2006/1881, with the exception of OTA in all cereals and AFB1 in yellow noodles. Extra target analysis of OTA in oat flakes and wheat noodles was performed by HPLC with fluorescence detection. High rates of contamination were observed in paddy rice (23% DON, 23% FB₁, 7% AFB₁, 2% AFG₁ and 2% AFG₂), white wheat noodles (33% DON and 5% OTA) and oat flakes (17% DON, 2% OTA and 2% AFB₁), whereas the rates of contamination were lower in polished rice (2% AFG₁ and 4% HT-2 toxin) and yellow noodles (5% DON). Low rates of co-occurrence of several mycotoxins were observed only for white wheat noodles (5%) and paddy rice (7%). White noodles were contaminated with DON and/or OTA, while combinations of AFG₁, AFB₁, DON and FB₁ were found in paddy rice.

24306693,"Brachypodium distachyon, a small wild grass within the Pooideae family, is a new model organism for exploring the functional genomics of cereal crops. It was shown to have close relationships to wheat, barley and rice. Here, we describe the molecular characterisation and evolutionary relationships of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) genes from B. distachyon. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), high performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses demonstrated that there was no HMW-GS expression in the Brachypodium grains due to the silencing of their encoding genes. Through allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) amplification and cloning, a total of 13 HMW-GS encoding genes from diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid Brachypodium species were obtained, and all of them had typical structural features of y-type HMW-GS genes from common wheat and related species, particularly more similar to the 1Dy12 gene. However, the presence of an in-frame premature stop codon (TAG) at position 1521 in the coding region resulted in the conversion of all the genes to pseudogenes. Further, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that HMW-GS genes in B. distachyon displayed a similar trend, but with a low transcriptional expression profile during grain development due to the occurrence of the stop codon. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the highly conserved Glu-1-2 loci were presented in B. distachyon, which displayed close phylogenetic evolutionary relationships with Triticum and related species.

XRF observation results illustrated that in the single Cd treatments, Cd mainly distributed in the bottom of root, while equably existed in the shoot. Additionally, S addition could facilitate Cd transfer to the top of shoot and finally form the similar distribution trend for S and Cd, suggesting that S might increase the synthesis of thiol pool (such as PCs, GSH and NPT) and then chelate Cd, which further affected Cd translocation.

Quantification limits ranging from 1 to 5μgkg(-1) were obtained. Recoveries ranged from 70% to 106% for most of the 16 PAHs under analysis. The optimised methodology was applied to assess safety concerning the content of PAHs in white and parboiled rice samples, dried by gas and wood burning. Although benzo(a)pyrene, the marker used for evaluating the carcinogenic risk of PAHs in food, was not detected in the samples, naphthalene and phenanthrene were detected in all of them. Since cereals have been shown to be an important source of PAHs in the diet, methods that perform the evaluation of the quality of this food group become relevant.

Although copper and silicon generally showed cell wall localization, arsenic, iron and zinc were strongly localized in the vacuoles of specific cell types. Arsenic was highly localized in the companion cell vacuoles of the phloem in all vascular bundles, showing a strong co-localization with sulfur, consistent with As(III)-thiol complexation. Within the node, zinc was localized in the vacuoles of the parenchyma cell bridge bordering the enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles, whereas iron and manganese were localized in the fundamental parenchyma cells, with iron being strongly co-localized with phosphorus in the vacuoles. The highly heterogeneous and contrasting distribution patterns of these elements imply different transport activities and/or storage capacities among different cell types.

However, the mechanism of stress alleviation by Si at the single-cell level is poorly understood. We cultivated suspended rice (Oryza sativa) cells and protoplasts and investigated them using a combination of plant nutritional and physical techniques including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We found that most Si accumulated in the cell walls in a wall-bound organosilicon compound. Total cadmium (Cd) concentrations in protoplasts from Si-accumulating (+Si) cells were significantly reduced at moderate concentrations of Cd in the culture medium compared with those from Si-limiting (-Si) cells. In situ measurement of cellular fluxes of the cadmium ion (Cd(2+) ) in suspension cells and root cells of rice exposed to Cd(2+) and/or Si treatments showed that +Si cells significantly inhibited the net Cd(2+) influx, compared with that in -Si cells. Furthermore, a net negative charge (charge density) within the +Si cell walls could be neutralized by an increase in the Cd(2+) concentration in the measuring solution.

24101203,"Human serum albumin (HSA) is widely utilized for medical purposes and biochemical research. Transgenic rice has proved to be an attractive bioreactor for mass production of recombinant HSA (rHSA). However, transgene spread is a major environmental and food safety concern for transgenic rice expressing proteins of medical value. This study aimed to develop a selectively terminable transgenic rice line expressing HSA in rice seeds, and a simple process for recovery and purification of rHSA for economical manufacture. An HSA expression cassette was inserted into a T-DNA vector encoding an RNA interference (RNAi) cassette suppressing the CYP81A6 gene. This gene detoxifies the herbicide bentazon and is linked to the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) cassette which confers glyphosate tolerance. ANX Sepharose Fast Flow (ANX FF) anion exchange chromatography coupled with Butyl Sepharose High Performance (Butyl HP) hydrophobic interaction chromatography was used to purify rHSA. A transgenic rice line, HSA-84, was obtained with stable expression of rHSA of up to 0.72% of the total dry weight of the dehusked rice seeds. This line also demonstrated high sensitivity to bentazon, and thus could be killed selectively by a spray of bentazon. A two-step chromatography purification scheme was established to purify the rHSA from rice seeds to a purity of 99% with a recovery of 62.4%. Results from mass spectrometry and N-terminus sequencing suggested that the purified rHSA was identical to natural plasma-derived HSA. This study provides an alternative strategy for large-scale production of HSA with a built-in transgene safety control mechanism. ",Journal of Zhejiang University. Science.

Seventy-three aroma-active compounds were identified by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition to acids, esters, and alcohols, benzaldehyde, vanillin, geosmin, and γ-nonalactone were identified to be potentially important to Chinse rice wine. The concentration of these aroma-active compounds in the Chinese rice wine was further quantitated by combination of four different methods, including headsapce-gas chromatography, solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography (SPME)-GC-MS, solid-phase extraction-GC-MS, and SPME-GC-pulsed flame photometric detection (PFPD). Quantitative results showed that 34 aroma compounds were at concentrations higher than their corresponding odor thresholds. On the basis of the odor activity values (OAVs), vanillin, dimethyl trisulfide, β-phenylethyl alcohol, guaiacol, geosmin, and benzaldehyde could be responsible for the unique aroma of Chinese rice wine.

Here we combined 2-DE comparative proteomic and RNA-seq transcriptomic analyses to identify fecundity-related proteins and genes. Using high- and low-fecundity populations as sample groups, a total of 54 and 75 proteins were significantly altered in the third and sixth day brachypterous female stages, respectively, and 39 and 54 of these proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. In addition, 71,966 unigenes were quantified by Illumina sequencing. On the basis of the transcriptomic analysis, 7408 and 1639 unigenes demonstrated higher expression levels in the high-fecundity population in the second day brachypterous female adults and the second day fifth instar nymphs, respectively, and 411 unigenes were up-regulated in both groups. Of these dozens of proteins and thousands of unigenes, five were differentially expressed at both the protein and mRNA levels at all four time points, suggesting that these genes may regulate fecundity. Glutamine synthetase (GS) was chosen for further functional studies. RNAi knockdown of the GS gene reduced the fecundity of N. lugens by 64.6%, disrupted ovary development, and inhibited vitellogenin (Vg) expression.

An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) was used to determine total As. Due to the different toxicities of the chemical forms of arsenic, the ICP-MS coupled to a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) was used to perform As speciation. The total and speciated arsenic was determined in 31 different infant rice cereals sold in U.S. supermarkets. The mass fraction of total inorganic As (iAs; sum of arsenite As(III) and arsenate As(V)) concentrations ranged between 55.5 ± 1.3 and 158.0 ± 6.0 μg/kg. The average total arsenic and iAs concentrations in infant rice cereal were 174.4 and 101.4 μg/kg, respectively. There was no substantial difference in iAs levels between organic and conventional rice cereals. The mixed-grain rice cereal contained the least total (105 μg/kg) and inorganic arsenic (63 μg/kg). The major detected organoarsenical species was dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) was not detected, or only trace levels were found. Spiked sample percent recoveries for iAs, DMA, and MMA ranged from a low of 97.3% for iAs to a high of 115.0% for DMA. Results for speciated and total As in the National Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference material rice flour (NIST SRM 1568) were in good agreement with certified values. In the NIST SRM 1568 sample (n = 5) repeatability (%RSD) was 2.8% for iAs, 1.7% for DMA and species sum, and 5.3% for the total arsenic by As total method.

24016103,"Similarity among food allergens is a great problem affecting the specificity of diagnosis and treatment of allergic patients. We have observed that 80% of patients with food (including wheat) and pollen allergies have increased IgE antibodies against rice proteins. By immunoblotting, we documented that boiling decreased solubility and IgE reactivity of PBS-extracted rice and wheat proteins, yet in SDS extracts this reactivity was only slightly changed. The sera of patients highly positive on the IgE immunoblot and positive in basophil activation and skin prick test with boiled rice components were used for characterizing the IgE-binding proteins separated by 1D or 2D electrophoresis. Using mass spectrometry, we identified 22 rice SDS soluble proteins. Six of them were new thermostable potential rice allergens: glutelin C precursor, granule-bound starch synthase 1 protein, disulfide isomerase-like 1-1 protein, hypothetical protein OsI_13867, putative acid phosphatase precursor 1, and a protein encoded by locus Os02g0453600.

In the soil solution (pore water), only As(III) (arsenite), As(V) (arsenate), and DMA(V) ( dimethylarsinic acid) were detected, but no MMA(V)(mono methylarsinic acid) was found. With the increasing time of flooding and at the test temperatures, arsenite became the predominant species, averagely accounting for 64%, followed by As(V), with the proportion of 35%, and DMA(V), with the least proportion of 1%. Soil sterilization or non-sterilization had less effect on the concentrations of As(III) and DMA(V) in the soil solution, but remarkably affected the reduction of As(V) and the methylation of As(III). The promotion effect of soil sterilization decreased gradually with the increasing time of flooding and incubation. At 50 degrees C and after flooded for 23 days, the DMA(V) concentration in sterilized soil solution was the highest and up to 23.7 ng x mL(-1), indicating that some thermophilic microbes remained in sterilized soil became predominant species, and promoted the methylation of As(III) In sum, the total arsenic concentration in non-sterilized soil at incubation temperature 27 degrees C and flooded for 23 days was relatively low (501 ng x mL(-1)), and thus, in As-contaminated paddy rice planting areas, to adopt the water management mode of short cycle flooding-non-flooding could decrease the As level in soil solution as far as possible, and in the same time, save water resources and ensure yielding.",Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology,"['D001149', 'D001151', 'D018053', 'D002101', 'D003198', 'D055868', 'D012275', 'D012989', 'D012996', 'D013696']","['Arsenates', 'Arsenic', 'Arsenites', 'Cacodylic Acid', 'Computer Simulation', 'Floods', 'Oryza', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Solutions', 'Temperature']",[Variations of arsenic species in the solution of arsenic-contaminated paddy soil under flooding and at different temperatures].,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000254', 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'growth & development', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24015564,2014

The residues were analyzed with a gas chromatograph and were confirmed with mass spectrometry. About 51 % of the samples were detected with one or more residues. Thirteen out of the 19 residues were present in levels above detection limits in various concentrations. The median concentrations of the residues in all the samples tested, ranged from 0.00010 to 0.33 mg/kg. Highest median concentration was for β-HCH in water samples. Exposures to all the residues were below the respective ADIs at both mean and 95th percentile levels of food intakes with highest estimated dietary intakes (EDIs) of β-HCH in both the cases. The EDIs of β-HCH were the highest among all the residues at both the intake levels among all the SES.

In this study, we investigated anticancer activities of AC grown on germinated brown rice (CBR) in HT-29 human colon cancer cells. We found that the inhibitory efficacy of CBR 80% ethanol (EtOH) extract on HT-29 and CT-26 cell proliferation was more effective than ordinary AC EtOH 80% extract. Next, 80% EtOH extract of CBR was further separated into four fractions; hexane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), butanol (BuOH), and water. Among them, CBR EtOAc fraction showed the strongest inhibitory activity against HT-29 cell proliferation. Therefore, CBR EtOAc fraction was chosen for further studies. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining data indicated that CBR EtOAc fraction induced apoptosis. Induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest on human colon carcinoma cell was observed in CBR EtOAc fraction-treated cells. We found that CBR decreased the level of proteins involved in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. CBR EtOAc fraction inhibited the β-catenin signaling pathway, supporting its suppressive activity on the level of cyclin D1. High performance liquid chromatography analysis data indicated that CBR EtOAc fraction contained adenosine.

Manual gas sampling followed by gas chromatography (GC) is widely used for measuring GHG fluxes in agricultural fields, but is laborious and time-consuming. The photo-acoustic infrared gas monitoring system (PAS) with on-line gas sampling is an attractive option, although it has not been evaluated for measuring GHG fluxes in cereals in general and rice in particular. We compared N2 O, CO2 , and CH4 fluxes measured by GC and PAS from agricultural fields under the rice-wheat and maize-wheat systems during the wheat (winter), and maize/rice (monsoon) seasons in Haryana, India. All the PAS readings were corrected for baseline drifts over time and PAS-CH4 (PCH4 ) readings in flooded rice were corrected for water vapor interferences. The PCH4 readings in ambient air increased by 2.3 ppm for every 1000 mg cm(-3) increase in water vapor. The daily CO2 , N2 O, and CH4 fluxes measured by GC and PAS from the same chamber were not different in 93-98% of all the measurements made but the PAS exhibited greater precision for estimates of CO2 and N2 O fluxes in wheat and maize, and lower precision for CH4 flux in rice, than GC. The seasonal GC- and PAS-N2 O (PN2 O) fluxes in wheat and maize were not different but the PAS-CO2 (PCO2 ) flux in wheat was 14-39% higher than that of GC. In flooded rice, the seasonal PCH4 and PN2 O fluxes across N levels were higher than those of GC-CH4 and GC-N2 O fluxes by about 2- and 4fold, respectively. The PAS (i) proved to be a suitable alternative to GC for N2 O and CO2 flux measurements in wheat, and (ii) showed potential for obtaining accurate measurements of CH4 fluxes in flooded rice after making correction for changes in humidity.

The limits of quantification (LOQ) of As(III), As(V), MMA, and DMA that were calculated based on sample mass were 1.6, 2.0, 2.0, and 1.6 μg kg(-1), respectively. A total of 185 rice samples (various types of rice) collected from different four regions in Thailand and some other Asian countries were analyzed. The total As and inorganic As in rice samples were in the ranges of 22.51-375.39 and 13.89-232.62 μg kg(-1), respectively. The estimated weekly intake of inorganic As from rice by Thai people accounted for 13.91-29.22% of the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI).

A simple, rapid, and effective HPLC-DAD method was developed to detect honey adulteration by rice syrup, using a characteristic compound from rice syrup, which is presently difficult to detect by current analytical methods. The characteristic compound was identified as 2-acetylfuran-3-glucopyranoside (AFGP) by MS and NMR. Based on HPLC analyses, the average concentration of AFGP was 92 ± 60 mg/kg in rice syrup. However, AFGP was not detected in any of the natural honey samples, so it could be used as a marker for the detection of honey adulteration by rice syrup. The developed method enabled a rapid detection of honey samples adulterated with 10% rice syrup. Using the developed method, 16 out of 186 honey samples from some markets were found to be adulterated with rice syrup.

23837460,"Following the earlier detection of six new esterified fumonisin B₁ (EFB₁) isomers containing three acyl groups in a Fusarium verticillioides-inoculated rice culture, it was assumed that linoleic, palmitic or oleic acid esterifies one of the free OH groups on the fumonisin backbone. On the basis of the results of our recent investigations we now propose that these EFB₁ isomers are actually 3-O- and 5-O-acyl derivatives of FB₁ (3-O-linoleoyl-FB₁, 5-O-linoleoyl-FB₁, 3-O-palmitoyl-FB₁, 5-O-palmitoyl-FB₁, 3-O-oleoyl-FB₁ and 5-O-oleoyl-FB₁). A F. verticillioides strain was identified that produced not only O-acyl-FB₁ isomers, but also low amounts of three N-acyl derivatives (N-linoleoyl-FB₁, N-palmitoyl-FB₁ and N-oleoyl-FB₁), which eluted from the HPLC column after the six O-acyl compounds and in the same sequence as for the O-acyl compounds. The characteristic positive and negative ESI-MS/MS spectra obtained after solid-phase extraction of the culture extract facilitated identification of these N-acyl-FB₁ derivatives. The biosynthesis of N-palmitoyl-FB₁ by F. verticillioides was verified by spiking the culture extract with synthetic N-palmitoyl-FB₁. This is the first report of the separation and mass spectrometric identification of the six O-acyl- and three N-acyl-FB₁ derivatives extracted from a F. verticillioides culture.","Food additives & contaminants.

23825150,"The simultaneous sorption behavior and characteristics of cadmium (Cd) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) on rice straw biochar were investigated. Isotherms of Cd and SMX were well modeled by the Langmuir equation (R(2)>0.95). The calculated maximum adsorption parameter (Q) of Cd was similar in single and binary systems (34129.69 and 35919.54 mg/kg, respectively). However, the Q of SMX in a binary system (9182.74 mg/kg) was much higher than that in a single system (1827.82 mg/kg). The presence of Cd significantly promoted the sorption of SMX on rice straw biochar. When the pH ranged from 3 to 7.5, the sorption of Cd had the characteristics of a parabola pattern with maximum adsorption at pH 5, while the adsorption quantity of SMX decreased with increasing pH, with maximum adsorption at pH 3. The amount of SMX adsorbed on biochar was positively correlated with the surface area of the biochar, and the maximum adsorption occurred with d 250 biochar (biochar with a diameter of 150-250 μm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed that the removal of Cd and SMX by rice straw biochar may be attributed to precipitation and the formation of surface complexes between Cd or SMX and carboxyl or hydroxyl groups.

The strategy was performed based on the competitive immunoreactions between antibody-colloidal gold nanoparticle conjugate probes and mycotoxins or mycotixin antigens. Each monoclonal antibody specially recognize its corresponding mycotoxin and antigen, and there was no cross reactivity in the assay. Three mycotixin antigens were immobilized as three test lines in the nitrocellulose membrane reaction zone, which enable the simultaneous detection in one single test.

23790232,"Ooids are one of the common constituents of ancient carbonate rocks, yet the role that microbial communities may or may not play in their formation remains unresolved. To search for evidence of microbial activity in modern and Holocene ooids, samples collected from intertidal waters, beaches and outcrops in the Bahamas and in Shark Bay in Western Australia were examined for their contents of lipid biomarkers. Modern samples from Cat and Andros islands in the Bahamas and from Carbla Beach in Hamelin Pool, Western Australia, showed abundant and notably similar distributions of hydrocarbons, fatty acids (FAs) and alcohols. A large fraction of these lipids were bound into the carbonate matrix and only released on acid dissolution, which suggests that these lipids were being incorporated continuously during ooid growth. The distributions of hydrocarbons, and their disparate carbon isotopic signatures, were consistent with mixed input from cyanobacteria together with small and variable amounts of vascular plant leaf wax [C27 -C35 ; δ(13) C -25 to -32‰Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB)]. The FAs comprised a complex mixture of C12 -C18 normal and branched short-chain compounds with the predominant straight-chain components attributable to bacteria and/or cyanobacteria. Branched FA, especially 10-MeC16 and 10-MeC17 , together with the prevalence of elemental sulfur in the extracts, indicate an origin from sulfate-reducing bacteria. The iso- and anteiso-FA were quite variable in their (13) C contents suggesting that they come from organisms with diverse physiologies. Hydrogen isotopic compositions provide further insight into this issue. FAs in each sample show disparate δD values consistent with inputs from autotrophs and heterotrophs. The most enigmatic lipid assemblage is an homologous series of long-chain (C24 -C32 ) FA with pronounced even carbon number preference. Typically, such long-chain FA are thought to come from land plant leaf wax, but in this case, their (13) C-enriched isotopic signatures compared to co-occurring n-alkanes (e.g., Hamelin Pool TLE FA C24 -C32 ; δ(13) C -20 to -24.2‰ VPDB; TLE n-alkanes δ(13) C -24.1 to -26.2 -‰VPDB) indicate a microbial origin, possibly sulfate-reducing bacteria. Lastly, we identified homohopanoic acid and bishomohopanol as the primary degradation products of bacterial hopanoids. The distributions of lipids isolated from Holocene oolites from the Rice Bay Formation of Cat Island, Bahamas were very similar to the beach ooids described above and, in total, these modern and fossil biomarker data lead us to hypothesize that ooids are colonized by a defined microbial community and that these microbes possibly mediate calcification.

Rice (Oryza sativa ""Nipponbare""), as a main cereal crop, can accumulate arsenic more than 10-fold that of in other cereals. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the response of rice subjected to 100 µM arsenate stress, a comparative proteomic analysis of rice shoots in combination with morphological and biochemical investigations have been performed in this study. The results demonstrated that arsenate suppressed the growth of rice seedlings, destroyed the cellular ultra-structure and changed the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, a total of 38 differentially displayed proteins, which were mainly involved in metabolism, redox and protein-metabolism, were identified. The data suggest the arsenic can inhibit rice growth through negatively affecting chloroplast structure and photosynthesis. In addition, upregulation of the proteins involved in redox and protein metabolism might help the rice to be resistant or tolerant to arsenic toxicity.

A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of four water management regimes (aerobic, intermittent irrigation, conventional irrigation and flooding) on As and Cd accumulation in seven major rice cultivars grown in Zhejiang province, east China. With increasing irrigation from aerobic to flooded conditions, the soil HCl-extractable As concentrations increased significantly and the HCl-extractable Cd concentrations decreased significantly. These trends were consistent with the As and Cd concentrations in the straw, husk and brown rice. Water management both before and after the full tillering stage affected As and Cd accumulation in the grains. The intermittent and conventional treatments produced higher grain yields than the aerobic and flooded treatments. Cd concentrations in brown rice varied 13.1-40.8 times and As varied 1.75-8.80 times among the four water management regimes. Cd and As accumulation in brown rice varied among the rice cultivars, with Guodao 6 (GD6) was a low Cd but high-As-accumulating cultivar while Indonesia (IR) and Yongyou 9 (YY9) were low As but high-Cd-accumulating cultivars. Brown rice Cd and As concentrations in the 7 cultivars were significantly negatively correlated. The results indicate that As and Cd accumulated in rice grains with opposite trends that were influenced by both water management and rice cultivar. Production of 'safe' rice with respect to As and Cd might be possible by balancing water management and rice cultivar according to the severity of soil pollution.

Most of the IACs reported either use harsh elution conditions and are used only once or use gentle elution conditions and are reused many times. Here, through the combined use of a strong-affinity antibody and packing material with good stability, high recoveries during clean-up and yet simultaneously good stability of the IAC were successfully achieved. Under optimised conditions of 80% methanol (pH 3), the IACs were used to clean-up the extracts of Monascus colour and red yeast rice samples, followed by HPLC detection.

23697136,"Adopting atomic absorption spectrometry (novAA400), the present study investigated the distribution characteristics of soil cadmium (Cd) in different textured paddy soil profiles under rice-wheat rotation and its correlation with Cd uptake by rice and wheat in Chengdu Plain through repeatedly taking soil and plant samples at the fixed sites in the field. The results revealed that Cd in the paddy soil profiles was mainly concentrated at the plough layer (0-15 cm) that obviously featured 'Cd accumulates towards the rooting layer'. Soil total Cd and available Cd (1 mol x L(-1) MgCl2 extraction) in the profile declined with soil depths and its average values at 30-45 cm only accounted for 47.60% and 39.49% of those at 0-15 cm. The potential downward movement of Cd in the different textured soil profiles was observed as sandy loam > heavy loam > loam. There was no significant correlation between soil pH and available Cd(r = - 0.46) at 0-15 cm soil depth, while significantly negative correlations between soil pH and available Cd were observed at 15-30 cm (r = -0.78) and 30-45 cm (r = -0.86). The results further demonstrated that the Cd contents in either grain or straw of rice and wheat were not well correlated with soil total Cd at any soil depth (r = -0.092-0.383 for rice and r = 0.174-0.424 for wheat), but significantly correlated with soil available Cd at 0-15 cm and at 15-30 cm (r = 0.766*-0.953**) despite insignificant correlation at 30-45 cm (r = 0.526-0.584).

23675783,"Rice, the staple food of south and east Asian counties, is considered to be hypoallergenic. However, several clinical studies have documented rice-induced allergy in sensitive patients. Rice proteins with molecular weights of 14-16, 26, 33, and 56 kDa have been identified as allergens. Recently, it was documented that the 56 kDa rice allergen was responsible for rice-induced anaphylaxis. The 14-16 kDa allergens have been identified as α-amylase inhibitors; the 26 kDa protein has been identified as α-globulin; and the 33 kDa protein has been identified as glyoxalase I. However, the identity of the 56 kDa rice allergen has not yet been determined. In this study, we demonstrate that serum from patients allergic to maize shows IgE binding to a 56 kDa protein that was present in both maize and rice but not in the oil seeds soybean and peanut. The 56 kDa IgE-binding protein was abundant in the rice endosperm. We have purified this protein from rice endosperm and demonstrated its reactivity to IgE antibodies from the serum of maize-allergic patients. The purified protein was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, resulting in identification of this rice allergen as granule-bound starch synthase, a product of the Waxy gene. Immunoblot analysis using protein extracts from a waxy mutant of rice revealed the absence of the 56 kDa IgE-binding protein. Our results demonstrate that the 56 kDa rice allergen is granule-bound starch synthase and raise the possibility of using waxy mutants of rice as a potential source of the hypoallergenic diet for patients sensitized to the 56 kDa rice allergen.

This method, however, has not been comprehensively validated by comparing these speciation results with XANES, which does not require sample extraction, due to the challenge of conducting XANES analysis at very low As concentrations. In this study As speciation data using nitric acid extraction/HPLC-ICPMS and XANES are compared to verify the efficacy of using 2% v/v nitric acid extraction and HPLC-ICPMS to measure inorganic As, DMA, and MA in reference rice materials and common rice varieties obtainable in Australia. Total As and As species (As(III), As(V), DMA, and MA) concentrations measured in 8 reference materials were in agreement with published values. XANES analysis was performed on 5 samples having total As concentrations ranging from 0.198 to 0.335 μg g(-1). XANES results gave similar proportions of total As(III), As(V), and DMA to HPLC-ICPMS. XANES was able to distinguish two forms of As(III): As(III) and As(III)GSH. Total As concentrations in rice samples varied from 0.006 to 0.45 μg g(-1) As (n = 47) with a mean ± std of 0.127 ± 0.112 μg g(-1) As with most As present as inorganic species (63 ± 26%).

23604416,"The present paper describes the development, validation and application of a method for inorganic arsenic (iAs) determination in rice samples. The separation of iAs from organoarsenic compounds was done by off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HG-AAS) detection. This approach was earlier developed for seafood samples (Rasmussen et al., Anal Bioanal Chem 403:2825-2834, 2012) and has in the present work been tailored for rice products and further optimised for a higher sample throughput and a lower detection limit. Water bath heating (90 °C, 60 min) of samples with dilute HNO3 and H2O2 solubilised and oxidised all iAs to arsenate (As(V)). Loading of buffered sample extracts (pH 6 ± 1) followed by selective elution of arsenate from a strong anion exchange SPE cartridge enabled the selective iAs quantification by HG-AAS, measuring total arsenic (As) in the SPE eluate. The in-house validation gave mean recoveries of 101-106% for spiked rice samples and in two reference samples. The limit of detection was 0.02 mg kg(-1), and repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility were less than 6 and 9%, respectively. The SPE HG-AAS method produced similar results compared to parallel high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. The SPE separation step was tested collaboratively, where the laboratories (N = 10) used either HG-AAS or ICP-MS for iAs determination in a wholemeal rice powder. The trial gave satisfactory results (HorRat value of 1.6) and did not reveal significant difference (t test, p > 0.05) between HG-AAS and ICP-MS quantification.

The concentrations of 13 elements (calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), boron (B), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), and cadmium (Cd)) were determined in the rice samples by inductively coupled plasma optical emission and mass spectrometry. Most of the essential elements for human health in rice were within normal ranges except for Mo and Se. Mo concentrations were twice as high as those in rice from Vietnam and Spain. Meanwhile, Se concentrations were three times lower in the whole province compared to the Chinese average level of 0.088 mg/kg. About 12% of the rice samples failed the Chinese national food safety standard of 0.2 mg/kg for Cd. Combined with the multi-elemental profile in rice, the principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant function analysis (DFA) and Fibonacci index analysis (FIA) were applied to discriminate geographical origins of the samples. Results indicated that the FIA method could achieve a more effective geographical origin classification compared with PCA and DFA, due to its efficiency in making the grouping even when the elemental variability was so high that PCA and DFA showed little discriminatory power. Furthermore, some elements were identified as the most powerful indicators of geographical origin: Ca, Ni, Fe and Cd.

23582855,"A novel alumina nanowire (ANW) solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber coating was prepared by a simple and rapid anodization-chemical etching method for ultra-selective determination of volatile esters and alcohols from complicated food samples. Preparation conditions for ANW SPME fiber coating including corrosion solution concentration and corrosion time were optimized in detail for better surface morphology and higher surface area based on scanning electron microscope (SEM). Under the optimum conditions, homogeneous alumina nanowire structure of ANW SPME fiber coating was achieved with the average thickness of 20 μm around. Compared with most of commercial SPME fiber coatings, ANW SPME fiber coatings achieved the higher extraction capacity and special selectivity for volatile esters and alcohols. Finally, an efficient gas sampling technique based on ANW SPME fiber coating as the core was established and successfully applied for the ultra-selective determination of trace volatile esters and alcohols from complicated banana and fermented glutinous rice samples coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) detection. It was interesting that 25 esters and 2 alcohols among 30 banana volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified and 4 esters and 7 alcohols among 13 identified VOCs of fermented glutinous rice were selectively sampled by ANW SPME fiber coatings. Furthermore, new analytical methods for the determination of some typical volatile esters and alcohols from banana and fermented glutinous rice samples at specific storage or brewing phases were developed and validated. Good recoveries for banana and fermented glutinous rice samples were achieved in range of 108-115% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.6-6.7% and 80.0-91.8% with RSDs of 0.3-1.3% (n=3), respectively.

In wheat, two dominant genes lead to non-glaucous phenotypes: Inhibitor of wax 1 (Iw1) and Iw2. The molecular mechanisms and the exact extent (beyond visual assessment) by which these genes affect the composition and quantity of cuticular wax is unclear. To describe the Iw1 locus we used a genetic approach with detailed biochemical characterization of wax compounds. Using synteny and a large number of F2 gametes, Iw1 was fine-mapped to a sub-cM genetic interval on wheat chromosome arm 2BS, which includes a single collinear gene from the corresponding Brachypodium and rice physical maps. The major components of flag leaf and peduncle cuticular waxes included primary alcohols, β-diketones and n-alkanes. Small amounts of C19-C27 alkyl and methylalkylresorcinols that have not previously been described in wheat waxes were identified. Using six pairs of BC2 F3 near-isogenic lines, we show that Iw1 inhibits the formation of β- and hydroxy-β-diketones in the peduncle and flag leaf blade cuticles. This inhibitory effect is independent of genetic background or tissue, and is accompanied by minor but consistent increases in n-alkanes and C24 primary alcohols.

The generated Cd vapor was subsequently measured by atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Dissolved Cd species were readily converted into volatile species by reaction with hydrogen in a coaxial thin-film dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor. Both atomic and molecular Cd species were produced when a solution containing Cd(2+) was exposed to hydrogen-containing DBD plasma. Fast and efficient vapor generation of Cd was achieved simply in plain (neutral) water medium. Optimal conditions for the DBD-plasma Cd vapor generator were identified. The performance of this thin-film DBD plasma-chemical vapor generation (CVG) was evaluated through comparison with that arising from the conventional HCl-KBH4 system. The vapor generation efficiency of the proposed method (He-DBD) was found to be superior to the conventional CVG approach. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limits of Cd were found to be from 0.03 ng mL(-1) (Ar-DBD) to 0.008 ng mL(-1) (He-DBD) with a heated quartz tube atomizer (QTA); good repeatability (relative standard deviation (RSD) = 1.4%, n = 5) was obtained for a 1 ng mL(-1) standard.

With thermal decomposition/evaporation temperature of <350°C, ammonium salts resulted in negligible ion source residual under typical electrospray conditions, leading to consistent method performance and less instrument cleaning. Although all ammonium salts tested induced acetonitrile/water phase separation, NH4Cl yielded the best performance, thus it was the preferred salting out agent. The NH4Cl salting out method was successfully coupled with FI/MS/MS and tested for fourteen pesticide active ingredients: chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, chlorimuron ethyl, oxamyl, methomyl, sulfometuron methyl, chlorsulfuron, triflusulfuron methyl, azimsulfuron, flupyrsulfuron methyl, aminocyclopyrachlor, aminocyclopyrachlor methyl, diuron and hexazinone. A validation study was conducted with nine complex matrices: sorghum, rice, grapefruit, canola, milk, eggs, beef, urine and blood plasma. The method is applicable to all analytes, except aminocyclopyrachlor. The method was deemed appropriate for quantitative analysis in 114 out of 126 analyte/matrix cases tested (applicability rate=0.90). The NH4Cl salting out extraction/cleanup allowed expansion of FI/MS/MS for analysis in food of plant and animal origin, and body fluids with increased ruggedness and sensitivity, while maintaining high-throughput (run time=30s/sample). Limits of quantitation (LOQs) of 0.01mgkg(-1) (ppm), the 'well-accepted standard' in pesticide residue analysis, were achieved in >80% of cases tested; while limits of detection (LODs) were typically in the range of 0.001-0.01mgkg(-1) (ppm). A comparison to a well-established HPLC/MS/MS method was also conducted, yielding comparable results, thus confirming the suitability of NH4Cl salting out FI/MS/MS for pesticide residue analysis.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D000643', 'D000818', 'D001826', 'D005504', 'D006540', 'D007306', 'D010573', 'D051381', 'D053719', 'D013696']","['Ammonium Chloride', 'Animals', 'Body Fluids', 'Food Analysis', 'Herbicides', 'Insecticides', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Rats', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Temperature']",Ammonium chloride salting out extraction/cleanup for trace-level quantitative analysis in food and biological matrices by flow injection tandem mass spectrometry.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23473245,2013

The glucuronoarabinoxylan of grass cell walls is esterified with the phenylpropanoid-derived hydroxycinnamic acids ferulic acid (FA) and para-coumaric acid (p-CA). Feruloyl esters undergo oxidative coupling with neighboring phenylpropanoids on glucuronoarabinoxylan and lignin. Examination of rice (Oryza sativa) mutants in a grass-expanded and -diverged clade of BAHD acyl-coenzyme A-utilizing transferases identified four mutants with altered cell wall FA or p-CA contents. Here, we report on the effects of overexpressing one of these genes, OsAt10 (LOC_Os06g39390), in rice. An activation-tagged line, OsAT10-D1, shows a 60% reduction in matrix polysaccharide-bound FA and an approximately 300% increase in p-CA in young leaf tissue but no discernible phenotypic alterations in vegetative development, lignin content, or lignin composition. Two additional independent OsAt10 overexpression lines show similar changes in FA and p-CA content. Cell wall fractionation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments isolate the cell wall alterations in the mutant to ester conjugates of a five-carbon sugar with p-CA and FA. These results suggest that OsAT10 is a p-coumaroyl coenzyme A transferase involved in glucuronoarabinoxylan modification.

In the present study, a rice (Oryza sativa) gene encoding type 1 MT isoform, OsMTI-1b, was inserted in vector pET41a and overexpressed in Escherichia coli as carboxy-terminal extensions of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The recombinant protein GST-OsMTI-1b was purified using affinity chromatography and its ability to bind with Ni(2+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) ions was analyzed. The results demonstrated that this isoform has ability to bind Ni(2+), Cd(2+) and Zn(2+) ions in vitro, whereas it has no substantial ability to bind Cu(2+) ions. From competitive reaction with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), DTNB, the affinity of metal ions for recombinant form of GST-OsMTI-1b was as follows: Ni(2+)/Cd(2+) > Zn(2+) > Cu(2+).",The protein journal,"['D002104', 'D003300', 'D004926', 'D015870', 'D008668', 'D008670', 'D009532', 'D012275', 'D010940', 'D011485', 'D011994', 'D015032']","['Cadmium', 'Copper', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression', 'Metallothionein', 'Metals', 'Nickel', 'Oryza', 'Plant Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Zinc']",Heterologous expression and metal-binding characterization of a type 1 metallothionein isoform (OsMTI-1b) from rice (Oryza sativa).,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378']","['metabolism', 'metabolism', 'genetics', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23385446,2013

The DSQAP invites laboratories twice annually to participate in interlaboratory studies where participants elect to measure concentrations of nutritional and/or toxic elements as well as active and/or marker compounds. One of these studies was designed to determine the effects of material granularity and sample processing techniques on measurement variability (precision) as well as to provide participating laboratories information on their performance relative to the NIST assigned values (bias) and to the other participants (concordance). Participants were asked to determine the mass fractions of Ca, Fe, and Zn, in mg/kg, in six breakfast cereal samples. Cereal samples consisted of three ground materials (homogenized wheat, wheat, and rice), two flake materials (wheat and rice) and a partially crushed material (a wheat/rice mixture). In general, approximately 25% of the laboratories processed and analyzed the suite of six cereal materials with adequate to exemplary measurement precision. Over half of the laboratories (60%) experienced measurement issues related to only a particular type of cereal matrix or for only a single element. A small number (15%) of laboratories experienced significant sample processing or measurement problems.

23363238,"To study the sources and transformations of Hg in the rice plant ( Oryza sativa L.), stable Hg isotope variations in different tissues (foliage, root, stem, and seed) of rice which were collected from the Wanshan mercury mine (WSMM, Guizhou province, SW China) were investigated by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). In comparison, Hg isotope compositions of paddy soil, lichen, and direct ambient air samples in WSMM were also analyzed. We observed that mass dependent fractionation (MDF) of Hg differed by up to ∼ 3.0‰ in δ(202)Hg values and that mass independent fractionation (MIF) of Hg isotopes affected the odd Hg isotopes to produce a ∼ 0.40‰ range in Δ(199)Hg (and Δ(201)Hg) values in tissues of rice plant. The 1:1 Δ(199)Hg/Δ(201)Hg ratio in tissues of rice supported the hypothesis that a fraction of Hg in tissues of rice plants has undergone a photoreduction process prior to being accumulated by rice plants. We suggest that the variation of MIF represents a mixing between soil Hg and atmospheric Hg in rice plants. The estimated fraction of atmospheric Hg (f) in tissues of rice followed the trend of f leaf > f stem > f seed > f root. Finally, we demonstrated a significant MDF of >1.0‰ in δ(202)Hg during the processes of absorption of atmospheric Hg by leaf tissues and of absorption of soil Hg by roots.

23339461,"The presence of specific volatile and aminothiols in wine is associated with quality, worth, price, and taste. The identification of specific thiol-containing compounds in various wines has been reported in many valuable and interesting works. In this study, a novel foodomics assay of thiol-containing compounds, such as free aminothiols and related conjugates, was developed using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with fluorescence (FL) and electrospray (ESI) time-of-flight mass spectrometric (TOF/MS) detections. FL specific derivatization was applied along with multivariate statistical analysis. First, the optimal experimental conditions were studied using representative thiols, such as l-cysteine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, cysteamine, and l-glutathione, and then the UPLC-FL derivatization and separation steps were fixed for the subsequent screening of unknown thiol-containing compounds. The screening assay consisted of monitoring the UPLC-TOF/MS peaks of unknown thiols, which decreased due to the derivatization as compared to the nonderivatized thiols. The principal component analysis of the UPLC-TOF/MS data could be well-differentiated and categorized into two groups. The orthogonal signal correction partial least-squares discriminant analysis, the so-called S-plot, showed that the quality differentiation is directly related to the decrease of native thiols and increase of derivatized thiols. With this strategy, the mass difference from the derivatization reagent (+m/z 198) could be utilized for the identification of these thiols using the FL peaks retention time and metabolomics-databases. The presence of l-glutathione in rice wine was for the first time reported on the basis of the available metabolomics-databases and standard matching.

In this work we identified five sequences of putative secreted sPLA₂ from soybean after a BLAST search in G. max database. Sequence analysis showed a conserved PA2c domain bearing the Ca²⁺ binding loop and the active site motif. All the five mature proteins contain 12 cysteine residues, which are commonly conserved in plant sPLA₂s. We propose a phylogenetic tree based on sequence alignment of reported plant sPLA₂s including the novel enzymes from G. max. According to PLA₂ superfamily, two of G. max sPLA₂s are grouped as XIA and the rest of sequences as XIB, on the basis of differences found in their molecular weights and deviating sequences especially in the N- and C-terminal regions of the isoenzymes. Furthermore, we report the cloning, expression and purification of one of the putative isoenzyme denoted as GmsPLA₂-XIA-1. We demonstrate that this mature sPLA₂ of 114 residues had PLA₂ activity on Triton:phospholipid mixed micelles and determine the kinetic parameters for this system. We generate a model based on the known crystal structure of sPLA₂ from rice (isoform II), giving first insights into the three-dimensional structure of folded GmsPLA₂-XIA-1.

To better analyze DON in rice and corn silages using a commercially available ELISA kit, a cleanup method using a MultiSep #226 column was developed. As a result, overestimation of DON by the influence of specific cross-reaction with acetyldeoxynivalenol (AcDON) was confirmed. In samples where AcDON was not detected by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), no samples showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in DON amounts between ELISA with cleanup and LC-MS analysis. For the recovery study, blank silage was spiked with 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg DON. The mean recoveries of DON determined by ELISA with cleanup and LC-MS analysis were 112 and 96%, respectively, and the relative standard deviation for the repeatability (RSDr) were 8.2 and 9.8%, respectively. No samples showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in DON concentration determined by either ELISA or LC-MS analysis. A collaborative study to validate this rapid method was carried out using four samples, two rice and two corn silage, by 10 participating laboratories.

Although levels up to 173 μg/kg were already reported for commercial canned/jarred foods, it seems that the cooking in a pressure cooker may not represent a concern in relation to the occurrence of furan in foods.

Citrinin is a toxic fermentation by-product which can be found as a contaminant. An accurate, simple and rapid micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatographic method was developed for the first time for simultaneous determination of lovastatin present in lactone and hydroxy acid forms and citrinin in red rice products provided by different manufacturers and formulated in various dosage forms. Separation was achieved within only 2 min using 20 mM of phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 30 mM of sodium dodecyl sulphate at an applied voltage of 25 kV. Sensitivity crucial for detecting citrinin was enhanced by using an extended light path capillary.

Imidacloprid was not detected in samples of fruit juices and baby foods. It was, however, detected in 38 samples of fruits, vegetables, and cereals, which is about 15.20% of the total samples. Of samples of fruits, 22% showed the presence of imidacloprid, and 2% of samples showed residues above the maximal residue limit. Although imidacloprid was detected in 24% of vegetable samples, only 5.71% showed the presence of imidacloprid above the maximal residue limit. However, 33% of cereal samples showed the presence of imidacloprid, and about 3% of samples were above the maximal residue limit. The calculated estimated daily intake ranged between 0.004 and 0.131 µg/kg body weight, and the hazard indices ranged from 0.007 to 0.218 for these food commodities.

After pre-separation by gel column chromatography, the gamma-amylase in honey samples was separated from the sugars. The gamma-amylase was then used to catalyze maltose into glucose. This enzymatic reaction was under the conditions of 55 degrees C and 0.03 mol/L phosphate buffer solution (pH 4.5) for 48 h. The maltose and glucose in the above enzymatic reaction solution were separated using liquid chromatography. By measuring the content of glucose with isotope ratio mass spectrometry, the gamma-amylase in honey can be determined. The linear range of gamma-amylase was 5 - 200 U/kg with the quantification limit of 5 U/kg. The recoveries were between 89.6% and 108.2% with the relative standard deviations from 3.3% to 4.9%. This method was used to analyze 38 honey and rice syrup samples, and the detection rate of gamma-amylase was 76.3%. To further verify the detection capability of this method, an authentic honey was adulterated with 15% (mass fraction) rice syrup. The gamma-amylase content in this sample was 10.2 U/kg.

23182936,"Gas and liquid chromatography (GC and LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) serve as the most powerful analytical tools commonly used to monitor pesticide residues in food, among other applications. However, both GC-MS and LC-MS are susceptible to matrix effects which can adversely affect quantification depending on the analyte, matrix, sample preparation, instrumentation, and operating conditions. Among the approaches that reduce matrix effects, the most common in pesticide residue applications is matrix-matched calibration because it is relatively inexpensive and simple. Also, it has been shown to work well during method validation when fortified samples are exactly matched with samples used for calibration. However, the quality of matrix-matched results in real-world analyses depends on the consistency of matrix effects among diverse samples. In this study, the variability of matrix effects was measured for 38 representative pesticides in 20 samples each (including different varieties) of rice, orange, apple, and spinach extracted using the ""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe"" (QuEChERS) method for analysis by LC-MS/MS and low-pressure GC-MS. Using LC-MS/MS, only oranges gave >20% matrix effects for a few pesticides. GC-MS exhibited larger matrix effects, but as in LC-MS/MS, the differences were reasonably consistent among the 20 samples tested. Main conclusions of this study are that for the conditions utilized: (1) matrix-matching was not needed for most pesticides in the simpler food matrices; and (2) for the more complex orange matrix, acceptably accurate quantitative results were achieved by using matrix-matching even with a different sample of the same type.

Monitoring these compounds is necessary to know the impact of phytosanitary products in the different environmental compartments. In this work, surface water and soil samples from different sites of this area have been analyzed by applying an analytical methodology for large screening based on the use of time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) hyphenated to liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC). Several pesticides were detected and unequivocally identified, such as the herbicides atrazine, diuron or clomazone.

According to (1)H and (13)C-NMR spectroscopy, one genotoxic impact compound was identified as Altertoxin II (ATXII). ATXII showed potent DNA damaging properties in HT29 cells with substantial induction of formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG)-sensitive sites. However, no effect was observed with respect to the cellular redox status, measured in the DCF assay and as total glutathione. The induction of apoptosis could be excluded as a potential reason for enhanced DNA damage.

The Ikarashi soil showed the slowest decrease in DPAA concentrations among the four soils, but the transformation of DPAA was notably enhanced by addition of exogenous sulfate together with acetate, cellulose or rice straw. Addition of molybdate, a specific inhibitor of sulfate reduction, resulted in the stagnation of DPAA transformation, suggesting that indigenous sulfate reducers play a role in DPAA transformation under anaerobic conditions.

23066826,"Supercritical fluid extrusion (SCFX) was used to produce shelf-stable puffed rice fortified with protein, dietary fiber, and micronutrients. Product ingredients and process parameters were evaluated for end-product nutritional and textural qualities. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO(2)) served as a viscosity-lowering plasticizer and blowing agent during the process, which has been shown to produce expanded products with good textural qualities at lower temperatures (~100 °C) than conventional steam-based extrusion (130-180 °C). The fortified puffed rice contained 8% dietary fiber, 21.5% protein, and iron, zinc, and vitamins A and C at their recommended daily values in 100 g of product. The SCFX process allowed for the complete retention of all added minerals, 55-58% retention of vitamin A, and 64-76% retention of vitamin C. All essential amino acids including lysine were retained at exceptionally high levels (98.6%), and no losses were observed due to Maillard reaction or oxidation. All of the essential amino acid contents were equal to the reference protein recommended by FAO/WHO. Soy protein fortification improved the total amount of protein in the final rice products and provided a complementary amino acid profile to that of rice; the lysine content improved from 35 to 60 mg/protein, making the end product an excellent source of complete protein. Thus, SC-CO(2)-assisted extrusion is an effective process-based approach to produce cereal grain-based, low-moisture (5-8%) expanded products fortified with protein and any cocktail of micronutrients, without compromising the end-product sensory or nutritional qualities.

The five pyrazole fungicides (bixafen, fluxapyroxad, furametpyr, pyraclostrobin, and rabenzazole) were extracted from seven matrices using acetonitrile and subsequently cleaned up by octadecylsilane (C(18)) or graphitized carbon black (GCB) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The determination of the target compounds was achieved in less than 3.0min using an electrospray ionization source in positive mode (ESI+) for furametpyr, pyraclostrobin, and rabenzazole, while negative mode (ESI-) for bixafen and fluxapyroxad. The method showed excellent linearity (at least R(2)≥ 0.990) for all studied analytes.

In this study, single chain variable fragments (scFvs), which could specifically recognize and detect Cry1C in food samples, were isolated from naive phage displayed human antibody libraries (Tomlinson I + J) by iterative affinity selection procedure instead of immunization process. With increasing selection pressure, after four rounds of panning, three individual scFvs were obtained and sequenced. The antibodies were characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Thereafter, a conformed novel anti-Cry1C scFv, namely scFv-H6, was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) HB2151 and purified by Ni metal ion affinity chromatography. An indirect competitive ELISA assay (ic-ELISA) of scFv-H6 was developed for the determination of Cry1C toxin in the range from 0.023 μg mL⁻¹ to 4.35 μg mL⁻¹, and 50% inhibition concentration (IC₅₀) was 0.39 μg mL⁻¹. This approach showed ignorable cross-reactivity with toxin Cry1Ac and Cry1B (3.51% and 7.28%, respectively). This ic-ELISA approach was exploited for the determination of Cry1C in spiked ground rice samples with a mean recovery rate of 92.5% and coefficient of variation (C.V.) less than 5.0%. This study proves that phage display libraries provide a valuable system for the low-cost, rapid and continuous generation of specific antibody fragments directed against toxin targets and develop a simple detection method.

Here we present our biophysical methodologies for the study of carbon nanoparticle uptake by Allium cepa cells and rice plants. We address the three essential aspects for such studies: identification of carbon nanoparticles in the plant species, quantification of nanotransport and aggregation in the plant compartments, and evaluation of plant responses to nanoparticle exposure on the cellular and organism level. Considering the close connection between plant and mammalian species in ecological systems especially in the food chain, we draw a direct comparison on the uptake of carbon nanoparticles in plant and mammalian cells.

Environmental and ecological samples such as paddy soils, paddy rice (unhusked), staple rice (uncooked and cooked), fish and vegetables were collected from Kandal, Kratie and Kampong Cham provinces in the Mekong River basin of Cambodia. After acid-digestion, digestates were chemically analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results revealed that the means of total arsenic concentration ([As]tot) in paddy soils and paddy rice from Kandal were significantly higher than those from Kampong Cham province (t-test, p<0.05). Moreover, a significant positive correlation between the [As]tot in paddy soils and paddy rice was found (r(14) = 0.826, p<0.01). Calculations of arsenic intake from food consumption indicated that the upper end of the range of the daily dose of inorganic arsenic for Kandal residents (0.089-8.386 μg d(-1) kg(-1) body wt.) was greater than the lower limits on the benchmark dose for a 0.5% increased incidence of lung cancer (BMDL0.5 is equal to 3.0 μg d(-1) kg(-1) body wt.).

22771816,"To better understand the spatial dynamics of non-point source (NPS) phosphorus loading with soil property at watershed scale, integrated modeling and soil chemistry is crucial to ensure that the indicator is functioning properly and expressing the spatial interaction at two depths. Developments in distributed modeling have greatly enriched the availability of geospatial data analysis and assess the NPS pollution loading response to soil property over larger area. The 1.5 km-grid soil sampling at two depths was analyzed with eight parameters, which provided detailed spatial and vertical soil data under four main types of landuses. The impacts of landuse conversion and agricultural practice on soil property were firstly identified. Except for the slightly bigger total of potassium (TK) and cadmium (Cr), the other six parameters had larger content in 20-40 cm surface than the top 20 cm surface. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was employed to simulate the loading of NPS phosphorus. Overlaying with the landuse distribution, it was found that the NPS phosphorus mainly comes from the subbasins dominated with upland and paddy rice. The linear correlations of eight soil parameters at two depths with NPS phosphorus loading in the subbasins of upland and paddy rice were compared, respectively. The correlations of available phosphorus (AP), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and TK varied in two depths, and also can assess the loading. The soil with lower soil organic carbon (SOC) presented a significant higher risk for NPS phosphorus loading, especially in agricultural area. The Principal Component Analysis showed that the TP and zinc (Zn) in top soil and copper (Cu) and Cr in subsurface can work as indicators.

The uptake of arsenic compounds in rice comes mainly from its interaction with system soil/water in the reducing conditions typical of paddy fields and is influenced by the irrigation used. We demonstrate that the use of sprinkler irrigation produces rice kernels with a concentration of total arsenic about fifty times lower when compared to rice grown under continuous flooding irrigation. The average total amount of arsenic, measured by a fully validated ICP-MS method, in 37 rice grain genotypes grown with sprinkler irrigation was 2.8 ± 2.5 μg kg(-1), whereas the average amount measured in the same genotypes grown under identical conditions, but using continuous flooding irrigation was 163 ± 23 μg kg(-1). In addition, we find that the average concentration of total arsenic in rice grains cultivated under sprinkler irrigation is close to the total arsenic concentration found in irrigation waters.

The main principle in MSSS is to search the peptide spectra set against the protein database, followed by removal of the spectra corresponding to the identified peptides to create a smaller set of the remaining peptide spectra for searching against the nucleotide sequences database. Therefore, we reduce the number of spectra to be searched to limit the peptide search space. Comparing MSSS and conventional search approach using a dataset of 27 LC-MS/MS runs of rice culture cells indicated that MSSS reduced the search queries to 50% and the search time to 75% on average. In addition, MSSS had no effect on the identification false-positive rate (FPR) or the novel peptide sequences identification ability. We used MSSS to analyze another dataset of 34 LC-MS/MS runs, resulting in identifying additional 74 novel peptides. Proteogenomic analysis with these additional peptides yielded 47 new genomic features in 24 rice genes plus 24 intergenic peptides.

For these species, the toxicological profile was not yet fully characterized in human cells. Some studies revealed that trivalent organoarsenic species are well absorbed in the intestine compared to iAs. However, other studies also indicated that a significant amount of rice-bound As reaches the colon, which may be attributed to the fibre-rich nature of the rice. Studies have revealed that microorganisms from the gut environment are important contributors to arsenic speciation changes. We aimed to study how the gut microbial metabolism affects As in different rice matrices. This was done in vitro using colon suspension from the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME system). Significant amounts of MMA(III), DMA(III) and MMMTA(V) were formed due to microbial metabolic processes like methylation and thiolation.

22645600,"RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play an important role not only in nuclear gene expression, but also in cytosolic events, including RNA transport, localization, translation, and stability. Although over 200 RBPs are predicted from the Arabidopsis genome alone, relatively little is known about these proteins in plants as many exhibit no homology to known RBPs in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, RBPs likely have low expression levels making them difficult to identify and study. As part of our continuing efforts to understand plant cytosolic gene expression and the factors involved, we employed a combination of affinity chromatography and proteomic techniques to enrich for low abundance RBPs in developing rice seed. Our results have been compiled into RiceRBP (http://www.bioinformatics2.wsu.edu/RiceRBP), a database that contains 257 experimentally identified proteins, many of which have not previously been predicted to be RBPs. For each of the identified proteins, RiceRBP provides information on transcript and protein sequence, predicted protein domains, details of the experimental identification, and whether antibodies have been generated for public use. In addition, tools are available to analyze expression patterns for the identified genes, view phylogentic relationships and search for orthologous proteins.

22632631,"Young, old, pregnant and immuno-compromised persons are of great concern for risk assessors as they represent the sub-populations most at risk. The present paper focuses on risk assessment linked to furan exposure in children. Only the Belgian population was considered because individual contamination and consumption data that are required for accurate risk assessment were available for Belgian children only. Two risk assessment approaches, the so-called deterministic and probabilistic, were applied and the results were compared for the estimation of daily intake. A significant difference between the average Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) was underlined between the deterministic (419 ng kg⁻¹ body weight (bw) day⁻¹) and the probabilistic (583 ng kg⁻¹ bw day⁻¹) approaches, which results from the mathematical treatment of the null consumption and contamination data. The risk was characterised by two ways: (1) the classical approach by comparison of the EDI to a reference dose (RfD(chronic-oral)) and (2) the most recent approach, namely the Margin of Exposure (MoE) approach. Both reached similar conclusions: the risk level is not of a major concern, but is neither negligible. In the first approach, only 2.7 or 6.6% (respectively in the deterministic and in the probabilistic way) of the studied population presented an EDI above the RfD(chronic-oral). In the second approach, the percentage of children displaying a MoE above 10,000 and below 100 is 3-0% and 20-0.01% in the deterministic and probabilistic modes, respectively. In addition, children were compared to adults and significant differences between the contamination patterns were highlighted. While major contamination was linked to coffee consumption in adults (55%), no item predominantly contributed to the contamination in children. The most important were soups (19%), dairy products (17%), pasta and rice (11%), fruit and potatoes (9% each).","Food additives & contaminants.

The main factors affecting CPE procedure, such as pH, concentration of KI, MG and surfactant, equilibrium temperature and incubation time, sample volume were investigated. Potential interference from co-existing ions was largely eliminated as most of co-existing ions can not form extractable ion-associated complex with iodide and MG.

Previously established extraction methods developed by Ross and colleagues, as well as a semiautomated method involving accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), were applied to extract ARs within freshly ground samples. For extraction of alkylresorcinols, nonpolar solvents such as ethyl acetate have been recommended for the extraction of uncooked foods, and polar solvents such as 1-propanol:water (3:1 v/v) have been recommended for the extraction of baked foods that contain rye, wheat, or other starch-rich grains. A comparison of AR extraction methods has been investigated with the application of gas chromatography and a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) to quantify the AR content. The goal of this research was to compare the rapid accelerated solvent extraction of the alkylresorcinols (ASE-AR) method to the previous manual AR extraction methods. Results for this study as well as the investigation of the overall efficiency of ASE-AR extraction with the use of a spiking study indicated that it can be comparable to current extraction methods but with less time required.

Significantly elevated levels of heavy metals in soil, rice and wheat grains indicated the heavy metals contamination of traffic emission in roadside rice-wheat rotation field. The contamination levels of Cd, Cr and Zn in wheat grain were higher than rice grain, while that of Pb showed an opposite trend. Obvious dissimilarities in the spatial distributions of heavy metals contents were found between in the soil, rice and wheat grains, indicating that the heavy metals contents in the roadside crop grains were not only determined by the concentrations of heavy metals in the paddy soil.

A gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) with a low limit of detection (LOD), and high specificity, recovery, and precision was successfully established for the PC analysis in vegetable oils. The LODs for the PCs were in the range of 0.002 to 0.016 μg/mL. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for the repeated analysis of PCs was less than 3.356%. The mean recoveries for spiked heptacosanol and octacosanol in vegetable oil were 102.3% and 106.3%, respectively. The total PC contents in the vegetable oils varied from 3.01 to 427.83 mg/kg oil. Perilla seed, grape seed, and rice bran oils were found to be highly rich sources of PCs, containing 427.83, 245.15, and 171.17 mg PCs/kg oil, respectively. Corn, sesame, and soybean oils contained only a negligible quantity of PCs. The PC composition in vegetable oils was greatly source dependent. In perilla seed oil, octacosanol was the single most predominant component, representing 55.93% of the total PC. In grape seed oil, however, hexacosanol is the most abundant PC, followed by octacosanol, tetracosanol, and triacontanol in a decreasing order. The major PCs in rice bran oil were triacontanol, octacosanol, hexacosanol, and tetracosanol, which constituted over 87.3% of the total PC.

In our previous study, reduced glutathione (GSH) was found to improve the gas-retaining properties of rice batter used for gluten-free bread. In this article, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was shown to have the same effect. Moreover, sensory tests revealed that GSSG bread had a significantly reduced sulfurous odor. Analyses by a gas chromatography-flame photometric detector demonstrated the presence of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan in the headspace of GSH bread, and also their significant reduction in GSSG bread. The viscoelastic properties and microstructures of GSSG and GSH bread did not noticeably differ. These observations suggest the usefulness of GSSG in making gluten-free rice bread and extend our knowledge of the use of glutathione in food processing. Practical Application: Glutathione, a widely-distributed peptide in cells, improves the bread-making quality of gluten-free rice batter.

The bio-accessibility of As in the samples was monitored using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results from a certified reference material as well as cooked and uncooked white rice showed that the majority of As was leached by saliva.

In rice nodes, the diffuse vascular bundles (DVBs), which enclose the enlarged elliptical vascular bundles (EVBs), are connected to the panicle and have a morphological feature that facilitates xylem-to-phloem transfer. To find a mechanism for restricting cadmium (Cd) transport into grains, the distribution of Cd, zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and sulphur (S) around the vascular bundles in node I (the node beneath the panicle) of Oryza sativa 'Koshihikari' were compared 1 week after heading. Elemental maps of Cd, Zn, Mn, and S in the vascular bundles of node I were obtained by synchrotron micro-X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and electron probe microanalysis. In addition, Cd K-edge microfocused X-ray absorption near-edge structure analyses were used to identify the elements co-ordinated with Cd. Both Cd and S were mainly distributed in the xylem of the EVB and in the parenchyma cell bridge (PCB) surrounding the EVB. Zn accumulated in the PCB, and Mn accumulated around the protoxylem of the EVB. Cd was co-ordinated mainly with S in the xylem of the EVB, but with both S and O in the phloem of the EVB and in the PCB. The EVB in the node retarded horizontal transport of Cd toward the DVB.

Fusarium strains were cultivated at 25°C for 7 days on two types of solid media, i.e. rice-flour and cereal-flour agar. Toxins produced were measured after the incubation period with a multi-mycotoxin method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Both F. sporotrichioides and F. langsethiae synthesised type-A trichothecenes, i.e. T-2 and HT-2 toxins, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and neosolaniol (NEO). In addition, both species could be verified as beauvericin producers. The toxin production occurred in both cereal-based assays but was more predominant on the carbohydrate-rich rice-flour medium. The two species were potent producers of T-2 toxin, the highest amounts measured being at a level of 20,000 μg/kg after 7 days' incubation. Differences between the species were observed regarding the quantitative production of the other trichothecenes: F. sporotrichioides was a more prolific producer of HT-2 toxin and beauvericin, whereas F. langsethiae produced higher amounts of DAS and NEO. On rice-flour assay, the toxin production was monitored during the growth period. The production started rapidly at an early growth phase and several toxins could be detected already after the 1st day of incubation, the highest concentrations being at mg/kg level. The results also indicated that the biosynthesis by F. sporotrichioides and F. langsethiae shifted towards the other type-A trichothecenes at the expense of T-2 toxin at the end of the cultivation.",Mycotoxin research,"['D002853', 'D003470', 'D002523', 'D005670', 'D009183', 'D053719', 'D013696', 'D013997']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Culture Media', 'Edible Grain', 'Fusarium', 'Mycotoxins', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",Mycotoxin production of Fusarium langsethiae and Fusarium sporotrichioides on cereal-based substrates.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000382', 'Q000254', 'Q000096', None, None, None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'microbiology', 'growth & development', 'biosynthesis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23605980,2013

Soils and maize tissues were sampled from 40 farms in Tanzania and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in the United Kingdom. The results showed high levels of PTEs in both soils and maize tissues above the recommended limits.

The grains and shoots with high levels of Ni and Pb are unfit for human and animal consumption. Concentrations of individual elements in maize tissues and soils did not correlate and showed differences in uptake and translocation. However, Ni showed a more efficient transfer from soils to shoots than As, Pb and Cr. Transfer of Cr and Ni from shoots to grains was higher than other elements, implying that whatever amount is assimilated in maize shoots is efficiently mobilized and transferred to grains.

Indeed, LCCs are known to shield cellulose from enzymatic hydrolysis, reducing the efficiency of the digestion processes needed for the production of biobased products. This study is focused on the chromatographic characterization of lignocellulose from agricultural residues (rice husk, wheat straw) and herbaceous energy crops ( Arundo donax ,  Miscanthus sinesis ) and their fractionation products (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin). Exploiting alternative chemical derivatizations on the aforementioned samples, it was possible to discern the connectivity among the various lignocellulosic components. The complete acetylation and benzoylation of the milled native substrates in ionic liquid media, and the systematic comparison between their GPC-UV chromatograms collected at different wavelengths has revealed itself as a straightforward technique in the detection of LCCs. This novel approach proved an extensive connectivity between the lignin and the hemicellulosic for all the analyzed specimens, whereas the cellulosic fraction was conceived as a substantially unbound moiety, accounting for the sample composition at higher molecular weights.

This paper describes the first accurate LC-MS/MS method developed to analyze tricothecenes in grains by applying multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transition and MS(3) quantitation strategies in tandem. The tricothecenes are nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside, fusarenon X, 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, diacetoxyscirpenol, and HT-2 and T-2 toxins. Acetic acid and ammonium acetate were used to convert the analytes into their respective acetate adducts and ammonium adducts under negative and positive MS polarity conditions, respectively. The mycotoxins were separated by reversed-phase LC in a 13.5-min run, ionized using electrospray ionization, and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Analyte-specific mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios were used to perform quantitation under MRM transition and MS(3) (linear ion trap) modes. Three experiments were made for each quantitation mode and matrix in batches over 6 days for recovery studies. The matrix effect was investigated at concentration levels of 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 μg kg(-1) (n = 3) in 5 g corn flour and rice flour. Extraction with acetonitrile provided a good overall recovery range of 90-108% (n = 3) at three levels of spiking concentration of 40, 80, and 120 μg kg(-1). A quantitation limit of 2-6 μg kg(-1) was achieved by applying an MRM transition quantitation strategy. Under MS(3) mode, a quantitation limit of 4-10 μg kg(-1) was achieved. Relative standard deviations of 2-10% and 2-11% were reported for MRM transition and MS(3) quantitation, respectively.

Furthermore, all these protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry to match 27 diverse protein species. The identified proteins were involved in several processes, including stress response, redox homeostasis, signal transduction, regulation and metabolism; some were found to be cellular structure proteins and a few were unknown. Among the up-regulated proteins, OsTCTP (translationally controlled tumor protein) was chosen to perform hetereologous expression in yeast which was presumed to participate in the Hg2+ tolerance of rice, providing evidence for its role in alleviating Hg2+ damage. Among the many tests, we found that OsTCTP-overexpressed yeast strains were more resistant to Hg2+ than wild-type yeast. Thus, we propose that OsTCTP contributes to Hg2+ resistance.

Little is known about the physiological factors that drive this host preference. Here, we report a feeding study with natural host plants and an artificial diet containing cyanide. We found that corn, two Cynodon spp. (bermudagrass C. dactylon (L.) Persoon, 'NuMex Sahara', and stargrass C. nlemfuensis var. nlemfuensis Vanderyst, 'Florona'), and a hybrid between bermudagrass and stargrass, 'Tifton 85', exhibited differences in the concentration of the cyanogenic precursors or cyanogenic potential (HCNp) and the release of hydrogen cyanide per unit time or cyanogenic capacity (HCNc). Corn plants released low levels of hydrogen cyanide, while stargrass had greater HCNp/HCNc than bermudagrass and 'Tifton 85'. Feeding studies showed that corn strain larvae experienced higher mortality than the rice strain when fed stargrass or artificial diet supplemented with cyanide. Also, corn strain larvae excreted higher levels of cyanogenic compounds than the rice strain when fed Cynodon spp. These differences in excretion suggest potential disparities in cyanide metabolism between the two strains.

22160725,"Accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains poses a potential health problem, especially in Asia. Most Cd in rice grains accumulates through phloem transport, but the molecular mechanism of this transport has not been revealed. In this study, we identified a rice Cd transporter, OsLCT1, involved in Cd transport to the grains. OsLCT1-GFP was localized at the plasma membrane in plant cells, and OsLCT1 showed Cd efflux activity in yeast. In rice plants, strong OsLCT1 expression was observed in leaf blades and nodes during the reproductive stage. In the uppermost node, OsLCT1 transcripts were detected around large vascular bundles and in diffuse vascular bundles. RNAi-mediated knockdown of OsLCT1 did not affect xylem-mediated Cd transport but reduced phloem-mediated Cd transport. The knockdown plants of OsLCT1 accumulated approximately half as much Cd in the grains as did the control plants. The content of other metals in rice grains and plant growth were not negatively affected by OsLCT1 suppression. These results suggest that OsLCT1 functions at the nodes in Cd transport into grains and that in a standard japonica cultivar, the regulation of OsLCT1 enables the generation of ""low-Cd rice"" without negative effects on agronomical traits.

22159463,"Rice is a staple food yet is a significant dietary source of inorganic arsenic, a class 1, nonthreshold carcinogen. Establishing the location and speciation of arsenic within the edible rice grain is essential for understanding the risk and for developing effective strategies to reduce grain arsenic concentrations. Conversely, selenium is an essential micronutrient and up to 1 billion people worldwide are selenium-deficient. Several studies have suggested that selenium supplementation can reduce the risk of some cancers, generating substantial interest in biofortifying rice. Knowledge of selenium location and speciation is important, because the anti-cancer effects of selenium depend on its speciation. Germanic acid is an arsenite/silicic acid analogue, and location of germanium may help elucidate the mechanisms of arsenite transport into grain. This review summarises recent discoveries in the location and speciation of arsenic, germanium, and selenium in rice grain using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry and synchrotron techniques, and illustrates both the importance of high-sensitivity and high-resolution techniques and the advantages of combining techniques in an integrated quantitative and spatial approach.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D001151', 'D005506', 'D005857', 'D013058', 'D012275', 'D012639', 'D012643', 'D017356']","['Arsenic', 'Food Contamination', 'Germanium', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oryza', 'Seeds', 'Selenium', 'Synchrotrons']",A review of recent developments in the speciation and location of arsenic and selenium in rice grain.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22159463,2012

In this study, Cd levels in 327 and 94 samples of Bangladeshi food and non-food samples, respectively, were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. This is the largest number of Bangladeshi food and nonfood samples investigated for their Cd content. High Cd levels were detected in leafy vegetables (mean 31 [SD 29]μg/kg). Of these vegetables, lal shak (Amaranthus tricolor) contained the highest Cd level (303 μg/kg [wet weight]; mean 100.5 [SD 95]μg/kg). Bangladeshi rice also showed significant concentration of Cd (mean 37.2 [SD 30]μg/kg). Of particular concern is the very high level of Cd detected in some puffed rice, which we attribute to the illegal practice of using urea for whitening the puffed rice. Tobacco leaves, which are commonly consumed during betel quid chewing by Bangladeshis, contain significant levels of Cd (mean 95 [SD 87]μg/kg). The total daily intake (TDI) of Cd from foods for Bangladeshis was estimated to be 34.55 μg/d. This is rather high when compared to the TDI of Cd for other populations. Our analysis reveals that this is mainly due to the very high intake of rice and vegetables, and lower consumption of animal products (which are low in Cd), by the Bangladeshis. We also determined the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake and target hazard quotients values for Cd.

We analyzed 263 paired groundwater and paddy soil samples covering highland (HL) and medium highland-1 (MHL-1) land types for geostatistical mapping of soil As and delineation of As contaminated areas in Tala Upazilla, Satkhira district. We also collected 74 non-rice soil samples to assess the baseline concentration of soil As for this area. The mean soil As concentrations (mg/kg) for different land types under rice and non-rice crops were: rice-MHL-1 (21.2)>rice-HL (14.1)>non-rice-MHL-1 (11.9)>non-rice-HL (7.2). Multiple regression analyses showed that irrigation water As, Fe, land elevation and years of tubewell operation are the important factors affecting the concentrations of As in HL paddy soils. Only years of tubewell operation affected As concentration in the MHL-1 paddy soils. Quantitatively similar increases in soil As above the estimated baseline-As concentration were observed for rice soils on HL and MHL-1 after 6-8 years of groundwater irrigation, implying strong retention of As added in irrigation water in both land types. Application of single geostatistical methods with secondary variables such as regression kriging (RK) and ordinary co-kriging (OCK) gave little improvement in prediction of soil As over ordinary kriging (OK). Comparing single prediction methods, kriging within strata (KWS), the combination of RK for HL and OCK for MHL-1, gave more accurate soil As predictions and showed the lowest misclassification of declaring a location ""contaminated"" with respect to 14.8 mg As/kg, the highest value obtained for the baseline soil As concentration.

22038417,"Rice (Oryza sativa) cv. Nipponbare expresses non-host resistance (NHR) to the wheat leaf rust fungus, Puccinia triticina f. sp. tritici (Ptt). When the leaves of cv. Nipponbare were inoculated with Ptt, approx 93% of the urediniospores germinated on the leaf surface, but only 10% of the germinated spores formed appressoria over the stomata at one day post inoculation (1 dpi). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) accumulated in host cells around the appressoria at 3 dpi. Approx. 3% of the appressoria produced short hyphae inside the leaf, and fluorescence was observed in tissue invaded by the hyphae by 7 dpi. At 22 dpi, 0.2% of the sites with appressoria formed branching infection hypha in mesophyll cells, but no substomatal vesicles, haustorial mother cells or haustoria were observed. Proteins were extracted from leaves 3 dpi and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). A total 33 spots were reproducibly up-regulated and 9 were down-regulated by infection compared to the water inoculated control. Of these, 30 were identified by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry. The identified proteins participate in defense/stress responses, energy/carbohydrate metabolism, oxidation-reduction processes, protein folding/turnover/cleavage/degradation, signal transduction and cell death regulation. The results indicates that NHR of rice to Ptt is consistent with a shift in protein and energy metabolism, increased antimicrobial activities, possibly including phytoalexin accumulation and cell wall reinforcement, increased cell repair, antioxidive and detoxification reactions, and enhanced prevention of plant cell death.

Antioxidant protection is normally achieved through a balance between pro-oxidants and endogenous and/or dietary antioxidants. Comprehensive research is required on optimization to achieve good antioxidant protection through infant foods, in particular, the commercially available infant cereals. This study therefore investigated the properties of whole purple wheat, unpolished red rice, and partially polished red rice before and after processing to produce infant cereals. Total phenolic content (TPC), total anthocyanin content (TAC), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), individual anthocyanin components, and cellular antioxidant activity were measured. Home-made and laboratory-made pigmented infant cereals differed in that the latter required longer exposure to higher temperature and enzymatic hydrolysis. Home-made and laboratory-made unpolished red rice infant cereals showed higher total phenolic contents and peroxyl radical scavenging activity than home-made and laboratory-made purple wheat infant cereals; however, the latter had higher TAC. Pigmented infant cereals generally had higher TPC, TAC, and ORAC than the commercial ones (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were identified in whole purple wheat, but they were not detected in unpolished red rice. C-Glycosyl apigenin was found in both whole purple wheat and unpolished red rice. Processing significantly decreased anthocyanin and C-glycosyl apigenin contents (p < 0.05).

22026389,"We investigated in total 80 wine samples of different types and seven grape juice and 23 beer samples purchased from markets in Central Europe in order to understand the arsenic (As) speciation and help assess the potential As toxicity via intake of alcoholic beverages. Generally, total As concentrations in most samples investigated were below the drinking water limit 10 µg l(-1) published by the World Health Organization (WHO); ranging from 0.46 to 21.0 µg l(-1) As in red and white wines and from 0.75 to 13.4 µg l(-1) As in beers. In addition, concentrations of total As in rice wine and in rice beer were 0.63-6.07 and 3.69-8.23 µg l(-1) As, respectively. The total As concentrations in ice wine ranged from 7.94 to 18.8 µg l(-1) As, significantly higher than in white and red wine. Arsenite predominated as the As species in most of the wine samples, whereas arsenate was the dominant species in rice wine, beer and rice beer. Methyl As components were usually minor components in all wine and beer samples. Monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid and two additional unknown As species were frequently found in grape juice, late harvest and ice wine with higher sweetness. After air exposure, arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid were stable at 4°C for months, probably due to the acidic conditions of wine and beer samples. The presence of sulfite had little influence on As speciation in wine. Despite the predominance of more toxic arsenite and arsenate in wine and beer, the estimated weekly exposure to As (via consumption of beer, wine and rice wine) is low. The As intake per capita is 6.81 µg from beer, <1.93 µg from wine and 0.88 µg from rice wine, estimated using the median of total As concentration multiplied by the average consumption per capita of the corresponding beverage.","Food additives & contaminants.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between blood cadmium concentration (BCdC) and food consumption, nutrients intake (Ca, Fe, Zn, vitamin C, and vitamin D), tobacco smoking, and some other variables (age, body mass index, and residence) in 243 adults living in the Italian island of Sardinia (Sassari Province). Specifically, we hypothesized that offal consumption contributes to Cd intakes and blood levels. The BCdC was quantified by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, and information on personal data was collected through questionnaires. Smoke significantly contributed to the BCdC (P < .001). Nonsmoker subjects who eat offal showed significantly higher BCdC (P = .04). Moreover, slightly higher BCdCs were also observed in nonsmoker subjects who eat rice, fish, and bread. The BCdC positively correlated with age of subjects (r = 0.144; P = .025) and offal daily intake in nonsmokers (r = 0.393; P < .001). The intake of Ca was negatively correlated (r = -0.281; P = .001) with the BCdC in females.

21925977,"The new pre-concentration technique, hollow fiber-solid phase microextraction based on carbon nanotube reinforced sol-gel and liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection was applied to determination of aflatoxins B(1), B(2) (AFB(1), AFB(2)) in rice, peanut and wheat samples. This research provides an overview of trends related to synthesis of solid phase microextraction (SPME) sorbnents that improves the assay of aflatoxins as the semi-polar compounds in several real samples. It mainly includes summary and a list of the results for a simple carbon nanotube reinforced sol-gel in-fiber device. This device was used for extraction, pre-concentration and determination of aflatoxins B1, B2 in real samples. In this technique carbon nanotube reinforced sol was prepared by the sol-gel method via the reaction of phenyl trimethoxysilane (PTMS) with a basic catalyst (tris hydroxymethyl aminomethan). The influences of microextraction parameters such as pH, ageing time, carbon nanotube contents, desorption conditions, desorption solvent and agitation speed were investigated. Optimal HPLC conditions were: C(18) reversed phase column for separation, water-acetonitril-methanol (35:10:55) as the mobile phase and maximum wavelength for detection was 370 nm. The method was evaluated statistically and under optimized conditions, the detection limits for the analytes were 0.074 and 0.061 ng/mL for B1 and B2 respectively. Limit of quantification for B1 and B2 was 0.1 ng/mL too (n=7). The precisions were in the range of 2.829-2.976% (n=3), and linear ranges were within 0.1 and 400 ng/mL.

21920630,"Rice is the staple food for more than fifty percent of the world's population, and is therefore an important crop. However, its production is hindered by several biotic and abiotic stresses. Although rice is the only crop that can germinate even in the complete absence of oxygen (i.e. anoxia), flooding (low oxygen) is one of the major causes of reduced rice production. Rice germination under anoxia is characterized by the elongation of the coleoptile, but leaf growth is hampered. In this work, a comparative proteomic approach was used to detect and identify differentially expressed proteins in the anoxic rice coleoptile compared to the aerobic coleoptile. Thirty-one spots were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The majority of the identified proteins were related to stress responses and redox metabolism.

In this study, we investigated the similarities and differences in the accumulations of phytohormones and FAs in the resistant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) 'Molly' and the nonhost rice (Oryza sativa L.) 'Niponbare' in responses to Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), larval attacks. Using chemical ionization-gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry, we analyzed the concentrations of 13 phytohomones and FAs at the attack site of wheat and rice plants at 1, 6, 24, or 48 h after the initial attack. Hessian fly attack resulted in increases of salicylic acid (SA), 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), palmitic acid (FA16:0), but a decrease of abscisic acid in both wheat and rice plants. In addition, the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) increased, whereas the accumulation of cinnamic acid (CA) decreased in wheat plants, but no changes were observed in the accumulation of JA, and the accumulation of CA increased in rice plants after Hessian fly attack. However, the accumulations of benzoic acid, strearic acid (FA18:0), and oleic acid (FA18:1) increased in rice plants, but no changes were observed in wheat plants after Hessian fly attack. Hessian fly-induced changes were more rapid in wheat plants in comparison with those in rice plants.

21879858,"The widespread incidence of chronic arsenicosis in the Bengal Delta has led to intensive research on arsenic (As) enrichment in groundwater as well as accumulation in foodstuffs, as there are potential health risks associated with exposure to As from both sources. This study deals with human As exposure through the drinking of groundwater, consumption of locally grown foodstuffs (e.g., crops and vegetables) and cooked food in Nadia district, West Bengal. Groundwater and foodstuffs were collected and analyzed with FI-HG-AAS to estimate the total As content. Urine samples collected from human subjects were analyzed to assess the As exposure. Two major crops, boro and aman rice, showed a considerable amount of As, with mean values of 194 and 156 μg kg(-1), respectively. Significant levels of As were also found in other common crops and vegetables cultivated in this area (for example, the mean As in Arum and radish was 780 and 674 μg kg(-1), respectively). Total intake of As from foodstuffs by adults (560 μg day(-1)) and children (393 μg day(-1)) in the area was found to be at alarming levels. Arsenic exposure was demonstrated by the presence of As in urine (ranging between 154 and 276 μg L(-1)), with overall As retention of 50-60 %. The results of this study further indicate the potential risk of As exposure to local inhabitants through the food chain which is associated with continuous consumption of As-contaminated foodstuffs. Therefore, more action needs to be taken to control the contamination pathways (such as the water-soil-crop system) to protect humans from continuous ingestion of As through foodstuffs.","Journal of environmental science and health.

This method gives toxicological meaning to arsenic analysis, since the sum of the toxic chemical forms As(III) and As(V) can be determined. In contrast to classical water-methanol extraction, UAEE enables drastic acceleration of sample extraction (5 min instead of several hours), while total arsenic extraction efficiency is improved without species conversion.

In this paper, PNIPA gel was prepared and applied as a novel polymer coating for fiber-in-tube capillary microextraction of trace Co, Ni and Cd followed by on-line ICP-MS detection. The PNIPA coating was synthesized by using ethylene triethoxysilane (ETEOS) as the cross-linking agent under acidic conditions. This siloxane incorporated PNIPA gel achieves a dramatically rapid response rate when the external temperature is changed. The micro-structure of PNIPA coating was examined by scanning electron micrograph (SEM). Various experimental parameters including pH, temperature, sample flow rate and volume, elution solution and interfering ions affecting the extraction of the target analytes have been carefully investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection were 0.45, 4.6 and 6.9 ng L(-1) for Co, Ni and Cd, respectively. With a sampling frequency of 13 h(-1), the relative standard deviations (RSDs) for Co, Ni and Cd were 4.8, 5.1 and 6.4% (C=1 μg L(-1), n=7), respectively.

21490163,"Rice (Oryza sativa) takes up arsenite mainly through the silicic acid transport pathway. Understanding the uptake and sequestration of arsenic (As) into the rice plant is important for developing strategies to reduce As concentration in rice grain. In this study, the cellular and subcellular distributions of As and silicon (Si) in rice roots were investigated using high-pressure freezing, high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Rice plants, both the lsi2 mutant lacking the Si/arsenite efflux transporter Lsi2 and its wild-type cultivar, with or without an iron plaque, were treated with arsenate or arsenite. The formation of iron plaque on the root surface resulted in strong accumulation of As and phosphorous on the epidermis. The lsi2 mutant showed stronger As accumulation in the endodermal vacuoles, where the Lsi2 transporter is located in the plasma membranes, than the wild-type line. As also accumulated in the vacuoles of some xylem parenchyma cells and in some pericycle cells, particularly in the wild-type mature root zone. Vacuolar accumulation of As is associated with sulfur, suggesting that As may be stored as arsenite-phytochelatin complexes. Si was localized in the cell walls of the endodermal cells with little apparent effect of the Lsi2 mutation on its distribution.

In this study, the quantification of selected metals in various oils and fats (rice oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, soy oil, olive oil, light margarine, regular margarine and butter) was carried out using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) after sample emulsification. FAAS was used to determine the Na, K, Ca, Mg, Zn and Fe levels in the samples, while GFAAS was used for quantifying Cr, Ni, As, Pb, Cd, Cu and Mn, as these elements appeared in the samples at much lower concentrations. Tween-80 and Triton X-100 were employed as surfactants, and emulsions were prepared by a conventional method that involved heating and mixing of the constituents. Complete stabilisation was achieved through magnetic stirring for 15 min at room temperature. The evaluated figures of merit were linearity, accuracy and sensitivity, which were determined by the characteristic concentration and mass. Analysis of spiked samples demonstrated accuracy, which ranged from 90% (Na) to 112% (Fe) for FAAS and from 83% (Cd) to 121% (Pb) for GFAAS measurements. Atomic absorption spectrometry proved to be a promising approach for the analysis of metals in emulsified edible oils and fats.

21391495,"The Monascus fermentation product red mold rice (RMR) has been found to contain the cholesterol-lowering agent monacolin K (MK) in both its lactone (MKL) and acid (MKA) forms and the mycotoxin citrinin (CT). The yellow pigments in RMR, namely, monascin (MS) and ankaflavin (AK), have been reported to exhibit antimetastatic and antiangiogenic activities. Currently, MK and these yellow pigments are usually detected in RMR by different analytical methods that are inconvenient, expensive, and time-consuming. The goal of this study was to establish a rapid, synchronous analytical method for determination of the MKA, MKL, MS, AK, and CT levels in RMR. MKA, MKL, MS, AK, and CT were extracted by the same extraction method, then separated by RP-HPLC with a C18 column. The effluent from the column was passed through a photodiode array detector and then introduced directly into a fluorescence detector. The results showed that high recovery rates of MKA, MKL, MS, AK, and CT are possible if RMR powder is extracted with 75% ethanol (10 mL) at 80 degrees C for 30 min. With regard to the optimal conditions of the HPLC, the peaks of MKA, MKL, MS, AK, and CT can be clearly separated from any noise peaks by isocratic elution with a mobile phase comprising 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile-water (62.5 + 37.5, v/v).",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002851', 'D002953', 'D005285', 'D005415', 'D005504', 'D005516', 'D006575', 'D008148', 'D013058', 'D032741', 'D012275', 'D012015']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Citrinin', 'Fermentation', 'Flavins', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Microbiology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring', 'Lovastatin', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Monascus', 'Oryza', 'Reference Standards']","Synchronous high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector and mass spectrometry for the determination of citrinin, monascin, ankaflavin, and the lactone and acid forms of monacolin K in red mold rice.","['Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000031', 'Q000379', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None]","['methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'analogs & derivatives', 'methods', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21391495,2011
21388416,"Analysis of rice plants exposed to a broad range of relatively low and environmentally realistic Cd concentrations showed that the root capacity to retain Cd ions rose from 49 to 79%, corresponding to increases in the external Cd²+ concentration in the 0.01-1 µM range. Fractioning of Cd ions retained by roots revealed that different events along the metal sequestration pathway (i.e. chelation by thiols, vacuolar compartmentalization, adsorption) contributed to Cd immobilization in the roots. However, large amounts of Cd ions (around 24% of the total amount) predictable as potentially mobile were still found in all conditions, while the amount of Cd ions loaded in the xylem seemed to have already reached saturation at 0.1 µM Cd²+, suggesting that Cd translocation may also play an indirect role in determining Cd root retention, especially at the highest external concentrations. In silico search and preliminary analyses in yeast suggest OsHMA2 as a good candidate for the control of Cd xylem loading in rice.

Phytochemical investigations and spectroscopic studies of the diethyl ether fraction of methanolic extract of Njavara Black (NB) rice bran gave three important compounds namely, tricin and two rare flavonolignans- tricin 4'-O-(erythro-β-guaiacylglyceryl) ether and tricin 4'-O-(threo-β-guaiacylglyceryl) ether. The EC(50) values of these compounds in DPPH system were 90.39, 352.04 and 208.1 μg/ml, respectively. Quantification of the compounds by HPLC in NB and staple, non-medicinal rice varieties Sujatha (SJ) and Palakkadan Matta (PM) showed that tricin is present 39.64 and 16.12 fold higher in NB, compared to SJ and PM, respectively. This is the first report on the occurrence of tricin at significantly higher levels in Njavara and occurrence of the two flavonolignans in Oryza sativa species.

Another type of binding (or association) relates to observed instability of fumonisins in rice flour, corn starch and corn meal at room temperature; this can affect the immunoaffinity column clean-up procedure in analysis of naturally contaminated starch-containing corn foods for fumonisins. The occurrence of N-fatty acylated fumonisin derivatives in retail fried corn foods has also been demonstrated.

21306106,Emerging evidence supporting chronic disease fighting properties of rice bran has advanced the development of stabilized rice bran for human use as a functional food and dietary supplement. A global and targeted metabolomic investigation of stabilized rice bran fermented with Saccharomyces boulardii was performed in three rice varieties. Metabolites from S. boulardii-fermented rice bran were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and assessed for bioactivity compared to nonfermented rice bran in normal and malignant lymphocytes. Global metabolite profiling revealed significant differences in the metabolome that led to discovery of candidate compounds modulated by S. boulardii fermentation. Fermented rice bran extracts from three rice varieties reduced growth of human B lymphomas compared to each variety's nonfermented control and revealed that fermentation differentially altered bioactive compounds.

21261203,"Arsenic contamination of tubewell water is a major public-health problem in Bangladesh. In the recent years, the use of shallow and deep tubewell water for irrigation and the use of excess amount of cheap fertilizers and pesticides containing cadmium pose a serious threat of contamination of arsenic and cadmium in food. In an exploratory study, arsenic and cadmium were measured in foods from Matlab, a rural area in Bangladesh, that is extensively affected by arsenic and the economy is agriculture-based. Raw and cooked food samples were collected from village homes (households, n=13) and analyzed to quantify concentrations of arsenic and cadmium using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Washing rice with water before cooking reduced the concentration of arsenic in raw rice by 13-15%. Rice, when cooked with excess water discarded, showed a significant decrease in arsenic concentration compared to that cooked without discarding the water (p<0.001). In contrast, concentration of cadmium did not decrease in cooked rice after discarding water. Cooked rice with discarded water had significantly lower concentration of arsenic compared to raw rice (p=0.002). Raw rice had higher concentration of arsenic compared to raw vegetables (p<0.001); however, no such difference was found for cadmium. Compared to raw vegetables (e.g. arum), concentration of arsenic increased significantly (p=0.024) when cooked with arsenic-contaminated water. Thus, the practice of discarding excess water while cooking rice reduces the concentration of arsenic but not of cadmium in cooked rice. However, water generally not discarded when cooking vegetables to avoid loss of micronutrients consequently retains arsenic. The results suggest that arsenic and cadmium have entered the food-chain of Bangladesh, and the cooking practices influence the concentration of arsenic but not of cadmium in cooked food.","Journal of health, population, and nutrition","['D001151', 'D001459', 'D002104', 'D003296', 'D005504', 'D020387', 'D005506', 'D010865', 'D012423']","['Arsenic', 'Bangladesh', 'Cadmium', 'Cooking', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Chain', 'Food Contamination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Rural Health']",Arsenic and cadmium in food-chain in Bangladesh--an exploratory study.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000517', None, None]","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'prevention & control', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21261203,2011

Multiple models for diagnosing As contamination in rice based on spectral parameters were studied. Sixty samples belonging to mature rice in three different areas were scanned by ASD field pro3 for optical data. Arsenic reference values were obtained by atomic absorption spectrometry. First, correlation analysis was used between 9 hyperspectral indices and As content in rice, and three indices (PSNDa, fWBI, SIPI) were extracted to diagnose As contamination in rice, which were respectively sensitive to chlorophyll, water content and structure of leaves, then took the three indices to form a diagnosis spectral indices space (PSNDa-fWBI, PSNDa-SIPI, fWBI-SIPI) of As stress in rice.

21220762,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) possess significant phytase activity in the mature grains. Maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) possess little or virtually no preformed phytase activity in the mature grain and depend fully on de novo synthesis during germination. Here, it is demonstrated that wheat, barley, maize, and rice all possess purple acid phosphatase (PAP) genes that, expressed in Pichia pastoris, give fully functional phytases (PAPhys) with very similar enzyme kinetics. Preformed wheat PAPhy was localized to the protein crystalloid of the aleurone vacuole. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that PAPhys possess four conserved domains unique to the PAPhys. In barley and wheat, the PAPhy genes can be grouped as PAPhy_a or PAPhy_b isogenes (barley, HvPAPhy_a, HvPAPhy_b1, and HvPAPhy_b2; wheat, TaPAPhy_a1, TaPAPhy_a2, TaPAPhy_b1, and TaPAPhy_b2). In rice and maize, only the b type (OsPAPhy_b and ZmPAPhy_b, respectively) were identified. HvPAPhy_a and HvPAPhy_b1/b2 share 86% and TaPAPhya1/a2 and TaPAPhyb1/b2 share up to 90% (TaPAPhy_a2 and TaPAPhy_b2) identical amino acid sequences. despite of this, PAPhy_a and PAPhy_b isogenes are differentially expressed during grain development and germination. In wheat, it was demonstrated that a and b isogene expression is driven by different promoters (approximately 31% identity). TaPAPhy_a/b promoter reporter gene expression in transgenic grains and peptide mapping of TaPAPhy purified from wheat bran and germinating grains confirmed that the PAPhy_a isogene set present in wheat/barley but not in rice/maize is the origin of high phytase activity in mature grains.",Plant physiology,"['D010832', 'D000135', 'D000595', 'D003001', 'D018076', 'D015971', 'D018506', 'D018525', 'D006023', 'D001467', 'D007700', 'D008969', 'D012275', 'D010802', 'D010944', 'D012639', 'D016415', 'D053719', 'D013997', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['6-Phytase', 'Acid Phosphatase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Germination', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hordeum', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oryza', 'Phylogeny', 'Plants', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Time Factors', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']","Cloning and characterization of purple acid phosphatase phytases from wheat, barley, maize, and rice.","['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000201', 'Q000166', None, None, None, 'Q000166', 'Q000201']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'genetics', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'enzymology', None, None, 'enzymology', None, 'enzymology', 'cytology', None, None, None, 'cytology', 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21220762,2011

The results, calculated in mg kg(-1) (wet weight) for each sample, revealed the general scenario of food safety in Taiwan: As (0.005-12.04), Cd (<0.0005-2.22), Cr (0.014-6.95), Cu (0.012-8.70), Pb (0.001-0.64), Se (<0.001-1.29) and Zn (0.020-67.02). Three food samples were identified with As concentrations higher than regulatory limits: a dietary supplement sample and a seaweed sample with As concentrations that exceeded the limit of Taiwan's health food standard of 2 mg kg(-1), and a canned eel sample with an As concentration that exceeded the limit of Canada's fish standard of 3.5 mg kg(-1). This study suggests that the estimated intakes of these seven trace elements from the consumption of foods containing Monascus pose little risk, as the trace element contents in the majority of samples were lower than the permissible/tolerable intakes per week according to the guidelines recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO). Moreover, their concentrations in foods containing Monascus differ widely for different food varieties, suggesting that external contaminants and raw materials are the main sources of trace elements.

Fipronil, a pyrazole insecticide with strong activity against larval Culex species, was tested for its acute effects on Simocephalus elizabethae (Daphniidae) and Polypedilum nubiferum (Chironomidae), two non-target invertebrates associated with Australian rice field mosquito habitats. Technical and formulated fipronil were assessed in the presence or absence of particulate artificial diets in 48 h static bioassays. LC(50) values for neonate S. elizabethae ranged from 11.13 to 19.12 μgl(-1) whilst those for final instar P. nubiferum ranged from 0.89 to 2.18 μgl(-1). Feeding during exposure significantly reduced the susceptibility of P. nubiferum to both technical and formulated fipronil. The effect of feeding was less consistent in Simocephalus bioassays, where much less food was present. We investigated whether adsorption to unconsumed food particles may have limited fipronil bioavailability by using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography to measure the available fipronil from fed and unfed systems 24h after establishment. Differences between the systems were not significant (P>0.05). The significantly higher LC(50) values in the fed Polypedilum bioassays do not appear to be a consequence of reduced fipronil bioavailability. Observed differences in toxicity probably reflect increased stresses associated with food deprivation in the unfed bioassays.

21044677,"Although, nanometer-scale semi-conductor quantum dots (QDs) have attracted widespread interest in medical diagnosis and treatment, many can have intrinsic toxicities, especially those composed of CdSe, associated with their elemental composition. Using our self-assembling nanoemulsion (SANE) formulations which we have previously reported to be composed of non-toxic components, i.e., such as vegetable oil, surfactant and water, we hypothesized that their appropriate utilization would reduce the toxicity of QDs by encapsulating the CdSe QDs in our (SANE) system using a modified phase-inversion temperature (PIT) method. SANE encapsulation of the QDs did not alter their emission wavelength of 600nm which remained unchanged during the encapsulation process. In contrast, zeta potential of encapsulated QDs was reduced from -30 to -6.59 mV, which we have previously reported to be associated with beneficial properties (increased bioavailability and efficacy) for SANE-encapsulated bioactives such as pharmaceuticals. Relative to the untreated controls, the viability of HeLa cells exposed for 48 h to un-encapsulated CdSe QDs at a concentration of 115 μg/mL was 22.7±1.7% (p<0.05). In contrast, the percentage of viable HeLa cells following exposure to SANE-encapsulated CdSe QDs at the same concentration was 91.6±3.5% (p<0.05) or a 307% increase in the number of viable cells (p<0.05). When the dose of CdSe QDs was increased to 230 μg/mL, the percentage of viable HeLa cells after exposure to the un-encapsulated CdSe QDs was 16.1±1.3% compared to controls (p<0.05). In contrast, at the same increased concentration (230 μg/mL) of un-encapsulated CdSe QDs, the percentage of viable HeLa cells following exposure to SANE-encapsulated CdSe QDs was 87.9±3.3% relative to controls (p<0.05) or a 448% increase in the number of viable cells (p<0.05). Exposure of HeLa cells to a nanoblank, (nanoemulsion without QDs), showed no significant effect on cell viability (97.2±2.5%) compared to control cell culture. In conclusion, application of our SANE technology for encapsulating QDs increased cell viability of cells exposed to CdSe QDs while maintaining the original emission wavelength and therefore may be applied to reduce QD toxicity.",Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,"['D019187', 'D002470', 'D055598', 'D004655', 'D006367', 'D006801', 'D049329', 'D036103', 'D010316', 'D010938', 'D045663', 'D000073879', 'D018036', 'D013050', 'D013440', 'D013499', 'D013501', 'D044366', 'D017967']","['Cadmium Compounds', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Emulsions', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Nanostructures', 'Nanotechnology', 'Particle Size', 'Plant Oils', 'Quantum Dots', 'Rice Bran Oil', 'Selenium Compounds', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Sulfides', 'Surface Properties', 'Surface-Active Agents', 'Transition Temperature', 'Zinc Compounds']",Encapsulation of cadmium selenide quantum dots using a self-assembling nanoemulsion (SANE) reduces their in vitro toxicity.,"['Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21044677,2011

Mycotoxins were extracted with methanol : water (80 : 20) and purified with a multifunctional AOZ immunoaffinity column before HPLC analysis. The validation of the analytical method was performed to establish the following parameters: specificity, selectivity, linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), accuracy, precision (within- and between-day variability), stability, robustness, measurement of performance, and measurement of uncertainty. Calibration curves were linear (r > 0.999) over the concentration range, from the LOQ to 26, 40 and 400 ng/g for AFs, OTA and ZEA, respectively. LOD and LOQ were 0.0125 and 0.05 ng/g for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and G1 (AFG1), 0.0037 and 0.015 ng/g for aflatoxin B2 (AFB2) and G2 (AFG2), as well as 0.05 and 0.2 ng/g for OTA and 0.5 and 2 ng/g for ZEA, respectively. The mean recovery values were 77-104% for different concentrations of AFs, OTA and ZEA in spiked cereal samples. Both intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were within acceptable limits. This method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of mycotoxins for 60 cereal samples collected from Malaysian markets. Fifty per cent of the cereal samples were contaminated with at least one of these mycotoxins, at a level greater than the LOD. Only one wheat sample and two rice samples were contaminated with levels greater than the European Union regulatory limits for AFs and OTA (4 and 5 ng/g).

To study the biological function of the cell wall and the regulation of cell wall resynthesis, we examined cellular responses to enzymatic removal of the cell wall in rice (Oryza sativa) suspension cells using proteomic approaches. We find that removal of cell wall stimulates cell wall synthesis from multiple sites in protoplasts instead of from a single site as in cytokinesis. Nucleus DAPI stain and MNase digestion further show that removal of the cell wall is concomitant with substantial chromatin reorganization. Histone post-translational modification studies using both Western blots and isotope labeling assisted quantitative mass spectrometry analyses reveal that substantial histone modification changes, particularly H3K18(AC) and H3K23(AC), are associated with the removal and regeneration of the cell wall. Label-free quantitative proteome analyses further reveal that chromatin associated proteins undergo dramatic changes upon removal of the cell wall, along with cytoskeleton, cell wall metabolism, and stress-response proteins.

20954713,"Molinate is a thiocarbamate herbicide used as a pre-emergent in rice patty fields. It has two predominant sulfoxidation metabolites, molinate sulfoxide and molinate sulfone. Previous work demonstrated an in vivo decrease in liver aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in rats treated with molinate and motor function deficits in dogs dosed chronically with this compound. ALDH is an enzyme important in the catabolism of many neurotransmitters, such as dopamine. Inhibition of this enzyme may lead to the accumulation of endogenous neurotoxic metabolites such as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, a dopamine metabolite, which may account for the observed neurotoxicity. In this study, the relative reactivity of molinate and both of its sulfoxidation metabolites toward ALDH was investigated, as well as the mechanism of inhibition. The ALDH activity was monitored in two different model systems, human recombinant ALDH (hALDH2) and mouse striatal synaptosomes.

20951862,"The development of a reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence method for the determination of the mycotoxins fumonisin B(1) and fumonisin B(2) by using silica-based monolithic column is described. The samples were first extracted using acetonitrile:water (50:50, v/v) and purified by using a C(18) solid phase extraction-based clean-up column. Then, pre-column derivatization for the analyte using ortho-phthaldialdehyde in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol was carried out. The developed method involved optimization of mobile phase composition using methanol and phosphate buffer, injection volume, temperature and flow rate. The liquid chromatographic separation was performed using a reversed phase Chromolith(®) RP-18e column (100 mm × 4.6 mm) at 30 °C and eluted with a mobile phase of a mixture of methanol and phosphate buffer pH 3.35 (78:22, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min(-1). The fumonisins separation was achieved in about 4 min, compared to approximately 20 min by using a C(18) particle-packed column. The fluorescence excitation and emission were at 335 nm and 440 nm, respectively. The limits of detections were 0.01-0.04 μg g(-1) fumonisin B(1) and fumonisin B(2), respectively. Good recoveries were found for spiked samples (0.1, 0.5, 1.5 μg g(-1) fumonisins B(1) and B(2)), ranging from 84.0 to 106.0% for fumonisin B(1) and from 81.0 to 103.0% for fumonisin B(2).

The concentration of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in the caryopsis decreased progressively with its development, whereas inorganic As concentration remained stable. The ratios of As content between neighboring leaves or between neighboring internodes were c. 0.6. SXRF revealed As accumulation in the center of the caryopsis during its early development and then in the ovular vascular trace. • These results indicate that there are different controls on the unloading of inorganic As and DMA; the latter accumulated mainly in the caryopsis before flowering, whereas inorganic As was mainly transported into the caryopsis during grain filling.

Imaging mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI-IMS) is a suitable tool for investigating the localization and composition of metabolites; however, suitable methodologies for the MALDI-IMS analysis of rice have not yet been established.

Biofortification of major staple crops (wheat [Triticum aestivum], rice [Oryza sativa], maize [Zea mays], and potato [Solanum tuberosum]) with β-carotene has the potential to alleviate this nutritional problem. Previously, we engineered transgenic ""Golden"" potato tubers overexpressing three bacterial genes for β-carotene synthesis (CrtB, CrtI, and CrtY, encoding phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, and lycopene β-cyclase, respectively) and accumulating the highest amount of β-carotene in the four aforementioned crops. Here, we report the systematic quantitation of carotenoid metabolites and transcripts in 24 lines carrying six different transgene combinations under the control of the 35S and Patatin (Pat) promoters. Low levels of B-I expression are sufficient for interfering with leaf carotenogenesis, but not for β-carotene accumulation in tubers and calli, which requires high expression levels of all three genes under the control of the Pat promoter. Tubers expressing the B-I transgenes show large perturbations in the transcription of endogenous carotenoid genes, with only minor changes in carotenoid content, while the opposite phenotype (low levels of transcriptional perturbation and high carotenoid levels) is observed in Golden (Y-B-I) tubers. We used hierarchical clustering and pairwise correlation analysis, together with a new method for network correlation analysis, developed for this purpose, to assess the perturbations in transcript and metabolite levels in transgenic leaves and tubers.

An analytical method employing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)--inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) following enzymatic hydrolysis was developed to analyze the speciation of MeHg in uncooked and cooked white rice grain grown from the vicinity of a Hg mine in China. The results revealed that the MeHg in the uncooked rice is present almost exclusively as CH3Hg-L-cysteinate (CH3HgCys), a complex that is thought to be responsible for the transfer of MeHg across the blood-brain and placental barriers. Although cooking does not change the total Hg or total MeHg concentration in rice, no CH3HgCys is measurable after cooking, suggesting that most, if not all, of the CH3HgCys is converted to other forms of MeHg, the identity and toxicity of which remain elusive.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D003296', 'D004781', 'D006361', 'D008628', 'D008767', 'D008906', 'D012275', 'D012989']","['Cooking', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Heating', 'Mercury', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Mining', 'Oryza', 'Soil Pollutants']",Speciation of methylmercury in rice grown from a mercury mining area.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20656392,2011
20639576,"The GH3 family of acyl-acid-amido synthetases catalyze the ATP-dependent formation of amino acid conjugates to modulate levels of active plant hormones, including auxins and jasmonates. Initial biochemical studies of various GH3s show that these enzymes group into three families based on sequence relationships and acyl-acid substrate preference (I, jasmonate-conjugating; II, auxin- and salicylic acid-conjugating; III, benzoate-conjugating); however, little is known about the kinetic and chemical mechanisms of these enzymes. Here we use GH3-8 from Oryza sativa (rice; OsGH3-8), which functions as an indole-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase, for detailed mechanistic studies. Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that the OsGH3-8 requires either Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) for maximal activity and is specific for aspartate but accepts asparagine as a substrate with a 45-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency and accepts other auxin analogs, including phenyl-acetic acid, indole butyric acid, and naphthalene-acetic acid, as acyl-acid substrates with 1.4-9-fold reductions in k(cat)/K(m) relative to IAA. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies indicate that the enzyme uses a Bi Uni Uni Bi Ping Pong reaction sequence. In the first half-reaction, ATP binds first followed by IAA. Next, formation of an adenylated IAA intermediate results in release of pyrophosphate.

20638702,"Arsenic (As) induced identifiable health outcomes are now spreading across Indian subcontinent with continuous discovery of high As concentrations in groundwater. This study deals with groundwater hydrochemistry vis-à-vis As exposure assessment among rural population in Chakdaha block, West Bengal, India. The water quality survey reveals that 96% of the tubewells exceed WHO guideline value (10 μg/L of As). The groundwaters are generally anoxic (-283 to -22 mV) with circum-neutral pH (6.3 to 7.8). The hydrochemistry is dominated by HCO(3)(-) (208 to 440 mg/L), Ca(2+) (79 to 178 mg/L) and Mg(2+) (17 to 45 mg/L) ions along with high concentrations of As(T) (As total, below detection limit to 0.29 mg/L), Fe(T) (Fe total, 1.2 to 16 mg/L), and Fe(II) (0.74 to 16 mg/L). The result demonstrates that Fe(II)-Fe(III) cycling is the dominant process for the release of As from aquifer sediments to groundwater (and vice versa), which is mainly controlled by the local biogeochemical conditions. The exposure scenario reveals that the consumption of groundwater and rice are the major pathways of As accumulation in human body, which is explained by the dietary habit of the surveyed population.

The purpose of our research was to isolate and fully characterize peptide(s) derived from rice bran having anti-cancer properties. Gastrointestinal juices resistant peptide fractions were initially generated from heat stabilized de-fatted rice bran from which <5 kDa fraction was shown to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells. Based on these published findings the <5 kDa peptide fraction was selected for further characterization to obtain single pure peptide(s) with enhanced anti-cancer properties. Purification and characterization from the fraction was done employing chromatography and mass spectrometric techniques. Cancer cell viability was measured using a cell titer assay that uses a tetrazolium dye [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; (MTS)] and the electron coupling reagent, phenazine methosulfate. Ion-exchange chromatography elutes that showed anti-cancer properties were further purified to liberate pure peptide. The pure peptide at 600-700 microg/mL dose caused 84% inhibition to colon cancer cells (Caco-2, HCT-116) growth, 80% to breast cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) growth and 84% to liver cancer cells (HepG-2) growth. Mass spectrometry analysis and de novo sequencing revealed the sequence of Glu-Gln-Arg-Pro-Arg for the peptide with a molecular mass of 685.378 Da.

The proposed method makes use of a modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rigged, and safe) procedure that combines isolation of the pesticides and sample clean-up in a single step. Analysis is performed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, acquiring two specific precursor-product ion transitions per target compound. Two main fragment ions for each pesticide were obtained to achieve the identification according to the SANCO guidelines 10684/2009. The method was validated with various food samples, including edible oil, meat, egg, cheese, chocolate, coffee, rice, tree nuts, citric fruits, vegetables, etc. No significant matrix effect was observed for tested pesticides, therefore, matrix-matched calibration was not necessary. Calibration curves were linear and covered from 1 to 20 microg L(-1) for all compounds studied. The average recoveries, measured at 10 microg kg(-1), were in the range 70-120% for all of the compounds tested with relative standard deviations below 20%, while a value of 10 microg kg(-1) has been established as the method limit of quantitation (MLOQ) for all target analytes. Similar trueness and precision results were also obtained for spiking at 200 microg kg(-1). Expanded uncertainty values were in the range 21-27% while the HorRat ratios were below 1.

Brachypodium distachyon has been proposed as a new model plant to study temperate cereals. The protein composition of Brachypodium grain was investigated by separating the proteins on the basis of their solubility combined with a proteomic approach. Salt-soluble proteins as well as salt-insoluble proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed 284 and 120 spots, respectively. Proteins from the major spots were sequenced by mass spectrometry and identified by searching against a Brachypodium putative protein database. Our analysis detected globulins and prolamins but no albumins. Globulins were represented mainly by the 11S type and their solubility properties corresponded to the glutelin found in rice. An in silico search for storage proteins returned more translated genes than expressed products identified by mass spectrometry, particularly in the case of prolamin type proteins, reflecting a strong expression of globulins at the expense of prolamins. Microscopic examination of endosperm cells revealed scarce small-size starch granules surrounded by protein bodies containing 11S globulins.

So far, no analytical method has been available for the simultaneous determination of most rice pesticides in rice grains. This paper reports the development and validation of such a method for the determination of eight rice pesticides (penoxsulam tricyclazole, propanil, azoxystrobin, molinate, profoxydim, cyhalofop-butyl, deltamethrin) and 3,4-dichloroaniline, the main metabolite of propanil. Pesticide extraction and clean-up was performed by an optimized matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) protocol on neutral alumina (5 g) using acetonitrile as the elution solvent. Samples were analyzed in a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) system. Pesticide separation was achieved with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water in a linear elution gradient from 30:70% (v/v) to 100:0% (v/v) in 14 min at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min(-1). Method validation was performed by means of linearity, intra-day accuracy, inter-day precision and sensitivity. Linear regression coefficients (R(2)) were always above 0.9948. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) varied from 0.002 to 0.200 mg kg(-1) and 0.006 to 0.600 mg kg(-1), respectively. Recoveries were investigated at three fortification levels and were found to be acceptable (74-127%) with relative standard deviations (RSD) below 12%.

Compounds have been selected from different chemical families including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and acaricides. Three isotopically labeled standards have been used as surrogates in order to improve accurate quantitation. Samples were extracted by using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) with ethyl acetate. In the case of spinach, an additional clean-up step by gel permeation chromatography was applied. Determination was performed by GC-MS/MS in electron ionization mode acquiring two MS/MS transitions for each analyte. The intensity ratio between quantitation transition (Q) and identification transition (q) was used as confirmatory parameter (Q/q ratio). Accuracy and precision were evaluated by means of recovery experiments in orange, nectarine, and spinach samples spiked at two concentration levels (0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg). Recoveries were, in most cases, between 70% and 120% and RSD were below 20%. The limits of quantification objective for which the method was satisfactorily validated in the three samples matrices were for most pesticides 0.01 mg/kg. Matrix effects over the GC-MS/MS determination were tested by comparison of reference standards in pure solvent with matrix-matched standards of each matrix. Data obtained showed enhancement of signal for the majority of analytes in the three matrices investigated. Consequently, in order to reduce the systematic error due to this effect, quantification was performed using matrix-matched standard calibration curves.

Under these conditions, squalene was effectively concentrated to 25% with nearly quantitative recovery, and then a more highly concentrated squalene (ca. 50% purity) was obtained by using a supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) with silica gel packed into the extraction vessel. In addition, squalene with ca. 68% purity could be obtained by repeating the SFC twice. After the saponification of the deodorization distillate, followed by solvent fractionation with hexane, highly purified phytosterols (97% purity) could be obtained, and highly purified squalene (81% and 100% purity) could be also obtained by using SFC combined with the solvent fractionation technique for the unsaponifiable materials. Therefore, it is considered that the present fractionation method combined with SFC and solvent fractionation is an effective means of concentrating squalene and phytosterols.",Journal of oleo science,"['D025924', 'D010840', 'D010938', 'D000073879', 'D013185']","['Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid', 'Phytosterols', 'Plant Oils', 'Rice Bran Oil', 'Squalene']",Novel fractionation method for squalene and phytosterols contained in the deodorization distillate of rice bran oil.,"['Q000379', 'Q000302', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000302']","['methods', 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', None, 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20103978,2010
20102202,"Betaine and choline are important components of the one-carbon metabolism cycle, linked with the amino acid homocysteine and lipid metabolism. Analyses of broad ranges of foods point to cereal based foods being important sources of betaine and choline, however to date there has been no detailed analysis of these compounds in cereal flours or cereal products. An analytical method based on optimization of an existing extraction followed by LC-MS/MS analysis was used to analyze 47 plasma samples, 32 cereal flours and cereal fractions, and 51 cereal products. For the method validation LLOQ, recovery, inter- and intraday repeatability were all performed. Whole-grain wheat and rye flours, and products based on these were the best whole cereal sources of betaine (747-1508 microg/g) and to a lesser extent choline (76-159 microg/g), while the bran fraction contained the highest concentrations of betaine and free-choline (2350-2899 microg/g and 366-384 microg/g respectively). Refined wheat flour and products contained lower concentrations, while rice and maize contained only very low and no detectable amounts of betaine respectively (0-10 microg/g), and low amounts of free-choline (<31 microg/g). These results were mirrored in cereal products analyzed, with whole-grain wheat or rye-based cereal products having the highest concentrations of the two metabolites. Plasma concentrations for betaine and free-choline in a group of 47 subjects ranged from 15.2-66.3 and 9.8-18.5 micromol/L respectively, within the range of previous reports. This LC-MS/MS method can be used to rapidly and sensitively quantify betaine and free-choline in plasma and cereal products.

As cereulide poses a health risk to humans, the development of an appropriate method for the analysis of this toxin is mandatory. Therefore, the reference material of cereulide as well as its (13)C(6)-isotopologue was prepared by means of a biosynthetic approach using a B. cereus culture, followed by a rapid but efficient downstream purification. After structure confirmation by means of liquid chromatography (LC)-time-of-flight mass spectrometry, LC-tandem mass spectrometry, and one-/two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, a stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) was developed for the quantification of cereulide in foods using the (13)C(6)-cereulide as the internal standard. Validation experiments were performed, and the data were compared to the quantitative analysis using the structurally related valinomycin instead of the (13)C(6)-cereulide as an internal standard. Trueness, repeatability, and reproducibility expressed as relative standard deviation showed values <10 or <8% for valinomycin or <8% for (13)C(6)-cereulide, respectively. Furthermore, the MS response of the valinomycin was found to be significantly influenced by the food matrix, thus leading to rather low recovery rates of 91% from boiled rice and 80% from boiled rice supplemented with 10% sunflower oil. In comparison, the use of (13)C(6)-cereulide as an internal standard gave good recovery rates of 104 and 111% from both matrices, thus demonstrating the robustness and accuracy of the developed SIDA.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001409', 'D001427', 'D002247', 'D047630', 'D005506', 'D007553']","['Bacillus cereus', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Depsipeptides', 'Food Contamination', 'Isotope Labeling']",Development of a stable isotope dilution analysis for the quantification of the Bacillus cereus toxin cereulide in foods.,"['Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19994891,2010

The extent to which the contents of the analyzed elements varied with rice areas was rater for Cd and Se than for Zn, though the contents followed in the same order: polluted area > acid paddy area and neutral paddy area. This further evidenced a determinacy of chemical availability in rice Cd uptake. Taking the reference dose values by WHO and USEPA, the health risk by Cd exposure to the rice diet from different areas was estimated. The consumption of rice from polluted area and acid paddy area may impose serious health risks for subsistence diet farmers though those from neutral paddy area may be still safe under the WHO guideline.

Comparative genomics of maize, rice (Oryza sativa), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) sequences reveal differences in gene family structure between grass species and a reference eudicot species. Analysis of transcript profile data for cell wall genes in developing maize ovaries revealed that expression within families differed by up to 100-fold. When transcriptional analyses of developing ovaries before pollination from Arabidopsis, rice, and maize were contrasted, distinct sets of cell wall genes were expressed in grasses. These differences in gene family structure and expression between Arabidopsis and the grasses underscore the requirement for a grass-specific genetic model for functional analyses. A UniformMu population proved to be an important resource in both forward- and reverse-genetics approaches to identify hundreds of mutants in cell wall genes. A forward screen of field-grown lines by near-infrared spectroscopic screen of mature leaves yielded several dozen lines with heritable spectroscopic phenotypes. Pyrolysis-molecular beam mass spectrometry confirmed that several nir mutants had altered carbohydrate-lignin compositions.",Plant physiology,"['D017360', 'D050260', 'D002241', 'D002473', 'D004251', 'D035264', 'D020869', 'D018506', 'D017343', 'D053858', 'D008969', 'D005810', 'D016254', 'D009154', 'D009711', 'D012275', 'D010641', 'D020005', 'D013379', 'D003313']","['Arabidopsis', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cell Wall', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Flowers', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oryza', 'Phenotype', 'Propanols', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Zea mays']",Genetic resources for maize cell wall biology.,"['Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000096', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235', 'Q000166']","['genetics', 'genetics', 'biosynthesis', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'genetics', None, 'metabolism', 'genetics', 'cytology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19926802,2010

19891455,"An automated hydride generation (AHG) interface to inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICPMS) was developed for measuring arsenic in environmental samples. This technique provides statistically indistinguishable response slopes (within about 3%) for hydride generation-ICPMS (HG-ICPMS) analysis of all major As species, inorganic As(III), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and inorganic As(V); this has not previously been achieved. Previously, sample pretreatment to convert all forms of As into As(V) has been a prerequisite for measuring total arsenic in complex matrices. Under our operating conditions, arsenobetaine (AsB), until now regarded to be inert, also generates a hydride (albeit the response is only approximately 7% of others). The limit of detection (LOD) based on three times the standard deviation of the blank with this technique for AsB, DMA, As(III), MMA, and As(V) is 90, 66, 63, 63, and 63 pg As, respectively.

19883976,"A carbonaceous sorbent was prepared from rice husk via sulfuric acid treatment. Sorption of Zn(II) and Hg(II) from aqueous solution was studied varying time, pH, metal concentration, temperature and sorbent status (wet and dry). Zn(II) sorption was found fast reaching equilibrium within approximately 2h while Hg(II) sorption was slow reaching equilibrium within approximately 120 h with better performance for the wet sorbent than for the dry. Kinetics data for both metals were found to follow pseudo-second order model. Sorption rate of both metals was enhanced with temperature rise. Activation energy, E(a), for Zn(II) sorption, was approximately 13.0 kJ/mol indicating a diffusion-controlled process ion exchange process, however, for Hg(II) sorption, E(a) was approximately 54 kJ/mol indicating a chemically controlled process. Sorption of both metals was low at low pH and increased with pH increase. Sorption was much higher for Hg(II) than for Zn(II) with higher uptake for both metals by rising the temperature. Hg(II) was reduced to Hg(I) on the sorbent surface. This was confirmed from the identification of Hg(2)Cl(2) deposits on the sorbent surface by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction.

Samples were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet light (UV) detection after immunoaffinity clean-up. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were 2.2 and 5.6 µg kg(-1), respectively. Recoveries and repeatability expressed as coefficients of variation (CV) were 82.3-100% and 2.4-15.3% in beer, bread and dried corn.

24785173,"Rice generally contains higher levels of arsenic than most terrestrial-based foods. Studies related to dietary intake of arsenic from rice must take into account arsenic speciation due to toxicity differences in arsenic species. In this study, microwave-assisted extraction with trifluoroacetic acid was used to prepare rice samples for arsenic speciation analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Fifty-three samples collected directly from the fields in four major rice-producing states in 1980 and 1981 were analysed for total and speciated arsenic and the results were compared with each other and with results for several more recently collected samples from local markets. The average content of total arsenic was 210 ± 190 ng As g(-1). This study demonstrates that US rice samples with higher levels of total arsenic have higher levels of dimethylarsinic acid; however, inorganic arsenic levels, regardless of the total arsenic content, rarely exceed 150 ng As g(-1) dry weight. These data are consistent with more recent findings, thus establishing trends that arsenic content in US-grown rice has been relatively constant throughout the last 30 years. To the authors' knowledge, the presented data are unique in that they provide a historical reference point for arsenic distribution in US-produced rice. These data would be invaluable for several applications including long-term arsenic exposure studies, environmental clean-up assessments, and to establish models for future trends in arsenic contribution in total diet studies.

The ability of P. citreonigrum to produce citreoviridin was assessed, and a total of 420 samples of 21 different kinds of rice were collected. Mycobiota isolation and identification, the ability of citreoviridin strains to produce toxin, and the natural occurrence of citreoviridin were established. Rice samples were found to have high fungal counts and showed increasing levels from 2004 to 2007 harvest years. The most frequent genus was Aspergillus followed by Penicillium and Cladosporium. Ten out of eleven strains of P. citreonigrum were able to produce citreoviridin. Three rice samples had levels of citreoviridin ranging from 12 to 96.7 ng g(-1), and two bran samples had levels of 128 and 254 ng g(-1).

19731713,"For up to 1 billion people worldwide, insufficient dietary intake of selenium (Se) is a serious health constraint. Cereals are the dominant Se source for those on low protein diets, as typified by the global malnourished population. With crop Se content constrained largely by underlying geology, regional soil Se variations are often mirrored by their locally grown staples. Despite this, the Se concentrations of much of the world's rice, the mainstay of so many, is poorly characterized, for both total Se content and Se speciation. In this study, 1092 samples of market sourced polished rice were obtained. The sampled rice encompassed dominant rice producing and exporting countries. Rice from the U.S. and India were found to be the most enriched, while mean average levels were lowest in Egyptian rice: approximately 32-fold less than their North American equivalents. By weighting country averages by contribution to either global production or export, modeled baseline values for both were produced.

A total of 29 food samples consisting of 12 rice and rice products, 5 wheat and wheat products, 5 grains and cereal based products and 7 different popular varieties of cooked rice and rice products were selected. The phytate content was analysed using anion-exchange chromatography whereas mineral contents were analysed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry(AAS). One-way ANOVA test was used to statistically analyse the mean difference between the phytate and mineral contents between the food group samples. In general, results show that cooked products have lower content of phytate and minerals as compared to raw products. This could be due to the influence of the cooking method on phytate and mineral content in the food. Based on one-way ANOVA test, there were no significant difference in phytate and zinc content between four food groups (p >0.05). Significant differences were found only in iron and calcium content (p <0.05). Of the 29 food samples, 25 food samples had a phytate/iron molar ratio > 1, 5 food samples had a phytate/zinc molar ratio > 15 and 23 food samples had a phytate/calcium molar ratio of 0.24.

19702755,"Nearly one-third of the world's population, mostly women and children, suffer from iron malnutrition and its consequences, such as anaemia or impaired mental development. Iron fortification of food is difficult because soluble iron is either unstable or unpalatable, and non-soluble iron is not bioavailable. Genetic engineering of crop plants to increase iron content has therefore emerged as an alternative for iron biofortification. To date, strategies to increase iron content have relied on single genes, with limited success. Our work focuses on rice as a model plant, because it feeds one-half of the world's population, including the majority of the iron-malnourished population. Using the targeted expression of two transgenes, nicotianamine synthase and ferritin, we increased the iron content of rice endosperm by more than six-fold. Analysis of transgenic rice lines confirmed that, in combination, they provide a synergistic effect on iron uptake and storage. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry showed that the iron in the endosperm of the transgenic rice lines accumulated in spots, most probably as a consequence of spatially restricted ferritin accumulation. Agronomic evaluation of the high-iron rice lines did not reveal a yield penalty or significant changes in trait characters, except for a tendency to earlier flowering. Overall, we have demonstrated that rice can be engineered with a small number of genes to achieve iron biofortification at a dietary significant level.",Plant biotechnology journal,"['D019883', 'D005293', 'D007501', 'D012275', 'D030821', 'D012639']","['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases', 'Ferritins', 'Iron', 'Oryza', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Seeds']",Rice endosperm iron biofortification by targeted and synergistic action of nicotianamine synthase and ferritin.,"['Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', 'Q000201', 'Q000201', 'Q000235']","['genetics', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'enzymology', 'enzymology', 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19702755,2009

While many studies have been done, relatively little is known about RBPs in plants. As part of our continuing efforts to understand cytoplasmic gene expression events in developing rice seed (Oryza sativa L.), a proteomics approach was used to identify cytoplasmic-localized, cytoskeletal-associated RBPs. The nucleic acid binding fraction from a cytoskeletal-enriched rice seed extract was isolated by Poly(U)-Sepharose affinity chromatography and analyzed using 2D gel electrophoresis. Analysis of 162 excised protein spots using mass spectrometry led to the identification of 148 distinct proteins, in addition to the highly abundant globulin and glutelin seed storage proteins. Identified proteins include those involved in RNA processing, translation, protein modification, cell signaling, and metabolism, as well as a number of hypothetical proteins.

Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) was used as a template molecule. A molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedure was developed for further application in the analysis of FB. The performance of the MIP throughout the clean-up of spiked bell pepper, rice and corn flake sample extracts was compared with the results obtained when using non-imprinted polymer, C(18), strong anion exchange and immunoaffinity sorbents. Extracts were analysed for FB with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after clean-up. Depending on the food matrix and the concentration range of the fumonisins, recoveries after MISPE varied from 62 to 86%, from 62 to 83%, and from 67 to 81% for fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)), fumonisin B(2) (FB(2)) and fumonisin B(3) (FB(3)), respectively. The selectivity of the synthesized MIP for mycotoxins belonging to the group of FB was confirmed by evaluating cross-reactivity from analogue structures and other mycotoxins. Analysis of 39 naturally contaminated samples (corn flakes) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry indicated that the synthesized MIP could be an excellent alternative for clean-up and pre-concentration of FB in food samples. Pearson correlations between immunoaffinity clean-up and MISPE were calculated and amounted to 0.923 for FB(1), 0.808 for FB(2), and 0.759 for FB(3). It was shown that the developed MIP could be reused more than 50 times.

The main objective was to study the mould and mycotoxin content in basmati rice and rice with a high content of fibre. Samples of jasmine rice as well as long-grain rice were also included. The samples were analysed for their content of ochratoxin A (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)), aflatoxin B(1), B(2), G(1), and G(2) (HPLC, RIDA(R)QUICK), and mould (traditional cultivation methods in combination with morphological analysis). The majority of samples were sampled according to European Commission Regulation 401/2006. Subsamples were pooled and mixed before milling and both mould and mycotoxin analyses were performed on milled rice. The results showed that the majority of basmati rice (71%) and many jasmine rice samples (20%) contained detectable levels of aflatoxin B(1) (level of quantification = 0.1 microg aflatoxin kg(-1) rice). Two samples of jasmine rice and ten basmati rice samples contained levels over the regulated European maximum limits of 2 microg kg(-1) for aflatoxin B(1) or 4 microg kg(-1) for total aflatoxins. Aspergillus was the most common mould genus isolated, but also Penicillium, Eurotium, Wallemia, Cladosporium, Epicoccum, Alternaria, and Trichotecium were found. The presence of Aspergillus flavus in 21% of the samples indicates that incorrect management of rice during production and storage implies a risk of mould growth and subsequent production of aflatoxin. Rough estimates showed that high rice consumers may have an intake of 2-3 ng aflatoxin kg(-1) bodyweight and day(-1) from rice alone.

Concentrations of OP pesticides were determined by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection (GC-FPD). The results showed that 9.3% of the samples contained detectable residues of at least one of the seven target OP pesticides (chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, omethoate, methamidophos, parathion-methyl, parathion and triazophos) mainly used for agriculture in China, with concentrations ranging 0.011-1.756 mg kg(-1).

Relative potency factors (RPFs) for each pesticide were calculated with methamidophos as the index compound (IC), using 1- or 2-year chronic non-observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) for AChE inhibition, mostly in rat brain, obtained from international evaluations of pesticides. Exposure to AChE-inhibiting pesticides for the population above 7 years old at P99.9 represented 52-94.5% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) expressed as methamidophos. Estimated exposure for children aged 2-4 and 4-7 years at P99.9 were 119 and 104.3% of the ADI level, respectively.

Iodine, at the equivalent of 25-65 mg of iodine per kg salt, was 100% retained in each of the selected foods from the time of mixing to the final product. These results imply that all iodine added via salt at the time of manufacture is available for consumption but not necessarily bioavailable.

The analytical results showed that 18 mineral elements (S, Mo, Ba, Ni, Fe, Cr, Na, Al, Cu, P, Sn, Zn, B, Mn, Mg, Ca, Sr and K) are the important active compositions of functional rice, and their mean contents in milled rice are in the order of P>K>S>Mg>Ca>Zn>Na>Al>Mn>Fe>Cu>B >Mo>Ni>Sn>Cr>Ba>Sr, in brown rice in the order of P>K>Mg>S>Ca>Zn>Mn>Al>Na>Fe>Cu>B>Mo>Sn> Ni>Cr>Ba>Sr, but in soil in the order of Fe>Al>Ca>K>Mg>P>S>Mn>B>Na>Ba>Zn>Cr>Cu>Ni>Sn>Mo> Sr; 16 mineral elements in milled and brown rice (except for S and P) are clearly lower than that in soils. The correlation of 8 microelements (Mo, Ni, Cr, Sr, Mn, Zn, Cu and Na) in milled and brown rice is closer than that of 6 macroelements (P, K, Mg, Ca, S and Al). There are rich Fe, Al and Ca in Yunnan soils, but 4 elements (P, K, Mg and S) are in high priority in milled and brown rice; The milled rice used for the staple is easier to place a premium on chronics than brown rice. The above results provided reliable data and theory bases for genetic breeding and production of functional rice, and for further solving the chronics and the malnourished problems with insufficient Fe, Zn and Ca for 4 billion people in the world.",Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu,"['D002681', 'D005511', 'D016014', 'D008903', 'D012275', 'D015203', 'D012987', 'D013054']","['China', 'Food Handling', 'Linear Models', 'Minerals', 'Oryza', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Soil', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",[Correlation of mineral elements between milled and brown rice and soils in Yunnan studied by ICP-AES].,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19650503,2010
19626338,"To study the mechanisms of exogenous NO contribution to alleviate the cadmium (Cd) toxicity in rice (Oryza sativa), rice plantlets subjected to 0.2-mM CdCl(2) exposure were treated with different concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor), and Cd toxicity was evaluated by the decreases in plant length, biomass production and chlorophyll content. The results indicated that 0.1 mM SNP alleviated Cd toxicity most obviously. Atomic absorption spectrometry and fluorescence localization showed that treatment with 0.1 mM SNP decreased Cd accumulation in both cell walls and soluble fraction of leaves, although treatment with 0.1 mM SNP increased Cd accumulation in the cell wall of rice roots obviously. Treatment with 0.1 mM SNP in nutrient solution had little effect on the transpiration rate of rice leaves, but this treatment increased pectin and hemicellulose content and decreased cellulose content significantly in the cell walls of rice roots. Based on these results, we conclude that decreased distribution of Cd in the soluble fraction of leaves and roots and increased distribution of Cd in the cell walls of roots are responsible for the NO-induced increase of Cd tolerance in rice. It seems that exogenous NO enhances Cd tolerance of rice by increasing pectin and hemicellulose content in the cell wall of roots, increasing Cd accumulation in root cell wall and decreasing Cd accumulation in soluble fraction of leaves.",Planta,"['D000222', 'D002104', 'D002473', 'D008856', 'D009569', 'D009599', 'D012275', 'D010368', 'D010788', 'D018517', 'D018520', 'D018526', 'D011134', 'D014018']","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Cadmium', 'Cell Wall', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitroprusside', 'Oryza', 'Pectins', 'Photosynthesis', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Shoots', 'Plant Transpiration', 'Polysaccharides', 'Tissue Distribution']",Exogenous nitric oxide enhances cadmium tolerance of rice by increasing pectin and hemicellulose contents in root cell wall.,"['Q000187', 'Q000633', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000494', 'Q000166', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000166', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000187']","['drug effects', 'toxicity', 'drug effects', None, 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', 'cytology', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'cytology', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19626338,2009

However, there are sporadic reports of fumonisin contamination in wheat worldwide. The rice adherent fungus Gibberella fujikuroi is taxonomically closely related to F. verticillioides. Therefore, the potential risk of fumonisin contamination in rice and wheat is significant. Previously, a sensitive detection method utilizing liquid chromatography with tandem electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS-MS) was developed for the determination of fumonisins in brown rice. In the present study, the incidence of fumonisins in brown rice and wheat harvested in Japan was investigated using LC-ESI-MS-MS. Forty-eight rice samples and 47 wheat samples were screened and analyzed for the major B-type fumonisins: fumonisin B1 (FB1) and fumonisin B2 (FB2). About 1 kg of rice or wheat seed was divided into three subsamples, and 10 g from each subsample was used for the analysis. The limits of detection were 0.012 and 0.011 mg/kg for FBt and FB2, respectively, in rice samples and 0.010 and 0.008 mg/kg for FB1 and FB2, respectively, in wheat samples. The mean (standard deviation) recoveries of FB1 spiked at 0.50 mg/kg into toxin-free rice and wheat samples were 77.6 (4.2)% and 84.5 (3.1)%, respectively.

Here, we investigated the speciation and localization of As and the distribution of (micro)nutrients in rice grains because these are key factors controlling bioavailability of nutrients and contaminants. Bulk total and speciation analyses using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) was complemented by spatially resolved microspectroscopic techniques (micro-XANES, micro-X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) and particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE)) to investigate both speciation and distribution of As and localization of nutrients in situ. The distribution of As and micronutrients varied between the various parts of the grains (husk, bran and endosperm) and was characterized by element-specific distribution patterns. The speciation of As in bran and endosperm was dominated by As(III)-thiol complexes. The results indicate that the translocation from the maternal to filial tissues may be a bottleneck for As accumulation in the grain.

19542298,"Pentavalent methylated arsenic (As) species such as monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V)] and dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V)] are used as herbicides or pesticides, and can also be synthesized by soil microorganisms or algae through As methylation. The mechanism of MMA(V) and DMA(V) uptake remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that arsenite is taken up by rice (Oryza sativa) roots through two silicon transporters, Lsi1 (the aquaporin NIP2;1) and Lsi2 (an efflux carrier). Here we investigated whether these two transporters also mediate the uptake of MMA(V) and DMA(V). MMA(V) was partly reduced to trivalent MMA(III) in rice roots, but only MMA(V) was translocated to shoots. DMA(V) was stable in plants. The rice lsi1 mutant lost about 80% and 50% of the uptake capacity for MMA(V) and DMA(V), respectively, compared with the wild-type rice, whereas Lsi2 mutation had little effect. The short-term uptake kinetics of MMA(V) can be described by a Michaelis-Menten plus linear model, with the wild type having 3.5-fold higher V(max) than the lsi1 mutant. The uptake kinetics of DMA(V) were linear with the slope being 2.8-fold higher in the wild type than the lsi1 mutant. Heterologous expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increased the uptake of MMA(V) but not DMA(V), possibly because of a very limited uptake of the latter. Uptake of MMA(V) and DMA(V) by wild-type rice was increased as the pH of the medium decreased, consistent with an increasing proportion of the undissociated species. The results demonstrate that Lsi1 mediates the uptake of undissociated methylated As in rice roots.",Plant physiology,"['D000818', 'D020346', 'D001151', 'D001152', 'D001692', 'D002101', 'D002851', 'D003470', 'D006863', 'D007700', 'D013058', 'D008745', 'D008969', 'D009154', 'D009865', 'D012275', 'D010940', 'D018517', 'D018520', 'D012996', 'D014982']","['Animals', 'Aquaporins', 'Arsenic', 'Arsenicals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cacodylic Acid', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Culture Media', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oocytes', 'Oryza', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Shoots', 'Solutions', 'Xenopus laevis']",The rice aquaporin Lsi1 mediates uptake of methylated arsenic species.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000302', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, None]","[None, 'metabolism', 'isolation & purification', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, None, 'drug effects', None, None, 'drug effects', None, 'genetics', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19542298,2009

Satisfactory recoveries were obtained (70-110%) and precision (expressed as relative standard deviation) was typically below 15% with very few exceptions.

For validation of the detection procedure, linearity, accuracy, precision, detection limit, and quantification limit were determined. The validated detection method was then used to survey fumonisins in white rice, brown rice, barley, barley tea, beer, wheat flour, millet, dried corn, corn flour, corn tea, canned corn, popcorn, and breakfast cereal. Retention times for FB1 and FB2 standards were 7 and 18 min, respectively. Linearity (R2 = 0.99995 to 0.99998), accuracy (81.47 to 108.83%), precision (2.35 to 5.77), detection limit (25 ng/g or ng/ml), and quantification limit (37 ng/g or ng/ml) indicated that this procedure is capable of quantifying fumonisins in agricultural products. Only FB1-positive samples (5.12%, three dried corn samples and five corn flour samples) were found at 90.89 to 439.67 ng/g. According the survey results, an estimated daily intake of FB1 and FB2 in Korea was 0.087 ng/kg of body weight per day.

Arsenic toxicity and mobility are a function of its chemical-speciation. The distribution and identification of As in the rice plant are hence necessary to determine the uptake, transformation and potential risk posed by As contaminated rice. In this study we report on the distribution and chemical-speciation of As in rice (Oryza sativa Quest) by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements of rice plants grown in As contaminated paddy water. Investigations of muXRF images from rice tissues found that As was present in all rice tissues, and its presence correlated with the presence of iron at the root surface and copper in the rice leaf.

Ninety percent of the spots were common between the very distantly related cultivars 'Opata 85' and 'Synthetic W7984', the two parents of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) progeny. 'Opata' had 130 specific spots while 'Synthetic' had 96. 2DE and image analysis of the soluble proteins present in 112 recombinant inbred lines of the F9-mapped ITMI progeny enabled 120 unbiased segregating spots to be mapped on 21 wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em.

Six anthocyanin pigments were identified and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography using photo diode-array detection (HPLC-PDA) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry [LC-(ESI)MS/MS]. The predominant anthocyanins are cyanidin-3-glucoside (572.47 microg/g; 91.13% of total) and peonidin-3-glucoside (29.78 microg/g; 4.74% of total). Minor constituents included three cyanidin-dihexoside isomers and one cyanidin hexoside. Thermal stability of anthocyanins was assessed in rice cooked using a rice cooker, pressure cooker, or on a gas range. All cooking methods caused significant (P < 0.001) decreases in the anthocyanins identified. Pressure cooking resulted in the greatest loss of cyanidin-3-glucoside (79.8%) followed by the rice cooker (74.2%) and gas range (65.4%).

A method that is simple, faster, and more cost-effective than the environmental protection agency (EPA) method has been developed for the analysis of 82 frequently used pesticides in water samples obtained from Yeongsan and Sumjin rivers, as well as rice fields located in various locations around the two rivers. The samples were extracted by dichloromethane, and the pesticides were analyzed using a GC-electron capture detector (ECD), followed by confirmation with GC-MS. Recoveries were found to be between 82 and 120.1% for most of the tested pesticides, which were in agreement with the standard values dictated by the EPA. The method was potentially applied to 66 water samples for human consumption and 90 water samples from the rice fields and irrigation ditches that were collected from June to September 2007. Oxadiazon, butachlor, and alachlor were detected in some of the river water samples collected in June, iprobenfos (IBP) was detected in samples collected in August, and no pesticide was detected in September. On the other hand, chlorpyrifos-methyl, IBP, hexaconazole, diazinon, oxadiazon, butachlor, and isoprothiolane were detected at relatively high concentrations in 48 rice paddy field water samples collected between June and September 2007. Alachlor in one sample and procymidone in some of the rice paddy field water samples were also detected in trace amounts.

19212951,"Rice is a critically important food crop plant on our planet. It is also an excellent model plant for cereal crops, and now in position to serve as a reference plant for biofuel production. Proteomics study of rice therefore is crucial to better understand ""rice"" as a whole. Rice proteomics has moved well beyond the initial proteome analysis in the early to late 1990s. Since the year 2000, numerous proteomic studies have been performed in rice during growth and development and against a wide variety of environmental factors. These proteomic investigations have established the high-resolution 2-D reference gels of rice tissues, organs, and organelle under normal and adverse (stressed) conditions by optimizing suitable, reproducible systems for gel, and MS-based proteomic techniques, which ""rejuvenated"" the rice proteome field. This constituted the ""phase I"" in rice proteomics, and resulted in rice being labeled as the ""cornerstone"" of cereal food crop proteomes. Now, we are in position to state that rice proteomics today marks the ""beginning of phase II"". This is due to the fact that rice researchers are capable of digging deeper into the rice proteome, mapping PTMs (in particular reversible protein phosphorylation), performing inter- and intra-species comparisons, integrating proteomics data with other ""omic"" technologies-generated data, and probing the functional aspect of individual proteins.

This study was aimed to develop prediction models for sensory descriptors based on the volatile components derived from the gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) that would be useful to help select rice cultivars containing a satisfactory flavor to produce improved quality in rice breeding programs. Thirteen Korean specialty rice samples were evaluated for their flavor components using descriptive analysis and GC-O. Nineteen aroma attributes in cooked specialty rice samples were evaluated by 8 trained panelists and statistically correlated to the concentration of aroma-active compounds derived from GC-O analysis. Prediction models were developed for most aroma descriptors including popcorn, cooked grain, starchy, woody, smoky, grain, corn, hay-like, barny, rancid, waxy, earthy, and sweet aroma using stepwise multiple linear regression.

The highest concentrations of As, Hg, and Pb (raw and cooked samples) were mainly found in fish, with a clear tendency, in general, to increase metal concentrations after cooking. However, in these samples, Cd levels were very close to their detection limit. In turn, the concentrations of metals in raw and cooked meat samples were detected in all samples (As) or only in a very few samples (Cd, Hg, and Pb). A similar finding corresponded to string beans, rice, and olive oil, while in potatoes, Hg could not be detected and Pb only was detected in the raw samples.

It was based on solid phase extraction of copper(II) ions on a minicolumn of Amberlite XAD-2 loaded with 2-(2-thiazolylazo)-5-dimethylaminophenol (TAM). The optimisation process was carried out using Doehlert designs. Four variables (sampling flow rate, SR; elution flow rate, buffer concentration, BC; and pH) were regarded as factors in the optimisation. The parameter ""sensitivity efficiency (SE)"" proposed in this paper, and defined as the analytical signal obtained for an on-line enrichment system for a preconcentration time of 1 min was used as analytical response in the optimisation process. Using the established experimental conditions, the proposed on-line system allowed determination of copper with detection limit (3sigma/S) of 0.23 mug l(-1), and a precision (repeatability), calculated as relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 3.9 and 3.7% for copper concentration of 5.00 and 20.00 mug l(-1), respectively. The preconcentration factor obtained is 62. The recovery achieved for copper determination in presence of several cations demonstrated that this has enough selectivity for analysis of food samples. The robustness of the proposed system was also evaluated.

18936055,"Increasing evidence suggests that proteins present in the angiosperm sieve tube system play an important role in the long distance signaling system of plants. To identify the nature of these putatively non-cell-autonomous proteins, we adopted a large scale proteomics approach to analyze pumpkin phloem exudates. Phloem proteins were fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography using both anion and cation exchange columns and then either in-solution or in-gel digested following further separation by SDS-PAGE. A total of 345 LC-MS/MS data sets were analyzed using a combination of Mascot and X!Tandem against the NCBI non-redundant green plant database and an extensive Cucurbit maxima expressed sequence tag database. In this analysis, 1,209 different consensi were obtained of which 1,121 could be annotated from GenBank and BLAST search analyses against three plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, rice (Oryza sativa), and poplar (Populus trichocarpa). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses identified sets of phloem proteins that function in RNA binding, mRNA translation, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and macromolecular and vesicle trafficking. Our findings indicate that protein synthesis and turnover, processes that were thought to be absent in enucleate sieve elements, likely occur within the angiosperm phloem translocation stream. In addition, our GO analysis identified a set of phloem proteins that are associated with the GO term ""embryonic development ending in seed dormancy""; this finding raises the intriguing question as to whether the phloem may exert some level of control over seed development. The universal significance of the phloem proteome was highlighted by conservation of the phloem proteome in species as diverse as monocots (rice), eudicots (Arabidopsis and pumpkin), and trees (poplar).

The fungus also infects noncereal crops, such as potatoes and sugar beets, and the genetic relationships among barley, wheat, potato, and sugar beet isolates indicate high levels of similarity. However, little is known about the toxigenic potential of G. zeae isolates from potatoes and sugar beets. A total of 336 isolates of G. zeae from barley, wheat, potatoes, and sugar beets were collected and analyzed by TRI (trichothecene biosynthesis gene)-based PCR assays. To verify the TRI-based PCR detection of genetic markers by chemical analysis, 45 representative isolates were grown in rice cultures for 28 days and 15 trichothecenes and 2 zearalenone (ZEA) analogs were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. TRI-based PCR assays revealed that all isolates had the deoxynivalenol (DON) marker. The frequencies of isolates with the 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15-ADON) marker were higher than those of isolates with the 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-ADON) marker among isolates from all four crops. Fusarium head blight (FHB)-resistant wheat cultivars had little or no influence on the diversity of isolates associated with the 3-ADON and 15-ADON markers. However, the frequency of isolates with the 3-ADON marker among isolates from the Langdon, ND, sampling site was higher than those among isolates from the Carrington and Minot, ND, sites. In chemical analyses, DON, 3-ADON, 15-ADON, b-ZEA, and ZEA were detected. All isolates produced DON (1 to 782 microg/g) and ZEA (1 to 623 microg/g).

An inverse correlation was found between the protein, lipid, and some of the humification indices considered, suggesting that the humification theory is actually humic substances produced from simple-structured natural organic substrates. Weight-average molecular weight (Mw), number-average molecular weight (Mn), and the ratio Mw/Mn of dissolved organic matters at different stages of the process were measured by gel permeation chromatography. The results showed that Mn and Mw increased with reaction time from 352 to 17,191, and from 78,707 to 104,564, respectively. The ratio of Mn/Mw decreased from 223.3 to 6.1.

Rice (Oryza sativa) is an excellent model for studying grain filling because of its importance as a staple food and the available genome sequence database. Our observations showed that embryo differentiation and endosperm cellularization in developing rice seeds were completed approximately 6 d after flowering (DAF); thereafter, the immature seeds mainly underwent cell enlargement and reached the size of mature seeds at 12 DAF. Grain filling began at 6 DAF and lasted until 20 DAF. Dynamic proteomic analyses revealed 396 protein spots differentially expressed throughout eight sequential developmental stages from 6 to 20 DAF and determined 345 identities. These proteins were involved in different cellular and metabolic processes with a prominently functional skew toward metabolism (45%) and protein synthesis/destination (20%). Expression analyses of protein groups associated with different functional categories/subcategories showed that substantially up-regulated proteins were involved in starch synthesis and alcoholic fermentation, whereas the down-regulated proteins in the process were involved in central carbon metabolism and most of the other functional categories/subcategories such as cell growth/division, protein synthesis, proteolysis, and signal transduction.

First, a national market basket survey (n = 240) was conducted in provincial capitals, sourcing grain from China's premier rice production areas. Second, to reflect rural diets, paddy rice (n = 195) directly from farmers fields were collected from three regions in Hunan, a key rice producing province located in southern China. Two of the sites were within mining and smeltery districts, and the third was devoid of large-scale metal processing industries. Arsenic levels were determined in all the samples while a subset (n = 33) were characterized for As species, using a new simple and rapid extraction method suitable for use with Hamilton PRP-X100 anion exchange columns and HPLC-ICP-MS.

In this study, the purified alcohol-soluble, non-reduced protein (prolamin) fraction from rice seed was investigated for the occurrence of O-linked oligosaccharides. As storage prolamins are unlikely to be O-glycosylated, any O-glycosylation found was likely to belong to co-extracted proteins, whether because of association with the protein body or solubility. SDS-PAGE and MS analyses revealed 14 and 16kDa protein families in fractions that bound to the lectins peanut agglutinin (PNA), Vicia villosa lectin (VVL) and Jacalin, indicative of the presence of O-linked saccharides. Enzymatic cleavage, fluorescent labeling and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis demonstrated a peak consistent with Gal-beta-(1-->3)-GalNAc, with similar MS/MS fragmentation. Additionally, upon chemical analysis, a GlcNAc-containing O-linked carbohydrate moiety was discovered. Protein blotting with anti-O-GlcNAc antibody (clone CTD110.6) was positive in a subpopulation of the 14kDa alcohol-soluble protein fraction, but a hot capping experiment was negative. Therefore, the GlcNAc residue in this case is unlikely to be terminal. Additionally, a positive reaction with CTD110.6mAb cannot be taken as absolute proof of O-GlcNAc modification and further confirmatory experiments should be employed. We hypothesize that O-glycosylation may contribute to protein functionality or regulation. Further investigation is required to identify the specific proteins with these modifications.

18620402,"Among cereals, only maize has not only a high amount of carotenoids, tocopherols, and oil content but also is rich in starch and protein content compared with other major food crops, such as rice and wheat. The present investigation was made primarily to assess the genetic variability for nutritionally important traits in 87 elite maize inbreds representing major heterotic groups in China. Carotenoid and tocopherol fractions were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), whereas oil, starch, and protein contents were detected by a VECTER22/N near-infrared analyzer. Significant interactions between genotypes and years were observed for all the traits. The pooled mean values of beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and total carotenoids were 0.449, 0.876, 0.121, 5.803, 3.048, and 10.298 microg g (-1), respectively, whereas the combined mean performance of alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, and total tocopherols were 23.98, 32.90, 2.189, and 59.55 microg g (-1), respectively. The average protein, starch, and oil contents were observed to be 12.28, 64.51, and 3.55%, respectively. High level of heritability estimates were observed for all the traits and ranged from 65.6% (protein content) to 92.5% (alpha/gamma-tocopherol ratio). Most of the traits studied in this experiment were either significantly positive correlated or independent. The present finding exhibits substantial opportunities to the breeders for improvement of these traits in maize cultivars and also suggests further exploration of a new source of elite breeding stocks containing a high level of these nutritionally important compounds.

18608510,"A monoclonal antibody against zearalenone (ZEA) was produced and used successfully to develop a direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DC-ELISA) for the analysis of ZEA in cereals. This DC-ELISA had a limit of detection of 0.15 +/- 0.02 microg l(-1) and an IC50 value of 1.13 +/- 0.16 microg l(-1). Matrix interference was minimized by dilution of the sample extract before ELISA assays. Aqueous methanol (80%) gave good extraction efficiencies, and the recovery from spiked rice, barley, and corn samples averaged between 87 and 112%. Although ZEA was detected in seven (9%) of 80 rice samples and in eight (16%) of 50 barley samples, the concentration of ZEA in samples was around or below the limit of detection of DC-ELISA. Among 38 corn samples, ZEA was detected in nine (24%) samples in the range 41.0-909.8 microg kg(-1). Re-analysis of the ELISA-positive corn samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed that seven (18%) corn samples were positive. The ZEA results for corn showed very good agreement between DC-ELISA and a commercial AgraQant zearalenone kit (r2 = 0.98).

Ingestion of contaminated drinking water is not the only elevated source of arsenic to the diet. Irrigation of agricultural fields with arsenic-contaminated groundwater has led to arsenic build-up in soil, with subsequent elevation of arsenic in crops grown on these soils. About 50.7 and 11.2 kg of arsenic are withdrawn per year from 23 and 18 shallow tubewells, used for agricultural irrigation in the studied two districts Murshidabad and Nadia, respectively and deposited on lands throughout the year. Considerable higher amounts of arsenic are accumulated in paddy plants. Mean arsenic concentration in food categories is 107 microg/kg. Arsenic concentrations are high in cooked food and skin of the vegetables. Arsenic concentration in cooked rice increases with water arsenic concentration. About 70.2% of arsenic is recovered by using the analytical speciation extraction method. Inorganic arsenic and DMA contribute 89.5% and 10.5% of the total content of arsenic in food, respectively.

The analysis of the category and function of TCB stress inducible proteins showed that different kinds of responses were produced in rice roots and leaves, when rice seedlings were exposed to 5 mg/L TCB stress. Most responses are essential for rice defending the damage of TCB stress. These responses include detoxication of toxic substances, expression of pathogenesis-related proteins, synthesis of cell wall substances and secondary compounds, regulation of protein and amino acid metabolism, activation of methionine salvage pathway, and also include osmotic regulation and phytohormone metabolism. Comparing the TCB stress inducible proteins between the two cultivars, the beta-glucosidase and pathogenesis-related protein family 10 proteins were particularly induced by TCB stress in the roots of rice cultivar (Oryza sativa L.)

Ecotoxicological biotests performed on 0.1 microg L(-1) photoirradiated solutions of the herbicide give a border line toxicity situation comparable to that of the precursor and indicate that the herbicide is characterized by low persistence in the environment, as required. Its degradation, however, does not lead to mineralization but to the formation of products of comparable toxicity. To evaluate the matrix effects, the photodegradation of the herbicide is also studied in the presence of rice paddy waters: the process is slower than in ultrapure water but leads to the same products.

18546736,"Rice can contain a relatively high amount of arsenic (As). We evaluated total and inorganic As concentrations in 39 samples of different types of rice sold in Spain. The analyses were performed in raw rice and in rice cooked by boiling to dryness in water spiked with As(V) (0.1-1 microg mL(-1)). In raw rice, inorganic As represented 27-93% of total As: total As = 0.188 +/- 0.078 microg g(-1) dry weight (dw); inorganic As = 0.114 +/- 0.046 microg g(-1) dw. After cooking, the rice retained between 45% and 107% of the As(V) added to the cooking water, and the inorganic As concentrations ranged between 0.428 microg g(-1) dw (0.1 microg mL(-1) in the cooking water) and 3.89 microg g(-1) dw (1.0 microg microL(-1) in the cooking water). For raw rice, the inorganic As intake of the Spanish population (16 g raw rice/day) remains below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) proposed by the WHO (2.1 microg inorganic As/day/kg body weight). In rice cooked with water contaminated with As(V), this cereal intake is sufficient to attain the TDI.

Elution was by a linear gradient of propan-2-ol in an acidic phosphate buffer system containing 0.7 M NaCl (pH 2.4). Biotin was derivatized with 9-anthryldiazomethane (ADAM) to the fluorescent biotin-ADAM ester and a linear calibration line was obtained from 0 to 1.39 pmol with a detection limit of 69.5 fmol. Biotin was measured after hydrolysis in 2.25 M sulphuric acid for 1h at 120 degrees C and the recovery for biocytin was 65.7+/-2.53%, and hence a correction factor of 1.52 was used for the total biotin analysis. The recovery of added biotin from the serum was more than 98% using this correction factor of 1.52. Biotin was also measured in nutritional supplemental foods and foodstuffs, and we found that chicken egg yolk, ""natto"", rice bran, royal jelly, and dried yeast contained highest levels of biotin. Biotin was also found in ferments by Bacillus natto, yeast, and some acetic acid bacterium. Storage foods such as beans, nuts and eggs also contained abundant biotin. Biotin was also determined and replacement monitored in the serum of suspected biotinidase deficiency patients.

The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has established the provisional tolerable weekly intake level for As as an inorganic As (iAs) value, because iAs in food is much more toxic than organic As. In this study, we studied an acid based partial-digestion method for the complete extraction of arsenicals from rice. HPLC/ICP-MS was used to determine the concentration of iAs selectively. The conditions adopted to extract arsenicals from a 0.5 g of finely ground rice sample were addition of 2 mL of 0.15 mol/L nitric acid and heating at 80 degrees C for 2 hr. The LOD and LOQ for iAs were 0.0024 and 0.0079 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Recovery studies showed good accuracy. When the method was applied to ten short-grain brown rice samples, the iAs concentrations were 0.108-0.227 mg/kg dry weight and the total As concentrations were 0.118-0.260 mg/kg dry weight.

In a first experiment, rice was inoculated with three strains of F. poae and three strains of F. avenaceum. In a second experiment, the same strains were cultivated on four different cereal substrates. For both experiments, the colonised substrates were analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) for the content of Fusarium mycotoxins. On rice, a strong effect of strains on mycotoxin content was found. With the analyses of different cereal types, substantial substrate effects were observed. For F. poae, these effects were highly dependent on the strain. The results of this study are of benefit for risk assessment concerning naturally infected grain samples since substrate effects could also be triggered by different cereal species or varieties, and thus could lead to variable mycotoxin contamination in cereal products intended for human consumption.","Food additives & contaminants.

Samples ( n = 16 each dose) were selected randomly for the calibration set, and the remaining 36 samples ( n = 4 each dose) were selected for the prediction set. Partial least-squares (PLS) analysis and least-squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) were implemented for calibration models. PLS analysis was implemented for calibration models with different wavelength bands including near-infrared (NIR) regions and mid-infrared (MIR) regions. The best PLS models were achieved in the MIR (400-4000 cm (-1)) region. Furthermore, different latent variables (5-9 LVs) were used as inputs of LS-SVM to develop the LV-LS-SVM models with a grid search technique and radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The optimal models were achieved with six LVs, and they outperformed PLS models. Moreover, independent component analysis (ICA) was executed to select several SWs based on loading weights. The optimal LS-SVM model was achieved with SWs (756, 895, 1140, and 2980 cm (-1)) selected by ICA and had better performance than PLS and LV-LS-SVM with the parameters of correlation coefficient ( r), root-mean-square error of prediction, and bias of 0.996, 80.260, and 5.172 x 10 (-4), respectively.

Here we present a large scale analysis by nanoLC-Q-TOF and nanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) of ten independent chloroplast preparations from Arabidopsis thaliana which unambiguously identified 1325 proteins. Novel proteins include various kinases and putative nucleotide binding proteins. Based on repeated and independent MS based protein identifications requiring multiple matched peptide sequences, as well as literature, 916 nuclear-encoded proteins were assigned with high confidence to the plastid, of which 86% had a predicted chloroplast transit peptide (cTP). The protein abundance of soluble stromal proteins was calculated from normalized spectral counts from LTQ-Obitrap analysis and was found to cover four orders of magnitude. Comparison to gel-based quantification demonstrates that 'spectral counting' can provide large scale protein quantification for Arabidopsis. This quantitative information was used to determine possible biases for protein targeting prediction by TargetP and also to understand the significance of protein contaminants. The abundance data for 550 stromal proteins was used to understand abundance of metabolic pathways and chloroplast processes. We highlight the abundance of 48 stromal proteins involved in post-translational proteome homeostasis (including aminopeptidases, proteases, deformylases, chaperones, protein sorting components) and discuss the biological implications. N-terminal modifications were identified for a subset of nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded proteins and a novel N-terminal acetylation motif was discovered. Analysis of cTPs and their cleavage sites of Arabidopsis chloroplast proteins, as well as their predicted rice homologues, identified new species-dependent features, which will facilitate improved subcellular localization prediction.

The LC/MS/MS method was based on the determination of four different peptide biomarkers selective for the Ara h2 and Ara h3/4 peanut proteins. The performance of this method was compared with that of a non-competitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method with ICP-MS detection of the metal used to tag the antibody for the quantitative peanut protein analysis in food. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantitation of the ICP-MS immunoassay were 2.2 and 5 microg peanuts g(-1) matrix, respectively, the recovery ranged from 86 +/- 18% to 110 +/- 4% and linearity was proved in the 5-50 microg g(-1) range. The LC/MS/MS method allowed us to obtain LODs of 1 and 5 microg protein g(-1) matrix for Ara h3/4 and Ara h2, respectively, thus obtaining significantly higher values with respect to the ELISA ICP-MS method, taking into account the different expression for concentrations. Linearity was established in the 10-200 microg g(-1) range of peanut proteins in the food matrix investigated and good precision (RSD <10%) was demonstrated.

The method uses matrix-matching, which involves the construction of a calibration curve on a blank (negative control) matrix, which is then used for the quantitation of melamine and by-products in adulterated (positive) samples. Matrix-matching compensates for analyte losses during sample preparation, and for matrix effects. The method was successfully applied to wheat, corn, and rice flours, and is expected to be applicable (with some modifications) to soy flour as well. The method allows for the detection of melamine, ammeline, and ammelide at approximately 5 microg g(-1), and cyanuric acid at approximately 90 microg g(-1) in wheat flour.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D002851', 'D002523', 'D005433', 'D005506', 'D014227']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Flour', 'Food Contamination', 'Triazines']","High-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous detection of the adulteration of cereal flours with melamine and related triazine by-products ammeline, ammelide, and cyanuric acid.","['Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18027188,2008
17973291,"We evaluated the suitability of high-throughput proteomic methods to monitor terrestrial ecosystems. Free-living Mus spretus from three sites along the ""Domingo Rubio"" (DR) stream were compared with mice from Doñana Biological Reserve (""Santa Olalla"" lagoon (SOL) negative control), using specimens from an industrial settlement (phosphogypsum stacks (PS)) and rice fields (""Matochal"" rice fields (ARZ)) as positive controls. Our 2-DE analysis showed 36 spots with significantly altered expression. Sixteen were identified by MALDI-TOF-PMF and peptide matching with Mus musculus databases. Identified proteins play different roles: cytoskeletal dynamics, proteolysis, biotransformation, oxidative-stress adaptation, and metabolism. Animals from different polluted environments showed contrasting differences in their proteomes, with specific increases and decreases in selected groups of proteins that seem to be co-ordinately regulated. Proteomic data were consistent with metal biomonitoring and conventional biomarker responses, indicating that DR (and PS/ARZ) animals sustained a heavier pollutant burden than SOL specimens and suffered a chronic oxidative stress. Whereas some protein expression differences may protect mice from pollutant toxicity, others should make them more susceptible. Transcript expression signatures agree with the documented lack of correlation between mRNA and protein levels. Nonetheless, a positive significant correlation was found between the gpx1 mRNA molecules and the intensity of one of the two identified GPX1 isospots.",Proteomics,"['D000818', 'D001151', 'D015415', 'D015153', 'D017753', 'D015180', 'D004784', 'D004787', 'D005260', 'D015870', 'D005843', 'D005979', 'D007668', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D019216', 'D051379', 'D011506', 'D020543', 'D040901', 'D012333', 'D015203', 'D012643', 'D013030', 'D019032']","['Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Biomarkers', 'Blotting, Western', 'Ecosystem', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Geography', 'Glutathione Peroxidase', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Mice', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Selenium', 'Spain', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Proteomics in free-living Mus spretus to monitor terrestrial ecosystems.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'genetics', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17973291,2008

17952775,"Although the accumulation of arsenic (As) in human blood is linked with some diseases and with occupational exposure, there are few reports on speciation of As in blood. On the basis of our earlier article, elevated level of arsenicals in human urine and blood were found in the ex-exposed population via As-containing drinking water. The aim of the present study was to get an insight on impact of As in foodstuffs on the people living in the As-affected areas. Moreover, speciation of arsenicals in urine, and water-samples found in arsenobetaine (AsB). Since sampling population (n=25) was not taking any seafood, As in foodstuffs was thought to be the prime source for this discrepancy. So, speciation of methanol extract of freeze-dried red blood cells (RBCs) and foodstuffs, and trichloro acetic acid (TCA) treated plasma by high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled argon plasma mass spectrometer (HPLC-ICP MS) collected from the study population (n=33) was carried out to support our hypothesis. Results showed that urine contained AsB (1.7%), arsenite (iAs(III)) (14.3), arsenate (iAs(V)) (4.9), monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)) (0.64), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)) (13.6), dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)) (7.7), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) (65.4). Blood contained 21.3 microg L(- 1) (mean) As and of which 27.3% was in plasma and 72.7% in RBCs. RBCs contained AsB (21.6%) and DMA(V) (78.4) and blood plasma contained AsB (12.4%), iAs(III) (25.9), MMA(V) (30.3), and DMA(V) (31.4). Furthermore, speciation of As in foodstuffs showed that most of them contained AsB (3.54-25.81 microg kg(- 1)) (25.81-312.44 microg kg(- 1)) along with iAs(III) (9.62-194.93), iAs(V) (17.63-78.33), MMA(V) (9.47-73.22) and DMA(V) (13.43-101.15) that supported the presence of AsB and elevated As in urine and blood samples of the present study group. Inorganic As (iAs) predominates in rice (67.17-86.62%) and in spices (40-90.35%), respectively over organic As. So, As in the food chain is a real threat to human health.","Journal of environmental science and health.

A significant number of samples as different as rice, straw, soil, nail and hair, all coming from the heavily arsenic-contaminated Middle and Lower Ganga plain area, could be investigated with validated methods, supported by high speed extraction methods. For rice and paddy samples, inorganic arsenic counted up to 70-98% of the total arsenic content, being the major species As (III). The levels of arsenic obtained from straw and soil samples are significantly higher than the background levels, being the major species As (V), thus increasing human exposure to arsenic via the soil-plant-animal-human pathway. Concentrations found in hair and nails were significantly higher than their background levels: 39- and 20-fold for hair and nails, respectively. These samples contained mainly inorganic arsenic in its tri- and pentavalent forms. Results indicate that, under the local frame conditions, arsenic mainly enters into the food chain via its more problematic inorganic forms.

Methanol extracts of rice mold starters fermented by the Aspergillus species, A. awamori, A. kawachii, A. oryzae, A. saitoi, and A. sojae, were examined for their antioxidative activity by using a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging system. The extracts of A. awamori, A. kawachii, and A. saitoi exhibited higher activity than those of A. oryzae and A. sojae. An antioxidant was isolated from the extract of A. saitoi and identified as pyranonigrin-A by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and FAB-MS analyses. The antioxidative activity of pyranonigrin-A was approximately equivalent to that of ferulic acid, an antioxidant in cereal grain. It was present in rice mold starters prepared by A. awamori, A. kawachii, and A. saitoi, although there was no pyranonigrin-A in the A. oryzae and A. sojae starters.

17913273,"Mycotoxin contamination in rice is usually lower as in wheat or corn. However, there are some reports that rice has been contaminated with mycotoxins such as aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2 (AFS), citrinin, deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisin B1, B2, B3 (FMS), fusarenon-X (Fus.-X), nivalenol (NIV), ochratoxin A (OTA), sterigmatocystin (STE), and zearalenone. Rice in Japan is preserved in warehouses where moisture content and temperature are regulated. Therefore, mycotoxin contamination from post harvest fungal growth occurs very seldom. Trichothecenes, aflatoxins, and STE in rice were recently analyzed in our laboratory. In 1998, a typhoon struck before rice harvesting in Japan, and the unpolished rice was found to be stained brown. Samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of trichothecenes. Mycotoxins DON, Fus.-X, and NIV were detected and confirmed with GC-MS. The quantity of trichothecenes was determined using GC-ECD. STE is a carcinogenic mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus versicolor and some other fungi. STE contamination of rice was studied in our laboratory since 1973. GC-MS, LC-MS, LC-MS/MS, and LC-UV methods for STE determination were examined, giving good results for the LC-UV method using a photo diode array detector. Different techniques for the extraction of STE from rice were also studied. Finally, brown rice was ground, and the ground rice was extracted with acetonitrile-water. An Autoprep MF-A 1000 column was used to clean up AFS and STE. The cleaned-up extract was analyzed with HPLC-UV. Forty-eight brown rice samples were analyzed, and none of them were contaminated with STE. These rice samples were also analyzed for AFS and FMS, and none of the samples were contaminated.

Levels of furan in various foods were measured in order to identify the products that contribute most to the human intake of furan. Highest amounts were found in products that were heat treated in sealed containers such as jarred and canned food products and in crusty and dry products such as snacks, biscuits, bread crust, roasted wheat flour and roasted coffee beans. Of the analysed jarred baby food products those containing only meat and starch from rice and corn had low levels of furan. In addition, the fruit products showed similar low levels.

17827676,"The signaling processes in plants that initiate cellular responses to biotic and abiotic factors are believed to be located in the plasma membrane (PM). A better understanding of the PM proteome response to environmental stresses might lead to new strategies for improving stress-tolerant crops. A sub-cellular proteomics approach was applied to monitor changes in abundance of PM-associated protein in response to salinity, a key abiotic stress affecting rice productivity worldwide. Proteome was extracted from a root plasma-membrane-rich fraction of a rice salt tolerant variety, IR651, grown under saline and normal conditions. Comparative two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that 24 proteins were differentially expressed in response to salt stress. From these, eight proteins were identified by mass spectrometry analysis. Most of the proteins identified are likely to be PM-associated and are known to be involved in several important mechanisms of plant adaptation to salt stress. These include regulation of PM pumps and channels, membrane structure, oxidative stress defense, signal transduction, protein folding, and the methyl cycle. To investigate the correlation between mRNA and protein level in response to salinity, we performed quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis of three genes that were salt responsive at the protein level, including 1,4-Benzoquinone reductase, a putative remorin and a hypersensitive induced response protein. No concordance was detected between the changes in levels of gene and protein expression. Our results indicate that the proteomics approach is suitable for expression analysis of membrane associated proteins under salt stress.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","['D000251', 'D000595', 'D002462', 'D015180', 'D018506', 'D008565', 'D015394', 'D012275', 'D010940', 'D018517', 'D016133', 'D011485', 'D040901', 'D012333', 'D012965', 'D019032', 'D013997']","['Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Membrane', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oryza', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteomics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Time Factors']",Proteomics reveals new salt responsive proteins associated with rice plasma membrane.,"['Q000378', None, 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000494', None, None]","['metabolism', None, 'drug effects', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'drug effects', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'genetics', 'pharmacology', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17827676,2007

17722143,"The present study investigated rice leaf proteome in response to heat stress. Rice seedlings were subjected to a temperature of 42 degrees C and samples were collected 12 and 24 h after treatment. Increased relative ion leakage and lipid peroxidation suggested that oxidative stress frequently was generated in rice leaves exposed to high temperature. 2-DE, coupled with MS, was used to investigate and identify heat-responsive proteins in rice leaves. In order to identify the low-abundant proteins in leaves, samples were prefractionated by 15% PEG. The PEG supernatant and the pellet fraction samples were separated by 2-DE, and visualized by silver or CBB staining. Approximately 1000 protein spots were reproducibly detected on each gel, wherein 73 protein spots were differentially expressed at least at one time point. Of these differentially expressed proteins, a total of 34 and 39 protein spots were found in the PEG supernatant and pellet fractions, respectively. Using MALDI-TOF MS, a total of 48 proteins were identified. These proteins were categorized into classes related to heat shock proteins, energy and metabolism, redox homeostasis, and regulatory proteins. The results of the present study show that a group of low molecular small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) were newly induced by heat stress. Among these sHSPs, a low molecular weight mitochondrial (Mt) sHSP was validated further by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, four differentially accumulated proteins that correspond to antioxidant enzymes were analyzed at the mRNA level, which confirmed the differential gene expression levels, and revealed that transcription levels were not completely concomitant with translation.

The objective of this study was to characterize the effect of common food additives on digestive recovery of tea catechins. Green tea water extracts were formulated in beverages providing 4.5, 18, 23, and 3.5 mg per 100 mL epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG), and epicatechin-gallate (ECG), respectively. Common commercial beverage additives; citric acid (CA), BHT, EDTA, ascorbic acid (AA), milk (bovine, soy, and rice), and citrus juice (orange, grapefruit, lemon, and lime) were formulated into finished tea beverages at incremental dosages. Samples were then subjected to in vitro digestion simulating gastric and small intestinal conditions with pre- and post-digestion catechin profiles assessed by HPLC. Catechin stability in green tea was poor with <20% total catechins remaining post-digestion. EGC and EGCG were most sensitive with less, not double equals 10% recovery. Teas formulated with 50% bovine, soy, and rice milk increased total catechin recovery significantly to 52, 55, and 69% respectively.

Our findings show differences in transitional-metal levels between polished and unpolished rice and geographical variation in As and selenium (Se) between rice processed in California and the South Central U.S. The mean and median As grain levels for the South Central U.S. were 0.30 and 0.27 mimcrog As g(-1), respectively, for 107 samples. Levels for California were 41% lower than the South Central U.S., with a mean of 0.17 microg As g(-1) and a median of 0.16 microg As g(-1) for 27 samples. The mean and median Se grain levels for the South Central U.S. were 0.19 microg Se g(-1). Californian rice levels were lower, averaging only 0.08 and 0.06 microg Se g(-1) for mean and median values, respectively. The difference between the two regions was found to be significant for As and Se (General Linear Model (GLM): As p < 0.001; Se p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed in As or Se levels between polished and unpolished rice (GLM: As p= 0.213; Se p= 0.113). No significant differences in grain levels of manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), or zinc (Zn) were observed between California and the South Central U.S. Modeling arsenic intake for the U.S. population based on this survey shows that for certain groups (namely Hispanics, Asians, sufferers of Celiac disease, and infants) dietary exposure to inorganic As from elevated levels in rice potentially exceeds the maximum intake of As from drinking water (based on consumption of 1 L of 0.01 mg L(-1) In.

Rice seedlings were exposed to different temperatures, such as 5 or 10 degrees C, and samples were collected after different time course. To eliminate the high-abundant proteins in leaf tissues such as ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), proteins were fractionated by polyethylene glycol (PEG). The elimination of Rubisco from the protein samples was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The PEG fractionated protein samples were separated by 2-DE and visualized by silver or CBB staining. A total 12 up-regulated protein spots were identified using the analysis of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or ESI MS/MS. We identified some novel proteins such as cysteine proteinase, thioredoxin peroxidase, a RING zinc finger protein-like, drought-inducible late embryogenesis abundant, and a fibrillin-like protein that had not yet been reported in the earlier reports on cold proteomic analysis. The identification of some novel low-abundant proteins in response to cold stress may provide a new homeostasis to develop enhanced cold tolerance transgenic plants.

Root secretions of low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOA) for each treatment were measured with ion chromatography. The results showed that LMWOA concentrations in the soil planted with Shan you 63 (a high soil Cd accumulator) were all higher than those in the soil planted with Wu yun jing 7 (low soil Cd accumulator) at different soil Cd levels, although the magnitudes of the differences varied for individual LMWOA and depend on soil Cd concentrations. For all six LMWOA, there were significant differences at P < 0.05 or < 0.01 levels for soils treated with 10 and 50 mg kg(-1) Cd. The magnitude of the differences was greater under soil Cd treatments, especially at relatively low levels (for example, 10 mg Cd kg(-1) soil), than in the control. Acetic acid and formic acid constituted more than 96% of the total concentration of the six LMWOA, while citric acid constituted only about 0.1%.

Minerals were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). The utensils studied exhibited different rates, patterns and variability of migration depending on the type of food. Regression analysis of the data revealed that, as a function of the number of cycles, the iron pans released increasing amounts of iron when tomato sauce was cooked (y = 70.76x + 276.75; R2 = 0.77).

17217179,"A procedure for the simultaneous determination of arsenic, selenium and mercury in foodstuffs has been developed. After a two-step microwave-assisted wet digestion in closed vessels, using concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide, the solution was analysed by inductively coupled plasma multichannel-based emission spectrometry using chemical vapour generation as the sample introduction system. All steps of the procedure, such as solid sample dissolution, pre-reduction to the suitable oxidation state, vapor generation, transport and atomization have been designed and optimised taking into account the concomitant presence of all the analytes considered. Temporal variation of analytical signals as well as interfering effects due to transition elements were also studied. Under the optimised operating conditions, the achieved detection limits for the simultaneous determination of arsenic, selenium and mercury in foodstuffs were 0.006, 0.023 and 0.018 microg g(-1), respectively, allowing their determination in real samples. Precision of the analytical procedure was 6.8% for arsenic, 5.2% for selenium and 7.7% for mercury (n=7).

17189339,"We have analyzed proteome dynamics during light-induced development of rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplasts from etioplasts using quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry protein identification. In the dark, the etioplast allocates the main proportion of total protein mass to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism and a surprisingly high number of proteins to the regulation and expression of plastid genes. Chaperones, proteins for photosynthetic energy metabolism, and enzymes of the tetrapyrrole pathway were identified among the most abundant etioplast proteins. The detection of 13 N-terminal acetylated peptides allowed us to map the exact localization of the transit peptide cleavage site, demonstrating good agreement with the prediction for most proteins. Based on the quantitative etioplast proteome map, we examined early light-induced changes during chloroplast development. The transition from heterotrophic metabolism to photosynthesis-supported autotrophic metabolism was already detectable 2 h after illumination and affected most essential metabolic modules. Enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, and gene expression were up-regulated, whereas enzymes in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism were significantly decreased in relative abundance. Enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism, tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, and redox regulation remained unchanged. Phosphoprotein-specific staining at different time points during chloroplast development revealed light-induced phosphorylation of a nuclear-encoded plastid RNA-binding protein, consistent with changes in plastid RNA metabolism.

17162330,"Phytate, a salt of phytic acid (myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate), is found in certain plant-based foods. It strongly chelates minerals, forming insoluble complexes in the small intestine that cannot be digested or absorbed. Information on the phytate content of rice-based diets of children in Northeast Thailand is limited. In this study 1-day weighed duplicate diet composites were collected from 40 Northeast Thai children (age 6-13 years) randomly selected from participants (n=567) of an efficacy trial in Ubon Ratchathani province. Diet composites were analyzed for zinc, iron, and calcium by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and for phytate (as inositol penta-phosphate and hexa-phosphate) by high-performance liquid chromatography; the accuracy and precision were established using a certified reference material for the minerals and an inter-laboratory comparison for phytate. The median (1st, 3rd quartiles) zinc, iron, and calcium contents of the diet composites were 4.3 (3.7, 6.1), 4.3 (3.2, 6.5) and 130 (82, 216) mg/day, respectively. The inositol penta-phosphate and hexa-phosphate levels were so low they were below the detection limit, attributed in part to leaching of water-soluble potassium and magnesium phytate from glutinous rice after soaking overnight before cooking. Clearly, phytate will not compromise mineral absorption from these diets. Instead, low zinc intakes are probably primarily responsible for the low zinc status of these children. In contrast, although intakes of dietary iron appear low, the prevalence of biochemical iron deficiency was also low, suggesting that iron absorption may have been higher than previously assumed.

The method involved a solid-phase extraction cleanup using a Sep-Pak Plus C-18 cartridge and ion-paired reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (IP-RP-HPLC) separation, followed by detection of HA at its UV absorbance wavelength of 220nm. After evaporating a methanolic extract from the food sample, the resulting residue was reconstituted with 0.2M phosphate buffer (pH 3.0), and subsequently passed through the cartridge. The aliquot of the solution which came out of the cartridge was chromatographed in IP-RP mode on a C-18 column, as the stationary phase, and with a solution of 0.2M phosphate buffer (pH 3.0)-acetonitrile-water (1:24:166, v/v) containing 2mM sodium 1-octane sulfonic acid, as the mobile phase. When this method was applied to a mixture of HA, Cadaverine (Cad), Putrescine (Put), Serotonin (5HT), and Tyramine (Tyr), only HA was detected at 16.4min of retention time. The method was fully validated and validation parameters were: linearity range 2-1000ppm; correlation coefficient >0.991; mean recovery >99.5%; limit of quantification 2ppm and limit of detection 0.5ppm. The method was next applied to 12 brands of Miso (fermented soybean paste), 9 brands of Sake (rice wine), and 5 brands of Shouyu (Japanese soy sauce) to verify its ability to detect the presence of HA in a variety of fermented foods.

A study was undertaken using three different sources of acid waste bentonites, namely soybean oil bentonite (SB), palm oil bentonite (PB), and rice bran oil bentonite (RB). These materials were co-composted with rice husk, rice husk ash, and chicken litter to eliminate their acid reactivity and hydrophobic nature. The organic carbon (OC) content, pH, exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the acid-activated bentonites increased significantly after the co-composting phase. In addition, the hydrophobic nature of these materials as measured using the water drop penetration time (WDPT) decreased from >10 800 s to 16 to 80 s after composting. Furthermore, these composted materials showed positive impacts on soil physical attributes including specific surface area, bulk density, and available water content for crop growth. Highly significant increases in maize biomass (Zea mays L.) production over two consecutive cropping cycles was observed in treatments receiving co-composted bentonite.

Twenty-six proteins were up-regulated with NO(-)(3) as the nitrogen source while 6 were up-regulated with NH(+)(4) as the nitrogen source. MS analysis, in combination with database searching, allowed for only a total of 11 proteins identified with significant probability. Among them 7 nitrate-up-regulated proteins were identified, i.e., a PSII oxygen-evolving complex protein 1 (N1), a putative CC-NBS-LRR resistance protein MLA13 (N2), a 23-kD polypeptide of PSII (N3), a translation initiation factor eIF-5A (N5), a putative PSII oxygen-evolving complex protein 2 precursor (N8), an unknown protein (N17), and the ubiquitin carrier protein UBC7 (N18).

We have developed a novel bio-remediation system based on the symbiosis between leguminous plant and genetically engineered rhizobia. We designed two types of recombinant rhizobia, carrying two genes, synthetic tetrameric metallothionein (MTL4) and cDNA encoding phytochelatin synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPCS). The MTL4 and AtPCS genes were transferred to Mesorhizobium huakuii subsp. rengei B3, which can infect and form nodules on Chinese milk vetch, Astragalus sinicus. The two genes were fused to the nolB or nifH promoter, which generated nodule specific expression of these genes in strain B3. The two recombinant strains, B3(pMPnolBMTL4nifHPCS) and B3::nifHMTL4(pMPnifHPCS), showed 25 and 12-fold increase in Cd concentration, in the free-living cells, respectively. When these recombinant strains established the symbiotic relationship with A. sinicus, the symbionts increased Cd accumulation in nodules by two-fold in hydroponic culture. The expression of the both MTL4 and AtPCS genes showed additive effect on cadmium accumulation in nodules. We also applied these recombinant bacteria to rice paddy soil polluted with Cd (1mgkg(-1) dry weight soil). The accumulation of Cd increased not only in nodules but also in the roots of A. sinicus infected by the recombinant rhizobia. The accumulation of Cd in the plant roots infected by B3(pMPnolBMTL4nifHPCS) achieved three-fold than that by the wild-type B3. After two months of cultivation of the symbiont, a maximum of 9% of Cd in paddy soil was removed.

The present work shows the results of a comparative study of various clean-up and derivatization procedures for analysis of fumonisins in rice cultures. Fumonisins were extracted from rice with acetonitrile/water (50/50, v/v). For clean-up, three solid-phase extraction procedures were assayed (C18 cartridge, SAX cartridge, and a combination of both). Two reagents (o-phthaldialdehyde and 4-fluoro-7-nitro-benzofurazan) were studied comparatively for formation of fluorescent derivatives. The separation was carried out by LC using a fluorescence detector. The best procedure for analysis of fumonisins in rice involved clean-up with C18 cartridge and derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde. The limit of detection was 0.010 mg kg(-1) for both toxins. In the 10-500 mg kg(-1) spiking level range, the recovery rates for FB1 and FB2 in rice varied from 94.6% to 103.6% and from 96.3% to 101.9%, respectively. The optimized analytical method for determination of fumonisins in rice was applied to the study of FB1 and FB2 production by four isolates of the G. fujikuroi species complex in rice cultures carried out at different temperatures and water activities to establish the influence of strain and environmental conditions on fumonisin production in this cereal. In general, fumonisin production was the highest at 20 degrees C and lowest at 37 degrees C.

20507456,"SUMMARY Sheath blight, caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, is a major disease of rice world-wide, but little is known about the host response to infection. The objective of this study was to identify proteins and DNA markers in resistant and susceptible rice associated with response to infection by R. solani. Replicated two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments were conducted to detect proteins differentially expressed under inoculated and non-inoculated conditions. Tandem mass spectra analysis using electrospray ionization quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI Q-TOF MS) was carried out for protein identification with the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Seven proteins were increased after inoculation in both susceptible and resistant plants. Six of the seven proteins were identified with presumed antifungal, photosynthetic and proteolytic activities. An additional 14 proteins were detected in the response of the resistant line. Eleven of the 14 proteins were identified with presumed functions relating to antifungal activity, signal transduction, energy metabolism, photosynthesis, molecular chaperone, proteolysis and antioxidation. The induction of 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase was detected for the first time in resistant rice plants after pathogen challenge, suggesting a defensive role of this enzyme in rice against attack by R. solani. The chromosomal locations of four induced proteins were found to be in close physical proximity to genetic markers for sheath blight resistance in two genetic mapping populations. The proteomic and genetic results from this study indicate a complex response of rice to challenge by R. solani that involves simultaneous induction of proteins from multiple defence pathways.",Molecular plant pathology,[],[],Proteomic and genetic approaches to identifying defence-related proteins in rice challenged with the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20507456,2012
16939348,"Monascus has been used for thousands of years. In China, Monascus has been widely used as a natural food-coloring agent for many kinds of foods. The metabolites of Monascus species, specifically, monacolin K, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and dimerumic acid, have been proven to have cholesterol-lowering, blood pressure-lowering, and antioxidant effects. Nowadays, the public has recognized the importance of Monascus products for its many health benefits. The focus of this study is to explore the effects of nanoparticulate dispersion of red mold rice (RMR) after wet-milling technology treatment. An RMR nanoparticulate formulation was reproducibly obtained after milling in the presence of dispersing agent and water. Furthermore, the physical and chemical properties of these RMR particles were studied using electron microscopy, laser light scattering, pH meter, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and photometry. The results demonstrate that RMR (mean size = 20.15 microm), processed with wet-milling technology, forms an aqueous-based nanoparticle dispersion (mean particle size of less than 0.41 microm). In addition, HPLC analyses, performed on the secondary metabolites, demonstrated that monacolin K was reduced to 50-92% of its base level and citrinin was reduced to 48-74% of its base level. When testing for the levels of pH, the processed RMR had increased from a pH level of 4.47-4.82 to 5.56-6.4; also, pigment analysis showed that yellow and red pigments were reduced to 36 and 39% of its base level after the wet-milling process. Partial agglomeration has been observed in RMR dispersion when stored in refrigeration after 2 months. RMR can be formulated as a nanoparticulate dispersion without compromising its stability, but its secondary metabolite extraction rate was changed.

16939342,"Induction of male sterility by deployment of chemical hybridizing agents (CHAs) are important in heterosis breeding of self-pollinated crops like wheat, wherein the male and female organs are in the same flower. Taking a lead from the earlier work on rice, a total of 25 N-acylanilines comprising of malonanilates, acetoacetanilides, and acetanilides (including halogenated acetanilides) were synthesized and screened as CHAs on three genotypes of wheat, viz., PBW 343, HD 2046, and HD 2733 at 1500 ppm in the winter of 2001-2002. The N-acylanilines containing variations at the acyl and aromatic domain were synthesized by condensation of substituted anilines with appropriate diesters, acid chlorides, or monoesters. The test compounds with highly electronegative groups such as F/Br at the para position of the aryl ring were identified as the most potent CHAs, causing higher induction of male sterility. A variation of N-substitution at the side chain generally furnished analogues like 4'-fluoroacetoacetanilide (7) and ethyl 4'-fluoromalonanilate (1), which induced 89.12 and 84.66% male sterility, respectively, in PBW 343. Among halogenated acetanilides, the increasing number of chlorine atoms in the side chain led to an increase in the activity of 4'-fluoro (23) and 4'-bromo (24) derivatives of trichoroacetanilides, which induced >87% male sterility. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models indicated the positive contributions of the field effect exemplified by the Swain-Lupton constant (Fp) and negative contributions of the Swain-Lupton resonance constant (R) for the aromatic substitution. The positive influences of parachor (P) for the acyl domain have been underlined. These leads will be significant in explaining the CHA fit in the macromolecular receptor site.

Pesticides were extracted from homogenized food samples with acetonitrile and decontaminated via the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) technique, using a primary secondary amine as sorbent prior to GPC-GC/MS analysis. A slightly modified preparation method and automated GPC step proved useful in minimizing matrix interference. To evaluate the performance of the system, 97 target pesticides were spiked at a concentration of 0.1mg/kg into a range of food types, including potato, cabbage, carrot, apple, orange, cucumber, and rice. A low flow rate of 0.1 mL/min in GPC resulted in a 40-fold reduction in solvent consumption compared with conventional GPC column applications. The combination of MSPD technique and GPC-GC/MS for the analysis of the 97 pesticides can be accomplished within 90 min. Most pesticides were recovered in the range of 70-120%, with relative standard deviation generally less than 10%.

The GM rice expresses the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin, CryIAc protein, which confers tolerance to insects. The recombinant CryIAc protein was prepared from the inclusion bodies of an E. coli. strain into which the CryIAc gene had been inserted, using gel filtration chromatography. The lateral flow strip assay for the identification of GM cotton which also expresses CryIAc protein, was applied to unpolished rice and polished rice spiked with recombinant CryIAc protein. The spiked recombinant CryIAc protein was clearly detected at the level of 0.012 microg/g in both the unpolished and polished rice. After loading of the extract on the strip, a 60 -minute stand time is necessary to clearly detect CryIAc protein. The detection limit was approximately 12 ng CryIAc protein per gram of rice.

In current studies, CT and MK are usually detected by different analysis methods, which have a high level of error, and are inconvenient, expensive, and time-consuming. The goal of this study is to establish a rapid synchronous analysis method for the detection of CT, MKL, and MKA levels in RMR. In this study, CT, MKL, and MKA are extracted by the same extraction method and are then separated in a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) C18 column. The elution from the C18 column is then passed through an ultraviolet detector and introduced directly into the fluorescence detector. The results show that higher recovery rates of CT, MKL, and MLK are yielded from RMR powder by extracting with 95% ethanol (10 mL) at 60 degrees C for 30 min.

We applied a proteomic approach to dissect responses of rice roots toward bacterial colonization and jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. Two sister lineages of Oryza sativa were analyzed with cv. IR42 showing a less compatible interaction with the Azoarcus sp. resulting in slight root browning whereas cv. IR36 was successfully colonized as determined by nifHi::gusA activity. External addition of JA inhibited colonization of roots and caused browning in contrast to the addition of ethylene, applied as ethephon (up to 5 mM). Only two of the proteins induced in cv. IR36 by JA were also induced by the endophyte (SalT, two isoforms). In contrast, seven JA-induced proteins were also induced by bacteria in cv. IR42, indicating that IR42 showed a stronger defense response. Mass spectrometry analysis identified these proteins as pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (Prb1, RSOsPR10) or proteins sharing domains with receptorlike kinases induced by pathogens. Proteins strongly induced in roots in both varieties by JA were identified as Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibittors, germinlike protein, putative endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidase, glutathion-S-transferase, and 1-propane-1-carboxylate oxidase synthase, peroxidase precursor, PR10-a, and a RAN protein previously not found to be JA-induced.

The silver-stained proteins spots were analyzed using Image Master 2D software, there were about 1800 detectable spots on each 2D-gel, and about 85 spots were differential expressed. With direct MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis and protein database searching, 9 protein spots out of 16 were identified. Among those proteins, there were Putative nucleic acid binding protein, glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, AGPase) (EC: 2.7.7.27) large chain, UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase, putative calcium-binding protein annexin, putative acetyl-CoA synthetase and putative lipoamide dehydrogenase etc. They were closely associated with metabolism, protein biosynthesis, transcription, signal transduction and so on, all of which are cell activities that are essential to pollen development. Some of the identified proteins, i.e. AGPase, putative lipoamide dehydrogenase and putative acetyl-CoA synthetase were deeply discussed on the relationship to CMS. AGPase catalyzes a very important step in the biosynthesis of alpha 1,4-glucans (glycogen or starch) in bacteria and plants: synthesis of the activated glucosyl donor, ADP-glucose, from glucose-1-phosphate and ATP. The lack of the AGPase in male sterile line might directly result in the reduction of starch, and the synthesis of starch was the most important processes during the development of pollen. In present research, the descent or reduction of putative lipoamide dehydrogenase and putative acetyl-CoA synthetase seemed involved in pollen sterility in rice. The degeneration and formation of various tissues during pollen development may impose high demands for energy and key biosynthetic intermediates. Under such conditions, the TCA cycle needs to operate fully, because the TCA cycle is an important source for many intermediates required for biosynthetic pathways, in addition to performing an oxidative, energy-producing role. Thus, it seemed reasonable to infer that the decrease of putative lipoamide dehydrogenase and putative acetyl-CoA synthetase in anther might prevent the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, and as a result, the TCA cycle could no longer operate at a sufficient rate to meet all requirements in anther cells, leading to pollen sterility. This study gave new insights into the mechanism of CMS in rice and demonstrated the power of the proteomic approach in plant biology studies.",Yi chuan = Hereditas,"['D004591', 'D035264', 'D012275', 'D051479', 'D010940', 'D040901']","['Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flowers', 'Oryza', 'Plant Infertility', 'Plant Proteins', 'Proteomics']",[Preliminary proteomics analysis of the total proteins of HL Type cytoplasmic male sterility rice anther].,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000502', 'Q000378', 'Q000379']","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'physiology', 'metabolism', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16551598,2009

Three rice lots consisting of naturally contaminated, A. parasiticus-infested, and aflatoxin-spiked rice were steamed by ordinary and pressure cookers after they were washed with water. They were chemically analyzed for aflatoxins using a silica solid phase extraction tube and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fluorescence detection (FD), and the presence of aflatoxin residues was confirmed using HPLC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS). An in vitro mutagenicity test with Salmonella typhimurium TA100 was employed to verify the results based on chemical analyses. The aflatoxin loss (78-88%) was notable after pressure cooking, and the reduction of aflatoxin-induced mutagenic potential (68-78%) was in good agreement with the HPLC results. It can be concluded that Koreans are safe from the aflatoxin-related risk if a pressure cooker is employed for cooking rice.

16529425,"Cooking and sensory properties of rice are largely determined by the amylose content and structure. For relationships between functional and structural properties, a more accurate method to determine the structure of amylose is required. Here we calibrate size exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns, using Mark-Houwink parameters for linear starch and pullulan standards, to obtain the true molecular weight distribution of linear starch. When the molecular weight distribution is reported relative to pullulan, rather than the actual molecular weight which is readily obtained from universal calibration, it is seen that the molecular weights of longer amylose chains are greatly underestimated. We validate the SEC method to enable the measurement of the hydrodynamic volume distribution of the starch by examining reproducibility and recovery. Analysis of the starch in the sample pre- and post-SEC shows that 20% of the carbohydrate is not recovered. Comparison of the weight-average degree of polymerization, X(w), of (undebranched) starch of pre- and post-SEC is made using iodine binding as well as Berry plots of data from multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS). These both show that current SEC techniques for starch analysis lead to significant loss of high molecular weight material. Indeed, for the systems studied here, the values for X(w) after SEC are about three times lower than those before SEC. Iodine-starch complexes of pre- and post-SEC samples reveals that the SEC techniques give reliable data for the amylose fraction but not for amylopectin. We address reports in the literature suggesting that the conventional isoamylase method for debranching starch would lead to incomplete debranching and thus incorrect molecular weight distributions. However, it is shown using (1)H NMR that isoamylase can completely debranch the amylose (to within the detection limit of 0.5%), and by SEC that successive incubation with isoamylase, alpha-amylase, and beta-amylase can degrade the amylose-rich fraction completely to maltose. We develop a method to obtain a hot water soluble fraction (HWSF), rich in undamaged amylose molecules, directly from rice flour, avoiding the structural degradation of previous techniques. With appropriate sample handling, the formation of associations between starch chains is minimized. With the combination of calibrated and validated SEC methods, and an improved extraction of amylose from rice, the X(w) for both HWSF and debranched HWSF are found to be much larger than has previously been reported.",Biomacromolecules,"['D000688', 'D001672', 'D002138', 'D002623', 'D002845', 'D005433', 'D007517', 'D046911', 'D009682', 'D008968', 'D008970', 'D012275', 'D000516', 'D001614']","['Amylose', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Calibration', 'Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Chromatography', 'Flour', 'Isoamylase', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oryza', 'alpha-Amylases', 'beta-Amylase']",Improved methods for the structural analysis of the amylose-rich fraction from rice flour.,"['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000295', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, 'instrumentation', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16529425,2006

The new monascopyridines have the same chromophores as the already known and differ in a missing gamma-lactone ring only. Monascopyridine C has a hexanoyl side chain, whereas monascopyridine D is the higher homologue with an octanoyl side chain. The toxicological properties of monascopyridines were studied using immortalized human kidney epithelial cells, displaying cytotoxic effects in micromolar concentrations with median effective concentration values between 20.7 and 43.2 micromol/L, depending on the compound and method used. The monascopyridines C and D did not induce apoptosis. However, they caused a rise of the mitotic index from 3.21 +/- 0.27% (control) to maximum 8.14 +/- 0.89% (monascopyridine D) by an accumulation of cells in the metaphase with a simultaneous decrease of cells in the ana- and telophase. Monascopyridine-induced metaphase arrest is caused by a partial or complete loss of the spindle apparatus as indicated by the occurrence of abnormal metaphases and immunological staining of alpha-tubulin.

Furthermore, ROMT-9 converted flavonoids containing the 3'-hydroxy functional group such as eriodictyol, luteolin, quercetin and taxifolin into the corresponding methoxy derivatives, suggesting that ROMT-9 is an OMT with strict specificity for the 3'-hydroxy group of flavonoids.",Phytochemistry,"['D000595', 'D002109', 'D003001', 'D018076', 'D004926', 'D044950', 'D005419', 'D044948', 'D005786', 'D047311', 'D008969', 'D012275', 'D011497', 'D011794', 'D011994', 'D012436', 'D013379', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Caffeic Acids', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Escherichia coli', 'Flavanones', 'Flavonoids', 'Flavonols', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Luteolin', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oryza', 'Protein O-Methyltransferase', 'Quercetin', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']","Flavonoid 3'-O-methyltransferase from rice: cDNA cloning, characterization and functional expression.","[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000031', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analogs & derivatives', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16412485,2006
16406134,"The Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) virion is composed of two layers of capsid proteins and 10 segments of double-stranded genomic RNA (S1-S10). Due to the fragility of the RBSDV outer capsid, it is very difficult to obtain intact virus particles for preparation of antiserum needed in virus detection. In this work, the major outer capsid protein (P10) encoded by S10 of RBSDV was expressed in Escherichia coli cells as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. After purification of GST-P10 through affinity chromatography, P10 was released from the fusion protein by thrombin digestion and the purified P10 protein was used to immunize rabbits. The resulting polyclonal antiserum specifically recognized RBSDV from infected plant tissue and a planthopper vector in Western blotting assays. To facilitate screening of large numbers of samples, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ID-ELISA) protocol capable of detecting RBSDV in very dilute wheat leaf extracts was developed.

Cooking decreases OTA levels in food to varying extents, but little is known about how cooking changes the biological activity of this mycotoxin. We therefore evaluated the fate of OTA during rice cooking to determine the OTA residues and cytotoxic potential in vitro. Water-washed rice, ordinary cooked rice, and pressure-cooked rice were prepared from three polished rice lots naturally contaminated with OTA. Residual OTA in each sample was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), whereas in vitro cytotoxicity of OTA to C6 glioma cells, susceptible to low levels (nanograms per milliliter) of OTA, was used to confirm the chemical analysis. OTA concentration, as determined by HPLC analysis, in the cooked rice by both types of cookers was significantly lower than (59 to 75%) in the raw polished rice and water-washed rice. The cytotoxicity of the OTA that remained in the pressure-cooked rice from three lots was markedly decreased (approximately 20%, P < 0.05) when compared with other samples in respective lots. This confirms that cooking lowers OTA residues.

16237606,"Prolonged consumption of rice containing elevated cadmium (Cd) levels is a significant health issue particularly in subsistence communities that are dependent on rice produced on-farm. This situation is further exacerbated in areas of known non-ferrous mineralization adjacent to rice-based agricultural systems where the opportunity for contamination of rice and its eventual entry into the food chain is high. In the current study, an assessment of the degree of soil Cd and Zn contamination and associated rice grain Cd contamination downstream of an actively mined zone of Zn mineralization in western Thailand was undertaken. Total soil Cd and Zn concentrations in the rice-based agricultural system investigated ranged from 0.5 to 284 mg kg(-1) and 100 to 8036 mg kg(-1), respectively. Further, the results indicate that the contamination is associated with suspended sediment transported to fields via the irrigation supply. Consequently, the spatial distribution of Cd and Zn is directly related to a field's proximity to primary outlets from in-field irrigation channels and inter-field irrigation flows with 60-100% of the Cd and Zn loading associated with the first three fields in irrigation sequence. Rice grain Cd concentrations in the 524 fields sampled, ranged from 0.05 to 7.7 mg kg(-1). Over 90% of the rice grain samples collected contained Cd at concentrations exceeding the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (CCFAC) draft Maximum Permissible Level for rice grain of 0.2 mg Cd kg(-1). In addition, as a function of demographic group, estimated Weekly Intake (WI) values ranged from 20 to 82 mug Cd per kg Body. This poses a significant public health risk to local communities. The results of this study suggest that an irrigation sequence-based field classification technique in combination with strategic soil and rice grain sampling and the estimation of WI values via rice intake alone may be a useful decision support tool to rapidly evaluate potential public health risks in irrigated rice-based agricultural systems receiving Cd contaminated irrigation water. In addition, the proposed technique will facilitate the cost effective strategic targeting of detailed epidemiological studies thus focusing resources to specific 'high risk' areas.",Environmental geochemistry and health,"['D000383', 'D002104', 'D012275', 'D011634', 'D018570', 'D012987', 'D012989', 'D013054', 'D013785', 'D015032']","['Agriculture', 'Cadmium', 'Oryza', 'Public Health', 'Risk Assessment', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Thailand', 'Zinc']",Elevated levels of cadmium and zinc in paddy soils and elevated levels of cadmium in rice grain downstream of a zinc mineralized area in Thailand: implications for public health.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16237606,2006

Process development indicates that rhLF can be efficiently extracted from rice flour in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing up to 0.5 M NaCl and at a ratio of 1 kg flour to 10 L buffer. After solid/liquid separation, the extract can then be loaded directly onto an ion-exchange column and rhLF can be eluted using 0.8 M NaCl. The resulting rhLF is about 95% pure. A range of biochemical and biophysical analyses were carried out and results indicated that the purified rhLF was identical to its native human counterpart other than its glycosylation. Economic analysis shows that at 600 kg/year scale, the cash cost to produce 1 g of rhLF of pharmaceutical grade is US$ 5.90.

Improved speciation data for rice can be helpful in estimating inorganic arsenic exposures in the U.S. and in endemic populations. The inorganic arsenic exposure for cooked rice should include both the arsenic in raw rice plus the arsenic absorbed from the water used to prepare it. The amount of arsenic absorbed from water by rice during preparation was assessed using five different types of rice cooked in both contaminated drinking water and arsenic-free reagent water. The rice samples were extracted using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and speciated using IC-ICP-MS. The TFA procedure was able to extract 84-104% of the arsenic (As) from the five different cooked rice samples. Chromatographic recoveries ranged from 99% to 116%. The dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and inorganic arsenic concentration ranged from 22 to 270 ng of As/g of rice and from 31 to 108 ng of As/g of rice, respectively, for samples cooked in reagent water. The overall recoveries, which relate the sum of the chromatographic species back to the total digested concentration, ranged from 89% to 117%. The absorption of arsenic by rice from the total volume of water [1:1 to 4:1 (water:rice)] used in cooking was between 89% and 105% for two different contaminated drinking water samples. A comparison of the TFA extraction to an enzymatic extraction was made using the five rice samples and NIST 1568a rice flour. The two extraction procedures produced good agreement for inorganic arsenic, DMA, and the overall recovery.

Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)(4,5)P(2) is one of the best characterized PIs; studies in which PtdIns(4,5)P(2) localization or concentration is altered lead to defects in the actin cytoskeleton and exocytosis. PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and its derivative Ins(1,4,5)P(3) accumulate in salt, cold, and osmotically stressed plants. PtdIns(4,5)P(2) signaling is terminated through the action of inositol polyphosphate phosphatases and PI phosphatases including supressor of actin mutation (SAC) domain phosphatases. In some cases, these phosphatases also act on Ins(1,4,5)P(3). We have characterized the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) sac9 mutants. The SAC9 protein is different from other SAC domain proteins in several ways including the presence of a WW protein interaction domain within the SAC domain. The rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis SAC9 protein sequences are similar, but no apparent homologs are found in nonplant genomes. High-performance liquid chromatography studies show that unstressed sac9 mutants accumulate elevated levels of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and Ins(1,4,5)P(3) as compared to wild-type plants. The sac9 mutants have characteristics of a constitutive stress response, including dwarfism, closed stomata, and anthocyanin accumulation, and they overexpress stress-induced genes and overaccumulate reactive-oxygen species.

They were analyzed for ochratoxin A using immunoaffinity column and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fluorescence detection, and the positive samples were confirmed using HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. By combining results from different surveys on the levels of ochratoxin A in selected foods and the consumption patterns, we obtained the Korean probable daily intakes (PDI) of ochratoxin A. The polished rice commodity had the highest mean levels of ochratoxin A, which ranged from 0.2 (not detected, i.e., ND = 0) to 1.0 ng/g (ND = limit of detection, i.e., LOD). The estimated PDI for all Koreans fell into the range of 0.8-4.1 ng/kg bw/day, while for heavy consumers the estimates ranged from 1.7 to 9.1 ng/kg bw/day, which did not exceed the PTDI value (14 ng/kg bw/day).

The difference in Mo content among food groups was marked; Mo levels in several plant foods such as cereals were more than 0.5 g/g while those in most animal foods were less than 0.1 microg/g. In particular, Mo contents in several samples of seeds and pulses were more than mixeo 1 mirog/g. The variation in Mo contents in each type of cereal was also conspicuous. Based on the present quantification of Mo in foods and the recent National Nutrition Survey in Japan, the average Mo intake of the Japanese population was estimated as 225 microg/d/capita.

15863519,"The phloem macromolecular transport system plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. However, little information is available regarding whether the long-distance trafficking of macromolecules is a controlled process or passive movement. Here, we demonstrate the destination-selective long-distance trafficking of phloem proteins. Direct introduction, into rice (Oryza sativa), of phloem proteins from pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) was used to screen for the capacity of specific proteins to move long distance in rice sieve tubes. In our system, shoot-ward translocation appeared to be passively carried by bulk flow. By contrast, root-ward movement of the phloem RNA binding proteins 16-kD C. maxima phloem protein 1 (CmPP16-1) and CmPP16-2 was selectively controlled. When CmPP16 proteins were purified, the root-ward movement of CmPP16-1 became inefficient, suggesting the presence of pumpkin phloem factors that are responsible for determining protein destination. Gel-filtration chromatography and immunoprecipitation showed that CmPP16-1 formed a complex with other phloem sap proteins. These interacting proteins positively regulated the root-ward movement of CmPP16-1. The same proteins interacted with CmPP16-2 as well and did not positively regulate its root-ward movement. Our data demonstrate that, in addition to passive bulk flow transport, a destination-selective process is involved in long-distance movement control, and the selective movement is regulated by protein-protein interaction in the phloem sap.",The Plant cell,"['D028464', 'D046911', 'D012275', 'D010940', 'D018517', 'D018520', 'D011485', 'D021381', 'D016601']","['Cucurbita', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Oryza', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Shoots', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins']",Destination-selective long-distance movement of phloem proteins.,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000378']","['metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'physiology', 'physiology', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15863519,2005

The extraction was carried out with ethyl acetate and an on-line extraction method applying an acetone-dichloromethane mixture. The extracts were cleaned up with SX-3 gel, an adsorbent mixture of active carbon, magnesia, and diatomaceous earth, and on silica micro cartridges. The Rf values of 118 pesticides were tested in eleven elution systems with UV, and eight biotest methods and chemical detection reagents. Cabbage, green peas, orange, and tomatoes were selected as representative sample matrices for fruits and vegetables, while maize, rice, and wheat represented cereal grains. As an internal quality control measure, marker compounds were applied on each plate to verify the proper elution and detection conditions. The Rf values varied in the different elution systems. The best separation (widest Rf range) was achieved with silica gel (SG)--ethyl acetate (0.05-0.7), SG--benzene, (0.02-0.7) and reverse phase RP-18 F-254S layer with acetone: methanol: water/30:30:30 (v/v) (0.1-0.8). The relative standard deviation of Rf values (CV(Rf)) within laboratory reproducibility was generally less than 20%, except below 0.2 Rf, where the CVRf rapidly increased with decreasing Rf values.

G. zeae produces sexual spores (ascospores, dispersed by wind) and asexual spores (macroconidia, dispersed by rain droplets) to infect host plants. The production of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) and the germination of ascospores and macroconidia of G. zeae were studied at 20 degrees C in relation to relative humidity (RH). The DON contents of wheat heads and autoclaved rice grain samples, artificially inoculated with ascospore or macroconidia suspensions of equal spore density, were determined at 35 days after inoculation by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The average DON production 35 days after inoculation was much lower on rice (3.95+/-1.34 mg kg(-1)) than on wheat heads (302.30+/-57.46 mg kg(-1)). Macroconidia inoculi produced more DON than ascospore inoculi at relative humidities >90%, but less DON between 53% and 80% RH. At RH < or = 53%, no significant differences in DON production were observed between macroconidia and ascospore inoculi. DON production increased with RH irrespective of spore type. Germination of ascospores and macroconidia was monitored during incubation above six constant humidity solutions ranging from 30% to 93% RH. Ascospores only required a RH > or = 53%, whereas macroconidia required RH of > or = 80% for germination. The different humidity requirements of the two spore types for germination are discussed as a potential reason for the differential DON production of ascospore and macroconidia inoculi in relation to humidity.

15638245,"All fruits, vegetables, and grains contain phytosterols. Numerous clinical studies have documented that phytosterols lower LDL-cholesterol levels and thereby reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Most experts believe that the cholesterol-lowering mechanism of phytosterols requires that they be in their ""free"" form. In addition to their occurrence in the free form, phytosterols also occur as four common phytosterol conjugates: (i) fatty acyl esters, (ii) hydroxycinnamate esters, (iii) steryl glycosides, and (iv) fatty acylated steryl glycosides. This study was undertaken to investigate the extent of hydrolysis of four common phytosterol conjugates by mammalian digestive enzymes (cholesterol esterase and pancreatin, a mixture of pancreatic enzymes) and for comparison purposes, by KOH. Two types of purified hydroxycinnamate esters (sitostanyl ferulate and oryzanol, a mixture of hydroxycinnamate esters purified from rice bran oil) were hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase and by pancreatin. Both cholesterol esterase and pancreatin hydrolyzed the phytosteryl esters in two functional food matrices, and they hydrolyzed the hydroxycinnamate esters in corn fiber oil. This is the first report to demonstrate that phytostanyl ferulate esters (which are present at levels of 3-6% in corn fiber oil) are hydrolyzed by pancreatic cholesterol esterase. It is also the first report that pancreatin contains enzymes that hydrolyze the fatty acyl moiety of fatty acylated steryl glycoside, converting it to steryl glycoside. Pancreatin had no effect on steryl glycosides. The ability of pancreatin to hydrolyze three other types of lipid conjugates was also evaluated. Phospholipids were completely hydrolyzed. About half of the galactolipids were hydrolyzed, and less than 10% of the polyamine conjugates were hydrolyzed. The extents of hydrolysis of phytosteryl esters by base (saponification) were also studied, and conditions commonly used for the saponification of acyl lipids (1.5 N methanolic KOH, 30 min at 70 degrees C), were found to result in a nearly 100% hydrolysis of TAG but only about 35-45% hydrolysis of the phytosteryl fatty acyl esters or phytosteryl hydroxycinnamate esters.",Lipids,"['D000818', 'D002851', 'D004950', 'D005502', 'D006868', 'D008322', 'D015394', 'D010840', 'D013696']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Esterases', 'Food', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mammals', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phytosterols', 'Temperature']",The in vitro hydrolysis of phytosterol conjugates in food matrices by mammalian digestive enzymes.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15638245,2005

Fraction eluted by 40% methanol from Amberlite XAD 2 chromatography of sugar cane vinegar showed potent radical scavenging activity. The fraction also showed the activity repressing growth of typical human leukemia cells such as HL-60, THP-1, Molt-4, U-937, Jurkat, Raji and K-562. On the other hand, the fraction did not have any growth inhibition activity against human fetal lung cell TIG-1.

From cell sorting FACS analyses, electron microscopic observations and cytochemical staining of chromatin and nuclear segments in human leukemia cell HL-60 treated with the active fraction, it was concluded that apoptosis was induced in the leukemia cell by the fraction of sugar cane vinegar and resulted in the repression of growth of the human leukemia cells. Chromatographic fraction of sugar cane juice eluted by 20% methanol showed potent activities of radical-scavenging and growth repression of HL-60.

PCBs, PCDFs and PCDDs suspended in nonane were incubated with RBF (10 mg/ml) at 37 degrees C and after centrifugation, unbound chemicals in the supernatant were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). The binding effects on RBF were enhanced more than other dietary fibers (DFs), which were tested including corn, wheat bran, spinach, Hijiki (a kind of seaweed), sweet potatoes and burdock fibers.

15627959,"In classical proteomic studies, the searches in protein databases lead mostly to the identification of protein functions by homology due to the non-exhaustiveness of the protein databases. The quality of the identification depends on the studied organism, its complexity and its representation in the protein databases. Nevertheless, this basic function identification is insufficient for certain applications namely for the development of RNA-based gene-silencing strategies, commonly termed RNA interference (RNAi) in animals and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants, that require an unambiguous identification of the targeted gene sequence. A PTGS strategy was considered in the study of the infection of Oryza sativa by the Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (RYMV). It is suspected that the RYMV recruits host proteins after its entry into plant cells to form a complex facilitating virus multiplication and spreading. The protein partners of this complex were identified by a classical proteomic approach, nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Among the identified proteins, several were retained for a PTGS strategy. Nevertheless most of the protein candidates appear to be members of multigenic families for which all paralog genes are not present in protein databases. Thus the identification of the real expressed paralog gene with classical protein database searches is impossible. Consequently, as the genome contains all genes and thus all paralog genes, a whole genome search strategy was developed to determine the specific expressed paralog gene. With this approach, the identification of peptides matching only a single gene, called discriminant peptides, allows definitive proof of the expression of this identified gene.

In this study, we have not only identified genes putatively encoding enzymes involved in N-glycosylation, but have examined by MALDI-TOF MS the structures of the N-glycans of rice and other monocotyledons (maize, wheat and dates; Zea mays, Triticum aestivum and Phoenix dactylifera); these data show that within the plant kingdom the types of N-glycans found are very similar between monocotyledons, dicotyledons and gymnosperms. Subsequently, we constructed expression vectors for the key enzymes forming plant-typical structures in rice, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc-TI; EC 2.4.1.101), core alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase (FucTA; EC 2.4.1.214) and beta1,2-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.38) and successfully expressed them in Pichia pastoris.

Efficacy of five nitrification inhibitors, i.e. neem (Azadirachta melia) cake, thiosulphate, coated calcium carbide, neem oil coated urea and dicyandiamide (DCD) and one urease inhibitor, hydroquinone, in mitigating N2O and CH4 emissions from fertilized soil was tested in rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The closed chamber technique was used for the collection of gas samples, which were analyzed using gas chromatography. Reduction in N2O emission on the application of nitrification/urease inhibitors along with urea ranged from 5% with hydroquinone to 31% with thiosulphate in rice and 7% with hydroquinone to 29% with DCD in wheat crop. The inhibitors also influenced the emission of CH4. While application of neem coated urea, coated calcium carbide, neem oil and DCD reduced the emission of CH4; hydroquinone and thiosulphate increased the emission when compared to urea alone.

15560932,Acrylamide is known for its potential health hazards. Recently acrylamide was found in starch containing heated foods in high concentrations which lead to the assumption that a cancer risk could be associated with the uptake of foods containing high amounts of acrylamide. This study focuses on the analysis of acrylamide in foods potentially containing this substance which is formed from natural ingredients. The highest concentrations were found in potato crisps with concentrations of above 1500 ng/g (median: 499 ng/g). Other food groups contained lower amounts: cookies with a median of 99 ng/g; crisp bread with a median of 69 ng/g; breakfast cereals with a median of 0 ng/g; popcorn and rice products with a median of 97 ng/g; potato chips with a median of 161 ng/g and coffee with a median of 169 ng/g.,Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods,"['D020106', 'D001317', 'D002273', 'D002851', 'D005502', 'D005504', 'D005506']","['Acrylamide', 'Austria', 'Carcinogens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination']",Acrylamide in Austrian foods.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15560932,2005

To investigate the effect of exposure to cadmium at a level insufficient to induce kidney damage on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism, we conducted health examinations on 1380 female farmers from five districts in Japan who consumed rice contaminated by low-to-moderate levels of cadmium. We collected peripheral blood and urine samples and medical and nutritional information, and measured forearm BMD. Analysis of the data for subjects grouped by urinary cadmium level and age-related menstrual status suggested that cadmium accelerates both the increase of urinary calcium excretion around the time of menopause and the subsequent decrease in bone density after menopause. However, multivariate analyses showed no significant contribution of cadmium to bone density or urinary calcium excretion, indicating that the results mentioned above were confounded by other factors. These results indicate that environmental exposure to cadmium at levels insufficient to induce renal dysfunction does not increase the risk of osteoporosis, strongly supporting the established explanation for bone injury induced by cadmium as a secondary effect.",Environmental research,"['D000383', 'D001774', 'D015519', 'D002104', 'D002118', 'D003401', 'D004781', 'D004797', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D015592', 'D007564', 'D007674', 'D007684', 'D016015', 'D015999', 'D012275', 'D013054']","['Agriculture', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Bone Density', 'Cadmium', 'Calcium', 'Creatine', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Immunoradiometric Assay', 'Japan', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Tubules', 'Logistic Models', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oryza', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",Environmental exposure to cadmium at a level insufficient to induce renal tubular dysfunction does not affect bone density among female Japanese farmers.,"[None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000032', 'Q000652', 'Q000652', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000209', 'Q000503', None, None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, 'drug effects', 'analysis', 'urine', 'urine', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'etiology', 'physiopathology', None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15476737,2004

This method has the significant advantage of avoiding the generation and use of diazomethane, and is done in aqueous solution without the need to dry the sample with concomitant non-specific losses of IAA. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by its use in an isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) assay of IAA and L-tryptophan (Trp) in the culture supernatant of a series of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii strains that can interact with rice to either enhance or inhibit rice plant growth.

15358508,"Factors influencing the production of cereulide, the emetic toxin of Bacillus cereus in food and laboratory media were investigated, using liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry and sperm motility inhibition bioassay for detection and quantitation. Oxygen was essential for production of the emetic toxin by B. cereus. When beans, rice or tryptic soy broth were inoculated with cereulide producing strains B203, B116 (recent food isolates) or the strain F-4810/72, high amounts (2 to 7 microg ml(-1) or g(-1) wet wt) of cereulide accumulated during 4-day storage at room temperature. In parallel cultures and foods, stored under nitrogen atmosphere (> 99.5% N2), less than 0.05 microg of cereulide ml(-1) or g(-1) wet wt accumulated. The outcome of the bioassay matched that of the chemical assay, with no indication of interference by substances in the rice or beans. Boiling for 20 to 30 min did not inactivate cereulide or cereulide producing strains in rice or the beans. Adding l-leucine and l-valine (0.3 g l(-1)) stimulated cereulide production 10- to 20-fold in R2A and in rice water agar. When the B. cereus strains were grown on agar media under permissive conditions (air, room temperature), cereulide was produced overnight with little or no increase when the incubation was extended to 4 days. In broth culture, the production of cereulide started later than 16-24 h. Anoxic storage prevented cereulide production also when the amino acids had been supplied.

The oxidised proteins in both samples were tagged with dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP), which forms a covalent bond with carbonyl groups. The DNP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-DNP antibodies and digested with trypsin. The mixture of peptides was analysed by nano-HPLC coupled online to an ESI-Quad-TOF mass spectrometer. The peptides were separated by stepwise ion exchange chromatography followed by reverse phase chromatography (2D-LC), and analysed by MS/MS. Proteins were identified by un-interpreted fragment ion database searches. Using this approach we identified 20 oxidised proteins in the control sample and a further 32 in the oxidised sample. Western blots of 2D-gels of the same samples prior to immunoprecipitation verified that the oxidation treatment increases protein oxidation also for specific proteins.

The levels of two Fusarium toxins, nivalenol and deoxynivalenol (DON) were quantitated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a total of 97 samples of dietary wheat flour, barley and corn collected from families in two areas with high mortality rate of cancer of esophagus and gastric cardia (132/100,000), Linxian, Henan province and Cixiang, Hepei province, China. The mean level of NIV and DON in three dietary foods was 830+/-927 microg/kg (range 584-1,780 microg/kg) and 4,281+/-6,114 microg/kg (range 732-10,980 microg/kg) respectively. The highest mean level of NIV was 1,780+/-1,705 microg/kg found in barley from Linxian, that of DON was 10,980+/-10,139 microg/kg found in corn from Cixiang. NIV was undetectable in 2 samples of rice from USA. The mean levels of NIV in three main dietary foods in those two high-risk areas were estimated at 400 to 800-fold higher than that in the USA, where NIV was undetectable in dietary food, and the mortality rate of esophageal cancer is <5/100,000 in white Caucasians in the USA, (odds ratio was estimated at 17-34, p<0.000005).

Seafood is the main contributor to arsenic intake for adults while terrestrial-based food is the primary source for infants. Processed infant food products such as rice-based cereals, mixed rice/formula cereals, milk-based infant formula, applesauce and puree of peaches, pears, carrots, sweet potatoes, green beans, and squash were evaluated for total and speciated arsenic content. Arsenic concentrations found in rice-based cereals (63-320 ng/g dry weight) were similar to those reported for raw rice. Results for the analysis of powdered infant formula by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) indicated a narrow and low arsenic concentration range (12 to 17 ng/g). Arsenic content in puree infant food products, including rice cereals, fruits, and vegetables, varies from <1 to 24 ng/g wet weight. Sample treatment with trifluoroacetic acid at 100 degrees C were an efficient and mild method for extraction of arsenic species present in different food matrixes as compared to alternative methods that included sonication and accelerated solvent extraction. Extraction recoveries from 94 to 128% were obtained when the summation of species was compared to total arsenic. The ion chromatography (IC)-ICP-MS method selected for arsenic speciation allowed for the quantitative determination of inorganic arsenic [As(III) + As(V)], dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and methylarsonic acid (MMA). Inorganic arsenic and DMA are the main species found in rice-based and mixed rice/formula cereals, although traces of MMA were also detected. Inorganic arsenic was present in freeze-dried sweet potatoes, carrots, green beans, and peaches. MMA and DMA were not detected in these samples.

To extend our knowledge of the rice proteome, the subcellular compartments, which include plasma membranes (PM), vacuolar membranes (VM), Golgi membranes (GM), mitochondria (MT), and chloroplasts (CP), were purified from rice seedlings and cultured suspension cells. The proteins of each of these compartments were then systematically analyzed using two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and Edman sequencing, followed by database searching. In all, 58 of the 464 spots detected by 2D electrophoresis in PM, 43 of the 141 spots in VM, 46 of the 361 spots in GM, 146 in the 672 spots in MT, and 89 of the 252 spots in CP could be identified by this procedure. The characterized proteins were found to be involved in various processes, such as respiration and the citric acid cycle in MT; photosynthesis and ATP synthesis in CP; and antifungal defense and signal systems in the membranes. Edman degradation revealed that 60-98% of N-terminal sequences were blocked, and the ratios of blocked to unblocked proteins in the proteomes of the various subcellular compartments differed.

14652184,"A new model for energy exchange between translational and internal degrees of freedom in atom-molecule collisions has been developed. It is suitable for both steady state conditions (e.g., a large number of collisions with thermal kinetic energies) and non-steady state conditions with an arbitrary distribution of collision energies (e.g., single high-energy collisions). In particular, it does not require that the collision energies be characterized by a quasi-thermal distribution, but nevertheless it is capable of producing a Boltzmann distribution of internal energies with the correct internal temperature under quasi-thermal conditions. The energy exchange is described by a transfer probability density that depends on the initial relative kinetic energy, the internal energy of the molecule, and the amount of energy transferred. The probability density for collisions that lead to excitation is assumed to decrease exponentially with the amount of transferred energy. The probability density for de-excitation is obtained from microscopic reversibility. The model has been implemented in the ion trap simulation program ITSIM and coupled with an Rice-Rampsberger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) algorithm to describe the unimolecular dissociation of populations of ions. Monte Carlo simulations of collisional energy transfer are presented.

We describe a methodology for the detection of gliadins in maize and rice foods based on a two-step procedure of extraction (60% aqueous ethanol followed by 1 M acetic acid). Subsequent MALDI-TOFMS analysis of the resulting acidic extract from these gluten-free foods clearly confirms the presence of a typical mass pattern corresponding to gliadin components, ranging from 30 to 45 kDa. Depending on the percentages of maize or rice flours employed in the elaboration of these foods, the combined procedure enables levels of gliadins from 100 to 400 ppm to be detected.

We determined the blood concentration of these dioxin-like isomers in 78 blood samples collected in 2001 using by a high-resolution gas chromatograph/high-resolution mass spectrometer (HRGC/HRMS) equipped with a solvent-cut large volume injection system (SCLV). The accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) method was employed for the treatment of blood samples. The method employed here can allow a reduced amount of blood collecting from Yusho patients compared with the conventional method. In typical Yusho patients (Group A of PCB pattern), the mean TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, Non-Co-PCBs, and Mono-Co-PCBs in blood collected in 2001 were 36, 260, 9.3, and 64 pg-TEQ/g lipid, respectively.

Bound fractions were eluted and subjected to one-dimensional electrophoresis, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analysis of separated proteins. This multiplexed technology resulted in the isolation and identification of 136 distinct mannose binding proteins from rice. A comparative analysis demonstrates very little overlap of identified proteins between the respective tissues, and confirms the correctly compartmentalized presence of a significant number of proteins from largely tissue-specific biochemical pathways. Over 30% of the identified proteins with a previously annotated function are directly involved in sugar metabolism, including several highly expressed known rice lectins. Direct comparison of the peptide sequences identified in this study to those peptides identified in the most comprehensive survey of the rice proteome to date indicates that our current data represents a significant enrichment of proteins unique to this dataset.

12769739,"There are many examples of biologically active food proteins, with physiological significance beyond the pure nutritional requirements that concern available nitrogen for normal growth and maintenance. Moreover, there are many physiologically active peptides, derived by protease activity from various food protein sources; however, relationships between structural properties and functional activities have not been completely elucidated. Many bioactive peptides have in common structural properties that include a relatively short peptide residue length (e.g. 2-9 amino acids), possessing hydrophobic amino acid residues in addition to proline, lysine or arginine groups. Bioactive peptides are also resistant to the action of digestion peptidases. Antihypertensive peptides, known as Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been derived from milk, corn and fish protein sources. Peptides with opioid activities are derived from wheat gluten or casein, following digestion with pepsin. Exorphins, or opioid peptides derived from food proteins such as wheat and milk (e.g. exogenous sources) have similar structure to endogenous opioid peptides, with a tyrosine residue located at the amino terminal or bioactive site. Immunomodulatory peptides derived from tryptic hydrolysates of rice and soybean proteins act to stimulate superoxide anions (reactive oxygen species-ROS), which triggers non-specific immune defense systems. Antioxidant properties that prevent peroxidation of essential fatty acids have also been shown for peptides derived from milk proteins. The addition of a Leu or Pro residue to the N-terminus of a His-His, dipeptide will enhance antioxidant activity and facilitate further synergy with non-peptide antioxidants (e.g. BHT). We also show herein, that the tryptic digests of casein yielding caseinophosphopeptides exhibits both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity due to both metal ion sequestering and quenching of ROS. The separation and purification of bioactive peptides which will involve development of automated and continuous systems is an important field for Food chemists. Much effort has been given to develop selective column chromatography methods that can replace batch methods of salting out, or using solvent extraction to isolate and purify bioactive peptides.

Proteins were extracted from the anther samples and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to produce proteome maps. The anther proteome maps of different developmental stages were compared and 150 protein spots, which were changed consistently during development, were analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to produce peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) data. Database searches using these PMF data revealed the identities of 40 of the protein spots analyzed. These 40 proteins represent 33 unique gene products. Four protein spots that could not be identified by PMF analysis were analysed by N-terminal microsequencing. Multiple charge-isoforms of vacuolar acid invertase, fructokinase, beta-expansin and profilin were identified. These proteins are closely associated with sugar metabolism, cell elongation and cell expansion, all of which are cell activities that are essential to pollen germination. The existence of multiple isoforms of the same proteins suggests that during the process of pollen development some kind of post-translational modification of these proteins occurs.",Proteomics,"['D000595', 'D050260', 'D015180', 'D008565', 'D008969', 'D016366', 'D012275', 'D010449', 'D010940', 'D020543', 'D040901', 'D019032']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Oryza', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Plant Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Proteome analysis of male gametophyte development in rice anthers.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'genetics', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12748952,2004

In addition to nutritional or toxicological considerations, the relatively high level and variety of As species present in rice make it a very suitable matrix for a candidate reference material representative of terrestrial biological samples.An analytical procedure was developed for As speciation in rice based on the use of a 1:1 methanol-water mixture for species extraction, an anion Hamilton PRPX-100 column (at pH 6, and phosphate mobile phase 10 mM), and a cation Hamilton PRP-X200 column (at pH 2.8 in pyridine formiate 4 mM) for species separation and final determination by HPLC-ICP-MS. The detection limits for dry flour rice expressed as As were 2 and 3 ng g(-1) for As(III) and AsB on the cation column and 3, 6 and 5 ng g(-1) for As(V), MMA and DMA, respectively, on the anion column. The methodology developed was applied to check the stability of As species in the water-methanol extract and also under different processing steps and storage time and temperature conditions. It was demonstrated that the As species in the water-methanol extracts stored at +4 degrees C remained stable for at least one month. Once the rice grains are ground, the MMA and As(V) species are not stable under any storage conditions probably due to microbiological activity.

To compare the uptake and excretion of anthocyanins in humans and WHHL rabbits, single-dose black currant anthocyanin studies were performed. Procedures for workup and analyses of urine and plasma samples containing anthocyanins were developed with high recoveries (99 and 81%, respectively) and low limits of quantification (> or =6.6 and > or =1.1 nM, respectively). The excretion and absorption of anthocyanins from black currant juice were found to be within the same order of magnitude in the two species regarding urinary excretion within the first 4 h (rabbits, 0.035%; humans, 0.072%) and t(max) (rabbits, approximately 30 min; humans, approximately 45 min). A food matrix effect was detected in rabbits, resulting in the absorption of a higher proportion of the anthocyanins from black currant juice than from an aqueous citric acid matrix. In humans the absorption and urinary excretion of anthocyanins from black currant juice were found to be proportional with dose and not influenced by the ingestion of a rice cake. In both species a larger proportion of the anthocyanin rutinosides than of the glucosides was absorbed, whereas the structure of the aglycon had no influence on the absorption and excretion.

Proteins were extracted from rice leaf sheath at 0, 12, 24, 48 h after cutting and separated by two-dimensional (2-D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Changes in differentially displayed proteins were found in leaf sheaths after cutting in the 0-48 h time course.

The clear functions of nine proteins could be identified. Six proteins did not yield amino acid sequence information due to their blocked N-termini. Furthermore, 11 proteins were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and identified protein database matching. It was shown that the down-regulated proteins were calreticulin (nos. 5, 6), histone H1 (no. 15) and hemoglobin (no. 17), putative peroxidase (no. 19); the up-regulated proteins were Bowman-Birk trypsin inhibitor (no. 23), putative receptor-like protein kinase (nos. 24, 25), calmodulin-related protein (no. 26), small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (no. 27), mannose-binding rice lectin (nos. 28, 29).

Hydrophilic GD(3) and lipophilic GM(3) selectively bound rotavirus particles prepared from a rhesus strain and its mutant. A GS fraction in IBM showed a GM(1)-specific binding to cholera toxin subunit B (CTB). IBM serum (IBMS) was a rich source of LBSA (420 nmol/g proteins). In summary, improved methodology led to increased LBSA recovery and isolation of additional and bioactive milk GS. Human and Italian buffalo milk had similar CTB binding, and both had increased polysialo-GS compared to cows milk.

12428011,"In most species, the synthesis of ADP-glucose (Glc) by the enzyme ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) occurs entirely within the plastids in all tissues so far examined. However, in the endosperm of many, if not all grasses, a second form of AGPase synthesizes ADP-Glc outside the plastid, presumably in the cytosol. In this paper, we show that in the endosperm of wheat (Triticum aestivum), the cytosolic form accounts for most of the AGPase activity. Using a combination of molecular and biochemical approaches to identify the cytosolic and plastidial protein components of wheat endosperm AGPase we show that the large and small subunits of the cytosolic enzyme are encoded by genes previously thought to encode plastidial subunits, and that a gene, Ta.AGP.S.1, which encodes the small subunit of the cytosolic form of AGPase, also gives rise to a second transcript by the use of an alternate first exon. This second transcript encodes an AGPase small subunit with a transit peptide. However, we could not find a plastidial small subunit protein corresponding to this transcript. The protein sequence of the purified plastidial small subunit does not match precisely to that encoded by Ta.AGP.S.1 or to the predicted sequences of any other known gene from wheat or barley (Hordeum vulgare). Instead, the protein sequence is most similar to those of the plastidial small subunits from chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) seeds.

In addition, several previously characterized allergenic proteins were identified in the seed sample, indicating the potential of proteomic approaches to survey food samples with regard to the occurrence of allergens.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"['D000595', 'D002851', 'D015180', 'D013058', 'D008969', 'D012275', 'D010940', 'D020543', 'D017386']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oryza', 'Plant Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",Proteomic survey of metabolic pathways in rice.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12163647,2002
12113455,"Using particle bombardment-mediated transformation, a codon-optimized synthetic gene for human lysozyme was introduced into the calli of rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar Taipei 309. The expression levels of recombinant human lysozyme in the transformed rice suspension cell culture approached approximately 4% of total soluble protein. Recombinant human lysozyme was purified to greater than 95% homogeneity using a two-step chromatography process. Amino acid sequencing verified that the N-terminus of the mature recombinant human lysozyme was identical to native human lysozyme. This indicates that the rice RAmy3D signal peptide was correctly cleaved off from the human lysozyme preprotein by endogenous rice signal peptidase. Recombinant human lysozyme was found to have the same molecular mass, isoelectric point and specific activity as native human lysozyme. The bactericidal activity of recombinant human lysozyme was determined by turbidimetric assay using Micrococcus lysodeikticus in 96-well microtiter plates. The bactericidal activity of lysozyme on gram-negative bacteria was examined by adding purified lysozyme to mid-log phase cultures of E. coli strain JM109. In this study, significant bactericidal activity was observed after E. coli cells were exposed to recombinant human lysozyme for 60 min. Both native and recombinant human lysozyme displayed the same thermostability and resistance to degradation by low pH.

Extraction of each sample with acetonitrile was followed by a salting-out step using a graduated cylinder. The test solution was cleaned up with gel permeation chromatography (GPC), which separated the pesticide eluate into 2 fractions, and then with a tandem mini-column. Analysis was done with a dual-column GC equipped with a dual NPD and FPD (S mode) detector. Use of the Siltek-deactivated liner, guard column, and Y connector, and Silcosteel-treated NPD jet was effective for preventing the breakdown of sulfur-containing pesticides. Recoveries of 87 nitrogen-containing and sulfur-containing pesticides from fortified spinach, tomato, apple, strawberry and brown rice, ranged from 71 to 127% with RSD values of 1-24%, except for recoveries of aldicarb, amitraz, ethiofencarb, imazalil, propamocarb and triflumizole. Detection limits of pesticides were very good (0.3-5 ppb (NPD) and 2-20 ppb (FPD)) for routine analysis of pesticide residues in foods. Surveillance of pesticides in agricultural products was carried out by using the present method. From 22 out of 33 samples, 21 pesticides (43 in total) were detected.

Their median levels (range) were as follows: beta-HCH, 0.50 (0.05-1.50); HCB, 0.20 (0.02-0.70); and total DDT (p,p'-DDE + p,p'-DDT), 5.0 (0.9-31.0) ng/ml serum. Levels of p,p'-DDD were detected in only seven subjects (0.05-0.6 ng/ml serum). The beta-HCH levels were increased with rice and milk intakes, but the least squares means were not simply increased according to the quartile of the intakes. Concerning HCB, fish intake showed a borderline significant correlation (0.20, P = 0.052). In terms of total DDT, intakes of meat, fish, vegetable and milk showed a positive relationship, although none of them provided statistically significant results. No other statistically significant relation between any organochlorines and any food intakes examined was observed in this study.

11834077,"The aim of this work was the optimization of some procedures usually used in the analysis of zearalenone (ZEA) in corn and other cereals by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array and/or fluorescence detection. The comparison of five extraction solvents is presented. Three solid-phase extraction cartridges (C-18, silica, Florisil) and immuno-affinity columns were also compared to obtain the best recovery of the mycotoxin with the minimal presence of co-extractives in the chromatograms. Mixtures of methanol-1% aqueous NaCl (80.20 or 60:40 v/v) were the best extraction solvents. Florisil provided higher recovery of ZEA than C-18, and silica proved unsuitable. The immuno-affinity column was very efficient in cleaning the extracts, but its sample capacity was lower than that of SPE columns due to saturation. The mobile phase (methanol-water 80:20 v/v) gave a low retention time for ZEA (approximately 5 min), high sensitivity and acceptable separation between this mycotoxin and alpha-zearalenol. The optimized protocol is straightforward, provides high ZEA recoveries in spiked corn (mean 102.4%), has an acceptable sensitivity and has a lack of interference with fluorescence detection (detection limit 4 ng ZEA g(-1) corn). The photodiode array detector was useful, except at very low ZEA levels, to confirm the identity of the mycotoxin.

The ratio between the total amount of culmorin compounds and the DON compounds ranged from 0.14 to 1.07 in the samples. This study shows that there is a strong correlation between the amount of DON present in the grain and the amount of culmorin and hydroxy-culmorins present. The ratio of each of the culmorin compounds relative to the amount of DON compounds were in the same range in the grain artificially inoculated by F. culmorum as found in an earlier study for F. culmorum strains cultivated on rice, while the hydroxy-culmorin profile in the naturally contaminated grain was more similar to what was found for the F. graminearum cultures in the same study.

However, an increase in urinary calcium in early renal damage induced by cadmium has been reported both in humans and in animal experiments. To investigate the feasibility of using urinary calcium as a biomarker of renal dysfunction induced by cadmium, two areas were selected in this study, namely, a polluted area with a 3.71 mg/kg cadmium concentration in rice and a control area with a 0.07 mg/kg cadmium concentration. The total number of participants was 499, made up of 252 in the control group and 247 from the cadmium-polluted area. Urinary cadmium, urinary calcium, and zinc concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry, and beta 2-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase in urine were analyzed. The levels of urinary cadmium and urinary calcium in persons from the exposed area were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in the control area for both men and women, but there was no significant difference regarding urinary zinc between the two areas. A significant dose-response relationship between the prevalence of hypercalciuria and the excretion of urinary cadmium was observed, and a significantly increased prevalence of calciuria was found when excretion of urinary cadmium exceeded 2 micrograms/g creatinine. The findings were similar to those for excess urinary secretion of beta 2-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. Because cadmium can affect Ca2+ uptake by tubular cells, with decreased renal Ca2+ reabsorption, calciuria may reflect tubular cell damage caused by cadmium. It was concluded that cadmium exposure can result in increased excretion of urinary calcium in a general population and that there is a significant dose-response relationship.

The current residue definition of dithiocarbamates in food for compliance with maximum residue limits, at national and international levels, is total residues arising from the use of any or each dithiocarbamate fungicide, determined as CS(2). The analytical method most frequently used to analyze dithiocarbamate residues in food for monitoring purposes was proposed more than 30 years ago. In this method, total dithiocarbamates are decomposed to CS(2), which is purified and reacted with a cupric reagent. The yellow complex formed is quantified by spectrophotometry. In this paper, a new reaction system for the purification and complexation of CS(2) is proposed.

When the rice wines were extracted twice with chloroform at 30 degrees C for 60 min, the recovery of ethyl carbamate was less than 16%. When they were saturated with NaCl before extraction, the recovery of ethyl carbamate increased to 24.4% in takju and 67.2% in yakju. Adjustment of pH to 9.0 after NaCl saturation in takju resulted in a dramatic increase of recovery to 81.2%, but not in yakju. When the contents of ethyl carbamate and its precursor, urea, in various Korean traditional rice wines were determined, there was no correlation between the two contents. This is due to the fact that storage time is more important than urea content in the formation of ethyl carbamate in rice wine. In addition, its storage at high temperature resulted in a dramatic increase in ethyl carbamate content according to the prolonged storage time, suggesting that storage time and temperature play a key role in the formation of ethyl carbamate in Korean traditional rice wine.",Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,"['D002273', 'D008401', 'D006863', 'D007723', 'D012275', 'D012965', 'D012997', 'D013696', 'D013997', 'D014508', 'D014520', 'D014920']","['Carcinogens', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Korea', 'Oryza', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Solvents', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Urea', 'Urethane', 'Wine']",An improved method for determination of ethyl carbamate in Korean traditional rice wine.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000494', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'pharmacology', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11571620,2002

M. verrucaria produced large amounts of macrocyclic trichothecenes when cultured on solid rice medium, including epiroridin E (16.8 mg/g crude extract), epiisororidin E (1 mg/g), roridin E (8.7 mg/g), roridin H (31.3 mg/g), trichoverrin A (0.6 mg/g), trichoverrin B (0.1 mg/g), verrucarin A (37.4 mg/g), and verrucarin J (2.2 mg/g). Most of these toxins were also isolated from M. verrucaria spores and mycelia grown on potato dextrose agar medium, including epiroridin E (32.3 mg/g), epiisororidin E (28.6 mg/g), roridin E (0 mg/g), roridin H (60 mg/g), trichoverrin A (1.3 mg/g), trichoverrin B (1.8 mg/g), verrucarin A (13.8 mg/g), and verrucarin J (131 mg/g). When M. verrucaria was cultured on liquid media, the numbers but not the amounts of toxins decreased. Only epiroridin E (28.3 mg/g), epiisororidin E (29.6 mg/g), verrucarin B (195 mg/g) and verrucarin J (52.6 mg/g) were measured when the fungus was cultured on cornsteep medium. On soyflour-cornmeal broth M. verrucaria produced several toxins, including epiroridin E (58.1 mg/g), epiisororidin E (5.8 mg/g), verrucarin B (29.9 mg/g) and verrucarin J (32 mg/g). In contrast, no macrocyclic trichothecenes were detected by HPLC analysis of plant tissues of kudzu, sicklepod, and soybean treated with aqueous suspensions of M. verrucaria spores formulated with a surfactant. Chloroform-methanol extracts of kudzu leaves and stems treated with M. verrucaria spores were less cytotoxic to four cultured mammalian cell lines than the corresponding extracts from control plants. Purified macrocyclic trichothecenes (verrucarin A and T-2 toxin) were very cytotoxic to the same cell lines (< or = 2 ng/ml). These results show that neither intact macrocyclic trichothecenes nor toxic metabolites could be detected in plant tissues after treatment with M. verrucaria spores. These results argue for both safety and efficacy for the use of M. verrucaria in biological control of kudzu and other noxious weeds, and support proceeding to animal feeding trials for further evaluation of safety.",Phytochemistry,"['D001203', 'D002460', 'D002851', 'D010572', 'D029908', 'D014255']","['Ascomycota', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Pest Control, Biological', 'Pueraria', 'Trichothecenes']",Macrocyclic trichothecenes are undetectable in kudzu (Pueraria montana) plants treated with a high-producing isolate of Myrothecium verrucaria.,"['Q000472', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['pathogenicity', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11551550,2001

Based on this chelation, a highly sensitive spectrofluorimetric method was developed for the determination of trace amounts of lead in a water-ethanol (5 + 1, v/v) medium at pH = 9.4. Under these conditions, the Pb-HNAAQ complex has excitation and emission maxima at 398 and 450 nm, respectively. The linear range of the method is from 0 to 100 microg l(-1) and detection limit is 0.28 microg l(-1) of lead. Interference of other ions was studied. In strongly basic media most interfering metal ions form precipitates of hydroxides or oxides and can be removed efficiently through filtration while the residual cations can be removed with a cation-exchange resin. Hence, the selectivity of the method can be increased considerably. The procedure can easily be performed and affords good precision and accuracy.

11452511,"Follow-up survey of the blood concentration of PCDDs, PCDFs and non-ortho-chlorine substituted PCBs in Yusho patients is very important for their health control. We determined the blood concentration of these dioxin isomers in 119 blood samples collected in 1998 and 1999 using by a high-resolution gas chromatograph/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). Thirty years had passed since the Yusho occurrence, and the total blood concentrations of PCDFs in the blood of Yusho patients were still as high as ever, except the patients with the PCB pattern C. Among the different groups of PCB patterns, the concentration of 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF and 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF showed significant differences, excluding the group BC because of the small number of cases. The findings indicate that these isomers are not decomposed in human body since they had highly contaminated the causal rice oil at the onset. In typical Yusho patients (Group A of PCB pattern), the mean TEQ concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs and non-ortho-chlorine substituted PCBs in the blood collected in 1998 were 21, 206, and 14 pg-TEQ/g lipid, respectively, and in 1999, 30, 308 and 14 pg-TEQ/g lipid, respectively. The toxic contribution rate of PCDFs TEQ was still at high levels for total TEQ in both years. The patients of the group C, however, the mean blood levels of the dioxins TEQ in 1998 and 1999 did not differ from those of the normal controls determined in 1996 although some patients in this group showed a high toxic contribution rate of PCDFs TEQ for total TEQ.

11445894,"The measurement of the carbon isotope composition of starch and cellulose still relies on chemical isolation of these water-insoluble plant constituents and subsequent elemental analysis by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS) of the purified fractions, while delta(13)C values of low-molecular-weight organic compounds are now routinely measured by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS). Here we report a simple and reliable method for processing milligram quantities of dried plant material for the analysis of the carbon isotope composition of lipids, soluble sugars, starch and cellulose from the same sample. We evaluated three different starch preparation methods, namely (1) enzymatic hydrolysis by alpha-amylase, (2) solubilization by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) followed by precipitation with ethanol, and (3) partial hydrolysis by HCl followed by precipitation of the resulting dextrins by ethanol. Starch recovery for three commercially available native starches (from potato, rice and wheat) varied from 48 to 81% for the techniques based on precipitation, whereas the enzymatic technique exhibited yields between 99 and 105%. In addition, the DMSO and HCl techniques introduced a significant (13)C fractionation of up to 1.9 per thousand, while the carbon isotope composition of native starches analyzed after enzymatic digestion did not show any significant difference from that of untreated samples. The enzymatic starch preparation method was then incorporated into a protocol for determination of delta(13)C signatures of lipids, soluble carbohydrates, starch and crude cellulose. The procedure is based on methanol/chloroform/water extraction of dried and ground leaf material. After recovery of the chloroform phase (lipid fraction), the methanol/water phase was deionized by ion exchange (soluble carbohydrate fraction) and the pellet treated with heat-stable alpha-amylase (starch fraction). The remaining insoluble material was subjected to solvolysis by diglyme (cellulose fraction). The method was shown to be applicable to foliar tissues of a variety of different plant species (spruce, erect brome, maize and soybean).",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D002244', 'D002247', 'D002482', 'D004121', 'D006851', 'D006868', 'D008055', 'D013058', 'D018515', 'D013213', 'D000516']","['Carbon', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Cellulose', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Hydrochloric Acid', 'Hydrolysis', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Plant Leaves', 'Starch', 'alpha-Amylases']",Preparation of starch and other carbon fractions from higher plant leaves for stable carbon isotope analysis.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000378']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11445894,2001

The phthalate esters were as follows: diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, dipentyl, dihexyl, butylbenzyl, dicyclohexyl, di(2-ethylhexyl), dioctyl, diisooctyl (mixture of isomers) and diisononyl (mixture). Di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate was also determined. Sixteen packed lunches and ten set lunches were analysed, and in all samples the concentration of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was the highest, at 0.80-11.8 mg/kg in packed lunches and 0.012-0.30 mg/kg in set lunches. The DEHP content of five packed lunches exceeded 1.85 mg, which is the EU tolerable daily intake (TDI) for a person of 50 kg body weight. Foodstuffs that were components of the packed lunches were taken from the factory at each step of preparation and phthalates were determined. For example, chicken contained 0.08 mg/kg DEHP when uncooked, 13.1 mg/kg after frying and 16.9 mg/kg after packing. Disposable PVC gloves used in the preparation of foods were apparently the source of high DEHP concentrations. The gloves used during cooking or packaging were sprayed with 68% (w/w) ethanol to sterilize them. PVC gloves from the factory contained 22 or 41% by weight of DEHP.

From 6 medical centers in Taiwan, we included 456 patients in maintenance HD for more than 4 months for this study, and they had continued the previously mentioned medications for at least 3 months. Blood samples were collected before initiating HD, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry was used to measure plasma levels of Cu, Zn, and Al as well as whole blood levels of Pb, Cd, and Hg. Three hundred seventy-five (78%) of the HD patients had low plasma Zn levels, that is, <800 microg/L, and the mean (+/-SD) concentration was 705.8 (+/-128.23) microg/L in all subjects. One hundred forty-one (31%) of the HD patients had high plasma Al, that is, >50 microg/L, and the mean (+/-SD) was 44.30 (+/-28.28) microg/L in all subjects. Three hundred thirty-three (73%) of the dialysis patients had high Cd levels, that is, >2.5 microg/L, and the mean (+/-SD) was 3.32 (+/-1.49) microg/L in all subjects. The majority of HD patients had normal blood levels of Cu, PB, and Hg. Only 21 (4. 6%), 5 (1.1%), and 3 (0.06%) patients had elevated blood levels of Cu, Pb, and Hg, respectively. Their mean (+/-SD) blood concentration of Cu, Pb, and Hg were 1,049.78 (+/-233.25) microg/L, 7.45 (+/-3.95) microg/dL, and 3.17 (+/-25.56) microg/L, respectively. Three patients had elevated plasma Hg concentrations, that is, 546, 12.6, and 24.0 microg/L, respectively. In the 152 normal healthy age and sex matched control group, the blood levels of Al, Cd, and Pb were all significantly lower than the HD patients. However, the levels of Cu and Zn were higher in the control group. The Hg level was not significantly different in both groups. There was no statistical difference between patients with normal and abnormal blood levels of trace metals in various medications except Al containing phosphate binder. The Al containing phosphate binder users had significantly higher plasma Al levels (54.71 +/- 26.70 versus 41.15 +/- 28.03 microg/L, p < 0.001) and hematocrit levels (29.61 +/- 4.61 versus 27. 81 +/- 3.91, p < 0.0005). There was no statistical correlation between erythropoietin (EPO) dose and hematocrit level in these patients. In conclusion, the blood level of trace metals of these HD patients except Al was not related to their medications. However, caution must be exercised in interpreting this result as dose and duration of medication; efficiency of HD and water treatment may play an important role. Otherwise, environmental factors, diet, and the aging process may contribute to the trace metal burden in uremia.

10939848,A method for simultaneous determination of 17 organochlorine and 9 pyrethroid pesticides in agricultural products by capillary GC with ECD detection was studies. The samples were extracted with acetone under acidic conditions followed by Florisil column clean-up and then injected into a GC-ECD. The organochlorine pesticides used in this study included unstable captan and captafol in the homogenized preparations of fruits and vegetables. Captan and captafol were also found to decompose in rice and wheat samples when the samples were allowed to stand after the addition of water. Addition of phosphoric acid to the samples was effective in preventing the decomposition of captan and captafol. Recovery of the pesticides investigated in this study was not decreased by the addition of phosphoric acid. Addition of phosphoric acid was also effective in removing interfering substances from onion extract. Recovery of organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticides from samples spiked at levels of 0.05-0.25 ppm by the proposed method was 51.4-100.8% for rice and wheat and 60.1-119.0% for vegetables.,Kokuritsu Iyakuhin Shokuhin Eisei Kenkyujo hokoku = Bulletin of National Institute of Health Sciences,"['D002849', 'D018556', 'D004563', 'D005506', 'D007306', 'D010573', 'D011722']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'Electrochemistry', 'Food Contamination', 'Insecticides', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Pyrethrins']",[Studies on simultaneous determination of 17 organochlorine and 9 pyrethroid pesticides of agricultural products].,"['Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['methods', None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10939848,2000

Investigations were conducted to determine if these toxins were present in macroconidia of the pathogen prior to inoculating barley spikelets. Extracts of macroconidia cultured from mung bean agar were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Neither DON or 15-ADON was detected in three isolates' macroconidia when compared with macroconidia-DON-matrix standards adjusted to 100, 200, 300, and 400 ng/g with a detection limit of 100 ng/g. Mean recovery of DON that was added to macroconidia was 89.5%. The same isolates were pathogenic on barley cultivars Robust (moderately susceptible) and Chevron (moderately resistant) and produced DON (0 to 3.69 ng/g) and 15-ADON (detected but not quantified) when grown in rice culture. Greenhouse experiments were performed to determine when DON and 15-ADON were detectable after inoculation and to quantify their amount in inoculated barley spikelets. The three isolates of F. graminearum were separately inoculated to a central spikelet on heads of barley cultivars Robust and Chevron. Both toxins were detected in spikelets 48 h postinoculation (PI). DON increased dramatically after 72 h and did not diminish thereafter. Accumulation of 15-ADON peaked at 72 to 120 h and decreased by 240 h PI. There were no statistical differences between cultivars or among fungal isolates for accumulation of either toxin when averaged over the time intervals. Differences of toxin accumulation at each sampling interval were significant (P < 0.0001) when averaged over isolates and cultivars. Spikelets of six cultivars and lines were sampled at inoculation and 18, 36, 54, 72, and 90 h PI. DON and 15-ADON were detected at 36 h PI, but differences among the cultivars and lines were not significant. Yield of DON in inoculated spikelets of 31 barley cultivars and lines at 72 h PI ranged from 0.14 to 1.26 μg per spikelet, and differences among the cultivars and lines were significant (P < 0.002). The data demonstrate a useful range of variability for toxin accumulation in inoculated spikelets among germ plasm in the Minnesota breeding program. Macroconidia with no detectable DON or 15-ADON could be used for in vitro studies of toxin biosynthesis. Establishing when DON and 15-ADON are synthesized facilitates studying the effects of promising fungicides, biocontrol organisms, and new or novel genetic resistance mechanisms and if or how they may prevent or delay the biosynthesis of toxins.",Plant disease,[],[],Biosynthesis of Deoxynivalenol in Spikelets of Barley Inoculated with Macroconidia of Fusarium graminearum.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30841106,2019

In the present study, fluorescence and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry were employed to determine the mechanism of modification of NCp7 by two lead compounds, N-[2-(5-pyridiniovaleroylthio)benzoyl]sulfacetamide bromide and N-[2-(5-pyridiniovaleroylthio)benzoyl]-4-(4-nitrophenylsulfonyl )anili ne bromide (compounds 45 and 47, respectively). Although both compounds exhibit antiviral activity in cell-based assays, we failed to detect appreciable ejection of zinc from NCp7 under conditions in which previously described NCp7-active disulfides readily eject zinc. However, upon ""activation"" by Ag(+), compound 45 reacted with NCp7 resulting in the zinc ejection from both zinc fingers. The reaction followed a two-step mechanism in which zinc was ejected from the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger faster than from the amino-terminal zinc finger. Both compounds covalently modified the protein with pyridinioalkanoyl groups. Compound 45 modified cysteines 36 and 49 of the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger. The results obtained herein demonstrate that PATE compounds can be constructed that selectively target only one of the two zinc fingers of NCp7, thus providing an impetus to pursue development of highly selective zinc finger inhibitors.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D000595', 'D019380', 'D002213', 'D036022', 'D015683', 'D015497', 'D006801', 'D007700', 'D013058', 'D008969', 'D011487', 'D011726', 'D011994', 'D018629', 'D013409', 'D013450', 'D014764', 'D015032', 'D016335', 'D054301']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Capsid', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Gene Products, gag', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Pyridinium Compounds', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Sulfacetamide', 'Sulfones', 'Viral Proteins', 'Zinc', 'Zinc Fingers', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",Inactivation of HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein P7 by pyridinioalkanoyl thioesters.

The enzyme specifically cleaves the phosphodiester bond at the 3' side of the apurinic site introduced by ribosome-inactivating proteins into the sarcin/ricin domain of 28S rRNA. The 3' and 5' ends of wheat 28S rRNA at the cleavage site are 5'-GUACG-alpha-hydroxy-alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde and pGAGGA-3', demonstrating that the enzyme catalyzes a beta-elimination reaction. The substrate specificity of the enzyme is extremely high: it acts only at the apurinic site in the sarcin/ricin domain of intact ribosomes, not on deproteinized rRNA or DNA containing apurinic sites. The amino acid sequences of five endopeptidase LysC-liberated peptides from the purified enzyme were determined and used to obtain a cDNA sequence. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 456 amino acids, and a homology search revealed a related rice protein.

Concentrations of inorganic arsenic in food have not been not well characterized. Accurate dietary intake estimates for inorganic arsenic are needed to support studies of arsenic's status as an essential nutrient, and to establish background levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic. In the market basket survey reported here, 40 commodities anticipated to provide at least 90% of dietary inorganic arsenic intake were identified. Four samples of each commodity were collected. Total arsenic was analysed using an NaOH digestion and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Separate aliquots were analysed for arsenic species using an HCl digestion and hydride atomic absorption spectroscopy. Consistent with earlier studies, total arsenic concentrations (all concentrations reported as elemental arsenic per tissue wet weight) were highest in the seafoods sampled (ranging from 160 ng/g in freshwater fish to 2360 ng/g in saltwater fish). In contrast, average inorganic arsenic in seafood ranged from less than 1 ng/g to 2 ng/g. The highest inorganic arsenic values were found in raw rice (74 ng/g), followed by flour (11 ng/g), grape juice (9 ng/g) and cooked spinach (6 ng/g).

Two major endopeptidases, named WEP-1 and WEP-2, were present in the 50-70% saturated ammonium sulfate fraction of d-3 seedlings, and could be separated by hydrophobic column chromatography. WEP-1 was further purified and identified as a 31-kDa polypeptide that was immunoreactive to antiserum raised against REP-1, a major rice cysteine endopeptidase. Experiments with proteinase inhibitors revealed that WEP-1 and WEP-2 are cysteine and serine endopeptidases, respectively. The two enzymes differed in substrate specificity, pH dependence, and the ability to digest major wheat seed proteins. Determination of its amino-terminal amino acid sequence indicated the similarity of WEP-1 to other cereal cysteine endopeptidases which are involved in the digestion of seed storage proteins. The expression of WEP-1 in de-embryonated seeds was induced in the presence of gibberellic acid and its effect was eliminated by abscisic acid.

Among the cereals, Pb contents were higher in foxtail millet (54.3 ng/g) and lower in maize (35.4 ng Pb/g; grain and flour in combination), wheat flour (28.8 ng Pb/g) and rice flour (22.7 ng Pb/g). Lead levels in two important types of pulses, kidney bean and soybean (24.6 and 30.8 ng Pb/g, respectively), were comparable to the levels in rice and wheat. In contrast, Cd levels were substantially higher in pulses (55.7 ng Cd/g) than in cereals (9.2 ng Cd/g), and among the pulses, Cd in soybean (55.7 ng Cd/g) was significantly higher than that in kidney bean (23.8 ng Cd/g).

In addition, they offered raw (uncooked) rice as well as wheat flour and maize starch from the kitchen. Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in food duplicates and blood samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after homogenization (when necessary) and wet-ashing. The consumption of rice, wheat and maize was calculated by weighing each food item in the duplicates taking advantage of the food composition tables. The dietary exposure level of the women was 11 micrograms Pb/day and 14 micrograms Cd/day, and the levels of Pb and Cd in their blood were 37 ng Pb/ml and 0.47 ng Cd/ml.

Rice accounted for 18 and 21% of dietary Pb and Cd intake, respectively and cereals (i.e. rice, wheat and maize in combination) accounted for 24% both for Pb and Cd. The calculation from the published data on air quality in Manila suggested that another and yet a greater source of Pb burden was Pb in atmospheric air which may account for 85% of total Pb uptake, whereas the amount of Cd in air was quite small (i.e. < 10% of the total uptake).",The Science of the total environment,"['D000328', 'D000367', 'D002104', 'D003625', 'D002523', 'D004781', 'D005260', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D007854', 'D013058', 'D012275', 'D010679']","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cadmium', 'Data Collection', 'Edible Grain', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Lead', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oryza', 'Philippines']","Non-occupational exposure of adult women in Manila, the Philippines, to lead and cadmium.","[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9599459,1998
9546170,"Of the toxins produced by Bacillus cereus, the emetic toxin is likely the most dangerous but, due to the lack of a suitable assay, the least well known. In this paper, a new, sensitive, inexpensive, and rapid bioassay for detection of the emetic toxin of B. cereus is described. The assay is based on the loss of motility of boar spermatozoa upon 24 h of exposure to extracts of emetic B. cereus strains or contaminated food. The paralyzed spermatozoa exhibited swollen mitochondria, but no depletion of cellular ATP or damage to plasma membrane integrity was observed. Analysis of the purified toxin by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry showed that it was a dodecadepsipeptide with a mass fragmentation pattern similar to that described for cereulide. The 50% effective concentration of the purified toxin to boar spermatozoa was 0.5 ng of purified toxin ml of extended boar semen-1. This amount corresponds to 10(4) to 10(5) CFU of B. cereus cells. No toxicity was detected for 27 other B. cereus strains up to 10(8) CFU ml-1. The detection limit for food was 3 g of rice containing 10(6) to 10(7) CFU of emetic B. cereus per gram. Effects similar to those provoked by emetic B. cereus toxin were also induced in boar spermatozoa by valinomycin and gramicidin at 2 and 3 ng ml of extended boar semen-1, respectively. The symptoms provoked by the toxin in spermatozoa indicated that B. cereus emetic toxin was acting as a membrane channel-forming ionophore, damaging mitochondria and blocking the oxidative phosphorylation required for the motility of boar spermatozoa.",Applied and environmental microbiology,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D001409', 'D001427', 'D001681', 'D005069', 'D005516', 'D005517', 'D006801', 'D066298', 'D007476', 'D008297', 'D008854', 'D008928', 'D008969', 'D010455', 'D012680', 'D013081', 'D013094', 'D013552', 'D014839']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bacillus cereus', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Biological Assay', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Food Microbiology', 'Foodborne Diseases', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Ionophores', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sperm Motility', 'Spermatozoa', 'Swine', 'Vomiting']",A novel sensitive bioassay for detection of Bacillus cereus emetic toxin and related depsipeptide ionophores.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000209', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000209']","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'etiology', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'drug effects', None, 'analysis', None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, 'etiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9546170,1998

8763161,"Four alpha-amylase inhibitors, WRP24, WRP25, WRP26, and WRP27, were purified from wheat flour by preparative, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. All have polypeptide molecular masses of about 14 kDa and are members of the cereal superfamily of protease and alpha-amylase inhibitors. Sedimentation velocity analysis indicated that WRP25 and WRP27 are monomeric proteins, whereas WRP24 is a dimer. WRP24 is identical in N-terminal amino acid sequence to the well characterized 0.19 dimeric inhibitor from wheat kernels. WRP25 and WRP26 differ in sequence from each other at only three positions and represent previously unseparated forms of the 0.28 wheat inhibitor. WRP27 is a previously uncharacterized inhibitor and is more similar in sequence to the 0.28 inhibitor than to the 0.19 inhibitor. WRP25 and WRP26 inhibited alpha-amylases from the rice weevil, red flour beetle, and the yellow meal worm, but did not inhibit human salivary alpha-amylase. WRP24 inhibited the human as well as the insect alpha-amylases, but inhibited one of the two rice weevil alpha-amylases much more strongly than the other. WRP27 was notable in that, of the enzymes tested, it strongly inhibited only the rice weevil alpha-amylases. We observed that the growth rate of red flour beetle larvae was slowed when purified WRP24 was included in the diet at a level of 10%. Addition of WRP24 to corn starch resulted in greater weight loss of red flour beetle adults than occurred on control diets.

These materials were slowly roasted under a powdered oure at less than 60 degrees C and fermented with Aspergillus oryzae over 3 days to transform each ingredient into low molecular weight substances. These conditions were different by each material, environmental humidity and temperature. It probably contains a variety of substances having antioxidant activity including flavonoids, alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, and tannins. We investigated its antioxidative properties using electron spin resonance (ESR) and autoxidation of rat brain homogenates. The superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and the stable free radical, diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of AOB was investigated using ESR spectrometry. In an in vitro study, a suspension of AOB was added directly to a superoxide generating system (hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase; HX/XO) and investigated using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trapping agent. At final concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/ml, AOB dose-dependent scavenging activity was observed as 0.103, 0.619, and 1.369 U/ml, respectively. A concentration of 1.0 mg/ml completely scavenged DMPO-OOH signals; 1.0 mg/ml of AOB inhibited the DMPO-OH signal generated by Fenton's reaction, but its inhibitory effect was not competitive, and was inhibition of the Fenton's reaction. 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/ml of AOB were significantly inhibited the DPPH radical. In an in vivo study, rats were fed AOB orally at doses of 1 or 5 g/day for 24 h or for 3 days and the superoxide scavenging activity was measured in plasma. With the administration of 1 g/day for 3 days, the superoxide scavenging activity was about 1.8 times that of the control group fed a basal diet; 1.5 times the control with 5 g/day for 1 day, and 2.6 times the control with 5 g/day for 3 days, all of which represented significant increases in superoxide scavenging activity. AOB strongly inhibited the autoxidation of rat brain homogenates in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. However, each ingredient before roast and fermentation little inhibited lipid peroxidation. Roasting and fermentation with A. oryzae way be important to transform each ingredient into low molecular weight substances. Therefore, it was suggested that AOB possesses strong antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities.",Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,"['D000818', 'D000975', 'D001921', 'D002523', 'D004578', 'D005285', 'D016166', 'D017665', 'D019271', 'D007042', 'D015227', 'D008297', 'D010084', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D013025', 'D013113', 'D013481', 'D013662', 'D017392', 'D014969']","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Brain', 'Edible Grain', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Fermentation', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Soybeans', 'Spin Labels', 'Superoxides', 'Tea', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances', 'Xanthine Oxidase']",Antioxidative effects of a processed grain food.,"[None, 'Q000494', 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7891207,1995

They are assumed to be formed from hydroxymethyl-glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Ser) and are termed hydroxymethyl-phytochelatins (hm-PCs) in analogy to the homo-phytochelatins [(gamma-Glu-Cys)n-beta-Ala], discovered in legumes, and the phytochelatins [PCs, (gamma-Glu-Cys)n-Gly] found in most other plants and many fungi. The hm-PCs were isolated from the roots of cadmium-exposed rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Strella), and their structure was confirmed by amino acid analysis after total and enzymic hydrolysis and by tandem mass spectrometry. The hm-PCs probably play a significant role in heavy metal detoxication in rice. In addition to this new form of gamma-Glu-Cys (gamma EC) peptide, PCs and gamma EC peptides without C-terminal Ser or Gly are found. All gamma EC peptides are synthesized without delay after incubation of rice plants in 100 microM CdCl2 in the roots as well as in the shoots.

The possible implications of element concentrations to animal and human health are considered for the Deog-Pyoung area.Geochemical surveys have been undertaken within 13 river tributary valleys in the area underlain by uraniferous black shales and black slates or grey chlorite schists. Sampling of rocks, soils and plants has been carried out along transect lines within each valley. Samples were analysed for trace elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) and for uranium by Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA). Soil pH, cation exchange capacity, loss on ignition and particle size distribution have been measured for selected samples.Average trace element concentrations of the Okchon uraniferous black shales were 6.3 μg g(-1) Cd, 136 μg g(-1) Mo and 8.6 μg g(-1) Se. Soils derived from these rocks tend to reflect their extreme geochemical composition. Trace element concentrations in alluvial soils derived in part from these black shales averaged 1.2 μg g(-1) Cd, 20 μg g(-1) Mo and 1.5 μg g(-1) Se. Trace element concentrations in plants were found to be influenced by those of soils. Cadmium accumulated in tobacco leaves up to 46 μg g(-1) (D.M.) and leafy plants such as lettuce contain up to 0.5 μg g(-1) Se (D.M.).In addition to total concentrations in soils, soil pH is a major factor influencing uptake of Mo into crop plants and soil texture for Se. Concentrations of trace elements in plants also varied between plant species. The relative concentrations of Cd were found to vary in the order tobacco > lettuce > red pepper > rice grain.Elevated concentrations of Cd in crop plants and in tobacco may possibly have deleterious effects on human health in this area.

Foods 1-4 were fortified with ferrous sulfate, and food 5 was fortified with ferrous fumarate. Blood was obtained at ages 140, 168, and 196 d of age, and the test meal was fed under standardized conditions at 154 d of age. Erythrocyte incorporation of the 58Fe label was determined from the increase in the mass isotope ratio, 58Fe/57Fe, from the baseline value (at 140 d of age) to the follow-up values. The mass isotope ratio was determined by inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Geometric mean total iron incorporation into erythrocytes from the test meal of MJEBF fortified with ferrous sulfate (food 2) was 0.05 mg, and from the vegetable-beef product test meal (food 3) was 0.08 mg. The low value for MJEBF is presumably explained by the low level of iron fortification. The low value for the vegetable-beef product may reflect the presence of inhibitors of iron absorption. Geometric mean erythrocyte incorporations of iron from the test meals with foods 1, 4 and 5 were 0.15, 0.14, and 0.18 mg, respectively.

Milled grain of cultivars Lemont and Texmati had a soluble sugar content of 0.21 and 0.35% (w/w), respectively, on a fresh weight basis. The dorsal portion of the milled grain contained the greatest amount of soluble sugar, approximately tenfold the amount found in the central core of the grain. Extracts of the milled grain contained sucrose-phosphate synthase (EC 2.4.1.14) and sucrose synthase (EC 2.4.1.13) activities, which were separated by anion exchange chromatography.

A reliable analytical method for the quantitative determination of citreoviridin in corn and rice is described. Corn or rice is extracted with dichloromethane, and the extract is partially purified on silica and amino solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns. The extract is analyzed for citreoviridin by normal-phase liquid chromatography, using a mobile phase of ethyl acetate-hexane (75 + 25) at 1.5 mL/min and a fluorescence detector to measure the yellow fluorescence (388 nm excitation, 480 nm emission). With a 100 microL injection loop, the relationship between concentration and injection volume is linear for 20-60 microL injections. Recoveries of citreoviridin added to yellow corn at 10-50 ng/g were 91.0-96.9%; recoveries from white corn (10-50 ng/g added) were 96.8-102.8%. Recoveries of 5000 ng/g added to white corn were 89.0%, indicating that heavily contaminated samples can be assayed by the method. Minimum detection limits were 10 ng for citreoviridin standard and 2 ng/g for citreoviridin added to corn.

3709459,"Chemical forms of heavy metals such as Cd, Cu, Ni, and Pb in rice and wheat plants grown in nutrient solution containing a heavy metal were investigated. Fractionation of an extract of Cd-treated rice plants on Sephadex G-75 showed cadmium to be associated with organic compounds of high (fraction A), intermediary (fraction B), and low molecular weight (fraction C). Material A, whose molecular weight was greater than 440,000, is probably nonspecific binding of Cd to normal cell components. Materials B and C can be classified as types of metallothionein. The molecular weight of B was 33,100. This material contains 12 mg Cd/g protein. The UV-absorption spectrum of B showed absorptions at 280 and 250 nm. Material B was not eluted even at a very high ionic strength from the DEAE-cellulose column, but it was eluted at a very low ionic strength from a CM-cellulose column, indicating a highly anionic molecule which differs from metallothionein in animals. Fraction C contains two materials: one a Cd-containing material whose molecular weight was estimated to be approximately 7000 and the other an inorganic Cd salt. In addition to cadmium, copper, lead, and nickel in rice and wheat have been studied. As a result, heavy metal-containing materials whose molecular weights were estimated to be approximately 16,000 and 8900 (Ni-treated rice plants), 7000 (Pb-treated rice plants), 5000 (Cd-treated wheat plants), and 21,000 (Cu-treated wheat plants) were isolated.",Environmental health perspectives,"['D002104', 'D003300', 'D007854', 'D008668', 'D008970', 'D009532', 'D012275', 'D010940', 'D013056', 'D014908']","['Cadmium', 'Copper', 'Lead', 'Metallothionein', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nickel', 'Oryza', 'Plant Proteins', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Triticum']",Chemical form of cadmium (and other heavy metals) in rice and wheat plants.,"['Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3709459,1986

3936066,"The chemistry and molecular biology of DNA adducts is only one part of the carcinogenic process. Many other factors will determine whether a particular chemical will exert a carcinogenic effect. For example, the size of particles upon which a carcinogenic may be adsorbed will influence whether or not, and if so where, deposition within the lung will occur. The simultaneous exposure to several different agents may enhance or inhibit the metabolism of a chemical to its ultimate carcinogenic form (Rice et al., 1984; Smolarek and Baird, 1984). The ultimate carcinogenic metabolites may be influenced in their ability to react with DNA by a number of factors such as internal levels of detoxifying enzymes, the presence of other metabolic intermediates such as glutathione with which they could react either enzymatically or non-enzymatically, and the state of DNA which is probably most heavily influenced by whether or not the cell is undergoing replication or particular sequences being expressed. Replicating forks have been shown to be more extensively modified than other areas of DNA. Another critical factor which can influence the final outcome of the DNA damage is whether or not the modifications can be repaired. If this occurs with high fidelity and the cell has not previously undergone replication then the effect of the damage by the carcinogen is likely to be minimal. The major area in which progress is needed is an understanding of what this damage really does to the cell such that after an additional period of time, which may be as long as twenty or more years, these prior events are expressed and cell proliferation occurs. Clearly additional stimulatory factors, for example tumor promoting agents such as the phorbol esters or phenobarbital, are often needed. After such prolonged periods it seems likely that the DNA adducts would no longer be present. However, the way in which their earlier presence is remembered is not clear. Simple mutations do not explain all the characteristics of tumor progression and, when it occurs, regression. Even if a specific site mutation does occur then its expression must be under other types of control. Any explanation of the action of DNA modification at the molecular level also requires that account be taken of the diverse nature of the DNA adducts from simple modifications such as methylation to bulkier adducts such as benzo[a]pyrene, aflatoxin or aromatic amines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Pharmacology & therapeutics,"['D015112', 'D000348', 'D000477', 'D000818', 'D001551', 'D001564', 'D001570', 'D001711', 'D002273', 'D055598', 'D002621', 'D002911', 'D004247', 'D004261', 'D004852', 'D005449', 'D011564', 'D006801', 'D007158', 'D007553', 'D016685', 'D008937', 'D009281', 'D010087', 'D010984', 'D011721', 'D012451', 'D013050']","['4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide', 'Aflatoxins', 'Alkylating Agents', 'Animals', 'Benz(a)Anthracenes', 'Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Benzodiazepinones', 'Biotransformation', 'Carcinogens', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chrysenes', 'DNA', 'DNA Replication', 'Epoxy Compounds', 'Fluorenes', 'Furocoumarins', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins', 'Naphthalenes', 'Oxides', 'Platinum', 'Pyrenes', 'Safrole', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",DNA modification by chemical carcinogens.,"['Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', 'Q000145', None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000276', 'Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', None]","['pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', None, 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', 'classification', None, None, 'pharmacology', 'immunology', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', None, None, 'methods', None, 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3936066,1986

It was shown that the use of immuno-concentration followed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or immunoassay can regularly detect aflatoxins down to pg/ml in fluids including urine. Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in free form was identified as the major metabolite in urine suitable for use as an approximate dosimetric indicator of recent exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). A panel of monoclonal antibodies of IgG class were developed in the murine system against AFB1 and/or AFM1. Their affinity constants are at the level of 10(8)-10(9) L/mol, and they are suitable for use in either effective immuno-concentration or in high sensitivity immunoassays.

Additional interferences were cleaned up on an activated charcoal chromatographic column, and organophosphorus pesticides adsorbed on the activated charcoal were eluted with acetone-hexane. Dimethoate is not retained on the activated charcoal and must be extracted with dichloromethane from the first acetonitrile-water eluate.

The second Florisil eluates of both Aroclors 1242 and 1248 induced AHH activity, whereas these eluates of both Aroclors 1254 and 1260 did not.

The procedure utilized was the batch adsorption of enterotoxin from the cell-free culture supernatant by CG-50 ion exchange resin at pH 5.6. The enterotoxin was eluted by various concentrations of elution solution with different pH values. The lyophilized eluate was dissolved in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) solution and analyzed with a quantitative double diffusion method. The desorption of enterotoxin from ion exchange resin appeared to be less effective by increasing the concentration of elution solution than by elevating the pH value of elution solution. The pH below 6.2 seemed to lose the ability to elute the enterotoxin from ion exchanger but enough to elimate non-specific extra proteins.
