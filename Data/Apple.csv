35243353,"Flubendiamide (FBD) is the first commercially available phthalic acid diamide that targets ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in insects, which play a major role in lepidoptera control. However, excessive use of FBD can influence the quality of treated products leading to toxic effects on human health. The availability of rapid and convenient methods for evaluating FBD amount in the environment is necessary. Therefore, analytical methods were developed for the determination of residues of FBD and its metabolite desiodo in different food matrices like tomato, cabbage, pigeon pea, apple, chilli and rice. The current review carries forward methods for FBD residues analysis in foods by using several chromatographic techniques including sample preparation steps. The comparison between the different methods employed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of food quality and safety is also discussed. Liquid chromatography (LC) is the predominant analytical method for assessing the quality of foods treated with FBD. Studies related to LC coupled multichannel detector (Ultraviolet (UV), Mass spectrometry (MS)) are also applied to detect pesticide residues. Extraction and clean up steps are essential to obtain reliable results.

35215355,"Apples are known to be a rich source of phenolic compounds, however detailed studies about their content in the individual parts of apple trees are reported rarely. For this purpose, we tested various stationary phases for the determination of phenolic compounds in leaves, bark, and buds. Phloridzin, phloretin, chlorogenic acid, rutin, and quercitrin were analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection. A YMC Triart C18-ExRS 150 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle size analytical column with multilayered particle technology was used. The separation was performed with a mobile phase that consisted of acetonitrile and 0.1% phosphoric acid, according to the gradient program, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min for 12.50 min. The concentration of phenolic compounds from 13 cultivars was in the range of 64.89-106.01 mg/g of dry weight (DW) in leaves, 70.81-113.18 mg/g DW in bark, and 100.68-139.61 mg/g DW in buds. Phloridzin was a major compound. The total antioxidant activity was measured using flow analysis and the correlation with the total amount of phenolic compounds was found. This finding can lead to the re-use of apple tree material to isolate substances that can be utilized in the food, pharmaceutical, or cosmetics industries.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],"Determination of Phloridzin and Other Phenolic Compounds in Apple Tree Leaves, Bark, and Buds Using Liquid Chromatography with Multilayered Column Technology and Evaluation of the Total Antioxidant Activity.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35215355,2022
35182922,"In order to prepare a kind of efficient fluorescence sensors for determination of cis-diol-containing flavonoids, novel imprinted quantum dots for myricetin (Myr) were prepared based on boronate affinity-based template-immobilization surface imprinting. The obtained boronate affinity-based surface imprinted silica (imprinted APBA-functionalized CdTe QDs) was used as recognition elements. The quantum dots were used as signal-transduction materials. Under the optimum conditions, according to fluorescence quenching of imprinted APBA-functionalized CdTe QDs by Myr, the imprinting factor (IF) for Myr was evaluated to be 7.88. The result indicated that the boronate affinity functionalized quantum dots coated with imprinted silica were successfully prepared. The prepared imprinted APBA-functionalized CdTe QDs exhibited good sensitivity and selectivity for Myr. The fluorescence intensity was inversely proportional to the concentration of Myr in the 0.30-40 μM concentration range. And its detection limit was obtained to be 0.08 μM. Using the fluorescence sensors, the detection of Myr in real samples was successfully carried out, and the concentration of Myr in green tea and apple juice samples was evaluated to be 2.26 mg/g and 0.73 mg/g, respectively. The recoveries for the spiked green tea and apple juice samples were 95.2-105.0% and 91.5-111.0%, respectively.

35150386,"Patulin (PAT) is a natural contaminant of fruits (primarily apples) and their products. Significantly, high levels of contamination have been found in fruit juices all over the world. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated PAT's ability to alter intestinal structure and function. However, in real life, the probability of low dose long-term exposure to PAT to humans is significantly higher through contaminated food items. Thus, in the present study, we have exposed normal intestinal cells to non-toxic levels of PAT for 16 weeks and observed that PAT had the ability to cause cancer-like properties in normal intestinal epithelial cells after chronic exposure. Here, our results showed that chronic exposure to low doses of PAT caused enhanced proliferation, migration and invasion ability, and the capability to grow in soft agar (anchorage independence). Moreover, an in vivo study showed the appearance of colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACFs) in PAT-exposed Wistar rats, which are well, establish markers for early colon cancer.

Although several methods have been developed using a wide range of analytical techniques, most of them require sample destruction and do not allow in situ sampling or analysis, nor reliable quantification of hundreds of molecules at the same time. To overcome these limitations, we have developed and validated a new noninvasive analytical workflow for food authentication. The method uses a functionalized strip to adsorb small molecules from the surface of the food product, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the desorbed analytes. We validated the method and applied it to the classification of five different apple varieties. Molecular concentrations obtained from the analysis of 44 apples were used to identify markers for apple cultivars or, in combination with machine learning techniques, to perform cultivar classification. The overall reproducibility of the method was very good, showing a good coefficient of variation for both targeted and untargeted analysis. The approach was able to correctly classify all samples. In addition, the method was also used to detect pesticides and the following molecules were found in almost all samples: chlorpyrifos-methyl, deltamethrin, and malathion.

34999933,"The incidence of patulin (PAT) in fruit products is a worldwide concern due to its acute and chronic toxic effects. Therefore, accurate and reliable PAT measurements are important for preventing consumer health risks. Our previous method, which was based on a common technique that uses ethyl acetate extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with isotope dilution (ID-LC-MS/MS), has shown great performance for the determination of PAT in apple products. However, prolonged extraction times and multistep clean-up processes were required to sufficiently eliminate the matrix interferences. Herein, a feasible alternative ID-LC-MS/MS method was successfully established, employing simplified and reliable sample preparation steps. The clean-up process was performed using molecularly imprinted polymer-solid-phase extraction (MIP-SPE) cartridges, which eliminated matrix interferences and facilitated the trace quantification. While the previous method used a multimode LC column for the retention of polar patulin, the current method used a UPLC HSS T3 column, which further improved the peak sharpness and reduced the run time. The method was validated by measuring fortified samples in the concentration range of 5‒100 µg/kg. The accuracy varied between 97.8 and 102.0%, with relative standard deviation for interday and intraday precision being below 3%. The measurement uncertainty was lower than 4% (at a 95% level of confidence). Therefore, this method demonstrated adequate metrological quality with greatly enhanced performance over various reported methods.

The targeted and untargeted principal component analysis (PCA) analyses showed complementary and corroborative results from the cashew apple volatile composition based on genotype. The partial least squares (PLS) modeling revealed the high correlation of the unpleasant sensory attributes with the PRO805 and CAPI17 clones; sweet taste and sweet odor with the CCP76 clone; and cashew aroma/cashew flavor with the EMBRAPA51, HAC276, PRO555, and SLC12.20 clones. The correlation between the most relevant volatile organic compounds (VOC) for cashew apples and the sensory descriptors showed that the compounds methyl butanoate, methyl 3-methylbutanoate, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, methyl 2-butenoate, methyl 3-methylpentanoate, 3-carene, methyl (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoate, ethyl 4-methylpentanoate, 2-hexenal, butyl 3-methylbutanoate, butyl pentanoate, and 3-methyl butanoic acid were important to explain differences in the characteristic fruit aroma and flavor of cashew apples among the studied clones. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Cashew crops have been developed by using improved clones with increased nut productivity and resistance to diseases. The Brazilian genetic improvement program is also seeking to improve the quality of peduncles to maximize their use and prevent their destination as agricultural waste. In this study, the volatile profile of peduncles of seven cashew clones was determined and its correlation with the differences in their aroma and flavor attributes established. The results will provide important information about the potential of the new materials for fresh consumption and for the manufacturing of cashew juices, in addition to be used by breeders interested in improving the aroma of the fruit.",Journal of food science,"['D031021', 'D000090022', 'D002999', 'D000069600', 'D055549']","['Anacardium', 'Chemometrics', 'Clone Cells', 'Plant Breeding', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Chemometric analysis of the volatile profile in peduncles of cashew clones and its correlation with sensory attributes.,"[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34778966,2021

Slices of mold-infected and uninfected (control) apples and strawberries were prepared, and this was the only sample preparation step used. An infrared laser beam (2.94 μm) was used to irradiate the slices, resulting in the ablation of sample compounds directly ionized by electrospray and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Multivariate curve resolution - alternating least squares was applied in unfolded LAESI images to obtain relative quantity information. Patulin was not detected in the control samples but was seen in all mold-infected fruits. LAESI images showed the diffusion of patulin from the rotten area to unaffected parts of the fruits.

Herein, a liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) multi-mycotoxin method was developed and applied to investigate the effect of technological unit operations on the fate of three of the most relevant mycotoxins along the processing chain for cloudy and clear apple juice, namely patulin (PAT), ochratoxin A (OTA), and alternariol (AOH). Raw juice obtained directly after dejuicing was spiked with the aforementioned mycotoxins at pilot-plant scale prior to subjecting it to different technological unit operations. Regarding clear apple juice production treatment with a pectinolytic enzyme preparation, and pasteurization were insignificant for mycotoxin reduction, but fining with subsequent filtration was effective, although the mycotoxins showed different affinity towards the tested agents. The most effective fining agent was activated charcoal/bentonite in combination with ultrafiltration, which removed OTA (54 µg/L) and AOH (79 µg/L) to not quantifiable amounts (limit of quantification (LOQ) 1.4 and 4.6 µg/L, respectively), while PAT was reduced only by 20% (from 396 to 318 µg/L). Regarding cloudy apple juice production, all studied processing steps such as centrifugation and pasteurization were ineffective in reducing mycotoxin levels.

Apple pomace is a multifunctional phenolic compound possessing effective biological activity against cervical cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate the anticancer effects of quercetin-3-glucoside (Q3G) extracted from apple pomace in HeLa cell lines and analyze its molecular mechanisms. High-performance liquid chromatography revealed that Q3G, coumaric acid, phloridzin, quercetin, and phloretin are the major polyphenolic compounds constituting apple pomace. Among them, Q3G possessed the greatest antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and exhibited significant cytotoxic effects in HeLa cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that Q3G induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase in a time-dependent manner by altering cyclin-dependent kinase 2. Moreover, it induced apoptosis via chromosomal DNA degradation and increased reactive oxygen species generation. Furthermore, Q3G treatment altered the apoptosis-associated protein expression in the cells by activating caspase-9/-3, downregulating anti-apoptosis protein B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 expressions and up regulating the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein. BH3-interacting domain death agonist cleavage occurred prior to the degradation of an anti-apoptotic Mu-2-related death-inducing gene involved in cell death signaling.

These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) attract natural enemies of the herbivores and repel or attract conspecific adult herbivores in a tri-trophic interaction which has been considered to be an indirect plant defense against herbivores. Recently, we demonstrated the attraction of male and female European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) to a blend of phenylacetonitrile and acetic acid, two compounds identified as HIPVs in heterospecific apple-leafroller interactions.

Thus, this work was undertaken to investigate HIPVs in the grapevine-leafroller interaction and study the response of heterospecific adults L. botrana, to these volatiles. We collected headspace volatiles emitted from uninfested grapevines and grapevines infested with larvae of a generalist herbivore, the grapevine leafroller moth, Sparganothis pilleriana (Denis & Schiffermüller), and analyzed them using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Infested grape leaves released three compounds (phenylacetonitrile, indole, and 2-phenylethanol) not found from uninfested leaves. Nine different blends, comprising a full factorial set of the three compounds with each blend containing acetic acid, were tested in a field-cage trial. Only lures containing phenylacetonitrile caused a significant increase in trap catches compared to the other lures and blank traps.

34392532,"Red-fleshedapples are preferredbecause of their high content of phenolics and antioxidants in peel and pulp. Herein, we evaluated the mechanisms of apple peel polyphenolic extracts (APP) and apple flesh polyphenolic extracts (AFP) from the new red-fleshed apple in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The antiproliferative activities were determined by the CCK8 assay. The expression of proteins was determined using Western blot. We found that the content of polyphenols and flavonoids in APP was significantly higher than that in AFP, and 14 main phenolic compounds in APP and AFP were quantified using UPLC-MS/MS techniques. Besides, the significant inhibition effects of APP and AFP were achieved through Akt pathway by inducing apoptosis (significantly upregulating reactive oxygen species [ROS] levels, and downregulating expression of pAkt, pBad, Bcl-2, promoting Cytochrome c release, activating Cle-Caspase 9, and inducing expressions of Cle-Caspase 3 and Cle-PARP), and inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (increased expressions of p-p53 and p21 and decreased expressions of PCNA and Cyclin D1). And the inhibition effect of APP was stronger than that of AFP.

Phloretin, a dihydrochalcone flavonoid that is abundant in apples and pears, has anti-inflammatory effects on ulcerative colitis (UC) mice. The gut microbiota and metabolism are closely related to each other due to the existence of the food-gut axis in the human colon. To investigate the interplay of faecal metabolites and the microbiota in UC mice after phloretin treatment, phloretin (60 mg/kg) was administered by gavage to ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice. Gut microbes and faecal metabolite profiles were detected by high-throughput sequencing and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, respectively. The correlations between gut microbes and their metabolites were evaluated by Spearman correlation coefficients. The results indicated that phloretin reshaped the disturbed faecal metabolite profile in UC mice and improved the metabolic pathways by balancing the composition of faecal metabolites such as norepinephrine, mesalazine, tyrosine, 5-acetyl-2,4-dimethyloxazole, and 6-acetyl-2,3-dihydro-2-(hydroxymethyl)-4(1H)-pyridinone.

By combining picolitre pressure-probe electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (picoPPESI-MS) with freezing point osmometry and vapor pressure osmometry, changes in cell water status and metabolisms were spatially assayed in the same fruit. In the watercored fruit, total soluble solid was lower in the watercore region than the normal outer parenchyma region, but there was no spatial difference in the osmotic potentials determined with freezing point osmometry. Importantly, a disagreement between the osmotic potentials determined with two methods has been observed in the watercore region, indicating the presence of significant volatile compounds in the cellular fluids collected. In the watercored fruit, cell turgor varied across flesh, and a steeper water potential gradient has been established from the normal outer parenchyma region to the watercore region, retaining the potential to transport water to the watercore region. Site-specific analysis using picoPPESI-MS revealed that together with a reduction in turgor, remarkable metabolic modifications through fermentation have occurred at the border, inducing greater production of watercore-related volatile compounds, such as alcohols and esters, compared with other regions. Because alcohols including ethanol have low reflection coefficients, it is very likely that these molecules would have rapidly penetrated membranes to accumulate in apoplast to fill. In addition to the water potential gradient detected here, this would physically contribute to the appearance with high tissue transparency and changes in colour differences. Therefore, it is concluded that these spatial changes in cell water relations are closely associated with watercore symptoms as well as with metabolic alterations.",Horticulture research,[],[],Direct evidence for dynamics of cell heterogeneity in watercored apples: turgor-associated metabolic modifications and within-fruit water potential gradient unveiled by single-cell analyses.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344866,2021

34263869,"The determination and qualification of sugars in fruits are important for quality control and assurance of horticultural produce. The sugars determine the sweetness levels in fruits. The requirement for a universal technique that is also robust to predict the sweetness of the fruit in a non-destructive fashion is immense. The handheld refractometer, hydrometer, electronic tongues, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) in combination with other detectors have long been used to determine the sweetness of horticultural produce. Though these techniques are very accurate and useful, they require extensive sample preparation and are generally time-consuming and expensive. Optical techniques like visible to near-infrared spectroscopy (vis/NIRS) are simple in use and can rapidly predict the sweetness of the fruit in a non-destructive fashion. The instrumentation used in these techniques is simple and cost-effective for routine analysis of the fruits. However, their systems need calibration for each sample, and the measurement variation depends on the type of horticultural produce on which measurements are done. An optical-based technique is proposed that uses reflected phase information of the incident light and correlates the same to the presence of sorbitol concentration in apples. The refractive index of sorbitol varies as the fruit ripens due to its change in concentration, and the reflected phase information accordingly changes.

To find their prey, the pest's natural enemies need to be fine-tuned to the composition of these volatiles. Whereas standard methods can be used in the identification and quantitation of HIPVs, more recently introduced techniques such as PTR-ToF-MS provide temporal patterns of the volatile release and detect additional compounds. In this study, we compared the volatile profile of apple trees infested with two aphid species, the green apple aphid Aphis pomi, and the rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea, by CLSA-GC-MS complemented by PTR-ToF-MS. Compounds commonly released in conjunction with both species include nonanal, decanal, methyl salicylate, geranyl acetone, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenyl butanoate, (Z)-3-hexenyl 2-methyl-butanoate, (E)-β-caryophyllene, β-bourbonene and (Z)-3-hexenyl benzoate.

The study covered 370 samples of fruits and vegetables including apples, pears, grapes, raspberries, strawberries, cranberries, as well as beetroots, celeries, carrots and tomatoes. The content of Cd and Pb was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Quantitative results were analyzed using statistical models: analysis of variance, outlier analysis, post-hoc multiple comparison Tukey test. The tests showed that the levels of Cd and Pb concentration in samples of fresh, processed, frozen and dried fruits and vegetables varied substantially. The highest concentrations were recorded in dried products. Several fruit and vegetable samples exceeded the maximum permissible concentrations of Cd and Pb. The contamination of these products could be a significant source of consumer exposure to heavy metals when these products are a part of the diet.",Scientific reports,[],[],Concentration of cadmium and lead in vegetables and fruits.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099845,2021

The diode-array detection provided the best results regarding sensitivity and selectivity of the developed method in terms of evaluation of phenolics profiles. The response of the charged aerosol detector was negatively affected by co-eluting substances during rapid-screening analyses. Coulometric detection was used for advanced characterization of extracts in terms of antioxidant content and strength to obtain more complex information concerning sample composition.

Herein, we demonstrated gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-immersed paper imprinting mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) for monitoring pesticide migration behaviors in various fruits and vegetables (i.e., apple, cucumber, pepper, plum, carrot, and strawberry). By manually stamping food tissues onto AuNP-immersed paper, this method affords the spatiotemporal visualization of insecticides and fungicides within fruits and vegetables, avoiding tedious and time-consuming sample preparation. Using the established MSI platform, we can track the migration of insecticides and fungicides into the inner region of foods. The results revealed that both the octanol-water partition coefficient of pesticides and water content of garden stuffs could influence the discrepancy in the migration speed of pesticides into food kernels. Taken together, this nanopaper imprinting MSI is poised to be a powerful tool because of its simplicity, rapidity, and easy operation, offering the potential to facilitate further applications in food analysis. Moreover, new perspectives are given to provide guidelines for the rational design of novel pesticide candidates, reducing the risk of food safety issues caused by pesticide residue.","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Spatiotemporal Visualization of Insecticides and Fungicides within Fruits and Vegetables Using Gold Nanoparticle-Immersed Paper Imprinting Mass Spectrometry Imaging.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069856,2021

This study focuses on bioactives of apple cider by-products (ACBPs) with putative cardio-protective properties. Total lipids (TLs) were extracted from ACBPs of apple varieties that are low (ACBP1), medium (ACBP2), and high (ACBP3) in tannins and were further separated into polar lipids (PLs) and neutral lipids (NLs). The functionality of these lipid extracts and of their HPLC-derived lipid fractions/PL subclasses were assessed in vitro against human platelet aggregation induced by the thrombotic and inflammatory platelet agonists platelet-activating factor (PAF) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The fatty acid profile of PLs and their most bioactive lipid fractions were evaluated by GC-MS analysis. The PL extracts exhibited higher specificity against the PAF-induced platelet aggregation compared to their anti-ADP effects, while TL and NL showed lower bioactivities in all ACBPs. HPLC analysis unveiled that the most bioactive PL from all ACBPs were those in PL fraction 3 containing phosphatidylcholines (PCs). PLs from all ACBPs and their PC bioactives were rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and especially in the essential omega-6 (n-6) linoleic acid (LA) and omega-3 (n-3) alpha linolenic acid (ALA), with favorably low values of the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, thus providing a rationale for their higher anti-inflammatory bioactivities.

Increasing evidence indicates that this compound possesses anti-oxidation, anti-aging, and anti-inflammation properties. In this study, isoquercitrin was purified from apple pomace by high-speed countercurrent chromatography and its neuroprotective effect on Parkinson's disease was investigated in MPTP-induced acute mouse models. It was found that isoquercitrin ameliorated the animal behaviors against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity, mitigated the loss of dopamine neurons induced by MPTP, increased tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter expression, reduced the pro-apoptotic signaling molecule bax expression and inhibited MPTP-triggered oxidative stress. Our results demonstrated that isoquercitrin has protective effects on the MPTP subacute model mouse, which might be partially mediated through the actions of anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis.

The gathered analytical data confirmed that the final elemental fingerprint of a product is affected by the elemental fingerprint of the ingredients used (apple variety) as well as the technology and equipment used by the producer, and in the case of commercial ciders, also the impact of type of the packaging used was proven. These factors are specific to each producer and the influence of the mentioned above parameters was revealed as a result of the performed analysis. Additionally, the inclusion of the home-made ciders in the data set helped us to understand the potential origin of some elements, from the raw materials to the final products.

In turn, for different packaging (can or bottle) within one brand of commercial cider, the existence of statistically significant differences for Cu, Mn and Na was proved. The concentrations of all determined elements in the commercial cider from the Polish market and home-made cider samples can be considered as nontoxic, because the measured levels of elements indicated in the regulations were lower than the allowable limits.

33649376,"A novel, integrated, in vitro gastrointestinal (GI) system is presented to study oral bioavailability parameters of small molecules. Three compartments were combined into one hyphenated, flow-through set-up. In the first compartment, a compound was exposed dynamically to enzymatic digestion in three consecutive microreactors, mimicking the processes of the mouth, stomach, and intestine. The resulting solution (chyme) continued to the second compartment, a flow-through barrier model of the intestinal epithelium allowing absorption of the compound and metabolites thereof. The composition of the effluents from the barrier model were analysed either offline by electrospray-ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), or online in the final compartment using chip-based ESI-MS. Two model drugs, omeprazole and verapamil, were used to test the integrated model. Omeprazole was shown to be broken down upon treatment with gastric acid, but reached the cell barrier unharmed when introduced to the system in a manner emulating an enteric-coated formulation. In contrast, verapamil was unaffected by digestion. Finally, a reduced uptake of verapamil was observed when verapamil was introduced to the system dissolved in apple juice, a simple food matrix.

Volatile compounds were identified using the headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). During the fruit ripening, the 'Orin' apple fruit weight, size, and total soluble solid were gradually increased by contrast with the titratable acidity, and the firmness decreased. The content of four soluble sugars reached the maximum at the 180 days after full bloom (DAFB) stage. Malic acid was measured as the most abundant organic acid in 'Orin' apples.

In order to select effective polysaccharides to prevent the haze formation, four protein-polyphenol haze model systems were successfully established using two proteins (i.e., gelatin and bovine serum albumin) and two polyphenols (i.e., procyanidin [PC] and epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG]). Among seven common polysaccharides, 0.5 mg/mL pectin, 0.05 mg/mL xanthan gum, and 0.01 mg/mL guar gum demonstrated the maximum potential for preventing the formation of four protein-polyphenol hazes. Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry confirmed that polysaccharides affected protein-polyphenol interactions. Fluorescence spectrophotometry combined with microscale thermophoresis data indicated the relative affinities of polyphenol to protein and polysaccharide determined the mechanism of polysaccharide for preventing the haze formation. In bovine serum albumin (BSA)/gelatin-EGCG system, polysaccharides (pectin, xanthan gum and guar gum) competed with BSA/gelatin to bind EGCG for prevention the formation of BSA/gelatin-EGCG haze. However, in BSA/gelatin-PC system, polysaccharides (pectin, xanthan gum, and guar gum) formed a ternary complex (protein-tannin-polysaccharide) for increasing the solubility of protein-polyphenol aggregation. From apple juice results, the reduction rates of guar gum in two apple juice systems (gelatin-PC, BSA-PC) were 21% and 56% within 8 weeks, indicating guar gum might be the most effective polysaccharide in preventing the haze formation.

Our results indicate that the digesta had less total phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanins, but more free phenolic acids, than the extracts. An analysis of the in vitro antioxidant capacity (including ABTS radical scavenging activity, DPPH radical-scavenging capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power [FRAP], and cellular antioxidant activity [CAA]) revealed that the digestion decreased the ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP values, but increased the CAA values, relative to the corresponding values for extracts.

In this study, the branch growth phenotypes of three combinations of 'Fuji' apple trees grafted on different rootstocks (VR: Malus baccata; DIR: Malus baccata/T337; DSR: T337) were investigated. The VR trees presented the biggest branch architecture. The results showed that the sugar content, sugar metabolism-related enzyme activities, and hormone content all presented obvious differences in the tender leaves and buds of apple trees grafted on these rootstocks. Transcriptomic profiles of the tender leaves adjacent to the top buds allowed us to identify genes that were potentially involved in signaling pathways that mediate the regulatory mechanisms underlying growth differences. In total, 3610 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through pairwise comparisons. The screened data suggested that sugar metabolism-related genes and complex hormone regulatory networks involved the auxin (IAA), cytokinin (CK), abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) pathways, as well as several transcription factors, participated in the complicated growth induction process.

We used acetylcholinesterase to catalytically convert acetylthiocholine into thiocholine. In turn, by competitive binding to the AgNPs, the produced thiocholine displaces AgNPs from the GQDs and thus induces fluorescence recovery. However, OP analytes inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase and, in so doing, retain the silver-graphene nanoparticle complex and fluorescence quenching. The degree of quenching is proportional to the concentration of OPs; the detection limit is as low as 0.017 μg/L. The ultraviolet-visible absorption of GQDs/AgNPs at 390 nm decreases-because of AgNP aggregation that occurs after desorption from the GQDs-and the absorbance is linearly proportional to the OP concentration.

Residues of metals from this historical use can persist in soil for decades, which can result in potential risk for humans if they consume fruits grown on contaminated soil. This research was conducted to assess lead and arsenic levels in apples, leaves, and orchard soil where the apples were grown to determine the relationship between metal levels in fruits and fruit products with those in orchard soil. Soil and tree tissue samples were collected from several Michigan farms, and metal concentrations were quantified by using microwave extraction and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0 to 20 cm and 20 to 40 cm at a distance of 1 m from the tree trunk. Fruit samples also were processed into juice and pomace fractions to assess the partitioning of arsenic and lead during juice processing. The lead concentration was significantly higher in topsoil (9.4 μg/kg) compared with subsoil (6.9 μg/kg), but the arsenic content did not differ between the two soil layers (P > 0.05). Lead concentrations in apple leaves were correlated with lead in topsoil (0 to 20 cm; P = 0.03).

The effectiveness of flavouring treatments was confirmed by instrumental analysis of volatile compounds profile using solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME/GC-MS) and by discriminative and descriptive sensory analyses. The effect of flavour-impact was evaluated in an informed test on the two flavoured 'Fuji' apples: the consumers were asked to evaluate the global liking of the treated and non-treated apples with information regarding the aromatic features. Participants' additional data on the characteristics on their ""ideal apple"", attitudes toward natural food, food neophobia, and demographic data were also recorded by specific questionnaires.

We used the grape berry moth (GBM; Paralobesia viteana)-grape plant (Vitis spp.) complex as a model for studying the proximate mechanisms of long distance olfactory-mediated, host-plant location and selection by a specialist phytophagous insect. We used flight tunnel assays to observe GBM female in-flight responses to host (V. riparia) and non-host (apple, Malus domestica; and gray dogwood, Cornus racimosa,) odor sources in the form of plant shoots, extracts of shoots, and synthetic blends. Gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses were used to identify antennal-active volatile compounds. All antennal-active compounds found in grape shoots were also present in dogwood and apple shoots. Female GBM flew upwind to host and non-host extracts and synthetic blends at similar levels, suggesting discrimination is not occurring at long distance from the plant. Further, females did not land on sources releasing plant extracts and synthetic blends, suggesting not all landing cues were present. Additionally, mated and unmated moths displayed similar levels of upwind flight responses to all odor sources, supporting the idea that plant volatiles are not functioning solely as ovipositional cues.

In this research, cinnamon essential oil Pickering emulsion (ZCCPEs) stabilized by zein-pectin composite nanoparticles (ZCPs) was constructed as an effective antimicrobial system. Thereafter, the influence of ZCPs concentration on the stability of ZCCPEs was studied. The results showed that 0.25% ZCPs could reduce the bioorganic matter by four times compared with 1% ZCPs while maintaining good physical stability. The inhibitory effect of ZCCPEs on two food-related microorganisms (i.e. Alternaria alternata and Botrytis cinerea) was evaluated by antimicrobial assay. In addition, two fresh-cut apple slices models were constructed to systematically evaluate the application potential of ZCCPEs in food preservation. Due to the well dispersibility and sustained-release ability, ZCCPEs showed superior antibacterial performance than pure essential oil.

The automated extraction procedure involved the aspiration of aqueous sample into a syringe pump with homogeneous mixture of extraction solvent (1-oсtanol) and deep eutectic solvent (tetrabutylammonium bromide - formic acid) containing color-forming reagent (1,5-diphenylcarbazide). This led to decomposition of deep eutectic solvent in aqueous phase resulting in dispersion of extraction solvent, oxidation of 1,5-diphenylcarbazide to 1,5- diphenylcarbazone in the presence of chromium (VI), and formation of colored chromium (III) complex with 1,5-diphenylcarbazone and its fast extraction.

31436867,"Terpenes are important compounds in plant trophic interactions. A meta-analysis of GC-MS data from a diverse range of apple (Malus × domestica) genotypes revealed that apple fruit produces a range of terpene volatiles, with the predominant terpene being the acyclic branched sesquiterpene (E,E)-α-farnesene. Four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for α-farnesene production in ripe fruit were identified in a segregating 'Royal Gala' (RG) × 'Granny Smith' (GS) population with one major QTL on linkage group 10 co-locating with the MdAFS1 (α-farnesene synthase-1) gene. Three of the four QTLs were derived from the GS parent, which was consistent with GC-MS analysis of headspace and solvent-extracted terpenes showing that cold-treated GS apples produced higher levels of (E,E)-α-farnesene than RG. Transgenic RG fruit downregulated for MdAFS1 expression produced significantly lower levels of (E,E)-α-farnesene. To evaluate the role of (E,E)-α-farnesene in fungal pathogenesis, MdAFS1 RNA interference transgenic fruit and RG controls were inoculated with three important apple post-harvest pathogens [Colletotrichum acutatum, Penicillium expansum and Neofabraea alba (synonym Phlyctema vagabunda)]. From results obtained over four seasons, we demonstrate that reduced (E,E)-α-farnesene is associated with decreased disease initiation rates of all three pathogens. In each case, the infection rate was significantly reduced 7 days post-inoculation, although the size of successful lesions was comparable with infections on control fruit.

Using in situ immunolocalization and size exclusion epitope detection chromatography, distinct cell type differences in cell wall composition in the exocarp were revealed during apple fruit development. Epidermal cell walls lacked pectic (1→4)-β-d-galactan (associated with rigidity), whereas linear (1→5)-α-l-arabinan (associated with flexibility) was exclusively present in the epidermal cell walls in expanding fruit and then appeared in all cell types during ripening. Branched (1→5)-α-l-arabinan was uniformly distributed between cell types. Laser capture microdissection and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were used to explore transcriptomic differences controlling cell type-specific wall modification. The RNA-seq data indicate that the control of cell wall composition is achieved through cell-specific gene expression of hydrolases. In epidermal cells, this results in the degradation of galactan side chains by possibly five β-galactosidases (BGAL2, BGAL7, BGAL10, BGAL11, and BGAL103) and debranching of arabinans by α-arabinofuranosidases AF1 and AF2.

Principal component analysis showed large differences in aroma components and sensory characteristics, including odd peculiar odors and flavors such as apricot and peach, and very different levels of phenolic compounds, acids and sugars among the analyzed juices. Moreover, we observed a tendency for late-season juices to be characterized by higher °Brix values, sugar content and they were perceived to be sweeter and more flavor intense than early-season juices.

Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of apple juice samples, we identified 49 fruit volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Recently, it is still employed as racemic mixtures without distinction of the enantiomers, which may lead to an incomplete risk assessment. Here, we analyzed the stereoselective degradation of difenoconazole in apple fruits and open-field soil using an HPLC-UV system. Different trends were established in various apple varieties under identical environmental conditions. No significant differences were found in its enantioselectivity of the degradation processes applied in the field soil of an apple orchard. However, preferential dissipation of (2R,4R)-difenoconazole and (2R,4S)-difenoconazole was observed in Hanfu and Fuji apples, resulting in the enrichment of stereoisomers of (2S,4S)-difenoconazole and (2S,4R)-difenoconazole.

Therefore, it is of paramount importance to evaluate newly developed sources for their suitability to analyze food contaminants like pesticide residues. Here, we carried out a head-to-head comparison of key extraction and analytical performance parameters of an electrospray ionization (ESI) source with a new atmospheric pressure ionization source, UniSpray (US). The two interfaces were evaluated in three matrices of different properties (coffee, apple, and water) to determine if multiresidue analysis of 81 pesticides by QuEChERS extraction and LC-MS/MS analysis could be improved. Depending on the matrix and irrespective of the chemical class, US provided a tremendous gain in signal intensity (22- to 32-fold in peak area, 6- to 7-fold in peak height), a threefold to fourfold increase in signal-to-noise ratio, a mild gain in the range of compounds that can be quantified, and up to twofold improvement of recovery. UniSpray offered comparable linearity and precision of the analyses with ESI, and did not affect the ion ratio. A gain in sensitivity of many compounds was observed with US, but in general, the two ionization interfaces did not show significant difference in LOD and LOQ. UniSpray suffered less signal suppression; the matrix effect was in average 3 to 4 times more pronounced, but showed better values than ESI.

Our study focused on the chemical degradation of PAT in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) both for pure PAT standard in acidified aqueous solution and for PAT-contaminated cloudy apple juice (CAJ) (obtained via addition of apple mash produced from apples inoculated with Penicillium expansum). Within this framework, different concentrations of AA were evaluated, as well as the presence/absence of oxygen and different storage temperatures. In order to do so, an in-house methodology allowing a good separation of PAT from its reaction and breakdown products was optimized first. The highest PAT reduction (60%) in CAJ with an initial PAT concentration of 100 μg/kg and 0.25% (w/v) AA was achieved after 6 days of incubation at 22 °C in the presence of oxygen. It was also found that the treatment by AA resulted in the generation of degradation products less toxic than PAT (such as (E/Z)-ASC). In conclusion, AA used to improve numerous product quality aspects (e.g. colour (less browning), nutritional value, etc.) and considered as a safe food additive (Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (1999)) has an effect on PAT degradation. It was shown that such degradation generated less toxic compounds in the presence of oxygen.

Based on these findings, new insights into the synthesis of ZnO NPs using apple phytochemicals were presented. The photoluminescent properties, characterized by steady-state and time resolve photoluminescence measurements, revealed that besides the intense sharp near-UV band edge emission observed for all particles, with sub-nanosecond lifetime, a strong broad emission band peak at 2.20 eV was detected for microparticles, with longer decay times being associate to crystal defects. Additionally, the photoluminescent properties of ZnO particles, further explored by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), suggested adequacy for imaging applications. The cytotoxicity, evaluated in human dermal fibroblasts, proving the biosafety of ZnO NPs by an unaffected cellular viability, total mitochondrial activity and F-actin cytoskeleton organization, contrasted with some degree of cytotoxicity depicted for microparticles.

Moreover, with regard to partial least squares regression (PLSR), fruity, sour and green notes attribute covaried well with five sensors of e-nose.

30993530,"Metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic acid hydroxy stearic acid (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi). Our study proves the importance of overall FAHFA analysis in food (especially in a functional food), because of their potential metabolic benefits and possible future incorporation in special diets.","Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)","['D000893', 'D004952', 'D005227', 'D005504', 'D055951', 'D006801', 'D007328', 'D008055', 'D013058', 'D024821', 'D010944']","['Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Esters', 'Fatty Acids', 'Food Analysis', 'Functional Food', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Plants']",Analysis of Fatty Acid Esters of Hydroxyl Fatty Acid in Selected Plant Food.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000178', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, 'diet therapy', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993530,2019

30889479,"Proanthocyanidins (PAs) from plants are a nutritionally valuable component of the human diet and play important roles in defense against pests and diseases. PAs are products of the flavonoid pathway, which also leads to the production of anthocyanins and flavonols. The enzymes leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) are involved in PA biosynthesis. The PA biosynthetic pathway has been characterized in several plant species, but the relationship between its expression and PA accumulation in Malus crabapple remains unclear. Here, we cloned the LAR genes MrLAR1, 2, and the ANR genes MrANR1, 2, from the red leaved Malus crabapple cultivar 'Royalty'. The contents of PAs and the expression levels of the LAR and ANR genes were investigated in different organs of the two crabapple cultivars. The transcript levels of two LAR genes and two ANR genes correlated with the contents of the catechin and epicatechin, which are proanthocyanidin precursors. Over-expression of the MrLAR1, 2 and MrANR1, 2 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) promoted the accumulation of PAs, while transient silencing of their expression in crabapple resulted in reduced PA levels. In addition, a negative correlation between quercetin, anthocyanin, and PA biosynthesis was also found during crabapple leaf and fruit peel development. We also found that MrLAR1 and 2 may contribute to epicatechin biosynthesis. In summary, the LAR and ANR genes are critical factors in PA biosynthesis, and there is competition between the quercetin, anthocyanin, and PA biosynthetic pathways during leaf and fruit peel development in Malus crabapple.",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,"['D000872', 'D002392', 'D002851', 'D003001', 'D020869', 'D017343', 'D027845', 'D053858', 'D009247', 'D010940', 'D030821', 'D044945', 'D060888', 'D017422', 'D014026']","['Anthocyanins', 'Catechin', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Plant', 'Malus', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tobacco']",Identification of leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase genes involved in proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in Malus crabapple plants.,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000201', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000096', None, None, None]","['metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'genetics', 'enzymology', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30889479,2019

A monitoring programme for dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs)) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) was conducted in the Polish feed market between 2004 and 2017. Using two complementary ISO 17025-accredited analytical methods (bioassay and high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS)), 2919 samples of plant, animal and minerals origin were analysed. The total number of samples exceeding the maximum limit (ML) was 52, which is 1.8% of all tested samples. They all contained PCDD/Fs in concentrations over the ML, and in 16 samples the limit for the sum of PCDD/F/DL-PCBs was also exceeded. The highest dioxins level was found in feedstuffs derived from Baltic fish; the fish oil was followed by fish meal. Low-chlorinated furans (2.3,7,8 TCDF, 2,3,4,7,8-PCDF and 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF) were dominant and these congeners accounted for the toxicity expressed in WHO toxic equivalents (WHO-TEQ). In this category, 155 out of the 498 samples (32%) exceeded the action threshold (AT) for PCDD/Fs and in 10 samples (2.0%) for DL-PCBs. Non-compliant fish meals were found in 34 (5.6%) of the tested samples, in 0.7% of compound feeds, and in 1.5% of plant-origin materials. Seven dried plant-derived materials contained PCDD/F level above ML, including alfalfa, maize, apple, basil and beet pulp pellets containing molasses. The dry vegetable materials were mostly contaminated by the 2,3,7,8-furans, the congeners arising from a faulty drying process. No significant time trend can be seen. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that concentrations of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in Polish feed materials were sufficiently low to ensure low concentrations in animal-derived products.","Food additives & contaminants.

The matrix effect ranged from -0.05 to 146.14%, depending on matrix type and pesticide. The highest response variation was observed in extracts of Granny Smith-an enhancement in flesh and suppression in peel extract. With the dilution, the matrix effect decreased with different magnitudes, but for Granny Smith peel extract an inverted effect was observed. The presence of the matrix effect in GC-MS pesticides analysis was obvious, requiring the application of matrix-matched calibration in quantification procedures for each variety, with calibration standards matched by the matrix concentration.","Journal of environmental science and health.

PAs were also evaluated in commercial juice and in the juice made in the laboratory by pressing fresh arils. Pomegranate PAs were composed of a very rich mixture of flavan-3-ols: catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and epicatechin gallate. Catechins and gallocatechins were the most abundant units, while galloylated flavanols were detected at lower concentrations. The highest PA content was found in husk (1840.5 μg/g), followed by seeds (316.2 μg/g) and membranes (51.4 μg/g). With regard to the pomegranate edible parts, arils showed concentrations of 34.4 μg/g and pressed aril juice of 21.3 mg/L, lower than those found in other traditional PA-containing food and beverages, such as apple, grapes, chocolate, red wine, or tea.

The degradation leads to the toxic metabolite chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO). The analytical techniques used for the CPS and CPO analysis, like UPLC-PDA and GC-MS, are accurate but also expensive and time consuming, and they need sample pretreatment. In the search of a more rapid and simple analytical procedure, atmospheric solids analysis probe with mass spectrometry (ASAP-MS) was optimized for the determination of CPS and CPO in apples (Malus domestica ""Idared""). The identification of the analytes was based on protonated ion and isotopic pattern, while the quantification was based on peak intensities. The obtained results were confirmed by re-validated UPLC-PDA and GC-MS techniques. CPS and CPO concentrations determined by ASAP-MS and UPLC-PDA showed moderate discrepancies (on average by 10-20%), thus demonstrating that ASAP-MS can be a semiquantitative tool for the quantification of these compounds. As additional goal of this work, the efficiency of a gamma irradiation treatment to remove CPS and CPO from apples was tested by analyzing their content before and after the irradiation: 89-99% of CPS and CPO were degraded with doses of 3.5-3.8 kGy and 66-72 h of irradiation per sample.

In order to understand the mechanisms involved in scab resistance, we performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolomics analysis of the cell culture of scab resistant cultivar 'Florina' and scab susceptible cultivar 'Vista Bella' both prior -to and -following treatment with V. inaequalis elicitor (VIE). A total 21 metabolites were identified to be altered significantly in 'Florina' cell cultures upon VIE-treatment. Among 21 metabolites, formation of three new specialized metabolites aucuparin, noraucuparin and eriobofuran were observed only in resistant cultivar 'Florina' after the elicitor treatment. The score plots of principal component analysis (PCA) exhibited clear discrimination between untreated and VIE-treated samples. The alteration in metabolite levels correlated well with the changes in the transcript levels of selected secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes. Aucuparin, noraucuparin and eriobofuran isolated from the 'Florina' cultures showed significant inhibitory effect on the conidial germination of V. inaequalis.

The perfect chiral separation of the enantiomers was achieved on a Chiralpak IG column within 47 min by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, which is a significant improvement to resolve a large group of chiral compounds under one set of conditions. The method was validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, sensitivity, trueness and precision, which all satisfy the requirement for pesticides residue analysis.

Untreated juice samples for each patulin concentration served as controls under the same experimental conditions. Patulin content was determined with high performance liquid chromatography. The best degradation was observed with 250 μg mL-1 of SO2 at 30 °C regardless of the patulin baseline concentration. Although treatment with SO2 and refrigeration did not fully remove patulin, it was highly efficient over twelve weeks of storage.

Here we studied the nutrikinetics of apple polyphenols by UHPLC-HRMS metabolite fingerprinting, comparing bioavailability when consumed in a natural or a polyphenol-enriched cloudy apple juice. Twelve men and women participated in an acute single blind controlled crossover study in which they consumed 250 mL of cloudy apple juice (CAJ), Crispy Pink apple variety, or 250 mL of the same juice enriched with 750 mg of an apple polyphenol extract (PAJ). Plasma and whole blood were collected at time 0, 1, 2, 3 and 5 h. Urine was collected at time 0 and 0-2, 2-5, 5-8, and 8-24 h after juice consumption. Faecal samples were collected from each individual during the study for 16S rRNA gene profiling. As many as 110 metabolites were significantly elevated following intake of polyphenol enriched cloudy apple juice, with large inter-individual variations. The comparison of the average area under the curve of circulating metabolites in plasma and in urine of volunteers consuming either the CAJ or the PAJ demonstrated a stable metabotype, suggesting that an increase in polyphenol concentration in fruit does not limit their bioavailability upon ingestion. Faecal bacteria were correlated with specific microbial catabolites derived from apple polyphenols. Human metabolism of apple polyphenols is a co-metabolic process between human encoded activities and those of our resident microbiota.

30105623,"Thermally labile pesticides (captafol, captan, dicofol, and folpet) are highly prone to suffer thermal degradation during sample introduction into a gas chromatograph (GC) to tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI), 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone (DCBP), and phthalimide (PI), respectively, mainly produced in the glass liner of the injector. This undesired behavior leads to inaccurate qualitative and quantitative results. Direct on-column injection (OCI) technique is evaluated as an alternative to avoid or minimize compound alteration during the analysis. This configuration was studied and evaluated for the determination of this group of thermally troublesome pesticides. The OCI inlet was operated in ""track oven"" temperature and connected to a wide-bore deactivated guard column that is itself connected to a capillary GC analytical column. This technique has demonstrated to be useful for avoiding degradation generated in the hot inlet. Limitations observed for OCI in routine analysis were injection volume, guard column length, and maintenance issues. Analytical standards spiked in vegetable solutions were injected in OCI, not observing any thermal degradation rate. On the contrary, classical splitless injection (SLI) produced high degradation rates in all cases. This OCI approach was validated in citrate QuEChERS extracts of tomato, apple, and orange matrices for these four compounds and their corresponding transformation products (THPI, DCBP, and PI), evaluating recoveries, repeatability, linearity, and matrix effect. This set-up enabled the correct identification and quantitation for most compounds at LOQs of 0.010 mg/kg in fruit and vegetable samples.

In combination with popular cultivars, we identified a total of 100 compounds in all table grapes, of which 26 key volatiles were correlated with consumer liking. Based on this relationship, five aroma combinations (AC) were formulated, wherein 33 compounds contributed to aroma intensity, and thus, were viewed as active volatiles. The fruity, floral, and sweet aromas were further divided into secondary aromatic series, of which the apple, citrus, orange, rose, geranium, violet, and honey aromas constituted the predominant series in unfamiliar cultivars. Xiangyue and Heikuixiang emerged as the preferred table grapes according to our analysis.

However, in markets, adulteration of berry fruit juice with cheaper substitutes is frequent. In the present study, a metabolomic approach for authentication of berry fruit juices by liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) was established. The global characterization of the berry fruit metabolome by information dependent acquisition directed LC-MS/MS coupled to a peak mining workflow by isotope pattern matching was reported. Targeted metabolomics analysis of known juice biomarkers, such as flavonoids, anthocyanins, etc. exhibited a good separation of berry fruit juices from adulterant juices. Moreover, untargeted metabolomics analysis was carried out and subjected to chemometrics analysis. Discrimination of blueberry juice, cranberry juice, and its adulterant apple juice and grape juice was obtained by principal component analysis-discriminant analysis. Eighteen characteristic markers discriminating berry fruit juice and its adulterants were selected by comparison of marker abundances in different juice samples. Identification of characteristic markers was accomplished by elemental formula prediction and online database searches based on accurate MS information.

29923080,"A new blend of volatiles was identified for the fruit of downy red hawthorn, Crataegus mollis, that is attractive to Rhagoletis pomonella flies infesting this host in the northeastern USA. The new blend was as attractive as the previously identified mixture but is more complex in the number of odorants (six in the old versus ten in the new) and differs significantly in the ratio of three volatiles, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, butyl hexanoate, and dihydro-β-ionone, that are common to both blends and exerted agonist or antagonist effects on behavior in a flight tunnel assay. However, behavioral results with the old and new northern hawthorn blends, as well as modified blends with substituted ratios of 3-methylbutan-1-ol, butyl hexanoate, dihydro-β-ionone, indicated that the 'agonist' or 'antagonist' effects of these volatiles depended on the ratio, or balance of compounds within the blend.

This finding supports the hypothesis that in addition to providing specificity to the odor blends of the northern and southern hawthorn populations, the presence of the significant amounts of ester compounds in the new northern hawthorn blend might have provided a source of standing variation that could help explain the shift in host preference by C. mollis-infesting flies to introduced apple in the mid-1800's.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000818', 'D057506', 'D001522', 'D027825', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D006790', 'D027845', 'D009511', 'D012903', 'D033621', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Arthropod Antennae', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Crataegus', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Malus', 'New England', 'Smell', 'Tephritidae', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']","Identification of a New Blend of Host Fruit Volatiles from Red Downy Hawthorn, Crataegus mollis, Attractive to Rhagoletis pomonella Flies from the Northeastern United States.","[None, 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000032']","[None, 'physiology', 'physiology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'physiology', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29923080,2019

The fabricated fibers were then tested by a headspace-SPME method and a dip-SPME method, followed by SERS detection of fonofos in water and apple juice samples. Using the headspace-SPME method, we can detect as low as 5 ppb of fonofos in water and apple juice, compared with the dip-SPME method, which cannot detect lower than 10 ppb in water and 50 ppb in apple juice.

29855747,"Soil temperature is known to affect plant growth and productivity. In this study we found that low root-zone temperature (LRT) inhibited the growth of apple (Malus baccata Borkh.) seedlings. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of LRT response, we performed comparative proteome analysis of the apple roots under LRT for 6 days. Total proteins of roots were extracted and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and 29 differentially accumulated proteins were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. They were involved in protein transport/processing/degradation (21%), glycometabolism (20%), response to stress (14%), oxidoreductase activity (14%), protein binding (7%), RNA metabolism (7%), amino acid biosynthesis (3%) and others (14%). The results revealed that LRT inhibited glycometabolism and RNA metabolism. The up-regulated proteins which were associated with oxidoreductase activity, protein metabolism and defense response, might be involved in protection mechanisms against LRT stress in the apple seedlings. Subsequently, 8 proteins were selected for the mRNA quantification analysis, and we found 6 of them were consistently regulated between protein and mRNA levels. In addition, the enzyme activities in ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle were determined, and APX activity was increased and GR activity was decreased under LRT, in consistent with the protein levels.

A pattern recognition technique named partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to classify apple cultivars based on resistance to RAA, resistant and susceptible, reaching scores with accuracy higher than 97% and 91% respectively. Hydroxycinnamic acids, particularly 4-caffeoylquinic acid (4-CQA) and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acid (4-pCoQA), were identified as the major player in RAA resistance by the PLS-DA model. Indeed, the isomerisation 5-CQA → 4-CQA is favoured in resistant cultivars, whereas the isomerisation 5-pCoQA → 4-pCoQA is favoured in susceptible cultivars. As a result, resistant cultivars accumulate higher amounts of 4-CQA than susceptible ones, and the opposite occurs for 4-pCoQA. Also, minor isomerisations of 5-CQA to 1-CQA or 3-CQA show opposite behaviour for resistant and susceptible cultivars.

In this study, visible⁻near-infrared spectrometry-based reflectance spectral data (350⁻2500 nm) were acquired from 2014, 2015 and 2016 harvest produce after 63 days of storage at 5 °C. Selected spectral features from 2014 season were used to classify the healthy and bitter pit samples from three years. In addition, these spectral features were also validated using hyperspectral imagery data collected on 2016 harvest produce after storage in a commercial storage facility for 5 months. The hyperspectral images were captured from either sides of apples in the range of 550⁻1700 nm. These images were analyzed to extract additional set of spectral features that were effective in bitter pit detection. Based on these features, an automated spatial data analysis algorithm was developed to detect bitter pit points. The pit area was extracted, and logistic regression was used to define the categorizing threshold. This method was able to classify the healthy and bitter pit apples with an accuracy of 85%.

29752875,"Antagonistic yeasts suppress plant pathogenic fungi by various mechanisms, but their biocontrol efficacy also depends on the ability to compete and persist in the environment. The goal of the work presented here was to quantify the composition of synthetic yeast communities in order to determine the competitiveness of different species and identify promising candidates for plant protection. For this purpose, colony counting of distinct species and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; MALDI biotyping) were used to distinguish different yeast species and to quantify the composition of a synthetic community of six yeasts (Aureobasidium pullulans, Candida subhashii, Cyberlindnera sargentensis, Hanseniaspora sp., Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Pichia kluyveri) over time, on apples and in soil, and in different growth media. These studies revealed important characteristics that predispose the different species for particular applications. For example, the competitiveness and antagonistic activity of C. subhashii was strongly increased in the presence of N-acetylglucosamin as the sole carbon source, M. pulcherrima and A. pullulans were the strongest competitors on apple, and C. sargentensis competed the best in soil microcosms. Based on these laboratory studies, M. pulcherrima and A. pullulans are promising candidates for biocontrol applications against fungal phyllosphere diseases, while C. sargentensis may hold potential for use against soilborne fungal pathogens. These results document the potential of MALDI-TOF MS for the quantitative analysis of synthetic yeast communities and highlight the value of studying microorganisms with relevant functions in moderately complex, synthetic communities and natural substrates rather than as individual isolates.","Yeast (Chichester, England)","['D000898', 'D061046', 'D002175', 'D003470', 'D027845', 'D059013', 'D010843', 'D012441', 'D012988', 'D019032', 'D015003']","['Antibiosis', 'Biological Control Agents', 'Candida', 'Culture Media', 'Malus', 'Microbial Consortia', 'Pichia', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Yeasts']",Characterization of antagonistic yeasts for biocontrol applications on apples or in soil by quantitative analyses of synthetic yeast communities.,"[None, None, 'Q000254', 'Q000737', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000254', 'Q000254', None, None, 'Q000145']","[None, None, 'growth & development', 'chemistry', 'microbiology', None, 'growth & development', 'growth & development', None, None, 'classification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29752875,2019
29724046,"Ultra-performance convergence chromatography is an environmentally-friendly analytical method that uses dramatically reduced amounts of organic solvents. In addition, a robust and highly sensitive chiral separation method was developed for the novel chiral acaricide cyflumetofen by using ultra-performance convergence chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, which shows that stereoisomer recoveries determined for various apple parts ranged from 78.3% to 119.9%, with the relative standard deviations being lower than 14.0%. The half-lives of (−)-cyflumetofen and (+)-cyflumetofen obtained under 5-fold applied dosage equal to 22.13 and 22.23 days, respectively. For 1.5-fold applied dosage, the respective values were determined as 22.42 and 23.64 days, i.e., the degradation of (−)-cyflumetofen was insignificantly favored over that of its enantiomer. Importantly, cyflumetofen was unevenly distributed in apples, with its relative contents in apple peel, peduncle, and pomace equal to 50%, 22%, and 16%, respectively. The proposed method can be used to efficiently separate and quantify chiral pesticide with advantages of a shorter analysis time, greater sensitivity, and better environmental compatibility. Additionally, the consumption of apples with residue of cyflumetofen did not pose a health risk to the population if the cyflumetofen applied under satisfactory agricultural practices after the long-term dietary risk assessment.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D005504', 'D005638', 'D006801', 'D027845', 'D011422', 'D018570']","['Food Analysis', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Malus', 'Propionates', 'Risk Assessment']",Residue and Dietary Risk Assessment of Chiral Cyflumetofen in Apple.,"['Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","['methods', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29724046,2018

Thus, EU regulation was recently modified to include phthalimide in the folpet residue definition. However, recent studies have shown that phthalimide could also be generated from different sources, which could lead to an overestimation of the phthalimide content and therefore to false positives. GC coupled with either negative chemical ionisation and single quadrupole mass spectrometry, or electron ionisation with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-EI-MS/MS), were evaluated for the determination of folpet and phthalimide in food. Both methods were validated in 4 different matrices namely apple puree, rice flour, raspberry puree and infant formula. Better selectivity and precision were obtained with GC-EI-MS/MS.

A total of 72 volatile compounds were identified in the 14 apple ciders using dynamic headspace sampling (DHS) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The main volatile compounds found in apple ciders were esters and higher alcohols, followed by aldehydes and fatty acids. Sensory characterizations of the aroma and taste of apple ciders were carried out by a trained sensory panel using descriptive analysis with 23 sensory attributes. The attributes apple, cooked apple, yeasty, sweet and sour were the most predominant sensory descriptors used to describe the similarities and differences in the samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that floral and fruity (fresh apple, banana and pear) odors were highly associated with sweet taste and opposed to the more complex aroma attributes (yeasty, lactic, chemical, mouldy, black pepper and earthy) and sour taste. Most of the UK apple ciders were characterized by these complex odors and taste notes sour, astringent and bitter, whereas ciders from the Scandinavian region had diverse sensory profiles. Partial least squares regression (PLS) based on the sensory and chemical data was able to cluster the ciders according to differences in production methods (oak-aged or spontaneous fermentation; controlled malolactic fermentation; industrial production with flavor modifications). Moreover, this study also suggested that ciders with marked levels of acetate esters were characterized by cooked/fresh apple, citrus and tropical fruit odors.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000143', 'D000328', 'D000434', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D006863', 'D027845', 'D008875', 'D009812', 'D055696', 'D012537', 'D012903', 'D000073893', 'D013649', 'D055697', 'D006113', 'D055549']","['Acids', 'Adult', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Malus', 'Middle Aged', 'Odorants', 'Olfactory Perception', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries', 'Smell', 'Sugars', 'Taste', 'Taste Perception', 'United Kingdom', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Flavor profiling of apple ciders from the UK and Scandinavian region.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433266,2019

A modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method was applied to determine 26 pesticides (organophosphates, organochlorines, synthetic pyrethroids, and herbicides) in different complex matrices, including cauliflower, cucumber, banana, apple, wheat, and black gram. Different physicochemical characterization techniques were used to investigate the engineering and structural properties of the r-DSPE sorbent. All the chromatographic analyses were performed with a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector. The recoveries of all 26 pesticides were acceptable (70-120%), with relative standard deviations of less than 15%. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 1.13-5.48 ng/g and 3.42-16.60 ng/g, respectively.

With the intent to determine minimal fit-for-purpose sample size, analyses were conducted for up to 93 incurred and added pesticide residues in 10 common fruits and vegetables processed using different sample comminution equipment. The commodities studied consisted of apple, banana, broccoli, celery, grape, green bean, peach, potato, orange, and squash. A Blixer® was used to chop the bulk samples at room temperature, and test portions of 15, 10, 5, 2, and 1 g were taken for analysis (n = 4 each). Additionally, 40 g subsamples (after freezing) were further comminuted using a cryomill device with liquid nitrogen, and test portions of 5, 2, and 1 g were analyzed (n = 4 each). Both low-pressure gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LPGC-MS/MS) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS/MS were used for analysis. An empirical approach was followed to isolate and estimate the measurement uncertainty contribution of each step in the overall method by adding quality control spikes prior to each step. Addition of an internal standard during extraction normalized the sample preparation step to 0% error contribution, and coefficients of variation (CVs) were 6-7% for the analytical steps (LC and GC) and 6-9% for the sample processing techniques. In practice, overall CVs averaged 9-11% among the different analytes, commodities, batches, test portion weights, and analytical and sample processing methods.

The developed bespoke polymer demonstrates a quantitative binding towards the patulin present in undiluted apple juice. The polymer is inexpensive and easy to mass-produce. The contributing factors to the function of the adsorbent is a combination of acidic and basic functional monomers producing a zwitterionic complex in the solution that formed stronger binding complexes with the patulin molecule.

Matrices, including apple, cabbage, tomato, cucumber, rice, and wheat were extracted with a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe ""QuEChERS"" method and purified with a new clean-up sorbent (Z-Sep). A hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column (HILIC), exhibiting a lipophilic-hydrophilic character, was used to separate the three analytes over 10min using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Matrix effects in various matrices were evaluated and an isotope-labelled internal standard method was employed to compensate for ion enhancement/suppression effects. At three fortification levels (2.0, 5.0, and 20.0μg/kg), the mean recoveries ranged from 78.5 to 112.1% with relative standard deviations (RSDs)<11.0% for all tested analytes. The limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were 0.04-0.45 and 0.12-1.58μg/kg in various matrices, respectively.

29027463,"Gas chromatography/olfactometry (GC/O) has been used in various fields as a valuable method to identify odor-active components from a complex mixture. Since human assessors are employed as detectors to obtain the olfactory perception of separated odorants, the GC/O technique is limited by its subjectivity, variability, and high cost of the trained panelists. Here, we present a proof-of-concept model by which odor information can be obtained by machine-learning-based prediction from molecular parameters (MPs) of odorant molecules. The odor prediction models were established using a database of flavors and fragrances including 1026 odorants and corresponding verbal odor descriptors (ODs). Physicochemical parameters of the odorant molecules were acquired by use of molecular calculation software (DRAGON). Ten representative ODs were selected to build the prediction models based on their high frequency of occurrence in the database. The features of the MPs were extracted via either unsupervised (principal component analysis) or supervised (Boruta, BR) approaches and then used as input to calibrate machine-learning models. Predictions were performed by various machine-learning approaches such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and extreme learning machine. All models were optimized via parameter tuning and their prediction accuracies were compared. A SVM model combined with feature extraction by BR-C (confirmed only) was found to afford the best results with an accuracy of 97.08%. Validation of the models was verified by using the GC/O data of an apple sample for comparison between the predicted and measured results. The prediction models can be used as an auxiliary tool in the existing GC/O by suggesting possible OD candidates to the panelists and thus helping to give more objective and correct judgment. In addition, a machine-based GC/O in which the panelist is no longer needed might be expected after further development of the proposed odor prediction technique.",Analytical chemistry,"['D002627', 'D002849', 'D006801', 'D000069550', 'D009812', 'D064367']","['Chemistry, Physical', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Humans', 'Machine Learning', 'Odorants', 'Olfactometry']",Machine-Learning-Based Olfactometer: Prediction of Odor Perception from Physicochemical Features of Odorant Molecules.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29027463,2019

In the present study, we investigated the role of a nicotianamine synthase 1 gene (MxNas1) in an apple species, Malus xiaojinensis, that has a more Fe-efficient genotype than other apple species and ecotypes. To characterise the response of M. xiaojinensis to Fe deficiency, we used quantitative Q-PCR to determine the level of expression of MxNas1 and Western blot to measure protein levels. Immunohistochemical staining and GFP fluorescence localisation of the MxNAS1 protein were also carried out. HPLC and polarised absorption spectrophotometry were performed to investigate the effects of overexpression of MxNas1 in order to elucidate the role of MxNAS1 in the cellular uptake of active Fe in tobacco suspension cells. We found that MxNas1 expression and protein levels were higher under Fe deficiency stress than under Fe sufficiency. Immunohistochemical staining showed that MxNAS1 was localised mainly in the epidermal and vascular tissues of the roots, vascular tissues of the stem and palisade cells of mature leaves, and in parenchyma cells of young leaves. MxNAS1 was mainly localised in the plasma membranes and vesicles of protoplasts. In addition, overexpression of MxNas1 in stable transgenic tobacco cells increased NA and active Fe content under Fe sufficiency.

The Lactobacillus casei fermentation imparted a reduction of ethyl butanoate, ethyl-2-methylbutirate, and ethyl hexanoate for melon juice; and of ethyl acetate, ethyl-2-methyl butanoate, ethyl crotonate, ethyl isovalerate, benzaldehyde, and ethyl hexanoate for cashew juice. Measurements of the stability of these compounds and the formation of the component 3-methyl-2-butenyl in melon juice may be used as a volatile marker to follow the juice fermentation.

In this case, the UV photodegradation of aqueous patulin solutions was studied at acidic pH values (3-6) similar to the values of apple juices where patulin has been found, obtaining that the first-order kinetic constant increased when the acidity of the reaction media was also increased (pH decreased). From the parameters obtained by fitting the experimental data to both the Arrhenius and Van't Hoff equations, the existence of kinetic and thermodynamic compensations was studied. Apparent kinetic and thermodynamic compensations were concluded, the isokinetic and isoequilibrium temperatures being -13.4 and -15.4°C, respectively. As the harmonic mean temperature was 34.3°C, applying the statistical criterion, it was concluded that both compensations were real, the reaction mechanism control changing from enthalpic for temperatures lower than the isokinetic-isoequilibrium temperatures (-13.4/-15.4°C) to entropic for higher temperatures.

Our results of the physiology analysis indicated that the MBB genotype could produce more osmosis-regulating substances. Furthermore, phosphoproteins from leaves of both genotypes under moderate drought stress were analyzed using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification technology. A total of 595 unique phosphopeptides, 682 phosphorylated sites, and 446 phosphoproteins were quantitatively analyzed in the two genotypes. Five and thirty-five phosphoproteins with the phosphorylation levels significantly changed (PLSC) were identified in M26 and MBB, respectively.

Gene ontology analyses revealed that the PLSC phosphoproteins represent a unique combination of metabolism, transcription, translation, and protein processing, suggesting that the response in apple to moderate drought stress encompasses a new and unique homeostasis of major cellular processes. The basic trend was an increase in protein and organic molecules abundance related to drought. These increases were higher in MBB than in M26.

The leaf-mining moth Phyllonorycter blancardella modifies the cytokinin (CK) profile of mined leaf-tissues, and the insect symbiotic bacteria Wolbachia is involved in the plant manipulation to the benefit of the insect host. To gain a deeper understanding into the possible origin and dynamics of CKs, we conducted an extensive characterization of CKs in larvae and in infected apple leaves. Our results show the enhanced CK levels in mines, both on green and yellow leaves, allowing insects to control their nutritional supply under fluctuating environmental conditions. The spatial distribution of CKs within the mined leaves shows that hormone manipulation is strictly limited to the mine suggesting the absence of CK translocation from distant leaf areas toward the insect feeding site. Mass spectrometry analyses reveal that major CK types accumulating in mines and larvae are similar to what is observed for most gall-inducers, suggesting that strategies underlying the plant manipulation may be shared between herbivorous insects with distinct life histories. Results further show that CKs are detected in the highest levels in larvae, reinforcing our hypothesis that CKs accumulating in the mines originate from the insect itself. Presence of bacteria-specific methylthio-CKs is consistent with previous results suggesting that insect bacterial symbionts contribute to the observed phenotype.

28454713,"Apple ring rot, caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea, is a serious apple disease in China. Bacillus subtilis 9407 was isolated from healthy apples and showed strong antifungal activity against B. dothidea. To identify the primary antifungal compound of B. subtilis 9407 and determine its role in controlling apple ring rot, a transposon mutant library was constructed using TnYLB-1, and a mutant completely defective in antifungal activity was obtained. The gene inactivated in the antifungal activity mutant had 98.5% similarity to ppsB in B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168, which encodes one of the five synthetases responsible for synthesizing fengycin. A markerless ppsB deletion mutant was constructed. Compared with the wild-type strain, lipopeptide crude extracts from ΔppsB showed almost no inhibition of B. dothidea mycelial growth. Furthermore, fengycin-like lipopeptides (retention factor 0.1-0.2) that exhibited antifungal activity against B. dothidea were observed in the wild-type strain by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-bioautography analysis, but not in ΔppsB. Semipreparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) detection revealed that ΔppsB lost the ability to synthesize fengycin. These results suggest that ppsB is responsible for synthesizing fengycin and that fengycin is the major antifungal compound produced by B. subtilis 9407 against B. dothidea. Moreover, a biocontrol assay showed that the control efficacy of ΔppsB was reduced by half compared with the wild-type strain, indicating that fengycin plays a major role in controlling apple ring rot disease.

Different types and grades of filter aids were analyzed for arsenic, lead, and cadmium with inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry. Potential factors affecting the transfer of heavy metals to juices during filtration treatments were evaluated. Effects of washing treatments on removal of heavy metals from filter aids were also determined. Results showed that diatomaceous earth (DE) generally contained a higher level of arsenic than perlite, whereas perlite had a higher lead content than DE. Cellulose contained the lowest level of arsenic among the surveyed filter aids. All samples of food-grade filter aids contained arsenic and lead levels that were below the U.S. Pharmacopeia and National Formulary limits of 10 ppm of total leachable arsenic and lead for food-grade DE filter aids. Two samples of arsenic-rich (>3 ppm) food-grade filter aids raised the level of arsenic in apple and grape juices during laboratory-scale filtration treatments, whereas three samples of low-arsenic (<1 ppm) food-grade filter aids did not affect arsenic levels in filtered juices. Filtration tests with simulated juices (pH 2.9 to 4.1, Brix [°Bx] 8.2 to 18.1, total suspended solids [TSS] 0.1 to 0.5%) showed that pH or sugar content had no effect on arsenic levels of filtered juices, whereas arsenic content of filtered juice was elevated when higher amounts of filter aid were used for filtration. Authentic unfiltered apple juice (pH 3.6, °Bx 12.9, TSS 0.4%) and grape juice (pH 3.3, °Bx 16.2, TSS 0.05%) were used to verify results obtained with simulated juices.

28434710,"In the last 10 years, the majority of the pesticide food control laboratories moved from GC-MS to GC-MS/MS as the preferred analytical technique to address GC amenable compounds. The main reason for this change was the negative impact on the single stage GC-MS analysis caused by the interference from coeluting matrix compounds. The new development of gas chromatography coupled to high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (GC-HRAMS) provides opportunities to overcome such matrix interferences as a result of its much higher selectivity; allowing laboratories to carry out full-scan analysis covering the most exigent analytical performance criteria. The aim of this work is the evaluation of the main analytical performance parameters for the multiresidue screening of pesticide residues by a gas chromatography-Orbitrap™ mass spectrometer in fruits and vegetables. Electron ionization and full-scan high resolution mass spectrometry was selected for this evaluation. Mass resolving power, selectivity, sensitivity, analyte identification and database generation are discussed in light of the analysis of various commodities and a large scope of pesticides. The selected operational conditions provided optimal mass accuracy, within ±1mDa and achieved LOQs of 10μg/kg or lower for practically all the selected pesticides and commodities. Applicability for quantitative residue analysis was verified by the validation of the 210 pesticides in four matrices (tomato, apple, leek and orange).

The proposed strategy proved to be a powerful tool to solve the problems of coelution, unknown interferences, and chromatographic shifts in the process of high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, making it possible for the determination of 12 polyphenols in complex apple matrices within 10 min under simple conditions of elution. The average recoveries with standard deviations, and figures of merit including sensitivity, selectivity, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation were calculated to validate the accuracy of the proposed method. Compared to the quantitative analysis results from the classic high-performance liquid chromatography method, the statistical and graphical analysis showed that our proposed strategy obtained more reliable results.

Golden Delicious) foliage that was either intact, mechanically-damaged, or exposed to larval feeding by Pandemis heparana (Denis and Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Volatiles were collected by closed-loop-stripping-analysis and characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in three time periods: after 1 h and again 24 and 48 h later. Volatiles for all treatments also were monitored continuously over a 72-h period by the use of proton transfer reaction - time of flight-mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS). In addition, the volatile samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) using male and female antennae of P. heparana. Twelve compounds were detected from intact foliage compared with 23 from mechanically-damaged, and 30 from P. heparana-infested foliage. Interestingly, six compounds were released only by P. heparana-infested foliage. The emission dynamics of many compounds measured by PTR-ToF-MS showed striking differences according to the timing of herbivory and the circadian cycle. For example, the emission of green leaf volatiles began shortly after the start of herbivory, and increased over time independently from the light-dark cycle. Conversely, the emission of terpenes and aromatic compounds showed a several-hour delay in response to herbivory, and followed a diurnal rhythm. Methanol was the only identified volatile showing a nocturnal rhythm. Consistent GC-EAD responses were found for sixteen compounds, including five aromatic ones.

Based on the suggestion of overlapping of NO and PAs biosynthetic pathways, we demonstrated a cross-talk of NO and PAs in regulation of embryonic dormancy release. The aim of the work was to investigate an impact of PAs (Put, Spd and Spm) or NO short-term fumigation on nitrite, urea, Arg and ornithine (Orn) content, NO synthase-like (NOS-like) and arginase activity in axes of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) embryos during dormancy alleviation and at the stage of termination of germination sensu stricto. NO, Put/Spd induced dormancy breakage and germination of apple embryos corresponded to stimulation of urea cycle and high free Arg pool in seedlings roots. After two days of the culture Put and Spd stimulated Arg dependent NO formation, inhibition of which was observed after Spm application. Put or Spd application as well as NO short-term pretreatment of apple embryos influenced level of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Higher abundance of such modified proteins correlated well to the declined content of nitrated proteins, suggesting their important role in regulation of embryo germination. NO led to stimulation of embryos germination by increasing level of free PAs (mostly Put). While transcriptomic approach showed down regulation of Spm synthesis and up-regulation of Spm degradation by NO, confirming negative role of Spm over-accumulation in embryo dormancy removal.

The development of the Earth's aerobic atmosphere has increased the demand for iron (Fe) in organisms, and Fe deficiency has become a limiting environmental factor for plant growth. Here, we demonstrate that genus Malus adapt to Fe deficiency through modification of the Iron-Regulated Transporter1 (IRT1) promoter. Specifically, an IRT1 mutant allele with a TATA-box insertion in the promoter region upstream of the coding region exhibited increased IRT1 expression. The altered IRT1 promoter is responsible for enhancing Fe uptake. Increasing the number of synthetic repeat TATA-boxes correlates with increased promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the insertion of the TATA-box correlates with an increase in transcriptional activation via specific binding of the transcription factor IID (MDP0000939369). Taken together, these results indicate that an allelic insertion of a TATA-box in a gene promoter has allowed apple to adapt to the selective pressure posed by Fe deficiency.

The scope of the method includes plant growth regulators (chlormequat, daminozide, diquat, maleic hydrazide, mepiquat, paraquat), pesticides (cyromazine, the metabolite of the fungicide propineb PTU (propylenethiourea), amitrole), various multiclass antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides quinolones, kasugamycin and mycotoxins (aflatoxin B1, B2, fumonisin B1 and ochratoxin A).

A phylogenetic analysis of MdMYB93 and Arabidopsis thaliana MYBs was performed and the function of MdMYB93 was further investigated using Agrobacterium-mediated transient overexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. An RNA-Seq analysis was performed to highlight the MdMYB93-regulated genes.

27649517,"Garlic causes a strong garlic breath that may persist for almost a day. Therefore, it is important to study deodorization techniques for garlic breath. The volatiles responsible for garlic breath include diallyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, allyl methyl disulfide, and allyl methyl sulfide. After eating garlic, water (control), raw, juiced or heated apple, raw or heated lettuce, raw or juiced mint leaves, or green tea were consumed immediately. The levels of the garlic volatiles on the breath were analyzed from 1 to 60 min by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). Garlic was also blended with water (control), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), rosemarinic acid, quercetin or catechin, and the volatiles in the headspace analyzed from 3 to 40 min by SIFT-MS. Raw apple, raw lettuce, and mint leaves significantly decreased all of the garlic breath volatiles in vivo. The proposed mechanism is enzymatic deodorization where volatiles react with phenolic compounds. Apple juice and mint juice also had a deodorizing effect on most of the garlic volatiles but were generally not as effective as the raw food, probably because the juice had enzymatic activity but the phenolic compounds had already polymerized. Both heated apple and heated lettuce produced a significant reduction of diallyl disulfide and allyl mercaptan. The presence of phenolic compounds that react with the volatile compounds even in the absence of enzymes is the most likely mechanism. Green tea had no deodorizing effect on the garlic volatile compounds. Rosmarinic acid, catechin, quercetin, and PPO significantly decreased all garlic breath volatiles in vitro.

The automatic device was aimed to reduce labor-consuming manual operation workload in the cleanup steps. It could control the volume and the speed of pulling and pushing cycles accurately. In this work, m-PFC was based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) mixed with other sorbents and anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in a packed tip for analysis of pesticide multi-residues in crop commodities followed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) detection. It was validated by analyzing 25 pesticides in six representative matrices spiked at two concentration levels of 10 and 100μg/kg. Salts, sorbents, m-PFC procedure, automated pulling and pushing volume, automated pulling speed, and pushing speed for each matrix were optimized. After optimization, two general automated m-PFC methods were introduced to relatively simple (apple, citrus fruit, peanut) and relatively complex (spinach, leek, green tea) matrices. Spike recoveries were within 83 and 108% and 1-14% RSD for most analytes in the tested matrices. Matrix-matched calibrations were performed with the coefficients of determination >0.997 between concentration levels of 10 and 1000μg/kg.

However, the role of highly polymeric procyanidins (PP), which are major non-absorbable flavonoids, in the biological effects, is not completely understood. Here, we show that 0.5% PP administration for 20 weeks alleviated obesity and regulate expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet. PP-treatment attenuated weight gain and inflammatory effects including lipopolysaccharide and gut permeability. Additionally, metabolic urine profiling using high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight/mass spectrometry demonstrated that PP-treatment decreased the levels of endogenous metabolites associated with insulin resistance. Furthermore, microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the cecum demonstrated that PP administration markedly decreased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increased eight times the proportion of Akkermansia.

27443204,"Most countries have clearly defined regulations governing the use of pesticides in agricultural activity. The application of pesticides in agriculture usually leads to a residual amount of these pesticides on food products such as fruit and vegetables. The presence of pesticide residues on these foods destined for human consumption may pose food safety risks to consumers. To protect consumers, national authorities have established maximum limits for pesticide residues in foods. These limits can only be enforced if there are methods available to detect and monitor their concentrations in the applicable food products. To support the enforcement of this legislation, we have developed a multi-residue liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the analysis of 120 pesticide residues in apples and cucumbers which has been validated and implemented in the routine monitoring and surveillance programme for these pesticides. In this method, apple and cucumber samples are extracted using the QuEChERS method (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) and the extracts were analyzed directly by LC-MS/MS. The mean recoveries at three different concentrations of 0.01 µg/g , 0.05 µg/g, and 0.1 µg/g over the analytical range varied between 70 and 120%. The repeatability of the method expressed as %RSD was less than 20%. The limit of detection (LOD) of the method ranged between 0.0014 and 0.0110 µg/g for apples and between 0.0012 and 0.0075 µg/g for cucumbers. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was 0.01 µg/g for apples and cucumbers. The method has been used for the analysis of over 600 apple and 550 cucumber samples over the past two years.

The procedure involved extraction of the rodenticides from samples with acetone, followed by liquid-liquid partitioning with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and 10% sodium chloride aqueous solution, then cleanup using GPC, and finally, analysis using LC-MS/MS. High recoveries from the GPC column were obtained for all rodenticides tested using a mobile phase of acetone/cyclohexane/triethylamine (400:1600:1, v/v/v). An ODS column, which contains low levels of metal impurities, gave satisfactory peak shapes for both hydroxycoumarin- and indandione-type rodenticides in the LC-MS/MS separation. The average recoveries of rodenticides from eight agricultural foods (apple, eggplant, cabbage, orange, potato, tomato, brown rice, and soybean) fortified at 0.0005-0.001 mg/kg ranged from 76 to 116%, except for bromadiolone in orange (53%) and diphacinone in soybean (54%), and the relative standard deviations ranged from 1 to 16%. The proposed method effectively removed interfering components, such as pigments and lipids, and showed high selectivity. In addition, the matrix effects were negligible for most of the rodenticide/food combinations.

Generally, firm-juicy cultivars had a shorter time to first swallow (Tswal) and a higher number of swallows (Nswal), while softer-mealy cultivars had a longer Tswal and a lower Nswal. Firm-juicy cultivars containing high VOC concentrations had a short time to maximum intensity (Tmax) owing to a shorter Tswal and a higher Nswal as juice was released during mastication. Swallowing increased VOC flow through the nasal cavity. These results differ from previous flavour release studies with gel/gel-like model systems as juiciness/release of fluids is not a factor in such matrices.

27338331,"""Starkrimson"" is a traditional apple cultivar that was developed a long time ago and was widely cultivated in the arid region of the northern Wei River of China. However, little information regarding the quality characteristics of ""Starkrimson"" fruit has been reported in this area. To elucidate these characteristics, the color, soluble sugars, organic acids, anthocyanins and aroma components were measured during the ripening period through the use of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicated that the changes in anthocyanin contents took place later than the changes in the Commission International Eclairage (CIE) parameters. Meanwhile, cyanidin 3-galactoside (cy3-gal), fructose, sucrose, glucose and malic acid were the primary organic compounds, and 1-butanol-2-methyl-acetate, 2-hexenal and 1-hexanol were the most abundant aroma components in the skin. Furthermore, rapidly changing soluble sugars and organic acid synchronization took place in the early ripening period, while rapidly changing aroma components occurred later, on the basis of fresh weight.

27299743,"NO donors and Arg remove dormancy of apple embryos and stimulate germination. Compounds lowering NO level (cPTIO, L -NAME, CAN) strengthen dormancy. Embryo transition from dormancy state to germination is linked to increased nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like activity. Germination of embryos is associated with declined level of biotin containing proteins and nitrated proteins in soluble protein fraction of root axis. Pattern of nitrated proteins suggest that storage proteins are putative targets of nitration. Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a key regulatory factor in removal of seed dormancy and is a signal necessary for seed transition from dormant state into germination. Modulation of NO concentration in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) embryos by NO fumigation, treatment with NO donor (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine, SNAP), application of 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), N ω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), canavanine (CAN) or arginine (Arg) allowed us to investigate the NO impact on seed dormancy status. Arg analogs and NO scavenger strengthened embryo dormancy by lowering reactive nitrogen species level in embryonic axes. This effect was accompanied by strong inhibition of NOS-like activity, without significant influence on tissue NO2 (-) concentration. Germination sensu stricto of apple embryos initiated by dormancy breakage via short term NO treatment or Arg supplementation were linked to a reduced level of biotinylated proteins in root axis. Decrease of total soluble nitrated proteins was observed at the termination of germination sensu stricto. Also modulation of NO tissue status leads to modification in nitrated protein pattern. Among protein bands that correspond to molecular mass of approximately 95 kDa, storage proteins (legumin A-like and seed biotin-containing protein) were identified, and can be considered as good markers for seed dormancy status.

The method allows the rapid assessment of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and patulin content in apple and pear derivatives. The chromatographic separation of the compounds was achieved in a short chromatographic run (12.2min) suitable for routine controls of these compounds in the fruit juice industry. The optimal conditions for the injection-port derivatization were at 270°C, 0.5min purge-off, and a 1:2 sample:derivatization reagent ratio (v/v). These conditions represent an important saving in terms of derivatization reagent consumption and sample preparation time. Quality parameters were assessed for the target compounds, giving LOD of 0.7 and 1.6μg/kg and LOQ of 2 and 5μg/kg for patulin and HMF, respectively. These values are below the maximum patulin concentration in food products intended for infants and young children. Repeatability (%RSD n=5) was below 12% for both compounds. In addition, the method linearity ranged between 25 and 1000μg/kg and between 5 and 192μg/kg for HMF and patulin, respectively. Finally, the method was applied to study HMF and patulin content in various fruit juice samples. ",Journal of chromatography.

27211686,"Total fluorescence spectra (excitation-emission matrices, EEM) were recorded for a series of commercial apple juices, including clear and cloudy juices produced from concentrate, cloudy juices that were not from concentrate, and freshly squeezed juices. An exploratory study of the spectra with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) revealed three groups of fluorophores with different emission properties, and these properties were characterized by excitation/emission maxima at 270/315nm, (310, 370)/455nm, and 430/(550, 680)nm, respectively. A regression analysis of the total fluorescence spectra arranged into three-way arrays using N-way partial least squares regression methods (NPLS1 and NPLS2) and an analysis of the unfolded spectra by partial least squares methods (PLS1 and PLS2) revealed quantitative relations between the fluorescence and antioxidant properties of juices. The best models for the total phenolic contents and total antioxidant capacities were obtained by applying the NPLS1 method to the EEM. The model parameters were as follows: R(2)CV=0.802, RPD=2.3 for the total phenolic content and R(2)CV=0.808 and RPD=2.3 for the total antioxidant capacity.

Regarding this, the European Commission establishes that the qualification of organic honey and other beekeeping products as being from organic production is closely bound with the characteristics of hive treatments as well as the quality of the environment. Agricultural contamination with pesticides is a challenging problem that needs to be fully addressed, in particular in the field of organic production systems. In this study, the occurrence of different classes of contaminants selected as representative of potential contamination sources were investigated in 59 organic honeys: organochlorines, OCs; organophosphates, OPs; polychlorobiphenyls, PCBs and polybromodiphenylethers, PBDEs. A method based on Accelerated Solvent Extraction with ""in line"" clean-up and GC-MS/MS detection was developed to detect contaminants.

The majority of honey samples contained at least one of the pesticides, even if their concentrations were found to be lower than its MRL. Diazinon, Mevinphos, Coumaphos, Chlorpyrifos and Quinoxyfen were the residues frequently detected in samples coming from the apple and citrus orchard areas. Furthermore, the results of the present study show that the presence of the residue in organic honey may also be affected by the geographical area (e.g. the presence of an agricultural system) confirming honey bee and beehive matrices as appropriate sentinels for monitoring contamination in the environment.

Since pyrethroid degradates can be identical to the urinary markers used in human biomonitoring, it is important to understand the contribution of these degradates when studying sources of human pyrethroid exposure. We modified the widely used Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe (QuEChERS) method to measure several current-use pyrethroids (cis/trans-permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and cyhalothrin) and their environmental degradation products (3-PBA, cis/trans-DCCA, 4-F-3-PBA, DBCA, and MPA) in selected fresh fruits and vegetables. Using fortified samples, we determined extraction efficiencies from: tomatoes, oranges (whole, peeled, and rind), grapes, apples, bananas (peeled and rind only), onions, lettuce, green peppers, carrots and broccoli. For a subset of these food items (apples, grapes, tomatoes, lettuce and banana peel), we also established limits of detection (MDLs) and quantitation (MQLs). Each sample was homogenized (1kg) then spiked with the target pyrethroids and their degradation products. Sub-samples (15g) were extracted with acetonitrile, then salted out and partitioned with NaCl and MgSO4. The extract was divided and further cleaned using solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges containing either graphitized non-porous carbon (pyrethroids) or C18 (degradation products). Sample analysis was via liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Considering the mean recoveries each of the 14 analytes in all 13 matrices: 42% of the recoveries were ≥90%, 70% were ≥80%, and 90% were ≥70%. All MDL's were less than 100ng/kg, except 3-PBA (132ng/kg, tomato), MPA (129ng/kg, tomato), and trans-permethrin (141ng/kg, banana peel). We then applied the method to non-spiked samples (subset of 5 for which the MDLs/MQLs had been determined) collected weekly for four weeks from local supermarkets. At least one pyrethroid was present in measureable concentrations in all matrices except banana peels. In contrast, the only degradation products detected were cis/trans-DCCA, in one lettuce sample.

Here, an infection model is introduced to study proteomic changes in a highly virulent E. amylovora strain upon interaction with its host as compared to a lower virulent strain. For this purpose separate shoots of apple rootstocks were wound-infected and when infection became systemic, bacterial cells were isolated and processed for analysis in a proteomics platform combining 2-D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Comparing the proteome of the isolates, significant abundance changes were observed in proteins involved in sorbitol metabolism, amylovoran production as well as in protection against plant defense mechanisms. Furthermore several proteins associated with virulence were more abundant in the higher virulent strain. Changes at the proteome level showed good accordance at the transcript level, as was verified by RT-qPCR.

The acetic acid bacterial consortium was composed of Acetobacter and Komagataeibacter with the Komagataeibacter genus outcompeting the Acetobacter in all apple cider vinegar samples at the end of oxidation cycle. Among the lactic acid bacterial consortium two dominating genera were identified, Lactobacillus and Oenococcus, with Oenococcus prevailing with increasing concentration of acetic acid in vinegars. Unexpectedly, a minor genus of the acetic acid bacterial consortium in organic apple cider vinegar was Gluconobacter, suggesting a possible development of the Gluconobacter population with a tolerance against ethanol and acetic acid.

The objective of this study was to develop a pretreatment method with countercurrent chromatography (CCC) for enrichment and cleanup of trace Alternaria mycotoxins in food samples prior to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. An Analytical CCC instrument with a column volume 22.5mL was used, and a two-phase solvent system composed of ethyl acetate and water modified with 6% [HOOMIM][Cl] in mass to volume ratio was selected. Under the optimized CCC operation conditions, trace amounts of AOH, AME, and TeA in large volume of liquid sample were efficiently extracted and enriched in the stationary phase, and then eluted out just by reversing the stationary phase as mobile phase in the opposite flowing direction tail-to-head. The enrichment and elution strategies are unique and can be fulfilled online with high enrichment factors (87-114) and high recoveries (81.14-110.94%). The method has been successively applied to the determination of Alternaria mycotoxins in real apple juice and wine samples with the limits of detection (LOD) in the range of 0.03-0.14μgL(-1). Totally 12 wine samples and 15 apple juice samples from the local market were analyzed. The detection rate of AOH and AME in both kinds of the samples were more than 50%, while TeA was found in relatively high level of 1.75-49.61μgL(-1) in some of the apple juice samples.

These processes are affected by proanthocyanidins bound to cell wall polysaccharides, which are present in high concentrations during the processing of the fruits. Therefore, the effective extraction of proanthocyanidins from fruits to their juices or derived products will depend on the ability to manage these associations, and, in this respect, enzymes that degrade these polysaccharides could play an important role. The main objective of this work was to test the role of pure hydrolytic enzymes (polygalacturonase and cellulose) and a commercial enzyme containing these two activities on the extent of proanthocyanidin-cell wall interactions. The results showed that the modification promoted by enzymes reduced the amount of proanthocyanidins adsorbed to cell walls since they contributed to the degradation and release of the cell wall polysaccharides, which diffused into the model solution.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether occupational allergy to peach tree pollen as a member of Rosaceae family is IgE-mediated and to evaluate the cross-reactivity among Rosaceae family pollens. Allergen skin test and conjunctival challenge test were performed; enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA), inhibiting ELISA, western immunoblotting and inhibiting western immunoblotting were done with Rosaceae family orchard pollens, including peach, apricot, cherry, apple and pear tree pollens. Mass spectrometry was also performed to probe the main allergen component and cross-reactive protein. Sensitizations to peach pollen were found in both skin test and conjunctival challenge in the patients. Serum specific IgE to three pollens (peach, apricot and cherry) were detected through ELISA. When peach pollen used as solid phase, ELISA inhibition revealed other four kinds of pollens capable of inducing partial to strong inhibitions (45% to 87%), with the strongest inhibition belonging to apricot pollen (87%). Western blotting showed predominant IgE binding to a 20 KD protein among these pollens, which appeared to be a cross-reactive allergen component through western blotting inhibition.

26726936,"A simple and rapid extraction procedure for the simultaneous determination of eight mycotoxins (Alternaria toxins, ochratoxin A, patulin, citrinin) in a variety of fruit matrices has been developed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The procedure involves a one-step cleanup using homemade solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. By comparative evaluation among six various adsorbents (C18, PSA, HLB, MCX, Silica, NH2), the combination of MCX and NH2 was found to provide the most effective cleanup, removing the greatest number of matrix interferences and also allowing the quantification of all analyzed mycotoxins in fruits. The optimized extraction conditions including acidified aqueous acetonitrile and an additional salt-out step using NaCl were employed before SPE cleanup. Method validation was performed by analyzing samples spiked at three levels (LOQ, 2 LOQ and 10 LOQ). Four fruits including apple, sweet cherry, tomato and orange fruits were selected, and accuracy (recovery%), precision (RSD%), limits of quantification (LOQ), linearity and matrix effect were evaluated during validation. Matrix-matched linearity with correlation coefficients ≥ 0.9921 was established in the range of 5-200 ng mL(-1) for patulin and 1-200 ng mL(-1) for other mycotoxins, respectively. Recoveries between 74.2% and 102.4% and relative standard deviations lower than 4.7% were obtained for all tested fruits.

Must from five different commercial as well as from six genuine apple varieties were used for fermentation under similar conditions CA formation was monitored during the fermentation process. Additionally, nine commercial apple wines from commercial producers were analyzed. Analysis was performed by headspaces-GC-MS. All apple wines contained markedly high contents of the CA 3-methylbutan-1-ol (88-251 mg/L).

In the present research, a rapid and nondestructive method was proposed and testified based on self-developed Raman system for the identification and determination of deltamethrin and acetamiprid remaining in apple. The peaks of Raman spectra at 574 and 843 cm(-1) can be used to identify deltamethrin and acetamiprid, respectively, the characteristic peaks of deltamethrin and acetamiprid were still visible when the concentrations of the two pesticides were 0.78 and 0.15 mg · kg(-1) in apples samples, respectively. Calibration models of pesticide content were developed by partial least square (PLS) algorithm with different spectra pretreatment methods (Savitzky-Golay smoothing, first derivative transformation, second derivative transformation, baseline calibration, standard normal variable transformation). The baseline calibration methods by 8th order polynomial fitting gave the best results. For deltamethrin, the obtained prediction coefficient (Rp) value from PLS model for the results of prediction and gas chromatography measurement was 0.94; and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.55 mg · kg(-1). The values of Rp and RMSEP were respective 0.85 and 0.12 mg · kg(-1) for acetamiprid. According to the detect performance, applying Raman technology in the nondestructive determination of pesticide residuals in apples is feasible. In consideration of that it needs no pretreatment before spectra collection and causes no damage to sample, this technology can be used in detection department, fruit and vegetable processing enterprises, supermarket, and vegetable market.

Metabolites were extracted from apple tissues and introduced by thermal desorption into a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry instrument. The feasibility of this sampling approach, based on exploitation of microextraction principles, including negligible depletion of free analyte concentrations, solventless sampling and sample preparation, and on-site compatibility, was determined in global metabolite analysis. Rather than adopting an approach of traditional sample preparation, requiring metabolism quenching and laborious sample preparation, the objective of the study was to capture the metabolome in vivo, evaluate the feasibility of the approach to provide unbiased extraction coverage, and compare analytical precision when different SPME sampling modes are employed. The potential of in vivo DI-SPME in quantitative plant metabolomics was assessed by evaluating changes in metabolic fingerprints in response to fruit maturation.

Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa), ""guaraná"" (Paullinia cupana Kunth) powder, ready to drink boiled coffee (Coffea arabica L.), and milk chocolate (made from seeds of Theobroma cacao) had the highest TAC values, followed by collard greens (Brassica oleracea L.), beets (Beta vulgaris L.), apples (Malus domestica Borkh.), bananas (Musa paradisiaca), common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), oranges (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck), onions (Allium cepa L.), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). Other foods also showed antioxidant capacity. The binomial antioxidant capacity of foods and health was extensively discussed according to science literature. Based on the high TAC content of Brazil nuts, guaraná, coffee, chocolate, collard greens, apples, beets, beans, oranges, onions and other foods, their regular dietary intake is strongly recommended to reduce the risk of chronic non-communicable diseases.

26483187,"Engineered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are implemented in food contact materials due to their powerful antimicrobial properties and so may enter the human food chain. Hence, it is desirable to develop easy, sensitive and fast analytical screening methods for the determination of AgNPs in complex biological matrices. This study describes such a method using solid sampling high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). A recently reported novel evaluation strategy uses the atomization delay of the respective GFAAS signal as significant indicator for AgNPs and thereby allows discrimination of AgNPs from ionic silver (Ag(+)) in the samples without elaborate sample pre-treatment. This approach was further developed and applied to a variety of biological samples. Its suitability was approved by investigation of eight different food samples (parsley, apple, pepper, cheese, onion, pasta, maize meal and wheat flour) spiked with ionic silver or AgNPs. Furthermore, the migration of AgNPs from silver-impregnated polypropylene food storage boxes to fresh pepper was observed and a mussel sample obtained from a laboratory exposure study with silver was investigated. The differences in the atomization delays (Δt(ad)) between silver ions and 20-nm AgNPs vary in a range from -2.01 ± 1.38 s for maize meal to +2.06 ± 1.08 s for mussel tissue. However, the differences were significant in all investigated matrices and so indicative of the presence/absence of AgNPs. Moreover, investigation of model matrices (cellulose, gelatine and water) gives the first indication of matrix-dependent trends.

26479897,"The applicability of liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) for the quantitative analysis of pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits was demonstrated. The LC-QTOF-MS parameters, such as cone voltage, capillary voltage, collision energy and mass extraction window, were carefully optimised for the analysis of pesticide residues. The LC-QTOF-MS method was validated for 149 pesticides in four vegetables and fruits, i.e. apple, potato, cabbage and spinach, at a spiking level of 0.01 mg kg(-1). The samples were prepared according to the Japanese official multi-residue method with a modification to the column clean-up procedure. Of the 149 pesticides, recoveries in the range of 70-120% were achieved for 147 pesticides in apple, 145 in potato, 141 in cabbage and 131 in spinach, with intra-day precisions (RSDs) of < 25% and inter-day precisions (RSDs) of < 30%, which are within the acceptable range given in the Japanese method validation guideline. Matrix effects were negligible for the majority of the target pesticides. Except for spiroxamine in spinach, no interfering peaks were observed in the blank samples. The target pesticides, except those with low sensitivity, achieved calibration curves with satisfactory linearity, with correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.995 in the concentration range of 0.002-0.1 μg ml(-1). Furthermore, the majority of the target pesticides provided more than one fragment ion or isotope ion that could be used for confirmation.

An Eichrom Sr resin was used for matrix separation and an improved Zr empirical external normalization coupled with standard-sample bracketing method (Zr EEN-SSB) was applied to mass bias correction during Sr isotope MC-ICP-MS measurements. Potential influences of matrix elements, and polyatomic and isobaric interferences on the Sr isotopic determination were further evaluated using NIST SRM 987 Sr isotopic standard spiked with various amount of Ca, Mg, and Rb contents. Concentrations of Ca and Mg lower than 30 ng g(-1) or Rb < 2 ng g(-1) in 150 ng g(-1) Sr analyte were estimated to have only a minor effect on Sr isotope ratios determination. On the other hand, intensity differences between sample and standards (IntSample/IntStandards) represented a large δ (88/86)Sr deviation of <0.9 or >1.3, reflecting the significance of intensity bias attributed to different mass bias behavior. An apple leaf material, NIST SRM 1515, was adopted as the plant material for overall evaluation of sample digestion, matrix separation, and potential spectral interferences on the measurements of Sr isotope ratios. Our results suggest that the partially remaining organic compounds in the incomplete digestion would have a significant bias on the extraction chromatography procedure, resulting in sizable uncertainty in δ (88/86)Sr ratios. Thus, complete digestion of the organic-enriched materials is of great importance for efficiency assurance in matrix separation. Extraction chromatography works well for the total digested samples, where Ca, Mg, and Rb were efficiently removed.

The high affinity of TSIL toward the target compound as well as the magnetic behavior of Fe3O4 was combined to provide an efficient and simple magnetic sorbent for solid-phase extraction (SPE). The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The important parameters influencing the extraction efficiency such as pH, sorbent dosage, extraction and desorption conditions were studied and optimized.

Among 46 different components identified, chavibetol (22.0%), estragole (15.8%), β-cubebene (13.6%), chavicol (11.8%), and caryophyllene (11.3%) were found to be the major compounds of BLEO. A disc diffusion and disc volatilization method were used to evaluate antifungal activity of the oil against a selected food spoilage mould. The logistic model was used to study the kinetics of spore germination. Prediction and validation of antifungal effect of BLEO was performed on semi-synthetic medium (apple juice agar) using predictive microbiological tools. The Baranyi and Roberts model was used to estimate maximum growth rate (μmax in mm/day) and apparent lag time (λ in days) of the mould. Secondary modelling was performed using a re-parameterized Monod-type equation based on cardinal values to study the effect of different BLEO concentration on estimated growth parameters. Emax (minimum concentration of oil at which mould growth was inhibited) and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration of BLEO at which lag time is infinite) value of BLEO against P. expansum was estimated to be 0.56 and 0.74 μl/ml, respectively, which was found to be similar on potato dextrose agar (PDA) as well as apple juice agar (AJA) medium.

Different effective parameters were studied, and at the optimized conditions, limits of detection, linear dynamic ranges, and enrichment factors were ranged from 0.9 to 2.2 μg L(-1), 3.0 to 1023 μg L(-1), and 20 ± 2 to 22 ± 2, respectively. After optimization, the method was successfully applied to determine Pb(2+), Cu(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), and Cr(3+) in different biological (hair and nail), vegetable (coriander, parsley, and tarragon), fruit juice (apple, orange, and peach), and water (tap, mineral, and wastewater) samples.

26304345,Calixarene was used as a functional monomer to fabricate a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) by sol-gel technique for solid-phase microextraction (SPME) of parathion-methyl and its structural analogs. The MIP-coated fiber possessed excellent thermal and chemical stability as well as high extraction capacity. Its selectivity and possible recognition mechanism were investigated. The similarities in molecular shape and functional group play a key role in the selective recognition of the imprinted material. Any changes to the structure of the template would decrease the imprinting factor. A comparison of MIP-SPME was made with liquid-liquid extraction coupled with gas chromatography for the determination of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) in fruits. Much lower limits of detection and better recoveries were achieved by SPME in spiked apple and pineapple samples. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed method using the calixarene MIP fiber was more suitable for selective determination of trace OPPs in those fruit samples. ,Food chemistry,"['D031230', 'D047250', 'D002849', 'D004043', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D059625', 'D027845', 'D054802', 'D010575', 'D011108', 'D052617']","['Ananas', 'Calixarenes', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Liquid-Liquid Extraction', 'Malus', 'Molecular Imprinting', 'Pesticides', 'Polymers', 'Solid Phase Microextraction']",Molecularly imprinted calixarene fiber for solid-phase microextraction of four organophosphorous pesticides in fruits.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26304345,2016
26298695,"During the seasonal shift from June to August, air temperatures increase. To explore how apple trees improve their thermotolerance during this shift, we examined the photochemical reaction capacity of apple tree leaves by simultaneous measurement of prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, delayed chlorophyll fluorescence, and modulated 820 nm reflection at varying temperatures. It was found that the reaction centers and antennae of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI), the donor side of PSII, the electron transfer capacity from QA to QB, and the reoxidation capacity of plastoquinol were all sensitive to heat stress, particularly in June. As the season shifted, apple tree leaves improved in thermotolerance. Interestingly, the acclimation to seasonal shift enhanced the thermotolerance of PSII and PSI reaction centers more than that of their antennae, and the activity of PSII more than that of PSI. This may be a strategy for plant adaptation to changes in environmental temperatures. In addition, results from prompt and delayed fluorescence, as well as modulated 820 nm reflection corroborate each other. We suggest that the simultaneous measurement of the three independent signals may provide more information on thermal acclimation mechanisms of photochemical reactions in plant leaves.","Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

The performance parameters of the two instruments, such as overall recoveries, precisions, limits of detection, linear ranges, identification points and matrix effects, were evaluated according to a designed experiment. At three spiked levels (5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 µg/kg), the average recoveries for the majority of pesticides (93.0%) ranged from 70% to 120% in the four matrices with relative standard deviations below 20%. The limits of detection for most of the pesticides by GC-MS/MS and GC-Q-TOF/MS were less than 5.0 µg/kg. Compared with GC-QTOF/MS, GC-MS/MS showed relatively lower limits of detection and wider linear ranges, and its performance was more satisfactory in accurate quantitative analysis due to its superior sensitivity.

Simultaneously, a qualitative investigation on the capability of NIRS to discriminate varieties, harvest dates, storage periods and fruit inhomogeneity was carried out. In order to generate a sample set with high variability within the most relevant apple quality traits, three different harvest time points in combination with five different storage periods were chosen, and the evolution of important quality parameters was followed both with NIRS and wet chemical methods. By applying a principal component analysis (PCA) a differentiation between the two cultivars, freshly harvested vs. long-term stored apples and, notably, between the sun-exposed vs. shaded side of apples could be found. For the determination of quality parameters effective prediction models for titratable acid (TA) and individual sugars such as fructose, glucose and sucrose by using partial least square (PLS) regression have been developed.

Cyanidin-3-O-hexoside isomers were present in both 'Bekran' and 'Bastam' apples, whereas 'Bekran' apple was a valuable source of anthocyanin rutinose derivatives. Employing DPPH(•), ABTS(•+), and ORAC methods, the antiradical efficacy was evaluated. The ability of the investigated fruit components to scavenge OH(•), and O(2) (•-) reactive species was also assessed.

The adsorbent (Fe3O4@SiO2@GO-PEA) was then used in a magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of six organophosphorous pesticides (OPPs) including methyl parathion, fenitrothion, methidathion, ethion, methyl azinphos and coumaphos prior to gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus detection (GC-NPD). The fabricated adsorbent combines the advantages of superior adsorption capability of modified GO and magnetic separability of magnetite microparticles to provide high adsorption capacity, and easy isolation from sample solutions. The main experimental parameters affecting the extraction recovery of OPPs including extraction time, pH, adsorbent dosage, salt concentration, and desorption conditions were investigated and optimized.

26086845,"Understanding the defence mechanisms used by apple leaves against Alternaria alternate pathogen infection is important for breeding purposes. To investigate the ultrastructural differences between leaf tissues of susceptible and resistant seedlings, in vitro inoculation assays and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis were conducted with two different inoculation assays. The results indicated that the resistant leaves may have certain antifungal activity against A. alternate that is lacking in susceptible leaves. To elucidate the two different host responses to A. alternate infection in apples, the proteomes of susceptible and resistant apple leaves that had or had not been infected with pathogen were characterised using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS). MS identified 43 differentially expressed proteins in two different inoculation assays. The known proteins were categorised into 5 classes, among these proteins, some pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, such as beta-1,3-glucanase, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and mal d1, were identified in susceptible and resistant hosts and were associated with disease resistance of the apple host. In addition, the different levels of mal d1 in susceptible and resistant hosts may contribute to the outstanding anti-disease properties of resistant leaves against A. alternate. Taken together, the resistance mechanisms of the apple host against A. alternate may be a result of the PR proteins and other defence-related proteins. Given the complexity of the biology involved in the interaction between apple leaves and the A. alternate pathogen, further investigation will yield more valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of suppression of the A. alternate pathogen. Overall, we outline several novel insights into the response of apple leaves to pathogen attacks.

All three enzymes from A. adeninivorans were active from pH 4.5 to 6.5 and from 20 to 30°C.

Sensory analysis was also performed to compare the intensity of the cashew-like aroma of the fibers with the original juice. Altogether, 80 compounds were detected, being esters and terpenes the major chemical classes. Among the identified substances, 14 were classified as odoriferous in the literature, constituting the matrix used in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Odoriferous esters were substantially reduced, but many compounds were extracted by the strength used in the expeller press and remained until the last wash. Among them are the odoriferous compounds ethyl octanoate, γ-dodecalactone, (E)-2-decenal, copaene, and caryophyllene that may contribute for the mild but still perceptible cashew apple aroma in the fibers that have been pressed and washed five times. Development of a deodorization process should include reduction of pressing force and stop at the second wash, to save water and energy, thus reducing operational costs and contributing to process sustainability.

Apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) cultivars differ in their aroma and composition of VOCs. To determine varietal differences in the aroma profiles, VOCs emitted by 7 modern and 35 old apple cultivars were analyzed using Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS). PTR-MS is a rapid, reproducible, and non-destructive spectrometric technique for VOC analysis of single fruits, developed for direct injection analysis. In the present study, we analyzed the differences in the emission of VOCs from single fruits at harvest and after a storage period of 60±10 days, followed by 3 d of shelf life. Our results show that VOC profile differences among apple cultivars were more pronounced after storage than at harvest. Furthermore, chemodiversity was higher in old cultivars compared to modern cultivars, probably due to their greater genetic variability. Our data highlight the importance of storage and shelf life are crucial for the development of the typical aroma and flavor of several apple cultivars.

25998812,"Due to the occurrence and spread of the fungal contaminants in food and the difficulties to remove their resulting mycotoxins, rapid and accurate methods are needed for early detection of these mycotoxigenic fungi. The polymerase chain reaction and the real time PCR have been widely used for this purpose. Apples are suitable substrates for fungal colonization mostly caused by Penicillium expansum, which produces the mycotoxin patulin during fruit infection. This study describes the development of a real-time PCR assay incorporating an internal amplification control (IAC) to specifically detect and quantify P. expansum. A specific primer pair was designed from the patF gene, involved in patulin biosynthesis. The selected primer set showed a high specificity for P. expansum and was successfully employed in a standardized real-time PCR for the direct quantification of this fungus in apples. Using the developed system, twenty eight apples were analyzed for their DNA content. Apples were also analyzed for patulin content by HPLC. Interestingly, a positive correlation (R(2) = 0.701) was found between P. expansum DNA content and patulin concentration. This work offers an alternative to conventional methods of patulin quantification and mycological detection of P. expansum and could be very useful for the screening of patulin in fruits through the application of industrial quality control.

The oxidized juices, characterized using the CIE L a b parameters, displayed various colors depending on the apple variety and native phenolic composition. HPLC-DAD-MS revealed contrasting pigment profiles related to oxidized tanning and nontanning molecules. The latter were divided into two groups according to their polarity and their visible spectra. With regard to phenolic classes, flavanol monomers and hydroxycinnamic acids played an essential role in the formation of oxidation products. Interestingly, dihydrochalcones appeared to include precursors of some yellow compounds. Indeed, the yellow pigment phloretin xyloglucoside oxidation product (PXGOPj), derived from phloretin xyloglucoside, was clearly identified in apple juices as a xyloglucose analogue of the yellow pigment phloridzin oxidation product (POPj), previously characterized in a model solution by Le Guernevé et al.

They can grow on a large variety of food, including fruits, grains, and cheese. The amount of PAT in apple derivative products is a crucial issue because it is the measure of the quality of both the used raw products and the performed production process. Actually, all current methodologies used for the quantification of PAT are time-consuming and require skilled personnel beyond the sample pretreatment methods (e.g., high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and electrophoresis techniques). In this work, we present a novel fluorescence polarization approach based on the use of emergent near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probes. The use of these fluorophores coupled to anti-PAT antibodies makes possible the detection of PAT directly in apple juice without any sample pretreatment. This methodology is based on the increase of fluorescence polarization emission of a fluorescence-labeled PAT derivative on binding to specific antibodies. A competition between PAT and the fluorescence-labeled PAT derivative allowed detecting PAT.

Acetate-buffered QuEChERS was found to be the most suitable technique for most of the fruit matrices. According to the recovery values at two different concentration levels, peaches should preferably be treated by the citrate-buffered type, whereas grapes, bananas, apples, pears, and strawberries are best treated by the acetate-buffered version, although the differences in efficiency were small. The addition of graphitized carbon black significantly decreases the recovery of specific pesticides in all matrices except for strawberries. The majority of values do not exceed the official maximum residue levels set by the European Commission. Organophosphates proved to be the most commonly detected category along with triazines-triazoles-conazoles group and by carbamates. Apples and pears seem to be the most contaminated fruit matrices among those tested.

In rowan cell cultures treated with elicitor from the scab fungus, transient increases in the SaB4H, SaBIS, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase transcript levels preceded phytoalexin accumulation. Transient expression of a carboxyl-terminal reporter gene construct directed SaB4H to the endoplasmic reticulum. A construct lacking the amino-terminal leader and transmembrane domain caused cytoplasmic localization. Functional B4H coding sequences were also isolated from two apple (Malus × domestica) cultivars. The MdB4Hs were named CYP736A163.

25832782,"Patulin is a mycotoxin commonly found in certain fruit and fruit products. For this reason many countries have established regulatory limits pertaining to, in particular, apple juice and apple products. Fruit leathers are produced by dehydrating fruit puree, leaving a sweet product that has a leathery texture. A recent report in the literature described the detection of patulin at substantial levels in fruit leathers. To investigate this further, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (UPLC-PDA) method was developed for the sensitive detection of patulin in fruit leathers. Investigations were also made of the suitability of direct analysis in real time-mass spectrometry (DART-MS) for detection of patulin from the surface of fruit leathers. Results indicated DART-MS was insufficiently sensitive for quantification from the surface of home-style apple leathers, although patulin spiked onto the surface of leather or peel could be detected. The UPLC-PDA method was used to determine the fate of patulin during the preparation of home-made fruit leathers. Interestingly, when a home-style process was used, the patulin was not destroyed, but rather increased in concentration as the puree was dehydrated. The UPLC-PDA method was also used to screen for patulin in commercial fruit leathers. Of the 36 products tested, 14 were above the limit of detection (3.5 μg kg(-1)) and nine were above the limit of quantification (12 μg kg(-1)). Positive samples were confirmed by UPLC-MS/MS. Only one sample was found above the US regulatory limit for single-strength apple juice products (50 μg kg(-1)). These results suggest patulin can be concentrated during preparation and can be found in fruit leathers.

The xylo-gluco-oligosaccharides (XylGos) released were separated on CarboPac PA 200 column in less than 15 min, and, after purification, they were structurally characterized by negative electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF), a hybrid linear ion trap (LTQ)/Orbitrap and a hybrid quadrupole Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers. In order to corroborate the fragmentation routes observed on XylGos, some commercial galacto-manno-oligosaccharides (GalMOs) and glucurono-xylo-oligosaccharides were also studied. The fragmentation pathways of the ionized GalMos were similar to those of XylGos ones. The product ion spectra were mainly characterized by prominent double cleavage (D) ions corresponding to the entire inner side chains. The directed fragmentation from the reducing end to the other end was observed for the main glycosylated backbone but also for the side-chains, allowing their complete sequencing. Relevant cross-ring cleavage ions from (0,2)X(j)-type revealed to be diagnostic of the 1-2-linked- glycosyl units from XylGos together with the 1-2-linked glucuronic acid unit from glucuronoxylans. Resonant activation in the LTQ Orbitrap allowed not only determining the type of all linkages but also the O-acetyl group location on fucosylated side-chains. Moreover, the fragmentation of the different side chains using the MS(n) capabilities of the LTQ/Orbitrap analyzer also allowed differentiating terminal arabinosyl and xylosyl substituents inside S and U side-chains of XylGos, respectively. The CID spectra obtained were very informative for distinction of isomeric structures differing only in their substitution pattern.

25587929,"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the common pathogenic bacteria responsible for bacterial infectious diseases and food poisoning. This study presents an analytical method based on the affinity nanoprobe-based mass spectrometry that enables detection of S. aureus in aqueous samples. A peptide aptamer DVFLGDVFLGDEC (DD) that can recognize S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was used as the reducing agent and protective group to generate DD-immobilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs@DD) from one-pot reactions. The thiol group from cysteine in the peptide aptamer, i.e., DD, can interact with gold ions to generate DD-immobilized AuNPs in an alkaline solution. The generated AuNPs@DD has an absorption maximum at ∼518 nm. The average particle size is 7.6 ± 1.2 nm. Furthermore, the generated AuNPs@DD can selectively bind with S. aureus and MRSA. The conjugates of the target bacteria with AuNPs were directly analyzed by surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SALDI-MS). The gold ions generated from the AuNPs@DD anchored on the target bacteria were monitored. Gold ions (m/z 197 and 394) were only generated from the conjugates of the target bacterium-AuNP@DD in the SALDI process. Thus, the gold ions could be used as the indicators for the presence of the target bacteria. The detection limit of S. aureus using this method is in the order of a few tens of cells.

25560914,"Alternaria core rot is a major postharvest disease of apple fruit in several countries of the world, including Greece. The study was conducted aiming to identify the disease causal agents at species level, investigate the aggressiveness of Alternaria spp. isolates and the susceptibility of different apple varieties and determine the mycotoxigenic potential of Alternaria spp. isolates from apple fruit. Seventy-five Alternaria spp. isolates obtained from apple fruit showing core rot symptoms were identified as either Alternaria tenuissima or Alternaria arborescens at frequencies of 89.3 and 11.7%, respectively, based on the sequence of endopolygalacturonase (EndoPG) gene. Artificial inoculations of fruit of 4 different varieties (Fuji, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith and Red Delicious) and incubation at two different temperatures (2 and 25°C) showed that fruit of Fuji variety were the most susceptible and fruit of Golden Delicious the most resistant to both pathogens. In addition, the production of 3 mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) and tentoxin (TEN) was investigated in 30 isolates of both species. Mycotoxin determination was conducted both in vitro, on artificial nutrient medium and in vivo on artificially inoculated apple fruit, using a high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The results showed that most of the isolates of both species were able to produce all the 3 metabolites both in vivo and in vitro. On apple fruit A. tenuissima isolates produced more AOH than A. arborescens isolates, whereas the latter produced more TEN than the former. Such results indicate that Alternaria core rot represents a major threat of apple fruit production not only due to quantitative yield losses but also for qualitative deterioration of apple by-products.

Wild fruits were significantly more acidic than cultivated fruits, whilst the average concentration of total sugars and sweetness index were quite similar between cultivated and wild fruits. Thus, our study suggests that fruit acidity rather than sweetness is likely to have undergone selection during apple domestication.

The mass spectra were acquired from each coordinate with a lateral spatial resolution of approximately 100 μm. Specific monomers were released at their original location in the tissue, suggesting that post-hydrolysis diffusion can be neglected. Relative quantification of the species was achieved by introducing an internal standard, and the collection of data was subjected to non-supervised and supervised statistical treatments. The molecular images obtained showed a specific distribution of ions that could unambiguously be ascribed to cutinized and suberized regions observed at the surface of fruit cuticles, thus demonstrating that the method is able to probe some structural changes that affect hydrophobic cuticle polymers. Subsequent chemical assignment of the differentiating ions was performed, and all of these ions could be matched to cutin and suberin molecular markers.

They control the quality of ciders as they predominantly account for astringency, bitterness, color and aroma. In this study, we identified QTLs controlling phenolic compound concentrations and the average polymerization degree of flavanols in a cider apple progeny. Thirty-two compounds belonging to five groups of phenolic compounds were identified and quantified by reversed phase liquid chromatography on both fruit extract and juice, over three years. The average polymerization degree of flavanols was estimated in fruit by phloroglucinolysis coupled to HPLC. Parental maps were built using SSR and SNP markers and used for the QTL analysis. Sixty-nine and 72 QTLs were detected on 14 and 11 linkage groups of the female and male maps, respectively. A majority of the QTLs identified in this study are specific to this population, while others are consistent with previous studies. This study presents for the first time in apple, QTLs for the mean polymerization degree of procyanidins, for which the mechanisms involved remains unknown to this day. Identification of candidate genes underlying major QTLs was then performed in silico and permitted the identification of 18 enzymes of the polyphenol pathway and six transcription factors involved in the apple anthocyanin regulation. New markers were designed from sequences of the most interesting candidate genes in order to confirm their co-localization with underlying QTLs by genetic mapping.

25260190,"Recent studies have shown that there are detectable levels of arsenic (As) in rice, rice food products, and apple juice. This has created significant concern to the public, the food industry, and various regulatory bodies. Classic test methods typically measure total As and are unable to differentiate the various As species. Since different As species have greatly different toxicities, an analytical method was needed to separate and quantify the different inorganic and organic species of As. The inorganic species arsenite [As(+3)] and arsenate [As(+5)] are highly toxic. With this in mind, an ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma (IC-ICP/MS) method was developed and validated for rice and rice food products that can separate and individually measure multiple inorganic and organic species of As. This allows for the evaluation of the safety or risk associated with any product analyzed. The IC-ICP/MS method was validated on rice and rice food products, and it has been used successfully on apple juice.

This study demonstrates the results from nine years of investigation (2005-2013) of 696 samples of Polish apples for 182 pesticides using gas and liquid chromatography and spectrophotometric techniques. Only 33.5% of the samples did not contain residues above the limit of detection. In 66.5% of the samples, 34 pesticides were detected, of which maximum residue level (MRL) was exceeded in 3%. Multiple residues were present in 35% of the samples with two to six pesticides, and one sample contained seven compounds. A study of the health risk for children, adults and the general population consuming apples with these pesticides was performed. The pesticide residue data have been combined with the consumption of apples in the 97.5 percentile and the mean diet. A deterministic model was used to assess the chronic and acute exposures that are based on the average and high concentrations of residues. Additionally, the ""worst-case scenario"" and ""optimistic case scenario"" were used to assess the chronic risk. In certain cases, the total dietary pesticide intake calculated from the residue levels observed in apples exceeds the toxicological criteria. Children were the group most exposed to the pesticides, and the greatest short-term hazard stemmed from flusilazole at 624%, dimethoate at 312%, tebuconazole at 173%, and chlorpyrifos methyl and captan with 104% Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) each. In the cumulative chronic exposure, among the 17 groups of compounds studied, organophosphate insecticides constituted 99% acceptable daily intake (ADI). The results indicate that the occurrence of pesticide residues in apples could not be considered a serious public health problem.

25175039,"An LC-MS/MS ""dilute and shoot"" method for the determination of 295 fungal and bacterial metabolites was optimized and validated according to the guidelines established in the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs of the European Commission (SANCO) document No. 12495/2011. Four different types of food matrices were chosen for validation: apple puree for infants (high water content), hazelnuts (high fat content), maize (high starch and low fat content) and green pepper (difficult or unique matrix). Method accuracy and precision was evaluated using spiked samples in five replicates at two concentration levels. Method trueness was demonstrated through participation in various proficiency tests. Although the method covers a total number of 331 analytes, validation data were acquired only for 295 analytes, either due to the non-availability of analytical standards or due other reasons described in this paper. Concerning the apparent recovery, the percentage of 295 analytes matching the acceptable recovery range of 70-120% lied down by SANCO varied from 21% in green pepper to 74% in apple puree at the highest spiking level. At the levels close to limit of quantification only 20-58% of the analytes fulfilled this criterion. The extent of matrix effects was strongly dependent on the analyte/matrix combination. In general, the lowest matrix effects were observed in apple puree (59% of analytes were not influenced by enhancement/suppression at all at the highest validation level). The highest matrix effects were observed in green pepper, where only 10% of analytes did not suffer from signal suppression/enhancement. The repeatability of the method was acceptable (RSD≤20) for 97% of all analytes in apple puree and hazelnuts, for 95% in maize and for 89% in green pepper. Concerning the trueness of the method, Z-scores were generally between -2 and 2, despite a broad variety of different matrices. Based on these results it can be concluded that quantitative determination of mycotoxins by LC-MS/MS based on a ""dilute and shoot"" approach is also feasible in case of complex matrices.

By bioassay guide of tyrosinase inhibitory activity, the main active compound was isolated and purified from 50% methanol extract of pine needles of C. deodara through macroporous resin Diaion HP-20 column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. Based on mass and nuclear magnetic resonance data, the active compound was identified as 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin, which showed the potent monophenolase and diphenolase inhibitory activities. Moreover, 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin exhibited a strong ABTS radical scavenging activity with a dose-dependent manner. The antibrowning efficacy of 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin was evaluated by monitoring the changes of L*, a*, and b* values and total color difference (△E) on fresh-cut apple slices. It was found that 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin was effective in inhibiting the browning of apple slices treated with a concentration as low as 0.05% at 25 °C for 24 h. Its antibrowning effect was significantly better than ascorbic acid (0.5%) alone. Furthermore, 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin showed a good synergistic antibrowning effect with ascorbic acid.

25146528,"Despite the relationship between melatonin and aging, the overall changes and regulation of proteome profiling by long-term melatonin exposure during leaf senescence is not well understood. In this study, leaf senescence in Malus hupehensis plants was delayed when exogenous melatonin was regularly applied to the roots for 2 months compared with natural leaf senescence. Proteins of samples 0 and 50 day for both treatments were extracted and labeled with TMT regents before being examined via NanoLC-MS/MS. The proteomics data showed that 622 and 309 proteins were altered by senescence and melatonin, respectively. Our GO analysis by Blast2GO revealed that most of the altered proteins that are involved in major metabolic processes exhibited hydrolase activity and were mainly located in the plastids. These proteins were classified into several senescence-related functional categories, including degradation of macromolecules, redox and stress responses, transport, photosynthesis, development, and other regulatory proteins. We found that melatonin treatment led to the downregulation of proteins that are normally upregulated during senescence. The melatonin-related delay in senescence might have occurred due to the altering of proteins involved in processes associated with senescence. And as well, there are many unknown regulatory proteins possibly being involved in the melatonin's function.

Effects of different cytokinin regimes including different types of aromatic cytokinins, such as benzyl-adenine, benzyl-adenine riboside and 3-hydroxy-benzyladenine alone or in combination were studied on the capacity of the photosynthetic apparatus and the pigment content of in vitro apple leaves after 3 weeks of culture. We found that the type of cytokinins affected both chlorophyll a and b contents and its ratio. Chlorophyll content of in vitro apple leaves was the highest when benzyl-adenine was applied as a single source of cytokinin in the medium (1846-2176 μg/1g fresh weight (FW) of the leaf). Increasing the concentration of benzyl-adenine riboside significantly decreased the chlorophyll content of the leaves (from 1923 to 1183 μg/1g FW). The highest chl a/chl b ratio was detected after application of meta-topolin (TOP) at concentrations of 2.0 and 6.0 μM (2.706 and 2.804).

25050385,"Using static chambers and gas chromatography, nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from an apple orchard soil in the Bohai Bay region of China were measured from February 2010 to February 2011. In this study, two nitrogen (N) fertilizer treatments were designed--without (CK) or with (SN) synthetic N fertilizers (800 kg N ha(-1)). The annual cumulative N2O emissions from CK and SN were 34.6 ± 3.0 (mean ± standard error) and 44.3 ± 6.0 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively. Such high emissions resulted from the intensive N fertilization in the experimental and previous years. The direct emission factor (EFd) of N2O induced by the applied synthetic N fertilizers was 1.2%. The EFd is within the range of previous studies carried out in other croplands, which suggests that it is reasonable to estimate regional N2O emissions from apple orchards using the EFd obtained in other croplands.

25047819,"The ""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe"" (QuEChERS) approach to sample preparation is widely applied in pesticide residue analysis, but the use of magnesium sulfate and other nonvolatile compounds for salting out in the method is not ideal for mass spectrometry. In this study, we developed and evaluated three new different versions of the QuEChERS method using more volatile salts (ammonium chloride and ammonium formate and acetate buffers) to induce phase separation and extraction of 43 representative pesticide analytes of different classes. Fast low-pressure gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LPGC-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS were used for analysis. The QuEChERS AOAC Official Method 2007.01 was also tested for comparison purposes. Of the studied methods, formate buffering using 7.5g of ammonium formate and 15mL of 5% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile for the extraction of 15g of sample (5g for wheat grain) provided the best performance and practical considerations. Method validation was carried out with and without the use of dispersive solid-phase extraction for cleanup, and no significant differences were observed for the majority of pesticides. The method was demonstrated in quantitative analysis for GC- and LC-amenable pesticides in 4 representative food matrices (apple, lemon, lettuce, and wheat grain). With the typical exceptions of certain pH-dependent and labile pesticides, 90-110% recoveries and <10% RSD were obtained.

P. caribbica showed susceptibility to the oxidative stress in vitro test, and 250 μg/mL VC treatment improved its oxidative stress tolerance. The higher viability exhibited by VC-treated yeast was associated with a lower intracellular ROS level. The activities of antioxidant enzymes of P. caribbica were improved by VC treatment, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Additionally, VC-treated yeast exhibited greater biocontrol activity against P. expansum and faster growth when stored at 25 and 4 °C, respectively, compared to the performance of the non-VC-treated yeast. In response to the VC treatment under oxidative stress, several differentially expressed proteins were identified in P. caribbica, and most of the poteins were confirmed to be related to basic metabolism. Therefore, the application of ascorbic acid is a useful approach to improve oxidative stress tolerance of P. caribbica and its biocontrol efficacy on apples.

However, their combined effects are not well documented. It was hypothesized that the beneficial properties of quercetin glycosides can be enhanced when provided in combination with n-3 PUFA. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of apple flavonols (AF) and fish oil (FO), alone and in combination, on proinflammatory biomarkers and lipid profiles in rats fed a high-fat diet. Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 12) and fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks. One of the 5 groups of rats was used as the high-fat control. The other 4 groups of rats were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally, 5 hours before euthanization. One of these 4 groups was used as the hypercholerolemic and inflammatory control (high-fat with lipopolysaccharide [HFL]), and the other 3 received AF (HFL + 25 mg/kg per day AF), FO (HFL + 1 g/kg per day FO), or the combination (HFL + AF + FO). Compared to the HFL group, the AF, FO, and AF + FO groups showed lower serum concentrations of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The AF, FO, and AF + FO also had lowered serum triacylglycerol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations, but higher HDL-C levels relative to the HFL group. An additive effect was observed on serum CRP in the AF + FO group as compared with the AF or FO groups. The results demonstrated that AF and FO inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediators and showed an improved efficacy to lower serum CRP when administered in combination, and they significantly improved blood lipid profiles in rats with diet-induced hyperlipidemia and LPS-induced acute inflammation.","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)","['D000208', 'D052242', 'D000818', 'D015415', 'D001835', 'D002097', 'D008076', 'D059305', 'D015525', 'D005395', 'D044948', 'D006937', 'D007249', 'D007371', 'D016753', 'D015850', 'D008070', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D027845', 'D009929', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D053719', 'D014280', 'D014409']","['Acute Disease', 'Adiponectin', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Body Weight', 'C-Reactive Protein', 'Cholesterol, HDL', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3', 'Fish Oils', 'Flavonols', 'Hypercholesterolemia', 'Inflammation', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-6', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Malus', 'Organ Size', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triglycerides', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",Apple flavonols and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich fish oil lowers blood C-reactive protein in rats with hypercholesterolemia and acute inflammation.,"[None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000097', 'Q000009', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000188', 'Q000188', 'Q000097', 'Q000097', 'Q000097', 'Q000008', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000097', 'Q000097']","[None, 'blood', None, 'blood', None, 'metabolism', 'blood', 'adverse effects', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'drug therapy', 'drug therapy', 'blood', 'blood', 'blood', 'administration & dosage', 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'blood', 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026921,2015

24944043,"'Soggy breakdown' (SB) is an internal flesh disorder of 'Honeycrisp' apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) fruit that occurs during low temperature storage. The disorder is a chilling injury (CI) in which visible symptoms typically appear after several weeks of storage, but information about the underlying metabolism associated with its induction and development is lacking. The metabolic profile of flesh tissue from wholly healthy fruit and brown and healthy tissues from fruit with SB was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and correlation networks revealed correlation among ester volatile compounds by composition and differences in phytosterol, phenolic and putative triacylglycerides (TAGs) metabolism among the tissues. anova-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) was used to test the significance of metabolic changes linked with tissue health status. ASCA-significant components included antioxidant compounds, TAGs, and phytosterol conjugates. Relative to entirely healthy tissues, elevated metabolite levels in symptomatic tissue included γ-amino butyric acid, glycerol, sitosteryl (6'-O-palmitoyl) β-d-glucoside and sitosteryl (6'-O-stearate) β-d-glucoside, and TAGs containing combinations of 16:0, 18:3, 18:2 and 18:1 fatty acids. Reduced metabolite levels in SB tissue included 5-caffeoyl quinate, β-carotene, catechin, epicatechin, α-tocopherol, violaxanthin and sitosteryl β-d glucoside. Pathway analysis indicated aspects of primary metabolism differed according to tissue condition, although differences in metabolites involved were more subtle than those of some secondary metabolites.

24877980,"For multi-residue analysis of pesticides in food, a sufficient clean-up is essential for avoiding matrix effects in liquid and gas chromatography (LC and GC) analysis coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). In the last two years, high-throughput planar solid phase extraction (HTpSPE) was established as a new clean-up concept for pesticide residue analysis in fruits and vegetables (C. Oellig, W. Schwack, 2011) and tea (C. Oellig, W. Schwack, 2012). HTpSPE results in matrix-free extracts almost free of interferences and matrix effects. In this study, a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) was applied to directly analyze HTpSPE extracts for pesticide residues. This HTpSPE-microliter-flow injection analysis (μL-FIA)-TOFMS approach detects all pesticides at once in a single mass spectrum, without a liquid chromatographic separation step. Complete sample information was obtained after the injection of the cleaned extract within a single peak. Recovery studies for seven representative pesticides in four different matrices (apples, red grapes, cucumbers, tomatoes) provided mean recoveries of 86-116% with relative standard deviations of 1.3-10% (n=5) using the mass signal intensities under the entire sample peak. Comparing the mass spectra of sample peaks from spiked extracts and solvent standards indicated the efficiency of HTpSPE clean-up. A pesticide database search detected all spiked pesticides with a low incidence of false-positives. HTpSPE of one sample required a few minutes, and numerous samples could be cleaned in parallel at minimal cost with low sample and solvent consumption. The μL-FIA-TOFMS screening then needed an additional 6min per sample. The novel screening approach was successfully applied to QuEChERS extracts of several real samples, and the pesticides identified by HTpSPE-μL-FIA-TOFMS were identical to the pesticides detected by common target LC-MS/MS analyses. The high degree of concordantly identified pesticides by the new developed HTpSPE-μL-FIA-TOFMS approach and target LC-MS/MS demonstrates the applicability as a routine screening method.

24845356,"U.S. food imports have been increasing steadily for decades, intensifying the need for a rapid and sensitive screening technique. A method has been developed that uses foam disks to sample the surface of incoming produce. This work provides complimentary information to the extensive amount of published pesticide fragmentation data collected using LCMS systems (Sack et al. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 59, 6383-6411, 2011; Mol et al. Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 403, 2891-2908, 2012). The disks are directly analyzed using transmission-mode direct analysis in real time (DART) ambient pressure desorption ionization coupled to a high resolution accurate mass-mass spectrometer (HRAM-MS). In order to provide more certainty in the identification of the pesticides detected, a library of accurate mass fragments and isotopes of the protonated parent molecular ion (the [M+H]⁺) has been developed. The HRAM-MS is equipped with a quadrupole mass filter, providing the capability of ""data-dependent"" fragmentation, as opposed to ""all -ion"" fragmentation (where all of the ions enter a collision chamber and are fragmented at once). A temperature gradient for the DART helium stream and multiple collision energies were employed to detect and fragment 164 pesticides of varying chemical classes, sizes, and polarities. The accurate mass information of precursor ([M+H]⁺ ion) and fragment ions is essential in correctly identifying chemical contaminants on the surface of imported produce. Additionally, the inclusion of isotopes of the [M+H]⁺ in the database adds another metric to the confirmation process. The fragmentation data were collected using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer and were added to a database used to process data collected with an Exactive mass spectrometer, an instrument that is more readily available for this screening application. The commodities investigated range from smooth-skinned produce such as apples to rougher surfaces like broccoli.

Oppositely charged TGA-CdTe-QDs and CS-AuNPs can form FRET donor-acceptor assemblies due to electrostatic interactions, which effectively quench the fluorescence intensity of TGA-CdTe-QDs. The presence of glyphosate could induce the aggregation of CS-AuNPs through electrostatic interactions, resulting in the fluorescence recovery of the quenched QDs. This FRET-based method has been successfully utilized to detect glyphosate in apples with satisfactory results. The detection limit for glyphosate was 9.8 ng/kg (3σ), with the linear range of 0.02-2.0 μg/kg.

24828980,"An atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source has been used to enhance the potential of gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry (MS) for screening and quantification purposes in pesticide residue analysis. A screening method developed in our laboratory for around 130 pesticides has been applied to fruit and vegetable samples, including strawberries, oranges, apples, carrots, lettuces, courgettes, red peppers, and tomatoes. Samples were analyzed together with quality control samples (at 0.05 mg/kg) for each matrix and for matrix-matched calibration standards. The screening strategy consisted in first rapid searching and detection, and then a refined identification step using the QTOF capabilities (MS(E) and accurate mass). Identification was based on the presence of one characteristic m/z ion (Q) obtained with the low collision energy function and at least one fragment ion (q) obtained with the high collision energy function, both with mass errors of less than 5 ppm, and an ion intensity ratio (q/Q) within the tolerances permitted. Following this strategy, 15 of 130 pesticides were identified in the samples. Afterwards, the quantitation capabilities were tested by performing a quantitative validation for those pesticides detected in the samples. To this aim, five matrices were selected (orange, apple, tomato, lettuce, and carrot) and spiked at two concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg), and quantification was done using matrix-matched calibration standards (relative responses versus triphenyl phosphate used as an internal standard). Acceptable average recoveries and relative standard deviations were obtained for many but not all pesticide-matrix combinations. These figures allowed us to perform a retrospective quantification of positives found in the screening without the need for additional analysis. Taking advantage of the accurate-mass full-spectrum data provided by QTOF MS, we searched for a higher number of compounds (up to 416 pesticides) in a second stage by performing extra data processing without any new sample injection. Several more pesticides were detected, confirmed, and/or tentatively identified when the reference standard was unavailable, illustrating in this way the potential of gas chromatography-QTOF MS to detect pesticides in addition to the ones targeted in quantitative analysis of pesticides in food matrices.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D001274', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D010573', 'D014675']","['Atmospheric Pressure', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Vegetables']",Screening and quantification of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables making use of gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828980,2015

The P/B samples contained only low levels of diisopropylnaphthalene (DiPN) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) and so the experiments were conducted after impregnating the P/B with added model substances. These were o-xylene, acetophenone, dodecane, benzophenone, DiPN and DiBP. Migration levels depended strongly on the nature of the substance and on the nature of the food and much less on the characteristics of the P/B, except insofar as they affected the contact area - flexible papers giving more extensive contact with the food than thick rigid board. Migration into Tenax was at least a factor of 10 higher than migration into the fresh fruit and vegetables. The food samples were placed in contact with the P/B and then overwrapped loosely with aluminium foil and so this correction factor will tend to be conservative compared with a more open storage of the packed foods. Washing, peeling or cooking the fruits and vegetables after contact with the P/B had a surprisingly small effect on contaminant levels in general, and no one processing step was effective in giving a significant reduction of all the types of chemicals studied. This was because either they had penetrated into the food (so resisting peeling), or were not freely water-soluble (so resisting washing) or were not particularly volatile (so resisting loss by evaporation during cooking).","Food additives & contaminants.

This causative agent of the apple proliferation colonizes in Malus domestica the sieve tubes of the plant phloem resulting in a range of symptoms such as witches'--broom formation, reduced vigor and affecting size and quality of the crop. The disease is responsible for strong economical losses in Europe. Although the genome sequence of the pathogen is available, there is only limited information on expression of selected genes and metabolic key features that have not been examined on the transcriptomic or proteomic level so far. This situation is similar to many other phytoplasmas. In the work presented here, RNA-Seq and mass spectrometry shotgun techniques were applied on tissue samples from Nicotiana occidentalis infected by 'Ca. P. mali' strain AT providing insights into transcriptome and proteome of the pathogen. Data analysis highlights expression of 208 genes including 14 proteins located in the terminal inverted repeats of the linear chromosome. Beside a high portion of house keeping genes, the recently discussed chaperone GroES/GroEL is expressed. Furthermore, gene expression involved in formation of a type IVB and of the Sec-dependent secretion system was identified as well as the highly expressed putative pathogenicity-related SAP11-like effector protein. Metabolism of phytoplasmas depends on the uptake of spermidine/putescine, amino acids, co-factors, carbohydrates and in particular malate/citrate. The expression of these transporters was confirmed and the analysis of the carbohydrate cycle supports the suggested alternative energy-providing pathway for phytoplasmas releasing acetate and providing ATP.

Since not only fruit from organic farming, but also conventionally grown fruit is used for baby food production, the occurrence of pesticide residues in the final product is of high concern. To learn more about the fate of these hazardous compounds during processing of contaminated raw material, apples containing altogether 21 pesticide residues were used for preparation of a baby food purée both in the household and at industrial scale (in the baby food production facility). Within both studies, pesticide residues were determined in raw apples as well as in final products. Intermediate product and by-product were also analysed during the industrial process. Determination of residues was performed by a sensitive multi-detection analytical method based on liquid or gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The household procedure involved mainly the cooking of unpeeled apples, and the decrease of residues was not extensive enough for most of the studied pesticides; only residues of captan, dithianon and thiram dropped significantly (processing factors less than 0.04). On the other hand, changes in pesticide levels were substantial for all tested pesticides during apple processing in the industrial baby food production facility.

Here, we examined the relationship between toxin production and the pathogenicity of Vmm strains and determined their bioactivities in several assays, for further elucidating the pathogenesis mechanisms of Vmm and for developing new procedures to control this disease. The toxins were quantified with the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, and the results showed that the strain with attenuated virulence produced low levels of toxins with only three to four kinds of compounds being detectable. In contrast, higher amounts of toxins were produced by the more aggressive strain, and all five compounds were detected. This indicated a significant correlation between the pathogenicity of Vmm strains and their ability to produce toxins. However, this correlation only existed in planta, but not in vitro. During the infection of Vmm, protocatechuic acid was first detected at three days post inoculation (dpi), and the others at seven or 11 dpi.

24592995,"The ability of foods and beverages to reduce allyl methyl disulfide, diallyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, and allyl methyl sulfide on human breath after consumption of raw garlic was examined. The treatments were consumed immediately following raw garlic consumption for breath measurements, or were blended with garlic prior to headspace measurements. Measurements were done using a selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometer. Chlorophyllin treatment demonstrated no deodorization in comparison to the control. Successful treatments may be due to enzymatic, polyphenolic, or acid deodorization. Enzymatic deodorization involved oxidation of polyphenolic compounds by enzymes, with the oxidized polyphenols causing deodorization. This was the probable mechanism in raw apple, parsley, spinach, and mint treatments. Polyphenolic deodorization involved deodorization by polyphenolic compounds without enzymatic activity. This probably occurred for microwaved apple, green tea, and lemon juice treatments. When pH is below 3.6, the enzyme alliinase is inactivated, which causes a reduction in volatile formation. This was demonstrated in pH-adjusted headspace measurements. However, the mechanism for volatile reduction on human breath (after volatile formation) is unclear, and may have occurred in soft drink and lemon juice breath treatments.

The method is based on hypochlorite oxidation and ChE inhibition assay. Four common representative samples of produce were selected from a supermarket to investigate the effect of different matrices on pesticides recoveries and assay precision. The samples were extracted with acetonitrile to prepare them for ChE inhibition assays: if necessary, clean-up was performed using dispersive solid-phase extraction for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses. Chlorine was tested as an oxidising reagent for the conversion of thiophosphorus pesticides (P=S compounds) into their P=O analogues, which have high ChE-inhibiting activity. Chlorine consumption of individual acetonitrile extracts was determined and was strongly dependent on the individual types of fruits and vegetables. After treating the acetonitrile extracts with an excess hypochlorite at 25°C for 15 min, the ChE-inhibiting activities and detection limits for each chlorine-treated pesticide solution were determined. Matrix composition did not interfere significantly with the determination of the pesticides. Enhanced anti-ChE activities leading to low detection limits (ppb levels) were observed for the chlorine-treated extracts that were spiked with chlorpyrifos, diazinon, fenitrothion, and isoxathion.

A metabolomics approach can be applied to discover biomarkers that can be used to trace food adulteration. A study was undertaken to discover novel, potential biomarkers for the rapid detection of the adulteration of fruit juices with cheaper alternatives. Pineapple, orange, grapefruit, apple, clementine, and pomelo were investigated. Untargeted metabolite fingerprinting was performed by UPLC-QToF MS with multivariate data analysis. Twenty-one differential metabolites were selected, contributing to the separation between pineapple, orange and grapefruit juices, and their admixtures down to 1% adulteration level.

Our results demonstrated that the application of OGE is an effective method for peptide fractionation and increased significantly the number of proteins identified by at least ten times, with more total peptides detected and collected. Furthermore, we developed a protocol combining OGE and MRM studies to identify and quantitatively investigate monodehydroascorbate reductase, a key enzyme in the redox and antioxidant system of apple fruit during fruit ripening.

Studies of P. canaliculata using conventional biochemical and the individual gene approaches have revealed the expressional changes of several enzymes and antioxidative genes in response to estivation and arousal. In this study, we applied iTRAQ-coupled two-dimensional LC-MS/MS to identify and quantify the global protein expression during the estivation and arousal of P. canaliculata. A total of 1040 proteins were identified, among which 701 proteins were quantified and compared across four treatments (i.e., control, active snails; short-term estivation, 3 days of exposure to air; prolonged estivation, 30 days of exposure to air; and arousal, 6 h after resubmergence in water) revealing 53 differentially expressed proteins. A comparison of protein expression profiles across treatments indicated that the proteome of this species was very insensitive to initial estivation, with only 9 proteins differentially expressed as compared with the control. Among the 9 proteins, the up-regulations of two immune related proteins indicated the initial immune response to the detection of stress cues. Prolonged estivation resulted in many more differentially expressed proteins (47 compared with short-term estivation treatment), among which 16 were down-regulated and 31 were up-regulated. These differentially expressed proteins have provided the first global picture of a shift in energy usage from glucose to lipid, prevention of protein degradation and elevation of oxidative defense, and production of purine for uric acid production to remove toxic ammonia during prolonged estivation in a freshwater snail. From prolonged estivation to arousal, only 6 proteins changed their expression level, indicating that access to water and food alone is not a necessary condition to reactivate whole-sale protein expression.

24074739,"It has recently been suggested that fiber exerts a considerable effect on microbiota composition and on fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, the concentration of which in the colon is important for immune regulation and for maintaining gut and overall health. To test the hypothesis that the fiber consumed in a regular diet affects fecal SCFA concentrations in the elderly, the authors investigated the association between different types of fiber intake and fecal SCFA concentrations in 32 institutionalized elderly subjects aged between 76 and 95 years. Food intake was recorded by means of a validated food frequency questionnaire. Total, soluble (pectin and hemicellulose) and insoluble (pectin, hemicellulose, Klason lignin, and cellulose) fiber was determined using Marlett Food Composition Tables. Analysis of acetic, propionic, and butyric acid concentrations was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Potato intake was directly associated with SCFA concentrations and apple intake with propionate concentration. Of the fibers, cellulose showed an independent association with acetate and butyrate concentrations, and insoluble pectin explained a part of the variation in propionate. In conclusion, our results provide further evidence regarding the relation between diet and SCFA concentration in the elderly. The identification of an association between the regular intake of foods such as potatoes and the production of SCFAs provides an opportunity to improve public health.

The capacity of patulin was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that Ca-alginate-AC beads have significant ability to reduce patulin from contaminated apple juice. Furthermore, the adsorption process did not affect the quality of apple juice. The effects of contact time, initial patulin concentration, adsorbent dose, and temperature were assessed. The removal percentage of patulin increased with contact time, adsorbent dose, and temperature. A reduction was also noted to bind patulin at increased levels of contamination. The equilibrium data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm models and the isotherm constants were calculated at different temperatures. The adsorption equilibrium was best described by the Freundlich isotherm (R(2) > 0.990). The pseudo 1st-order model was found to describe the kinetic data satisfactorily.

The use of ESI source caused strong signal suppression in samples; however, matrix effect was negligible using APCI, allowing quantification with calibration standards prepared in solvent. The method was validated in four different apple matrices (juice, fruit, puree and compote) at two concentrations at the low μgkg(-1) level.

Commercially available fiber coatings were evaluated by investigating the extraction efficiency and desorption carryover. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry was selected to map out the differences between the coatings. The investigated components were chosen to represent several homologous groups of metabolites most frequently present in complex food and environmental samples, including straight-chain hydrocarbons, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, 2-ketones, aldehydes, ethyl esters, and terpenes. Particular emphasis was placed on examination of coating saturation and interanalyte displacements. These effects were assessed by evaluating the linear dynamic range obtained for spiked aqueous samples with divinylbenzene/Carboxen/poly(dimethylsiloxane) fiber. This coating was found to provide the optimum extraction coverage and sensitivity for the widest range of analytes. Displacement investigations were extended to apple homogenate characterized by high chemical diversity. The results indicate that interanalyte displacements are infrequent in the naturally occurring samples considered in this study. When displacements take place, they tend to occur for analytes characterized by small distribution constants, and they can be effectively detected by adding such compounds to the sample and corrected by selecting a shorter extraction time.

The UHPLC chromatographic system was chosen to separate polyphenolic compounds, and quantifications were then simultaneously performed with a UV-PDA detector and an ESI-triple quadrupole mass analyzer (SRM mode). Both quantification methods were validated for 15 major compounds using two apple juice samples, on the basis of linearity, limits of detection and quantification, recovery and precision tests. The comparison between UV and SRM quantifications in 120 different samples of a cider apple progeny showed an excellent correlation for major compounds quantified with both methods. However, an overestimation was revealed for five compounds with the UV detector and the mass analyzer. Co-elution and matrix effects are discussed to explain this phenomenon. SRM methods should therefore be considered with restrictions in some cases for quantification measurements when several phenolic compounds are simultaneously quantified in complex matrices such as apple juices.

According to the results, adults did not show a behavioral response to red, yellow, purple, or white artificial flowers without food odors, but flowers with the fermented pear juice strongly attracted them, and they showed a behavioral response to fermented juices of the six fruits (pear, apple, banana, watermelon, orange, and persimmon) with no statistically significant preference. The fruit volatiles were collected using dynamic headspace adsorption, and the volatile components were analyzed by auto thermal-desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to assess which volatiles existed in the fruits. Only alcohols, esters, and ketones were common in the volatiles of all six fermenting fruits. The five volatile components found in the six fruits, as well as two others found to be in other fermented foods by previous studies, were selected to test the behavioral and electroantennogram (EAG) responses of naive adults to estimate behavioral preference and antennal perception. In field behavioral tests, alcohols were the most attractive, followed by esters, while α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were much less attractive. Relative to other volatile combinations and ethanol alone, the mixture of ethyl acetate and ethanol attracted the most feeding adults. The number of adults attracted was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of both ethanol and ethyl acetate. The EAG responses of naive adults showed that the EAG responses to 3-methyl-1-butanol, isoamyl acetate, ethyl acetate, α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were all higher than those to ethanol (100%) at doses of either 5 µl/mL or 50 µl/mL. Sexual differences only existed in 3-methyl-1-butanol and acetic acid at particular concentrations. Sexual differences in response to chemical mixtures were not significant at 50 µl/mL.

Recovery at 100 μg L(-1) CN(-) was 100.5±0.1% and LOD and LOQ were 8 and 22 μg L(-1), respectively. The conditions for ninhydrin reagent preparation were discussed. The extraction and separation solutions, extraction and incubation time, and solvent volume were also investigated for maximum recovery of total cyanogens. 0.1% NaHCO3 was used as an extraction solvent for cyanide formed after enzymatic hydrolysis of cyanogens. The procedure was suitable for samples containing more than 90 mg CN(-)/100 g sample. When cyanogen concentrations were lower, the resulted cyanide was separated by microdiffusion in a Conway cell. Water was used as a hydrolysis medium and a donor solvent, while 2% Na2CO3 as an absorbing solution.

23870934,"A procedure to detect whether carbon dioxide was added to French ciders has been developed. For this purpose, an optimised and simplified method is proposed to determine (13)C/(12)C isotope ratio of carbon dioxide (δ(13)C) in ciders. Three critical steps were checked: (1) influence of atmospheric CO2 remaining in the loaded vial, (2) impact of helium flush, (3) sampling speed. This study showed that atmospheric CO2 does not impact the measurement, that helium flush can lead to isotopic fractionation and finally, that a fractionation occurs only 5h after bottle opening. The method, without any other preparation, consists in sampling 0.2 mL of cold (4 °C) cider in a vial that is passed in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min at room temperature to enhance cider de-carbonation. The headspace CO2 is then analysed using the link Multiflow®-isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Each year, a data bank is developed by fermenting authentic apples juices in order to control cider authenticity. Over a four year span (2008-2011), the CO2 produced during the fermentation step was studied. This set of 61 authentic ciders, from various French production areas, was used to determine a δ(13)C value range of -22.59±0.92‰ for authentic ciders CO2 bubbles. 75 commercial ciders were analysed with this method. Most of the samples analysed present a gas δ(13)C value in the expected range. Nevertheless, some ciders have δ(13)C values outside the 3σ limit, revealing carbonation by technical CO2. This practice is not allowed for organic, ""Controlled Appellation of Origin"" ciders and ciders specifying natural carbonation on the label.",Food chemistry,"['D001628', 'D002245', 'D002247', 'D027845', 'D013058', 'D011786']","['Beverages', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Malus', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Quality Control']",Authenticity of carbon dioxide bubbles in French ciders through multiflow-isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurements.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23870934,2014

To simulate external feeding, larvae were contained in gas-permeable cages and distributed throughout loads of peaches, plums, nectarines (all Prunus spp.), apples (Malus spp.), raspberries (Rubus spp.), or grapes (Vitis spp.). Varying the applied MB dose and the differential sorption of MB by the loads resulted in a range of exposures, expressed as concentration x time cross products (CTs) that were verified by gas-chromatographic quantification of MB in chamber headspace over the course of each fumigation. CTs > or = 60 and > or = 72 mg liter(-1) h at 10.0 +/- 0.5 and 15.6 +/- 0.5 degrees C (x +/- s, average +/- SD), respectively, yielded complete mortality of approximately 6,200 larvae at each temperature. These confirmatory fumigations corroborate E. postvittana mortality data for the first time in relation to measured MB exposures and collectively comprise the largest number of larval specimens tested to date. In addition, akinetic model of MB sorption was developed for the quarantine fumigation of fresh fruit based on the measurement of exposures and how they varied across the fumigation trials.

Pesticide residues in the vegetables or fruits were extracted with acetonitrile in a disposable tube using a homogenizer, followed by salting out with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride in the presence of citrate salts for buffering. The extract was purified with a double-layered cartridge column (graphite carbon black/primary secondary amine silica gel; GCB/PSA). For citrus fruits a purification step with a C18 column was added (this column was connected to the GCB/PSA column). After removal of the solvent, the extract was resolved in methanol/water and analyzed by means of LC-MS/MS. The method was validated according to the method validation guideline of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan; recovery tests were performed on 8 kinds of vegetables and fruits [cabbage, cucumber, Japanese radish, onion, potato, spinach, Amanatsumikan (a citrus fruit) and apple] by fortification of 161 pesticide residues at the concentrations 0.01 and 0.05 μg/g (each concentration of pesticide residue was extracted from 2 samples on 5 separate days).

23859722,"Adulteration of fruit juices--by the addition of sugar or other less expensive fruit juices as well as preservatives, artificial sweeteners and colours--was tested for by using a developed screening method. The method employs hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) using electrospray ionisation in the negative mode and ultraviolet light detection. Different fruit juices can be differentiated by the content of marker compounds like sorbitol, certain phenolic molecules and their saccharide profile. This method was used to test 46 fruit juice samples from the retail market as well as 12 control samples. The study focused on the main types of fruit juices consumed on the South African market including apple, orange, grape and blends of these juices with other fruits like mango, pear and guava. Overall, the 46 samples tested mostly agreed with label claims. One grape juice sample was adulterated, probably with apple juice. Natamycin above the legal limits was found in two samples. In addition, two samples contained natamycin and one sample benzoate without it being indicated on the label. The method is well suited as a quick screening method for fruit juice adulteration and if used routinely would reduce fruit juice adulteration without the cost of the current array of tests needed for authenticity testing.","Food additives & contaminants.

The consumption of coffee correlated to several health benefits such as reducing the risk of human chronic diseases such as inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease owing to its antioxidant potential.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,"['D000975', 'D001628', 'D032701', 'D002726', 'D002934', 'D003069', 'D004032', 'D031283', 'D035264', 'D005511', 'D005638', 'D006801', 'D031239', 'D010636', 'D018515', 'D010946', 'D006109', 'D011801', 'D012677', 'D014675']","['Antioxidants', 'Beverages', 'Biomimetics', 'Chlorogenic Acid', 'Cinnamates', 'Coffee', 'Diet', 'Eucommiaceae', 'Flowers', 'Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Lonicera', 'Phenols', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Poaceae', 'Quinic Acid', 'Sensation', 'Vegetables']","An outlook on chlorogenic acids-occurrence, chemistry, technology, and biological activities.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000502', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'physiology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23768188,2014
23708281,"Naphthylacetic acid, naphthyloxy acetic acid and naphthylacetamide belong to a group of synthetic substances known as ""auxin-like"" compounds which are used as growth regulators in vegetables and fruits due to their structure similarities with the indoleacetic acid, the most important plant auxin. This paper reports a selective, sensitive and fast ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of naphthylacetamide (NAD) and the isomers (α and β) of naphthylacetic acid (NAA) and naphthyloxy acetic (NOA) acid in apple samples. A baseline separation between the respective isomers was achieved using an RP-Amide column with gradient elution. The UHPLC-MS/MS method developed, using electrospray and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition mode led to a reliable determination of these family of compounds in apple samples at low quantitation levels, down to 1.0 μg kg(-1) and 0.25 μg kg(-1) respectively. For confirmation of NAA accurate mass measurement is proposed giving at these conditions quantitation limits of 10 μg kg(-1) for this compound. The UHPLC-MS/MS method developed was used for the analysis of apple samples harvested in three different apple fields from Lleida (Spain) during the blooming period.

Wines were evaluated for antioxidant activity (AA) using the radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) method, total phenolic content (TPC) using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, total monomeric anthocyanins (TMAs) using the pH differential test, and color parameters using VIS-spectrophotometry. For blackberry wines, ellagitannins and anthocyanins were also analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD). Apples wines (n = 40) had the lowest TPC (608 ± 86 mg/L) and AA (2.1 ± 0.3 mM Trolox). Blueberry wines (n = 12) had high TPC (1086 ± 194 mg/L) and moderate AA (5.4 ± 0.8 mM) but very low TMA (8 ± 3 mg/L), with a color evolved toward yellow and blue shades. Blackberry wines (n = 10) had the highest TPC (1265 ± 91 mg/L) and AA (12 ± 1 mM). Ellagitannins were the major phenolics (1172 ± 115 mg/L) and correlated well with AA (r = 0.88). Within anthocyanins (TMA 73 ± 16 mg/L), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (62%) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (15%) were predominant. Wines obtained by cofermentation of apples and blackberries (n = 8) showed intermediate characteristics (TPC 999 ± 83 mg/L, AA 6.2 ± 0.7 mM, TMA 35 ± 22 mg/L) between the blackberry and blueberry wines.

23692760,"Consumer demand for pomegranate juice has considerably grown, during the last years, for its potential health benefits. Since it is an expensive functional food, cheaper fruit juices addition (i.e., grape and apple juices) or its simple dilution, or polyphenols subtraction are deceptively used. At present, time-consuming analyses are used to control the quality of this product. Furthermore these analyses are expensive and require well-trained analysts. Thus, the purpose of this study was to propose a high-speed and easy-to-use shortcut. Based on UV-VIS spectroscopy and chemometrics, a screening method is proposed to quickly screening some common fillers of pomegranate juice that could decrease the antiradical scavenging capacity of pure products. The analytical method was applied to laboratory prepared juices, to commercial juices and to representative experimental mixtures at different levels of water and filler juices. The outcomes were evaluated by means of multivariate exploratory analysis. The results indicate that the proposed strategy can be a useful screening tool to assess addition of filler juices and water to pomegranate juices.",Food chemistry,"['D001628', 'D055951', 'D029561', 'D015999', 'D011786', 'D013053', 'D013056']","['Beverages', 'Functional Food', 'Lythraceae', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Quality Control', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",A screening method based on UV-Visible spectroscopy and multivariate analysis to assess addition of filler juices and water to pomegranate juices.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23692760,2013

The optimized extraction method for determination of flavonols was at 120 °C and 3 min, giving a predicted total yield of flavonols of 1.3 μmol/g dry apple byproduct. Results obtained suggest that new antioxidant compounds were formed at the higher extraction temperatures. A desirability function response surface, considering maximum antioxidant capacity and minimal formation of brown color, was calculated and gave an optimum of 125 °C and 3 min.

We developed an immunochromatographic (ic) strip for the rapid detection of E. coli O26 in food samples. To determine the specificity of the IC strip, pure cultures of 67 E. coli and 22 non-E. coli strains were tested with the IC strip. The IC strip could detect all (18 of 18) E. coli O26 strains tested and did not react with strains of any other E. coli serogroup or non-E. coli strains tested (0 of 71). The minimum detection limits for E. coli O26 were 2.2 × 10(3) to 1.0 × 10(5) cfu/ml. To evaluate the ability of the IC strip to detect E. coli O26 in food, 25-g food samples (ground beef, beef liver, ground chicken, alfalfa sprout, radish sprout, spinach, natural cheese, and apple juice) were spiked with E. coli O26. The IC strip was able to detect E. coli O26 at very low levels (approximately 1 cfu/25 g of food samples) after an 18-h enrichment, and the IC strip results were in 100% agreement with the results of the culture method and pcr assay.

A single extraction was used to recover the five ATs by apple juices, beers, tomato sauces, olives and dried basil. Different Solid Phase Extractions (SPE) and clean-up were selected to optimise the purification step for each food matrix. Limits of detection and quantification were, respectively, in the range 0.16-12.31 and 0.54-41.04 ng g(-1). Recovery rates were generally above 70%, except for dried basil and olives. Thirty out of 70 samples analysed (7 apple juices, 14 beers and 9 tomato sauces) resulted positive to at least one alternaria toxin investigated.

23564293,"Codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is a major cosmopolitan pest of apple and other pome fruits. Ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate (pear ester) has been identified as a host-derived kairomone for female and male codling moths. However, pear ester has not performed similarly in different fruit production areas in terms of the relative magnitude of moth catch, especially the proportion of females caught. Our work was undertaken to identify host volatiles from apples, and to investigate whether these volatiles can be used to enhance the efficacy of host kairomone pear ester for monitoring female and male codling moths. Volatiles from immature apple trees were collected in the field using dynamic headspace sampling during the active period of codling moth flight. Using gas chromatography-electroantennogram detector (GC/EAD) analysis, six compounds elicited responses from antennae of females. These compounds were identified by GC/mass spectrometry (MS) and comparisons to authentic standards as nonanal, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, methyl salicylate, decanal, (Z,E)-α-farnesene, and (E,E)-α-farnesene. When the EAD-active compounds were tested individually in the field, no codling moths were caught except for a single male with decanal. However, addition of (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, methyl salicylate, decanal, or (E,E)-α-farnesene to pear ester in a binary mixture enhanced the efficacy of pear ester for attracting female codling moths compared to pear ester alone. Addition of the 6-component blend to the pear ester resulted in a significant increase in the number of males attracted, and enhanced the females captured compared to pear ester alone; the number of males and females caught was similar to that with the pear ester plus acetic acid combination lure. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to synergize the response of codling moth to host kairomone by using other host volatiles. The new apple-pear ester host kairomone blend should be helpful for monitoring female codling moth, and may provide the basis for further improvement of codling moth kairomone.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000818', 'D001522', 'D004952', 'D005260', 'D008297', 'D027845', 'D009036', 'D010675', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Esters', 'Female', 'Male', 'Malus', 'Moths', 'Pheromones', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Apple volatiles synergize the response of codling moth to pear ester.,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000494', None, None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000494', 'Q000494']","[None, 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', None, None, None, 'physiology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23564293,2013

The fruit samples collected at 10d interval and soil samples taken at harvest time were analyzed after second spray. The residual concentrations of trifloxystrobin, its acid metabolite CGA 321113 and tebuconazole were measured. Residues of both fungicides were determined by using gas chromatograph, Agilent 6890N having electron capture detector. The mean initial deposits of trifloxystrobin at four locations were found to be in the range of 0.333-0.387 mg kg(-1) and 0.512-0.714 mg kg(-1) at the application rate of 100 and 200 g a.i. ha(-1), and half-life were found between 19.38-24.93 d and 19.84-28.86 d at the respective doses. The Σ-trifloxystrobin and tebuconazole residues were below determination limit in 40 d apple fruits and soil samples.

The chemical and toxicological characteristics of heavy metals can have an impact on human health through several mechanisms. Other metals, on the other hand, are essential for maintenance of physiological and biochemical human processes, are protective against many diseases and must be present in the diet because they cannot be synthesized by the human body. The purpose of this study was to assess the presence of heavy metals and trace elements both in fruit and vegetable products widely consumed in the province of Catania (Sicily, Italy) and in various environmental matrices (air, water and land), and to investigate possible sources of contamination. Fruit and vegetable products (tomatoes, lettuce, spinach, eggplants, potatoes, zucchini, grapes, apples and pears) were sampled (n = 60) from the towns of Adrano, Biancavilla and Mazzarrone.

Of the 316 proteins, 219 spots were only present at a specific ripening stage, while 97 spots were significantly different (p<0.05) throughout fruit ripening and in response to ethylene treatment. From 316 candidate spots, 221 proteins were further identified by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis with protein sequence and express sequence tag (EST) data searching. Analysis and identification of proteins revealed that apple fruit ripening is associated with increase of abundance of many proteins with functions such as ethylene production, antioxidation and redox, carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative stress, energy, and defense response. Ethylene treatment increased a group of unique proteins that were not present during normal fruit ripening and have not been previously reported. It also reduced some proteins involved in primary metabolism, including those of the last few steps of the glycolytic pathway.

A mixture of 12 pesticides was applied to an apple tree; apples were collected after 10 days of application. After harvest, apples were treated with a mixture of three post-harvest pesticides and the fruits were then processed in order to obtain apple juice following a routine industrial process. The pesticide residue levels in the apple samples were analysed using two multi-residue methods based on LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. The concentration of pesticides was determined in samples derived from the different steps of processing. The processing factors (the coefficient between residue level in the processed commodity and the residue level in the commodity to be processed) obtained for the full juicing process were found to vary among the different pesticides studied. In order to investigate the relationships between the levels of pesticide residue found in apple juice samples and their physicochemical properties, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using two sets of samples (one of them using experimental data obtained in this work and the other including the data taken from the literature). In both cases the correlation was found between processing factors of pesticides in the apple juice and the negative logarithms (base 10) of the water solubility, octanol/water partition coefficient and organic carbon partition coefficient. The linear correlation between these physicochemical properties and the processing factor were established using a multiple linear regression technique.","Food additives & contaminants.

23256150,"Terpenes are specialized plant metabolites that act as attractants to pollinators and as defensive compounds against pathogens and herbivores, but they also play an important role in determining the quality of horticultural food products. We show that the genome of cultivated apple (Malus domestica) contains 55 putative terpene synthase (TPS) genes, of which only 10 are predicted to be functional. This low number of predicted functional TPS genes compared with other plant species was supported by the identification of only eight potentially functional TPS enzymes in apple 'Royal Gala' expressed sequence tag databases, including the previously characterized apple (E,E)-α-farnesene synthase. In planta functional characterization of these TPS enzymes showed that they could account for the majority of terpene volatiles produced in cv Royal Gala, including the sesquiterpenes germacrene-D and (E)-β-caryophyllene, the monoterpenes linalool and α-pinene, and the homoterpene (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. Relative expression analysis of the TPS genes indicated that floral and vegetative tissues were the primary sites of terpene production in cv Royal Gala. However, production of cv Royal Gala floral-specific terpenes and TPS genes was observed in the fruit of some heritage apple cultivars. Our results suggest that the apple TPS gene family has been shaped by a combination of ancestral and more recent genome-wide duplication events. The relatively small number of functional enzymes suggests that the remaining terpenes produced in floral and vegetative and fruit tissues are maintained under a positive selective pressure, while the small number of terpenes found in the fruit of modern cultivars may be related to commercial breeding strategies.",Plant physiology,"['D000080462', 'D019883', 'D001483', 'D000081008', 'D035264', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D020869', 'D015971', 'D018506', 'D023281', 'D027845', 'D008969', 'D039821', 'D005810', 'D010802', 'D010940', 'D000081223', 'D020133', 'D012689', 'D012717', 'D013045', 'D013729', 'D055549', 'D014835']","['Acyclic Monoterpenes', 'Alkyl and Aryl Transferases', 'Base Sequence', 'Bicyclic Monoterpenes', 'Flowers', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genomics', 'Malus', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monoterpenes', 'Multigene Family', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Proteins', 'Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Species Specificity', 'Terpenes', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Volatilization']",Functional genomics reveals that a compact terpene synthase gene family can account for terpene volatile production in apple.,"[None, 'Q000145', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000145', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000145', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'classification', None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'classification', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'classification', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256150,2013

23182936,"Gas and liquid chromatography (GC and LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) serve as the most powerful analytical tools commonly used to monitor pesticide residues in food, among other applications. However, both GC-MS and LC-MS are susceptible to matrix effects which can adversely affect quantification depending on the analyte, matrix, sample preparation, instrumentation, and operating conditions. Among the approaches that reduce matrix effects, the most common in pesticide residue applications is matrix-matched calibration because it is relatively inexpensive and simple. Also, it has been shown to work well during method validation when fortified samples are exactly matched with samples used for calibration. However, the quality of matrix-matched results in real-world analyses depends on the consistency of matrix effects among diverse samples. In this study, the variability of matrix effects was measured for 38 representative pesticides in 20 samples each (including different varieties) of rice, orange, apple, and spinach extracted using the ""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe"" (QuEChERS) method for analysis by LC-MS/MS and low-pressure GC-MS. Using LC-MS/MS, only oranges gave >20% matrix effects for a few pesticides. GC-MS exhibited larger matrix effects, but as in LC-MS/MS, the differences were reasonably consistent among the 20 samples tested. Main conclusions of this study are that for the conditions utilized: (1) matrix-matching was not needed for most pesticides in the simpler food matrices; and (2) for the more complex orange matrix, acceptably accurate quantitative results were achieved by using matrix-matching even with a different sample of the same type.

Sensory analyses are usually carried out with various tannin fractions isolated from food or beverage, and their interpretation are limited by the lack of knowledge in the fine and accurate molecular composition of the tannin fractions. Besides, the studies of the chemical reactivity conducted in model solutions with 'simple' flavanols allow a better understanding of their evolution pathways, but they cannot take into account their reactivity as polymers, specifically regarding oxidation. In particular, competition between intramolecular and intermolecular reactions may strongly impact on the tannin structures (size, branching and conformation) and consequently on their properties. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry electrospray ionization mass spectrometer analytical method was thus developed in order to identify oxidized tannins generated by autoxidation. Given the difficulties to separate and detect tannins with high DP, samples were depolymerized by chemical depolymerization prior to analysis. Since the linkages created by oxidation are not cleavable in the usual depolymerization conditions (contrarily to the original interflavanic linkages), specific oxidation residues are released from tannins structures after their autoxidation. Oxidation markers of both intermolecular and intramolecular mechanisms have been identified; these are mainly dimers and trimers, more or less oxidized, and some contain additional hydroxyl groups.

23096157,"Anthocyanin accumulation is coordinated in plants by a number of conserved transcription factors. In apple (Malus × domestica), an R2R3 MYB transcription factor has been shown to control fruit flesh and foliage anthocyanin pigmentation (MYB10) and fruit skin color (MYB1). However, the pattern of expression and allelic variation at these loci does not explain all anthocyanin-related apple phenotypes. One such example is an open-pollinated seedling of cv Sangrado that has green foliage and develops red flesh in the fruit cortex late in maturity. We used methods that combine plant breeding, molecular biology, and genomics to identify duplicated MYB transcription factors that could control this phenotype. We then demonstrated that the red-flesh cortex phenotype is associated with enhanced expression of MYB110a, a paralog of MYB10. Functional characterization of MYB110a showed that it was able to up-regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The chromosomal location of MYB110a is consistent with a whole-genome duplication event that occurred during the evolution of apple within the Maloideae family. Both MYB10 and MYB110a have conserved function in some cultivars, but they differ in their expression pattern and response to fruit maturity.",Plant physiology,"['D000872', 'D001483', 'D001947', 'D002851', 'D002874', 'D032461', 'D019143', 'D005638', 'D020440', 'D018506', 'D018745', 'D027845', 'D008969', 'D010641', 'D010802', 'D010858', 'D018515', 'D010940', 'D011401', 'D040641', 'D016415', 'D013045', 'D014026', 'D014157', 'D014158']","['Anthocyanins', 'Base Sequence', 'Breeding', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Plant', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Fruit', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genome, Plant', 'Malus', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Pigmentation', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Species Specificity', 'Tobacco', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",An ancient duplication of apple MYB transcription factors is responsible for novel red fruit-flesh phenotypes.,"['Q000096', None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None]","['biosynthesis', None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, 'genetics', None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23096157,2013
23077632,"Fibrillin4 (FBN4) is a protein component of plastoglobules, which are antioxidant-rich sub-compartments attached to the chloroplast thylakoid membranes. FBN4 is required for normal plant biotic and abiotic stress resistance, including bacterial pathogens, herbicide, high light intensity, and ozone; FBN4 is also required for the accumulation of osmiophilic material inside plastoglobules. In this study, the contribution of FBN4 to plastoglobule lipid composition was examined using cultivated apple trees in which FBN4 gene expression was knocked down using RNA interference. Chloroplasts and plastoglobules were isolated from leaves of wild-type and fbn4 knock-down trees. Total lipids were extracted from chloroplasts and plastoglobules separately, and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Three lipids were consistently present at lower levels in the plastoglobules from fbn4 knock-down apple leaves compared to the wild-type as determined by LC-MS multiple ion monitoring. One of these species had a molecular mass and fragmentation pattern that identified it as plastoquinone, a known major component of plastoglobules. The plastoquinone level in fbn4 knock-down plastoglobules was less than 10% of that in wild-type plastoglobules. In contrast, plastoquinone was present at similar levels in the lipid extracts of whole chloroplasts from leaves of wild-type and fbn4 knock-down trees. These results suggest that the partitioning of plastoquinone between the plastoglobules and the rest of the chloroplast is disrupted in fbn4 knock-down leaves. These results indicate that FBN4 is required for high-level accumulation of plastoquinone and some other lipids in the plastoglobule. The dramatic decrease in plastoquinone content in fbn4 knock-down plastoglobules is consistent with the decreased plastoglobule osmiophilicity previously described for fbn4 knock-down plastoglobules. Failure to accumulate the antioxidant plastoquinone in the fbn4 knock-down plastoglobules might contribute to the increased stress sensitivity of fbn4 knock-down trees.",PloS one,"['D000975', 'D002736', 'D000071837', 'D018506', 'D027845', 'D008840', 'D010788', 'D018515', 'D010971']","['Antioxidants', 'Chloroplasts', 'Fibrillins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Malus', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Photosynthesis', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plastoquinone']",Knockdown of FIBRILLIN4 gene expression in apple decreases plastoglobule plastoquinone content.,"['Q000378', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000378']","['metabolism', 'genetics', None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23077632,2013

However an important group of them provide much better response working in negative chemical ionization mode due to the elimination of a high percentage of background signal. Considering that a selective and sensitive method has been developed for the determination of multiclass pesticide residues in different commodities by GC-MS with a triple stage quadrupole analyzer (GC-TSQ-MS); the pesticide signal has been optimized in MS-MS whilst working in negative chemical ionization mode using methane as the reagent gas. The proposed method was fully validated for 53 compounds in tomato, apple and orange matrices. The obtained limits of determination were lower than 0.1 μg/kg for more than 50% of the pesticides studied, and lower than 1 μg/kg for all pesticides studied, except for cypermethrin, boscalid, bifenthrin and deltamethrin. Linearity was studied in the 0.5-50 μg/kg range and a linear response was obtained for all pesticides in all matrices. Recoveries were evaluated at two different levels (1 and 50 μg/kg) and recoveries were ranged between 70 and 120% in tomato, apple and orange, except in the cases of chlorfenapyr, ofurace, chlozolinate, chlorothalonil, tolylfluanid and dichlofluanid with recovery values close to 60% at 1 μg/kg fortification levels. Repetitivity was evaluated and the relative standard deviation (RSD%) was lower than 10% in all cases. The developed method was employed in the analysis of real samples intended for baby food and the obtained results showed that 50% of the samples were positive for different pesticide residues. The concentration range detected was between 5 and 100 μg/kg.

Textural (firmness, fracturability, flesh elasticity, and rupture) and physicochemical (pH, acidity, and water content) properties of the apples were also measured. Static headspace analysis of intact fruits revealed Fuji and Granny Smith apples had the lowest concentration for all measured flavor compounds (esters, aldehydes, alcohols, and terpenes), whereas Red Delicious apples had the highest. Fresh-cut samples generally showed a significant increase in total volatile compounds with acetaldehyde being most abundant.

The choice of optimal sample preparation step is one of the key conditions to achieve good performance characteristics. In this context, we investigated the possibility to expand the scope of the three multi-analyte extraction procedures employed earlier in other studies for rapid isolation of either pesticides or mycotoxins from plant matrices. Following procedures were tested: A - aqueous acetonitrile extraction followed by partition (QuEChERS-like method), B - aqueous acetonitrile extraction, and C - pure acetonitrile extraction. On the list of target analytes, we had 288 pesticides (including 'troublesome' acidic, basic and base-sensitive compounds) together with 38 mycotoxins (including all EU regulated ones and many 'emerging' toxins on the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) list). The matrices selected for the experiments, apple baby food, wheat flour, spices and sunflower seeds, represented various composition categories in terms of moisture, fat and extractable compounds (e.g. pigments and essential oils) content. In preliminary experiments, acceptable recoveries (70-120%) for most of analytes were obtained by the analysis of spiked matrices, regardless which extraction procedure was used. However, when analysing dry samples with incurred pesticide residues/mycotoxins, the method C did not enable efficient extraction of some common contaminants. Procedure A, thanks to a higher matrix equivalent compared to the method B and relatively less pronounced matrix effects, enabled lower quantification limits for all analyte/matrix combinations, with the exception of polar mycotoxins and/or pesticides.

During the DLLME, the effect of some experimental factors including extraction solvent and its volume, dispersion solvent and its volume, vortex time, salt addition, and pH on the extraction procedure were investigated. Under the chosen extraction conditions, the analytes were enriched more than 300-fold and the limits of detections were greatly dropped to 0.061-0.73 μg/kg.

Here, we investigate the origins of fruit odor discrimination for Rhagoletis pomonella underlying the fly's sympatric shift in the northeastern United States from downy hawthorn (Crataegus mollis) to apple (Malus domestica). Because R. pomonella mate on host fruit, preferences for natal fruit volatiles generate prezygotic isolation. Apples emit volatiles that appear to be missing from gas chromatography/electroantennographic detection profiles for flies infesting downy hawthorns, raising the question of how R. pomonella evolved a preference for apple. In the southern United States, R. pomonella attacks several native hawthorns. Behaviorally active volatile blends for R. pomonella infesting southern hawthorns contain the missing apple volatiles, potentially explaining why downy hawthorn flies could have evolved to be sensitive to a blend of apple volatiles. Flight tunnel assays imply that southern hawthorn populations were not the antecedent of a preassembled apple race, as southern flies were not attracted to the apple volatile blend. Instead, behavioral evidence was found for southern host races on native hawthorns, complementing the story of the historical sympatric shift to introduced apple in the North and illustrating how R. pomonella may evolve novel combinations of agonist and antagonist responses to volatiles to use new fruit resources.",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,"['D000818', 'D001522', 'D027825', 'D049810', 'D058507', 'D027845', 'D009812', 'D033621', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Crataegus', 'Genetic Speciation', 'Host Specificity', 'Malus', 'Odorants', 'Tephritidae', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",On the scent of standing variation for speciation: behavioral evidence for native sympatric host races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) in the southern United States.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'physiology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22946800,2013

22867437,"An ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography accurate mass quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (UHPLC-(ESI)QTOF MS/MS) method was developed for measuring individual quercetin metabolites in human plasma with high sensitivity and high selectivity. Quercetin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) occurs as glycosides in foods. The composition of glycosides is species and cultivar specific. In humans, quercetin undergoes extensive biotransformation, resulting in a range of metabolites. The bioactivity of quercetin metabolites will depend on the type and position of the conjugates. Herein, individual quercetin metabolites (i.e., sulfate, glucuronide or methyl conjugates) were identified by accurate mass MS in human plasma (females = 8 and males = 8) over 24 h after consumption of applesauce enriched with either micronized apple peel (AP) or onion powder (OP). The AP and OP contained ~180 μmol of quercetin glycosides. The relative amounts of quercetin metabolites were quantified in plasma. The complement of identified quercetin metabolites was similar after consumption of AP and OP. Primary metabolites included the following: quercetin sulfate, quercetin glucuronide, and quercetin diglucuronide. A quercetin glutathione adduct was identified in negative ion mode but not apparent in positive ion mode.

Response surface methodology was used to investigate the effects of processing parameters, including ultrasound power, extraction time, temperature, and ethanol concentration on total polyphenols yield and polyphenols composition was analyzed by HPLC. Antioxidant activity of the polyphenols was evaluated as 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydracyl scavenging activity and inhibition activity of lipid peroxidation. The results showed that 10-100 times higher total polyphenols yield was obtained from the unripe apple than those from the reported apple pomace. The optimum extraction conditions were ultrasonic power of 519.39 W, extraction time of 30 min, extraction temperature 50°C, ethanol concentration of 50% gave the total polyphenols yield of 13.26 ± 0.56 mg GAE/g. HPLC analysis indicated that (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin B2, chlorogenic acid, and procyanidin B1 were the predominant polyphenols in unripe apple, which contributed to the higher antioxidant activity to 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydracyl of unripe apple polyphenols than other apple polyphenols.

22797850,"The larva of codling moth Cydia pomonella (Tortricidae, Lepidoptera) is known as the worm in the apple, mining the fruit for food. We here show that codling moth larvae are closely associated with yeasts of the genus Metschnikowia. Yeast is an essential part of the larval diet and further promotes larval survival by reducing the incidence of fungal infestations in the apple. Larval feeding, on the other hand, enables yeast proliferation on unripe fruit. Chemical, physiological and behavioral analyses demonstrate that codling moth senses and responds to yeast aroma. Female moths are attracted to fermenting yeast and lay more eggs on yeast-inoculated than on yeast-free apples. An olfactory response to yeast volatiles strongly suggests a contributing role of yeast in host finding, in addition to plant volatiles. Codling moth is a widely studied insect of worldwide economic importance, and it is noteworthy that its association with yeasts has gone unnoticed. Tripartite relationships between moths, plants, and microorganisms may, accordingly, be more widespread than previously thought. It, therefore, is important to study the impact of microorganisms on host plant ecology and their contribution to the signals that mediate host plant finding and recognition.

In response to the ever increasing interest in development of reliable methods competent with obtaining a complete and accurate metabolomic snapshot for subsequent identification, quantification and profiling studies, the purpose of the current investigation is to test the feasibility of solid phase microextraction for advanced fingerprinting of volatile and semivolatile metabolites in complex samples. In particular, the current study is focussed on the development and optimization of solid phase microextraction (SPME) - comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-ToFMS) methodology for metabolite profiling of apples (Malus × domestica Borkh.). For the first time, GC × GC attributes in terms of molecular structure-retention relationships and utilization of two-dimensional separation space on orthogonal GC × GC setup were exploited in the field of SPME method optimization for complex sample analysis. Analytical performance data were assessed in terms of method precision when commercial coatings are employed in spiked metabolite aqueous sample analysis. The optimized method consisted of the implementation of direct immersion SPME (DI-SPME) extraction mode and its application to metabolite profiling of apples, and resulted in a tentative identification of 399 metabolites and the composition of a metabolite database far more comprehensive than those obtainable with classical one-dimensional GC approaches. Considering that specific metabolome constituents were for the first time reported in the current study, a valuable approach for future advanced fingerprinting studies in the field of fruit biology is proposed. The current study also intensifies the understanding of SPME-GC×GC-ToFMS hyphenation and outlines the benefits of facilitating GC×GC for SPME method optimization. The obtained results clearly illustrate that acquisition of a more complete metabolome snapshot is only attainable under optimized conditions for both techniques.",Journal of chromatography.

This transition is accompanied by a significant change in color, previously exploited for cyanide determination. The reagent OH(H(2)O)Cbi(+) is used in excess; when trace amounts of cyanide are added, CN(H(2)O)Cbi(+) should be formed. But the spectral absorption of CN(H(2)O)Cbi(+) is virtually the same as that of OH(H(2)O)Cbi(+). It has been inexplicable how trace amounts of cyanide are sensitively measured by this reaction. It is shown here that even with excess OH(H(2)O)Cbi(+), (CN)(2)Cbi is formed first due to kinetic reasons; this only slowly forms CN(H(2)O)Cbi(+). This understanding implies that CN(H(2)O)Cbi(+) will itself be a better reagent. We describe a single valve merging zone flow analyzer that allows both sample and reagent economy.

Cationic surfactants with different chain lengths (n = 12 and 16) were mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; n = 12) for the mixed anionic-cationic surfactants-based extraction. Six OPPs were studied including azinphos-methyl, parathion-methyl, fenitrothion, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, and prothiophos. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography was used for the determination of the studied OPPs. The extraction was performed using mixtures of SDS and cationic surfactants including dodecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide or dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB; n = 12) and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide or cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB; n = 16). The parameters affecting the extraction efficiencies of two extraction systems were studied and discussed. The optimum condition for SDS-DTAB was 15 mmol L(-1) SDS and 1 mmol L(-1) DTAB in the presence of 15% (w/v) sodium chloride (NaCl). Meanwhile, the condition for SDS-CTAB was 10 mmol L(-1) SDS and 1.0 mmol L(-1) CTAB with 10% (w/v) NaCl. Under the optimum conditions, the extraction efficiency of SDS-DTAB (66-85%) was slightly higher than that of SDS-CTAB (61-82%). In addition, the SDS-DTAB system also gave greater enrichment factor than SDS-CTAB for all the studied OPPs. This result may be due to the compatibility of chain length between SDS and DTAB. The extraction using SDS-DTAB was successfully applied to determine OPPs in fruit samples (i.e., pomelo, apple, and pineapple). No contamination by the studied OPPs in samples was observed.

The results indicated that the pesticide residue levels in the apple peel and core were higher compared with in the apple flesh. After peeled and cored apple was processed into apple juice and pomace, chlorpyrifos, β-cypermethrin and tebuconazole were concentrated in the apple pomace.

In order to decipher the mechanisms related to firmness of apples (Malus × domestica Borkh.), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to compare the total proteome of high and low firmness phenotypes from apple hypanthia of a 'Golden Delicious' × 'Dietrich' population. A total of 36 differentially regulated protein spots were positively identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and then validated against the Malus expressed sequence tags (EST) database. The findings of this study indicated a lower expression of ethylene biosynthesis related proteins in the high firmness phenotype, which could be linked to the slowing down of the ripening and softening processes. The reduced accumulation of proteins involved in ethylene biosynthesis juxtaposed to the upregulation of a transposase and a GTP-binding protein in the high firmness phenotype. The results also showed higher expression of cytoskeleton proteins in the high firmness phenotype compared to the low firmness phenotype, which play a role in maintaining cell structure and possibly fruit integrity.

The carotenoid pathway is controlled by flux of metabolites, rate-limiting enzyme steps, feed-back inhibition, and the strength of sink organelles, the plastids, in the cell. In apple (Malus × domestica Borkh), fruit carotenoid concentrations are low in comparison with those in other fruit species. The apple fruit flesh, in particular, begins development with high amounts of chlorophylls and carotenoids, but in all commercial cultivars a large proportion of this is lost by fruit maturity. To understand the control of carotenoid concentrations in apple fruit, metabolic and gene expression analysis of the carotenoid pathway were measured in genotypes with varying flesh and skin colour. Considerable variation in both carotenoid concentrations and compound profile was observed between tissues and genotypes, with carotenes and xanthophylls being found only in fruit accumulating high carotenoid concentrations.

The three herbicides were successfully separated and independently confirmed in a single run. Different extraction and cleanup methods were used to optimize the pretreatment processes of the residue analysis method. The final method is straightforward and involves extraction with 1% formic acid-acetonitrile, and no complicated cleanup process is needed. Determination of the compounds was achieved within 3.0 min. Respective average recoveries using this method at four concentration levels (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) ranged from 66.5 to 109.4%, with RSDs in the range of 1.1-19.7% (n = 5) for all analytes.

22628198,"The freezing pattern and frost killing temperatures of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) xylem were determined by differential thermal analysis and infrared differential thermal analysis (IDTA). Results from detached or attached twigs in controlled freezing experiments and during natural field freezing of trees were compared. Non-lethal freezing of apoplastic water in apple xylem as monitored during natural winter frosts in the field occurred at -1.9 ± 0.4 °C and did not change seasonally. The pattern of whole tree freezing was variable and specific to the environmental conditions. On detached twigs high-temperature freezing exotherms (HTEs) occurred 2.8 K below the temperature observed under natural frosts in the field with a seasonal mean of -4.7 ± 0.5 °C. Microporous apple xylem showed freezing without a specific pattern within a few seconds in IDTA images during HTEs, which is in contrast to macroporous xylem where a 2D freezing pattern mirrors anatomical structures. The pith tissue always remained unfrozen. Increasing twig length increased ice nucleation temperature; for increased twig diameter the effect was not significant. In attached twigs frozen in field portable freezing chambers, HTEs were recorded at a similar mean temperature (-4.6 ± 1.0 °C) to those for detached twigs. Upon lethal intracellular freezing of apple xylem parenchyma cells (XPCs) low-temperature freezing exotherms (LTEs) can be recorded. Low-temperature freezing exotherms determined on detached twigs varied significantly between a winter minimum of -36.9 °C and a summer maximum -12.7 °C. Within the temperature range wherein LTEs were recorded by IDTA in summer (-12.7 ± 0.5 to -20.3 ± 1.1 °C) various tiny clearly separated discontinuous freezing events could be detected similar to that in other species with contrasting XPC anatomy. These freezing events appeared to be initially located in the primary and only later in the secondary xylem. During the LTE no freezing events in the bark and central pith tissue were recorded. Attached twigs were exposed to various freezing temperatures at which LTEs occur. Even if 60% of XPCs were frost-damaged twigs were able to recuperate and showed full re-growth indicating a high regeneration capacity even after severe frost damage to XPCs.",Tree physiology,"['D004055', 'D004780', 'D005615', 'D007053', 'D027845', 'D058503', 'D019368', 'D012621', 'D013055', 'D014934', 'D052584']","['Differential Thermal Analysis', 'Environment, Controlled', 'Freezing', 'Ice', 'Malus', 'Mesophyll Cells', 'Nature', 'Seasons', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Wood', 'Xylem']",Freezing pattern and frost killing temperature of apple (Malus domestica) wood under controlled conditions and in nature.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000254', 'Q000166', None, None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000166']","[None, None, None, None, 'growth & development', 'cytology', None, None, None, 'physiology', 'cytology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22628198,2013

22608778,"In this work, the capability of gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) for quantitative analysis of pesticide residues has been evaluated. A multiclass method for rapid screening of pesticides (insecticides, acaricides, herbicides and fungicides) in fruit and vegetable matrices has been developed and validated, including detection, identification and quantification of the analytes. To this aim, several food matrices were selected: high water content (apples, tomatoes and carrots), high acid content (oranges) and high oil content (olives) samples. The well known QuEChERS procedure was applied for extraction of pesticides, and matrix-matched calibration using relative responses versus internal standard was used for quantification. The sample extracts were analyzed by GC-TOF MS. Up to five ions using narrow window (0.02 Da)-extracted ion chromatograms at the expected retention time were monitored using a target processing method. The most abundant ion was used for quantification while the remaining ones were used for confirmation of the analyte identity. Method validation was carried out for 55 analytes in the five sample matrices tested at three concentrations (0.01, 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg). Most recoveries were between 70% and 120% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20% at 0.05 and 0.5mg/kg. At 0.01 mg/kg, roughly half of the pesticides could be satisfactorily validated due to sensitivity limitations of GC-TOF MS, which probably affected the ion ratios used for confirmation of identity. In the case of olive samples, results were not satisfactory due to the high complexity of the matrix. An advantage of TOF MS is the possibility to perform a non-target investigation in the samples by application of a deconvolution software, without any additional injection being required. Accurate-mass full-spectrum acquisition in TOF MS provides useful information for analytes identification, and has made feasible in this work the discovery of non-target imazalil, fluoranthene and pyrene in some of the samples analyzed.",Journal of chromatography.

22504369,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are the most potent toxins known. Produced by Clostridium botulinum, BoNTs are classified into seven, antigenically distinct serotypes, designated A-G. The toxin acts to inhibit acetylcholine release, resulting in paralysis and death. Naturally occurring foodborne disease is most often the result of improper canning of foods, while wound botulism, associated with injection drug users, is on the rise. Because of its potency, BoNTs have also been identified as targets for use by bioterrorists. The 'gold standard' of detection of BoNTs is the mouse bioassay, an expensive and time consuming test that requires specialized equipment and trained personnel. There is a need for a rapid, sensitive diagnostic for BoNTs that could be used by minimally trained personnel in the event of a foodborne outbreak or a bioterrorist threat. Here, we describe the use of a single lateral flow device (LFD) that can detect and distinguish between BoNT/A and B, two of the four serotypes that are known to intoxicate humans and together represent >80% of naturally occurring illness. The device could detect as little as 5 ng/mL of purified BoNT/A and 10 ng/mL of BoNT/B in 2% and 1% milk, respectively. In undiluted apple juice, 25 ng/mL of BoNT/A and 10 ng/mL of BoNT/B could be detected. No cross reactivity between BoNT/A and B antibodies was observed. The LFD described here is easy to use, requires no specialized training or equipment, and can identify and distinguish between BoNT/A and /B serotypes.

At present, however, limited data are currently available on urinary OP metabolite levels worldwide. The purpose of this study was to assess urinary dialkylphosphate (DAP) concentrations in Japanese workers. Urine samples were collected in both summer and winter from 339 Japanese adults who worked as food distributors (FDs, n=164), apple farmers (AFs, n=147) and pest control operators (PCOs, n=28). DAPs were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after derivatization with pentafluorobenzylbromide. Dimethylphosphate (DMP), diethylphosphate (DEP), dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP) and diethylthiophosphate (DETP) were detected in the urine of over 87% of the studied populations in both seasons. The geometric mean values of total DAPs (nmol g(-1) creatinine), DMP, DMTP, DEP and DETP (μg g(-1) creatinine) in summer and winter were 106.7 and 98.3, 7.0 and 3.8, 3.4 and 4.5, 0.8 and 1.5, and 0.3 and 0.2 for the FDs, 440.8 and 197.7, 33.1 and 10.8, 10.1 and 5.8, 4.2 and 4.7 and 1.6 and 0.8 for the AFs, and 473.4 and 284.6, 28.9 and 22.2, 17.6 and 4.6, 3.5 and 4.4, and 0.5 and 0.6 for the PCOs, respectively, thereby revealing significantly higher concentrations in AFs and PCOs groups than in the FDs in both seasons except for winter DMTP.

22399441,"The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, infests apple (Malus domestica) and hawthorn species (most notably the downy hawthorn, Crataegus mollis) in the eastern USA. Evidence suggests that the fly was introduced into the western USA sometime in the last 60 years. In addition to apple, R. pomonella also infests two species of hawthorns in the western USA as major hosts: the native black hawthorn (C. douglasii) and the introduced ornamental English hawthorn, C. monogyna. Apple and downy hawthorn-origin flies in the eastern USA use volatile blends emitted from the surface of their respective ripening fruit to find and discriminate among host trees. To test whether the same is true for western flies, we used coupled gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and developed a 7-component apple fruit blend for western apple-origin flies, an 8-component black hawthorn fruit blend for flies infesting C. douglasii, and a 9-component ornamental hawthorn blend for flies from C. monogyna. Crataegus douglasii and C. monogyna-origin flies showed similar levels of upwind directed flight to their respective natal synthetic fruit blends in flight tunnel assays compared to whole fruit adsorbent extracts, indicating that the blends contain all the behaviorally relevant fruit volatiles to induce maximal response levels. The black and ornamental hawthorn blends shared four compounds in common including 3-methylbutan-1-ol, which appears to be a key volatile for R. pomonella populations in the eastern, southern, and western USA that show a preference for fruit from different Crataegus species. However, the blends also differed from one another and from domesticated apple in several respects that make it possible that western R. pomonella flies behaviorally discriminate among fruit volatiles and form ecologically differentiated host races, as is the case for eastern apple and hawthorn flies.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000818', 'D027825', 'D004175', 'D005426', 'D005638', 'D006790', 'D027845', 'D014481', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Crataegus', 'Diptera', 'Flight, Animal', 'Fruit', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Malus', 'United States', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']","Identification of host fruit volatiles from domestic apple (Malus domestica), native black hawthorn (Crataegus douglasii) and introduced ornamental hawthorn (C. monogyna) attractive to Rhagoletis pomonella flies from the western United States.","[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', 'physiology', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22399441,2012

The application of PGRs produced shifts of uronic acid and neutral sugars between fractions. Arabinose was the neutral sugar exhibiting more variations in apple callus cell wall. Picloram and abscisic acid produced an increase of the uronic acid contents of the cell walls. The AIRs obtained from calluses treated with different PGRs did not show large amounts of high molecular weight products, as determined by size-exclusion chromatography. For the carbonate-extract only the callus treated with picloram displayed two separated peaks for products of different molecular weights. The chromatographic profiles for the 4% KOH-extract displayed two peaks for all the treatments, one very sharp with high molecular weight, and another one wider of smaller molecular weight, whereas the difference between treatments can only be appraised through the areas of the peaks. This is the first report on cell wall composition from fruit calluses supplemented with different PGRs.",Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,"['D000040', 'D001089', 'D018929', 'D002473', 'D005638', 'D005875', 'D027845', 'D009005', 'D010368', 'D010846', 'D010937', 'D011134', 'D014574']","['Abscisic Acid', 'Arabinose', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Wall', 'Fruit', 'Gibberellins', 'Malus', 'Monosaccharides', 'Pectins', 'Picloram', 'Plant Growth Regulators', 'Polysaccharides', 'Uronic Acids']",Compositional changes in cell wall polysaccharides from apple fruit callus cultures modulated by different plant growth regulators.,"['Q000494', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000378', 'Q000032']","['pharmacology', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22325878,2013
22324905,"Supported liquid membrane (SLM) extraction was optimised for trace extraction and enrichment of selected triazine herbicides from a variety of agro-processed fruit juices and Ethiopian honey wine (Tej) samples. In the extraction process, a 1:1 mixture of n-undecane and di-n-hexylether was immobilised in a thin porous PTFE membrane that forms a barrier between two aqueous phases (the donor and acceptor phases) in a flow system. The extracts constitute the selectively enriched analytes collected from the acceptor phase and were analysed by transferring to a HPLC-UV system using a diode array detector at 235 nm. High enrichment factors were obtained with very good repeatability of results, and the detection limit was lower than 3.00 µg l⁻¹ for ametryn in apple juice. The optimised method showed very good linearity of over 50-500 µg l⁻¹ with a correlation coefficient of >0.990 or better for triplicate analysis. All chromatograms gave well resolved peaks with no interfering peaks at the retention times of the selected triazines, showing high selectivity of the SLM extraction method in combination with HPLC-UV for the selected matrices. The optimised method can be used as an alternative solventless extraction method for microgram-level extraction of other triazine herbicides and a variety of pesticides from liquid and semi-liquid environmental, biological and food matrices.","Food additives & contaminants.

However, the separation of cDNA-AFLP fragments by gel electrophoresis is reported to be labor-intensive with only limited potential for automation, and the collection of differential bands for gene identification is even more cumbersome. In this work, we present the use of dHPLC (denaturing high performance liquid chromatography) and automated DNA fragment collection using the WAVE(®) System to analyze and recover cDNA-AFLP fragments. The method is successfully applied to the Malus-Venturia inaequalis interaction, making it possible to collect 66 different transcript-derived fragments for apple genes putatively involved in the defense response activated by the HcrVf2 resistance gene. The results, validated by real time quantitative RT-PCR, were consistent with the plant-pathogen interaction under investigation and this further supports the suitability of dHPLC for cDNA-AFLP transcript profiling.

22124992,"Procyanidins (i.e. condensed tannins) are polyphenols commonly found in fruits. During juice and cider making, apple polyphenol oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) into its corresponding o-quinone which further reacts with procyanidins and other polyphenols, leading to the formation of numerous oxidation products. However, the structure and the reaction pathways of these neoformed phenolic compounds are still largely unknown. Experiments were carried out on a model system to gain insights into the chemical processes occurring during the initial steps of fruit processing. Procyanidin B2 was oxidized by caffeoylquinic acid o-quinone (CQAoq) in an apple juice model solution. The reaction products were monitored using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to ultraviolet (UV)-visible and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in the negative mode. Oxidative conversion of procyanidin B2 ([M-H](-) at m/z 577) into procyanidin A2 at m/z 575 was unambiguously confirmed. In addition, several classes of products were characterized by their deprotonated molecules ([M-H](-)) and their MS/MS fragmentation patterns: hetero-dimers (m/z 929) and homo-dimers (m/z 1153 and 705) resulting from dimerization involving procyanidin and CQA molecules; intramolecular addition products at m/z 575, 573, 927, 1151 and 703. Interestingly, no extensive polymerization was observed. Analysis of a cider apple juice enabled comparison with the results obtained on a biosynthetic model solution. However, procyanidin A2 did not accumulate but seemed to be an intermediate in the formation of an end-product at m/z 573 for which two structural hypotheses are given.

22121202,"Mass spectrometry-based imaging techniques applied to small molecules complement the growing research field of metabolomics and can be used to interpret many important biological processes occurring in plants. In untargeted imaging applications, chemical identification is a critical step since it cannot take advantage of separative techniques applied to neutral molecules (e.g. liquid chromatography). The use of high resolution spectrometers is of great help, but fragmentation experiments are often necessary. In many cases, the information on ion fragmentation is embedded in the data sets, because analytes break up during ionization, but the extraction of this information is not easy considering the complexity of the imaging data files. Here an approach is proposed for applying conventional untargeted MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization) profiling and advanced data analysis to perform imaging of metabolites in apple tissues. The pipeline, based on intensity correlation analysis, is used to extract fragmentation information from untargeted, high resolution, wide range mass spectra and to reconstruct compound-specific images which can be used for interpretation purposes.

A novel ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP), balsamin was purified from the seeds of Balsam apple, Momordica balsamina. Balsamin was purified by ion exchange chromatography on CM Sepharose and gel filtration on superdex-75. It has a molecular weight of 28 kDa as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis. Balsamin inhibits protein synthesis in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based cell free translation assay with an IC(50) of 90.6 ng ml(-1). It has RNA N-glycosidase activity and releases a 400-base long fragment termed the Endo fragment from 28S rRNA in the same manner as does saporin-6 from Saponaria officinalis. The N-terminal sequence analysis of the first 12 amino acids of balsamin revealed that it shares 83% similarity with type I RIP α-MMC from Momordica charantia and 50% similarity with β-MMC (from Momordica charantia), bryodin I (from Bryonia dioica) and luffin a (from Luffa cylindrica). Balsamin was further characterized by mass spectrometry.

And agar is the most frequently used gelling agent in plant tissue culture media. Galactomannans, another group of gel-forming polysaccharides, consists of a (1 → 4)-linked β-D: -mannopyranosyl backbone partially substituted at O-6 with D: -galactopyranosyl side groups. In this work, we demonstrate that a statistically significant 2.7-fold increase on the multiplication rate (MR) for in vitro-grown Marubakaido (Malus prunifolia) shoots was associated with a 12.5% replacement of agar in the semi-solid culture media for a galactomannan obtained from seeds of Schizolobium paraybae. This increase on MR was due mainly to a 1.9-fold increase in the number of main branches and an 8.6-fold increase in the number of primary lateral branches.

To understand the complex biological processes occurring in the hypanthium, a proteomics approach was used to analyze the proteome from freshly harvested ripe apple fruits. A total of 290 well-resolved spots were detected using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Out of these, 216 proteins were identified representing 116 non-redundant proteins using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and either the MASCOT or ProteinProspector engine for peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) database searching. Identified proteins were classified into 13 major functional categories. Among these, the energy metabolism class was the most represented and included 50% of proteins homologous to Arabidopsis proteins that are involved in the response to biotic and abiotic stresses, suggesting a dual role for these proteins in addition to energy metabolism. We also identified dynein heavy chain in the hypanthium although this protein has been proposed as absent from angiosperms and thus suggest that the lack of dyneins in higher plants studied to date may not be a general characteristic to angiosperm genomic organisation.

21928828,"The infection of stored apples by the fungus  Penicillium expansum  causes the contamination of fruits and fruit-derived products with the mycotoxin patulin, which is a major issue in food safety. Fungal attack can be prevented by beneficial microorganisms, so-called biocontrol agents. Previous time-course thin layer chromatography analyses showed that the aerobic incubation of patulin with the biocontrol yeast  Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae  strain LS11 leads to the disappearance of the mycotoxin spot and the parallel emergence of two new spots, one of which disappears over time. In this work, we analyzed the biodegradation of patulin effected by LS11 through HPLC. The more stable of the two compounds was purified and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance as desoxypatulinic acid, whose formation was also quantitated in patulin degradation experiments. After  R. kratochvilovae  LS11 had been incubated in the presence of (13)C-labeled patulin, label was traced to desoxypatulinic acid, thus proving that this compound derives from the metabolization of patulin by the yeast. Desoxypatulinic acid was much less toxic than patulin to human lymphocytes and, in contrast to patulin, did not react in vitro with the thiol-bearing tripeptide glutathione. The lower toxicity of desoxypatulinic acid is proposed to be a consequence of the hydrolysis of the lactone ring and the loss of functional groups that react with thiol groups.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that these populations could serve as reservoirs for fruit odor discrimination behaviors facilitating sympatric host race formation and speciation, specifically the recent shift from downy hawthorn (Crataegus mollis) to domestic apple (Malus domestica) in the northern USA. Coupled gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and flight tunnel bioassays were used to identify the behaviorally active natal fruit volatile blends for three of the five major southern hawthorns: C. opaca (western mayhaw), C. aestivalis (eastern mayhaw), and C. rufula (a possible hybrid between C. opaca and C. aestivalis). A 6-component blend was developed for C. opaca (3-methylbutan-1-ol [44%], pentyl acetate [6%], butyl butanoate [6%], propyl hexanoate [6%], butyl hexanoate [26%], and hexyl butanoate [12%]); an 8-component blend for C. aestivalis (3-methylbutan-1-ol [2%], butyl acetate [47%], pentyl acetate [2%], butyl butanoate [12%], propyl hexanoate [1%], butyl hexanoate [25%], hexyl butanoate [9%], and pentyl hexanoate [2%]); and a 9-component blend for C. rufula (3-methylbutan-1-ol [1%], butyl acetate [57%], 3-methylbutyl acetate [3%], butyl butanoate [5%], propyl hexanoate [1%], hexyl propionate [1%], butyl hexanoate [23%], hexyl butanoate [6%], and pentyl hexanoate [3%]). Crataegus aestivalis and C. opaca-origin flies showed significantly higher levels of upwind directed flight to their natal blend in flight tunnel assays compared to the non-natal blend and previously developed apple, northern downy hawthorn, and flowering dogwood blends. Eastern and western mayhaw flies also were tested to the C. rufula blend, with eastern flies displaying higher levels of upwind flight compared with the western flies, likely due to the presence of butyl acetate in the C. aestivalis and C. rufula blends, an agonist compound for eastern mayhaw-origin flies, but a behavioral antagonist for western flies. The results discount the possibility that the apple fly was ""pre-assembled"" and originated via a recent introduction of southern mayhaw flies predisposed to accepting apple. Instead, the findings are consistent with the possibility of southern mayhaw-infesting fly host races. However, mayhaw fruits do emit several volatiles found in apple. It is, therefore, possible that the ability of the fly to evolve a preference for apple volatiles, although not the entire blend, stemmed, in part, from standing variation related to the presence of these compounds in southern mayhaw fruit.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000818', 'D027825', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D006790', 'D027845', 'D012903', 'D033621', 'D014481', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Crataegus', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Malus', 'Smell', 'Tephritidae', 'United States', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Identification of host fruit volatiles from three mayhaw species (Crataegus series Aestivales) attractive to mayhaw-origin Rhagoletis pomonella flies in the southern United States.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'methods', None, 'metabolism', None, 'physiology', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21892724,2012

Two such ionization methods, low temperature plasma (LTP) and paper spray (PS), were employed in experiments performed at a local grocery store. LTP was used to detect diphenylamine (DPA) directly from the skin of apples in the store and those treated after harvest with DPA were recognized by MS and MS/MS. These data therefore allowed ready distinction between organic and non-organic apples. DPA was also found within the internal tissue of purchased apples and its distribution was mapped using LTP. Similarly, thiabendazole residues were detected on the skin of treated oranges in a grocery store experiment in which paper spray was performed by wiping the orange surface with a moist commercial lens wipe and then applying a high voltage to ionize the chemicals directly from the wipe. The handheld mass spectrometer used in these measurements is capable of performing several stages of tandem mass spectrometry (up to MS(5)); the compounds on the fruit were identified by their MS/MS fragmentation patterns. Protonated DPA (m/z 170) produced a characteristic MS(2) fragment ion at m/z 92, while thiabendazole was identified by MS(3) using precursor to fragment ion transitions m/z 202 →m/z 175 →m/z 131.

More specifically, we describe the first example of a caffeic acid (CA) MIP which has been synthesised in the form of well-defined polymer microspheres, and its use for the extraction of CA from fruit juice sample. The CA MIP was synthesised by precipitation polymerisation using 4-vinylpyridine as functional monomer, divinylbenzene-80 as crosslinker and acetonitrile:toluene (75/25, v/v) as porogen. The particle sizing and morphological characterisation of the polymers was carried out by means of scanning electron microscopy (narrow particle size distribution; ∼5 and 1.5 μm particle diameters for the MIP and NIP [non-imprinted polymer], respectively) and nitrogen sorption porosimetry (specific surface areas of 340 and 350 m(2)g(-1), and specific pore volumes of 0.17 and 0.19 cm(3)g(-1) for the MIP and NIP, respectively). The polymers were evaluated further by batch rebinding experiments, and from the derived isotherms their binding capacity and binding strength were determined (number of binding sites (N(K))=0.6 and 0.3 mmol g(-1) for the MIP and NIP, respectively, and apparent average adsorption constant (K(N))=10.0 and 1.6L mmol(-1) for the MIP and NIP, respectively). To evaluate the molecular recognition character of the MIP it was packed into a stainless steel column (50 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.) and evaluated as an HPLC-stationary phase. The mobile phase composition, flow rate, and the elution profile were then optimised in order to improve the peak shape without negatively affecting the imprinting factor (IF). Very interesting, promising properties were revealed. The imprinting factor (IF) under the optimised conditions was 11.9. Finally, when the imprinted LC column was used for the selective recognition of CA over eight related compounds, very good selectivity was obtained. This outcome enabled the direct extraction of CA in commercial apple juice samples with recoveries in excess of 81% and, rather significantly, without any need for a clean-up step prior to the extraction.",Journal of chromatography.

21887525,"The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, infests several hawthorn species in the southern USA. In a companion paper, we showed that R. pomonella flies infesting two different mayhaw species (Crataegus opaca and C. aestivalis) can discriminate between volatile blends developed for each host fruit, and that these blends are different from previously constructed blends for northern fly populations that infest domestic apple (Malus domestica), downy hawthorn (Crataegus mollis), and flowering dogwood (Cornus florida). Here, we show by using coupled gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and flight tunnel bioassays, that two additional southern hawthorn fly populations infesting C. viridis (green hawthorn) and C. brachyacantha (blueberry hawthorn) also can discriminate between volatile blends for each host fruit type. A 9-component blend was developed for C. viridis (3-methylbutan-1-ol [5%], butyl butanoate [19.5%], propyl hexanoate [1.5%], butyl hexanoate [24%], hexyl butanoate [24%], pentyl hexanoate [2.5%], 1-octen-3-ol [0.5%], pentyl butanoate [2.5%], and (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) [20.5%]) and an 8-component blend for C. brachyacantha (3-methylbutan-1-ol [0.6%], butyl acetate [50%], pentyl acetate [3.5%], butyl butanoate [9%], butyl hexanoate [16.8%], hexyl butanoate [16.8%], 1-octen-3-ol [0.3%], and pentyl butanoate [3%]). Crataegus viridis and C. brachyacantha-origin flies showed significantly higher levels of upwind oriented flight to their natal blend in flight tunnel assays compared to the alternate, non-natal blend and previously developed northern host plant blends. The presence of DMNT in C. viridis and butyl acetate in C. brachyacantha appeared to be largely responsible for driving the differential response. This sharp behavioral distinction underscores the diversity of odor response phenotypes in the southern USA, points to possible host race formation in these populations, and despite the presence of several apple volatiles in both blends, argues against a functional apple race existing on southern host plants prior to the introduction of apple to North America.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000818', 'D002849', 'D027825', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D006790', 'D009812', 'D010641', 'D013045', 'D033621', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Crataegus', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Odorants', 'Phenotype', 'Species Specificity', 'Tephritidae', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Identification of fruit volatiles from green hawthorn (Crataegus viridis) and blueberry hawthorn (Crataegus brachyacantha) host plants attractive to different phenotypes of Rhagoletis pomonella flies in the southern United States.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'physiology', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21887525,2012

After the introduction of amino groups onto the silica surface with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, azo initiator onto the silica surface was achieved by the reaction of surface amino groups with 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid). The scale-up synthesis of MIP was then carried out in the presence of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid as template substitute, functional, and cross-linking monomers. The prepared sorbent was characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, elemental analysis, and the adsorption-desorption selectivity, and the capacity characteristic of the polymer was investigated by a conventional batch adsorption test and Scatchard plot analysis. The results indicated that coated polymers had specific adsorption to PTL as compared with its co-occurring 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)), at the same bulk concentration for solution of PTL and HMF, the maximum absorbance in the solid-phase extraction (SPE) method to PTL were 93.97% or 0.654 μg/mg while to HMF they were 76.89% or 0.496 μg/mg.

21819870,"A rapid and effective method for enantioselective determination of simeconazole enantiomers in food products (cucumber, tomato, apple, pear, wheat and rice) has been developed. The enantiomers were resolved by capillary gas chromatography (GC) using a commercial chiral column (BGB-172) and a temperature program from 150°C (held for 1 min) and then raised at 10°C min(-1) to 240°C (held for 10 min). This enantioselective gas chromatographic separation was combined with a clean-up/enrichment procedure based on the modification of QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method. Co-extractives were removed with graphitized carbon black/primary secondary amine (GCB/PSA) solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges using acetonitrile:toluene (3:1, v/v) as eluent. Gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-ITMS) with electron ionization (EI) was then used for qualitative and quantitative determination of the simeconazole enantiomers. Two precursor-to-product ion transitions (m/z 121-101 and 195-153) with the best signal intensity were chosen to build the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) acquisition method. The limits of detection for each enantiomer of simeconazole in six food products ranged between 0.4 and 0.9 μg kg(-1), which were much lower than maximum residue levels (MRLs) established by Japan. The methodology was successfully applied for the enantioselective analysis of simeconazole enantiomers in real samples, indicating its efficacy in investigating the environmental stereochemistry of simeconazole in food matrix.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D000935', 'D002849', 'D002523', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D057230', 'D010573', 'D011786', 'D012680', 'D052616', 'D053719', 'D014230', 'D014297', 'D014675']","['Antifungal Agents', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Limit of Detection', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Quality Control', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triazoles', 'Trimethylsilyl Compounds', 'Vegetables']","Enantioselective determination of triazole fungicide simeconazole in vegetables, fruits, and cereals using modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) coupled to gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.","['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21819870,2011

As a completely new approach, highly automated planar chromatographic tools were applied for powerful clean-up, called high-throughput planar solid phase extraction (HTpSPE). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was used to completely separate pesticides from matrix compounds and to focus them into a sharp zone, followed by extraction of the target zone by the TLC-MS interface. HTpSPE resulted in extracts nearly free of interference and free of matrix effects, as shown for seven chemically representative pesticides in four different matrices (apples, cucumbers, red grapes, tomatoes). Regarding the clean-up step, quantification by LC-MS provided mean recovery (against solvent standards) of 90-104% with relative standard deviations of 0.3-4.1% (n=5) for two spiking levels of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg.

Each of the targeted pesticides was readily detected with both high-resolution and full-scan collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra. In the case of simazine and sevin, a mass resolution of 100,000 was insufficient to distinguish the isobaric protonated molecules for these compounds. When the surface of a spinach leaf was analyzed by LESA, trace levels of diazinon were readily detected on the spinach purchased directly from a supermarket before they were sprayed with the five-pesticide mixture. A 30 s rinse under hot running tap water appeared to quantitatively remove all remaining residues of this pesticide. Diazinon was readily detected by LESA analysis on the skin of the artificially sprayed spinach. Finally, incurred pyrimethanil at a level of 169 ppb in a batch slurry of homogenized apples was analyzed by LESA and this pesticide was readily detected by both high-resolution mass spectrometry and full-scan CID mass spectrometry, thus showing that pesticides may also be detected in whole fruit homogenized samples.

We have developed an efficient method to analyze the compound in a wide variety of food matrices. The analysis is conducted using headspace (HS) gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detector. Using a robot autosampler, the samples are digested in full automation with simulated gastric fluid (1 h at 37°C) under shaking, which frees acetaldehyde loosely bound to matrix compounds. Afterwards, an aliquot of the HS is injected into the GC system. Standard addition was applied for quantification to compensate for matrix effects. The precision of the method was sufficient (<3% coefficient of variation). The limit of detection was 0.01 mg/L and the limit of quantification was 0.04 mg/L. 140 authentic samples were analyzed. The acetaldehyde content in apples was 0.97 ± 0.80 mg/kg, orange juice contained 3.86 ± 2.88 mg/kg. The highest concentration was determined in a yoghurt (17 mg/kg).

21699174,"A liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of patulin in apple- and pear-based foodstuffs was developed. The sample preparation is based on the QuEChERS procedure involving an initial extraction step with water and acetonitrile, followed by a partitioning step after the addition of magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride. The cleanup was performed by using dispersive solid-phase extraction with a mixture of magnesium sulfate, primary secondary amine sorbent, and n-octadecylsiloxane sorbent added together to the extract. The cleaned extract was finally evaporated and reconstituted in water prior to injection. Quantitation was performed by isotope dilution using ((13)C(7))-patulin as internal standard. The method was first fully validated in three different baby food products including apple-pear juice, apple-pear puree, and infant cereals. Then the scope of application of the method was extended to pear concentrate, raw apples, apple flakes (naturally contaminated), dried apples, and yogurt. The sensitivity achieved by the method in all matrices gave limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) of ≤0.5 and ≤10 μg/kg, respectively, which was compliant with maximum levels settled in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006.

Bacterial cell surface charge and hydrophobicity of untreated and PEF-treated E. coli O157:H7 were determined immediately and after storage at 5°C and 23°C using hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction chromatography. Similarly, the populations surviving the PEF treatments including injured cells were determined by plating 0.1 mL of the sample on sorbitol MacConkey agar and tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates. The surviving populations of E. coli cells after PEF treatment varied depending on field strength and treatment temperature used. Percent injury in the surviving populations was high immediately after PEF treatment and varied among treatment temperatures. Cell surface charge of E. coli bacteria before PEF treatment averaged 32.10±8.12. PEF treatments at 25°C, 35°C, and 45°C reduced the above surface charge to 26.34±1.24, 14.24±3.30, and 6.72±2.82, respectively.

21535724,"In recent years, the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables has greatly increased, and so has its association with contamination of several foodborne pathogens (Listeria, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli). Hence, there is a need to investigate effective sanitizer systems for produce decontamination. Chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)), a strong oxidizing gas with broad spectrum and sanitizing properties, has previously been studied for use on selected fruits and vegetables. ClO(2) gas treatments show great potential for surface pathogen reduction; however its use from a residue safety standpoint has yet to be assessed. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate residues of ClO(2), chlorite, chlorate, and chloride on selected fresh produce surfaces after treatment with ClO(2) gas. A rinse procedure was used and water samples were analyzed by N, N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine and ion chromatography method (300.0). Seven different foods--tomatoes, oranges, apples, strawberries, lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, and cantaloupe--were analyzed after ClO(2) treatment for surface residues.

After a month of cold storage, apples of cultivars ""Jonagold"" and ""Golden Delicious"" were exposed to ambient temperatures for 21 d, with subsequent sampling every 3 or 4 d. Fruit firmness, changes in amounts of sugars, malic acid, and phenolics were observed during shelf life. Chemical analyses were done with HPLC-PDA system. An interchange between various sugars was noticed, but in general, the sum of sugars remained at the same level. The content of malic acid remained stable or dropped, resulting in sweeter fruit. Levels of phenolics were more constant in the pulp of both cultivars analyzed, while in the peel, the changes were more pronounced. In the pulp, a peak in the content of hydroxycinnamic acids and flavanols was noticed on the 2nd or 3rd sampling and afterwards, the amounts remained constant. In the peel an initial decrease of all analyzed phenolic groups was observed in both cultivars, however it was more pronounced in ""Jonagold.""

21477805,"Pyraclostrobin belongs to a new generation of fungicides widely used to preserve high valuable crops. In the present study, three monoclonal antibodies with different affinities to this modern strobilurin have been evaluated for their usefulness in the production of immunoaffinity columns suitable for the solid-phase extraction, concentration, and clean-up of residues from food commodities. Different immunosorbents were produced and characterized in terms of antibody immobilization efficiency, immunosorbent binding capacity, optimum elution conditions, and reusability. Covalent coupling of the antibodies to Sepharose-CNBr gel took place with high yield (over 90%), whereas the immunosorbent efficacy to retain the analyte (from 28 to 68%) was shown to depend on the amount and type of antibody immobilized on the support. As a matter of fact, columns prepared with the monoclonal antibody PYs5#14 were able to selectively bound up to 53 μg of pyraclostrobin per gram of beads. Acetonitrile solutions were preferred over methanolic ones for analyte elution, and some immunosorbents could be reused at least 4-6 times provided that the amount of pyraclostrobin and the volume of sample did not overload the column. Effectiveness of the selected immunoaffinity column was evidenced by the development of an extraction procedure for pyraclostrobin residues from fruit juices and further determination by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. A concentration factor of 50 times was achieved with the developed immunoaffinity column, which eventually resulted in a limit of quantification of 0.01 mg L(-1).

21388817,"This paper describes the development of methods for the rapid screening of gross alpha (GA) and gross beta (GB) radioactivity in liquid foods, specifically, Tang drink mix, apple juice, and milk, as well as screening of GA, GB, and gamma radioactivity from surface deposition on apples. Detailed procedures were developed for spiking of matrices with (241)Am (alpha radioactivity), (90)Sr/(90)Y (beta radioactivity), and (60)Co, (137)Cs, and (241)Am (gamma radioactivity). Matrix stability studies were performed for 43 days after spiking. The method for liquid foods is based upon rapid digestion, evaporation, and flaming, followed by gas proportional (GP) counting. For the apple matrix, surface radioactivity was acid-leached, followed by GP counting and/or gamma spectrometry. The average leaching recoveries from four different apple brands were between 63% and 96%, and have been interpreted on the basis of ion transport through the apple cuticle. The minimum detectable concentrations (MDCs) were calculated from either the background or method-blank (MB) measurements. They were found to satisfy the required U.S. FDA's Derived Intervention Levels (DILs) in all but one case. The newly developed methods can perform radioactivity screening in foods within a few hours and have the potential to capacity with further automation. They are especially applicable to emergency response following accidental or intentional contamination of food with radioactivity.","Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine","['D000512', 'D053000', 'D001628', 'D002138', 'D002588', 'D003037', 'D004063', 'D004630', 'D005507', 'D005720', 'D027845', 'D011851', 'D011868', 'D013051', 'D013326', 'D015021']","['Alpha Particles', 'Analytic Sample Preparation Methods', 'Beverages', 'Calibration', 'Cesium Radioisotopes', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Digestion', 'Emergencies', 'Food Contamination, Radioactive', 'Gamma Rays', 'Malus', 'Radioactivity', 'Radioisotopes', 'Spectrometry, Gamma', 'Strontium Radioisotopes', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes']",Rapid screening of radioactivity in food for emergency response.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21388817,2011

Micelle templated silicas with a specific pore size were synthetically modified to possess propylthiol groups, a functional group known to form Michael reaction products with the conjugated double bond system of patulin. BET surface area analysis indicated the propylthiol functionalized SBA-15 possesses channels with the pore size of 5.4 nm and a surface area of 345 m(2)g(-1). Elemental analysis indicates the silicon/sulfur ratio to be 10:1, inferring one propylthiol substituent for every ten silica residues. The propylthiol modified SBA-15 was effective at significantly reducing high levels of patulin from aqueous solutions (pH 7.0) in batch sorption assays at room temperature. The material was less effective at lower pH; however heating low pH solutions and apple juice to 60 °C in the presence of propylthiol functionalized SBA-15 significantly reduced the levels of patulin in contaminated samples. Composite molecular models developed by semi-empirical PM3 and empirical force field methods support patulin permeation through the mesoporous channels of propylthiol functionalized SBA-15. Density functional study at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level predicts the proposed patulin adducts formed by reaction with the thiol residues exhibit less electrophilic properties than patulin.

The preparation of the samples was very simple: an aliquot of the juice was centrifuged and it was ten-times diluted prior to analysis, which allowed reducing considerably the time and cost of the analyses. Besides, dilution of the samples permits reducing the amount of matrix going into the system, and thus, decreasing the matrix effects, so common in this type of commodities, opening the possibility to perform quantification with solvent based standards. Validation of the method was carried out in accordance with EU guidelines. Calibration curves covering three orders of magnitude were performed, and they were linear over the concentration range studied for all the matrices (from 0.1 to 100 μg L(-1)). Practical limits of quantification were in the low μg L(-1) range, far below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) of the EU regulations, which do not set specific MRLs for juices, and in this cases of processed food, MRLs of the raw product are applied. Repeatability of the instrumental method was studied in all matrices, obtaining good intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs).

21193007,"This work aimed at isolation and identification of patulin producing fungi and to follow the presence of patulin during apple juice processing. Among 34 Penicillium isolates, eight isolates (five from healthy appeared apples and 12 from rot spotted apples) were considered as patulin producers using thin-layer chromatography. These isolates were classically identified as a Penicillium expansum. PCR utilizing primers based on the polygalacturonase gene of P. expansum was applied for detecting this mold. The PCR amplified a 404-bp DNA product from all tested P. expansum isolates, but not in other common food spoilage Penicillium species. RAPD technique using P1 or M13 primers was applied to determine the similarity of the P. expansum isolates. RAPD results revealed that the tested strains showed high percentage of similarity and no correlation was observed between cluster analysis and the sources of isolation. Patulin could not be detected in healthy appeared apples and their extracted juice during different stages of juice process. In apple juice made from the healthy parts of apples decayed by P. expansum contained patulin which may present health hazard. The obtained results assured that patulin is known to be stable in apple juice even after pasteurization. In conclusion, the removal of the rotten part from the fruit is not sufficient to eliminate the mycotoxin patulin from apple juice.

30743679,"In northern Italy, blue mold can occur generally on apples after 3 months of storage under controlled atmospheres. The mold can be caused by Penicillium griseofulvum Dierckx (synonym P. urticae Bainier). During 2008, several postharvest fruit rots were observed on apples (cv. Golden Delicious) after 180 to 240 days of storage at 1°C. Approximately 8% of the fruits showed blue mold. Apples had been cultivated in Aosta (Aosta Valley Region) and Lagnasco (Piedmont Region). Infected fruits showed soft, watery, brown spots enlarging rapidly at 20°C. There was a distinct margin between soft rotted flesh and firm healthy tissues. Under high humidity, masses of blue-green spores formed on the surface of the lesion. Apple fruit excisions from the margin between the healthy and diseased tissues were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), pH 5.6. The recovered fungus produced abundant mycelium and conidia, with the colonies attaining a diameter of 2.0 to 2.4 cm after 7 days at 20 ± 2°C on PDA. Colonies were mostly yellow-green, with a yellowish-to-orange brown underside. Conidiophores were mononematous or loosely synnematous, hyaline, with branches strongly divergent. Phialides were cylindrical with a very short neck. Conidia were ellipsoidal, sometimes subglobose, 2.5 to 3.5 × 2.2 to 2.5 μm, hyaline to greenish. Preliminary morphological identification of the fungus (2) was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from mycelia of pure cultures. Two sequences, obtained through the amplification of ribosomal region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (1), were blast searched in GenBank and showed 99% sequence coverage and 99% similarity to ribosomal sequences of P. griseofulvum. Two sequences were deposited in GenBank with Accession Nos. HQ012498 (a strain from Aosta Valley) and HQ012499 (a strain from the Piedmont Region). Pathogenicity was tested on 20 ripe fruits each of four apple cultivars (Golden Delicious, Red Chief, Granny Smith, and Royal Gala). Fruits were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Conidial suspensions (30 μl of 105 conidia/ml) of the fungus were placed on artificial wounds generated on the apple surface. Control fruits were treated with sterile water.

Acetonitrile was used as the solvent to extract the two fungicides from apple pulp and peel, assisted by microwave irradiation. When the extraction process was finished, the target analytes in the extraction solvent were rapidly transferred from the acetonitrile extract to another extraction solvent (1-undecanol) by using DLLME-SFO. Because of the lower density of 1-undecanol than that of water, the finely dispersed droplets of 1-undecanol collected on the top of aqueous sample and solidified at low temperature. Meanwhile, the tiny particles of apple cooled and precipitated. Recovery was tested for a concentration of 8 μg kg⁻¹. Recovery of diethofencarb and pyrimethanil from apple pulp and peel was in the range 83.5-101.3%. The repeatability of the method, expressed as relative standard deviation, varied between 4.8 and 8.3% (n = 6).

The rather short length of the statistical segment is an effect of the different location of interflavanol linkages, which cause a loss of orientational correlation between successive monomers. Oxidation created new bonds that were resistant to thiolysis, and, according to thiolysis, some of these new bonds were intramolecular. However, according to SAXS, oxidation at high tannin concentration caused the weight average degree of polymerization to increase, indicating that intermolecular reactions took place as well, creating larger macromolecules. In the case of the smaller grape seed tannins, these intermolecular reactions took place ""end to end"" leading to the formation of longer linear macromolecules, at least in the earlier stages of oxidation. In the case of the larger apple tannins, the SAXS patterns were characteristic of larger branched macromolecules. Accordingly, the intermolecular reactions were mainly ""end to middle"".

The results indicated the regularity in spectral reflectance of apple fluorescence canopy to a certain degree under different conditions, especially in the 760-1 350 nm near-infrared bands. The authors found that canopy spectral reflectance declined along with the decrease in sunshine and it is appropriate to detect canopy spectrum in sunny days with few clouds. In addition, spectral reflectance tended to be stable when the wind scale was below grade 2. The discrepancy of canopy spectra is small during the time period from 10:00 to 15:00 of a day compared to that of other times. For maintaining stable spectral curves, the height of detector to apple canopy needed to be adjusted to cover the whole canopy within the field of view according to detection angle of the detector. The vertical or approximately vertical detection was the best for canopy spectral reflectance acquisition.

In this study, the production of patulin by Byssochlamys spp (Byssochlamys nivea FRR 4421, B. nivea ATCC 24008 and Byssochlamys fulva IOC 4518) in cloudy and clarified apple juices packaged in laminated paperboard packages or in polyethylene terephthalate bottles (PET) and stored at both 21 degrees C and 30 degrees C, was investigated. The three Byssochlamys strains were able to produce patulin in both cloudy and clarified apple juices. Overall, the lower the storage temperature, the lower the patulin levels and mycelium dry weight in the apple juices (p<0.05). The greatest variations in pH and degrees Brix were observed in the juices from which the greatest mycelium dry weights were recovered. The maximum levels of patulin recovered from the juices were ca. 150 microg/kg at 21 degrees C and 220 microg/kg at 30 degrees C.

The transmitted light is read by a fiber-optic charge coupled device (CCD) spectrometer. Alkaline cobinamide (orange, lambda(max) = 510 nm) changes to violet (lambda(max) = 583 nm) upon reaction with cyanide. Multiwavelength detection permits built-in correction for artifact responses intrinsic to a single-line flow injection system and corrects for drift. With optimum choice of the reaction medium, flow rate, and mixing coil length, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) is 30 nM and the linear dynamic range extends to 10 microM. The response base width for 1% carryover is <95 s, permitting a throughput of 38 samples/h. The relative standard deviations (rsd) for repetitive determinations at 0.15, 0.5, and 1 microM were 7.6% (n = 5), 3.2% (n = 7), and 1.7% (n = 6), respectively.

With this working method, not only the problems arising from instrumental artifacts are overcome, but also the detection of new analytes is achieved as well as better understanding of the studied dataset is obtained. As a positive consequence of using the proposed working method human time and work are saved. To exemplify this methodology the aroma profile of 36 apples being ripened were studied. The benefits of the proposed methodology (PARAFAC2+PCA) are shown in a practitioner perspective, being able to extrapolate the conclusions obtained here to other hyphenated chromatographic datasets.",Journal of chromatography.

Phenolics were extracted from fresh apples with methanol, and sugars were removed from the crude extract by treatment with Amberlite resin before fractionating the proanthocyanidins into ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate fraction was chromatographed on Toyopearl TSK HW-50F to yield about 50 mg of procyanidin dimer and 35 mg of trimer from 1 kg fresh apple fruit. The purity and identity of the standards was easily confirmed by using ESI-MS. In the acid butanol assay, the pure dimer, trimer and purified Sorghum procyanidin had similar color yields on a mass basis, and produced about three times more color than purified quebracho tannin. This new standard overcomes problems associated with overestimation of tannin due to use of the unreactive quebracho tannin standard.

Life-science inspired analytical approaches were successfully applied to study the reactions of BADGE with food ingredients, for example, amino acids and sugars. An improved mass balance of BADGE was achieved by selective detection of reaction products of BADGE with low molecular weight food components, using a successful combination of stable isotopes of BADGE and analysis by LC coupled to fluorescence detection (FLD) and high-resolution mass spectrometric (MS) detection.

20172528,"The gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) deconvolution reporting software (DRS) from Agilent Technologies has been evaluated for its ability as a screening tool to detect a large number of pesticides in incurred and fortified samples extracted with acetone/dichloromethane/light petroleum (Mini-Luke method). The detection of pesticides is based on fixed retention times using retention time locking (RTL) and full scan mass spectral comparison with a partly customer built automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system (AMDIS) database. The GC-MS was equipped with a programmable temperature vaporising (PTV) injector system which enables more sample to be injected. In a blind study of 52 real samples a total number of 158 incurred pesticides were found. In addition to the 85 pesticides found by manual interpretation of GC-NPD/ECD chromatograms, the DRS revealed 73 more pesticides (+46%). The DRS system also shows its potential to discover pesticides which are normally not searched for (EPN in long beans from Thailand). A spiking experiment was performed to blank matrices of apple, orange and lettuce with 177 different pesticides at concentration levels 0.02 and 0.1 mg/kg. The samples were analysed on GC-MS full scan and the AMDIS match factor was used as a mass spectral quality criterion. The threshold level of the AMDIS match factor was set at 20 to eliminate most of the false positives. AMDIS match factors from 20 up to 69 are regarded only as indication of a positive hit and must be followed by manual interpretation. Pesticides giving AMDIS match factors at > or = 70 are regarded as identified. To simplify and decrease the large amount of data generated at each concentration level, the AMDIS match factors > or = 20 was averaged (mean AMF) for each pesticide including the commodities and their replicates. Among 177 different pesticides spiked at 0.02 and 0.1 mg/kg level, the percentage of mean AMF values > or = 70 were 23% and 80%, respectively. For 531 individual detections of pesticides (177 pesticides x 3 replicates) giving AMDIS match factor 20 in apple, orange and lettuce, the detection rates at 0.02 mg/kg were 71%, 63% and 72%, respectively. For the 0.1 mg/kg level the detection rates were 89%, 85% and 89%, respectively. In real samples some manual interpretation must be performed in addition.

20144460,"This article describes the comparison of different versions of an easy, rapid and low-cost sample preparation approach for the determination of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables by concurrent use of gas and liquid chromatography (GC and LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) for detection. The sample preparation approach is known as QuEChERS, which stands for ""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe"". The three compared versions were based on the original unbuffered method, which was first published in 2003, and two interlaboratory validated versions: AOAC Official Method 2007.01, which uses acetate buffering, and European Committee for Standardization (CEN) Standard Method EN 15662, which calls for citrate buffering. LC-MS/MS and GC-MS analyses using each method were tested from 50 to 1000ng/g in apple-blueberry sauce, peas and limes spiked with 32 representative pesticides. As expected, the results were excellent (overall average of 98% recoveries with 10% RSD) using all 3 versions, except the unbuffered method gave somewhat lower recoveries for the few pH-dependent pesticides. The different methods worked equally well for all matrices tested with equivalent amounts of matrix co-extractives measured, matrix effects on quantification and chemical noise from matrix in the chromatographic backgrounds. The acetate-buffered version gave higher and more consistent recoveries for pymetrozine than the other versions in all 3 matrices and for thiabendazole in limes. None of the versions consistently worked well for chlorothalonil, folpet or tolylfluanid in peas, but the acetate-buffered method gave better results for screening of those pesticides. Also, due to the recent shortage in acetonitrile (MeCN), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) was evaluated as a substitute solvent in the acetate-buffered QuEChERS version, but it generally led to less clean extracts and lower recoveries of pymetrozine, thiabendazole, acephate, methamidophos, omethoate and dimethoate. In summary, the acetate-buffered version of QuEChERS using MeCN exhibited advantages compared to the other tested methods in the study.",Journal of chromatography.

Identification of the analytes was confirmed under selective ion monitoring mode by the presence of two dominant ion fragments within specific time windows and matching of relative ion intensities of the ions concerned in samples and calibration standards. Quantitation was based on the measurement of concentration ratios of the natural and isotope analogues in the sample and calibration blends. Intraday and interday repeatabilities of replicate analyses of the pyethroids in an apple juice sample were below 0.5%. The expanded relative uncertainty ranged from 3 to 6%, which was significantly lower than the range obtained using internal or external calibration methods. As a labeled analogue is not available for bifenthrin, bifenthrin was determined using labeled cis-permethrin as the internal standard.

According to a multi-enzyme microtiter-plate assay, rabbit liver esterase (RLE), Bacillus subtilis esterase (BS2), and cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi (CUT) were used for the detection of 21 organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides by high-performance thin-layer chromatography-enzyme inhibition assays (HPTLC-EI). Staining was performed with Fast Blue Salt B coupling to alpha-naphthol enzymatically released from the respective acetate used as substrate. Quantitative analysis was achieved by densitometric evaluation at 533 nm. Enzyme inhibition factors derived from HPTLC-EI were calculated from the slopes of the linear calibration curves, which allowed comparisons to published inhibition constants and well correlated to sensitivity parameters. Limits of detection ranged from a few pg/zone for organophosphates as strongest inhibitors to a few ng/zone for most carbamates, when RLE and BS2 were used. Without oxidation, chlorpyrifos and parathion were directly detectable at approximately 60 and 14 ng/zone, respectively. As the enzyme of lowest sensitivity, CUT was able to detect insecticides of high and low inhibitory power from the ng to microg range per zone. Due to high selectivity of enzyme inhibition, oxon impurities of thionophosphate standards were strongly detected, although only present in low traces. The exemplary application of HPTLC-EI (RLE) to apple juice and drinking water samples spiked with paraoxon (0.001 mg/L), parathion (0.05 mg/L) and chlorpyrifos (0.5mg/L) resulted in mean recoveries between 71 and 112% with standard deviations of 2.0-18.3%.","Journal of chromatography.

The approach described here has proven to be a useful analytical tool for unbiased pattern comparison or profiling analyses, as demonstrated with the differentiation of volatile patterns (""aroma"") from fruits such as apples, pears, and quince fruit. These volatile patterns were generated by headspace solid phase microextraction coupled to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (HS-SPME-GC x GC). The data obtained from GC x GC chromatograms were used as contour plots which were then converted to gray-scale images and analyzed utilizing a workflow derived from 2D gel-based proteomics. Run-to-run variations between GC x GC chromatograms, respectively their contour plots, have been compensated by image warping. The GC x GC images were then merged into a fusion image yielding a defined and project-wide spot (peak) consensus pattern. Within detected spot boundaries of this consensus pattern, relative quantities of the volatiles from each GC x GC image have been calculated, resulting in more than 700 gap free volatile profiles over all samples. These profiles have been used for multivariate statistical analysis and allowed clustering of comparable sample origins and prediction of unknown samples.

Several parameters of the extraction procedure such as type and volume of extraction solvent, type and volume of dispersive solvent and salt addition were evaluated to achieve the highest yield and to attain the lowest detection limits.

Furthermore, the presence and/or variable concentration of nicotinic acid and its analogues/derivates in the hypanthium could be associated with the different susceptibilities to fire blight of hosts and nonhosts and with the differential sensitivity to the disease among apple and pear varieties. Currently, no methods to specifically quantify nicotinic acid and nicotinic acid analogues/derivates in the hypanthium of apple and pear blossoms are available. This study demonstrates that E. amylovora can grow using nicotinamide and 6-hydroxynicotinic acid as alternative growth factors to nicotinic acid, but not using 2-hydroxynicotinic acid. A novel HPLC/ES-MS method was developed for the detection and quantification of nicotinic acid and its analogues/derivates directly in the hypanthium of apple and pear blossoms. Analyses established the presence of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, whereas no detectable amounts of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid and 2-hydroxynicotinic acid were observed. Mean nicotinic acid content in the pear hypanthium was found to be approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than in the apple hypanthium, which may contribute to the differential susceptibility of these two host species to fire blight. Contents of nicotinamide were in contrast similar. Nicotinic acid can therefore be considered a relevant factor in the pathogen establishment in pear blossoms, whereas nicotinamide could cover a primary role in apple blossoms.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002851', 'D044084', 'D035264', 'D027845', 'D008968', 'D009525', 'D010935', 'D031989', 'D021241']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Erwinia amylovora', 'Flowers', 'Malus', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Niacin', 'Plant Diseases', 'Pyrus', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Determination and confirmation of nicotinic acid and its analogues and derivates in pear and apple blossoms using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.,"['Q000379', 'Q000502', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000031', 'Q000382', 'Q000737', 'Q000295']","['methods', 'physiology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'microbiology', 'chemistry', 'instrumentation']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19835358,2010
19825297,"Scyphophorus acupuncatus Gyllenhal is considered to be the most significant pest of cultivated agaves in the world. Recent studies on the chemical ecology of this weevil have shown that males release a pheromone that attracts both sexes. In this study, we investigated the effect of feeding, aging, photoperiod, and time of day on pheromone release by S. acupuncatus males under laboratory conditions. The pheromone released by individual males was sampled using solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Our results show that food is an important factor because weevils deprived of plant material did not release any pheromone. In addition, we found that males fed with apple, a nonhost plant, released less pheromone than weevils fed with agave. Host odor does not seem to be important in stimulating pheromone release. We found that males as young as 1 mo were able to release pheromone, although the numbers of individuals releasing pheromone increased with age. Older males released more pheromone than younger males. We found that S. acupuncatus males released pheromone during the photophase and scotophase; there was, however, no significant peak in pheromone release.

The assay strip is composed of a paper support (1 x 10 cm), onto which AChE and a chromogenic substrate, indophenyl acetate (IPA), were entrapped using biocompatible sol-gel derived silica inks in two different zones (e.g., sensing and substrate zones). The assay protocol involves first introducing the sample to the sensing zone via lateral flow of a pesticide-containing solution. Following an incubation period, the opposite end of the paper support is placed into distilled deionized water (ddH(2)O) to allow lateral flow in the opposite direction to move paper-bound IPA to the sensing area to initiate enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of the substrate, causing a yellow-to-blue color change. The modified sensor is able to detect pesticides without the use of any external reagents with excellent detection limits (bendiocarb approximately 1 nM; carbaryl approximately 10 nM; paraoxon approximately 1 nM; malathion approximately 10 nM) and rapid response times (approximately 5 min). The sensor strip showed negligible matrix effects in detection of pesticides in spiked milk and apple juice samples.

19733738,"Liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry--LC/ESI/MS--a primary tool for analysis of low volatility compounds in difficult matrices--suffers from the matrix effects in the ESI ionization. It is well known that matrix effects can be reduced by sample dilution. However, the efficiency of simple sample dilution is often limited, in particular by the limit of detection of the method, and can strongly vary from sample to sample. In this study matrix effect is investigated as the function of dilution. It is demonstrated that in some cases dilution can eliminate matrix effect, but often it is just reduced. Based on these findings we propose a new quantitation method based on consecutive dilutions of the sample and extrapolation of the analyte content to the infinite dilution, i.e. to matrix-free solution. The method was validated for LC/ESI/MS analysis of five pesticides (methomyl, thiabendazole, aldicarb, imazalil, methiocarb) in five matrices (tomato, cucumber, apple, rye and garlic) at two concentration levels (0.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1)). Agreement between the analyzed and spiked concentrations was found for all samples. It was demonstrated that in terms of accuracy of the obtained results the proposed extrapolative dilution approach works distinctly better than simple sample dilution. The main use of this approach is envisaged for (a) method development/validation to determine the extent of matrix effects and the ways of overcoming them and (b) as a second step of analysis in the case of samples having analyte contents near the maximum residue limits (MRL).",Analytica chimica acta,[],[],Combating matrix effects in LC/ESI/MS: the extrapolative dilution approach.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733738,2009

Carbendazim (CB), thiabendazole (TB) and fuberidazole (FB) were extracted in a single step and no clean-up or concentration of extracts was needed. The high extraction efficiency obtained for BFs was a result of the different types of interactions provided by the supramolecular solvent (e.g. hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds) and the high number of solubilisation sites it contains. Besides simple and efficient, the proposed extraction approach was rapid, low-cost, environment friendly and it was implemented using conventional lab equipments.

The CCD camera is sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in spot fluorescence intensity caused by small differences in mycotoxin concentration under homogeneous illumination from a UV light source. The results of validation confirmed the efficiency of the method, which is sensitive enough to be used to quantify patulin in apple juice by producers or for government monitoring/survey programs. The method was applied to the analysis of 16 apple juice concentrate samples and patulin levels ranged from 15 to 46 microg l(-1).

19680877,"Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by species of Penicillium and Aspergillus and is toxic to a wide range of organisms, including humans and livestock. To produce large amount of pure patulin for research purposes, high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC) were applied to the purification of patulin. Apple juice was inoculated with P. expansum and containing 0.5 mg patulin per ml was used as a starting material for separation. For HSCCC, a biphasic solvent system consisted of ethyl acetate-hexane-pH 4 acetic acid (7.5:2.5:10, v/v/v) was used. For prep-HPLC, the separation was carried out in a C18 reversed-phase preparative column with a mobile phase containing acetonitrile-pH 4 acetic acid (5:95, v/v). Fractions containing patulin were collected and analysed by analytical HPLC and identified by congruent retention time and ultraviolet/visible (UV-VIS) spectrum of the standard. The structure of the purified patulin was confirmed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. HSCCC produced 21.9 mg of patulin from 50 ml apple juice culture whereas the prep-HPLC yielded 18.1 mg. HSCCC also produced purer patulin than the prep-HPLC (98.6 versus 96.3%) and higher recovery (86.2 versus 71.3%). In addition, the HSCCC method is advantageous for its lower cost and a simpler procedure compared with the prep-HPLC. This one-step HSCCC method can potentially provide a simple, effective and environmentally friendly tool for obtaining gram-level pure patulin for toxicology, detoxification and many other patulin-related studies.","Food additives & contaminants.

The curves for the decay of the main carotenoids and color changes showed a biphasic behavior that was best fitted by a biexponential equation. For the same heating conditions (60 or 90 degrees C), similar rate constants for the fast (gamma(1)) and slow (gamma(2)) decays were obtained for both the chemical (carotenoids) and physical (color) parameters monitored in the present research. This fact indicates that color parameters, such as DeltaE*, are good predictors of both all-trans-beta-cryptoxanthin and all-trans-beta-carotene thermal degradation.

Results showed that when the assay medium was in the optimized condition (phosphate buffer solution [PBS] containing 10% [v/v] methanol and 0.2 mol/L NaCl at a pH value of 5.0), the sensitivity (estimated as the IC(50) value) and the limit of detection (LOD, estimated as the IC(10) value) were 1.19 and 0.08 ng/ml, respectively. The precision investigation indicated that the intraassay precision values all were below 10% and that the interassay precision values ranged from 4.89 to 19.12%.

After the whole trees were shaded with the sun-light about 50-55% for 20 days, AsA levels were significantly decreased in fruit peel, flesh and leaves, while mRNA expression levels and activities of L-galactose dehydrogenase (L-GalDH, EC 1.1.1.117) and L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (L-GalLDH, EC 1.3.2.3) as well as activities of recycling enzymes was clearly declined in the leaf and peel but not in the flesh. By shading fruits only for 20 days, AsA levels, relative mRNA levels and activities of L-GalDH and L-GalLDH as well as activities of recycling enzymes all showed obvious decrease in the peel, but not in the flesh.

19306997,"A simple and sensitive method for the determination of patulin in fruit juice and dried fruit samples was developed using a fully automated method consisting of in-tube solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Patulin was separated within 5 min by high-performance liquid chromatography using a Synergi MAX-RP 80A column and water/acetonitrile (80/20, v/v) as the mobile phase. Electrospray ionization conditions in the negative ion mode were optimized for MS detection of patulin. The pseudo-molecular ion [M-H](-) was used to detect patulin in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The optimum in-tube SPME conditions were 25 draw/eject cycles of 40 microL of sample using a Carboxen 1006 PLOT capillary column as an extraction device. The extracted patulin was readily desorbed from the capillary by passage of the mobile phase, and no carry-over was observed. Using the in-tube SPME LC-MS with SIM method, good linearity of the calibration curve (r=0.9996) was obtained in the concentration range of 0.5-20 ng/mL using (13)C(3)-patulin as an internal standard, and the detection limit (S/N=3) of patulin was 23.5 pg/mL. The in-tube SPME method showed >83-fold higher sensitivity than the direct injection method (10 microL injection volume).

Disruption of both C. pomonella and G. molesta male orientation to pheromone traps in plots treated with a dual-species formulation (Isomate CM/OFM TT), simultaneously releasing the pheromone components of both C. pomonella and G. molesta, was equivalent to that obtained by treating plots with separate formulations for each species (Isomate C Plus or Isomate C TT for C. pomonella and Isomate M Rosso for G. molesta) through mid-season. However, disruption efficacy of the dual-species formulation was significantly lower near the end of the season for G. molesta compared with the Isomate M Rosso formulation because of depletion of active ingredients and coincided with a slight increase in fruit injury. Effective disruption of C. pomonella and G. molesta also was obtained with a multispecies formulation (Isomate CM/OFM/LR) that releases the main pheromone components of C. pomonella, G. molesta, and several leafroller species. Each formulation type releasing (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol (codlemone) also was found to release the E,Z- and Z,E-isomers of codlemone. Our data provide further evidence that simultaneous disruption of C. pomonella and G. molesta with dispensers releasing both species' pheromone components is possible; however, the controlled release formulations tested here require modification or postponed deployment coupled with early season control by other means to achieve season-long efficacy.

19249817,"The pomegranate fruit ( Punica granatum ) has become an international high-value crop for the production of commercial pomegranate juice (PJ). The perceived consumer value of PJ is due in large part to its potential health benefits based on a significant body of medical research conducted with authentic PJ. To establish criteria for authenticating PJ, a new International Multidimensional Authenticity Specifications (IMAS) algorithm was developed through consideration of existing databases and comprehensive chemical characterization of 45 commercial juice samples from 23 different manufacturers in the United States. In addition to analysis of commercial juice samples obtained in the United States, data from other analyses of pomegranate juice and fruits including samples from Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Syria, India, and China were considered in developing this protocol. There is universal agreement that the presence of a highly constant group of six anthocyanins together with punicalagins characterizes polyphenols in PJ. At a total sugar concentration of 16 degrees Brix, PJ contains characteristic sugars including mannitol at >0.3 g/100 mL. Ratios of glucose to mannitol of 4-15 and of glucose to fructose of 0.8-1.0 are also characteristic of PJ. In addition, no sucrose should be present because of isomerase activity during commercial processing. Stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry as > -25 per thousand assures that there is no added corn or cane sugar added to PJ. Sorbitol was present at <0.025 g/100 mL; maltose and tartaric acid were not detected. The presence of the amino acid proline at >25 mg/L is indicative of added grape products. Malic acid at >0.1 g/100 mL indicates adulteration with apple, pear, grape, cherry, plum, or aronia juice. Other adulteration methods include the addition of highly concentrated aronia, blueberry, or blackberry juices or natural grape pigments to poor-quality juices to imitate the color of pomegranate juice, which results in abnormal anthocyanin profiles. To adjust the astringent taste of poor-quality juice or peel extract, addition of nonpomegranate sugars is a commonly detected adulteration method. The profile generated from these analyses combined with information from existing databases and published literature has been integrated into a validated IMAS for PJ, which can be utilized to detect PJ adulteration.

In this work, we report the development of a method that detects ricin and its activity in food or clinical samples. This method involves immunocapture of the toxin, an examination of the activity of the ricin protein upon a DNA substrate that mimics the toxin's natural RNA target, and analysis of tryptic fragments of the toxin itself. It is the combination of these three techniques, all performed on the same sample, which allows for a sensitive and selective analysis of ricin isolated from a food or clinical sample.

19224664,"All aphid species studied so far share the same sex pheromone components, nepetalactol and nepetalactone. Variation by different enantiomers and blends of the two components released by different aphid species are limited and can only partially explain species-specific attraction of males to females. While some host-plant odours are known to enhance specific attraction of aphid species, herbivore-induced plant volatiles that synergise attractiveness to the sex pheromone are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that for the host-alternating rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini)) specificity of attraction of males to females is triggered by female-induced tree odours in combination with a 1:8 ratio of (4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactone and (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactol. Female aphid infestation induces increased release of four esters (hexyl butyrate, (E)-2-hexenyl butyrate, (Z)-3-hexenyl 3-methylbutyrate and hexyl 2-methylbutyrate) from apple leaves. Two different combinations of three esters applied in a 1:1:1 ratio increase the number of male D. plantaginea and decrease the number of other aphid species caught in water traps in the presence of the pheromone components. The ester blend alone was not attractive. Combination of the pheromone blend with each single ester was not increasing attraction of male D. plantaginea.

The optimal separation was performed on a Sephadex LH-20 column using gradient aqueous ethanol as eluting solvent from 0% to 100% in increments of 10%.

To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside.

This implies that the wall of the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract.

The ablated material was transported with argon as carrier gas to a quadrupole-based ICP-MS (ICP-QMS), and the ion intensities of (39)K(+), (24)Mg(+), (55)Mn(+), (63)Cu(+), (31)P(+), (34)S(+) and (11)B(+) were measured by ICP-QMS to study the distribution of the elements of interest. The imaging technique using LA-ICP-MS on plant leaves does not require any sample preparation. Carbon ((13)C(+)) was used as an internal standard element to compensate for the difference in the amount of material ablated. Additional experiments were performed in order to study the influence of the water content of the analyzed leaves on the intensity signal of the analyte. For quantification purposes, standard reference material (NIST SRM 1515 Apple Leaves) was selected and doped with standard solutions of the analytes within the concentration range of 0.1-2000 mg L(-1). The synthetic laboratory standards together with the samples were measured by LA-ICP-MS. The shape and structure of the leaves was clearly given by LA-ICP-MS imaging of all the elements measured. The elemental distribution varied according to the element, but with a high content in the veins for all the elements investigated. Specifically, Cu was located uniformly in the mesophyll with a slightly higher concentration in the main vein. High ion intensity was measured for S with a high amount of this element in the veins similar to the images of the metals, whereas most of the B was detected at the tip of the leaf. With synthetic laboratory standard calibration, the concentrations of elements in the leaves measured by LA-ICP-MS were between 20 microg g(-1) for Cu and 14,000 microg g(-1) for K.",Talanta,"['D002138', 'D004602', 'D005502', 'D007834', 'D013058', 'D008670', 'D018515']","['Calibration', 'Elements', 'Food', 'Lasers', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metals', 'Plant Leaves']",Imaging of nutrient elements in the leaves of Elsholtzia splendens by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, None, 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19174215,2009

The enzyme catalysed the incorporation of putrescine into the cytoskeleton monomers. When tested on actin filaments, pollen TGase induced the formation of high-molecular-mass aggregates of actin. Use of fluorescein-cadaverine showed that the labelled polyamine was incorporated into actin by pollen TGase, similar to with guinea pig liver TGase. The pollen TGase also reduced the enzyme activity and the binding of myosin to TGase-treated actin filaments. Polymerization of tubulin in the presence of pollen TGase also yielded the formation of high-molecular-mass aggregates. Furthermore, the pollen TGase also affected the binding of kinesin to microtubules and reduced the motility of microtubules along kinesin-coated slides.

The main aim of this paper was to utilize two electrochemical detectors (amperometric - Coulouchem III and coulometric - CoulArray) coupled with flow injection analysis for the detection of ascorbic acid. Primarily, we optimized the experimental conditions. The optimized conditions were as follows: detector potential 100 mV, temperature 25 °C, mobile phase 0.09% TFA:ACN, 3:97 (v/v) and flow rate 0.13 mL·min-1. The tangents of the calibration curves were 0.3788 for the coulometric method and 0.0136 for the amperometric one. The tangent of the calibration curve measured by the coulometric detector was almost 30 times higher than the tangent measured by the amperometric detector. Consequently, we coupled a CoulArray electrochemical detector with high performance liquid chromatography and estimated the detection limit for AA as 90 nM (450 fmol per 5 μL injection). The method was used for the determination of vitamin C in a pharmaceutical preparations (98 ± 2 mg per tablet), in oranges (Citrus aurantium) (varied from 30 to 56 mg/100 g fresh weight), in apples (Malus sp.)

It was based on solid phase extraction of copper(II) ions on a minicolumn of Amberlite XAD-2 loaded with 2-(2-thiazolylazo)-5-dimethylaminophenol (TAM). The optimisation process was carried out using Doehlert designs. Four variables (sampling flow rate, SR; elution flow rate, buffer concentration, BC; and pH) were regarded as factors in the optimisation. The parameter ""sensitivity efficiency (SE)"" proposed in this paper, and defined as the analytical signal obtained for an on-line enrichment system for a preconcentration time of 1 min was used as analytical response in the optimisation process. Using the established experimental conditions, the proposed on-line system allowed determination of copper with detection limit (3sigma/S) of 0.23 mug l(-1), and a precision (repeatability), calculated as relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 3.9 and 3.7% for copper concentration of 5.00 and 20.00 mug l(-1), respectively. The preconcentration factor obtained is 62. The recovery achieved for copper determination in presence of several cations demonstrated that this has enough selectivity for analysis of food samples.

The optimum experimental conditions for quantitative recoveries of analytes (amount of sorbent, pH of sample, concentration and kind of eluent, flow rates of sample and eluent and adding of the effect of complexing agent) were investigated. Nickel was quantitatively retained at pH6 irrespective of whether it was complexed with APDC while the quantitative sorption of lead was achieved at pH8 only if it was treated with APDC prior to passing through the sorbent. The lead and nickel retained on the sorbent were eluted drawing and discharging 4.5 M HNO(3), respectively. If the concentration of analyte elements in the sample were too low to be detected, then they were concentrated by increasing the ratio of sample value to eluent volume as needed. The lead and nickel in spiked sea-water samples and in certified reference Apple-Leaves (NIST SRM 1515) standards were quantitatively (95%) recovered with R.S.D. of around +/-2%.",Talanta,[],[],Determination of lead and nickel in Apple-Leaves and sea-water by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry after solid-phase extraction using Chromosorb-107 filled in a syringe.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18969041,2012

Using reversed phase octasilyl-derivatised silica (C8) as dispersant and ethyl acetate as extraction solvent, two sonication devices, an ultrasonic bath and a sonoreactor, were tested for speeding and increasing the efficiency of the MSPD process. A standard MSPD and a heating-assisted MSPD procedure were also done. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for analyte determination. 1-min sonication with the sonoreactor at 50% amplitude provided the best results, with reproducibilities below 15% for the pesticides studied.

18943357,"ABSTRACT Contamination of apples (Malus domestica) and derived juices with fungicide residues and patulin produced by Penicillium expansum are major issues of food safety. Biocontrol agents represent an alternative or supplement to chemicals for disease control. Our data show that these microbes could also contribute to actively decreasing patulin accumulation in apples. Three biocontrol agents, Rhodotorula glutinis LS11, Cryptococcus laurentii LS28, and Aureobasidium pullulans LS30, were examined for their in vitro growth in the presence of patulin and for their capability to decrease mycotoxin recovery from the medium. Strain LS11 yielded the highest growth rates and the greatest decrease of toxin recoveries. Further, it caused the appearance of two major spots on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates, suggesting possible metabolization of the mycotoxin. In vivo, i.e., in the low percentage of LS11-pretreated apples infected by P. expansum, patulin accumulation was significantly lower than in nontreated infected fruits. Yeast cells survived and increased in infected apples and, in a model system emulating decaying apple, resulted in accelerated breakdown of patulin and the production of the same TLC spots as those detected in vitro. These data suggest that biocontrol yeast cells surviving in decaying apples could metabolize patulin and/or negatively affect its accumulation or synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the effect of a biocontrol agent on patulin accumulation in vivo.",Phytopathology,[],[],Effect of the Biocontrol Yeast Rhodotorula glutinis Strain LS11 on Patulin Accumulation in Stored Apples.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18943357,2012
18925621,"Implementation of an uncomplicated SPE process for the rapid extraction and preconcentration of the alkaloids, colchicine, strychnine, aconitine, and nicotine, from water, apple juice, and nonfat milk samples is presented. When coupled to analysis via micellar EKC (MEKC), the total analysis time per sample was less than 15 min for the water and juice samples and less than 20 min for the milk. The SPE process allowed for anywhere from a three to a fourteen-fold improvement in the LOD for each alkaloid when compared to detecting the alkaloids in a nontreated water sample matrix. Following SPE, the LODs for colchicine, strychnine, and nicotine were sufficient to meet levels from 150 to 5000 times more dilute than the LD(50) for a 50 kg individual drinking 12 oz of a contaminated beverage. Aconitine, on the other hand, was detected at approximately the LD(50) level. The percent recoveries for the SPE ranged from 37% to as high as 99%.

18774823,"Reactive dicarbonyl species, such as methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO), have received extensive attention recently due to their high reactivity and ability to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs) with biological substances such as proteins, phospholipids, and DNA. In the present study, we found that both phloretin and its glucoside, phloridzin, the major bioactive apple polyphenols, could efficiently trap reactive MGO or GO to form mono- and di-MGO or GO adducts under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C). More than 80% MGO was trapped within 10 min, and 68% GO was trapped within 24 h by phloretin. Phloridzin also had strong trapping efficiency by quenching more than 70% MGO and 60% GO within 24 h. The glucosylation of the hydroxyl group at position 2 could significantly slow down the trapping rate and the formation of MGO or GO adducts. The products formed from phloretin (or phloridzin) and MGO (or GO), combined at different ratios, were analyzed using LC/MS. We successfully purified the major mono-MGO adduct of phloridzin and found that it was a mixture of tautomers based on the one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra. Our LC/MS and NMR data showed that positions 3 and 5 of the phloretin or phloridzin A ring were the major active sites for trapping reactive dicarbonyl species. We also found that phloretin was more reactive than lysine and arginine in terms of trapping reactive dicarbonyl species, MGO or GO.

Flavan-3-ols are the most abundant subclass of flavonoids in these types of foods. Three apple-derived procyanidin fractions with different average degrees of polymerization (aDP) were characterized and the effects of these fractions and of pure flavan-3-ol monomers ((-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin) and dimers (B1, B2) on two OA cell lines were investigated. Flavan-3-ol monomers and dimers had no effect on the two cell lines, while apple-derived flavan-3-ol oligomers and polymers induced a time-dependent reduction of cell viability. The reduction in the cell viability was due to the induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis and an arrest of the cell cycle in G0/G1. The magnitude of the reduction in cell viability and induction of apoptosis after exposure to flavan-3-ol oligomeric/polymeric fractions positively correlated with their aDP. These results indicate that only flavan-3-ol oligomers and polymers, but not monomers and dimers, have an effect on the proliferation of OA cells in vitro.

The minimum fluorescence values produced by both fluorometer types in response to a reversible low-oxygen stress in apples were indistinguishable: both Fo and Falpha increased when O2 levels were lowered below the anaerobic compensation point (ACP); when gas levels returned to normoxia both parameters dipped below, then returned to, the original fluorescence baseline. The two parameters also responded similarly to the irreversible osmotic stress in grapes: in both cultivars, Falpha and Fo first decreased before reaching an inflection point at approximately 20% mass loss and then increased towards a second inflection point. However, the two parameters were not analogous under the irreversible osmotic stress; most notably, the relative Falpha values appeared to be lower than Fo during the later stages of dehydration. This was likely due to the influence of the Fm parameter and an overestimation of Falpha when measuring the fluorescence from healthy and responsive chloroplasts as found in grapes experiencing minimal water loss, but not in grapes undergoing moderate to severe dehydration.

18636987,"Alcohol acyltransferases (AATs) are key enzymes in ester biosynthesis. Previous studies have found that AAT may be a stress-related gene. To investigate further the function of the apple alcohol acyltransferase gene (MdAAT2), transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing MdAAT2 were generated. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis showed that the volatile blends were altered in these transgenic tobacco leaves. Although no apple-fruity volatile esters were detected in transgenic tobacco leaves, methyl caprylate, methyl caprate, and methyl dodecanoate were newly generated, and the concentrations of methyl benzoate and methyl tetradecanoate were significantly increased, suggesting that MdAAT2 may use medium-chain fatty acyl CoA and benzoyl-CoA as acyl donors together with methanol acceptors as substrates. Surprisingly, the concentrations of linalool were significantly increased in transgenic tobacco leaves, which may mediate the repellent effect on Myzus persicae (Sulzer) aphids. Using methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and wounding treatments, we found that MdAAT2 may substitute for the partial ability of MeJA to induce the production of linalool in transgenic plants.

Apple fruit is a major source of phenol compounds, because its consumption is widespread in many countries and it is available on the market for the whole year. The phenolic composition of 67 varieties of apple cultivars (new and old varieties) was examined for the concentration of some important phytochemicals and antioxidant activity. For the first time, we have looked at the correlation and compared polyphenolic coumpounds in Golden Delicious variety and new varieties grown from it. Up to 18 compounds, including catechin, procyanidin, hydroxycinnamates, flavonols, anthocyanins, and dihydrochalcones, were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis and LC-MS.

18425747,"As pectin molecules are too large and heterogeneous to analyze as a whole, the polymer is usually degraded to smaller oligomers, which are often analyzed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC). However, the high salt concentration necessary to elute pectin oligomers by HPAEC is incompatible with online mass detection. To overcome such a disadvantage, a CE-IT-MS system was set up to further elucidate the fine structure of charged oligosaccharides. An effective separation of differently substituted galacturonic acid containing oligomers was obtained by low-pH CE-LIF analysis. By adapting the buffer and capillary online MS detection was enabled. Moreover, with MS/MS it was possible to localize sugar residues' substitutions. With this combined CE-MS approach LIF electropherograms of xylogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan I digests could be annotated. The method was further exemplified by a complex oligomer mixture of acid hydrolyzed apple pectin, which was separated and characterized by CE-MSn.

The aim of the present study was to determine which apple constituents contribute to potential chemopreventive activities, using a bioactivity-directed approach. A polyphenol-enriched apple juice extract was fractionated by various techniques. Extract and fractions were tested in a series of test systems indicative of cancer preventive potential. These test systems measured antioxidant effects, modulation of carcinogen metabolism, anti-inflammatory and antihormonal activities, and antiproliferative potential. Regression analyses indicated that 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging potential correlated with the sum of low molecular weight (LMW) antioxidants (including chlorogenic acid, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols) and procyanidins, whereas peroxyl radicals were more effectively scavenged by LMW compounds than by procyanidins. Quercetin aglycone was identified as a potent Cyp1A inhibitor, whereas phloretin and (-)-epicatechin were the most potent cyclooxygenase 1 (Cox-1) inhibitors. Aromatase and Cyp1A inhibitory potential and cytotoxicity toward HCT116 colon cancer cells increased with increasing content in procyanidins.

Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major periodontal pathogen, triggers a series of cellular inflammatory responses including the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which causes periodontal destruction; thus, anti-inflammatory reagents are considered beneficial for periodontal therapy. In the present study, we examined whether hop- and apple-derived polyphenols (HBP and ACT, respectively) inhibit PGE2 production by human gingival epithelial (HGE) cells stimulated with P. gingivalis components. HGE cells were stimulated with P. gingivalis membrane vesicles, and the effects of HBP, ACT and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) on PGE2 production by HGE cells were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Profiles of methanol-extractable leaf phenolics of two apple (Malus x domestica) genotypes with contrasting susceptibility to this disease were analyzed by HPLC after infection. Some qualitative differences were recorded between the constitutive compositions of the two genotypes but in both of them dihydrochalcones accounted for more than 90% of total phenolics. Principal component analysis separated leaves inoculated with a virulent wild-type strain from those inoculated with a non-pathogenic TTSS-defective mutant or with water. The changes in levels of the various groups of phenolics in response to the virulent bacterium were similar between the two genotypes, with a significant decrease of dihydrochalcones and a significant increase of hydroxycinnamate derivatives. Differences between genotypes were, however, recorded in amplitude and kinetic of variation in these groups. Occurrence of oxidation and polymerization reactions is proposed, based on the browning process of infected tissues, but whether some by-products act in defense as toxic compounds remain to be tested. Among direct antibacterial constitutive compounds present in apple leaves, the dihydrochalcone phloretin only was found at levels close to lethal concentrations in both genotypes.

18256050,"Whole apple fruit (Malus domestica Borkh.) widely differing in pigment content and composition has been examined by recording its chlorophyll fluorescence excitation and diffuse reflection spectra in the visible and near UV regions. Spectral bands sensitive to the pigment concentration have been identified, and linear models for non-destructive assessment of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols via chlorophyll fluorescence measurements are put forward. The adaptation of apple fruit to high light stress involves accumulation of these protective pigments, which absorb solar radiation in broad spectral ranges extending from UV to the green and, in anthocyanin-containing cultivars, to the red regions of the spectrum. In ripening apples the protective effect in the blue region could be attributed to extrathylakoid carotenoids. A simple model, which allows the simulation of chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectra in the visible range and a quantitative evaluation of competitive absorption by anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols, is described. Evidence is presented to support the view that anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols play, in fruit with low-to-moderate pigment content, the role of internal traps (insofar as they compete with chlorophylls for the absorption of incident light in specific spectral bands), affecting thereby the shape of the chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectrum.",Journal of experimental botany,"['D000872', 'D002338', 'D002734', 'D044948', 'D005638', 'D027845', 'D008956', 'D013050', 'D013472']","['Anthocyanins', 'Carotenoids', 'Chlorophyll', 'Flavonols', 'Fruit', 'Malus', 'Models, Chemical', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Sunlight']","Effect of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols on chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectra in apple fruit: signature analysis, assessment, modelling, and relevance to photoprotection.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18256050,2008

In this work, salidroside and other natural glucosides such as cinnamyl O-beta-d-glucopyranoside and 4-methoxybenzyl O-beta-d-glucopyranoside were efficiently synthesized via an environmentally benign and energy economic process. In the synthetic process, apple seed, easily available from discards of fruit processing factories, was employed as a natural and green catalyst. Moreover, all of the catalyst, solvent and excessive substrate was reused or recycled. The biocatalytic reaction was carried out in a clean and less toxic medium of aqueous tert-butanol and the glucoside produced was selectively removed from reaction mixture by alumina column adsorption, making excessive substrate (aglycon) recyclable for a repeated use in the next batch of reaction. For improvement of the biocatalyst stability, apple seed meal was further cross-linked by glutaraldehyde, yielding a net-like porous structure within which the dissociating proteins were immobilized, resulting in improved permeability of the biocatalyst. After the simple cross-linking treatment, the half-life of apple seed catalyst was significantly improved from 29 days to 51 days.

These esterases were selected because of their high sensitivity to the examined insecticide classes and their pronounced inhibition profile. With inhibition constants (ki) of 2.0x10(7) and 2.6x10(6) L/(mol.min) for rabbit liver esterase and BS2, respectively, chlorpyrifos oxon proved to be the strongest inhibitor directly followed by paraoxon. As compared to choline esterases and the recently studied cutinase, both esterases are surprisingly strongly inhibited by organophosphorus thions, showing k i in the range of 5.3x10(2) to 2.3x10(4) L/(mol.min). All tested insecticidal carbamates were also inhibitors of BS2 and rabbit liver esterase, albeit in a rather uniform manner. Generally, both enzymes were found to be about 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive on the studied insecticides than cutinase even with an enhanced sensitivity against plant matrix effects.

The identification of polyphenol metabolites formed via their passage through the small intestine of healthy ileostomy subjects after apple juice consumption is presented. Identification and quantification of polyphenols and their metabolites were performed using HPLC-DAD as well as HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Total procyanidin content (TPA) was measured, and additionally the mean degree of polymerization (DPm) of the procyanidins was determined in the apple juice and ileostomy effluents. As products of polyphenol metabolism, D-(-)-quinic acid and methyl esters of caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid are liberated from the corresponding hydroxycinnamic acid esters. 1-Caffeoylquinic acid and 3-caffeoylquinic acid were determined as products of isomerization. Phloretin 2'-O-glucoside (phloridzin) and phloretin 2'-O-xyloglucoside were metabolized into the corresponding aglycons phloretin and phloretin 2'-O-glucuronide and all were found in the ileostomy effluent. Ninety percent of the consumed procyanidins were recovered in the ileostomy effluent and therefore would reach the colon under physiologic circumstances.

However, food packaging materials that release 1-MCP at a predictable rate into the package headspace might be useful for application in inhibiting the deleterious effects of ethylene in the postharvest packaging and storage of some horticultural products. A 1-MCP/alpha-cyclodextrin (1-MCP-cd) complex was incorporated into several common packaging films by heat-pressing (dry-blend, lamination) and solution-casting methods. The release of 1-MCP from the films was quantified by gas chromatography with respect to time, loading of 1-MCP, temperature, relative humidity (RH), type of film, and film-forming method. Release of 1-MCP was rapid and high in films held at RH >/= 75%. The rate of release was slow during the 1st 12 h and then increased during the next 24 to 36 h. Higher temperatures resulted in higher and faster release. A loading of 8 mg of 1-MCP-cd per 140 mg of polymer was found to be optimal. Pressing 1-MCP-cd containing films above 100 degrees C reduced the amount of 1-MCP remaining in the film.

For APs results are in a good agreement with matrix-matched standards. To evaluate errors of determination of concentration synthetic samples at concentration level of pesticides 50 ng mL(-1) (50 microg kg(-1)) were analyzed and quantified using the above given standards.

The quantification of anthocyanins in M. pumila cultivars revealed that Cranberry, Kerr, and Niedzwetzkyana contained 1.12, 0.55, and 0.36 mg/g of fresh weight of 1, respectively. The lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX) inhibitory activities of 1 in water were compared with the activities of cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside (2) and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (3) found in cherries and berries. There is a significant increase in LPO and COX enzyme-inhibitory activities of anthocyanin when tested in water compared to using dimethylsulfoxide as the carrier. The LPO inhibition of anthocyanins 1, 2, and 3 were 53.3, 68.3, and 87.9, respectively, at a 0.25 microM concentration.

Identification of the O157 antigen is an essential part of the detection and management of E. coli O157:H7. A quadroma P126 secreting a bispecific hybrid MAb (bsMAb), which recognizes both E. coli O157 and horseradish peroxidase in one molecule was produced by somatic hybridization of hybridomas specific for E. coli O157 and HRPO molecule. A bridge ELISA was used to select the quadromas obtained for bispecific monoclonal antibody purification and characterization. Benzhydroxamic-acid agarose (BHA) affinity co-chromatography was used as a convenient one-step method for purifying the HRPO-bsMAb complex for ultrasensitive diagnostic applications. Sandwich ELISA for detecting E. coli O157:H7 with HRPO-bsMAb allows quick one step detection of spiked E. coli O157:H7. The detection sensitivities were 100 CFU, 750 CFU and 500 CFU per 1 ml of tap water, lake water and apple juice respectively by microtiter assay. E. coli O157:H7 detection with immunofilter ELISA and immunomagnetic ELISA formats was approximately 1 CFU/ml and 10 CFU/ml respectively. BsMAbs avoid enzyme conjugation, has highest specific activity and molecular uniformity without aggregates and contribute to good signal to noise ratios.

In this study, colloidal graphite was investigated as an alternative matrix for laser desorption/ionization (GALDI) in IMS. We demonstrate its advantages over conventional MALDI in the detection of small molecules such as organic acids, flavonoids, and oligosaccharides. GALDI provides good sensitivity for such small molecules. The detection limit of fatty acids and flavonoids in the negative-ion mode are in the low-femtomole range. Molecules were detected directly and identified by comparing the MS and MS/MS spectra with those of standards.

Present in a wide range of vegetables and fruits, flavonoids form an integral part of the human diet and confer multiple health benefits. Here, we report on metabolic engineering of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathways in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) by overexpression of the maize (Zea mays L.) leaf colour (Lc) regulatory gene. The Lc gene was transferred into the M. domestica cultivar Holsteiner Cox via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation which resulted in enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in regenerated shoots. Five independent Lc lines were investigated for integration of Lc into the plant genome by Southern blot and PCR analyses. The Lc-transgenic lines contained one or two Lc gene copies and showed increased mRNA levels for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylase (FHT), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), leucoanthocyanidin reductases (LAR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR).

In this study, the effect of three different diets - normal piglets starter without additives, with apple pomace or with red-wine pomace - on the intestinal morphology was investigated from 3 days prior to weaning to 4 weeks post-weaning. At five time points, six piglets from each treatment group were slaughtered; at first time point only six animals from control group were slaughtered. Villus height, crypt depth and breadth of villi and crypts were determined in the jejunum, ileum and colon in 78 piglets. Additionally, the area of the Peyer's patches in the ileum was measured. In jejunum (p < 0.01) and ileum (p < 0.001) the villus length in the control group decreased after weaning but increased over the entire feeding experiment (p < 0.001). In the two-pomace groups, no decrease was measured after weaning. In jejunum, an increase in villi breadth occurred, 73% in the control group and approximately 10% in both treatment groups. A 35% increase was found in the ileum in all groups. Peyer's patches area increased approximately 21% in the control group over 26 days of treatment, whereas in other groups no significant differences were found.

To gain insight into the aroma compounds responsible for such odor changes, a comparative aroma extract dilution analysis was applied on unstored, raw Arabica coffee beans from Colombia (water content=11.75%) and on the same beans with a water content of 13.5%, which were stored for 9 months at 40 degrees C. In combination with the flavor dilution (FD) factors, the results of the identification experiments showed strong increases in (E)-beta-damascenone (cooked apple-like), 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (clove-like), and methyl 2-methyl- and methyl 3-methylbutanoate (fruity), whereas others, such as the earthy smelling 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine as well as 2-phenylethanol and 3-methoxyphenol, remained unchanged during storage. In addition, the previously unknown coffee odorant 2-methoxy-5-vinylphenol (intense smoky odor) increased significantly during storage. Quantitative measurements performed on raw coffee samples stored at various temperatures, water contents, and oxygen availabilities indicated that the significant increase of, in particular, the methyl esters of 2- and 3-methylbutanoic acid were responsible for the pronounced and fruity odor quality perceived in the stored green coffee, whereas the higher concentrations of 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and 2-methoxy-5-vinylphenol led to the more pronounced smoky, clove-like odor quality.

Transgenic line no. 32, which was revealed to have the highest Spd accumulation and expression level of MdSPDS1, showed the strongest tolerance to these stresses. When growth increments, electrolyte leakage (EL), and values of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were monitored, line no. 32 showed the lowest growth inhibition and the least increase in EL or TBARS under stress conditions.

Roem.) and to acquire basic data for the conservation and utilization of the species, aroma components in ripe fruit of M. sieversii obtained from 30 seedlings at Mohe, Gongliu County, Xinjiang Autonomic Region, China, and in ripe fruit of 4 M. pumila cultivars ('Ralls', 'Delicious', 'Golden Delicious', and 'Fuji') were analyzed using head space-solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the values of similarity coefficient concerning volatile types between the two species were in accordance with the evolution of M. pumila cultivars (forms), and that M. sieversii seedlings showed considerable genetic variations in these aspects: the total content of volatile components, the classes and contents of each compound classes, the segregation ratio, and content of main components. The results showed significant difference among seedlings and wide genetic diversity within the populations. Comparison of the volatile components in M. sieversii with those in M. pumila cultivars showed that the common compounds whose number were larger than five with the contents over 0.04 mg/L simultaneously between M. sieversii and M. pumila cultivars belonged to esters, alcohols, aldehydes or ketones. This suggests fundamental identity in main volatile components of M. sieversii and M. pumila cultivars. The results above sustained the conclusion ""M. sieversii is probably the ancestor of M. pumila"". However, there were 48 compounds present in M. pumila that were not detected in M. sieversii, including 6 character impact components (i.e., propyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenal, 2-methyl-1-butanol acetate, pentyl acetate, 3-furanmethanol, and benzene acetaldehyde). This suggested that in the domestication of M. pumila, introgression of other apple species, except for M. sieversii, by interspecies hybridization was possible. There were 177 compounds in total belonging to 11 classes detected in 30 M. sieversii seedlings, including esters, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, acids, benzene ramifications, terpenes, heterocycles, hydrocarbon derivates, acetals, and lactones.

However, serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels increased following the intake of dietary APP. Further, dietary APP inhibited the increase in lipid peroxide levels in the liver and serum by COPs. The activity of hepatic Delta6 desaturase was lowered by dietary APP in a dose-dependent manner, although exogenous COPs generally increased the activity of this enzyme. In keeping with this observation, Delta6 desaturation indices in the phospholipids and cholesteryl esters of the liver and serum lipids were lower in the APP-fed groups than those in the control group. Dietary APP also promoted the excretion of exogenous COPs, cholesterol, and acidic steroids in feces. Therefore, the inhibition of intestinal absorption of COPs may partly contribute to the alleviation of the perturbation of lipid metabolism and lipid peroxidation levels. Thus, APP may be an important removal agent of exogenous toxic material such as COPs contained in processed or fast foods.",Lipids,"['D000818', 'D001835', 'D002791', 'D002849', 'D004789', 'D004912', 'D005243', 'D005419', 'D007408', 'D050356', 'D008054', 'D008055', 'D027845', 'D013058', 'D015394', 'D010084', 'D010636', 'D059808', 'D011453', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D013256', 'D013482']","['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Cholesterol, Dietary', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythrocytes', 'Feces', 'Flavonoids', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxides', 'Lipids', 'Malus', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenols', 'Polyphenols', 'Prostaglandins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Steroids', 'Superoxide Dismutase']",Absorption of dietary cholesterol oxidation products and their downstream metabolic effects are reduced by dietary apple polyphenols.,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000008', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000097', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000008', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'administration & dosage', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'blood', 'chemistry', None, None, 'drug effects', 'administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17393221,2007

Enzymatic assays for d-glucose, d-fructose, sucrose, D-sorbitol/xylitol, L-malic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, and L-glutamic acid were miniaturized from the standard 3 mL assays in cuvettes into assays of 200 microL or lower in 96 or 384 well microplates. The miniaturization and the automation were achieved with a four channel automatic liquid handling system in order to reduce the dispensing errors and to obtain an increased sample throughput. Performance factors (limit of detection, linearity of calibration curve, and repeatability) of the assays with standard solutions were proven to be satisfactory. The automated and miniaturized assays were validated with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses for the quantification of sugars and acids in tomato and apple extracts. The high correlation between the two techniques for the different components indicates that the high-throughput microplate enzymatic assays can serve as a fast, reliable, and inexpensive alternative for HPLC as the standard analysis technique in the taste characterization of fruit and vegetables.

17261018,"Anthocyanins (Anths) in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) berries harvested at véraison from Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier cultivars were assessed nondestructively by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) excitation spectra. With increasing Anth content, less excitation light was transmitted to the deeper Chl layers, and thus the ChlF signal decreased proportionally. By applying Beer-Lambert's law, the logarithm of the ratio between the fluorescence excitation spectra (log FER) from a green and a red berry gave the in vivo absorption spectrum of Anths, which peaked at about 540 nm. Absolute quantitative nondestructive determination of Anths for each berry was obtained by the log FER calculated for two excitation wavelengths, 540 and 635 nm (absorbed and not-absorbed by Anths, respectively) of ChlF at 685 nm. Over a range of skin colors going from green to purple, the relationship between the log [ChlF(635)/ChlF(540)] and the Anth concentration of berry extracts was fairly well fitted (r 2 = 0.92) using a power function.

The log FER Anth index was superior to the reflectance-ratio-based index, but was as good as the color index for red grapes (CIRG) calculated from the whole visible reflectance spectrum.

Further, all four known apple allergens were localized on a 2-DE map and they were matched with spots recognized by sera of patients with different allergic patterns. Moreover, a new, putative allergen could be identified using MS. We evaluated the influence of post-translational modifications and the immunoreactivity under different analytical conditions.

Here, the level of biogenic amines in some natural ciders was examined. Twenty-four samples of cider purchased from commercial sources were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection after precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde. Amine levels were variable, ranging from not detected to 23 mg/liter. The average level of total biogenic amines in ciders was 5.94 +/- 8.42 mg/liter. Putrescine, histamine, and tyramine were the prevailing amines being present in 50.0, 37.5, and 33.3% of the ciders studied; very small amounts of ethylamine and phenylethylamine were observed in only one sample. Other cider parameters were analyzed to determine whether they affect the biogenic amine content in ciders, and the results were evaluated by applying cluster analysis and principal component analysis.

17181777,"Anthocyanin concentration is an important determinant of the colour of many fruits. In apple (Malus x domestica), centuries of breeding have produced numerous varieties in which levels of anthocyanin pigment vary widely and change in response to environmental and developmental stimuli. The apple fruit cortex is usually colourless, although germplasm does exist where the cortex is highly pigmented due to the accumulation of either anthocyanins or carotenoids. From studies in a diverse array of plant species, it is apparent that anthocyanin biosynthesis is controlled at the level of transcription. Here we report the transcript levels of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in a red-fleshed apple compared with a white-fleshed cultivar. We also describe an apple MYB transcription factor, MdMYB10, that is similar in sequence to known anthocyanin regulators in other species. We further show that this transcription factor can induce anthocyanin accumulation in both heterologous and homologous systems, generating pigmented patches in transient assays in tobacco leaves and highly pigmented apple plants following stable transformation with constitutively expressed MdMYB10. Efficient induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in transient assays by MdMYB10 was dependent on the co-expression of two distinct bHLH proteins from apple, MdbHLH3 and MdbHLH33. The strong correlation between the expression of MdMYB10 and apple anthocyanin levels during fruit development suggests that this transcription factor is responsible for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple fruit; in the red-fleshed cultivar and in the skin of other varieties, there is an induction of MdMYB10 expression concurrent with colour formation during development.

Compare to other cell wall polysaccharide fractions, in Na(2)CO(3)-soluble pectic fractions of apple fruit, there were abundant rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), which branched highly in side chains due to the compositions of arabinans, galactans, arabinogalactans etc. As for cell wall polysaccharides, in 'Kinsei' apples, the decrease of pectic fractions was shown most significantly in Na(2)CO(3)-1 fraction, which was associated with a significant degradation of arabinosyl and galactosyl residues on the side chains. Further more, higher molecular mass in Na(2)CO(3)-1 pectic polysaccharides degraded and turned into ones with smaller molecular mass.

17071519,"Traditionally, the screening of unknown pesticides in food has been accomplished by GC/MS methods using conventional library-searching routines. However, many of the new polar and thermally labile pesticides are more readily and easily analysed by LC/MS methods and no searchable libraries currently exist (with the exception of some user libraries, which are limited). Therefore, there is a need for LC/MS libraries that can detect pesticides and their degradation products. This paper reports an identification scheme using a combination of LC/MS time-of-flight (accurate mass) and an Access database of 350 pesticides that are amenable to positive ion electrospray. The approach differs from conventional library searching of fragment ions. The concept consists of three parts: (1) initial screening of possible pesticides in actual market-place fruit extracts (apple and orange) using accurate mass and generating an accurate mass via an automatic ion-extraction routine, (2) searching the Access database manually for screening identification of a pesticide, and (3) identification of the suspected compound by accurate mass of at least one fragment ion and comparison of retention time with an actual standard.

ITX, a photoinitiator in UV-cured inks that can reach foods from the cartons for beverages in which they are used, was extracted from fruit juice samples with acetone/hexane (50:50) using pressurized liquid extraction. This method gave detection limits of 3, 3, and 0.01 microg/L and quantification limits of 10, 10, and 0.05 microg/L using single quadrupole, ion trap, and triple quadrupole, respectively. Five replicate fortifications of different fruit juices at the quantification limit gave recoveries oscillating between 68 and 72% with CV varying between 14 and 18%. This is the first report of a positive mass spectrometric identification and quantification of ITX in fruit juice samples packed in TetraPack. The sensitivity and specificity of the LC-MS/MS analysis using the triple quadrupole enables it to be the method of choice for risk assessment and monitoring.

16931180,"An automated online gel permeation chromatography-gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GPC-GC/MS) was developed for the rapid determination of residual pesticides in agricultural products. Pesticides were extracted from homogenized food samples with acetonitrile and decontaminated via the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) technique, using a primary secondary amine as sorbent prior to GPC-GC/MS analysis. A slightly modified preparation method and automated GPC step proved useful in minimizing matrix interference. To evaluate the performance of the system, 97 target pesticides were spiked at a concentration of 0.1mg/kg into a range of food types, including potato, cabbage, carrot, apple, orange, cucumber, and rice. A low flow rate of 0.1 mL/min in GPC resulted in a 40-fold reduction in solvent consumption compared with conventional GPC column applications. The combination of MSPD technique and GPC-GC/MS for the analysis of the 97 pesticides can be accomplished within 90 min. Most pesticides were recovered in the range of 70-120%, with relative standard deviation generally less than 10%.

The purpose of this work was to establish a real-time PCR method, which can detect and quantify apple pathogenic and toxigenic Alternaria. An AM-toxin I primer set, which could recognize Alternaria DNA only, was designed by using primers complementary to the AM-toxin I gene. The method could detect small amounts of DNA (4 pg) and still obtain a large dynamic range (4 decades) without interference from apple material. Eight Alternaria isolates were analyzed for the presence of AM-toxin I gene and their production of secondary metabolites. Then analyses showed that all eight isolates contained the AM toxin gene and were able to produce the plant pathogenic tentoxin in addition to AM toxin I. The analyses also showed the production of tenuazonic acid, alternariols, Altenuene, altenusin and/or altertoxin I in pure culture. Analyses of inoculated apples showed that both the AM-toxin gene and alternariol monomethyl ether could be detected.

This study investigated the use of major carbohydrate (fructose, glucose and sucrose), polyol (sorbitol), proline, and phenolic profiles as indicators of pear adulteration of apple juice (PAAJ). For this work, a total of 105 authentic apple juice samples from 13 countries and 27 authentic pear juice samples from 5 countries were analyzed. Because the major carbohydrate ranges for these juices showed significant overlap their use as markers for PAAJ detection would be very limited. It was found that sorbitol and proline means for apple and pear were significantly different; however, their broad natural ranges would afford PAAJ at levels up to 30% without detection. In addition, careful selection of the pear juice used as the adulterant would further limit the usefulness of these markers for PAAJ detection. Arbutin was conclusively identified as a marker for pear juice on the basis of its presence in all 27 authentic pear samples and its absence (<0.5 microg/mL) in all 105 apple juice samples analyzed in this study. The application of the developed HPLC-PDA method for arbutin analysis to detect PAAJ at levels as low as 2% (v/v) was demonstrated. A confirmation method for the presence of arbutin in pure pear juice and apple adulterated with pear juice was introduced on the basis of the hydrolysis of arbutin to hydroquinone employing beta-glucosidase, with reactant and product monitoring by HPLC-PDA.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001104', 'D001628', 'D002241', 'D002851', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D006868', 'D006873', 'D027845', 'D011392', 'D031989', 'D013012']","['Arbutin', 'Beverages', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Hydrolysis', 'Hydroquinones', 'Malus', 'Proline', 'Pyrus', 'Sorbitol']","Adulteration of apple with pear juice: emphasis on major carbohydrates, proline, and arbutin.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16787040,2006

16718573,"Plants release volatile chemicals into their surrounding air space that can affect the physiology of neighboring plants and influence the behavior of insects. In studying these interactions, it is desirable to collect volatiles from plants that have not been excised and are growing under as natural conditions as possible. We compared a vessel of borosilicate glass and Nylon-6 or polyester [poly(ethyleneterephthalate) or PET] cooking bags for enclosing plants during collection of volatiles. A push-pull airflow system was used, and volatiles were trapped on Tenax TA and analyzed by gas chromatography after thermal desorption. Low levels of impurities were found for the glass vessel and polyester bags. Nylon bags contained higher levels and more impurities. Recoveries of standards of 10 plant volatiles were measured in static and dynamic systems. In a static air system, there was good recovery only from the glass vessel. In a dynamic system, there was generally good recovery from both the glass vessel and polyester bags. Recoveries of alpha-pinene and (Z)-jasmone were poor throughout. The former was shown to have a very low breakthrough volume on the Tenax TA adsorbent, and the latter may be strongly adsorbed on glass. All three materials were essentially transparent in the IR and visible (photosynthetic) range but with significantly different absorptions in the UV range. In a simulated dynamic entrainment in full sunlight, internal vessel temperatures were higher than ambient by up to 9.5 degrees C in the glass vessel and 7.5 degrees C in the polyester bag. Lower increases in temperature relative to ambient (<1 degrees C) were recorded when entrainments were conducted in the shade. In a field trial, the profiles of volatiles collected from an apple tree infested with rosy apple aphid using a glass vessel and a polyester bag were similar.

The observed emission, collected by an external detector and corrected by its spectral response, is still distorted by light reabsorption processes taking place in the fruit skin and differs appreciably from the true spectral distribution of fluorescence emerging from chlorophyll molecules in the biological tissue. Reabsorption processes particularly affect the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 680 nm and at 730 nm. A model to obtain the correct spectral distribution of the emission, from the experimental fluorescence recorded at a fluorometer detector and corrected for the detector spectral sensitivity, is developed in the present work. Measurements of the whole fruit reflectance, the peel transmittance and the flesh reflectance allow the calculation of the reabsorption-corrected spectra. The model is validated by comparing the corrected emission spectra with that obtained for a thin layer of apple-peel-chloroplasts, where no reabsorption takes place.

Limits of detection are 80 ng of SEB for MS and 100 ng for full scan MS/MS, using a tryptic fragment as the analytical target. Lower detection limits can be obtained using selected ion monitoring and multiple reaction monitoring.

16448197,"The impact of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on the synthesis and retention of flavonoid compounds during storage and ripening of red Delicious (Malus x domestica Borkh.) apples was investigated. Numerous anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, and a hydroxycinnamic acid from three different fruit harvest maturities were monitored after a 120 day storage and 1 week shelf life period using high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detector analysis. The total flavonoid concentration was 5% greater in fruit treated with 1-MCP, whereas chlorogenic acid levels were 24% lower. All compounds analyzed increased in concentration during fruit harvest; however, the anthocyanins generally declined after storage, while chlorogenic acid levels increased. 1-MCP treatment resulted in the retention of anthocyanins in the latter stages of storage but did not affect the flavonols and flavan-3-ols. Chlorogenic acid biosynthesis from early and optimal fruit harvest maturities was greatly inhibited by 1-MCP during storage and the 1 week shelf life period. However, 1-MCP did not affect chlorogenic acid concentrations in late-harvested fruit. Results suggest that 1-MCP may inhibit the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and subsequent biosynthesis of flavonoid compounds.

This was achieved by a combination of MALDI-MS/MS de novo sequencing of double-derivatized peptides and indel-tolerant searching against local protein databases built on both EST and full-length nucleotide sequences. The amino acid sequence of a strawberry allergen, homologous to the well-known major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1, was partially determined. This strawberry allergen, named Fra a 1 according to the nomenclature for allergen proteins, showed sequence identity of 54 and 77%, respectively, with corresponding allergens from birch and apple. Differential expression, as evaluated by 2-D DIGE, occurred in 10% of protein spots when red strawberries were compared to a colorless (white) strawberry mutant. White strawberries, known to be tolerated by individuals affected by allergy, were found to be virtually free from the strawberry allergen.

For this reason, XOD inhibitor, which effectively suppresses this enzyme, plays an important role in the inhibition of many diseases related to reactive oxygen species (ROS). In order to screen XOD inhibitors rapidly and conveniently, a novel assay using flow injection analysis (FIA) was proposed in the present investigation. To optimize the practical FIA system, we studied the effect of the reagent concentrations and the flow condition on the enzymatic reaction, and then selected the optimum condition as follows: 200-mU/ml XOD concentration, 0.5-mM xanthine concentration, 0.5-ml/min flow rate, and 2-m mixing coil length. Under this condition, a typical XOD inhibitor quercetin was determined in the concentration range 0.1 - 1.5 mM at a sampling frequency of 10 samples/h. Using the optimized FIA method, we determined the XOD inhibitory activity of some food samples: onions, apples and teas, which are the high sources of flavonoids known as the potential XOD inhibitors. Among these samples, tea leaves showed the highest activity, the second was onions and the lowest was apples.

The linearity of the standard curve produced for the kit-assembled standard solutions (slope = -0.3829) agreed with that of the curve produced for the self-made standard solutions (slope = -0.3619). The sensitivity (I50 value) and the limit of detection for the kit were 0.23 and 0.033 ng/g, respectively.

Given the anionic character of ethephon, the use of ion-pairing liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS, triple quadrupole) allowed its direct determination in these matrices avoiding a derivatisation step and favouring the automation of the method. Samples were extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane/aqueous formic acid (pH 3) (1:1). Then, tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBA) was added as an ion-pairing reagent, and an aliquot of the aqueous extract was directly injected into the LC/MS/MS system. Quantification was performed with matrix-matched standards prepared from blank sample extracts. MS/MS measurements were made in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, using the most sensitive transition (m/z 107 > 79) for quantification, and up to four additional transitions for confirmation. Quantitative recoveries were obtained for all matrices (between 83% and 96%) at two concentration levels tested (0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg), with relative standard deviations lower than 9% in all cases. The addition of TBA directly into the sample extract contained in the injection vial was found sufficient to obtain satisfactory LC retention for the analyte. Under these conditions, the absence of ion-pairing reagent in the mobile phase minimised the ionisation suppression for ethephon in the MS source, leading to an increase in the sensitivity of the method and reaching limits of detection of 0.02 mg/kg for all matrices investigated.

The native fluorescence signal of diphenylamine retained on the solid support (C18 silica gel) was used for its determination (lambda(exc)/lambda(em) 291/372 nm). The sample treatment consists of a liquid-liquid extraction with acetonitrile followed by a cleanup step using primary-secondary amines. The use of a continuous flow assembly implementing multicommutation, based on a set of three-way solenoid valves controlled by appropriate software, provides the automatic control of sample, carrier, and eluting solution with remarkable advantages in relation to conventional flow injection approaches.

16361796,"Aroma volatiles from apple (Malus domestica Borkh. var. Starkrimson) fruit at different stages of maturity were collected by solid adsorbent-Tenax-GC and determined by thermodesorption and GC-MS. Production of propyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl 2-methyl-butanoate and total ester volatiles and changes in concentration of the precursors of aroma biosynthsis--free amino acids and fatty acids and activities of lipoxygenases (LOX) and alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT) in apple fruits during ripening were studied. The results showed that propyl acetate and total esters were very low when the endogenous ethylene formation of the fruit was very low. At the stage of the increase in ethylene production, the rate of formation of propyl acetate and total esters increased. Butyl acetate appeared at the beginning of ethylene rise and increased thereafter. Ethyl 2-methyl-butanoate was produced at the beginning of climacteric stage and then increased sharply (Figs.1). These facts suggest that the aroma production is closely related to ethylene production. Among the 14 free amino acids detected in fruit, isoleucine which is considered to be the biosynthetic precursor of some branched chain esters showed a great increase during fruit ripening while the others decreased or remained stable (Table 1). The accumulation of isoleucine suggested that isoleucine supply in fruit may not limit the biosynthesis of esters with branched chain alkyl groups. Concentrations of free fatty acids such as palmitic, linolenic, oleic, linoleic, stearic acids increased before the increase of aroma production, decreased with the increase of aroma production and showed an increase at postclimacteric stages (Fig.2). LOX activity increased at climacteric stages and declined rapidly thereafter. AAT activity increased sharply at the early stage of fruit maturity when the aroma was very low and remained at a stable high level during fruit ripening (Fig.3) indicating that the AAT activity is not the limiting factor for aroma formation in apple fruit.",Zhi wu sheng li yu fen zi sheng wu xue xue bao = Journal of plant physiology and molecular biology,"['D000085', 'D000596', 'D005030', 'D005227', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D008084', 'D027845', 'D011506', 'D014835']","['Acetates', 'Amino Acids', 'Ethylenes', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Lipoxygenase', 'Malus', 'Proteins', 'Volatilization']",[Changes in amino acid and fatty acid contents as well as activity of some related enzymes in apple fruit during aroma production].,"['Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000201', 'Q000378', None]","['chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'enzymology', None, 'metabolism', 'enzymology', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16361796,2009

16277414,"Spiking of tomato and apple fruits with parathion at different levels of about 1-4 mg/kg irradiation and under simulated sunlight conditions resulted in nearly complete photodegradation within 13 h, but extractable parathion degradation products could not be found in any case. However, after irradiation of an unrealistically spiked apple (134 mg/kg) different photoproducts including aminoparathion (AP) were detectable by HPLC, proving that the hitherto postulated photochemistry of parathion indeed takes place in the fruit cuticle environment. Besides the photoreduction pathway it was shown for the first time that AP is also easily formed by reduction of the primary photoproduct nitrosoparathion with thiols (cysteine, glutathione), while ascorbic acid only leaves hydroxylaminoparathion. In the presence of polyphenols, AP was effectively bound to quinone intermediates formed by both silver oxide and polyphenol oxidases. For pyrocatechol, a disubstituted o-quinone derivative could be isolated as a dark red addition product and structurally be elucidated. However, in the presence of caffeic acid, catechol, naringin, and quercetin, respectively, insoluble dark colored polymers precipitated within 48 h, while in the supernatants AP was not detectable any more. Polymer-bound and nonextractable AP was proven by transesterification with sodium ethoxide releasing O,O,O-triethyl thiophosphate which was determined by GC. Additionally, AP itself was a substrate for polyphenol oxidases, resulting in a quinone imine intermediate which in turn reacted with excessive AP yielding deep red colored di- and trimerization products.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D004156', 'D002851', 'D005419', 'D005638', 'D007306', 'D018551', 'D027845', 'D010278', 'D010636', 'D010777', 'D059808']","['Catechol Oxidase', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flavonoids', 'Fruit', 'Insecticides', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Malus', 'Parathion', 'Phenols', 'Photochemistry', 'Polyphenols']",Aminoparathion: a highly reactive metabolite of parathion. 1.

It is well known that plant ingredients such as polyphenols and flavonoids show anticarcinogenic effects both in vitro and in animal experiments, and may thus reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in man. The aim of the study was to determine the amount of polyphenols reaching the colon after oral intake of apple juice. After consumption of a polyphenol-free diet 11 healthy ileostomy volunteers drank 1 L of a polyphenol-rich cloudy apple juice. Ileostomy effluent was collected immediately before and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after consumption of apple juice. A broad spectrum of polyphenols was identified using HPLC-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) as well as HPLC-ESI-MS/MS; quantitation was performed with HPLC-DAD. Most of the orally administered apple polyphenols were absorbed from or metabolized in the small intestine. Between 0 and 33% of the oral dose was recovered in the ileostomy bags with a maximum of excretion after 2 h. Phloretin glucuronide as product of polyphenol metabolism was detected in the ileostomy effluent. The present results show that most of the apple juice polyphenols are absorbed in the small intestine.

The combination of high sensitivity full-scan spectra incorporating accurate mass measurements (routinely better than 2 ppm accuracy) of the protonated molecules with the evidence from resolved isotopic clusters provides the ability to obtain a reduced number of possible elemental compositions (typically 1-2). Databases were then used to find the identity of the suspected species using the elemental composition as a searching criterion. The accurate mass and the generated elemental composition of characteristic fragment ions of the suspected species provide further evidence for the proposed species. With this approach we have identified the following chlorinated pesticides in different market-purchased fruit and vegetable extracts: Chlorotoluron (tomato), iprodione (apple), and procymidone (grapes). Finally, the confirmation and quantitation of these suspected species were successfully accomplished with standards.

Fuji flesh contains substantial levels of 2-methyl butyl acetate (fruity banana-like odor), while the flesh of cv. Granny Smith apples lacks this compound. Granny Smith apples accumulate mainly hexyl acetate (apple-pear odor) in their peel.

Differential substrate specificities of the in vitro acetyl-CoA:alcohol acetyl transferase (AAT) activities were also detected among cultivars. In Granny Smith apples, the AAT activity was detected only in the peel, and its specificity was almost exclusively restricted to hexanol and cis-3-hexenol. In Fuji apples, the AAT activity was detected in both peel and flesh and apparently accepted a broader range of alcohols as substrates than the Granny Smith enzyme activity.

Cashew nut shell liquid was used for a basic fractionation of the alkyl phenol classes and the individual anacardic acids, major cardanols and cardols were purified to homogeneity from these fractions by semi-preparative HPLC and definitively identified by nano-ESI-MS-MS, GC-MS and NMR analyses. The hexane extracts (10 mg/ml) of all cashew products tested plus CNSL, displayed significant antioxidant capacity. Cashew nut shell liquid was the more efficient (inhibition=100%) followed by the hexane extract of cashew fibre (94%) and apple (53%). The antioxidant capacity correlated significantly (P<0.05) with the concentration of alkyl phenols in the extracts. A mixture of anacardic acids (10.0 mg/ml) showed the higher antioxidant capacity (IC50=0.60 mM) compared to cardols and cardanols (IC50>4.0 mM).

16085185,"Dietary inorganic nitrate is secreted in saliva and reduced to nitrite by bacterial flora. At the acidic pH of the stomach nitrite is present as nitrous acid in equilibrium with nitric oxide (*NO), and other nitrogen oxides with nitrating and nitrosating activity. *NO in the stomach exerts several beneficial effects, but nitrosating/nitrating species have been implicated as a possible cause of epithelial neoplasia at the gastroesophageal junction. We investigated the effects of apple extracts on *NO release by human saliva at pH 2. A water extract obtained from apple homogenate increased *NO release caused by acidification of saliva. Data show that polyphenols were responsible for this activity, with chlorogenic acid and (+)-catechin the most active and concentrated species. However, ferulic acid, a hydroxycinnamic acid with only one aromatic hydroxyl group, did not increase *NO release. Fructose, the most representative sugar in apples, was also inactive. Interestingly, ascorbic acid in saliva induced a SCN(-)-enhanced burst of *NO but, unlike apple, the release was transient. The simultaneous addition of ascorbic acid and apple extract caused a burst of *NO followed by the increased steady-state level characteristic of saliva containing apple extract. Chlorogenic acid and (+)-catechin, but not ferulic acid, formed o-semiquinone radicals and nitrated polyphenols, suggesting the scavenging of *NO(2) by o-semiquinones. Our results propose that some apple polyphenols not only inhibit nitrosation/nitration but also promote *NO bio-availabilty at the gastric level, a previously unappreciated function.",Free radical biology & medicine,"['D000975', 'D001205', 'D002396', 'D003373', 'D004563', 'D004578', 'D005419', 'D005609', 'D005753', 'D006801', 'D006863', 'D027845', 'D013058', 'D008956', 'D009566', 'D009569', 'D009573', 'D010636', 'D059808', 'D012463', 'D013053', 'D013696', 'D013997', 'D015032']","['Antioxidants', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Catechols', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Flavonoids', 'Free Radicals', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Malus', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Models, Chemical', 'Nitrates', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitrites', 'Phenols', 'Polyphenols', 'Saliva', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Zinc']",Apples increase nitric oxide production by human saliva at the acidic pH of the stomach: a new biological function for polyphenols with a catechol group?,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16085185,2005

It is based on high-performance liquid chromatography with an automatic precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldehyde and 3-mercaptopropionic acid and diode array detection. The method was applied to monitor the amino acids during second fermentation of sparkling ciders. This paper reports the influence of yeast strains and aging time on the amino acid composition of sparkling ciders. The application of principal component analysis enables the ciders to be differentiated on the basis of the two factors considered (yeast strain and aging time). The first principal component, which accounts for 58% of the total variance, achieved the separation according to aging time with serine, glycine, alanine, valine, ornithine, leucine, and lysine as the most important variables.

The analytical performance of the method was evaluated for different types of fruit and vegetables: pepper, broccoli, tomato, orange, lemon, apple and melon. The accurate mass measurements were compared in different matrices at significantly different concentration levels (from 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg) obtaining accuracy errors lower than 2 ppm, which is well within the accepted limits for elemental confirmation. Linearity of response over two orders of magnitude was demonstrated (r > 0.99). Matrix effects resulting in suppression or enhancement of the response were frequently observed, most notably in broccoli and citrus. Instrumental limits of detection (LOD) were between 0.0005 and 0.03 mg/kg depending on the commodity and pesticide studied, all being within European Union regulations for food monitoring program. Finally, the methodology was applied to the analysis of two samples from an inter-laboratory exercise. The high degree of confirmation for target pesticides by accurate mass measurements demonstrated the applicability of the method in routine analysis.

However, some PPIs can block the tube. The aim of this study was to compare the behaviour of three PPIs (omeprazole, lanzoprazole and esomeprazole) during the transit of the granules through the tube and to optimise their modes of administration. For each IPP, the experiment was designed to study the influence of four variables: the tube material (silicone or polyurethane), the solvent used to dilute the granules (water or apple juice), the mode of administration (in two or three doses) and the rinse volume (10 or 20 ml). We counted the granules before transit and at the tube outlet, and assayed the active drug ingredient by UV spectrometry. The assay showed complete transit of esomeprazole through the tube, but average losses of omeprazole and lanzoprazole of 39 and 33%, respectively, were observed. No significant improvement was obtained by the variables 'diluent' and 'mode of administration'. The variable 'rinse' had a significant influence. For lanzoprazole, a polyurethane tube allowed recovery of on average 86% of the active ingredient. Esomeprazole is thus the choice PPI for the treatment of patients by nasogastric tube. Using a polyurethane tube and a rinse volume of 20 ml, the administration of lanzoprazole by tube can be considered.

Our results showed that the concentration of polyphenolics varied among the apple cultivars, with Pacific Queen containing 2.7 times the amount of polyphenolics found in Cox's Orange. Furthermore, there were significant differences in polyphenolic concentrations in fruit from different regions for some cultivars but not for others. We also measured the polyphenolic concentrations in apple skin and flesh and found that on average 46% of the polyphenolics in whole apples were in the skin.

15678938,"A sensitive and selective method for quantification and confirmation of patulin in apple juice by GC/MS was developed. By this method, patulin was precisely determined and confirmed down to the level of 1 and 5 microg/kg in samples, respectively. Patulin was extracted with ethyl acetate from a sample and then hexane was added to the concentrated extract solution. Significant amounts of insoluble impurities were filtered off, followed by further clean-up by solid-phase extraction with combined silica gel and Florisil cartridges. The filtration step in a low-polarity condition was very effective to remove the impurities in the sample extract solution. The eluate from the cartridges was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and patulin was determined and confirmed by GC/MS after derivatization with 2.5% N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide ethyl acetate solution.

15675789,"Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by mainly Penicillium species, for example, P. expansum, and Aspergillus species. There are several reports of patulin contamination in apple juice. Last year, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan set the maximum allowable level of patulin in apple juice at 50 ppb and decided that the measurement of patulin levels in apple juice products should be conducted. To this end, a simple, accurate, and selective analytical method for the detection of patulin at levels lower than 5 ppb, the detection limit, is desired. This paper reports the development of an analytical method that employs solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS). When MS measurements were conducted with the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, the pseudomolecular ions at m/z 153 and 156 were used to monitor patulin and (13)C(3)-labeled patulin, respectively. The detection limit (S/N = 3) and the quantification limit (S/N = 10) of patulin at injection levels into LC-MS were 12.5 and 25 pg, respectively. However, when the actual sample was applied for the analysis based on the developed method including the sample preparation, the detection limit (S/N = 3) and quantification limit (S/N = 10) were 2.5 and 5 pg in sample, respectively. The calibration curve obtained for concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 ppb showed good linearity with a coefficient of determination (r (2)) of 0.999. In addition, the recovery was >95% when an internal standard was used. The method was applied to the analysis of 76 apple juice samples from Japan, and as a result, patulin levels ranging from <1.0 to 45 ppb (detection frequency = 15/76) were detected. In this study, it was found that patulin was a greater contaminant in concentration/reduction than in ""not from concentrate"" apple juice.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001628', 'D002851', 'D005638', 'D027845', 'D010365', 'D021241']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fruit', 'Malus', 'Patulin', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Development of liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry for the determination of patulin in apple juice: investigation of its contamination levels in Japan.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15675789,2005

The estimated contribution of major phenolics and vitamin C to total anitoxidant capacity of 100 g fresh Empire apples is as follows: quercetin (60.05 VCEAC) > chlorogenic acid (12.32) > phloretin (7.41) > procyanidin B2 (7.22) > vitamin C (6.61) > epicatechin (5.10) in superoxide radical scavenging assay.

Apple extracts showed the protective effects against the inhibition of GJIC by H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner. Quercetin exerted the strongest protective effects among major antioxidants in apples on H2O2-induced inhibition of GJIC, following epicatechin, procyanidin B2, and vitamin C, while chlorogenic acid and phloretin had no effects.

Without the addition of ascorbic acid, oxidation substantially decreased chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and procyanidin B2 contents due to enzymatic browning. The content of chlorogenic acid as the major polyphenolic compound was also influenced by the composition of pectolytic enzyme preparations because the presence of secondary protease activity resulted in a rise of chlorogenic acid.

A water-soluble free radical initiator, 2,2'-azobis(amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, was used at physiological temperature (37 degrees C) to generate peroxyl radicals to catalyze lipid oxidation of LDL isolated from human plasma samples. Headspace hexanal, a major decomposition product of LDL oxidation, was measured by a headspace gas chromatograph as an indicator of antioxidant capacity of different concentrations of pure antioxidants (vitamins C and E) and the extracts of natural products (fresh apple phytochemical extracts). All vitamin C and E and apple extract concentrations tested resulted in increasing partial suppression and delay of LDL oxidation. On the basis of the median effective dose (EC(50)) calculated for each compound or extract tested, the LOMAC value of 100 g of apple against LDL oxidation was equivalent to 1470 mg of vitamin E or to 402 mg of vitamin C. This study shows that the LOMAC assay can be routinely used to analyze or screen antioxidants or phytochemical extracts against LDL oxidation to prevent cardiovascular disease.

Up to 20 compounds including catechin, epicatechin, B2 procyanidin, hydroxycinnamates, flavonols, anthocyanins, and dihydrochalcones were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and LC-MS. Total polyphenol content was independently measured with an optimized Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The mean content of total polyphenols lay between 66.2 and 211.9 mg/100 g of FW depending on the variety. With chromatographic analysis, it was possible to explain the whole amount of total polyphenols measured by the FC assay.

15479018,"Apple is among the most consumed fruits worldwide. It is available on the market for the whole year being a major source of dietary polyphenols. Several studies suggested that apple polyphenols could play a role in prevention of degenarative diseases. The action of these compounds has been partially ascribed to their antioxidative ability, and fruit antioxidants profile is influenced by apple variety and by the postharvest storage. In this work, the polyphenols composition of the flesh of four apple varieties cultivated in southern Italy were investigated by HPLC, and a flow injection MS/MS procedure to quantify cholorogenic acid and catechins was set up. Phenolic composition and the radical scavenging activity were monitored during a postharvest storage of four months. The quantification by flow injection procedure gives results comparable to those obtained by HPLC, and the increase of the antioxidant activity during storage correlated with an increase of the concentration of catechin and phloridzin. This trend is particularly evident for the variety ""Annurca"" which is a typical product cultivated in the area around Naples.

The study also showed that the addition of saliva influenced the extraction of volatile compounds, but this effect was different from one compound to another. To verify that the headspace extracts presented a global odor representativeness of fresh apple under these conditions of extraction, eight assessors compared the odor of extracts with fresh fruit odor for three different cultivars.

15264900,"The relationship between phenolic composition and radical scavenging activity of apple peel and pulp was investigated in fruit produced according to both organic and integrated agricultural methods. Apple tissue extracts were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography separation, which showed that as compared with pulps, peels are richer in almost all of the quantified phenolics. Flavonols, flavanols, procyanidins, dihydrochalcones, and hydroxycinnamates were the identified phenolic classes in peel tissue, and the most abundant compounds were epicatechin, procyanidin B2, and phloridzin. Pulps were poorer in phytochemicals. Their major phenolics were procyanidins and hydroxycinnamates. Flavonols in amounts <20 mg kg(-1) fresh weight (fw) were also found. In both peels and pulps, integrated production samples were richer in polyphenols. Among the 14 compounds identified, only phloridzin had a tendency to appear higher in organic peels. The total antioxidant capacities (TAC) of extracts were evaluated using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical assay and were expressed as Trolox equivalents. Integrated peels gave the highest TAC (18.56 mM kg(-1) fw), followed by organic peels (TAC = 14.96), integrated pulps (TAC = 7.12), and organic pulps (TAC = 6.28). In peels, the top contributors to the antioxidant activity were found to be flavonols, flavanols, and procyanidins, which accounted for about 90% of the total calculated activity whereas in pulps, the TAC was primarily derived from flavanols (monomers and polymers) together with hydroxycinnamates.

Carbamate pesticides are known to be used on a broad spectrum of crops, including orchard and vine crops such as apples and grapes. Concern over potential exposure to these acutely toxic pesticides by infants and young children has increased in the last decade. Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection was used to determine the concentrations of seven N-methyl carbamates and three transformation products in domestic and imported apple and grape juices collected across Canada. Carbaryl was the most frequently (58.6%) detected N-methyl carbamate in juice samples studied. It was observed more frequently in grape juices than in apple or mixed juices. Oxamyl and methomyl were detected in apple juice samples, although they were below detection limits in all grape and mixed juice samples analysed. Maximum levels of carbaryl, methomyl and oxamyl were 93, 6.7 and 4.6 ng ml(-1), respectively. All other analytes were not present in any juice sample at concentrations above the method detection limit (0.3 ng ml(-1)).

15156042,"The flavonoids, constituting one of the most numerous and widespread groups of natural plant constituents, are important to humans not only because they contribute to plant colors but also because many members are physiologically active. These low-molecular-weight substances, found in all vascular plants, are phenylbenzopyrones. Over 4000 structures have been identified in plant sources, and they are categorized into several groups. Primarily recognized as pigments responsible for the autumnal burst of hues and the many shades of yellow, orange, and red in flowers and food, the flavonoids are found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, stems, flowers, and leaves as well as tea and wine and are important constituents of the human diet. They are prominent components of citrus fruits and other food sources. Flavonols (quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol) and flavones (apigenin and luteolin) are the most common phenolics in plant-based foods. Quercetin is also a predominant component of onions, apples, and berries. Such flavanones as naringin are typically present in citrus fruit, and flavanols, particularly catechin, are present as catechin gallate in such beverages as green or black tea and wine. Some major sources of flavonoids are outlined in Table 1. The daily intake of flavonoids in humans has been estimated to be approx 25 mg/d, a quantity that could provide pharmacologically significant concentrations in body fluids and tissues, assuming good absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Biological activity of flavonoids was first suggested by Szent-Gÿorgyi 1938, who reported that citrus peel flavonoids were effective in preventing the capillary bleeding and fragility associated with scurvy. The broad spectrum of biological activity within the group and the multiplicity of actions displayed by a certain individual members make the flavonoids one of the most promising classes of biologically active compounds.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","['D000890', 'D001118', 'D019659', 'D002854', 'D004926', 'D005419', 'D007202', 'D008826', 'D008958', 'D015394', 'D008517', 'D012997']","['Anti-Infective Agents', 'Argentina', 'Asteraceae', 'Chromatography, Paper', 'Escherichia coli', 'Flavonoids', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phytotherapy', 'Solvents']",Flavonoids from Argentine Tagetes (Asteraceae) with antimicrobial activity.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000187', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'drug effects', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15156042,2004

Leaves were treated with: 1. solution of 0.1% JA-Me in 0.05% Triton X-100 (by spraying); 2. beta-glucosidase dissolved in 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 6 (by petiole); 3. 0.05% solution of the Triton X-100 (by spraying); 4. 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 6 (by petiole); 5. non-treated leaves. In the no-choice test, application of JA-Me on leaves of apple trees caused reducing of number of eggs laid up during three days of the experiment. In the choice test, which was carried out for determination of non-preference mechanism of resistance, there was not significant differences between number of mites on leaves treated with JA-Me compared to leaves treated with beta-glucosidase, and to non-treated leaves after 24 hours from solutions application. However, at the same experiment, females of T. urticae laid the least number of eggs on leaves treated with JA-Me. Analysis conducted using liquid chromatography method, revealed higher level of phenolic compounds on leaves treated with JA-Me compared to check and leaves treated with beta-glucosidase.

The limit of detection for the kit (0.1 or 0.5 ng/mL) was determined. The working range (1-39 ng/mL) experimentally calculated on the basis of a criterion, which is determined as the range from I(20) to I(80), was comparable to that established by the manufacturer (1-50 ng/mL). The linearity of the standard curve based on the kit-assembled standard solutions agreed with the one based on the self-made standard solutions. Specificity studies indicate that the imidacloprid monoclonal antibody can readily distinguish the target compound from other structurally related neonicotinoid analogues and some metabolites, with the exception of clothianidin, the cross-reactivity of which was approximately 12%. To extract imidacloprid from an agricultural sample (apple) as simply and rapidly as possible, some extraction methods were examined. Consequently, the extraction method with hand-shaking for 5 min was the best among the examined methods. For the analysis of imidacloprid in apple samples, it was extracted directly with methanol and the extracts were diluted 10-fold (100-fold in the well) with water prior to ELISA analysis.

Proprietary emulsifiable concentrates were diluted and added to each of 90 glass Petri dishes for each pesticide and were left overnight to dry. Petri dishes were placed in 18 air-tight containers (9 for each pesticide) in which were created environments with relative humidity (RH) of 60, 82, and 96%. The containers were stored at 0, 20, and 40 degrees C. From the experimental results best fit curves, kinetic equations, rate constants, and half-lives were calculated. Half-lives of azinphos methyl for the RH studied were, from 124 to 267 days at 0 degrees C, from 89 to 231 days at 20 degrees C, and from 25 to 71 days at 40 degrees C. Corresponding half-lives for parathion methyl were from 48 to 57 days at 0 degrees C, from 9.2 to 10.5 days at 20 degrees C and from 1.3 to 1.5 days at 40 degrees C. The results were correlated with relevant results from the decomposition of the same or similar pesticides on apples both, on the trees and during refrigerated storage. These correlations are suggesting that biological factors strongly affected the decomposition rate of azinphos methyl.

15084107,"Health risk associated with dietary arsenic intake may be different for infants and adults. Seafood is the main contributor to arsenic intake for adults while terrestrial-based food is the primary source for infants. Processed infant food products such as rice-based cereals, mixed rice/formula cereals, milk-based infant formula, applesauce and puree of peaches, pears, carrots, sweet potatoes, green beans, and squash were evaluated for total and speciated arsenic content. Arsenic concentrations found in rice-based cereals (63-320 ng/g dry weight) were similar to those reported for raw rice. Results for the analysis of powdered infant formula by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) indicated a narrow and low arsenic concentration range (12 to 17 ng/g). Arsenic content in puree infant food products, including rice cereals, fruits, and vegetables, varies from <1 to 24 ng/g wet weight. Sample treatment with trifluoroacetic acid at 100 degrees C were an efficient and mild method for extraction of arsenic species present in different food matrixes as compared to alternative methods that included sonication and accelerated solvent extraction. Extraction recoveries from 94 to 128% were obtained when the summation of species was compared to total arsenic. The ion chromatography (IC)-ICP-MS method selected for arsenic speciation allowed for the quantitative determination of inorganic arsenic [As(III) + As(V)], dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and methylarsonic acid (MMA). Inorganic arsenic and DMA are the main species found in rice-based and mixed rice/formula cereals, although traces of MMA were also detected. Inorganic arsenic was present in freeze-dried sweet potatoes, carrots, green beans, and peaches. MMA and DMA were not detected in these samples.

However, there is almost no data about its absorption and metabolism. Therefore, the enrichment of PAT in the tissue of perfused rat stomachs after luminal application and its vascular appearance was quantified by stable isotope dilution assays. After application of juices enriched with PAT at concentrations of 350 and 3.5 mg/l, respectively, the mycotoxin appeared almost instantly in the perfusate. Twenty-six to twenty-nine percent of PAT were removed from the gastric lumen over 55 min. From this quantity, 17% and 2% were transferred into vascular circulation and 3% and 0.06% were detectable in gastric tissue for the high and the low PAT dose, respectively. The disappearance of 8400 microg and 700 microg PAT, respectively, could be attributed in part to its reaction with intracellular glutathione (GSH). Regarding the GSH content in the tissue, a decrease of 87% compared to that of control stomachs was observed for the high PAT dose, whereas in the case of the low PAT dose no significant GSH degradation occurred.

15036012,"Although both non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and resistant starches (RS) are included in current definitions of dietary fibre, our previous work has suggested fundamental differences in the way in which these two classes of material affect the disposition and absorption of a dietary carcinogen. The present studies explore whether different effects on carcinogen metabolism could play a role in the contrasting patterns seen previously. Groups of female Wistar rats were pre-fed for 4 weeks one of five types of defined diet (AIN-76). The control diet contained 35% maize starch and no dietary fibre. The RS-containing diets had all the maize starch substituted with either Hi-maize or potato starch. In the NSP-containing diets, 10% of the maize starch was substituted with dietary fibre in the form of either lignified plant cell walls (wheat straw) or soluble dietary fibre (apple pectin). Pre-fed rats were gavaged with the food carcinogen, [2-14C] 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), and plasma and urinary metabolites characterized using HPLC at various time intervals after administration. After 4 h gavage, plasma from rats on both RS-containing diets contained significantly higher levels of intact IQ and lower levels of the major metabolites, IQ-5-O-glucuronide and IQ-5-sulfate, as compared with plasma from the negative control group at this time. In contrast, plasma from animals on the NSP-containing wheat straw diet (and to a lesser extent the apple pectin diet) showed significantly lower levels of intact IQ, and significantly higher levels of the two major metabolites, as compared with those from the control rats. These different metabolite profiles were also reflected in different urinary excretion profiles. Urine from rats pre-fed RS-containing diets revealed significantly slower metabolite excretion as compared with urine from rats that had been given the NSP-containing diets. Western blotting methodologies also profiled differences between the effects of these two types of dietary fibre in the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. We conclude that changes in activity and expression of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes could play a role in the contrasting effects of these two types of dietary fibre on carcinogen uptake and disposition.","Journal of chromatography.

14650613,"In recent years, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) has attained increasing attention for its outstanding separation potential and capability to solve demanding analytical tasks. Trace level analysis of pesticides residues in complex food matrices represents such a demanding task. For some commodities, such as baby food, the requirements on method detection limits are very strict and the unambiguous confirmation of the pesticide presence based on mass spectrometric detection is required. In this work, GC x GC coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) has been evaluated for the determination of pesticides residues in fruit samples. Twenty modern pesticides with a broad range of physico-chemical properties were analysed in apple and peach samples. It has been demonstrated that the application of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography brings distinct advantages such as enhanced separation of target pesticides from matrix co-extracts as well as their improved detectability. The limits of detection of the pesticides comprised in the study (determined at S/N = 5) ranged from 0.2 to 30 pg, injected with the exception of the last eluted deltamethrin, for which 100 pg could be detected. When compared to one-dimentional GC-TOF MS analysis under essentially the same conditions the detectability enhancement was 1.5-50-fold. Full mass spectral information by time-of-flight mass spectrometry and the deconvolution capability of the dedicated software allowed for reliable identification of most pesticides at levels below 0.01 mg/kg (< 10 pg injected) in fruit. Performance characteristics of the GC x GC-TOF MS method, such as linearity of calibration curves, repeatability of (summed) peak areas, as well as repeatability of first and second dimension retention times, were shown to fully satisfy the requirements for trace level analysis of the pesticide residues in food.",Journal of chromatography.

14521223,"To assess the UV-screening capacity of plant surface structures, the optical properties of isolated cuticle and detached peel of apple fruit (Malus domestica Borkh., cv. Antonovka) have been studied. It was found that the cuticle exhibits considerable scattering of UV radiation, negligible absorption between 500-800 nm and attenuates UV radiation: on average, cuticular transmittance of non-reflected light amounts to 35.7 +/- 20.2 and 14.2 +/- 7.1% at 375 and 300 nm, respectively. The principal UV-A absorbers in the cuticle were identified as quercetin glycosides with an in vivo absorption maximum near 375 nm and content ranging from 10 to 70 nmol cm(-2). On the shaded side of apple fruit, both UV-A and UV-B absorption by the peel is, to a large extent, governed by cuticular phenolics, whereas on the sunlit surface, the absorption of the peel in the UV-A range is determined mainly by vacuolar peel flavonoids. It is concluded that a massive build-up of flavonoids in the peel cells located just below the cuticle, resulting in trapping of radiation in a broad spectral range, plays a dominant role in the long-term adaptation of apple fruit to elevated levels of solar radiation.",Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,"['D005638', 'D027845', 'D008858', 'D010636', 'D019441', 'D011794', 'D013053', 'D014466']","['Fruit', 'Malus', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Phenols', 'Plant Epidermis', 'Quercetin', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",Optical properties and contribution of cuticle to UV protection in plants: experiments with apple fruit.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000502', 'Q000031', 'Q000379', None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'physiology', 'analogs & derivatives', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14521223,2003

12956512,"A high quality of mass reared parasitoids is required for successful biological control of pest insects. Although the phenomenon of behavioral deterioration of parasitoids due to rearing in artificial conditions is well known, its significance is often underestimated, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly investigated. We quantified behavioral alterations of parasitoids reared in an artificial system vs. a natural system and elucidated some of the mechanisms involved. The model systems consisted of apple fruits (natural system) or an artificial diet devoid of apple (artificial system), the herbivore Cydia pomonella, and its larval parasitoid Hyssopus pallidus, a candidate biological control agent. Two parasitoid strains, one reared for 30 generations in the natural system and one in the artificial system, were compared by using the females' ability to respond to frass from codling moth caterpillars fed on apple fruits (apple-frass). The searching response of parasitoids reared in the artificial system compared to those reared in the natural system was reduced by an average of 53.2%. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of the two types of caterpillars' food and of the two corresponding types of frass showed that 15 compounds were present only in apple fruits and apple-frass, three compounds only in artificial diet and artificial-diet-frass, while four compounds were present in both frass types but not in the food sources. This suggests the presence of a food-derived and a host-derived component in the frass. Results from both bioassays and chemical analyses indicate that the kairomonal activity of the frass is due to both apple fruit and host components. The reduced response of parasitoids reared in artificial conditions might, therefore, be due to a lack of recognition of the apple fruit component.

Superdex G75 gel filtration chromatography identified a higher molecular weight (HMW) papain inhibitory fraction (22-26 kDa) and a lower molecular weight papain and trypsin inhibitory fraction (6-12 kDa). The lower molecular weight fraction was separated into a trypsin inhibitor (designated Trp1) and early (designated Pap1) and late (designated Pap2) eluting papain inhibitors after anion exchange (Hitrap SP) chromatography. For Pap2, two inhibitory peaks (designated Pap2-1 and Pap2-2) were identified after further anion exchange (Resource S) chromatography. Each of these lower molecular weight inhibitors was purified by reverse phase HPLC to homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE and by mass spectrometry. The HMW papain inhibitory fraction was purified further by anion-exchange (Hitrap Q followed by Resource Q) column chromatography where a minor inhibitor (HMWPap1) and major inhibitor (HMWPap2) fraction were identified. The relative abundance in seeds of apple and the spectrum of proteinase inhibition has been determined for all of these inhibitors. Reverse-phase HPLC separated HMWPap2 into a minor (HMWPap2-1) and a major (HMWPap2-2) inhibitory fraction, and SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry confirmed that HMWPap2-2 was purified to homogeneity. Amino acid composition data were obtained from Trp1, Pap1, Pap2-2, and HMWPap2-2, and N-terminal sequence data from Trp1, Pap2-1, Pap2-2, and HMWPap2-2, with two of these sequences (Pap2-2 and HMWPap2-2) perfectly matching predicted protein sequences based on EST sequences from an apple database.

The parameters investigated for the optimization of APPI were the ion source parameters fragmentor voltage, capillary voltage, and vaporizer temperature, and also mobile phase composition and flow rate. Furthermore, chemical noise and signal suppression of analyte signals due to sample matrix interference were investigated for both APCI and APPI. The results indicated that APPI provides lower chemical noise and signal suppression in comparison with APCI.

Attempts to separate these two proteins were unsuccessful. Amino acid composition and N-terminal amino acid sequence of these subunits were also identified and N-terminal sequences showed some similarity to that of cottonseed storage globulin.

The apples used as starting material for these productions are frequently contaminated by mycotoxin-producing moulds and damaged during transport and handling. The current study was undertaken to investigate whether patulin (PAT) is present in the industrial or handicraft-made apple juices and ciders consumed by the Belgian population and to assess the population's exposure to this mycotoxin through apple-based drinks. Belgian (n = 29) and imported (14) apple juices as well as ciders (7) were assayed for PAT by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet light detection. PAT was detected respectively in 79, 86 and 43% of these tested samples. However, no contaminated sample exceeded the safe level of 50 microg PAT l(-1). Levels of PAT contamination were comparable in Belgian and imported juice samples. The overall mean PAT concentrations were 9.0 and 3.4 microg l(-1) for contaminated apple juices and ciders, respectively. This study also indicates that there was no statistically significant difference in the mean PAT contamination between clear (7.8 microg l(-1)) and cloudy (10.7 microg l(-1)) apple juices, as well as between handicraft-made apple juices (14.6 microg l(-1)) and industrial ones (7.0 microg l(-1)).

12701701,"A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for fenoxycarb was adapted for quantitative detection of this insect growth regulator in various environmental, agricultural, food and biological matrices. Environmental samples were taken from soil and surface waters in Hungary. The ELISA enabled fenoxycarb detection in surface waters in the 1.1-125 ng ml(-1) concentration range without sample cleanup. In contrast, soil produced a strong matrix effect due to humic acids and other soil components. Several fruit homogenates and commercial fruit juices (eg apple, pear, grape) were analyzed by the ELISA. The assay was found to be suitable for analysis of fenoxycarb in fruit juices diluted 1:40. Biological samples included insect, fish and bovine tissues. The ELISA was applied to detect fenoxycarb in various biological matrices from larvae of the silkworm, Bombyx mori L. The assay proved useful for the analysis of haemolymph diluted 1:10 or at higher dilutions. Fat body and whole body homogenates, however, caused severe matrix effects. Fenoxycarb was detected in liver homogenates (diluted 1:40) from fish treated with various doses of fenoxycarb, and the concentrations determined correlated with the applied doses. The method was used to analyze spiked bovine urine samples diluted 1:10 or at greater dilutions. Fenoxycarb content determined by the ELISA in water and fruit juice samples was validated using GC-MS with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) sample preparation.

Isotopic techniques are commonly used to identify the addition of low cost sugars to fruit juices and are difficult to circumvent as it is not economically viable to change the isotopic ratios of the sugars. The procedure utilizes the derivative hexamethylenetetramine, which is produced through chemical transformation of a sugar degradation product and provides position-specific (13)C and (2)H ratios that relate to the parent sugar molecule. The new procedure has advantages over methods using nitro-sugar derivatives in terms of analysis time and sensitivity.

Their efficiency depends on the size and composition of their oligomeric structures. The mean degree of polymerization of these compounds is usually estimated by thiolysis with thiol-alpha-toluene followed by analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We show the development of a mixed micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method for the separation of the major components obtained after thiolysis with cysteamine (catechins and their cysteamine conjugates). MEKC studies using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS as pseudostationary phase led to long migration times, e.g., with 100 mM SDS, at pH 7, the solutes were separated in about 40 min), while the use of sodium cholate (SC) produced an elution window relatively short. Using a mixed micellar SC-SDS system (50 mM phosphate at pH 7 containing 40 mM SC and 10 mM SDS), it is possible to separate these compounds in less than 15 min.

12517106,"Eight freshly distilled samples of Calvados, a fermented and distilled apple juice, were analyzed by sensory evaluation and direct injection GC to determine the composition of higher alcohols, esters, and aldehydes. The composition determined by direct injection was tentatively related to sensory descriptors. Esters have a probable maximum level around 500 g/hl of pure alcohol (PA). This level also corresponds to the threshold of the main ester constituent, ethyl acetate. A high ratio of esters to ethyl acetate seems to be of prime importance for good quality. Total aldehydes, with a maximum level between 8 and 11 g/hl of PA and mainly comprising acetal (maximum between 5 and 9 g/hl of PA), were related to a ""green"" descriptor. Higher alcohols do not have a direct impact on quality, but other volatile compounds with a positive impact on flavor should probably be present at a high level. As overall quality was not well related to sensory quality, it was necessary to perform more a precise analysis to determine the key odorants. The Calvados samples were thus extracted using pentane. Gas chromatography, employing both a flame ionization detector and an olfactometry port, was used to analyze the obtained extracts. Seventy-one odors were detected and distributed according to Calvados quality determined by sensory evaluation.

Strontium, barium, zinc, and cadmium then increased beginning in the early 1800s for approximately 50 years then decreased to present day 2000. Significantly, similar changes seen in Ca, Mg, and Zn in other studies have been attributed to acid rain, whereas, in our study area there is no history of anthropogenic acid rain. Most importantly, our data goes back to the mid-1600s several hundred years further back than most other studies of this nature.

12428978,"We have investigated the inhibitory effects of polyphenols from natural products, such as green tea, bilberry, grape, ginkgo, and apple, on rainbow trout gelatinase activities. Gelatinases from the skin, muscle, and blood of rainbow trout contained serine proteinase, metalloproteinase, and other proteinase activities as measured by gelatin zymography. The polyphenols of green tea caused the strong inhibition of some gelatinase activities when compared with those of the other products. This inhibition was quite similar to that of metalloproteinase by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, suggesting that the effects of green tea polyphenols on proteinase activities are specific for metalloproteinases. The major catechins of green tea polyphenols were then separated and identified by reverse-phase chromatography to be (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epicatechin gallate, and (-)-epicatechin. The effects of these catechins on gelatinase activities were examined; the most potent inhibitor of metalloproteinase activities was found to be EGCG.

12374416,"A collaborative study was conducted to determine multiple pesticide residues in apple, green bean, and carrot by using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Seventeen laboratories from 7 countries participated in the final study, and a variety of different instruments was used by collaborators. The procedure simply entails 3 steps: (1) mix 1.1 g drying agent (Hydromatrix) per 1 g frozen precomminuted sample, and load 4-5.5 g of this mixture into a 7-10 mL extraction vessel; (2) perform SFE for 20-30 min with a 1-2 mL/min flow rate of carbon dioxide at 0.85 g/mL density (320 atm, 60 degrees C); and (3) inject the extract, which was collected on a solid-phase or in a liquid trap, into the gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, using either an ion-trap instrument in full-scan mode or a quadrupole-type instrument in selected-ion monitoring mode. The ability of GC/MS to simultaneously quantitate and confirm the identity of the semivolatile analytes at trace concentrations is a strong feature of the approach. The selectivity of SFE and GC/MS avoids the need for post-extraction cleanup steps, and the conversion of the CO2 solvent to a gas after SFE eliminates the solvent evaporation step common in traditional methods. The approach has several advantages, but its main drawback is the lower recoveries for the most polar analytes, such as methamidophos and acephate, and the most nonpolar analytes, such as pyrethroids. Recoveries for most pesticides are >75%, and recoveries of nonpolar analytes are still >50%. The (within-laboratory) repeatability relative standard deviation (RSDr) values of the recoveries are generally <15%. More specifically, the average results from the 9-14 laboratories in the final analysis of 6 blind duplicates at 3 concentrations for each pesticide are as follows: carbofuran in apple (75-500 ng/g), 89% recovery, 7% RSDr, 9% reproducibility relative standard deviation (RSDR); diazinon in apple (60-400 ng/g), 83% recovery, 13% RSDr, 17% RSDR; vinclozolin in apple (6-400 ng/g), 97% recovery, 13% RSDr, 18% RSDR; chlorpyrifos in apple (50-300 ng/g), 105% recovery, 11% RSDr, 13% RSDR; endosulfan sulfate in apple (150-1000 ng/g), 95% recovery, 15% RSDr, 17% RSDR; trifluralin in green bean (30-200 ng/g), 58% recovery, 11% RSDr, 27% RSDR; dacthal in green bean (60-400 ng/g), 88% recovery, 11% RSDr, 17% RSDR; quintozene in green bean (60-400 ng/g), 79% recovery, 13% RSDr, 18% RSDR; chlorpyrifos in green bean (50-300 ng/g), 84% recovery, 11% RSDr, 17% RSDR; p,p'-DDE in green bean (45-300 ng/g), 64% recovery, 14% RSDr, 27% RSDR; atrazine in carrot (75-500 ng/g), 90% recovery, 11% RSDr, 15% RSDR; metalaxyl in carrot (75-500 ng/g), 89% recovery, 8% RSDr, 12% RSDR; parathion-methyl in carrot (75-500 ng/g), 84% recovery, 14% RSDr, 15% RSDR; chlorpyrifos in carrot (50-300 ng/g), 77% recovery, 13% RSDr, 19% RSDR; and bifenthrin in carrot (90-600 ng/g), 63% recovery, 12% RSDr, and 25% RSDR.

12228256,"The 1.6-A crystal structure of the covalent ketimine complex of apple 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase with the potent inhibitor l-aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) is described. ACC synthase catalyzes the committed step in the biosynthesis of ethylene, a plant hormone that is responsible for the initiation of fruit ripening and for regulating many other developmental processes. AVG is widely used in plant physiology studies to inhibit the activity of ACC synthase. The structural assignment is supported by the fact that the complex absorbs maximally at 341 nm. These results are not in accord with the recently reported crystal structure of the tomato ACC synthase AVG complex, which claims that the inhibitor only associates noncovalently. The rate constant for the association of AVG with apple ACC synthase was determined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry (2.1 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1)) and by the rate of loss of enzyme activity (1.1 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1)).

Granny Smith apples were surface sterilized with 76% ethanol and inoculated with 0.1 ml of a 1.1 x 10(7) spore/ml P. expansum spore suspension. The apples were packaged either in polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) and treated with three different gas combinations, viz., 58% CO2/42% N2, 48% CO2/52% N2, and 88% CO2/12% N2, and were then incubated for 14 days at 25 degrees C. Fungal growth was monitored every 2 to 4 days by measuring radial growth from the point of inoculation. After the 14th day, apples were pulped, and patulin was extracted, purified, and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. PP did not inhibit fungal growth in any of the atmospheres tested, and it only inhibited patulin production in atmospheric gas and 58% CO2/42% N2. PE was very effective and inhibited fungal growth by four- or fivefold, depending on the modified atmosphere. Patulin production in PE-packaged apples was almost completely inhibited by all three gas combinations. Gas chromatographic analysis of the PE-packaged samples before and after the incubation period showed that CO2 levels dropped and N2 levels increased for all of the atmospheres tested.

12018028,"Extracts of apple fruits (Malus domestica cv. ""Brettacher"") were analysed by HPLC with photodiode array detection. An unknown peak was monitored displaying the same retention time as isorhamnetin 3-O-glucoside. Preliminary identification of the isorhamnetin aglycone was performed by comparison of UV spectral data of the unknown compound with a reference substance. Using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode, the presence of an isorhamnetin glycoside was supported by loss of 162 amu from the pseudomolecular ion (m/z 477). MS2 product ion analysis of the parent ion m/z 477 provided a fragmentation pattern identical to the reference. Collision-induced dissociation of the aglycone (m/z 315) in the MS3 product ion analysis allowed the differentiation of rhamnetin and isorhamnetin, and unambiguous assignment by comparison with standard compounds. A second isorhamnetin glycoside eluting prior to the glucoside was tentatively identified as isorhamnetin 3-O-galactoside.

Results showed that an increase in polymeric degree improves the color stability of oenin. Solutions containing a catechin tetramer, purified from brown rice, displayed a remarkable stability. Flavanols as monomers, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, appeared to decrease stability with the formation of a xanthylium salt leading to yellowish solutions. For the dimers, procyanidin B2 and B3, different behaviors on red color stability have been observed corresponding to their different susceptibility to cleavage upon heating. In the presence of the trimeric procyanidin C2, the red color appeared more stable. However, the HPLC chromatograms showed a decrease in the amplitude of the peaks of oenin and procyanidin C2.

Attached conidia were dislodged by sonication and remaining conidia on apple slices were counted by microscopy. Adhesion generally increased as BA increased to 7.2 microg mL(-1), but declined with greater concentrations. BA at 0-3.6 microg mL(-1) for 24 h stimulated adhesion 2-fold greater compared to that at 4 h. Adhesion stimulated by BA increased as a function of time (0-24 h), showing linear trends (r (2) = 0.99; p = 0.01) during 0-12 h. The four esters were similar in their ability to stimulate adhesion.

The products of patulin degradation were more polar than patulin itself and remained in the clarified fermented cider. Patulin did not appear to bind to yeast cells or apple juice sediment in these model experiments.

Although the potential antimutagenic and antioxidant properties of this commercial preparation have been demonstrated, limited information is available on its digestion and absorption by humans. Stability of SCC was examined during simulated gastric and small intestinal digestion. Three preparations were subjected to in vitro digestion: SCC in water, SCC in water + 10% corn oil, and SCC in applesauce. SCC components from raw material preparations and in digested samples were analyzed by C(18) HPLC with photodiode array detection. Cu(II)chlorin e(4), the major chlorin component of SCC, was relatively stable during simulated digestion. In contrast, greater than 90% of Cu(II)chlorin e(6) was degraded to undetermined products during digestion. Recovery of Cu(II)chlorin e(6) after digestion was increased by incorporation of SCC into applesauce, suggesting a protective role of the inclusion matrix for stabilization of labile SCC components. Accumulation of SCC derivatives was investigated by using differentiated cultures of the TC7 clone of the Caco-2 human intestinal cell line. Cellular accumulation from media containing 0.5 to 60 ppm SCC was linear with intracellular content ranging between 0.2 and 29.6 microg of total SCC per mg of cellular protein. Uptake of SCC by Caco-2 cells was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in cultures incubated at 4 degrees C than in those incubated at 37 degrees C. Although intracellular SCC was transported into both apical and basolateral compartments when Caco-2 cells were grown on inserts, apical efflux was significantly greater (p < 0.01) than basolateral efflux.

11767150,"Fungi of the genus Alternaria are parasitic on plants and other organic materials. A. alternata is a frequently occurring species of particular interest because it produces a number of mycotoxins, including alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), altenuene (ALT), altertoxins I, II, and III (ATX-I, -II, and -III), and L-tenuazonic acid (TeA). Cleanup procedures of analytical methods for foods and foodstuffs include solvent partition, generally used for TeA, and solid-phase extraction columns for AOH, AME, and ATX-I. These Alternaria mycotoxins have been determined by TLC, GC, and more usually LC, mainly with ultraviolet detection, although fluorescence and electrochemical detection have also been used for Alternaria toxins other than TeA. A Zn2+ salt is usually added to the LC mobile phase for TeA. Recently, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and electrospray LC/MS and LC-MS/MS have been applied to the determination and confirmation of AOH and AME in apple juice and other fruit beverages at sub ng/mL levels. Natural occurrences of AOH, AME, and in some cases other Alternaria toxins have been reported in various fruits, including tomatoes, olives, mandarins, melons, peppers, apples, and raspberries.

Nonfusion proteins were obtained by factor Xa protease treatment. The highest degree of amino-acid sequence identity of Pyr c 5 and Bet v 6 was found with a plant protein related to a defense mechanism, which we have named phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase (PCBER) based on its ability to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of 8-5' linked lignans such as dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol to give isodihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol. Enzymatic assays with recombinant Pyr c 5 and Bet v 6 showed PCBER catalytic activity for both recombinant allergens. Both Pyr c 5 and Bet v 6 allergens had similar IgE binding characteristics in immunoblotting and enzyme allergosorbent tests (EAST), and bound IgE from 10 sera of birch-pollen-allergic patients including six pear-allergic subjects.

The current residue definition of dithiocarbamates in food for compliance with maximum residue limits, at national and international levels, is total residues arising from the use of any or each dithiocarbamate fungicide, determined as CS(2). The analytical method most frequently used to analyze dithiocarbamate residues in food for monitoring purposes was proposed more than 30 years ago. In this method, total dithiocarbamates are decomposed to CS(2), which is purified and reacted with a cupric reagent. The yellow complex formed is quantified by spectrophotometry. In this paper, a new reaction system for the purification and complexation of CS(2) is proposed. The new system is less fragile than the traditional design, is easier to assemble, and allows for a higher sample throughput, in addition to being of low cost.

Various methods are currently used to reduce the levels of patulin in apple juice, namely, charcoal treatment, chemical preservation (sulfur dioxide), gamma irradiation, fermentation, and trimming of fungus-infected apples. Many of these processes are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need to find a convenient and economical process to control patulin levels. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of several clarification processes for the reduction of patulin. Clarification was carried out on a laboratory scale. Apple pulp was spiked with patulin, pressed, and clarified using four different processes, namely, fining with bentonite, enzyme (pectinase) treatment, paper filtration, and centrifugation. Patulin was recovered from the clarified juice by liquid-liquid extraction, and solid-phase chromatography was used for sample clean-up prior to analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The minimum detectable limit using HPLC was 20 microg/liter. Pressing followed by centrifugation resulted in an average toxin reduction of 89%. Total toxin reduction using filtration, enzyme treatment, and fining were 70, 73, and 77%, respectively. Patulin reduction was due to the binding of the toxin to solid substrates that was verified by analyzing the clarified juice as well as the filter cake, pellet, and sediment. The combined concentrations correlated to the spiked concentration. These results reveal that clarification was successful in the reduction of patulin levels in apple juice.

We describe the suitability of high-performance anion-exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection for the identification and quantification of fructans in fresh fruits (various apple and pear cultivars, plum, banana) as well as in commercial stewed fruits obtained from a local manufacturer. After extraction with water and appropriate filtration, inulobiose [beta-D-Fru-(2-->1)-beta-D-fructofuranoside; F2], 1-kestose [beta-D-Fru-(2-->1)2-alpha-D-glucopyranoside; GF2] and nystose [beta-D-Fru-(2-->1)3-alpha-D-glucopyranoside; GF3] were completely separated in a single 36-min run using a Dionex CarboPac PA 100 column and the new quadruple-potential waveform, originally tailored for oligosaccharide separation. No measurable amounts of F3 and GF4 were detected within the group of studied fruit products. Peak identification was realized using standards. The method is easy, reproducible, and sensitive since as little as 28 microg of sugar per gram dry matter can be quantified. Banana and plum are the varieties containing the highest levels of fructans (about 6000 microg per gram dry matter). The maturity of the fruit appears to have a great influence on the level of GF2. Samples of apple-banana stewed fruits contained the highest total fructan concentration (about 700 microg per gram dry matter).

11397434,"Emission rates of monoterpenes released by apple (Malus domestica Borkh) and cherry (Prunus avium L.) were estimated at different phenological stages. These measurements employed a dynamic flow-through Teflon chamber, sample collection onto cartridges filled with graphitized carbon and thermal desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for identification and quantification of the emitted volatiles. At full bloom the release of monoterpene hydrocarbons from cherry flowers was 1213 ng g(-1) dry weight (DW) h(-1), exceeding by approximately three-fold the emission rate of apple flowers (366 ng g(-1) DW h(-1)). Observed seasonal variations in biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions ranged over several order of magnitudes. At fruit-set and ripening stages, in fact, the hydrocarbon emission dramatically decreased reaching the lowest values at harvest time when leaves were fully mature (3-9 ng g(-1) DW h(-1)). Wide diversity in the composition of compounds from the species studied was also recorded. At blooming, linalool contributed significantly to the monoterpene emission from apple (94% of the emitted carbon) while alpha-pinene and camphene represented on average more than 60% of the total emitted volatiles from cherry flowers. Among the monoterpenes identified in flowers, alpha-pinene, camphene and limonene were also found in the foliage emission of both species. Fruit trees are relevant monoterpene emitters only at blooming and thus for a short period of the vegetative cycle. When leaves are fully developed, the carbon loss due to monoterpene emissions related to the photosynthetically carbon gain is negligible.",Phytochemistry,"['D008401', 'D019685', 'D012621', 'D013729', 'D014835']","['Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Rosales', 'Seasons', 'Terpenes', 'Volatilization']",Seasonal variation of monoterpene emission from Malus domestica and Prunus avium.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11397434,2001

In this study, individual phenolics were measured by diode-array HPLC at monthly intervals in the peel of Granny Smith, Lady Williams, and Crofton apple cultivars stored in air at 0 degrees C for 9 months. The concentrations of total phenolics significantly differed among the cultivars examined, with Lady Williams peel having significantly more phenolics (over 4000 microg x g(-1) peel fresh weight) than Crofton (2668 microg x g(-1) peel fresh weight) and Granny Smith, which had the lowest concentration of total phenolics (1275 microg x g(-1) peel fresh weight). There were also significant differences in individual phenolics among cultivars and during storage. Quercetin glycosides were the only flavonols identified, with quercetin rhamnoglucoside being the most abundant phenolic in the peel. Chlorogenic acid was the major cinnamic acid derivative, with high concentrations, up to 412 microg x g(-1)) peel fresh weight, in Crofton peel. A pre-storage diphenylamine (DPA) treatment had few significant effects on peel phenolic metabolism. Where differences did occur, fruit treated with DPA retained higher concentrations of total peel phenolics during storage than fruit not treated with DPA. Storage of all cultivars for up to 9 months in air at 0 degrees C induced few significant changes in the peel phenolic concentrations.

The immobilized yeast showed an important operational stability without any decrease of its activity even at low temperatures (1-12 degrees C). Specifically, at 6 degrees C the biocatalyst favored wine production within 8 days, which is less time than is required for the natural fermentation of grape must. At 1 degrees C wine production was effected in 1 month. This speeding up of the fermentation could be accepted and adopted by the industry for scaling up the wine-making process. Total and volatile acidities were similar to those found in dry wines. The concentrations of higher alcohols (propanol-1 and isobutyl alcohol) were low. The presence of amyl alcohols proved to be temperature dependent and decreased with the temperature decrease. The values of ethyl acetate concentrations were relatively high, up to 154 mg/L.

The immunoassay is based on a new monoclonal antibody derived from a hapten functionalized at the nitrogen atom in the 1-position of the thiabendazole structure. To our knowledge, such a structure has not been previously used to obtain antibodies to thiabendazole. The I50 value and the detection limit of the ELISA for standards were 0.2 and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively. Fruit juices were analyzed by diluting samples in assay buffer, without extraction or cleanup. Samples were not even centrifuged or filtered to remove fruit pulp. Under these conditions, the immunoassay was able to accurately determine thiabendazole down to 1 ng/mL in orange and grapefruit juices, down to 5 ng/mL in banana juice, and down to 20 ng/mL in apple and pear juices. Sensitivity differences of the ELISA were caused by the minimum dilution required by each juice to minimize matrix effects: 1/10 for orange and grapefruit juices, 1/50 for banana juice, and 1/100 for apple and pear juices. In an attempt to further increase the sensitivity of the immunoassay for matrixes showing the strongest interferences, apple and pear juices spiked with thiabendazole at low levels (1-20 ng/mL) were extracted with ethyl acetate before analysis. This simple procedure entailed a significant reduction of matrix effects, which in fact allowed us to determine accurately as low as 5 ng/mL thiabendazole in apple and pear juices.

The origin of minor amounts of (R)-ethyl 2-methylbutanoate is unknown as naturally occurring (+)-isoleucine, the proposed precursor of (S)-ethyl 2-methylbutanoate is enantiomerically pure. Since ethyl (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoate (ethyl tiglate) was recently discovered as a natural apple constituent and hydrogenation activity in apples was demonstrated we proposed ethyl tiglate as a precursor of (R)-ethyl 2-methylbutanoate. D4-3,4,4,4-ethyl tiglate was synthesized and was injected into ripe apple fruits (cv. Golden Delicious, Red Delicious and Granny Smith). After 3, 6, and 12 days apple volatiles were isolated by solid phase extraction on XAD-2 and the metabolites formed from D4-3,4,4,4-ethyl tiglate were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, 2-methylbutanol, and 2-methylbutanoic acid were identified as major transformation products. Chiral evaluation of the metabolites by multidimensional GC-MS revealed enantiomeric excesses ranging from 43% (S) to 30% (R) depending on the apple cultivar, sampling date and metabolite. The data show for the first time that the natural apple constituent ethyl tiglate can serve as a source for (R)-2-methylbutanol derivatives.",Enantiomer,[],[],Metabolism of ethyl tiglate in apple fruits leads to the formation of small amounts of (R)-ethyl 2-methylbutanoate.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11143814,2002

Purified dsRNA was used to generate cDNA clones which were sequenced and the information used to design oligonucleotide primers for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and tube capture (TC)/RT-PCR analyses. Oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCR analysis and dot blot hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled cDNA clones were used for the detection of FAV and Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV) in C. quinoa, in leaf and bud wood tissue of apple, or both. Primers JQ3D33FF/FR amplified a virus-specific 429-bp fragment and reliably detected all isolates of FAV and CRLV tested by RT-PCR and TC/RT-PCR. Primers JQ2C1FF/FR amplified a 370-bp fragment and detected FAV and some isolates of CRLV. Comparison of amino acid residues derived from the 429-bp fragments of FAV and CRLV gave 95% identity. The RT-PCR assays provided strong evidence of a relationship between FAV and CRLV. These assays were also used to confirm virus elimination in apple plants after heat therapy. Western blot analysis of FAV revealed capsid protein subunits of approximately 22 and 24 kDa. Our data support biological and serological evidence that FAV and CRLV are isolates of the same virus. Searches of the database produced sequence matches only with RNA2 of Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV), a new member of the family Comoviridae. This suggests that both primer pairs presumably target regions on RNA2 of FAV/CRLV and that these viruses may be more closely related to ALSV than to other members of this family.",Plant disease,[],[],Molecular Evidence of the Relationship Between a Virus Associated with Flat Apple Disease and Cherry rasp leaf virus as Determined by RT-PCR.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832070,2019
11128219,"An HPLC-MS-MS method with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for the determination of patulin in apple juice samples is described. Mass spectrometric detection was accomplished following atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in both positive and negative ion modes. Collision induced dissociation (CID) of the protonated molecular ion led initially to the loss of H2O (fragment m/z 137). At higher energies CO is lost from both the protonated parent molecule (fragment m/z 127) and the dehydrated molecular ion (fragment m/z 109). In contrast, CID of the deprotonated molecular ion led initially to the fragment at m/z 109 corresponding to the loss of either CO2 or acetaldehyde, followed at higher CID energy by the loss of H2O (fragment m/z 135) and CO (fragment m/z 125) from the deprotonated molecular ion. Detection in the negative ion mode proved superior and a linear response was observed over the injected range from 6 to 200 ng patulin. Apple juice samples spiked with patulin between 10 and 135 microg/l were analyzed following liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate and clean up with sodium carbonate. Utilizing reversed-phase HPLC with acetonitrile-water (10:90) at 0.5 ml/min, levels down to 10 microg/l were readily quantified and a detection limit of 4 microg/l was attainable at a signal-to-noise (SIN) ratio of 4.

In the course of studies designed to discover its maximum microbial lethality under food-processing conditions, a gas chromatographic-mass spectrophotometric procedure was developed for the extraction and analysis of essential oil components such as cinnamaldehyde from commercial cinnamon-containing foods (several brands of cinnamon breads, cereals, cookies, puddings, applesauces, and fruit juices). The cinnamaldehyde content ranged from trace amounts in orange juice to 12.2 mg/100 g (122 ppm) in apple cinnamon cereals and 31.1 mg/100 g (311 ppm) for cinnamon swirl bread (highest value). To ascertain the heat stability of cinnamaldehyde, pure cinnamaldehyde, pure eugenol, cinnamon oil, and mixtures consisting of cinnamaldehyde plus eugenol or cinnamon oil were heated at graded temperatures up to 210 degrees C and 60 min, and then possible compositional changes were examined. Eugenol was stable to heat, as were the components of cinnamon oil: carvone, eugenol, and linalool. In contrast, starting at approximately 60 degrees C, pure cinnamaldehyde undergoes a temperature-dependent transformation to benzaldehyde under the influence of heat. Eugenol, both pure and in cinnamon oil, when added to pure cinnamaldehyde protected the aldehyde against heat destruction. The protection may due to an antioxidative action of eugenol.

11087482,"An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and most of the berries.

Detection of low populations of A. acidoterrestris that would precede sensory detection of guaiacol would enable juice processors to select appropriate processing and storage conditions that would minimize or eliminate spoilage. The objective of this study was to determine the recognition threshold of guaiacol in apple juice by sensory analysis and the population of A. acidoterrestris and incubation time at 21 and 37 degrees C necessary for chemical detection of guaiacol. Commercially sterilized apple juice (pH 3.54 +/- 0.04, 11.3 +/- 0.3 degrees Brix) was inoculated with a five-strain mixture of A. acidoterrestris spores (2.98 log10 CFU/ml) and stored at 21 or 37 degrees C for up to 61 days. Using an experienced sensory panel and the forced-choice ascending concentration method of limits, the best estimate threshold (BET) for recognition of guaiacol added to uninoculated apple juice was 2.23 ppb. Numbers of A. acidoterrestris spores and cells in inoculated juice remained constant during the 61-day storage period; however, the panel detected (P < or = 0.01) guaiacol in juice stored at 37 degrees C within 8 days. At three of four sampling times ranging from 13 to 61 days at which the sensory panel detected (P < or = 0.001) guaiacol, concentrations of 8.1 to 11.4 ppb were detected by chromatographic analysis. The panel detected (P < or = 0.1 to P < or = 0.01) guaiacol in five samples stored at 21 to 37 degrees C for 8 to 61 days in which the compound was not detected by chromatographic analyses.

Comparison of the spectra shows that apple anthocyanins in vivo possess a symmetric absorption band at 500-600 nm with a maximum near 550 nm. Anthocyanins considerably increase light absorption by apples. In on-tree-ripening Zhigulevskoe apples, accumulating high amounts of anthocyanin pigments, chlorophyll contents in sunlit and shaded sides of the fruits are found to be similar. In contrast, frequently considerably lower chlorophyll content is estimated in sunlit compared with shaded sides of Antonovka apples exhibiting low potential for anthocyanin formation. Sunlight also brings about an increase of carotenoid content over that of chlorophylls and accumulation of substances responsible for light absorption in the range 350-400 nm. The rates of high-light-induced chlorophyll bleaching in red zones of fruit containing anthocyanins are considerably lower than those in green zones and decrease with an increase in the pigment content. Anthocyanins show more stability to irradiation than chlorophylls. A protective function of anthocyanins against both light-induced stress in, and damage to, apples is suggested.

On average, chocolate and apples contained the largest procyanidin content per serving (164.7 and 147.1 mg, respectively) compared with red wine and cranberry juice (22.0 and 31.9 mg, respectively). However, the procyanidin content varied greatly between apple samples (12.3-252.4 mg/serving) with the highest amounts on average observed for the Red Delicious (207.7 mg/serving) and Granny Smith (183.3 mg/serving) varieties and the lowest amounts in the Golden Delicious (92.5 mg/serving) and McIntosh (105.0 mg/serving) varieties.

10910223,"A rapid and reliable method is presented for the determination of the preservatives sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate in fruit juices, sodas, soy sauce, ketchup, peanut butter, cream cheese, and other foods. The procedure utilizes high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by UV diode array detection for identification and quantitation of the two preservatives. Liquid samples were prepared by diluting 1 ml of the sample with 10 ml of an acetonitrile/ammonium acetate buffer solution. Samples of viscous or solid foods were prepared by blending the sample with the same buffer solution in a 1:5 ratio followed by a dilution identical to liquid samples. All samples were filtered to remove particulate matter prior to analysis. The HPLC determination of the preservatives was performed using a reversed-phase C18 column and UV detection at 225 nm for sodium benzoate and 255 nm potassium sorbate. The percentage of preservative in the sample was calculated by external standard using authentic sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate. Apple juice, apple sauce, soy sauce, and peanut butter, spiked at 0.10 and 0.050% for both sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate, yielded recoveries ranging from 82 to 96%.

The fruits, harvested preclimacteric at approximately the same stages of maturity, were stored in refrigerated air (RA) for 45 days or in controlled atmosphere (CA) for 180 days at 0 degrees C. Volatile evolution, ethylene production, and respiration of stored fruit were studied during poststorage holding at 22 degrees C. ReTain reduced volatile production by 19%, but application of Ethrel to ReTain-treated fruit increased production to control levels. The inhibition of volatile production by ReTain appears to be independent of respiration but may be related to the ethylene-producing capacity of the fruit. Although ReTain reduced flavor-related volatile esters, it did not affect levels of the compound responsible for the typical spicy flavor in Jonagored Jonagold fruit, 4-methoxy-2-propenylbenzene. The CA-stored fruit had a much reduced production of volatile compounds compared to RA-stored fruit, with more discernible effects in ReTain-treated fruit. Ethrel application to ReTain-treated fruit improved the volatile production intermediate between the ReTain alone and control in CA-stored fruit.

The results revealed that in extract II, besides the two above-mentioned aroma compounds, both had FD factors of 16 384; delta-decalactone, gamma-dodecalactone additionally, and 6-dodeceno-gamma-lactone contributed with very high FD factors (FD 8192) to the overall aroma. In general, the thermal treatment led to the formation of 15 new odorants which were not detected in I. Furthermore, the lactones and beta-damascenone were significantly increased in II, thereby indicating their generation from precursors in the fresh juice.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D005511', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D006358', 'D009812']","['Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hot Temperature', 'Odorants']",Differences in key odorants of handmade juice of yellow-flesh peaches (Prunus persica L.) induced by the workup procedure.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10552883,2000

Each subject was given 1.13 micromol (500 microg) of [2H4]folic acid orally on the morning of d 70 of the study, followed by a complete 24-h urine collection.

The cells responded to the challenge by production of novel compounds. Suspension cultures of the scab-susceptible cultivar McIntosh, when similarly challenged, showed no detectable response. The major compound produced by scab-resistant cells in response to the challenge has been identified as the 2,4-methoxy-3-hydroxy-9-O-beta-D-glucosyloxydibenzofuran by UV, mass spectrometry, (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and (13)C-NMR spectroscopy. We suggest the trivial name malusfuran for the compound. Malusfuran production was initiated approximately 24 h after being challenged. Malusfuran inhibited spore germination and growth of Venturia inaequalis at millimolar concentrations, indicating its role as a possible phytoalexin. The aglycone of malusfuran, 2,4-methoxy-3,9-hydroxy-dibenzofuran, showed higher toxicity to V. inaequalis than to the parent malusfuran. In vitro cultures of V. inaequalis produced a beta-glucosidase that hydrolyzed ortho- and para-substituted nitrophenyl-beta-glucosides, suggesting that the aglycone may act as the actual phytoalexin.",Phytopathology,[],[],Phytoalexin Production in an Apple Cultivar Resistant to Venturia inaequalis.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18945056,2012
15739455,"A liquid chromatographic method using semi-microcolumn separation combined with laser resonance Raman detection was developed for the determination of monosaccharides in fruit juices. Reducing sugars (galactose, glucose, mannose, arabinose, xylose and ribose) were derivatized with 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-sulfonyl (DABSYL) hydrazine. The derivatives of the monosaccharides exhibited strong resonance Raman scattering at 1136 cm(-1) when Ar+ laser emission line 488.0 nm was used. A semi-microcolumn Inertsil ODS-2 (250 mm x 1.5 mm i.d.) was used to the separation of the monosaccharide derivatives. The saccharides eluted within 25 min. However the excess DABSYL hydrazine was retained strongly with a retention time of about 60 min. In order to reduce the longer analysis time, the excess DABSYL hydrazine was removed by adding glyoxylic acid and then Na2CO3 aqueous solution when the derivation reaction was finished. As a result, the analysis time was reduced to about a half of its initial run time. The sensitivity of resonance Raman detection greater two orders of magnitude than refractive index (RI) detection. The detection limit of glucose is 10 ng (5.5 pmol). The high selectivity of Raman detection came from the facts that only the interested compounds in a given sample was derived with the Raman labeling reagent and that only the characteristic Raman bands of the derivatives were selectively detected.

9129299,"Ethylenethiourea (ETU) is a decomposition product from ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamates (EBDCs), the most widely used class of fungicides in the world. ETU has been classified as a possible human carcinogen. The maximum permitted residue level (MRL) in the European Union was set at 0.05 ppm. Gas chromatographic determination of ETU can be achieved only after derivatization. ETU is extracted from food samples and cleaned up by a combination of two-step derivatization and liquid-liquid partitioning. In the first step, ETU is derivatized with benzyl chloride to form S-benzyl ETU, which is then trifluoroacetylated to form the final product, which is amenable to GC. The determination is carried out with capillary gas chromatography using electron-capture (ECD) and nitrogen-phosphorus detection (NPD) as selective detection methods in parallel. The responses of ECD and NPD were found to be of the same order of magnitude. Therefore, the parallel response was found to be a useful criterion for peak identification down to the limit of detection. Reproducibility of the two-step derivatization of ETU to form trifluoroacetylated S-benzyl ETU was found to be satisfactory. The recoveries from apple, pear, tomato and a common baby food, at various concentration levels, were found to be between 82-92%, with a limit of detection of less than 1 ppb. Commercial samples, submitted for routine monitoring of dithiocarbamates (DTC) were also monitored in our laboratory for the presence of ETU. Four of the twenty samples found positive for DTC were also found to be contaminated with ETU in the range of 0.01 to 0.37 ppm. Three of these food samples were found to contain ETU residues above the MRL of 0.05, while those food samples containing DTC residues between 0.2 and 0.8 ppm were all below the MRL of DTC. No relation exists between the DTC residues concentration and the level of ETU. The screening data were further confirmed by electron impact mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring mode.

White grape-juices (3) as well as other fruit juices (2 apple, 6 orange, 2 others) did not contain OA (< 5 pg/ml). The analytical method used was not appropriate for grapefruit-juices because of an interfering substance. The results indicate that OA is formed prior to the alcoholic fermentation. It also appears that the more southerly in Europe is the origin of the samples the higher is the frequency of occurrence and the concentration of OA in red wines and red grape-juices. Although the estimated mean daily OA intake of 0-7 ng/kg body mass (men) can easily be more than doubled by moderate wine consumption, an additional health risk by OA is not to be expected. On the other hand the consumption of red grape-juices among infants and children may result in intakes high enough to justify a reduction of the OA concentrations in these juices to less than 100 pg/ml.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D001628', 'D002851', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D009183', 'D009793', 'D018570', 'D014920']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mycotoxins', 'Ochratoxins', 'Risk Assessment', 'Wine']",Ochratoxin A in table wine and grape-juice: occurrence and risk assessment.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000008', None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8871123,1997

9064745,"The studies on the analytical procedure for mercury determination in food of plant origin on the level of 5 micrograms/kg, were carried out. For this reason, microwave digestion with HNO3 and cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS) with tin (II) chloride reduction, were used. Both digestion and determination conditions were experimentally optimized. The procedure was checked using two real food samples: apple juice and preserved carrot with peas both spiked on two levels with mercury. On these results basic statistic parameters that characterized the method as standard deviation, relative standard deviation and recovery, were calculated. The precision was generally better than 10%, and recovery ranged from 96 to 100%. The detection limit of the entire procedure, defined as the mercury concentration corresponding to three times the standard deviation of ten consecutive determinations of blank measurement, was 0.012 microgram/l. Taking into account the amount of a sample and the factor of dilution the detection limit corresponds to 0.3 microgram/kg for 1.0 g, 1.0 microgram/kg for 0.3 g, and 0.15 microgram/l for 2 ml of a sample. Accuracy of the analytical procedure was tested by analysing five certified reference plant materials with the mercury contents ranged from 6 to 280 micrograms/kg. The obtained results were in a good agreement with their certified values.

This study was designed to determine whether such children are exposed to higher levels of pesticides than children whose parents are not involved in agriculture and whose homes are not close to farms. Household dust and soil samples were collected in children's play areas from 59 residences in eastern Washington State (26 farming, 22 farmworker, and 11 nonfarming families). The majority of the farm families lived within 200 feet of an operating apple or pear orchard, whereas all reference homes were located at least a quarter of a mile from an orchard. Four organophosphorous (OP) insecticides commonly used on tree fruit were targeted for analysis: azinphosmethyl, chlorpyrifos, parathion, and phosmet. Samples were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass selective detection. Pesticide concentrations in household dust were significantly higher than in soil for all groups. OP levels for farmer/farm-worker families ranged from nondetectable to 930 ng/g in soil (0.93 ppm) and from nondetectable to 17,000 ng/g in dust (17 ppm); all four OP compounds were found in 62% of household dust samples, and two-thirds of the farm homes contained at least one OP above 1000 ng/g. Residues were found less frequently in reference homes and all levels were below 1000 ng/g. Household dust concentrations for all four target compounds were significantly lower in reference homes when compared to farmer/farmworker homes (Mann Whitney, U test; p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that children of agricultural families have a higher potential for exposure to OP pesticides than children of nonfarm families in this region. Measurable residues of a toxicity, I compound registered exclusively for agricultural use, azcnphosmettyl were found in household dust samples from all study homes, suggesting that low level exposure to such chemicals occurs throughout the region.

High-performance liquid chromatography and behavioral assays were used to relate animal responses with the presence of common cardiac glycosides in several digitalis extracts. Statistical analyses of multiple-choice tests showed no correlation between cardiac glycoside content and mountain beaver avoidance of apple cubes treated with digitalis extracts. Therefore, we concluded that known toxic cardiac glycosides were not responsible for chemosensory cues that inhibited intake of food treated with digitalis extracts. These results suggest that digitalis is a source of an effective nontoxic herbivore repellent.

7580315,"A joint AOAC/American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) collaborative study was conducted to determine by the Uppsala method the dietary fiber content and its composition in various foods. The method includes preparation of a residue by treatment with thermostable alpha-amylase and amyloglucosidase and then ethanol precipitation of solubilized dietary fiber components while leaving low-molecular weight carbohydrates in solution. After acid hydrolysis of residue, neutral polysaccharide residues are determined as alditol acetates by gas-liquid chromatography, uronic acid residues are determined by colorimetry, and ash-free acid-insoluble residue (Klason lignin) is determined gravimetrically. Total dietary fiber, including enzyme-resistant starch, is calculated as the sum of nonstarch polysaccharide residues and Klason lignin. Nine laboratories completed the study, analyzing in duplicate 8 unknown dried products that included 4 cereal products, green peas, potato fiber, carrots, and apples. Total dietary fiber contents of products tested ranged from 4.6 to 84.3%, with an average RSDR value of 8.4% (range, 4.8-11.1%). Total neutral polysaccharide residues ranged from 3.8 to 64.1%, with an average RSDR value of 7.5% (range, 5.4-10.5%). Individual neutral sugars (rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose) and uronic acid residues present at more than 1% generally had good RSDR values (3.3-22.8%), whereas, as expected for Klason lignin, only the wheat bran sample with a high content (16%) had an excellent RSDR value (5.0%).

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that two polypeptides of 44 and 32 kD were present in the fraction that showed activity against the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenol-beta-D-galactopyranoside. The enzyme preparation was incubated with polysaccharide extracts from apple cell walls containing beta-(1-->4)-linked galactans, and products of digestion were analyzed by gas chromatography. Small amounts of monomeric galactose were released during incubation, showing that the enzyme was active against native substrates. Amino acid sequence information was obtained from the purified protein, and this showed high homology with the anticipated polypeptide coded by the ethylene-regulated SR12 gene in carnation (K.G. Raghothama, K.A. Lawton, P.B. Goldborough, W.R. Woodson [1991] Plant Mol Biol 17: 61-71) and a harvest-related pTIP31 cDNA from asparagus (G. King, personal communication). Using the asparagus cDNA clone as a probe, an apple homolog (pABG1) was isolated. This clone contains a 2637-bp insert, including an open reading frame that codes for a polypeptide of 731 amino acids. Cleavage of an N-terminal signal sequence would leave a predicted polypeptide of 78.5 kD. Genomic DNA analysis and the isolation of other homologous apple clones suggest that pABG1 represents one member of an apple beta-galactosidase gene family.

Fourteen fungicides (dichloran, vinclozolin, chlorthalonil, triadimefon, dichlofluanide, procymidone, hexaconazole, captan, folpet, ditalimfos, iprodione, captafol, pyrazophos and fenarimol) were determined using the described procedure with recoveries between 83 and 107% at spiking levels ranging for the different compounds from 0.04 to 0.40 mg/kg. Crops subjected to the described procedure included lettuce, strawberry, apple, yellow pepper and peach, and gave extracts containing a mass of co-extractives between 5 and 30 mg.

The flavonoid content of vegetables, fruits, and beverages was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. In all subjects, average intake of all flavonoids combined was 23 mg/day. The most important flavonoid was the flavonol quercetin (mean intake 16 mg/day). The most important sources of flavonoids were tea (48% of total intake), onions (29%), and apples (7%). Flavonoid intake did not vary between seasons; it was not correlated with total energy intake (r = 0.001), and it was only weakly correlated with the intake of vitamin A (retinol equivalents, r = 0.14), dietary fiber (r = 0.21), and vitamin C (r = 0.26). Our use of new analytic technology suggests that in the past flavonoid intake has been overestimated fivefold.

Following separation by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, ten tryptic peptides were sequenced. Based on the sequences of three tryptic peptides, three sets of mixed oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and used to screen a plasmid cDNA library prepared from poly(A)(+) RNA of ripe apple fruit. A 1.5-kb (kilobase) cDNA clone which hybridized to all three probes were isolated. The clone contained an open reading frame of 1214 base pairs (bp) encoding a sequence of 404 amino acids. While the polyadenine tail at the 3'-end was intact, it lacked a portion of sequence at the 5'-end. Using the RNA-based polymerase chain reaction, an additional sequence of 148 bp was obtained at the 5'-end. Thus, 1362 bp were sequenced and they encode 454 amino acids. The deduced amino-acid sequence contained peptide sequences corresponding to all ten tryptic fragments, confirming the identity of the cDNA clone. Comparison of the deduced amino-acid sequence between ACC synthase from apple fruit and those from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and winter squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) fruits demonstrated the presence of seven highly conserved regions, including the previously identified region for the active site. The size of the translation product of ACC-synthase mRNA was similar to that of the mature protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), indicating that apple ACC-synthase undergoes only minor, if any, post-translational proteolytic processing. Analysis of ACC-synthase mRNA by in-vitro translation-immunoprecipitation, and by Northern blotting indicates that the ACC-synthase mRNA was undetectable in unripe fruit, but was accumulated massively during the ripening proccess.

16667601,"Previous (18)O labeling studies of abscisic acid (ABA) have shown that apple (Malus domestica Borkh. cv Granny Smith) fruits synthesize a majority of [(18)O]ABA with the label incorporated in the 1'-hydroxyl position and unlabeled in the carboxyl group (JAD Zeevaart, TG Heath, DA Gage [1989] Plant Physiol 91: 1594-1601). It was proposed that exchange of (18)O in the side chain with the medium occurred at an aldehyde intermediate stage of ABA biosynthesis. We have isolated ABA-aldehyde and 1'-4'-trans-ABA-diol (ABA-trans-diol) from (18)O-labeled apple fruit tissue and measured the extent and position of (18)O incorporation by tandem mass spectrometry. (18)O-Labeling patterns of ABA-aldehyde, ABA-trans-diol, and ABA indicate that ABA-aldehyde is a precursor to, and ABA-trans-diol a catabolite of, ABA. Exchange of (18)O in the carbonyl of ABA-aldehyde can be the cause of loss of (18)O from the side chain of [(18)O]ABA. Results of feeding experiments with deuterated substrates provide further support for the precursor-product relationship of ABA-aldehyde --> ABA --> ABA-trans-diol. The ABA-aldehyde and ABA-trans-diol contents of fruits and leaves were low, approximately 1 and 0.02 nanograms per gram fresh weight for ABA-aldehyde and ABA-trans-diol, respectively, while ABA levels in fruits ranged from 10 to 200 nanograms per gram fresh weight. ABA biosynthesis was about 10-fold lower in fruits than in leaves. In fruits, the majority of ABA was conjugated to beta-d-glucopyranosyl abscisate, whereas in leaves ABA was mainly hydroxylated to phaseic acid.

Foods 1-4 were fortified with ferrous sulfate, and food 5 was fortified with ferrous fumarate. Blood was obtained at ages 140, 168, and 196 d of age, and the test meal was fed under standardized conditions at 154 d of age. Erythrocyte incorporation of the 58Fe label was determined from the increase in the mass isotope ratio, 58Fe/57Fe, from the baseline value (at 140 d of age) to the follow-up values. The mass isotope ratio was determined by inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Geometric mean total iron incorporation into erythrocytes from the test meal of MJEBF fortified with ferrous sulfate (food 2) was 0.05 mg, and from the vegetable-beef product test meal (food 3) was 0.08 mg. The low value for MJEBF is presumably explained by the low level of iron fortification. The low value for the vegetable-beef product may reflect the presence of inhibitors of iron absorption. Geometric mean erythrocyte incorporations of iron from the test meals with foods 1, 4 and 5 were 0.15, 0.14, and 0.18 mg, respectively.

2518628,"This study pursued the isolation and partial characterization of the enzyme polyphenoloxidase from apple (Malus domestica Anna variety), grown in the Hermosillo Coast (State of Sonora, Mexico). The effects of pH and temperature as well as its specificity towards substrates, and its behavior under conditions of hydrophobic chromatography, were studied. The enzyme was isolated from a residual powder obtained from ripe apples homogenized with cold acetone. The extract thus prepared was used to characterize the enzyme, and it showed an optimum pH of 5.36 and an optimum temperature of 35 degrees C. The substrate specificity proved to decrease from 4-methyl catechol, chlorogenic acid, catechol, and caffeic acid, to 3,4-dihydroxiphenyl alanine (DOPA). The enzyme resulted to be more thermostable (temperature range: 35 degrees C to 60 degrees C) than the rest of oxidases of plant origin. When the extract was eluted under conditions of hydrophobic chromatography separation, it appeared as a single peak resulting in a 300 fold purification. The phenolase activity characteristics found in the present study were similar to those observed in other apples from temperate climates; however, this particular polyphenoloxidase is more thermostable under natural conditions. This explains why apples of the Anna variety, at the high harvesting temperature, show a very fast formation of brown spots even when there is a minor damage.

Excellent agreement, with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.99, was observed in fresh potato samples homogenized with sulfite and allowed to react for different time intervals (enzymatic browning system). A good overall correlation was observed in dehydrated, sulfited apple samples heated for different times (nonenzymatic browning system); however, as heating time increased, higher results were obtained by the Monier-Williams method than by the alkali extraction/ion exclusion chromatographic method. The results of determining sulfite in the alkali trapping solution following acid distillation or acid treatment without heat suggested that this deviation was due to a fraction of sulfite bound to the browning reaction products in such a way that it was released by acid distillation but not by alkali extraction or acid treatment without heat. Similar behavior was demonstrated in cabbage with naturally occurring sulfite, which was released by acid distillation but not by alkali extraction or acid treatment without heat.

Golden Delicious) individually or as part of a standard treatment program where it was applied eight times during the growing season together with several pesticides. Leaf samples (100 discs of 2.2 cm diameter) were collected from treated and control trees before treatment and at 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, 90 and 112 days after treatment. Fruit samples were taken at mid-season (56 days) and at harvest (112 days). The objective of this study was to determine the captan residue and mutagenicity of leaf and fruit extracts to ascertain the potential health hazard to agricultural workers in these orchards. Surface residues were extracted from leaves and fruits with methylene chloride. These extracts were subsequently analyzed for captan by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) utilizing an electron-capture detector, and for mutagenicity with two strains (TA98 and TA100) of Salmonella typhimurium, with and without microsomal enzyme activation. Positive mutagenic effects were observed with strain TA100 at 0-14 days post spray, even with extracts from one leaf disc's surface (3.8 cm2) of the single treatment. Captan residues in these samples indicated a decline from 9.3 micrograms/cm2 at 0 days to 0.80 micrograms/cm2 at 14 days and a trace after 112 days. With the standard treatment, in which captan was incorporated eight times in the program starting at the 7-day interval, leaf extracts showed mutagenic activity at 7, 14, 28 and 90 days. Captan residues at these intervals were 11.4, 5.0, 4.1 and 3.4 micrograms/cm2, respectively. Fruit sample extracts of the standard spray were mutagenic to the tester strains TA100 and TA98 both at mid-season and at harvest. Residues of captan on fruits declined from 10.4 micrograms/cm2 at mid-season to 1.1 micrograms/cm2 at harvest.

The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little.

The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts.

Conjugates of ABA, were quantified after alkaline hydrolysis. The validity of the radioimmunoassay was tested by comparison of immunoassay estimates of ABA at different levels of extract purity with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antiserum, raised against (+)-ABA, was almost equally sensitive to (-)-ABA. Serum cross-reactivity with the methyl ester of ABA was 160% and with the glycosyl ester of ABA was 34%. Cross-reactivity with protein-ABA conjugates was very slight for C'4-conjugated keyholelimpet haemocyanin, but about 1000% for C1-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Other compounds tested showed extremely low or undetectable cross-reactivities. Further evidence for the specificity of the assay came from the agreement between the results using different assay methods for both apple and pepper extracts, and from the observation that the only zone of immunoreactivity on HPLC elution profiles corresponded with authentic (+)-ABA. The use of polyvinylpyrrolidone in the assay minimised interference by other substances in plant extracts. In pepper, free ABA levels increased rapidly during water stress and recovered to pre-stress levels within two days after rewatering. Levels of ABA conjugates were significantly lowr than free ABA in unstressed plants, and also increased rapidly with stress, although not to the same extent as free ABA, and did not recover as rapidly as did free ABA. In apple, levels of free ABA and of ABA conjugates both increased more than twofold over a two-week period of water stress. In contrast to pepper, however, immunoreactivity of the conjugate fraction was increased by hydrolysis, indicating that different ABA conjugates predominate in the two species.

The latter two fractions accounted for over 70% of the total hydroxyproline. 3. Methylation analysis was used to show that the triarabinoside contained only 1-->2-linkages between sugars, but that the tetra-arabinoside contained both 1-->2- and 1-->3-linkages. Direct-insertion mass spectrometry of these compounds using electron impact and chemical ionization, in a comparison with other known structural patterns, was used to determine the sequences of the sugars, which were Araf1-->2Araf1-->2Araf1-->Hyp and Araf1-->3Araf1-->2Araf1-->2Araf 1-->Hyp. 4. On the basis of optical rotation it had previously been suggested [Allen, Desai, Neuberger & Creeth (1978) Biochem. J.171, 665-674] that all the arabinose of potato lectin was present as the beta-l-furanoside. However, measurement of the optical rotations of the hydroxyprolyl arabinosides showed that whereas the diarabinoside had a molar rotation ([m]) value close to that predicted, the triarabinoside was more dextrorotatory and the tetra-arabinoside was less dextrorotatory than expected. Possible explanations for these findings are that, although the di- and tri-arabinosides contain exclusively beta-arabinofuranosides, in the tri-arabinoside, interactions between pentose units lead to an enhanced positive rotation. The tetra-arabinoside, however, is proposed to contain a single alpha-arabinofuranoside residue, which is responsible for the lower than expected positive rotation. The observed rotation of the tetra-arabinoside was found to be close to the theoretical value predicted on that basis. Furthermore, the action of a specific alpha-arabinofuranosidase on the tetrasaccharide was to remove a single arabinose residue, presumably the terminal non-reducing sugar, and to produce a product that was indistinguishable on electrophoresis from the triarabinoside. Changes in rotation were compatible with this assumption. 5. It is concluded that the structures of the hydroxyprolyl tri- and tetra-arabinosides of potato lectin are: betaAraf1-->2betaAraf1-->2betaAraf1-->Hyp and alphaAraf1-->3betaAraf1-->2betaAraf 1-->2betaAraf1-->Hyp.

16661565,"A major protease present in dormant bark tissues of the apple (Malus domestica Borkh. cv. ""Golden Delicious"") was partially purified by hemoglobin-coupled Sepharose column chromatography. The protease active at pH 4.6 and at temperatures of 30 to 50 C was found to be sulfhydryl-dependent. Phenylmercuric acetate inhibited the enzyme approximately 50% at 2 millimolar, whereas phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited less than 30% even at 10 millimolar. Substrate specificity and the separation of the enzyme reaction products indicated that the enzyme is likely to be an endoprotease. We suggest that the storage proteins in apple bark tissue undergo some modification prior to their eventual hydrolysis to amino acids, which requires a multi-enzyme system(s). Evidence is presented that the apple bark protein extracts enzymically release ninhydrin-positive compounds upon storage at 5 C.

Using these levels and the estimated average intake of these foods, authors computed an individual's average daily consumption of pesticides from each of these food groups and her/his total diet. Foods were acquired over a 1-year period from the market of Valencia, a city that gets supplies from an agricultural area where pesticide consumption is appreciably higher than that of the rest of the country. Thus average residue levels found must be higher than the national average. Except for fruits and vegetables, the different items composing each food group were sampled in proportion to the amount consumed in the average Spanish diet. Foods forming each group were homogenized into composite samples. All foods were analyzed raw. The most frequently detected pesticides were DDT and BHC. Malathion was detected at levels less than 0.10 ppm in some samples of vegetable oils, pears, and apples. DDT and BHC levels varied from undetectable to amounts less than 1.0 ppm.

After extraction with methanol, 2 separate methylation procedures were required to quantitatively convert each compound. Ethephon was esterified with diazomethane and analyzed by a flame photometric detector in the P-mode. Fenoprop was esterified with boron trifluoride/methanol and analyzed by electron capture gas chromatography. Average recoveries were about 95% at 0.05 ppm for both compounds. The limit of detection was 0.05 ppm for ethephon and 0.01 ppm for fenoprop in a 1 g sample. The persistence of both compounds before and after harvest was studied. Ethephon and fenoprop were applied simultaneously to apple trees at the recommended concentrations of 300 and 20 ppm, respectively. Ethephon residues averaged 1.6, 0.75, and 0.4 ppm at 2 hr, 10 days, and after washing at 13 days, respectively.

958361,"Various authors have defined organoleptically the concept ""cooking flavour"" for heat-treated apple juice and concentrate. In a similar way, the ""irradiation flavour"" caused by gamma radiation is defined in the present paper. It has been found that the irradiation flavour is attributable to low-boiling substances which appear already in the first fraction if the modified MICKO distillation is performed. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) has been identified as the key substance in irradiation flavour. As further evidence may be quoted the similarity of the intensity of off-flavour which was observed also by gas chromatography at the same times of retention, and the removal of the irradiation flavour by means of a THF-specific agent (mercury acetate). In connection with THF solutions added to non-irradiated apple juice, the authors employed the technique of ""subjective olfactometry"", using the ""absolute value scale"", to establish mathematical correlations between the intensity of irradiation flavour and the concentration of off-flavour products in apple juice or concentrate. The dependence of the intensity of irradiation flavour on the THF concentration and the gamma radiation dose, respectively, obeyed an exponential function. Thus, it has been possible to calculate the amounts of THF formed by radiation doses varying from 0.64 to 2.55 Mrad. Furthermore, the authors determined the minimum radiation dose for 12% apple juice and for 67% apple concentrate at which the irradiation flavour is first perceived (treshold of perception).",Die Nahrung,"['D003037', 'D004307', 'D005514', 'D005638', 'D005663', 'D009812', 'D011830', 'D013649']","['Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Food Irradiation', 'Fruit', 'Furans', 'Odorants', 'Radiation Effects', 'Taste']",[New methods for evaluation and analysis of organoleptic qualities of foods and for calculation of changes. 9.

14340052,"1. The pectic substances of apple have been extracted and separated into a pure pectinic acid and a neutral arabinan-galactan complex by precipitation of the acidic component with ethanol and with cetylpyridinium chloride. 2. The composition of the fractions has been determined. The pectinic acid contained galacturonic acid, arabinose, galactose, rhamnose, xylose and several trace sugars. 3. Transelimination degradation of the pectinic acid gave rise to two components completely separable by zone electrophoresis and by Sephadex gel filtration. Analysis of these components confirmed that the pectinic acid molecules contained long chains of esterified galacturonosyl residues, but showed in addition that more neutral portions containing a high proportion of arabinofuranose residues were attached to them. 4. The identification of rhamnose, galactose and xylose in aldobiouronic acids obtained from a partial hydrolysate of pectinic acid has shown that these sugars are covalently linked in the molecule, and it is suggested that the galacturonosyl-(1-->2)-rhamnose link is a general feature of pectinic acid structure. 5.
