34124115,"Regional differences were found in breast milk composition. This study intended to profile the composition of fatty acid (FA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) in Chinese breast milk and to explore its association with maternal diet. Breast milk samples and data of 52 lactating women at 60-90 days postpartum were collected. The FA composition was measured using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID), and the TAG profile was detected by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography system, coupled with accurate-mass quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. A semi-quantitative food intake frequency questionnaire and a one-time 24-h dietary recall were used to evaluate the previous month's and the short-term dietary intake, including dietary patterns, food groups, and nutrients. Oleic-palmitic-linoleic (OPL) is the most predominant TAG within the Chinese human milk, followed by oleic-palmitic-oleic (OPO), with an average OPL-to-OPO ratio of 1.35. Linoleic acid (LA) and oleic acid (OA) accounted for 23.9 and 32.0% of the total FAs, respectively. Among the food groups consumed during the preceding month, LA content was positively associated with the consumption of soybeans and soybean products (",Frontiers in nutrition,[],[],Chinese Breast Milk Fat Composition and Its Associated Dietary Factors: A Pilot Study on Lactating Mothers in Beijing.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124115,2021
29146360,"This work aimed at investigating the behaviour of Trolox, vitamin E analogue, in presence of macromolecule-bound antioxidants in aqueous radical medium. Three main groups of macromolecule-bound antioxidants were assayed: dietary fiber (DF), protein and lipid-bound antioxidants, represented by whole wheat, soybean and olive oil products, respectively. Experimental studies were carried out in aqueous ABTS (2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) radical medium. Trolox and macromolecule-bound antioxidants were added to radical separately and together in different concentrations. Antioxidant capacities were determined using QUENCHER procedure. pH of radical media was altered for DF and protein-bound antioxidant studies to examine its effect. Chemometric tools were used for experimental design and multivariate data analysis. Results revealed antagonistic interactions for Trolox with all macromolecule-bound antioxidants. The reason behind this antagonism was investigated through oxidation reactions of Trolox via mass spectrometry analysis. Consequently, a proof was obtained for inhibitory effect of bound-antioxidants on auto-regeneration reactions of Trolox.",Food chemistry,"['D000975', 'D052160', 'D002839', 'D000069463', 'D010084', 'D010940', 'D013025', 'D013451', 'D014908', 'D014810']","['Antioxidants', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Chromans', 'Olive Oil', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Plant Proteins', 'Soybeans', 'Sulfonic Acids', 'Triticum', 'Vitamin E']",Behaviour of Trolox with macromolecule-bound antioxidants in aqueous medium: Inhibition of auto-regeneration mechanism.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000031']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analogs & derivatives']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146360,2018
26149112,"The probe electrospray ionization (PESI) is an ESI-based ionization technique that generates electrospray from the tip of a solid metal needle. In the present work, we describe the PESI mass spectra obtained by in situ measurement of soybeans and several nuts (peanuts, walnuts, cashew nuts, macadamia nuts and almonds) using different solid needles as sampling probes. It was found that PESI-MS is a valuable approach for in situ lipid analysis of these seeds. The phospholipid and triacylglycerol PESI spectra of different nuts and soybean were compared by principal component analysis (PCA). PCA shows significant differences among the data of each family of seeds. Methanolic extracts of nuts and soybean were exposed to air and sunlight for several days. PESI mass spectra were recorded before and after the treatment. Along the aging of the oil (rancidification), the formation of oxidated species with variable number of hydroperoxide groups could be observed in the PESI spectra. The relative intensity of oxidated triacylglycerols signals increased with days of exposition. Monitoring sensitivity of PESI-MS was high.

25463210,"In most cases of mycotoxin detection, quantitation is critical while immunochromatographic strip tests are qualitative in nature. Moreover, the sensitivity of this technique is questioned. In order to overcome these limitations, an ultrasensitive and quantitative immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for rapid and sensitive quantitation of ochratoxin A (OTA) was developed. The assay was based on a competitive format and its sensitivity was improved by using a sensitive and selective OTA monoclonal antibody (OTA-mAb). The visible ICA results were obtained within 15 min, and in addition to visual examination, they were read by the rapid color intensity portable strip reader. The visual and computational detection limits (vLOD and cLOD, respectively) for ochratoxin A were 0.2 and 0.25 ng mL(-1), respectively. These values were lower than those reported by previous studies in a range 5-2500 folds. For validation, contaminated samples including wheat, maize, rice and soybean were assayed by ICA and a standard high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results were in good agreement for both ICA and HPLC methods. The average recoveries of the HPLC were in the range 72-120% while the ICA values were from 76 to 104%, confirming the accuracy and sensitivity of this method.","Journal of chromatography.

22969785,"Soybean (Glycinemax) is a hugely valuable soft commodity that generates tens of billions of dollars annually. This value is due in part to the balanced composition of the seed which is roughly 1:2:2 oil, starch, and protein by weight. In turn, the seeds have many uses with various derivatives appearing broadly in processed food products. As is true with many edible seeds, soybeans contain proteins that are anti-nutritional factors and allergens. Soybean, along with milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and wheat, elicit a majority of food allergy reactions in the United States. Soybean seed composition can be affected by breeding, and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture, insect/pathogen load, and/or soil nutrient levels). The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of genotype and environment on allergen and anti-nutritional proteins in soybean. To address genetic and environmental effects, four varieties of non-GM soybeans were grown in six geographically distinct regions of North America (Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Ontario, and Pennsylvania). Absolute quantification of proteins by mass spectrometry can be achieved with a technique called multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), during which signals from an endogenous protein are compared to those from a synthetic heavy-labeled internal standard. Using MRM, eight allergens were absolutely quantified for each variety in each environment. Statistical analyses show that for most allergens, the effects of environment far outweigh the differences between varieties brought about by breeding.",Frontiers in plant science,[],[],Environmental effects on allergen levels in commercially grown non-genetically modified soybeans: assessing variation across north america.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22969785,2012
17995672,"Oxidation of corn oil during frying of soy-flour-added dough was studied. Flour dough containing soy flour at 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% was fried in corn oil at 180 degrees C for 2.5 min, and a total of 60 fryings were performed every 30 min. The oxidation of oil was determined by contents of free fatty acids (FFA), conjugated dienoic acids (CDA), polar compounds, and p-anisidine values (PAV). Tocopherols and phospholipids (PLs) in the oil were determined by HPLC. Tocopherols were present in corn oil at 1000 ppm before frying and increased after the first frying of dough containing soy flour due to tocopherol transfer from soy-flour-added dough to the oil during frying. However, as the oil repeated frying, tocopherol contents decreased and its degradation rate was higher in the oil that fried soy-flour-added dough than in the oil that fried the dough without soy flour. PL was not detected in corn oil before and after frying. As the oil repeated frying, FFA, CDA, and polar compounds contents, and PAV of frying oil increased due to the oil oxidation. The values were higher in the oil which fried soy-flour-added dough than in the oil fried the dough without soy flour, indicating the acceleration of oil oxidation by soy flour added to dough.

The end product of fermentation was mainly lactic acid (4-8 g/l of intestinal contents), and the pH values of the large intestine contents were low (4.0-4.9), but these fermentations did not cause digestive problems, such as diarrhea, probably because the amount of soya carbohydrates in the food was low, and the digestive processes along the digestive tract were very regular.","Reproduction, nutrition, developpement","['D000375', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D003106', 'D004040', 'D004063', 'D005243', 'D005285', 'D005697', 'D007082', 'D007413', 'D013025', 'D013395']","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Colon', 'Dietary Carbohydrates', 'Digestion', 'Feces', 'Fermentation', 'Galactosides', 'Ileum', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Soybeans', 'Sucrose']",[Qualitative aspects of intestinal digestion of soybean cake carbohydrates in the preruminant calf].,"[None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'physiology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6891484,1983
1170165,"A thin layer chromatographic cleanup development with benzene-hexane (3+1) effectively removed lipids and some contaminants from mixtures of mycotoxins in corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and seed extracts. A second development in the same direction as the first, using toluene-ethyl acetate-formic acid (6+3+1) or benzene-acetic acid (9+1), separated the mycotoxins. Satisfactory separation was achieved for commercial oils spiked with sterigmatocystin, zearalenone, ochratoxins A, B, and C, and aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2.

4796163,"The ability of 88 fungi, which had been obtained as high-potency strains for acid proteinase production, to produce a new type of acid carboxypeptidase (having on optimal pH of about 3 for hydrolysis of benzyloxycarbonyl-glutamyltyrosine) in surface koji culture was determined. Among the aspergilli, substantial amounts of this new acid carboxypeptidase were produced by Aspergillus saitoi, A. usamii, A. awamori, A. inuii, and A. niger. Maximum yields of acid carboxypeptidase per gram of substrate were obtained by submerged culture in a medium containing 0.9% defatted soybean and 0.6% wheat bran. However, the maximum enzyme concentration per milliliter was obtained with a medium containing 3% defatted soybean and 2% wheat bran. The terminal pH could be controlled by varying the concentrations of soybean oil meal and wheat bran.
