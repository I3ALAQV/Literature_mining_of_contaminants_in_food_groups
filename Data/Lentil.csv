34201792,"Pulse crop seed coats are a sustainable source of antioxidant polyphenols, but are typically treated as low-value products, partly because some polyphenols reduce iron bioavailability in humans. This study correlates antioxidant/iron chelation capabilities of diverse seed coat types from five major pulse crops (common bean, lentil, pea, chickpea and faba bean) with polyphenol composition using mass spectrometry. Untargeted metabolomics was used to identify key differences and a hierarchical analysis revealed that common beans had the most diverse polyphenol profiles among these pulse crops. The highest antioxidant capacities were found in seed coats of black bean and all tannin lentils, followed by maple pea, however, tannin lentils showed much lower iron chelation among these seed coats. Thus, tannin lentils are more desirable sources as natural antioxidants in food applications, whereas black bean and maple pea are more suitable sources for industrial applications. Regardless of pulse crop, proanthocyanidins were primary contributors to antioxidant capacity, and to a lesser extent, anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols, whereas glycosylated flavonols contributed minimally. Higher iron chelation was primarily attributed to proanthocyanidin composition, and also myricetin 3-","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000975', 'D044946', 'D001682', 'D002392', 'D029863', 'D000078331', 'D005419', 'D044948', 'D020128', 'D007502', 'D027806', 'D013058', 'D055432', 'D010636', 'D059808', 'D044945', 'D012639', 'D013634', 'D031307']","['Antioxidants', 'Biflavonoids', 'Biological Availability', 'Catechin', 'Cicer', 'Correlation of Data', 'Flavonoids', 'Flavonols', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lens Plant', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolomics', 'Phenols', 'Polyphenols', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Seeds', 'Tannins', 'Vicia faba']",An Untargeted Metabolomics Approach for Correlating Pulse Crop Seed Coat Polyphenol Profiles with Antioxidant Capacity and Iron Chelation Ability.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201792,2021

32854310,"Food allergies are a global food challenge. For correct food labelling, the detection and quantification of allergens are necessary. However, novel product formulations and industrial processes produce new scenarios, which require much more technological developments. For this purpose, OMICS technologies, especially proteomics, seemed to be relevant in this context. This review summarises the current knowledge and studies that used proteomics to study food allergens. In the case of the allergenic proteins, a wide variety of isoforms, post-translational modifications and other structural changes during food processing can increase or decrease the allergenicity. Most of the plant-based food allergens are proteins with biological functions involved in storage, structure, and plant defence. The allergenicity of these proteins could be increased by the presence of heavy metals, air pollution, and pesticides. Targeted proteomics like selected/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) have been very useful, especially in the case of gluten from wheat, rye and barley, and allergens from lentil, soy, and fruit. Conventional 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting have been further widely used. For animal-based food allergens, the widely used technologies are 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF, and more recently LC-MS/MS, which is becoming useful to assess egg, fish, or milk allergens. The detection and quantification of allergenic proteins using mass spectrometry-based proteomics are promising and would contribute to greater accuracy, therefore improving consumer information.",Biology,[],[],Current Trends in Proteomic Advances for Food Allergen Analysis.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854310,2020

The present research is focused on the As transport in different lentil genotypes and the role of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) in mitigation of As phyto-toxicity. Arsenic transport from soil to root, shoot and grains in different lentil genotypes was analyzed by flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrophotometry. AMF were applied for the reduction of As uptake as well as the improvement of plant growth in lentil genotypes. Arsenic phyto-toxicity was dose-dependent as evidenced by relatively higher shoot length, fresh and dry weight of root and shoot in 5 and 15 mgkg-1 As-treated lentil plants than that in 100 mgkg-1 As-treated lentil. Arsenic accumulation occurred in roots and shoots of all BARI-released lentil genotypes. Arsenic accumulation in grains was found higher in BARI Mashur 1 than other lentil genotypes. AMF treatment significantly increased growth and biomass accumulation in lentil compared to that in non-AMF plants. Furthermore, AMF effectively reduced the As concentrations in roots and shoots of lentil plants grown at 8 and 45 mgkg-1 As-contaminated soils. This study revealed remarkable divergence in As accumulation among different BARI-released lentil genotypes; however, AMF could reduce As uptake and mitigate As-induced phyto-toxicity in lentil.

To circumvent the principal barrier of serum proteomics, our investigation aimed to evaluate whether a study of post-translational modification enriched serum proteins could be valuable for the discovery of biomarkers or metabolic pathways related to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Type 2 diabetes was induced from high-fat diet fed Sprague Dawley rats with streptozotocin injection. Once diabetic status was confirmed, serum samples from either fasted healthy or diabetic rats were pooled and profiled by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis or comparative 2D electrophoresis after protein enrichments using immobilized metal ion, concanavalin A, and lentil affinity chromatography, respectively. Differential expressed proteins were identified and the associated networks were established by an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. As a result, induced rats became severe diabetic and accompanied by hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and glomerular hypertrophy. There were 3 total, 14 phosphorylated and 23 glycosylated protein targets differentially expressed. Proteins could be linked to HNF4A, HNF1A, and NFκB transcriptional factors and antigen presentation, humoral immune response, and inflammatory response pathways.

30052442,"Grass pea, a protein-rich, high-yielding, and drought-tolerant legume, is used as food and livestock feed in several tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The abundant seed proteins of grass pea are salt-soluble globulins, which can be separated into vicilins and legumins. In many other legumes, the members of vicilin seed proteins have been identified as major allergens. However, very little information is available on the allergens of grass pea. In this study, we have identified an abundant 47 kDa protein from grass pea, which was recognized by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies from sera drawn from several peanut-allergic patients. The IgE-binding 47 kDa protein was partially purified by affinity chromatography on a Con-A sepharose column. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the 47 kDa grass pea protein revealed sequence homology to 47 kDa vicilin from pea and Len c 1 from lentil. Interestingly the grass pea vicilin was found to be susceptible to pepsin digestion in vitro.

27108990,"Soybean is a common allergenic food; thus, a comprehensive characterization of all the proteins that cause allergy is crucial to the development of effective diagnostic and immunotherapeutic strategies. A cDNA library was constructed from seven stages of developing soybean seeds to investigate candidate allergens. We searched the library for cDNAs encoding a seed-specific biotinylated protein (SBP) based on its allergenicity in boiled lentils. A full-length cDNA clone was retrieved and expressed as a 75.6-kDa His-tagged recombinant protein (rSBP) in Escherichia coli. Western immunoblotting of boiled bacterial extracts demonstrated specific IgE binding to rSBP, which was further purified by metal affinity and anion exchange chromatographies. Of the 23 allergic sera screened by ELISA, 12 contained IgEs specific to the purified rSBP. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a predominantly unordered structure consistent with SBP's heat stability. The natural homologues (nSBP) were the main proteins isolated from soybean and peanut embryos after streptavidin affinity purification, yet they remained low-abundance proteins in the seed as confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Using capture ELISAs, the soybean and peanut nSBPs were bound by IgEs in 78 and 87% of the allergic sera tested. The soybean nSBP was purified to homogeneity and treatments with different denaturing agents before immunoblotting highlighted the diversity of its IgE epitopes. In vitro activation of basophils was assessed by flow cytometry in a cohort of peanut-allergic children sensitized to soybean. Stronger and more frequent (38%) activations were induced by nSBP-soy compared to the major soybean allergen, Gly m 5.

26635049,"Peanut, soybean, sesame and lentil are members of legumes worldwide consumed by human that can induce food allergy in genetically predisposed individuals. Several protein allergens, mainly water-soluble, have been described. We studied the non water-soluble fraction from these 4 food sources using immunoproteomics tools and techniques. Flour extracts were solubilized in detergent and chaotropes and analysed in 1 and 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D). Results showed numerous proteins exhibiting wide ranges of isoelectric points and relative molecular masses. When IgE immunoreactivities of 18 food allergy patients were individually tested in 1 and 2D western-blots, a very diversified IgE repertoire was observed, reflecting extensive cross-reactivities but also co-sensitizations. Besides already well known and characterized allergens, mass spectrometry analysis allowed the identification of 22 allergens undescribed until now: 10 in peanut, 2 in soybean, 3 in sesame and 7 in lentil. Three allergens are legume storage proteins and the others belong to transport proteins, nucleotide binding proteins and proteins involved in the regulation of metabolism. Seven proteins are potentially similar to allergens described in plants and fungi and 11 are not related to any known allergen. Our results contribute to increase the repertoire of legume allergens that may improve the diagnosis, categorize patients and thus provide a better treatment of patients.

25956648,"The present work report the unusual uranium uptake by foodstuff, especially those rich in carbohydrates like rice when they are cooked in water, contaminated with uranium. The major staple diet in South Asia, rice, was chosen to study its interaction with UO2(2+), the active uranium species in water, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Highest uptake limit was checked by cooking rice at very high uranium concentration and it was found to be good scavenger of uranium. To gain insight into the mechanism of uptake, direct interaction of UO2(2+) with monosaccharides was also studied, using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry taking mannose as a model. The studies have been done with dissolved uranium salt, uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UO2(NO3)2·6H2O), as well as the leachate of a stable oxide of uranium, UO2(s), both of which exist as UO2(2+) in water. Among the eight different rice varieties investigated, Karnataka Ponni showed the maximum uranium uptake whereas unpolished Basmati rice showed the minimum. Interaction with other foodstuffs (potato, carrot, peas, kidney beans and lentils) with and without NaCl affected the extent of chemical interaction but was not consistent with the carbohydrate content. Uranium interaction with D-mannose monitored through ESI-MS, under optimized instrumental parameters, identified the peaks corresponding to uranyl adduct with mannose monomer, dimer and trimer and the species were confirmed by MS/MS studies. The product ion mass spectra showed peaks illustrating water loss from the parent ion as the collision energy was increased, an evidence for the strong interaction of uranium with mannose.

Chickpea is consumed in Mediterranean countries, and reportedly associated with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. However, the nature of allergic reactions to chickpea has not been characterized. A serum pool from paediatric patients allergic to chickpeas was used to detect IgE-binding proteins from chickpea seeds by immunoassay and immunoblot inhibition assay. Protein samples enriched in chickpea legumin and vicilin were obtained by anion exchange chromatography, and were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. IgE-immunoassays of globulin fractions from chickpeas revealed that vicilin (50 kDa) and the basic subunit of legumin (20 kDa) were bound by IgE from patient sera. Pea and lentil protein extracts strongly inhibited the IgE binding to chickpea globulin. We speculate that vicilin and the basic subunit of legumin are major chickpea allergens.

Use of this methodology for the extraction of natural occurring substances provides advantages such as simplicity and ease of use, especially taking into account the complexity of food matrices. The method was applied successfully for the determination of eight isoflavones, including aglycones and glucosides, in legumes of Spanish origin (chickpeas, lentils and beans from the region of Castilla y León). The target compounds were the glucosides daidzin, glycitin and genistin, and the aglycones daidzein, glycitein, genistein, formononetin, and biochanin A.

Because polyphenols in lentils are located essentially in their seed coat, the objective of this work was to study the composition of proanthocyanidins, the major group of polyphenols, in this part of the tissue. The use of C(18) Sep-Pak cartridges permitted the fractionation of lentil seed coat extract into monomer, oligomer, and polymer proanthocyanidin fractions. Subsequent thiolysis of oligomer and polymer fractions followed by HPLC analysis allowed the mean degree of polymerization (mDP) and the structural composition of proanthocyanidins to be determined. A fractionation of lentil seed coat extracts on a polyamide column followed by HPLC and HPLC-DAD-MS analyses was used to identify the individual proanthocyanidins. The results showed that the major monomeric flavan-3-ol was (+) catechin-3-glucose, with lesser amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. In the oligomer fraction, various dimer, trimer, and tetramer proanthocyanidins constituted of catechin, gallocatechin, and catechin gallate units were identified, and several procyanidins and prodelphinidins from pentamers to nonamers constitute the polymer fraction.

11386670,"Procyanidins are phenolic oligomers, mainly composed of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin units that exhibit certain sensorial and physiological properties of interest (e.g., astringency and bitterness of food, antioxidant activity, etc.). This paper shows the development of a micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method for the separation of three procyanidin dimers (B1, B2, and B3), their monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), and the cis- and trans-forms of p-coumaric acid. Separation conditions are optimized in terms of buffer pH, SDS concentration, and washing routine between injections. The best results in terms of peak resolution and reproducibility between separations were obtained with a MEKC running buffer at pH 5 with 100 mM SDS and a washing routine that includes a rinse step with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. Using this new MEKC method it is possible to separate in less than 5 min the seven substances. More interestingly, it is demonstrated that the low pH used in this MEKC method allows one to obtain clean electropherograms when samples are injected. The method is shown to be reproducible between different days with relative standard deviation (RSD) values lower than 1% for migration times and lower than 7% for peak areas (3 days, 24 injections). The usefulness of this procedure to determine these compounds in effluents from food processing (i.e., soaking water from lentils, white beans and black beans) and in food by-products (i.e., almond peels) considered as potential procyanidin sources is demonstrated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of separation and determination of procyanidins in food samples done by capillary electrophoresis.",Electrophoresis,"['D044946', 'D002392', 'D020374', 'D007887', 'D015394', 'D010636', 'D010946', 'D044945', 'D015203', 'D013997']","['Biflavonoids', 'Catechin', 'Chromatography, Micellar Electrokinetic Capillary', 'Fabaceae', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phenols', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Time Factors']",Fast determination of procyanidins and other phenolic compounds in food samples by micellar electrokinetic chromatography using acidic buffers.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11386670,2001
11087482,"An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and most of the berries.

Non-desmosomal plasma membranes enriched in plasma-membrane marker enzymes and in metabolically labelled glycoproteins were isolated on a large scale from up to 500g of pig ear skin slices. Sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and periodic acid/Schiff staining revealed the presence of four major glycosylated components in the apparent molecular-weight range 150000-80000. 2. A large proportion of the marker enzymes, the d-[(3)H]glucosamine-labelled glycoproteins and the periodic acid/Schiff-stained glycoproteins were solubilized by 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. However, several non-glycosylated proteins, in particular those with mol.wts. 81000, 41000 and 38000 (possibly cytoskeletal components), were relatively resistant to solubilization. 3. The deoxycholate-solubilized membranes were fractionated by lectin affinity chromatography using both concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B and lentil lectin-Sepharose 4B. From 75 to 85% of the applied glycoprotein was recovered from the columns. From 30 to 40% of the recovered glycoprotein was specifically bound by the lectins and was eluted with 2% (w/v) alpha-methyl d-mannoside. The enrichment of labelled glycoproteins in the material bound by the lectins (2.5-fold) was similar with both lectins, although the yield was somewhat greater when lentil lectin was used. The glycoprotein-enriched fraction was also enriched in all the plasma-membrane marker enzymes, indicating their probable glycoprotein nature. 4. The glycoprotein-enriched fraction contained the four major periodic acid/Schiff-stained bands that were detected in the original plasma membrane. They had apparent mol.wts. 147000, 130500, 108000 and 91400. The higher-molecular-weight components contained relatively more d-[(3)H]glucosamine, indicating differences in the sugar composition or in the metabolic turnover of the individual glycoproteins in culture. The material bound by the lectins also contained a number of lower-molecular-weight Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained components. These were weakly stained by periodic acid/Schiff reagent and were lightly labelled with d-[(3)H]glucosamine, indicating that they contained less carbohydrate than the four major glycoprotein bands. 5. Chloroform/methanol-extracted plasma membranes and isolated glycoproteins had a similar carbohydrate composition, containing sialic acid, hexosamine, fucose, xylose, mannose, galactose and glucose. Glucose was not enriched in the isolated glycoproteins, suggesting that it may be a contaminant. Xylose, however, was enriched in the isolated glycoproteins.
