35277064,"It is unclear how vegetarian dietary patterns influence plasma metabolites involved in biological processes regulating chronic diseases. We sought to identify plasma metabolic profiles distinguishing vegans (avoiding meat, eggs, dairy) from non-vegetarians (consuming ≥28 g/day red meat) of the Adventist Health Study-2 cohort using global metabolomics profiling with ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Differences in abundance of metabolites or biochemical subclasses were analyzed using linear regression models, adjusting for surrogate and confounding variables, with cross-validation to simulate results from an independent sample. Random forest was used as a learning tool for classification, and principal component analysis was used to identify clusters of related metabolites. Differences in covariate-adjusted metabolite abundance were identified in over 60% of metabolites (586/930), after adjustment for false discovery. The vast majority of differentially abundant metabolites or metabolite subclasses showed lower abundance in vegans, including xanthine, histidine, branched fatty acids, acetylated peptides, ceramides, and long-chain acylcarnitines, among others. Many of these metabolite subclasses have roles in insulin dysregulation, cardiometabolic phenotypes, and inflammation. Analysis of metabolic profiles in vegans and non-vegetarians revealed vast differences in these two dietary groups, reflecting differences in consumption of animal and plant products. These metabolites serve as biomarkers of food intake, many with potential pathophysiological consequences for cardiometabolic diseases.",Nutrients,"['D000818', 'D002853', 'D000067269', 'D014676', 'D006801', 'D055432', 'D053719', 'D000066989', 'D000066988']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Diet, Vegan', 'Diet, Vegetarian', 'Humans', 'Metabolomics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vegans', 'Vegetarians']",The Biology of Veganism: Plasma Metabolomics Analysis Reveals Distinct Profiles of Vegans and Non-Vegetarians in the Adventist Health Study-2 Cohort.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 'methods', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35277064,2022
35201367,"The design and production of incurred test materials are critical for the development and validation of methods for food allergen analysis. This is because production and processing conditions, together with the food matrix, can modify allergens affecting their structure, extractability and detectability. For the ThRAll project, which aims to develop a mass spectrometry-based reference method for the simultaneous accurate quantification of six allergenic ingredients in two hard to analyse matrices. Two highly processed matrices, chocolate bars and broth powder, were selected to incur with six allergenic ingredients (egg, milk, peanut, soy, hazelnut and almond) at 2, 4, 10 and 40 mg total allergenic protein/kg food matrix using a pilot-scale food manufacturing plant. The allergenic activity of the ingredients incurred was verified using food-allergic patient serum/plasma IgE, the homogeneity of the incurred matrices verified and their stability at 4 °C assessed over at least 30-month storage using appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Allergens were found at all levels from the chocolate bar and were homogenously distributed, apart from peanut and soy which could only be determined above 4 mg total allergenic ingredient protein/kg. The homogeneity assessment was restricted to analysis of soy, milk and peanut for the broth powder but nevertheless demonstrated that the allergens were homogeneously distributed.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC/MS) full scan analysis revealed that phthalic acid, isobutyl octyl ester (DEHP) and its metabolites were the main leachate from plastic bags. Our results demonstrated that during the eight weeks exposure, leaching from plastic bags treated with boiling water (P-high group) significantly affected the spawn egg production, embryo hatching and larval malformation rate. Cross-spawning trails between zebrafish collected from the controls and P-high group at the end of eight weeks showed that these adverse effects were more severe in the offspring derived from paternal exposure than those derived from the maternal exposure, suggesting leached chemicals may have a more pronounced effect in sperm than in eggs. In addition, P-high group male testis weight, sperm motility and sperm swimming velocities were decreased significantly. After eight weeks treatment, neurobehavioral tests demonstrated significant changes in the swimming speed during free swimming and light-dark stimulation in the adult zebrafish from P-high group, with the effects being more severe in the males than females.

34985214,"Chlorpropham is a plant growth regulator and a herbicide. It is commonly used in the post-harvest treatment of potato to inhibit germination. It can also be used for flower thinning and fruit thinning of fruit trees, and for controlling annual gramineous weeds and a few broad-leaved weeds. Improper or excessive use of chlorpropham in crop cultivation will affect the safety of animal-derived food and impair human health through the food chain and water cycle. Therefore, accurate quantification of chlorpropham is imperative for risk assessment and mitigating risks to food safety. A method based on solid phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS) was established for the determination of chlorpropham in animal-derived food. First, the pretreatment conditions were optimized. To purify the samples and remove impurities, SPE column cartridges with different packing materials such as PXC, PXA, Florisil, and PLS were investigated. Based on the retention of chlorpropham, the ProElut PLS SPE column was selected as the pretreatment purification column. The washing solution and eluents were then optimized. When water was used as the washing solution, chlorpropham remained adsorbed on the SPE column and was not eluted along with other water-soluble substances. When the proportion of acetonitrile exceeded 40%, chlorpropham adsorbed on the filler of the SPE column could be gradually washed down. Acetonitrile-water solution(30∶70, v/v) was used for washing the SPE column. The elution ability of seven eluents for chlorpropham on the SPE column was then investigated. Among them, pure methanol, pure acetonitrile, and 1% (v/v) formic acid-methanol showed better elution effect. Considering that acetonitrile was used in the sample extraction, it was chosen as the mobile phase eluent. Subsequently, the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters were optimized. By examining the ionization cracking of chlorpropham, the quasimolecular ions and corresponding fragmentations in the chlorpropham primary MS were determined. The separation effect of three C18 columns was investigated. Based on the retention ability and peak effect of chlorpropham on the column, the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) column was used for chlorpropham separation. The response of chlorpropham in the positive and negative ionization modes was investigated and optimized. The results showed that the response was better in the positive ion mode than that in the negative ion mode. After optimizing the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters, the sensitivity of the method was improved. Finally, the analytes were separated on the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) under a gradient elution program using acetonitrile and 0.2% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution as the mobile phases.

This investigation aimed to develop a Vitamin K database for commonly consumed foods that are commercially available in Australian supermarkets. The Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone; PK) and K2 (menaquinone; MK4, MK7) content of 60 foods known to contain Vitamin K were assessed (e.g., vegetables fruits, oils, animal products, dairy and fermented foods). A liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) method was developed and used to measure PK and MKs in different foods with an improved chromatographic separation and detection of Vitamin K's and their analogs. The LOD and LOQ for PK and MK4 was 0.1, 0.5 ng/ml and 0.5, 1.0 ng/ml, respectively. The majority foods contained detectable PK (53/60), about half contained MK4 (31/60), and few contained MK7 (3/60).

34945483,"Food allergies are caused by severe hypersensitivity to specific food allergens such as the egg protein ovalbumin. It is therefore important to test food products for the presence of allergens to protect allergic people from accidental ingestion. For egg detection, ELISA is the only reasonable commercially available test format, although the recognition of target allergens can be affected by food processing, which may lead to false negative results. Current mass spectrometry-based detection methods may overcome this issue, but these approaches are often less sensitive. Here we combined the advantages of antibody-based and MS-based methods by developing an immunoaffinity LC-MS/MS technique to detect the common egg allergen Gal d 2. We investigated the principal functionality of this method with incurred cookie material containing whole egg powder. We found that the new method matched easily the sensitivity of egg specific ELISA tests. Further western blot experiments indicated that this strategy may be unaffected by food processing, providing an important alternative strategy for the detection and quantification of allergens in food.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Improved Sensitivity of Allergen Detection by Immunoaffinity LC-MS/MS Using Ovalbumin as a Case Study.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34945483,2021

However, the overuse of PGRs may induce toxicity in food and even be hazardous to human health. Numerous studies have investigated the presence and residues of PGRs on vegetables and fruits. Animal-derived foods are one of the most dominant food sources providing nutrients to fulfil the daily dietary intake, and could also be potentially contaminated by PGRs.

It remains unclear, however, if CHD1 has a similar role in normal diploid cells. Using a specifically tailored quantitative mass spectrometry approach, we show that Chd1 disruption results in reduced H3.3 levels in heads of Chd1 mutant flies. Chd1 deletion perturbs brain chromatin structure in a similar way as H3.3 deletion and leads to global de-repression of transcription. The physiological consequences are reduced food intake, metabolic alterations, and shortened lifespan. Notably, brain-specific CHD1 expression rescues these phenotypes. We further demonstrate a strong genetic interaction between Chd1 and H3.3 chaperone Hira.

34341840,"Methods for the detection and quantification of food allergens in complex matrices are necessary to ensure compliance with labeling regulations and assess the effectiveness of food allergen preventive controls. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has emerged as an orthogonal technique in complement to immunochemical-based assays. However, the absence of established guidelines for MS-based quantification of allergens in food has limited harmonization among the method development community. In this study, different quantification strategies were evaluated using a previously developed multiplexed LC-MS/MS method for the detection of egg, milk, and peanut. Peptide performance criteria (retention time, signal-to-noise ratio, and ion ratio tolerance) were established and quantification approaches using varying calibrants, internal standards, background matrices, and calibration curve preparation schemes were systematically evaluated to refine the previous method for routine laboratory use. A matrix-matched calibration curve using allergen ingredients as calibrants and stable isotope-labeled peptides as internal standards provided the most accurate quantitative results. The strategy was further verified with commercially available reference materials and allowed for the confident detection and quantification of food allergens. This work highlights the need for transparency in calibration strategy and peptide performance requirements for effective evaluation of mass spectrometric methods for the quantification of food allergens.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000485', 'D000818', 'D010367', 'D002853', 'D004531', 'D005512', 'D007553', 'D008892', 'D053719']","['Allergens', 'Animals', 'Arachis', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Eggs', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Milk', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","Comparison of allergen quantification strategies for egg, milk, and peanut in food using targeted LC-MS/MS.","['Q000032', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000276', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000379']","['analysis', None, 'immunology', 'methods', None, 'immunology', None, 'immunology', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341840,2022
34266369,"The selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) clomiphene is therapeutically used to induce ovulation. While prohibited as a doping agent in sports, it is frequently detected in sports drug testing urine samples. Few reports exist on clomiphene's (illicit) use in the farming industry to increase the egg production rate of laying hens, which creates a risk that eggs as well as edible tissue of these hens contain residues of clomiphene. To investigate the potential transfer of clomiphene into eggs and muscle tissue, laying hens were orally administered with clomiphene citrate at 10 mg/day for 28 days. To determine clomiphene residues in eggs, chicken breast and chicken thigh, the target analyte was extracted from homogenised material with acetonitrile and subjected to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The test method reached a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 µg/kg and was characterised concerning specificity, precision, trueness and linearity. Analyses were performed on whole egg, egg white and yolk separately, and chicken muscle from breast and thigh. Clomiphene was detectable in eggs two days after the beginning of the drug administration period. The drug concentrations increased to 10-20 µg per egg within one week, and after withdrawal of clomiphene, residues decreased after 4 days, but traces of clomiphene were still detectable until the end of the study (14 days after the last administration). In the chicken's muscle tissue, clomiphene levels up to 150 µg/kg (thigh) and 36 µg/kg (breast) were found. Six days after the last dose, tissue clomiphene concentrations fell below the LOQ. Overall, these results underline the concerns that clomiphene may be transferred into animal-derived food and future research will therefore need to focus on assessing and minimising the risk of unintentional adverse analytical findings in doping controls.","Food additives & contaminants.

A method suitable for routine quantification of TMAO and its precursors (trimethylamine (TMA), choline, betaine, creatinine, and propionyl-, acetyl-, and L-carnitine) in clinical and food samples has been developed based on LC-MS. TMA was successfully derivatized using iodoacetonitrile, and no cross-reactions with TMAO or the other methylamines were detected. Extraction from clinical samples (plasma and urine) was performed after protein precipitation using acetonitrile:methanol. For food samples (meatballs and eggs), water extraction was shown to be sufficient, but acid hydrolysis was required to release bound choline before extraction. Baseline separation of the methylamines was achieved using a neutral HILIC column and a mobile phase consisting of 25 mmol/L ammonium formate in water:ACN (30:70). Quantification was performed by MS using external calibration and isotopic labelled internal standards. The assay proved suitable for both clinical and food samples and was linear from ≈ 0.1 up to 200 μmol/L for all methylamines except for TMA and TMAO, which were linear up to 100 μmol/L. Recoveries were 91-107% in clinical samples and 76-98% in food samples. The interday (n=8, four duplicate analysis) CVs were below 9% for all metabolites in clinical and food samples.

Overdoses of these drugs will lead to residual substances in animal-derived foods and accumulate in the body through the food chain, thereby exerting adverse effects on human health. Therefore, regulation of veterinary drug levels is imperative to ensure the quality of animal-derived foods and safeguard the health of consumers. In this study, a method based on ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with solid phase extraction (SPE-UPLC-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of eight prohibited and restricted veterinary drugs and three metabolite residues across four categories (chloramphenicols, nitroimidazoles, lincosamides, and macrolides) in eggs, liquid milk, chicken, and freshwater fish. The main factors affecting the response, recovery, and sensitivity of the method, such as the type and pH values of the extraction solvent, dilution solution for the analytes, type of chromatographic column, and type and proportion of the mobile phase, were optimized during sample pretreatment and instrument analysis. The samples were hydrolyzed and dispersed in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer solutions (pH 9.0) and extracted with acetonitrile. The extract was further extracted using ethyl acetate. After centrifugation, the supernatant ethyl acetate was concentrated to near dryness in nitrogen below 40 ℃. The residue was dissolved in 0.3 mL methanol, followed by the addition of 5.7 mL phosphate buffer solution. After shaking, the solutions were purified and enriched on an Oasis HLB SPE column.

33963436,"Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is one of the most powerful tools for the multiclass, multiresidue analysis of veterinary drugs, pesticides, mycotoxins, and other chemical contaminants in foods and other sample types. Until approximately 2010, commercial MS/MS instruments using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) were generally limited to minimum dwell (and inter-dwell) times of 10 ms per ion transition. To achieve the needed accuracy and detection limits for hundreds of targeted analytes, older UHPLC-MS/MS methods typically acquired only two ion transitions per analyte (yielding only one ion ratio for qualitative identification purposes), which is still the norm despite technological advancements. Newer instruments permit as little as 1 ms (inter-)dwell times to afford monitoring of more MRMs/analyte with minimal sacrifices in accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, quantification and identification were assessed in the validation of 169 veterinary drugs in liquid and powdered eggs. Quantitatively, an ""extract-and-inject"" sample preparation method yielded acceptable 70-120% recoveries and < 25% RSD for 139-141 (82-83%) of the 169 diverse drug analytes spiked into powdered and liquid eggs, respectively, at three levels of regulatory interest. Qualitatively, rates of false positives and negatives were compared when applying three different regulatory identification criteria in which two or three MRMs/drug were used in each case. Independent of the identification criteria, rates of false positives remained <10% for 95-99% of the drugs whether 2 or 3 ions were monitored, but the percent of drugs with >10% false negatives decreased from 25-45 to 10-12% when using 2 vs. 3 MRMs/analyte, respectively. Use of a concentration threshold at 10% of the regulatory level as an identification criterion was also very useful to reduce rates of false positives independent of ion ratios. Based on these results, monitoring >2 ion transitions per analyte is advised when using MS/MS for analysis, independent of SANTE/12682/2019, FDA/USDA, or 2002/657/EC identification criteria.

To address this gap, 3,100 samples from seven food categories, including beef, pork, mutton, offals, broilers, hen eggs, and farmed freshwater fish, marketed throughout four geographical regions of GD, were collected from 2015 to 2018. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was employed to detect PCP levels in these food matrices. PCP was found in all food categories, but the average contamination levels were low, ranging from 0.40 µg/kg wet weight (ww) (hen eggs) to 5.85 µg/kg ww (offals). However, higher concentrations of PCP were detected (P < 0.05) in animal source food from the North region. Additionally, a temporal declining trend was observed in this four-year consecutive survey. The estimated human dietary exposure of PCP to population groups, including the general population and subgroups (male and female, children, and adults), was found to be far below the permissible daily intake (3 µg/kg body weight). Therefore, the health impacts of PCP should be correspondingly low for local residents, based on current toxicological knowledge.

This study aimed to clarify how habitual food intake influences the circulating plasma metabolome in a free-living Japanese regional population and to identify potential food intake biomarkers. To achieve this aim, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis as part of a large cohort study. From a baseline survey of the Tsuruoka Metabolome Cohort Study, 7,012 eligible male and female participants aged 40-69 years were chosen for this study. All data on patients' health status and dietary intake were assessed via a food frequency questionnaire, and plasma samples were obtained during an annual physical examination. Ninety-four charged plasma metabolites were measured using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry, by a non-targeted approach. Statistical analysis was performed using partial-least-square regression. A total of 21 plasma metabolites were likely to be associated with long-term food intake of nine food groups.

The EU determines that the daily acceptable intake of canthaxanthin (ADI) is 0.03 mg canthaxanthin per kg body weight. In order to protect people's diet health and avoid the occurrence of food safety accidents, this paper measured the content of canthaxanthin in 114 egg samples sourced from different regions of China using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The dietary exposure assessment method was used to evaluate the dietary risk to Chinese consumers. Results showed that the content of canthaxanthin varies significantly across regions of origin, with eggs produced in Beijing having a lower amount than those from other regions. The average dietary exposure of children (2-10 years old) was 0.242 ~ 0.653 μg/(kg bw∙d), and the dietary exposure of 95/97.5/99 percentile was 0.246 ~ 1.779 μg/(kg bw∙d). The maximum exposure was 3.089 μg/(kg bw∙d), and its risk quotient was 0.103 (<1), which was an acceptable risk. For the teenager group (11-18 years old), the average dietary exposure was 0.141 ~ 0.247 μg/(kg bw∙d), and the dietary exposure at the 95/97.5/99 percentile was 0.143 ~ 0.671 μg/(kg bw∙d), presenting an acceptable risk.

Eighteen PAHs were determined by gas chromatography in maternal liver and uterine content (uterine eggs and early-stage development embryos) samples to determine the maternal transfer rate. The mean rate of PAHs offloaded to the offspring was of 13%, with high variability among individual congener transfer (0.7-29.9%) and benzo[b]fluoranthene attaining the highest maternal transfer rates. Differential transfer rates were attributed to physicochemical proprieties of each compound, with low molecular level PAHs presenting the highest rates.

33207646,"Citrinin (CIT) is a polyketide mycotoxin occurring in a variety of food and feedstuff, among which cereal grains are the most important contaminated source. Pigs and poultry are important livestock animals frequently exposed to mycotoxins, including CIT. Concerns are rising related to the toxic, and especially the potential nephrotoxic, properties of CIT. The purpose of this study was to clarify the histopathological effects on kidneys, liver, jejunum and duodenum of pigs, broiler chickens and laying hens receiving CIT contaminated feed. During 3 weeks, pigs (n = 16) were exposed to feed containing 1 mg CIT/kg feed or to control feed (n = 4), while 2 groups of broiler chickens and laying hens (n = 8 per group) received 0.1 mg CIT/kg feed (lower dose group) and 3 or 3.5 mg CIT/kg feed (higher dose group), respectively, or control feed (n = 4). CIT concentrations were quantified in plasma, kidneys, liver, muscle and eggs using a validated ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method. Kidneys, liver, duodenum and jejunum were evaluated histologically using light microscopy, while the kidneys were further examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Histopathology did not reveal major abnormalities at the given contamination levels. However, a significant increase of swollen and degenerated mitochondria in renal cortical cells from all test groups were observed (p < 0.05). These observations could be related to oxidative stress, which is the major mechanism of CIT toxicity. Residues of CIT were detected in all collected tissues, except for muscle and egg white from layers in the lowest dose group, and egg white from layers in the highest dose group. CIT concentrations in plasma ranged between 0.1 (laying hens in lower dose group) and 20.8 ng/mL (pigs). In tissues, CIT concentrations ranged from 0.6 (muscle) to 20.3 µg/kg (liver) in pigs, while concentrations in chickens ranged from 0.1 (muscle) to 70.2 µg/kg (liver).

The Gal d 1-4 recovery in fresh and processed eggs was 68.3-121.3%, and intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 1.5-15.7% and 2.4-38.1%, respectively, indicating high sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility.

33011574,"A program to reintroduce the Northern Aplomado falcon (Falco femoralis septentrionalis) in south Texas and the southwestern United States was initiated in the late 1970s. Fledgling Aplomado falcons were first released in the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge in 1993 and the first nesting pair in the area was recorded by 1995. During 2004-2017 we collected addled eggs from nesting pairs in the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge and Matagorda Island in south Texas, to determine if environmental contaminants in Aplomado falcon eggs had decreased over time and if eggshell thickness values were similar to those in the pre-DDT era. We analyzed organochlorine pesticides, PCBs, and PBDEs in 60 egg homogenates by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Eggshells were measured to determine thickness and to correlate with contaminant concentrations. Mean concentration in eggs were 244 ng/g ww for p,p'- DDE, 270 ng/g ww for PCBs and 10 ng/g ww for PBDEs. These values were lower than those reported in a previous study for eggs collected between 1999 and 2003, with a mean of 821 ng/g ww for p,p'-DDE and 1228 ng/g ww for total PCBs. Eggshell thickness ranged from 0.206 mm to 0.320 mm (n = 156). Overall, contaminant concentrations in eggs of Aplomado falcons were low, at levels not likely to impact the recovery of the species. Data from this and previous studies indicate that DDE has decreased significantly in eggs of Aplomado falcons over the last 25 years in south Texas. Breeding populations have been steady at over 30 breeding pairs in south Texas since 2011, although they decreased to 24 pairs in 2018 following Hurricane Harvey.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D000818', 'D004531', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D046093', 'D006843', 'D000083462', 'D011078', 'D013781']","['Animals', 'Eggs', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Falconiformes', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated', 'Persistent Organic Pollutants', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Texas']",Persistent organic pollutants in eggs from south Texas Aplomado falcons.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33011574,2020
32971306,"Quantifying spawning biomass of commercially relevant fish species is important to generate fishing quotas. This will mostly rely on the annual or daily production of fish eggs. However, these have to be identified precisely to species level to obtain a reliable estimate of offspring production of the different species. Because morphological identification can be very difficult, recent developments are heading towards application of molecular tools. Methods such as COI barcoding have long handling times and cause high costs for single specimen identifications. In order to test MALDI-TOF MS, a rapid and cost-effective alternative for species identification, we identified fish eggs using COI barcoding and used the same specimens to set up a MALDI-TOF MS reference library. This library, constructed from two different MALDI-TOF MS instruments, was then used to identify unknown eggs from a different sampling occasion. By using a line of evidence from hierarchical clustering and different supervised identification approaches we obtained concordant species identifications for 97.5% of the unknown fish eggs, proving MALDI-TOF MS a good tool for rapid species level identification of fish eggs. At the same time we point out the necessity of adjusting identification scores of supervised methods for identification to optimize identification success. SIGNIFICANCE: Fish products are commercially highly important and many societies rely on them as a major food resource. Over many decades stocks of various relevant fish species have been reduced due to unregulated overfishing. Nowadays, to avoid overfishing and threatening of important fish species, fish stocks are regularly monitored. One component of this monitoring is the monitoring of spawning stock sizes. Whereas this is highly dependent on correct species identification of fish eggs, morphological identification is difficult because of lack of morphological features.",Journal of proteomics,"['D000818', 'D003247', 'D005398', 'D020543', 'D013048', 'D019032']","['Animals', 'Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Fisheries', 'Proteome', 'Specimen Handling', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Rapid species level identification of fish eggs by proteome fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF MS.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32971306,2021
32961206,"Morbidity associated with hepatic and urogenital schistosomiasis stems primarily from the host immune response directed against schistosome eggs. When eggs become entrapped in host tissues, the development of fibrotic plaques drives downstream pathology. These events occur due to the antigenic nature of egg excretory/secretory products (ESPs). Both Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum ESPs have been shown to interact with several cell populations in the host liver including hepatocytes, macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells, with both immunomodulatory and pathological consequences. Several protein components of the ESPs of S. mansoni and S. japonicum eggs have been characterised; however, studies into the collective contents of schistosome egg ESPs are lacking. Utilising shotgun mass spectrometry and an array of in silico analyses, we identified 266, 90 and 50 proteins within the S. mansoni, S. japonicum and S. haematobium egg secretomes respectively. We identified numerous proteins with already established immunomodulatory activities, vaccine candidates and vesicle markers. Relatively few common orthologues within the ESPs were identified by BLAST, indicating that the three egg secretomes differ in content significantly. Having a clearer understanding of these components may lead to the identification of new proteins with uncharacterised immunomodulatory potential or pathological relevance.

The VITAL® initiative for voluntary incidental trace allergen labeling suggests protein reference doses, based on clinical reactivity in food challenge studies, at or below which voluntary labelling is unnecessary. Here, we investigated if current analytical methodology could verify the published VITAL® 2.0 doses, that were available during this analysis, in serving sizes between 5 and 500 g. Available data on published and commercial ELISA, PCR and mass spectrometry methods, especially for the detection of peanuts, soy, hazelnut, wheat, cow's milk and hen's egg were reviewed in detail. Limit of detection, quantitative capability, matrix compatibility, and specificity were assessed. Implications by the recently published VITAL® 3.0 doses were also considered. We conclude that available analytical methods are capable of reasonably robust detection of peanut, soy, hazelnut and wheat allergens for levels at or below the VITAL® 2.0 and also 3.0 doses, with some methods even capable of achieving this in a large 500 g serving size.

32854310,"Food allergies are a global food challenge. For correct food labelling, the detection and quantification of allergens are necessary. However, novel product formulations and industrial processes produce new scenarios, which require much more technological developments. For this purpose, OMICS technologies, especially proteomics, seemed to be relevant in this context. This review summarises the current knowledge and studies that used proteomics to study food allergens. In the case of the allergenic proteins, a wide variety of isoforms, post-translational modifications and other structural changes during food processing can increase or decrease the allergenicity. Most of the plant-based food allergens are proteins with biological functions involved in storage, structure, and plant defence. The allergenicity of these proteins could be increased by the presence of heavy metals, air pollution, and pesticides. Targeted proteomics like selected/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) have been very useful, especially in the case of gluten from wheat, rye and barley, and allergens from lentil, soy, and fruit. Conventional 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting have been further widely used. For animal-based food allergens, the widely used technologies are 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF, and more recently LC-MS/MS, which is becoming useful to assess egg, fish, or milk allergens. The detection and quantification of allergenic proteins using mass spectrometry-based proteomics are promising and would contribute to greater accuracy, therefore improving consumer information.",Biology,[],[],Current Trends in Proteomic Advances for Food Allergen Analysis.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854310,2020

32652410,"Mass spectrometry-based methods coupled with stable isotope dilution have become effective and widely used methods for the detection and quantification of food allergens. Current methods target signature peptides resulting from proteolytic digestion of proteins of the allergenic ingredient. The choice of appropriate stable isotope-labelled internal standard is crucial, given the diversity of encountered food matrices which can affect sample preparation and analysis. We propose the use of concatemer, an artificial and stable isotope-labelled protein composed of several concatenated signature peptides as internal standard. With a comparative analysis of three matrices contaminated with four allergens (egg, milk, peanut, and hazelnut), the concatemer approach was found to offer advantages associated with the use of labelled proteins, ideal but unaffordable, and circumvent certain limitations of traditionally used synthetic peptides as internal standards.

32593171,"Large-scale insect rearing for food and feed production can be improved by understanding diet digestion and host-microbe interactions. To examine these processes in black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.; Diptera: Stratiomyidae) larvae, two protocols were developed. Protocol 1 describes a method to produce viable, sterile black soldier fly larvae and a gentle method for diet sterilization. Sterile black soldier fly larvae can be used to study the diverse role of microbes in larval development. Nutrient requirements of sterile black soldier fly larvae are met only through diet. Viable sterile black soldier fly larvae were consistently generated using a four-step treatment with alternating immersions of eggs for 2 min each in ethanol (70%) and sodium hypochlorite (0.6%), over two cycles. A nonthermal method of diet sterilization, namely high-energy electron beam (HEEB) treatment, was introduced. Subsequently, growth of sterile black soldier fly larvae was observed on the HEEB-treated diets (40, 60, and 40% of replicates with poultry feed, liver pie, and an artificial diet, respectively) but not on autoclaved diets. In Protocol 2, we propose a novel method to collect frass from individual larvae. We then measured the metabolites in frass, using high-pressure liquid chromatography. Results on metabolites confirmed the influence of digestion. For instance, succinate increased from 1 to 2 and 7 μmol/g sample from diet to gut homogenate and frass, respectively. The collection method is a promising tool to estimate the diet and nutrient requirements of black soldier fly larvae, thus increasing the performance and reliability of black soldier fly larvae rearing.

Though the fibrinolytic activity could vary in different kinds of Jotgal, this activity seems to be produced by microorganisms during the natural fermentation stage. From Gonjaengijot (pickled opossum shrimp), two novel fibrinolytic enzymes named by JP-I and JP-II, have been purified by ethanol precipitation, Bio-GEL P-100 gel filtration, and DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography. Compared to the crude enzyme extract, the specific activity of the JP-I and JP-II increased 258, 85-fold with the recovery of 22.1, 8.5%, respectively. The molecular weights of both enzymes were estimated as 36 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The optimal condition for fibrinolytic activity of JP-I was at 50°C and pH 8.1, while that of JP-II was at 45°C and 9.9. Both enzymes were stable at a broad range of pH (5.0 to 10.5) and have metalloprotease nature. From these results, it concludes that these enzymes could be a novel potent thrombolytic agent. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The fibrinolytic enzyme is one of the clinical agents for cardiovascular diseases which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with 17 million deaths every year. A variety of fibrinolytic enzymes are found and characterized from various sources such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, and new sources for fibrinolytic enzymes continue to be explored. Jotgal, widely used in Korean people's diet, is a traditional Korean seafood prepared from many different types of fishes, fish eggs, fish intestines, and shellfishes.

After the multistep optimization, the developed double ICA allowed for antibiotics detection with instrumental limits of detection/cutoff levels of 0.09/2 ng/mL and 0.008/0.8 ng/mL for TYL and LIN, respectively, within 10 min. The cross-reactivity was 40% to lincosamide clindamycin and negligible to other antibiotics tested. The test system allowed for the detection of TYL and LIN in milk, honey, and eggs.

32134068,"The most significant cost driver for efficient bio-production of edible animal proteins is the cell culture media, where growth factors account for up to 96% of the total cost. The culture media must be serum-free, affordable, contain only food-grade ingredients, be efficient to promote cell growth and available in massive quantities. The commercially available serum substitutes are expensive and not necessarily food-grade. Identifying inexpensive food-safe alternatives to serum is crucial. By-products from food production are available in massive quantities, contain potential factors that can promote growth and are promising ingredients for serum replacement. The main goal of this study was to explore if food-grade by-product materials can be used as growth promoting agents in skeletal muscle cell culture to develop a tailor-made serum free media. Different by-products, including chicken carcass, cod backbone, eggshell membrane, egg white powder and pork plasma were enzymatically or chemically hydrolyzed. The hydrolysates in addition to lyophilized pork plasma and yeast extract were further characterized by size-exclusion chromatography, elemental combustion analysis and degree of hydrolysis. The materials were used as supplement to or replacement of commercial serum and further evaluated for their effect on metabolic activity, cell proliferation and cell cytotoxicity in muscle cells cultured in vitro. Our results indicate that none of the materials were cytotoxic to the skeletal muscle cells. Hydrolysates rich in peptides with approximately 2-15 amino acids in length were shown to improve cell growth and metabolic activity. Of all the materials tested pork plasma hydrolysates and yeast extract were the most promising. Pork plasma hydrolysates increased metabolic activity by 110% and cell proliferation with 48% when cultured in serum-free conditions for 3 days compared with control cells cultured with full serum conditions. Most interestingly, this response was dependent on both material and choice of enzyme used.

Two formats of immunochromatographic analysis (ICA) based on different approaches of introducing gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as a label were compared. It was demonstrated that an indirect ICA method where GNPs were conjugated with anti-species antibodies allowed the achievement of both instrumental and visual detection limits of LIN almost two orders of magnitude lower than those achieved in the standard direct ICA format. In the optimized conditions, the developed indirect ICA allowed for the detection of LIN within 15 min, with instrumental and visual detection limits of 8 pg/mL and 0.8 ng/mL. The assay showed 40% cross-reactivity to clindamycin (CLIN) as a structural analogue of LIN, with no interaction with antibiotics from other classes. The developed ICA was applied for LIN detection in a panel of food products. No treatment of cow milk was necessary before the analysis. For chicken eggs and honey, a simple procedure of preliminary sample preparation was developed, which fully prevented a matrix influence on the assay results. It was demonstrated that ICA could detect LIN in food products while preserving the same analytical characteristics as in the buffer.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate exposure of ornamental and backyard chickens to OTA using biliary ochratoxin A as a biomarker. Therefore, bile samples, in addition to kidney, liver and muscle, were collected from 102 chickens reared in 16 farms located in 6 Italian regions. High-performance liquid chromatography method and fluorimetric detection (HPLC-FLD) analysis were carried out firstly on bile from all animals, and OTA was detected in 12 chickens (concentration range 3.83-170.42 µg/L). Subsequently, the kidneys of these chickens were also analysed, and the mycotoxin was not detected. The analytical detection limits (LODs) of OTA in bile and kidney were 2.1 µg/L and 0.1 µg/kg, respectively. In conclusion, these animals were exposed to OTA but their meat can be considered safe, given that this mycotoxin, if present, concentrates highest in kidneys.

In this work, we described the results of a comprehensive evaluation of the current literature on MS-based allergen detection aiming at collecting all available information about proteins and peptide markers validated in independent studies for the six allergenic ingredients of interest. The main features of the targeted proteins were commented reviewing all details available about known isoforms and sequence homology particularly in plant-derived allergens.

31953705,"Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata L. Walp. (Fabaceae), is one of the most important food legumes grown on the African continent, as it provides an affordable source of dietary protein. Yields of cowpea are significantly reduced through damage by legume pod-borer, Maruca vitrata (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), caterpillars to flowers, tender leaves and pods. Semiochemical-based strategies are considered as environmentally benign and affordable for pest management, particularly on smallholder farms. In this study, we investigated the importance of cowpea flower volatiles as host location cues for egg-laying M. vitrata, and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) as M. vitrata repellents and natural enemy (Apanteles taragamae and Phanerotoma syleptae parasitoid) attractants. In oviposition choice assays, M. vitrata laid more eggs on flowering cowpea plants than non-flowering plants. Coupled gas chromatography-electrophysiology (GC-EAG) analysis using the antennae of female M. vitrata and an extract of flower volatiles collected by dynamic headspace collection revealed the presence of five EAG-active components that were identified by coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis as benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, acetophenone, a vinylbenzaldehyde isomer and (E)-cinnamaldehyde. A synthetic blend of the identified compounds, prepared using 3-vinylbenzaldehyde, induced M. vitrata to lay as many eggs on non-flowering cowpea as on flowering plants. The moths also preferred laying eggs on intact plants compared to M. vitrata-infested plants. As the emission of EAG-active floral compounds was determined to be lower in the headspace of infested cowpea flowers, the role of HIPVs emitted by M. vitrata-damaged leaves was also investigated. Of the compounds induced by larval damage, (E)-DMNT, indole, n-hexyl acetate, 1-octen-3-ol and linalool were shown by GC-EAG to possess electrophysiological activity. A synthetic blend of the EAG-active compounds, using racemic 1-octen-3-ol and linalool, significantly reduced egg numbers on flowering cowpea. Larval and egg parasitoids, i.e. A. taragamae and Ph. syleptae, respectively, of M. vitrata both preferred the Y-tube olfactometer arm treated with synthetic (E)-DMNT, whereas preference for racemic linalool and (E)-nerolidol was dose-dependent in A. taragamae.

31931892,"Brominated flame retardants (BFR) are primarily used as flame retardant additives in insulating materials. These lipophilic compounds can bioaccumulate in animal tissues, leading to human exposure via food ingestion. Although their concentration in food is not yet regulated, several of these products are recognised as persistent organic pollutants; they are thought to act as endocrine disruptors. The present study aimed to characterise the occurrence of two families of BFRs (hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)) in hen eggs and broiler or pig meat in relation to their rearing environments. Epidemiological studies were carried out on 60 hen egg farms (34 without an open-air range, 26 free-range), 57 broiler farms (27 without an open-air range, 30 free-range) and 42 pig farms without an open-air range in France from 2013 to 2015. For each farm, composite samples from either 12 eggs, five broiler pectoral muscles or three pig tenderloins were obtained. Eight PBDE congeners and three HBCDD stereoisomers were quantified in product fat using gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, or high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The frequencies of PBDE detection were 28% for eggs (median concentration 0.278 ng/g fat), 72% for broiler muscle (0.392 ng/g fat) and 49% for pig muscle (0.403 ng/g fat). At least one HBCDD stereoisomer was detected in 17% of eggs (0.526 ng/g fat), 46% of broiler muscle (0.799 ng/g fat) and 36% of pig muscle (0.616 ng/g fat). Results were similar in concentration to those obtained in French surveillance surveys from 2012 to 2016. Nevertheless, the contamination of free-range eggs and broilers was found to be more frequent than that of conventional ones, suggesting that access to an open-air range could be an additional source of exposure to BFRs for animals. However, the concentration of BFRs in all products remained generally very low. No direct relationship could be established between the occurrence of BFRs in eggs and meat and the characteristics of farm buildings (age, building materials). The potential presence of BFRs in insulating materials is not likely to constitute a significant source of animal exposure as long as the animals do not have direct access to these materials.",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,"['D000383', 'D000818', 'D002645', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D000072480', 'D005411', 'D005602', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D008460', 'D013552']","['Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Farms', 'Flame Retardants', 'France', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Meat', 'Swine']",Do farming conditions influence brominated flame retardant levels in pig and poultry products?,"[None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931892,2020

The source materials were collected from laying hens following oral administration of ciprofloxacin. An optimized homogenization method and a strict bottling process were applied to bulk whole egg materials to prepare the CRM candidate. The mass fraction of ciprofloxacin in whole liquid egg was certified by a collaborative characterization program with eight accredited participating laboratories. Liquid chromatography coupled with isotope dilution mass spectrometry was studied as a reliable reference method for value assignment and was used by all participating laboratories.

31891708,"Paragonimiasis, an important food-borne zoonosis, is caused by lung flukes of the genus Paragonimus. Several million people are actually infected or at risk. Paragonimiasis is a re-emerging disease in developing countries. Diagnosis of pulmonary paragonimiasis is made by finding eggs in sputa and/or fecal samples. Eggs are typically not found in ectopic paragonimiasis cases, so diagnosis depends on supportive information, such as a history of eating fresh water crabs or crayfishes, radiographic findings and immunological tests. Here, a new point-of-care-testing (POCT) tool is presented. It uses immunochromatography for serodiagnosis of human paragonimiasis using excretory-secretory antigen from Paragonimus heterotremus. It proved effective in diagnosing infections due to P. heterotremus, and was also successfully diagnosed with sera from infections with P. westermani and P. miyazakii.

The highest median concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene and the sum of all the 16 PAHs (29 and 760 μg/kg, respectively) were found in the disposable powder packets, followed by dried bonito flakes (24 and 512 μg/kg, respectively), and instant bouillons (11 and 227 μg/kg, respectively). These concentrations were much higher than those in the other products tested. We also investigated the percentages of the PAHs transferred from dried bonito flakes and a disposable powder packet to soup stocks commonly prepared at home. These were extremely low (<4%), even though they contained relatively high concentrations of the PAHs. Finally, the intake of benzo[a]pyrene and the sum of the intakes of four PAHs, as a marker proposed by the European Food Safety Authority, were estimated based on the data from a Japanese food consumption survey and the mean concentrations found in smoked fish and smoked fish products. These estimates suggest intakes of PAHs pose a low concern for consumer health.",Journal of food protection,"['D000818', 'D005396', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D007564', 'D008460', 'D011084']","['Animals', 'Fish Products', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Meat', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons']",Concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Smoked Foods in Japan.,"[None, None, 'Q000191', None, None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'economics', None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31855450,2020

Recent studies revealed a number of novel egg-derived proteins/peptides (EDPs), and EDPs may play a crucial role in food industry and medical therapy. First, these EDPs were purified from the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysates of egg proteins and were characterized by biochemical assays such as gel electrophoresis, HPLC, mass spectrometry, proteomic and peptideomic analysis, etc. Second, some EDPs can be used as nontoxic bio-preservatives and functional nutraceuticals for replacing harmful sodium nitrite, inhibiting foodborne pathogens, promoting metal-ion absorption and improving meat-product quality, and these new features will be widely used in the field of food production. Third, novel medical properties of EDPs comprise anti-oxidative, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activities, which will benefit prevention of cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetic mellitus, immune disorders, etc. In summary, this review gives a real insight into the novel nutritional, biological and medical functions of EDPs, predictably facilitating the applications of EDPs in production of nutritive supplements, functional nutraceuticals and therapeutic medicines.",Research in veterinary science,"['D000818', 'D001688', 'D002645', 'D004527', 'D004531', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D010455', 'D057285', 'D040901', 'D014815']","['Animals', 'Biological Products', 'Chickens', 'Egg Proteins', 'Eggs', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Peptides', 'Precision Medicine', 'Proteomics', 'Vitamins']","Promising hen egg-derived proteins/peptides (EDPs) for food engineering, natural products and precision medicines.","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31809972,2020
31807654,"Recent years have seen increased interest in the influence of bioactive dietary components on human genes and gene expression. A good source of many bioactive substances is the chicken egg. The egg is considered to be an excellent food provided by nature. It is a good source of nutrients such as vitamins A, B2, B6, B12, D, E and K, as well as elements including phosphorus, selenium, iron, zinc, magnesium and calcium. The research material use in this study consisted of eggs from hens kept in two different systems: organic and battery cages. The content of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) was determined in the egg contents - in the yolk and white respectively. The content of elements was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) using an AA280 FS spectrometer with the automatic dilution of standards and samples. The eggs from the organically raised hens had a higher calcium, magnesium and zinc content. The greater variation in the Ca, Mg and Zn content in the organic eggs is due to the more individualized feeding system. The rearing system of the hens significantly affects the concentration of elements in the egg. The results of this research indicate that eggs from organic farming systems have a richer chemical composition in terms of the content of nutrients such as calcium, magnesium and zinc compared with eggs obtained from caged hens. Therefore, consumers purchasing eggs should consider the system in which the hens were reared, as eggs can be a valuable source of these elements in the diet.",Archives animal breeding,[],[],Content of selected inorganic compounds in the eggs of hens kept in two different systems: organic and battery cage.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31807654,2020

In this work, we report the first approach to the study of fipronil and two metabolites, fipronil-sulfone and fipronil-sulfide by CE. MEKC mode was employed using a solution of 50 mM ammonium perfluorooctanoate pH 9.0 with 10% (v/v) methanol as background electrolyte. The proposed method was combined with a simple sample treatment based on salting-out assisted LLE (SALLE) using acetonitrile as extraction solvent and ammonium sulfate as salt. The SALLE-MEKC-UV method allowed the simultaneous quantification of fipronil and fipronil-sulfone. Validation parameters yielded satisfactory results, with precision, expressed as relative SD, below 14% and recoveries higher than 83%.

31750947,"The abuse of pesticides in home gardens may lead to contamination of home-grown eggs. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), aldrin, and malathion pesticides residues in egg white and egg yolk of home-grown eggs in Jordan; and the effect of refrigerated storage and heat treatment (boiling and frying) on residues level. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to detect pesticide residues in egg samples (n = 200) obtained from households that raise laying hens in Jordan. About 96% of the tested eggs showed pesticide residues. None of the tested egg samples showed residual level above maximum residue limit (MRL 0.02 mg/kg) for HCH, whereas 33% and 44% of samples were above MRL for aldrin and malathion, respectively. All studied pesticide residues were detected from both egg yolk and egg white. The concentrations of malathion and aldrin (0.075 and 0.067 mg/kg) in egg yolk were higher than those (0.049 and 0.058 mg/kg) in egg white samples. Pesticide residue levels were quite stable during refrigeration storage whereas heat treatment (boiling at 100 °C and frying at 160 °C) significantly reduced contamination levels to values below MRL. The high level of pesticide residues in home-grown egg in Jordan may reflect the improper use of pesticides in home gardens and thus exposing the environment to unwanted pollution and the risk they may pose on human health. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Home-grown eggs could be exposed to pesticides more than commercial eggs as free-range hens interact directly with the environment and ingest soil or materials on/in the soil that might be contaminated with pesticides used in home gardens or farms.

Totally, 28 specific peptides were verified as unique to EBN and its adulterants by tandem mass spectrometry. Subsequently, 9 quantitative MRM-transitions of peptides from adulterants and 2 internal standard references from EBN were screened for the quantitative analysis of the adulterants, which allowed detection of adulterants in EBN matrix in the range of 1-80%.

An assessment of the dietary risk for Chinese consumers revealed that the hazard quotients (HQ) values for tilmicosin consumption were less than 1 for dose 1 and greater than 1 for dose 2, with children (2 to 7 years) and adult males (over 65 years) being the high-risk groups. These results suggest that the possible risk associated with tilmicosin contamination in eggs should not be ignored since the accidental or occasional misuse of tilmicosin in the case of egg-laying hens may occur from time to time, particularly on small farms. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The modified QuEChERS method was used to analyze the tilmicosin residues in egg matrices and a subsequent dietary exposure assessment for Chinese consumers was performed, which can serve as a reference for the food safety risk posed by antibiotic misuse in egg layers.",Journal of food science,"['D000293', 'D000328', 'D000368', 'D000818', 'D000900', 'D002645', 'D002648', 'D002675', 'D002681', 'D003257', 'D004350', 'D004531', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D059022', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D008875', 'D015645', 'D055815']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Chickens', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Drug Residues', 'Eggs', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Safety', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tylosin', 'Young Adult']",Evaluation of Tilmicosin Contamination in Eggs Following Its Administration to Laying Hens and Subsequent Assessment of Dietary Risks to Chinese Consumers.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000031', None]","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524951,2020

We focused our research to determine the amount of free cysteine consumed highly in foods such as pork, beef, poultry, eggs, dairy, red peppers, soybeans, broccoli, brussels sprouts, oats, and wheat germs. A newly designed carbazole-pyridine-based fluorescent probe (CPI) has been introduced for quantitative estimation of cysteine (Cys) with a ""turn on"" fluorescence in some popular processed food samples chosen from our daily diet. CPI shows both naked eye and UV-visible color changes upon interaction with cysteine. The binding approach between CPI and Cys at biological pH has been thoroughly explored by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. From Job's plot analysis, 1:1 stoichiometric reaction between CPI and Cys is observed with a detection limit of 3.8 μM. NMR, ESI mass spectrometry, and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) study enlightens the formation of more stable product CPI-Cys. The ""turn on"" response of the probe CPI occurs due to the interruption of intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) process upon reacting with cysteine. Moreover, CPI is a very stable, cost-effective compound and exhibits excellent real-time selectivity towards Cys over all other comparative biorelevant analytes.

In some cases, the mechanisms that are involved in these reactions are not thoroughly understood and can lead to unexpected problems and delayed haze formation after CMC addition to red wines. Small-scale bench trials were conducted in model systems under different pH conditions to monitor the formation of turbidity and protection mechanisms during the interaction of proteins, polyphenols, and polysaccharides.

31139860,"The unintentional presence of even trace amounts of certain foods constitutes a major hazard for those who suffer from food allergies. For many food industries, product and raw ingredient surveillance forms part of their risk assessment procedures. This may require the detection of multiple allergens in a wide variety of matrices. Mass spectrometry offers a possible solution for the quantification of multiple allergens in a single analysis. The capability of MS to quantify many peptides from a complex protein digestion is well known. However, a lack of matrix certified reference materials has made the optimisation of extraction and digestion conditions for multiplexed allergen quantification difficult to assess. Here, we report a systematic study, using preliminary screening followed by a Design of Experiments approach, to find the optimal buffer and digestion conditions for detecting milk and egg protein markers in a model processed food matrix. Five of the most commonly used buffers, two chaotropic reagents and two reducing reagents were assessed for the optimal extraction of multiple protein markers. While the choice of background buffer had little impact, the use of chaotropic and reducing reagents showed significant benefits for the extraction of most proteins. A full factorial design experiment was applied to the parameters shown to have a significant impact on protein recovery. These studies suggest that a single optimal set of extraction conditions enabling the quantitative recovery of all proteins is not easily achieved. Therefore, although MS is capable of the simultaneous quantification of many peptides in a single run, greater consideration of protein extraction is required before these are applied for multiplex allergen quantification in food matrices.

Intralaboratory validation of the developed method was performed in terms of recovery, repeatability, linear calibration ranges, instrumental and method limits of quantitation (i-LOQ and m-LOQ). Where possible, trueness was verified by the analysis of reference materials (RMs). For analytes with available isotopically labeled surrogates, recoveries in the range of 70-120% and repeatability rates below 20% were observed, while for compounds quantitated using absolute calibration the values of recovery ranged from 59 to 153% and the repeatability in terms of RSDs was in the range of 1-26%. The values measured for the four analyzed RMs agreed with the provided consensus values, revealing that the recovery of reference concentrations for compounds with assigned consensus values was in 72-119% range.

31065708,"Yellow and orange egg yolks are good sources of xanthophyll carotenoids, consumption of which is associated with health benefits, such as cancer prevention, eye health, and bone health. Industrial feed fortificants used to improve egg yolk color and carotenoid concentration typically are derived from marigold flowers. Green leafy vegetables are also concentrated sources of the xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin (L+Z), but they have not been rigorously evaluated in laying hen feeds as a yolk colorant. The addition of food manufacturing byproducts, including carrot leaves, to animal feed is a promoted method of improving animal nutrition. The ability of dehydrated carrot leaves to improve egg yolk color and L+Z concentration was evaluated by feeding laying hens (n = 40) white maize-based feeds fortified with 2 different dehydrated carrot leaves, marigold as a positive control, or no fortificant as a negative control for 28 D. After a 7-D washout period, the hens were separated into 4 groups, and eggs were collected every other day. Yolks were analyzed by using a portable colorimeter to define the color space and by ultra-performance liquid chromatography to determine the carotenoid profile. Carotenoid concentration rapidly declined from day 0 to 8, confirming adequate washout conditions. The white maize negative control (WM) day 28 lutein concentration (3.59 ± 0.51 nmol/g) was significantly less than orange-carrot leaf-treated (OCL) (5.34 ± 0.36 nmol/g) and red-carrot leaf-treated hens (RCL) (5.92 ± 1.00 nmol/g) in addition to the marigold-treated hens (MG). However, MG was significantly higher than both leaf-treated groups. From day 8 (3.93 ± 0.74 nmol/g) to 28 (9.32 ± 1.66 nmol/g), MG had the largest increase in lutein and was the only treatment to surpass day 0 initial concentrations (8.50 ± 1.64 nmol/g).

Unlike the widely employed SPE approaches, based on cation-exchange, PBA SPE relies on the reversible formation of covalent bonds with the analytes. The advantage of using PBA lies in the fact that this compound strongly and stably retains analytes, and the pH of the loading solution can be easily adjusted using a high-concentration buffer. The clean-up conditions, such as the pH of the loading solution and the acetonitrile concentration in the elution and wash solvents, were optimized.

31018418,"This study was conceived as a first step to evaluate the suitability of adipose tissue cadmium (Cd) concentrations as a biomarker for the assessment of long-term exposure. Specifically, the aim of this work was to explore the socio-demographic, dietary, and lifestyle determinants of adipose tissue Cd concentrations. The study population is a subsample of GraMo cohort. Adipose tissue samples were intraoperatively collected from 226 adult volunteers recruited in two public hospitals from Granada, Spain. Cd concentrations in adipose tissue were analyzed by High-Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS). Data on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, diet and health status were collected by face-to-face interviews. Predictors of Cd concentrations were assessed by multivariable linear regression with a stepwise variable selection. We found detectable levels of Cd in the adipose tissue of all the study participants, with a mean concentration (±standard deviation) of 12.66 ± 18.91 μg/kg. Smoking habit at recruitment was associated with increased adipose tissue Cd concentrations (β for smokers = 0.669 p < 0.001; β for former smokers = 0.502, p < 0.001; reference = non-smokers). Age was positively associated with Cd concentrations (β = 0.014, p < 0.001), and men showed lower concentrations than women (β = -0.424, p < 0.001). Obesity, measured as Body Mass Index (BMI), showed an inverse association with Cd concentrations (β = -0.038, p < 0.001). Egg consumption ≥2 portions/week (β = 0.241, p = 0.025) was positively associated with Cd concentrations. Perceived exposure to paints was also positively associated with Cd concentrations. The observed associations with age, smoking habit, BMI, and egg and meat consumption did not substantially change after sex/gender stratification. Our results are consistent with currently-known Cd sources and suggest other potential pathways, which might be population-specific.

Maximum concentrations of levamisole were found on the first day after the administration (531.1 μg/kg in liver, 164.3 μg/kg in egg yolk, 130.7 μg/kg in kidney, 78.0 μg/kg in breast muscle, 70.7 μg/kg in thigh muscle and 64.0 μg/kg in egg white), after which there is a decline. The compound was rapidly eliminated from eggs, with a half-life of 1.3 days. Elimination appeared to be slower in thigh muscle (3.5 days), breast muscle (3.4 days) and liver (3.3 days). According to this experiment, the levamisole withdrawal periods calculated for eggs, liver, kidney, breast muscle and thigh muscle in laying hens were 14.1, 6.1, >4.0, 14.5 and 13.0 days, respectively.

The use of high-ohmic resistor enabled the formation of stable electrospray of aqueous solutions at ambient conditions. In addition, corona discharge was avoided even with a high voltage applied. Quantitative analysis of vitamin B in water was successfully conducted by tip-ESI.

The joint effects of formulation and baking conditions on reactivity and several quality aspects (i.e. volatile generation, physical properties, sensory and consumer tests), followed by product optimization (i.e. consumer liking and furan mitigation) were studied. While key markers are affected by all factors and their interactions, the effect of sugar and whole egg are the clearest. Furan would be predominantly generated from glucose via caramelization and/or Maillard reaction, whereas the formation of Strecker aldehydes and lipid oxidation products would be favoured by precursors in whole egg. Formulations with a low glucose content, baked at low temperatures/short times lead to optimal products.

In the present study, egg white hydrolysates of embryonated eggs hatched on the sixth day (EWHD) were segmented consecutively by ultrafiltration membranes with small tangential flow ultrafiltration system. Four segments with more than 30, 30 to 10 kDa, 10 to 5 kDa, and less than 5 kDa of molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) values were separated and were labeled as MWCOI, MWCOII, MWCOIII, and MWCOIV, respectively. The antioxidant activities of segments were investigated by performing DPPH•, •OH radical scavenging, ultra oxygen anion (O2-•), total antioxidant capacity, and reducing power experiments. The results indicated that MWCOI has the strongest scavenging activities on DPPH• radical. However, MWCOIV has the strongest scavenging activities on •OH, O2-•, total antioxidant capacity, and reducing power, which revealed that MWCOIV has strong antioxidant activity. MWCOIV was further separated into 14 fractions via semipreparative reverse-phased high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and their antioxidant activity was evaluated by different antioxidant assays in vitro.

30659485,"The attractive qualities of plastics lead us, around the world, to an enormous need for plastic goods, which results in their unsustainable overconsumption. Bio-based products are the core concept of circular economy, yet this sector suffers from the high cost of their production. In practice, biopolymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA), are still limitedly used, due to their expensiveness and not outstanding technological properties. A circular and sustainable solution would be to use waste from the food industry as filler that contributes to reduce the cost of PLA-based materials, thereby encouraging their widespread use. At the same time, this would be a circular approach to wisely upgrade food waste and prevent pollution. Ceramic food waste powder fillers from egg shells and from mussel shells were compounded with PLA at 180 °C to obtain composites, which contain an unprecedented high amount of filler, equal to 140 over 100 parts of PLA. We analyzed volatile organic compounds emitted from PLA and, for the very first time, from its composites via headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). The molecular fingerprint of the volatiles comprises only three aldehydes, a ketone, and two lactides. Volatiles typical of fossil plastics, that are causative factors of hormone disruption or reproductive dysfunction, are effectively missing.

30571131,"This study investigated gastrointestinal drug concentrations of the weakly acidic drug diclofenac when dosed to healthy volunteers after intake of the FDA standard meal. In gastrointestinal aspiration studies, postprandial conditions are usually achieved using liquid or homogenized meals. However, these liquid meals may have a substantially different impact on the gastrointestinal physiology compared to a solid meal. To evaluate the effect of a solid meal on the gastrointestinal behavior of diclofenac, five healthy volunteers were recruited into a clinical study. Twenty minutes prior to diclofenac ingestion (Cataflam, 50 mg of potassium diclofenac), the volunteers were asked to eat a solid meal with the following composition corresponding to the FDA standard meal: 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, 2 toasts, 4 ounces of hash brown potatoes, and 8 ounces of milk. Gastric and duodenal fluids were collected as a function of time, and blood samples were collected to link the gastrointestinal behavior to systemic exposure. In vivo observations were complemented with in vitro research to obtain a mechanistic understanding of diclofenac's intraluminal behavior. Ingestion of the solid meal resulted in intraluminal pH-profiles similar to earlier studies with a liquid meal. However, intraluminal drug disposition differed. In the stomach, a substantial fraction of diclofenac appeared dissolved, despite an unfavorable acidic pH. Successive in vitro tests suggested that the dissolution of diclofenac is higher in the complex gastric medium resulting from FDA standard meal ingestion compared to liquid meal ingestion. Despite the favorable pH and in contrast to a previous study with a liquid meal, significant amounts of non-dissolved diclofenac were observed in the intestine. Further in vitro tests revealed adsorption of dissolved diclofenac molecules to bacon fragments present in the FDA standard meal. This adsorption negatively affected the permeation of diclofenac across a physical barrier, suggesting that in vivo absorption is affected as well. Being the first time a gastrointestinal aspiration study is combined with the administration of a solid meal, the present study demonstrates that the intraluminal behavior of diclofenac (and possibly other drugs) heavily depends on the consistency and composition of the accompanied meal.",Molecular pharmaceutics,"['D002851', 'D004008', 'D004386', 'D005260', 'D018565', 'D005746', 'D041981', 'D064368', 'D006801', 'D007408', 'D008297', 'D019518', 'D012995', 'D013270', 'D053719', 'D014481', 'D014486']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diclofenac', 'Duodenum', 'Female', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Gastric Emptying', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Male', 'Postprandial Period', 'Solubility', 'Stomach', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",Gastric and Duodenal Diclofenac Concentrations in Healthy Volunteers after Intake of the FDA Standard Meal: In Vivo Observations and in Vitro Explorations.,"[None, 'Q000493', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'pharmacokinetics', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30571131,2019
30528637,"Insects show adaptive plasticity by ingesting plant secondary compounds, such as phenolic compounds, that are noxious to parasites. This work examined whether exposure to phenolic compounds affects the development of insect parasitic nematodes. As a model system for parasitic life cycle, we used Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Rhabditida; Heterorhabditiade) grown with Photorhabdita luminescens supplemented with different concentrations of plant phenolic extracts (0, 600, 1200, 2400 ppm): a crude ethanol extract of lentisk (Pistacia lentiscus) or lentisk extract fractionated along a scale of hydrophobicity with hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate; and flavonoids (myricetin, catechin), flavanol-glycoside (rutin) or phenolic acids (chlorogenic and gallic acids). Resilience of the nematode to phenolic compounds was stage-dependent, with younger growth stages exhibiting less resilience than older growth stages (i.e., eggs < young juveniles < young hermaphrodites < infective juveniles < mature hermaphrodites). At high concentrations, all of the phenolic compounds studied were lethal to eggs and young juveniles. The nematodes were able to survive in the presence of medium and low concentrations of all studied compounds, but very few of those treatments allowed for reproduction beyond the infective juvenile stage and, at low concentrations, the crude 70% ethanol extract, chloroform and hexane extracts, and myricetin were associated with some impaired reproduction. The ethyl-acetate fraction and gallic acid were extremely lethal to the young stages and allowed almost no development beyond the infective juvenile stage. We conclude that exposure of infective juveniles to phenolics before they infect insects and post-infection exposure of other nematode developmental stages may affect the initiation of the infection, suggesting that the chemistry of dietary phenolics may limit H. bacteriophora's infection of insects.",Journal of invertebrate pathology,"['D000818', 'D061046', 'D002851', 'D005419', 'D005707', 'D062385', 'D007313', 'D008018', 'D010572', 'D027927', 'D010936', 'D017168', 'D012987']","['Animals', 'Biological Control Agents', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flavonoids', 'Gallic Acid', 'Hydroxybenzoates', 'Insecta', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Pest Control, Biological', 'Pistacia', 'Plant Extracts', 'Rhabditida', 'Soil']",Toxicity of phenolic compounds to entomopathogenic nematodes: A case study with Heterorhabditis bacteriophora exposed to lentisk (Pistacia lentiscus) extracts and their chemical components.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000633', 'Q000633', 'Q000633', 'Q000469', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'toxicity', 'toxicity', 'toxicity', 'parasitology', 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528637,2020

Mass spectrometry is an alternative to the existing methods, and it can overcome their limitations. One of the first steps in the development of any analytical method is the identification of the analytes to be further studied. In the case of allergen detection by mass spectrometry, the analytes are peptides. In this study, a strategy was developed for identifying potential peptide biomarkers in processed food products. This strategy was applied to processed egg matrices, and 16 potential peptide biomarkers were identified for the further detection and quantification of egg by means of mass spectrometry. With an empirical approach based on dedicated sample preparation, including tandem Lys-C/trypsin enzymatic digestion and high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis, hundreds of peptides from egg proteins were identified. This list of peptides was further refined with a series of criteria, obtained from empirical evidence, to identify the ideal biomarkers for the development of a quantitative method. These criteria include the resistance to food processing and the specificity of the peptides for eggs but also the effects of amino acid modifications and enzymatic digestion efficiency.",Journal of chromatography.

However, traditional DNAzyme biosensors still suffer from fluctuating and relatively high background. Herein, we proposed a temperature-robust DNAzyme, conferring ultralow background in various temperatures, thus leading to highly sensitive and robust detection of metal ions. Instead of labeling substrate to directly output fluorescence signal, our proposed DNAzyme biosensor utilized a sequential detection process with a couple of proximity fluorescent probes, confirming very low background regardless of the conditions of cleavage reaction. This sequential DNAzyme biosensor conferred a signal to background ratio over 20 when the temperature of the catalytic reaction ranged from 20 to 41 °C. Benefitting from its ultralow background, it could confer a detection limit of 0.22 nM, which ranked as one of the highest sensitivity levels among DNAzyme-based fluorescent biosensors.

30419974,"The Paleolithic diet excludes two major sources of fibre, grains and legumes. However, it is not known whether this results in changes to resistant starch (RS) consumption. Serum trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is produced mainly from colonic fermentation and hepatic conversion of animal protein and is implicated in CVD, but changes in RS intake may alter concentrations. We aimed to determine whether intake of RS and serum concentrations of TMAO varied in response to either the Paleolithic or the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) diets and whether this was related to changes in food group consumption. A total of thirty-nine women (mean age 47 (sd 13) years, BMI 27 (sd 4) kg/m2) were randomised to AGHE (n 17) or Paleolithic diets (n 22) for 4 weeks. Serum TMAO concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-MS; food groups, fibre and RS intake were estimated from weighed food records. The change in TMAO concentrations between groups (Paleolithic 3·39 μm v. AGHE 1·19 μm, P = 0·654) did not reach significance despite greater red meat and egg consumption in the Paleolithic group (0·65 serves/d; 95 % CI 0·2, 1·1; P &lt;0·01, and 0·22 serves/d; 95 % CI 0·1, 0·4, P &lt;0·05, respectively). RS intake was significantly lower on the Paleolithic diet (P &lt;0·01) and was not associated with TMAO concentrations. However, the limited data for RS and the small sample size may have influenced these findings.

This improvement enabled specific searches for several hundred target compounds within minutes in complex matrices such as milk, eggs, honey or meat and organs after slaughter.

The EAA content and AA composition of the dietary protein source contribute to the differential muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of different proteins. Lower EAA contents and specific lack of sufficient leucine, lysine, and/or methionine may be responsible for the lower anabolic capacity of plant-based compared with animal-based proteins. We compared EAA contents and AA composition of a large selection of plant-based protein sources with animal-based proteins and human skeletal muscle protein. AA composition of oat, lupin, wheat, hemp, microalgae, soy, brown rice, pea, corn, potato, milk, whey, caseinate, casein, egg, and human skeletal muscle protein were assessed using UPLC-MS/MS. EAA contents of plant-based protein isolates such as oat (21%), lupin (21%), and wheat (22%) were lower than animal-based proteins (whey 43%, milk 39%, casein 34%, and egg 32%) and muscle protein (38%). AA profiles largely differed among plant-based proteins with leucine contents ranging from 5.1% for hemp to 13.5% for corn protein, compared to 9.0% for milk, 7.0% for egg, and 7.6% for muscle protein.

30125763,"Backyard chicken ownership is rapidly increasing in urban areas in the United States, largely as a way to provide eggs for household consumption. Despite elevated levels of environmental lead contamination in many US cities, the role of backyard chicken eggs as a pathway for lead exposure, particularly for children, has received limited scrutiny. To characterize lead exposure from consumption of backyard chicken eggs for children and predict related effects on blood lead level (BLL), we conducted a cross-sectional study of backyard chicken owners in the Greater Boston area (n = 51). We interviewed participants regarding egg consumption by household members and collected backyard eggs (n = 201) and coop soil samples (n = 48) for analysis. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to evaluate lead concentration in homogenized eggs and an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) portable device was used to assess soil lead levels in the laboratory. We used the USEPA's Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model for Lead in Children (IEUBK) to assess the relative contribution of backyard egg consumption to aggregate BLL in children. Four scenarios were developed in the IEUBK model to address variability in egg consumption rates and egg lead contamination. Lead was detected in egg samples from 98% of the households that provided egg samples. Mean household lead concentration was 0.10 μg/g (SD: 0.18). Egg lead concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection (0.0014 μg/g) to 1.798 μg/g (<1.4-1198 ppb). Egg lead levels were strongly positively correlated with lead concentration in coop soil (r = 0.64; p < 0.001). In modeled scenarios where a child < 7 years frequently ate eggs highly contaminated with lead, BLLs are predicted to increase by 0.9-1.5 μg/dL. In three other scenarios reflecting more moderate egg lead contamination and consumption rates, BLLs were predicted to increase from 0.1 to 0.8 μg/dL. Consumption of backyard chicken eggs can contribute to lead exposure in children.

Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by standard methods and separated and identified by gas chromatography. Compared with the Chinese breast milk fatty acid data 10 years ago, SFA and trans fatty acids (TFA) in breast milk decreased, while PUFA increased in the present study. Most SFA (C16:0, C15:0, C14:0), cis-C16:1 and several LC-PUFA (C22:5n-3 and C22:6n-3) were predominantly acylated at the sn-2 position. The cis-C17:1 and C22:6n-3 were distributed equally in three positions of triacylglycerol (TAG). Whereas, TFA, conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), cis-C18:1, C18:2n-6, C18:3n-3 and C20:5n-3 were acylated at the sn-1, 3 positions of TAG in human milk. The composition of fatty acids in breast milk was closely related to the diet of lactating mothers. PUFA in breast milk was negatively correlated with the intake of protein, fat and meat, but positively correlated with the intake of carbohydrates. MUFA of human milk was negatively correlated with the intake of dairy products, eggs, fish and shrimp. SFA in breast milk was positively correlated with the maternal intake of meat.

29679249,"Ivory shell, Babylonia areolata, is one of the commercially important mariculture species in China and South East Asia. Survival varies in the artificial hatching and larval rearing of B. areolata. Food deprivation may be involved in rearing mortality, and so, a better understanding of how larvae respond and adjust to starvation is needed. In this study, the metabolite profiles of newly hatched larvae with yolk (I), larvae with yolk exhaustion (II), larvae suffering 24 h starvation after yolk exhaustion (III), and larvae fed with exogenous nutrients after yolk exhaustion (IV) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Principal component and cluster analyses revealed differential abundance of metabolite profiles across groups. When compared to metabolite levels of the I group, significantly up-regulated metabolites included polyunsaturated fatty acids, phospholipids, nucleotide, amino acids, and their derivatives were found in the II group, indicating that organisms relied predominantly on glycerophospolipid metabolism and protein-based catabolism for energy production during this stage. During starvation after yolk exhaustion, the levels of all energy related metabolites were significantly reduced, but an increase in products of purine and pyrimidine metabolism indicated an insufficient energy supply and an increase in cellular disintegration. Larvae fed exogenous nutrients can have significantly improved metabolism compared to starved larvae. These findings suggest that metabolomics, using LC-MS/MS, can be used to assess the physiological status and food-affected metabolic changes affecting B. areolata larvae.","Marine biotechnology (New York, N.Y.)","['D000818', 'D017756', 'D002853', 'D004032', 'D004530', 'D005508', 'D049851', 'D007814', 'D055442', 'D053719']","['Animals', 'Aquaculture', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Diet', 'Egg Yolk', 'Food Deprivation', 'Gastropoda', 'Larva', 'Metabolome', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","LC-MS/MS-Based Metabolome Analysis of Biochemical Pathways Altered by Food Limitation in Larvae of Ivory Shell, Babylonia areolata.","[None, None, None, 'Q000662', 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000254', 'Q000378', None, None]","[None, None, None, 'veterinary', 'physiology', 'physiology', 'growth & development', 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29679249,2018
29622351,"Proteomics techniques, such as two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and differential gel electrophoresis, have been extensively used to describe the protein composition of male gametes in different animals, mainly mammals. They have also provided a deeper understanding of protein functions involved in sperm processes, as in processes that in humans lead to male infertility. However, few studies focus on fish sperm proteomics and even fewer have tried to explore the proteomic profile of Sturgeon spermatozoa. Sturgeon is an endangered, ancient group of fish species exploited mostly for caviar. In this fish group, a part of the process that leads to final functional maturation of spermatozoa so as to have the capability to activate eggs during the fertilization process. This process has a broad similarity to post-testicular maturation in mammals; where spermatozoa leaving the testes must be mixed with seminal fluid along the transit through the Wolffian ducts to modify its surface membrane protein composition, leading to axonemal and acrosomal competence. The aim of this study was to review the current literature on various proteomic techniques, their usefulness in separating, identifying and studying the proteome composition of the fish spermatozoon, as well as their potential applications in studying the post-testicular maturation process in Sturgeon.

Adult insects may utilize microbial-derived nutrients to prolong their lifespan, promote egg development, and offer a high nutritional substrate to their offspring. Here, we examined the behavioral role of semiochemicals from grape-microbe interactions on oviposition and field attraction of the grapevine moth Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermüller). The volatile constituents released by grape inoculated with yeasts (Hanseniaspora uvarum (Niehaus), Metschnikowia pulcherrima (Pitt.) M.W. Miller, Pichia anomala, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Meyen ex E.C. Hansen, and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (Boutroux) Yarrow), sour rot bacteria (Acetobacter aceti (Pasteur) Beijerinck and Gluconobacter oxydans (Henneberg) De Ley), and a fungal pathogen (Botrytis cinerea Pers.) all endemic of the vineyard were sampled by solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and ethyl acetate were the most common volatiles released from all microbe-inoculated grapes. In addition, acetic acid was released at a substantial amount following bacteria inoculation and in a three-way inoculation with yeasts and the fungus. 2-phenylethanol, a compound reported to attract tortricid moths when used in combination with acetic acid, was found at a relatively low level in all microbial combinations as well as in the control grape. While grapes inoculated with a consortium of yeasts stimulated oviposition in comparison with uninoculated berries, the phytopathogenic fungus deterred egg-laying. Nonetheless, the highest preference to lay eggs was measured when the yeasts were co-inoculated with the fungus. The lowest preference was obtained when grapes were inoculated with sour rot bacteria and their binary co-inoculation with yeasts and the fungus. Interestingly, oviposition on berries simultaneously inoculated with all the three microbial groups was unaffected. Lures loaded with either acetic acid or 2-phenylethanol were not attractive when placed in traps as single component in vineyards, but a binary blend attracted both sexes of grapevine moth in significant numbers. Further addition of the three most common volatiles released by infected berries (ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and ethyl acetate) did not significantly increase moth catch with this binary blend.

This study fills this gap and provides a comprehensive picture of the peptides present in the yolk plasma of different hen egg types after 24 and 264 h of laying, taking advantage of a procedure based on a two-step fractionation followed by combined MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS- and nanoLC-ESI-Q-Orbitrap-MS/MS-based analysis.

Furthermore, dynamic rheology experiments indicated ovalbumin led to a decrease inG' andG″ of dough.

29501128,"Tetracyclines are widely used for both the treatment and prevention of diseases in animals as well as for the promotion of rapid animal growth and weight gain. This practice may result in trace amounts of these drugs in products of animal origin, such as milk and eggs, posing serious risks to human health. The presence of tetracycline residues in foods can lead to the transmission of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria through the food chain. In order to ensure food safety and avoid exposure to these substances, national and international regulatory agencies have established tolerance levels for authorized veterinary drugs, including tetracycline antimicrobials. In view of that, numerous sensitive and specific methods have been developed for the quantification of these compounds in different food matrices. One will note, however, that the determination of trace residues in foods such as milk and eggs often requires extensive sample extraction and preparation prior to conducting instrumental analysis. Sample pretreatment is usually the most complicated step in the analytical process and covers both cleaning and pre-concentration. Optimal sample preparation can reduce analysis time and sources of error, enhance sensitivity, apart from enabling unequivocal identification, confirmation and quantification of target analytes. The development and implementation of more environmentally friendly analytical procedures, which involve the use of less hazardous solvents and smaller sample sizes compared to traditional methods, is a rapidly increasing trend in analytical chemistry.

In order to check its advantages and limitations it was developed a method to identify and quantify 164 pesticides in three different matrices (tomato, orange and leek). A carbon dioxide gradient with methanol (containing 1 mM ammonium formate) was used allowing a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min that made the total run time of 12 min without any problem of overpressure. Addition of a post column flow 150 μL/min of Methanol with ammonium formate/formic acid was necessary to improve the ionization. The matrix effect study revealed that the percentages of pesticides with irrelevant matrix effect (suppression lower than 20%) was 99% in tomato, 87% in orange and 62% in leek, whereas significant suppression (higher than 50%) was not found in tomato and only 1% of the compounds in orange and 3% in leek.These results compare favorably with that typically obtained in LC-MS/MS. The absence of water in the mobile phase, also provided some important advantages regarding LC-MS/MS as (i) higher retention of polar compounds in the column, which elute with high sensitivity and good peak shape and (ii) a general increase of the sensitivity of the analysis, consequence of the high ionization and ion extraction efficiency. Pesticides evaluated were identified following the SANTE/11813/2017. At the spiking concentration of 5 μg/kg, 98% of the pesticides were identified in tomato, 98% in orange and 94% in leek, whereas for the concentration of 10 μg/kg all the compounds were identified in tomato and only spiromesifen was not identified in orange and leek. At the concentration of 20 μg/kg, spiromesifen was also identified in these two matrices. The linearity and reproducibility of the method were evaluated with results which guarantee high quality in the analytical measurements. Even though only 2 μL of final extract were injected, the sensitivity of the SFC method was enough to achieve stringent LOQs.Real samples, including 6 different fruits and vegetables, were analyzed by the SFC-MS/MS proposed method, the results being similar to those obtained by LC-MS/MS.

In this investigation, performance provided by a high resolution (HR) hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap™ MS platform for the multiple allergens detection in processed food matrix is presented. In particular, three different acquisition modes were compared: full-MS, targeted-selected ion monitoring with data-dependent fragmentation (t-SIM/dd2), and parallel reaction monitoring. In order to challenge the HR-MS platform, the sample preparation was kept as simple as possible, limited to a 30-min ultrasound-aided protein extraction followed by clean-up with disposable size exclusion cartridges. Selected peptide markers tracing for five allergenic ingredients namely skim milk, whole egg, soy flour, ground hazelnut, and ground peanut were monitored in home-made cookies chosen as model processed matrix. Timed t-SIM/dd2 was found the best choice as a good compromise between sensitivity and accuracy, accomplishing the detection of 17 peptides originating from the five allergens in the same run.

29389948,"Multiplex serological immunoassays, such as implemented on microarray or microsphere-based platforms, provide greater information content and higher throughput, while lowering the cost and blood volume required. These features are particularly attractive in pediatric food allergy testing to facilitate high throughput multi-allergen analysis from finger- or heel-stick collected blood. However, the miniaturization and microfluidics necessary for creating multiplex assays make them highly susceptible to the ""matrix effect"" caused by interference from non-target agents in serum and other biofluids. Such interference can result in lower sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and quantitative accuracy. These problems have in large part prevented wide-spread implementation of multiplex immunoassays in clinical laboratories. We report the development of a novel method to eliminate the matrix effect by utilizing photocleavable capture antibodies to purify and concentrate blood-based biomarkers (a process termed PC-PURE) prior to detection in a multiplex immunoassay. To evaluate this approach, it was applied to blood-based allergy testing. Patient total IgE was purified and enriched using PC-PURE followed by multiplex microsphere-based detection of allergen-specific IgEs (termed the AllerBead assay). AllerBead was formatted to detect the eight most common pediatric food allergens: milk, soy, wheat, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fin fish and shellfish, which account for >90% of all pediatric food allergies. 205 serum samples obtained from Boston Children's Hospital were evaluated. When PC-PURE was employed with AllerBead, excellent agreement was obtained with the standard, non-multiplex, ImmunoCAP® assay (average sensitivity above published negative predictive cutoffs = 96% and average Pearson r = 0.90; average specificity = 97%). In contrast, poor ImmunoCAP®-correlation was observed when PC-PURE was not utilized (average sensitivity above published negative predictive cutoffs = 59% and average Pearson r = 0.61; average specificity = 97%).

Lipids can exist as any one of a large number of double bond positional isomers, which are indistinguishable by single-stage mass spectrometry alone. Ozonolysis reactions coupled to mass spectrometry have previously been demonstrated as a means for localizing double bonds in unsaturated lipids. Here we describe an online, solution-phase reactor using ozone produced via a low-pressure mercury lamp, which generates aldehyde products diagnostic of cleavage at a particular double bond position. This flow-cell device is utilized in conjunction with structurally selective ion mobility-mass spectrometry. The lamp-mediated reaction was found to be effective for multiple lipid species in both positive and negative ionization modes, and the conversion efficiency from precursor to product ions was tunable across a wide range (20-95%) by varying the flow rate through the ozonolysis device. Ion mobility separation of the ozonolysis products generated additional structural information and revealed the presence of saturated species in a complex mixture. The method presented here is simple, robust, and readily coupled to existing instrument platforms with minimal modifications necessary. For these reasons, application to standard lipidomic workflows is possible and aids in more comprehensive structural characterization of a myriad of lipid species.",Analytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D002853', 'D004531', 'D005231', 'D020404', 'D007536', 'D008055', 'D010126', 'D021241']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Eggs', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Glycerophospholipids', 'Isomerism', 'Lipids', 'Ozone', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Determining Double Bond Position in Lipids Using Online Ozonolysis Coupled to Liquid Chromatography and Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry.,"[None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","[None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29341601,2019
29340658,"Food safety of table eggs is vital since many pathogens can contaminate the unfertilized egg, leading to increased risk of foodborne illness for consumers. The eggshell cuticle is the first line of defense to restrict the entry of egg-associated pathogens, such as Salmonella Enteritidis. The thickness and completeness of coverage of the cuticle layer are heritable traits that are strongly associated with egg resistance to bacterial penetration. The present study characterizes the chemical composition of the eggshell cuticle and structure of pore plugs from table eggs. Eggs collected from both brown and white egg laying Lohmann flocks (early, mid, and late lay) were either unwashed or washed. Pore plugs were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and elemental composition was determined using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). SEM observations confirmed that the plug formed by the cuticle layer within the eggshell pore remains firmly lodged throughout the commercial washing process. The eggshell thickness and cuticle pore length visualized in brown eggs was significantly higher than in white eggs in hens of all ages. EDS analysis revealed that the pore inner surface was enriched in phosphorus and chemically different from the surrounding bulk eggshell mineral. Detailed assessment of the cuticle chemical composition was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Washing of eggs removed cuticle from the eggshell surface. There was a trend of lower cuticle coverage with increasing hen age for white eggs. A significant reduction in the amount of proteins and phosphates and polysaccharides was observed in the cuticle of brown unwashed eggs with hen age. In white unwashed eggs, amides and lipids decreased with hen age; by contrast, the amount of sulfate was highest at mid-lay.

The present study was undertaken to investigate vitellin of C. ariakensis (CAVt). Vitellin is an essential component of egg proteins in marine invertebrates as it provides energy and nutrients to the embryo and larvae. CAVt was purified from eggs of the oyster using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by affinity chromatography with Concanavalin A-agarose. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and sodium dodecyl sulfate PAGE showed that CAVt is a high molecular weight [532 kiloDaltons (kDa)] protein, with multiple subunits. Similar to other vitellin proteins, it is a phospholipoglycoprotein composed of phospholipids (12.06%), carbohydrates (mannose, 10.08% or glucose, 9.84%), and alkali-labile phosphates (4.16%). Affinity chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent aasay (ELISA) and western blot analysis revealed that CAVt is only present in the ovary, and two subunits of CAVt (72 and 35 kDa) are believed to be incorporated from the hemolymph into the oocyte. The antibody specific to CAVt (anti-CAVt), raised in rabbit, strongly cross reacted with the egg proteins of oyster species and scallops, suggesting that the antigenic epitopes are highly conserved among species.

This study delivered the first proteomic portraits of egg quality in zebrafish, a leading biomedical model for early development. Egg batches of good and poor quality, evidenced by embryo survival for 24 h, were sampled immediately after spawning and used to create pooled or replicated sample sets whose protein extracts were subjected to different levels of fractionation before liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Obtained spectra were searched against a zebrafish proteome database and detected proteins were annotated, categorized and quantified based on normalized spectral counts. Manually curated and automated enrichment analyses revealed poor quality eggs to be deficient of proteins involved in protein synthesis and energy and lipid metabolism, and of some vitellogenin products and lectins, and to have a surfeit of proteins involved in endo-lysosomal activities, autophagy, and apoptosis, and of some oncogene products, lectins and egg envelope proteins. Results of pathway and network analyses suggest that this aberrant proteomic profile results from failure of oocytes giving rise to poor quality eggs to properly transit through final maturation, and implicated Wnt signaling in the etiology of this defect. Quantitative comparisons of abundant proteins in good versus poor quality eggs revealed 17 candidate egg quality markers.

There are considerable proofs that PLs have unique nutritional benefits on human health, such as reducing cholesterol absorption, improving liver functions, and decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. PLs are the main structural lipid components of cell and organelle membranes in all living organisms, and therefore, they occur in all organisms and the derived food products. PLs are distinguished by the presence of a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, consequently they possess amphiphilic features. Due to their unique characteristics, the extraction, separation, and identification of PLs are critical issues to be concerned. This review is focused on the content of PLs classes in several sources (including milk, vegetable oils, egg yolk, and mitochondria). As well, it highlights PLs biosynthesis, and the methodologies applied for PLs extraction and separation, such as solvent extraction and solid-phase extraction.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a promising alternative to commonly employed antibody-based assays owing to its ability to quantify multiple proteins in complex matrices with high sensitivity. In this review, we discuss a targeted MS workflow for the quantitation of allergenic protein in food products that employs selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We highlight the aspects of SRM method development unique to allergen quantitation and identify opportunities for simplifying the process. One promising avenue identified through a comprehensive survey of published MS literature is the use of proteotypic peptides, which are peptides whose presence appears robust to variations in food matrix, sample preparation protocol, and MS instrumentation. We conclude that proteotypic peptides exist for a subset of allergenic milk, egg, and peanut proteins. For less studied allergens such as soy, wheat, fish, shellfish, and tree nuts, we offer guidance and tools for peptide selection and specificity verification as part of an interactive web database, the Allergen Peptide Browser (http://www.AllergenPeptideBrowser.org).

This study examines the effects of plant age on female oviposition preference and offspring performance in the large cabbage white butterfly Pieris brassicae. Adult female butterflies lay variable clusters of eggs on the underside of short-lived annual species in the family Brassicaceae, including the short-lived annuals Brassica nigra and Sinapis arvensis, which are important food plants for P. brassicae in The Netherlands. Here, we compared oviposition preference and larval performance of P. brassicae on three age classes (young, mature, and pre-senescing) of B. nigra and S. arvensis plants. Oviposition preference of P. brassicae declined with plant age in both plant species. Whereas larvae performed similarly on all three age classes in B. nigra, preference and performance were weakly correlated in S. arvensis. Analysis of primary (sugars and amino acids) and secondary (glucosinolates) chemistry in the plant shoots revealed that differences in their quality and quantity were more pronounced with respect to tissue type (leaves vs. flowers) than among different developmental stages of both plant species.

Results showed that the presence of CMV in chilli plants substantially affects the settling preferences of the B. tabaci, which preferred to settle on noninfected plants.

In contrast, the developmental time from egg to adult was significantly reduced in CMV-infected chilli plants compared to the noninfected plants. The results also showed that CMV-infected chilli plants released significantly more linalool and phenylacetaldehyde than noninfected plants. Overall, it was suggested that the behavioral response of B. tabaci might be modified by CMV-infected plants, which alter the release of specific headspace volatiles.

28586212,"The colonization of decomposing remains by necrophagous insects such as blow flies is of forensic importance because the progression through the various stages of insect development can be correlated to time of death. The ability to infer this information hinges on accurate determination of the fly species that are associated with the entomological evidence collected. This evidence can include eggs, larvae, pupae, and puparial casings. Determination of the egg's identity is particularly challenging because the eggs of multiple species are morphologically very similar. We report here that the species identity of fly eggs can be determined from their chemical fingerprint signatures acquired by direct analysis in real time high-resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS). Thus, freshly laid eggs were collected and readily distinguished from multiple necrophagous fly species in the Manhattan area of New York City. These species included representatives from the blow fly family (Calliphoridae), specifically Calliphora vicina, Lucilia sericata, L. coeruleiviridis, and Phormia regina species as well as the Phoridae and Sarcophagidae families. Multivariate statistical analysis of their observed DART-HRMS spectra revealed intraspecies similarities and interspecies differences that were the basis of species differentiation. The chemical basis of discrimination was differences in amino acid profiles. This represents the first chemically based fly egg identification approach with applications to forensic entomology.

28482314,"Several eel species of the genus Anguilla are considered endangered due to a severe decline in recruitment. Up to now, the reasons for this threatening development are not fully understood. The eel's highly specialized biology can lead to explicitly high accumulation of globally distributed organic lipophilic contaminants during its continental life. Because of this and due the particular toxicological sensitivity of early life stages of oviparous organisms towards dioxin-like compounds, it is crucial to improve our understanding concerning toxicokinetics and maternal transfer of organic contaminants in eels. This study presents analytical data on maternal transfer of dioxin-like (dl) compounds in relevant tissue samples taken from artificially matured and non-matured European silver eels (Anguilla anguilla) from German inland waters using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS). Detected concentrations revealed a lipid-driven transfer of targeted compounds from muscle-fat-reserves to gonads and eggs respectively, with no distinct preferences concerning the chlorination degree of targeted compounds. Dl-PCBs were shown to contribute the major share of toxicity equivalents found in analysed eel tissues. Maternal muscle tissue to egg concentration ratios in wet weight-based samples had a mean of 6.95 ± 1.49 in accordance with the differences in total lipid content in the respective body matrices. Dioxins and furans in analysed samples were (from a toxicological point of view) of less relevance.

Egg yolk lipid composition changes depending on different conditions associated with hens raising. Therefore, the purpose of our work was to use a lipidomic approach as a tool to evaluate if different diets (vegetable versus animal) and raising environments (free range versus indoor) interfere in the triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipid (PL) profiles of eggs' yolks and to use such differences to differentiate eggs according to their origin. To achieve that goal, total lipid extracts were obtained and then fractionated by solid-phase chromatography. TAGs fraction was analysed by ESI-MS and PLs fraction by HILIC-LC-MS/MS. TAG and five PL classes were identified, namely PC, LPC, PE, LPE and SM. Fatty acids (FA) esterified to the glycerol backbone of PL ranged between C16:0 and C22:6. On the other hand, FA esterified to TAG ranged from C14:0 to C20:0. Major differences on the PL profile were observed regarding eggs from free-range hens and fed with vegetable origin food and eggs from the remaining conditions, once the former presented higher levels of PC (O-34:0), PC (34:1) and PE (34:1).

28444375,"In order to evaluate the efficiency of the pasteurization process in liquid whole eggs, an UV/visible spectrophotometric method was developed and validated for the assessment of alpha-amylase activity. Samples were collected from 30 lots of raw eggs (n = 30) and divided into three groups: one was reserved for analysis of the raw eggs, the second group was pasteurized at 61.1°C for 3.5 minutes (n = 30), and the third group was pasteurized at 64.4°C for 2.5 minutes (n = 30). In addition to assessing alpha-amylase activity, the microbiological quality of the samples was also evaluated by counting total and thermotolerant coliforms, mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, Staphylococcus spp., and Salmonella spp. The validated spectrophotometric method demonstrated linearity, with a coefficient of determination (R2) greater than 0.99, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 0.48 mg kg-1 and 1.16 mg kg-1, respectively, and acceptable precision and accuracy with relative standard deviation (RSD) values of less than 10% and recovery rates between 98.81% and 105.40%. The results for alpha-amylase activity in the raw egg samples showed high enzyme activity due to near-complete hydrolysis of the starch, while in the eggs pasteurized at 61.1°C, partial inactivation of the enzyme was observed. In the samples of whole eggs pasteurized at 64.4°C, starch hydrolysis did not occur due to enzyme inactivation.

However, the mechanism by which DHA-PL from P. crocea roe exerts these effects has not yet been illuminated. Herein, we investigated the underlying molecular action of DHA-PL by examining changes in liver protein expression in control, hyperlipidemic, and DHA-PL-treated mice. A total of 16 proteins, 9 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated, were identified and classified into several metabolic pathways, such as fat digestion and absorption, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) signaling, and antigen processing and presentation; the largest functional class found was that of fat digestion and absorption. We revealed Apoa1 to be a biomarker of DHA-PL effects on hyperlipidemic mice by DHA-PL diet.

28208834,"Vitamin D deficiency is a global concern. Much research has concentrated on the endogenous synthesis of vitamin D in human skin following exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-315 nm). In many regions of the world there is insufficient UV-B radiation during winter months for adequate vitamin D production, and even when there is sufficient UV-B radiation, lifestyles and concerns about the risks of sun exposure may lead to insufficient exposure and to vitamin D deficiency. In these situations, dietary intake of vitamin D from foods or supplements is important for maintaining optimal vitamin D status. Some foods, such as fatty fish and fish liveroils, certain meats, eggs, mushrooms, dairy, and fortified foods, can provide significant amounts of vitamin D when considered cumulatively across the diet. However, little research has focussed on assessing edible plant foods for potential vitamin D content. The biosynthesis of vitamin D in animals, fungi and yeasts is well established; it is less well known that vitamin D is also biosynthesised in plants. Research dates back to the early 1900s, beginning with in vivo experiments showing the anti-rachitic activity of plants consumed by animals with induced rickets, and in vitro experiments using analytical methods with limited sensitivity. The most sensitive, specific and reliable method for measuring vitamin D and its metabolites is by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These assays have only recently been customised to allow measurement in foods, including plant materials.

In the present study, we performed quantitative proteomics analysis with iTRAQ technology in the shell gland epithelium of hens laying dark and light brown eggs to investigate the candidate proteins and molecular mechanisms underlying variation in chicken eggshell brownness. The results indicated 147 differentially expressed proteins between these two groups, among which 65 and 82 proteins were significantly up-regulated in the light and dark groups, respectively. Functional analysis indicated that in the light group, the down-regulated iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein (Iba57) would decrease the synthesis of protoporphyrin IX; furthermore, the up-regulated protein solute carrier family 25 (mitochondrial carrier; adenine nucleotide translocator), member 5 (SLC25A5) and down-regulated translocator protein (TSPO) would lead to increased amounts of protoporphyrin IX transported into the mitochondria matrix to form heme with iron, which is supplied by ovotransferrin protein (TF). In other words, chickens from the light group produce less protoporphyrin IX, which is mainly used for heme synthesis. Therefore, the exported protoporphyrin IX available for eggshell deposition and brownness is reduced in the light group.

In this study, we developed a multiresidue method for screening over 100 veterinary drug residues using ion trap (IT)-ToF/MS. The screened compounds comprised major drug classes used in veterinary practice, representing the following: amphenicols, anthelmintics, benzimidazoles, β-lactams, coccidiostats, ionophores, macrolides, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, quinolones, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and tranquilizers. The method was developed based on chromatographic retention time, specific accurate mass, isotope distribution, and fragment data. Each compound was validated at three levels, and the mass accuracy, accuracy, and repeatability were calculated. All parameters showed acceptable values and conformed to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria.

MSIA is based on an immunoaffinity enrichment procedure combined with targeted MS/MS detection of selected egg peptide markers. Polyclonal antibodies raised against native ovalbumin, chosen as the target protein tracing for egg powder, were immobilized onto low backpressure monolithic MSIA customized disposable tips. Ovalbumin-free wine samples were fortified with standard protein at different concentrations in the low microgram-per-milliliter range. A simple protocol was devised consisting of a 1:4 dilution of the wine sample with a basic solution for pH adjustment, followed by a semi-automated purification/enrichment step on MSIA customized disposable tips fitted on a multichannel electronic pipette. Among the main figures of merit, LOD and LOQ values as low as 0.01 and 0.03 μg/mL, respectively, and within-day precision of 18% should be noticed. Noteworthy, the developed assay outperformed current MS-based methods for the detection of allergenic protein in wine matrices, thanks to the immunoaffinity enrichment.

The remainder was incubated normally and used as diploid controls. Specimens of eyed embryos and fry were taken on 18 and 76 days post-fertilization, respectively. In the eyed embryo extracts, seven protein spots were significantly changed in abundance between the control and heat-shocked groups and one of these was decreased while the others were increased in the heat shock-treated group. Of the spots that were shown to change in abundance in the eyed embryos with heat shock treatment, two were identified as vitellogenin, while the others were creatine kinase and angiotensin I. In the 2-DE from the fry muscle extraction, 23 spots were significantly changed in abundance between the diploid and triploid groups. Nineteen of these showed a decreased abundance in diploids, while the remaining four spots had an increased abundance. Triploidization caused differential expression of muscle metabolic proteins including triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and beta-enolase. Myosin heavy chain as a structural protein was also found to change in abundance in triploids.

The method validation was carried out in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery and limits of detection and quantification. The method was applied for simultaneous quantification of the two xanthophylls in eggs of rainbow trout and brook trout after their selective extraction. The results show that astaxanthin accumulations in salmonid fish eggs are larger than those of canthaxanthin.

Utilization of [C4MIM][NPA] in FIL-NOSM method increased extraction recoveries (ERs) of TCs by more than 20% and eliminated the pH adjustment step because of its strong acidity. Under optimized conditions based on central composite design, the ERs of four TCs were 94.1-102.1%, and the limitsofdetection were 0.08-1.12μgkg(-1) in milk and egg samples. This proposed method provides high extraction efficiency, less pretreatment time and requires non-organic solvents for determination of trace TC concentrations in complex animal-based food matrices.

27432235,"This study aimed to develop a simpler method for determining total mercury (T-Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in biological samples by using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) in the degreasing step. The fat in the samples was extracted by MIBK to the upper phase. T-Hg transferred into the water phase. This was followed by the extraction of MeHg from the water phase using HBr, CuCl2 and toluene. The MeHg fraction was reverse-extracted into L-cysteine-sodium acetate solution from toluene. The concentrations of T-Hg and MeHg were determined by heating vaporization atomic absorption spectrometry. Certified reference materials for T-Hg and MeHg in hair and fish were accurately measured using this method. This method was then applied to determine T-Hg and MeHg concentrations in the muscle, liver and gonads of seafood for the risk assessment of MeHg exposure. The mean T-Hg and MeHg concentrations in squid eggs were 0.023 and 0.022 µg/g, and in squid nidamental glands 0.052 and 0.049 µg/g, respectively. The MeHg/T-Hg ratios in the eggs and nidamental glands of squid were 94.4% and 96.5%, respectively. The mean T-Hg and MeHg concentrations in the gonads of sea urchins were 0.043 and 0.001 µg/g, respectively, with a MeHg/T-Hg ratio of 3.5%. We developed an efficient analytical method for T-Hg and MeHg using MIBK in the degreasing step.

The leafworm causes serious economic losses to farmers because the shipments are intercepted at the detection sites. The identification and subsequent synthesis of the sex pheromone compounds can lead to the use of semiochemicals as an important strategy to complement the pest management. This paper identifies and characterizes the chemical components of the female sexual gland of C. uncilata at three different age stages in order to relate the effect of age on the gland extract composition. Eggs and larvae were collected from commercial crops. The specimens were reared and sexed. Pheromone glands of intact females were excised at (a) 1-2, (b) 3-4, and (c) 5-6 days old. The extracts were analyzed using GC-MS after two extraction time points: 20 min and 8 days. The extracts from the third age stage showed an increase in concentration for 35% of the compounds after 8 days of storage. The relative abundance as a function of the female age showed two trends: an upward trend, where the relative abundances of the compounds increased through the age stages, while some compounds shown a downward trend. Within the first trend, mostly of the compounds were found to be related with infochemicals type structures, where tetradec-9-en-1-yl acetate (within several C-14 long-chain alcohols) is the main one.

The present study is the first to estimate the lead dietary exposure of Shenzhen adults (≥ 20 years old) in various age-gender subgroups, and to assess the associated health risk. Food samples that represented the Shenzhen people's dietary pattern were collected and prepared for analysis. Lead was determined in 13 food groups using 276 individual cooked samples by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Dietary exposures were estimated by combining the analytical results with the local food consumption data of Shenzhen adults. The mean and 95th percentile lead exposure of Shenzhen adults were 0.59-0.73 and 0.75-0.94 μg kg(-1) bw day(-1), respectively. In all food groups, the highest lead exposure was from 'Eggs and their products' (42.4-51.6% of the total exposure); preserved eggs being the main contributor. The other major contributors to lead exposure of Shenzhen adults were 'Fish and seafood, and their products' (14.3-16.7% of the total exposure) and 'Vegetables and their products' (15.5-16.2% of the total exposure). The margin of exposure (MOE) approach was used for the risk assessment of lead, and the results showed that the risk was considered to be low in all age-gender groups for Shenzhen adults.

However current diagnostic tests are based on ELISA and/or Western blot using native antigens needing laboratory facilities not available in rural areas. Development of a pen side diagnostic test for swines, makes sense. Immunochromatographic test should be adapted for this purpose. To design it we started a bio-guided identification of new proteins in cysticercus fluid. Proteins were analyzed using ion exchange chromatography and 2D separation and were selected by Western blot analysis using sera from infected/non infected pigs. Spots from the Coomassie-stained gel corresponding to these proteins were then analyzed by mass spectroscopy and proteins were identified using a bank of Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) of T. solium. Eighteen new proteins of interest were identified and nine were selected for further development.

26992495,"Sterols/oxysterols in food may be free or bound i.e. esterified with fatty acids. Methods commonly applied to determine those compounds in such matrices (based on various analytical techniques) usually start with hydrolysis of the food lipid fraction, which means that the results are no good indication of concentration of free sterols/oxysterols only. But only free oxysterols are proatherogenic factors, bound ones are not. There are some published methods selectively sensitive to free oxysterols only, but they are capable to determine only a few compounds and feature very low recovery rates. The aim of this work was to develop a method to determine various free (non-esterified) sterols/oxysterols in various food matrices. The developed method is based on the GC-IT-MS technique used in the chemical ionization mode. It was applied to determine 16 different free sterols/oxysterols in egg powder, cheese, butter, milk and salami. Fat extracted from the given matrix is purified on a specially prepared silica-gel bed to separate the sterol fraction from the oxysterol one. Sterols are silylated using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and trimethylchlorosilane BSTFA:TMCS, then GC-IT-MS analysed. The method features high recovery rates (75-95%), high reproducibility (RSD<20%), and sensitivity within the 0.01-0.3 mg 100 g(-1) range, depending on the analysed compound. The method is ideally suited for determination of free sterols/oxysterols.

Proportions of arsenic metabolites (%iAs, %MMA and %DMA) in urine were modelled in OLS regressions as functions of food groups, dietary patterns, nutrient intake, and nutritional status. Exposure to arsenic was low (median U-As: 9.9µg/L) and household water (water As: median 0.45µg/L) was not a major contributor to exposure. Children with higher consumption of rice had higher U-As but lower %iAs, %MMA, and higher %DMA. Children with higher meat consumption had lower %iAs and higher %DMA. Higher scores on ""nutrient dense"" dietary pattern were related to lower %iAs and %MMA, and higher %DMA. Higher intake of dietary folate was associated with lower %MMA and higher %DMA. Overweight children had lower %MMA and higher %DMA than normal-weight children. In summary, rice was an important predictor of exposure to inorganic arsenic and DMA.

Eggs and milt were taken from eight females and six males. The gametes were pooled to minimize the individual differences. After insemination, the eggs were incubated at 10°C for 10min. Half of the fertilized eggs were then subjected to heat shock for 10min submerged in a 28°C water bath to induce triploidy. The remainder were incubated normally and used as diploid controls. Three batches of eggs were randomly selected from each group and were incubated at 10-11°C under the same environmental conditions in hatchery troughs until the fry stage. Triplicate samples of 30 eggs (10 eggs per trough) from each group were randomly selected 1.5h post-fertilization for proteome extraction. Egg proteins were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Based on the results from the statistical analyses, 15 protein spots were found to decrease significantly in abundance in heat-shock treated group and were selected for identification. Out of 15 protein spots showing altered abundance, 14 spots were successfully identified. All of the egg proteins identified in our study were related to vitellogenin (vtg). Decreased abundance of vitellogenin in heat-shock treated eggs in our study may either be explained by (i) higher utilization of vtg as an effect of increased cell size in triploids or (ii) changed metabolism in response to heat-shock stress and (iii) diffusion of vtg through chorion due to incidence of egg shell damage. Decreased abundance of vitellogenin in heat-shock treated eggs was associated with reduced early survival rates and lowered growth performance of triploid fish.",Animal reproduction science,"['D000818', 'D005260', 'D018869', 'D006358', 'D008297', 'D017686', 'D011123', 'D020543', 'D040901', 'D015053']","['Animals', 'Female', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Hot Temperature', 'Male', 'Oncorhynchus mykiss', 'Polyploidy', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Zygote']",Proteome changes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fertilized eggs as an effect of triploidization heat-shock treatment.,"[None, None, 'Q000502', None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'physiology', None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26774351,2016

In this context, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are of particular concern due to their endocrine-disrupting nature. The aims of this study were to provide additional baseline data on PCB and PBDE concentrations in eggs of Dermochelys coriacea; and to investigate whether any of the congeners could compromise reproductive success in this species. A total of 18 nests from different females were studied during the nesting season of 2008 at Reserva Pacuare Beach, in the Caribbean side of Costa Rica. Reproductive parameters (viability, fertility and hatching rates) were calculated for all nests and hatchling morphometrics were successfully measured in 8 of them. Two to three fresh eggs per nest were taken for contaminant study. Different congeners of POPs were purified and identified using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to an ion trap detector (GC-ITD MS/MS), as described below. Mean ± SD concentrations were calculated for POP congeners within each nest and clustering was also evaluated. Correlations were performed searching for potential relationships with reproductive parameters. POP levels were similar to those reported in French-Guiana populations and slightly lower than those associated to Florida populations. Sum of PBDEs showed a negative correlation to the hatching success, suggesting potential harmful effects of these contaminants on the reproduction of leatherbacks.",Chemosphere,"['D000818', 'D003364', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D005260', 'D008401', 'D055768', 'D010063', 'D011078', 'D012098', 'D053719', 'D014426']","['Animals', 'Costa Rica', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Female', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers', 'Ovum', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Reproduction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Turtles']",Persistent organic pollutant levels in eggs of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) point to a decrease in hatching success.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26735737,2016

In this study, we used RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence to detect the expression of recombinant human lysozyme (rhLY) in the transgenic chicken. We demonstrated that the transgene of rhLY was genetically stable across different generations. We next optimized the purification procedure of rhLY from the transgenic eggs by utilizing two steps of cation-exchange chromatography and one gel-filtration chromatography. About 6 mg rhLY with the purity exceeding 90% was obtained from ten eggs, and the purification efficiency was about 75%. The purified rhLY had similar physicochemical and biological properties in molecular mass and antibacterial activity compared to the commercial human lysozyme. Additionally, both of them exhibited thermal stability at 60°C and tolerated an extensive pH range of 2 to 11. In conclusion, our study proved that the transgenic chickens we have previously generated were genetically stable and suitable for the production of active rhLY.

26677025,"Two miniaturized extraction methods for a wide range of 2-6 ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated homologues in small lipid-rich biota samples (≤100 mg) have been developed. Both methods utilize liquid extraction (LE) prior to a clean-up step using either normal phase solid phase extraction (SPE) or mixed-phase dispersive SPE (dSPE). Optimization of the methods was achieved by comparing the type and amount of sorbents, drying agents, and solvents used. In order to improve the limits of detection (LOD) of target PAHs under high sensitivity gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, specific emphasis was given to minimizing lipid co-extraction. The optimized LE-SPE method comprised extraction with dichloromethane/n-hexane (1:1, v/v) and clean-up by silica SPE, whereas the optimized LE-dSPE method comprised extraction with acetonitrile and clean-up with PSA and C18 sorbents. The methods were validated and directly compared through the analysis of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) eggs exposed to oil. The LE-SPE method resulted in lower levels of co-extracted lipids (14.1 ± 1.7 ng/μL) than the LE-dSPE method (60 ± 14 ng/μL). Achieved PAH LODs for the LE-SPE method were typically an order of magnitude lower (<5 ng/g) than for the LE-dSPE method (<125 ng/g).

Egg treatment groups included a low-MeHg dose of 0.2 μg Hg g(-1) egg (n = 36), a high-MeHg dose of 3.2 μg Hg g(-1) egg (n = 49), and a control (n = 34). Doses were dissolved in nanopure filtered water and injected into the albumen on the day eggs showed signs of viability (3 d incubation). In ovo exposure to MeHg significantly reduced hatching success (53% in the high-MeHg dose group vs 94% in vehicle controls). Among hatched chicks, however, no effects of MeHg on growth, hematological variables, or nestling survival were detected. While the in ovo injection method resulted in a dose-dependent pattern of MeHg concentrations in blood of surviving chicks at 15 d and 30 d posthatching, there was evidence of rapid excretion of MeHg with nestling age during that growth period. At reproductive maturity (90 d of age), no long-term effects of in ovo exposure to MeHg on female mating behavior, reproductive effort (egg or clutch size), or growth and survivorship of offspring were observed.

26475102,"Snake venom protein from Deinagkistrodon acutus (DA protein), one of the major venomous species in Taiwan, causes hemorrhagic symptoms that can lead to death. Although horse-derived antivenin is a major treatment, relatively strong and detrimental side effects are seen occasionally. In our study, yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) was purified from eggs, and DA protein was recognized using Western blotting and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), similar to therapeutic horse antivenin. The ELISA also indicated that specific IgY antibodies were elicited after the fifth booster, plateaued, and lasted for at least 3 months. To generate monoclonal single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies, we used phage display technology to construct two libraries with short or long linkers, containing 6.24 × 10(8) and 5.28 × 10(8) transformants, respectively. After four rounds of biopanning, the eluted phage titer increased, and the phage-based ELISA indicated that the specific clones were enriched. Nucleotide sequences of 30 individual clones expressing scFv were analyzed and classified into four groups that all specifically recognized the DA venom protein. Furthermore, based on mass spectrometry, the scFv-bound protein was deduced to be snake venom metalloproteinase proteins. Most importantly, both IgY and mixed scFv inhibited the lethal effect in mice injected with the minimum lethal dosage of the DA protein. We suggest that together, these antibodies could be applied to the development of diagnostic agents or treatments for snakebite envenomation in the future.

26449817,"Plant volatile organic compounds play a role in selection of host plants by herbivorous insects. Once the insect reaches the plant, contact cues determine host acceptance. Although the willow sawfly Nematus oligospilus (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) can differentiate among willow genotypes, no knowledge is available on the cues used by this insect to seek and accept the host plant. In this study, we recorded behavioral orientation in a Y-tube olfactometer of willow sawfly females to volatiles of the highly preferred genotype Salix nigra and the non-preferred genotype S. viminalis. The volatiles released by undamaged willows of each genotype were analyzed by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Contact cues were evaluated first by oviposition preference bioassays after selective leaf wax removal, and then by studying the micromorphology of abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces and their chemical composition. Willow sawfly females oriented preferentially to S. nigra volatiles, which contained more than 3 times the amount of volatiles than that collected from S. viminalis. Analysis of volatiles showed significant differences in amounts of (Z) and (E)-β-ocimene, undecane, decanal, and β-caryophyllene. The adaxial leaf surface of S. nigra was less preferred after wax removal, suggesting a role of cuticular waxes for oviposition acceptance. No differences were found among the micromorphology of leaf surfaces between preferred and non-preferred genotypes. The chemical analysis of cuticular waxes showed that the abaxial leaf surface of S. viminalis, which is completely avoided for oviposition, possessed 97% of alkanes. The accepted leaf surfaces contained a more diverse wax profile including alcohols, acids, and esters. Thus, non-alkane wax compounds might be related to oviposition. In sum, our study suggests that several cues act in concert to provide oviposition cues for the sawfly N. oligospilus: females are attracted to volatiles from a distance, and once alighting on the plant, they seek specific chemical contact cues in order to lay eggs.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000818', 'D003463', 'D005260', 'D020387', 'D060434', 'D006927', 'D007814', 'D055696', 'D010058', 'D018515', 'D032108', 'D013045', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Cues', 'Female', 'Food Chain', 'Herbivory', 'Hymenoptera', 'Larva', 'Olfactory Perception', 'Oviposition', 'Plant Leaves', 'Salix', 'Species Specificity', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Both Volatiles and Cuticular Plant Compounds Determine Oviposition of the Willow Sawfly Nematus oligospilus on Leaves of Salix spp. (Salicaceae).,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000254', 'Q000254', None, None, 'Q000033', 'Q000033', None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'growth & development', 'growth & development', None, None, 'anatomy & histology', 'anatomy & histology', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26449817,2016

26365752,"Dehydro pyrrolizidine alkaloids (dehydro PAs) are carcinogenic phytotoxins prevalent in the Boraginaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae families. Dehydro PAs enter the food and feed chain by co-harvesting of crops intended for human and animal consumption as well as by carry-over into animal-based products such as milk, eggs and honey. Recently the occurrence of dehydro PAs in teas and herbal teas has gained increasing attention from the EU, due to the high levels of dehydro PAs found in commercially available teas and herbal teas in Germany and Switzerland. Furthermore, several tropane alkaloids (TAs, e.g. scopolamine and hyoscyamine) intoxications due to the consumption of contaminated herbal teas were reported in the literature. The aim of the present study was to determine the dehydro PAs and TAs levels in 70 pre-packed teabags of herbal and non-herbal tea types sold in supermarkets in Israel. Chamomile, peppermint and rooibos teas contained high dehydro PAs levels in almost all samples analysed. Lower amounts were detected in black and green teas, while no dehydro PAs were found in fennel and melissa herbal teas. Total dehydro PAs concentrations in chamomile, peppermint and rooibos teas ranged from 20 to 1729 μg/kg. Except for black tea containing only mono-ester retrorsine-type dehydro PAs, all other teas and herbal teas showed mixed patterns of dehydro PA ester types, indicating a contamination by various weed species during harvesting and/or production. The TA levels per teabag were below the recommended acute reference dose; however, the positive findings of TAs in all peppermint tea samples warrant a more extensive survey. The partially high levels of dehydro PAs found in teas and herbal teas present an urgent warning letter to the regulatory authorities to perform routine quality control analysis and implement maximum residual levels for dehydro PAs.","Food additives & contaminants.

In this study, we compared PBDE concentrations and congener patterns in eggs of five seabird species (thick-billed murres, northern fulmars, black guillemots, glaucous gulls, black-legged kittiwakes) breeding at a colony in the Canadian Arctic in 1993, 2008 and 2013. Temporal trends of PBDEs (1975-2014) and another flame retardant, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) (2003-2014), were also examined in eggs of two seabird species, the thick-billed murre and northern fulmar. BDE-47 generally dominated the BDE congener profiles in eggs of all five species. Glaucous gulls had the highest concentrations of both ΣPBDE and BDE-47, and northern fulmars, the lowest. ΣPBDE concentrations increased exponentially in eggs of both thick-billed murres and northern fulmars from 1975 to 2003 with doubling times of 9.1 years in the murres and 7.2 years in the fulmars. From 2003 to 2008/09, ΣPBDE decreased rapidly in the murres and fulmars to concentrations not significantly different from those recorded in 1975 and 1987 for each species. After 2008/09, ΣPBDE concentrations plateaued. BDE-47 followed a similar temporal trend to that of ΣPBDE concentrations. These concentration trends were consistent with the phase-out of the penta- and octa-BDE products from the North American market in the mid-2000s. There was an overall decline in concentrations of HBCD in murre eggs from 2003 to 2014, whereas concentrations in the fulmar eggs increased from 2003 to 2006 followed by a decline to 2014. The ratio of HBCD to BDE-47 suggests that northern fulmars showed more of a European contaminant signature, and thick-billed murres, more of a North American signature.

With the ban of several chemical control measures, new sustainable methods are needed to mitigate Saprolegnia infections in aquaculture. Here, PhyloChip-based community analyses showed that the Pseudomonadales, particularly Pseudomonas species, represent one of the largest bacterial orders associated with salmon eggs from a commercial hatchery. Among the Pseudomonas species isolated from salmon eggs, significantly more biosurfactant producers were retrieved from healthy salmon eggs than from Saprolegnia-infected eggs. Subsequent in vivo activity bioassays showed that Pseudomonas isolate H6 significantly reduced salmon egg mortality caused by Saprolegnia diclina. Live colony mass spectrometry showed that strain H6 produces a viscosin-like lipopeptide surfactant. This biosurfactant inhibited growth of Saprolegnia in vitro, but no significant protection of salmon eggs against Saprolegniosis was observed.

Chicken eggs, as one of the most popular food commodities, in different parts of Tehran (Iran) were analyzed for two groups of hazardous substances including some organochlorine pesticides (OC) such as aldrin, lindane, dieldrin, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, heptachlor and endusulfan) and heavy metals namely mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr). Gas chromatography- electron capture detector, hydride-generation atomic absorption spectrometry, cold- vapor atomic absorption spectrometry and conductively coupled plasma atomic optical spectrometry were used to determine the levels of OCs, As, Hg and the others, respectively. For OCs, the results revealed none of the levels were more than maximum residues levels (MRLs), but three of them (Aldrin, lindane and endusulphan) were detectable. Moreover, 100% of 50 eggs had heavy metals with levels higher than limit of detection of the procedure. The levels of Pb and Hg in all eggs and Cd in 47% of samples were more than MRLs.

26197575,"Due to the harmfulness of melamine to human, the quantitative detection of melamine in egg is very necessary. In the present study, the surface enhanced Raman spectra technology combined with chemometric analysis method was used to conduct melamine quantitative detection in egg white. Firstly, the melamine egg sample could be got by the method of artificial feeding hens usingdifferent feeding formulation. Then the surface enhanced Raman spectra of egg white was determined using portable Raman spectroscopy (Opto Trace RamTracer-200) and Raman enhancement reagents, and the melamine content within the white eggs was measured with gas chromatography mass spectrometry technology. The software of Raman Analyzer was used for baseline correction of Raman spectra. The correlation coefficient method was used to choose 320 spectral variables from the surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy as input variables to establish partial least squares quantitative calibration model . And the peaks-decomposition method was used to establish peaks-decomposition quantitative calibration model. Both models selected 90 and 44 samples respectively as calibration sets and validation sets during model establishment, and both models achieved good prediction effect. The determination coefficient between predicted values of partial least squares quantitative calibration model and measured values of gas chromatography mass spectrometry was 0.856, and root mean square error of prediction was 1.547. The determination coefficient was 0.947 and RMSEP was 0.893 for the peaks-decomposition quantitative calibration model.

Total Hg mass fractions ranged from 0.17 µg/g to 1.23 µg/g wet weight in eggs collected from nests on lakes representing a wide range of pH (5.0-8.1) and were modeled as a function of maternal loon Hg exposure and egg laying order. Blood total Hg mass fractions in a sample of loon chicks ranged from 0.84 µg/g to 3.86 µg/g wet weight at hatch. Factors other than mercury exposure that may have persistent consequences on development of chicks from eggs collected on low-pH lakes (i.e., egg selenium, calcium, and fatty acid mass fractions) do not seem to be contributing to reported differences in loon chick quality as a function of lake pH. However, it was observed that adult male loons holding territories on neutral-pH lakes were larger on average than those occupying territories on low-pH lakes. Differences in adult body size of common loons holding territories on neutral-versus low-pH lakes may have genetic implications for differences in lake-source-related quality (i.e., size) in chicks.

Precipitation of lipids and proteins was promoted by subjecting the extracts at very low temperature (-23°C) for 12h. Further cleanup with hexane ensures fat removal from the matrix. Analysis was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Two separate runs were performed for positive and negative ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). Particular attention was devoted to extraction optimization: different sample-to-extracting volume ratios, different concentrations of formic acid in the extraction solvent and different ultrasonic extraction temperatures were tested in butter, egg and milk powder samples. The method was also applied in fish tissue samples. It was validated, on the basis of international guidelines, for all four matrices.

26051081,"A sample preparation method was developed for the analysis of chicken eggs to determine 97 GC and 81 LC amenable residues, including organophosphates, organochlorines, pyrethroids, triazoles, carboxyl-containing compounds, and the indicator PCBs. Hereby, considerations were given to the recoveries of the analytes, the method's suitability for routine analysis, and the assessment of the clean-up effect, for which a simple thin layer chromatography was implemented to visualize the most important lipid classes. The procedure consisted of (I) the extraction by matrix solid phase dispersion, and the clean-up by means of (II) small-scale gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and (III) two different solid phase extractions (SPE) for GC and LC amenable analytes, as well as (IV) the quantification using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS. Cyclohexane/ethyl acetate was chosen as extraction solvent due to its suitability for extracting strong non-polar but also more polar analytes. The classical GPC was scaled down to ensure a 50% lower solvent consumption. The comprehensive investigation of conventional and modern zirconium-oxide-coated SPE materials resulted in the selection of octadecyl-modified silica (C18) combined with primary secondary amine using acetonitrile as elution solvent for GC amenable analytes and pure C18 in combination with acidified methanol for LC amenable pesticides. Compared to the currently established EN 1528 method the sample preparation proposed offered a higher sample throughput and a lower solvent consumption. Furthermore, for the first time the clean-up effectiveness of the sample preparation steps was documented as shown by means of thin-layer chromatography. The validation of chicken eggs proved the fulfillment of the quality control criteria for 164 of the 178 analytes tested, mostly at the lowest validated level of 5μg/kg for pesticides and 0.5μg/kg for the single indicator PCBs. However, the analysis of strongly polar analytes was still problematic, which could be attributed to the extraction and the GPC step. Nevertheless, the successful investigation of EU proficiency test materials (EUPT AO 07-09) confirmed the comparability of the results with the currently established sample preparation procedures and demonstrated the potential of the applicability of the presented method to other matrices as exemplified for lean poultry meat and fatty liquid cream.

26020245,"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are typically monitored via targeted mass spectrometry, which potentially identifies only a fraction of the contaminants actually present in environmental samples. With new anthropogenic compounds continuously introduced to the environment, novel and proactive approaches that provide a comprehensive alternative to targeted methods are needed in order to more completely characterize the diversity of known and unknown compounds likely to cause adverse effects. Nontargeted mass spectrometry attempts to extensively screen for compounds, providing a feasible approach for identifying contaminants that warrant future monitoring. We employed a nontargeted analytical method using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC/TOF-MS) to characterize halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) in California Black skimmer (Rynchops niger) eggs. Our study identified 111 HOCs; 84 of these compounds were regularly detected via targeted approaches, while 27 were classified as typically unmonitored or unknown. Typically unmonitored compounds of note in bird eggs included tris(4-chlorophenyl)methane (TCPM), tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH), triclosan, permethrin, heptachloro-1'-methyl-1,2'-bipyrrole (MBP), as well as four halogenated unknown compounds that could not be identified through database searching or the literature. The presence of these compounds in Black skimmer eggs suggests they are persistent, bioaccumulative, potentially biomagnifying, and maternally transferring.

An ultrasonication and vacuum assisted extraction (UVAE), followed by a multi-stage clean-up procedure, enabled the removal of up to 1g of lipid from 2.5 g of freeze-dried food samples and significantly reduce matrix effects. UVAE achieves a waste factor (WF) of about 10%, while the WFs of classical QuEChERS methods range usually between 50 and 90%. The low WF of UVAE leads to a dramatic improvement in the sensitivity along with saving up to 90% of spiking (internal) standards. Moreover, a two-stage clean-up on Florisil and aminopropyl silica was introduced after UVAE, for an efficient removal of pigments and residual lipids, which led to cleaner extracts than normally achieved by dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE). In this way, the extracts could be concentrated to low volumes, e.g. <100 μL and the equivalent matrix concentrations were up to 100g ww/mL. The final analysis of PFRs was performed on GC-EI-MS, while PBDEs and EFRs were measured by GC-ECNI-MS. Validation tests were performed with three food matrices (lean beef, whole chicken egg and salmon filet), obtaining acceptable recoveries (66-135%) with good repeatability (RSD 1-24%, mean 7%).

The extracted samples were eluted via solid-phase extraction using 2% formic acid in acetonitrile/methanol (1:1, v/v). The two polypeptides were identified and quantified based on the intensities of mass fragments from the respective triply charged precursor ions (bacitracin: 474.97 amu and polymyxin B: 402 amu) at the defined retention time windows using liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in time-scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode. The calibration curves showed good linearity over the concentration range 50-2500 ng/mL with determination coefficients ≥ 0.991. The mean recoveries were in the range 80.3-88.8% with relative standard deviations <13% for all samples. The limits of quantitation ranged from 30-250 ng/g.

Further evaluations performed with GC-HRMS (gas chromatography in combination with high resolution mass spectrometry) revealed elevated amounts of non-dioxin-like (non-dl) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) dominated by most lipophilic congeners like PCB 138, 153 and 180 and of dioxin-like (dl) PCBs, with a congener pattern in the descending order of PCB 118, 156, 167, 105, 189, 157, 105, 126 and PCB 77. Contaminations with polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) appeared of minor priority, with only hepta- and octa-substituted dioxins above their limits of quantification (LOQs). The pattern of polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) was dominated by low amounts of tetra- and penta-chlorinated congeners. To identify the source of contamination, several samples of organic-farmed eggs, soil, laying hens, feedstuff, corrugated asbestos-cement cover plates (ACPs), stable dust and debris collected in the gutter of the stable, were analyzed. Comparing PCB congener-pattern of individual samples, the source was traced back to the coating of ACPs, which covered roof and sidewalls of the stable.

25814275,"To help safeguard the food supply and detect the presence of undeclared food allergens and gluten, most producers and regulatory agencies rely on commercial test kits. Most of these are ELISAs with a few being PCR-based. These methods are very sensitive and analyte specific, requiring different assays to detect each of the different food allergens. Mass spectrometry offers an alternative approach whereby multiple allergens may be detected simultaneously. However, mass spectrometry requires expensive equipment, highly trained analysts, and several years before a quantitative approach can be achieved. Using multianalyte profiling (xMAP®) technology, a commercial multiplex test kit based on the use of established antibodies was developed for the simultaneous detection of up to 14 different food allergens plus gluten. The assay simultaneously detects crustacean seafood, egg, gluten, milk, peanut, soy, and nine tree nuts (almond, Brazil nut, cashew, coconut, hazelnut, macadamia, pine nut, pistachio, and walnut). By simultaneously performing multiple tests (typically two) for each analyte, this magnetic bead-based assay offers built-in confirmatory analyses without the need for additional resources. Twenty-five of the assays were performed on buffer extracted samples, while five were conducted on samples extracted using reduced-denatured conditions. Thus, complete analysis for all 14 allergens and gluten requires only two wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. This makes it possible to include in a single analytical run up to 48 samples. All 30 bead sets in this multiplex assay detected 5 ng/mL of food allergen and gluten with responses greater than background. In addition, 26 of the bead sets displayed signal/noise ratios of five or greater. The bead-based design makes this 30-plex assay expandable to incorporate new antibodies and capture/detector methodologies by ascribing these new detectors to any of the unassigned bead sets that are commercially available.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000485', 'D028527', 'D004797', 'D005504', 'D005512', 'D005983', 'D007118', 'D059346']","['Allergens', 'Cuminum', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Glutens', 'Immunoassay', 'Magnets']",Multiplex detection of food allergens and gluten.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25814275,2016

For quantification of Cr(VI), the method was based on an alkaline extraction (NH4OH solution at pH 11.5) followed by Cr(VI) determination by anion-exchange HPLC-ICP-MS. Analytical performances of the method were satisfactory in terms of linearity, specificity, accuracy, repeatability, and intermediate precision. Detection limits ranged from 1 to 10 μg/kg, depending on the matrices investigated. The method was then applied for the determination of Cr(VI) in several products (dairy products, flour, chocolate, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, eggs, and beverages) from different brands and origins. Cr(VI) was found in none of the samples investigated. To further investigate the reason for this absence, a stability study of spiked Cr(VI) was therefore conducted.

25750054,"Geophagia is defined as deliberate consumption of earths' materials, e.g. soil, clay and soft stones. The practice is widespread among pregnant women, and there are conflicting views as to whether it is beneficial to health or not. Geophagic materials may be a source of micronutrients though the materials may bind the micronutrients thus reducing or hindering their bioavailability in the body. Geophagia is closely associated with geohelminthic infections among pregnant women and heavy metal poisoning, which constitute significant public health problem in many developing countries such as Kenya. In our research, the geophagic materials consumed by the pregnant women were studied. A total of 38 geophagic materials in the possession by different pregnant women were analysed. The collected samples were subjected to standard digestion procedures and analysed for zinc, lead and iron by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Results indicated that the geophagic materials contained elevated levels of Fe at mean concentration value of 80.10 ppm, Pb at 3.28 ppm and Zn 1.81 ppm for a 1.00 g sample. An average of 20 g of the geophagic materials was being consumed per day. Based on the average consumption, the pregnant women were exposed to 65.52 ppm Pb per day, 36.2 ppm Zn per day and 1602 ppm Fe per day. Lead exceeded the WHO-lead exposure limits of 25 ppm/day for pregnant women. The materials were also subjected to microscopic examination for Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Taenia Spp., Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. In conclusion, the women were exposed to heavy metals-iron, zinc and lead, but there was no observable eggs, larvae or adult species of the geohelminths. The key recommendation was that there is need to integrate public health education on geophagia, lead screening and testing with antenatal support care systems. This will enhance maternal and child health, thus reducing infant and maternal morbidity and mortality rates.

This method is based on the hydrolysis of covalently bound metabolites and derivatization with 2-nitrobenzaldehyde. Clean-up is achieved by a liquid/liquid and a reversed phase/solid phase extraction. Not only are the four conventional nitrofurans (nitrofurantoin, furazolidone, nitrofurazone and furaltadone) detected, but also nifursol, nitrovin and nifuroxazide. Furthermore, an underivatizable nitrofuran (nifurpirinol) and another banned drug (chloramphenicol) can be quantified as well. The compounds are detected in the form of their precursor ions, [M+H](+) and [M-H](-), respectively. The mass resolving power of 70,000 FWHM, and the applied mass window ensure sufficient selectivity and sensitivity. Confirmation is obtained by monitoring the HRMS resolved product ions which were derived from the unit-mass resolved precursor ions. The multiplexing capability of the utilized Orbitrap instrument provides not only highly selective, but also sensitive confirmatory signals.

The objective of the present study was to assess spatial variation of contaminant levels (organochlorines [OCs], brominated flame retardants [BFRs], perfluorinated alkyl substances [PFASs], and mercury [Hg]) in ivory gulls breeding in different areas across the Arctic region as a baseline for potential future changes associated with climate change. Contaminants were already determined in eggs from Canada (Seymour Island; except PFASs), Svalbard in Norway (Svenskøya), and 3 sites in Russia (Nagurskoe, Cape Klyuv, and Domashny). New data from Greenland allowed the investigation of a possible longitudinal gradient of contamination. The most quantitatively abundant OCs were p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorobiphenyls. Mercury concentrations were higher in Canada compared with other colonies. Eggs from Nagurskoe often were characterized by higher OC and BFR concentrations. Concentrations gradually decreased in colonies situated east of Nagurskoe.

Extracts from developmental stages of S. haematobium, including eggs, induce tumor-like phenotypes in cultured cells. In addition, estrogen-derived, reactive metabolites occur in this pathogen and in sera of infected persons. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed on urine from 40 Angolans diagnosed with urogenital schistosomiasis (UGS), half of who also presented UGS-associated squamous cell carcinoma and/or urothelial cell carcinoma. The analysis revealed numerous estrogen-like metabolites, including seven specifically identified in UGS cases, but not reported in the database of metabolites in urine of healthy humans. These schistosome infection-associated metabolites included catechol estrogen quinones (CEQ) and CEQ-DNA-adducts, two of which had been identified previously in S. haematobium. In addition, novel metabolites derived directly from 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) were identified in urine of all 40 cases of UGS.

Three of these pathogens, the liver flukes Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini and the blood fluke Schistosoma haematobium, are of particular concern due to their classification as Group 1 carcinogens: infection with these worms is carcinogenic. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approaches, we identified steroid hormone like (e.g., oxysterol-like, catechol estrogen quinone-like, etc.) metabolites and related DNA-adducts, apparently of parasite origin, in developmental stages including eggs of S. haematobium, in urine of people with urogenital schistosomiasis, and in the adult stage of O. viverrini. Since these kinds of sterol derivatives are metabolized to active quinones that can modify DNA, which in other contexts can lead to breast and other cancers, helminth parasite associated sterols might induce tumor-like phenotypes in the target cells susceptible to helminth parasite associated cancers, i.e., urothelial cells of the bladder in the case of urogenital schistosomiasis and the bile duct epithelia or cholangiocytes, in the case of O. viverrini and C. sinensis. Indeed we postulate that helminth induced cancers originate from parasite estrogen-host epithelial/urothelial cell chromosomal DNA adducts, and here we review recent findings that support this conjecture.

Previous data provided evidence that eggs from hens exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light contain large quantities of vitamin D. In the current study, we assessed the efficacy of vitamin D enrichment in eggs upon increasing daily UVB exposure times. We further addressed the question whether extended UVB irradiation affects the skin content of 7-dehydrocholesterol. To this end, 35 hens were assigned to 7 groups of 5 animals each and were exposed to UVB light (76μW/cm(2)) for 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 300min per day, respectively. Eggs from the treatment groups were collected at baseline and after 2, 3 and 4 weeks of treatment, respectively. Skin samples were gained at the end of 4 weeks. Vitamin D metabolites were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The contents of vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 in egg yolk raised non-linear in response to increasing daily UVB exposure times. The vitamin D3 content did not reach a clear-cut plateau within the chosen UVB treatment times. A daily UVB exposure time of 300min resulted in vitamin D3 contents of 28.6μg/100g egg yolk dry matter. In contrast to vitamin D3, the 25(OH)D3 content in the egg yolk achieved a maximum upon an UVB irradiation time of 60min/d. The cutaneous 7-dehydrocholesterol contents were not altered in response to the chosen UVB irradiation times. In conclusion, the data show a distinct non-linear dose-response relationship of UVB exposure times on the total vitamin D content in eggs.

This epidemic is a serious threat to viticulture that has been increasing for more than 60 years in Europe. We studied the effect of synchrony with the plant phenology and the effect of plant-sap quality on the individual fitness. Thus, we conducted laboratory experiments to determine if insect hatchings were synchronized with grapevine bud break. We used two natural populations: one from a cold winter vineyard and one from a mild winter vineyard. In both cases, egg hatching was synchronized with bud break and leaf appearance. The phloem quality of the young and old leaves as a food source was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the effects on S. titanus growth were evaluated. Phloem composition varied with the grapevine cutting's age but also varied between leaves of different ages from the same plant. The older leaves were less nutritious because they had the highest carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and the lowest content of essential amino acids. Despite diverse phloem qualities, no fitness difference was observed. We found that the synchronization of egg hatchings with bud break is well regulated. However, the nymphs are not affected by the phloem-sap quality, suggesting that S. titanus may accept different food qualities and that egg hatching synchrony could contribute to population expansion in vineyards.

The results showed that the concentrations of PBDEs in the muscle of river fish samples near the e-waste recycling site were significantly higher than those in the market farmed fish without obviously polluted sources of PBDEs. The distribution of PBDEs in various tissues was not even, and the highest and lowest mean concentrations of total PBDEs ( sigma PBDEs) were 18.82 ng x g(-1) and 1.97 ng x g(-1) (wet weight), in heart and egg tissues, respectively.

25305412,"An explanation for the origin and the high concentration of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) in some species of fish is still not apparent. Because fish may live in deep water and may, thus, not be exposed to solar ultraviolet (UV) light, it is commonly assumed that vitamin D found in their livers and adipose tissue has been derived from a food chain, originating in zooplankton exposed to UV light at the water surface. To investigate the metabolism and possible origin of vitamin D in fish, rainbow trout were reared from eggs, in the absence of light, and were fed a vitamin D-free diet. When small quantities of radioactively-labelled vitamin D were injected or fed to these trout, much of the radioactivity was found as excreted metabolites in bile. Hence, even when they are vitamin D deficient, trout vigorously catabolise and excrete exogenous vitamin D. The main vitamin D metabolite found in plasma of non-deficient trout was 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3]. This was produced in the liver by an enzyme process that was strongly stimulated in vitamin D deficiency. When vitamin D was fed for several weeks to vitamin D-deficient trout, plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels rose to 180 pg/ml and the fish became hypercacemic. When vitamin D-deficient fish were inadvertently exposed to 60 W incandescent light for 24h, they became moribund and died. It was subsequently found that vitamin D-deficient trout can produce vitamin D in skin when exposed to blue light at wavelengths between 380 and 480 nm. It is concluded that trout, like terrestrial vertebrates, produce 1,25(OH)2D3 as the functional form of vitamin D and that this has an effect on calcium homeostasis. Furthermore, vitamin D is formed in the skin of these fish by the photochemical action of visible light on 7-dehydrocholesterol.

This protein meal elicits an increase in midgut proteolytic activity that is under neuropeptidergic regulation. Time series of decapitation and rescue experiments of liver fed flies evidenced the need of a peptide factor released by corpora cardiaca (CC) within 4h post protein feeding in order to assure complete protein digestion. Q-Exactive quantitative differential peptidomics analysis on CC of sugar fed flies and flies 5h post protein feeding respectively, showed a unique consistent decrease in the stored amount of adipokinetic hormone (AKH) ranging between 16% up to 63%. Injection of AKH into liver fed decapitated flies as well as sugar fed intact flies resulted in dose dependent enhanced midgut proteolytic activity up to the level of intact protein fed flies.

25180796,"The evolution of brood parasitism has long attracted considerable attention among behavioural ecologists, especially in the common cuckoo system. Common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) are obligatory brood parasites, laying eggs in nests of passerines and specializing on specific host species. Specialized races of cuckoos are genetically distinct. Often in a given area, cuckoos encounter multiple hosts showing substantial variation in egg morphology. Exploiting different hosts should lead to egg-phenotype specialization in cuckoos to match egg phenotypes of the hosts. Here we test this assumption using a wild population of two sympatrically occurring host species: the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) and reed warbler (A. scirpaceus). Using colour spectrophotometry, egg shell dynamometry and egg size measurements, we studied egg morphologies of cuckoos parasitizing these two hosts. In spite of observing clear differences between host egg phenotypes, we found no clear differences in cuckoo egg morphologies. Interestingly, although chromatically cuckoo eggs were more similar to reed warbler eggs, after taking into account achromatic differences, cuckoo eggs seemed to be equally similar to both host species. We hypothesize that such pattern may represent an initial stage of an averaging strategy of cuckoos, that--instead of specializing for specific hosts or exploiting only one host--adapt to multiple hosts.",PloS one,"['D000818', 'D001696', 'D001717', 'D004528', 'D009425', 'D010063', 'D010641', 'D010858', 'D020308', 'D013045', 'D061350']","['Animals', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Birds', 'Egg Shell', 'Nesting Behavior', 'Ovum', 'Phenotype', 'Pigmentation', 'Songbirds', 'Species Specificity', 'Sympatry']",Continuous variation rather than specialization in the egg phenotypes of cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) parasitizing two sympatric reed warbler species.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25180796,2015

In the 60th week of hen's life, 10 eggs from each group were collected. In the 70th week of hen's life, all hens were slaughtered and samples of blood and bile were collected. The samples were analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for DON and de-epoxy-DON. DON was only detected in samples of hens which fed the FUS diet while none of the samples analysed had detectable levels of de-epoxy-DON. In plasma and bile samples, DON levels ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 ng ml(-1) and from 1.8 to 4.1 ng ml(-1), respectively. DON levels in egg yolk and albumen ranged between 0.0-0.46 ng g(-1) and 0.0-0.35 ng g(-1), respectively, corresponding to carry-over rates of DON into eggs from 0.0 to 0.000016.

The method used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in electrospray ionization mode (ESI). The procedure involved extraction with acetonitrile and removal of phospholipids by zinc chloride (ZnCl₂) followed by SPE cleanup with a Plexa cartridge. The effect of ZnCl₂ on phospholipid removal was directly observed using the post column infusion procedure. The SPE washing and elution conditions were optimized using a shallow gradient procedure. The free and conjugated steroids forms were determined using enzyme hydrolysis. The developed method resulted in satisfactory precision (RSD≤15%), and the limits of quantification were between 0.05 and 25 ng/g depending on the steroid types. The recoveries ranged from 63.2% to 121.5%. Finally, the developed method was successfully applied to compare the steroids in eggs from different species (i.e., hen, duck, quail and pigeon eggs) or different raising system (i.e., normal vs. organic eggs). The steroids can be clearly clustered according to species and raising system. The hierarchical clustering analysis indicated similarity of the steroids among the species.

A total of 134 dust samples and 129 food samples were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The mean concentration of ΣPBDE in in-house dust (38,685ng/g dw) was higher than that in out-house dust (24,595ng/g). For food samples, the highest concentration of ΣPBDE was found in fish and shellfish (2755ng/kg ww), followed in descending order by eggs (2423ng/kg), cereals (2239ng/kg) and meat (1799ng/kg). The estimated total daily dietary intake of PBDEs was 1671ng/day for adults and 952ng/day for children. The present study indicated that dust intake was the dominant PBDE exposure route for children, and the dietary intake was the dominant PBDE exposure route for adults. Our findings revealed high PBDE concentrations in dust and food samples collected at the center of e-waste recycling area, raising significant health concerns for residents in this particular region, especially for children.

24853518,"Bacillus cereus group bacteria are opportunistically pathogenic spore-forming microorganisms well known in the sector of pasteurized food products because of their involvement in spoilage events. In the sector of egg product processing, these bacteria may lead to important economic losses. It seemed then relevant to study their behavior in egg white, a widely used egg product usually recognized as developing different levels of antimicrobial activities depending on the environmental conditions. A strong bactericidal effect (decrease in the bacterial population of 6.1 ± 0.2 log CFU/ml) was observed for 68 B. cereus group isolates, independently incubated at 30°C in egg white at pH 9.3 (natural egg white pH). To determine which components could explain such a strong bactericidal effect, an experimental strategy was carried out, based on egg white fractionation by ultrafiltration and by anion-exchange liquid chromatography. The role of the protein fraction was thus demonstrated, and subsequent nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses allowed identification of ovotransferrin as a major protein involved. The strong bactericidal effect was confirmed in the presence of commercial ovotransferrin. Such a bactericidal effect (i.e., a decrease in the bacterial population through cell death) had never been described because ovotransferrin is known for its bacteriostatic effect (i.e., inhibition of growth) due to its ability to chelate iron. Surprisingly, the addition of iron did not reverse the bactericidal effect of ovotransferrin under alkaline conditions (pH 9.3), whereas it completely reversed this effect at pH 7.3. Ovotransferrin was shown to provoke a perturbation of the electrochemical potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. A membrane disturbance mechanism could, hence, be involved, leading to the lysis of B. cereus group bacteria incubated in egg white.",Journal of food protection,"['D000818', 'D000900', 'D001409', 'D002645', 'D003207', 'D004529', 'D004531', 'D006863']","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacillus cereus', 'Chickens', 'Conalbumin', 'Egg White', 'Eggs', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration']",Ovotransferrin plays a major role in the strong bactericidal effect of egg white against the Bacillus cereus group.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000382', None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'microbiology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853518,2014

24424343,"Insect parasitoids normally produce white colored eggs. Habrobracon gelechiae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a gregarious ectoparasitoid of various caterpillars. We found that adult female H. gelechiae lays yellow colored eggs when its larvae developed from host larvae of Choristoneura rosaceana and Epiphyas postvittana (both Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) that were fed green plant leaves, but white colored eggs when these same host larvae species were fed non-plant diets. This study investigated the causes of egg color in H. gelechiae and the possible consequences in terms of parasitoid fitness resulting from differential egg color. Using high-performance liquid chromatography we demonstrated that the yellow coloration resulted from the uptake of carotenoid plant pigments (mainly lutein and β-carotene) that were initially ingested by the caterpillar larvae from plant leaves, later absorbed by the parasitoid larvae (F0) feeding on the host and carried over to the adult parasitoids, and finally translocated to the eggs (F1) of the parasitoids. The amount of plant pigments consumed by the parasitoid larvae (F0) affected the intensity of the yellow color of the parasitoid's eggs (F1). Similarly, egg color was affected by the adult female parasitoids lifetime egg production and deposition rate. Further tests suggest that the observed differences in egg color did not have a genetic basis and did not affect egg viability or fitness. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of a tri-trophic and multi-stage translocation of carotenoid plant pigments in parasitoids. We discuss possible evolutionary significance and putative functions of the absorption of plant pigments by parasitoid species.

We have developed an efficient method to extract OCX-36 from chicken eggshell membranes for purification with cation and anion exchange chromatographies.

24280057,"The crustacean male-specific androgenic hormone is widely accepted as a key factor in sexual differentiation and in the development of secondary sex characteristics. However, the mechanism by which the plethora of different reproductive strategies are controlled and executed in crustaceans is not known. We discovered in the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, a hitherto unknown neurohormone, named crustacean female sex hormone (CFSH), in distinct neurosecretory cells in the eyestalk ganglia. CFSH is highly expressed in females but weakly in males, and its crucial role in developing adult female phenotypes has now been established. CFSH cDNA encodes a 225-amino acid (aa) novel protein composed of a 23-aa predicted signal peptide, 33-aa precursor-related peptide and 167-aa mature protein that did not match any other sequence in GenBank. CFSH RNA interference knockdown by multiple administrations of double-stranded RNA at the prepubertal stage causes abnormal development of brooding and mating systems upon puberty. These systems include a pair of gonopores and an egg attachment system for brooding, comprised of an enlarged semicircular abdomen and ovigerous setae. The ovigerous setae in CFSH knocked-down females were fewer and 50% shorter and the gonopores were either significantly smaller than those of controls, misplaced, or absent. We also identified CFSH in the green crab, Carcinus maenas, a species that shares a similar reproductive strategy with C. sapidus. Together, our data provide the first evidence for the presence of a female hormone in crustaceans and its importance in positively controlling anatomic features associated with brooding and mating systems. From an evolutionary standpoint, the endocrine control supporting a female-specific reproductive strategy, as previously described for many vertebrate species, has now been demonstrated for the first time in crustaceans.

24196216,"In this work, the hypothesis of a possible dietary effect on the isotopic composition of Zn in blood from populations with different feeding habits, i.e. lacto-ovo vegetarians and omnivores, was investigated through isotopic analysis of Zn in common food products by multi-collector ICP - mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Several certified reference materials (CRMs) were also included in the sample set for comparison purposes. For these CRMs, the isotopic composition of Zn is expressed as δ-values, calculated with respect to both IRMM-3702 and JMC-ZnLyon, as isotopic standards. The range of δ(66)Zn values observed in food products was approximately 1.9‰. In general, vegetables, cereals and derived products showed an enrichment of the heavier Zn isotopes, whereas a depletion was observed in products of animal origin (meat, fish, egg and semi-skimmed milk), relative to human blood samples. Mussel, however, showed a significant enrichment of the heavier isotopes, which is hypothetically attributed to its accumulation behaviour. Thus, the lower δ(66)Zn values found in food products of animal origin appear to be reflected in the lower δ(66)Zn value observed in blood from an omnivorous population compared to that for a vegetarian population.

Acute toxicity analysis was conducted using five heavy metals (cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, and mercury), and the toxicity endpoint was established from the egg hatching rate during a 14-day exposure period. Median hatching toxicity (HC₅₀) values were determined for each heavy metal, and the most toxic heavy metal was found to be mercury (0.11 mg/L), followed by copper (0.32 mg/L) and lead (4.39 mg/L). E. orientalis eggs were highly tolerant to cadmium and chromium (>120 mg/L). Proteinchip array analysis using a strong anion exchange proteinchip (Q10) in conjunction with SELDI-TOF-MS was used to assess the protein expression patterns after exposure to heavy metals at the EHC10 (prohibiting hatching concentration to 10% eggs), except for cadmium and chromium, which were used at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100mg/L. Three novel biomarker candidate proteins, i.e., 4269, 4283, and 4623 m/z, were identified for the detection of heavy metal toxicity in aquatic ecosystems at the level of HC₁₀ in E. orientalis eggs.

This study shows that the cuticle has a compositional gradation with an outer part richer in proteins and an inner part richer in sulfated polysaccharides and phosphates. It also shown that the cuticle composition, thickness, and degree of coverage are highly dependent on hen age and egg freshness. During the course of the first laying year, the thickness and degree of glycosylation of the cuticle decreases with hen age, and at the end of the laying cycle, the cuticle is significantly depleted in lipids. There are also well-defined compositional changes in the cuticle of freshly laid eggs as time passes and there is a notable increase in the permeability of the eggshell after 24 h due to cuticle drying.

A new, rapid sample preparation approach based on the QuEChERS extraction procedure was applied. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) employing electrospray ionisation (ESI) in negative mode was used for the quantification of target analytes. Method quantification limits (MQLs) were in the range of 1-10 ng kg(-1) (ng l(-1)) for fish, meat, hen eggs, cheese and milk, and in the range of 2.5-125 ng kg(-1) for butter. Only 16 of the group of 21 PFASs were found in at least one analysed sample. From 16 PFASs, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most frequently detected analyte present in approximately 50% of samples (in the range of 0.98-2600 ng kg(-1)). PFCAs with C8-C14 carbon chain were presented in approximately 20% of samples. The concentration ranges of individual compounds in the respective groups of PFASs were: 2.33-76.3 ng kg(-1) for PFSAs (without PFOS), 4.99-961 ng kg(-1) for PFCAs, 10.6-95.4 ng kg(-1) for PFPAs, and 1.61-519 ng kg(-1) for FOSA. The contamination level in the analysed food commodities decreased in the following order: seafood > pig/bovine liver >> freshwater/marine fish > hen egg > meat >> butter.

A toxicosis in 6,000 laying hens caused by the malicious addition of unknown amounts of coumatetralyl bait as well as the insecticides aldicarb, methomyl, and imidacloprid in the drinking water, was investigated in the current study. In order to determine a possible carryover of coumatetralyl into eggs, a rapid and reliable analytical method was developed and fully validated for the simultaneous detection of 6 anticoagulant rodenticides (warfarin, coumatetralyl, coumachlor, bromadiolone, difenacoum, and brodifacoum) in yolk and albumen using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. The method developed was reproducible, sensitive, accurate, and linear within the range of 0.01-1 mg/kg, which is the concentration range of bromadiolone and warfarin found in yolk in previously reported studies. The coefficient of variations of within and between days was 1.0-8.5% for yolk and 0.6-3.8% for albumen, while recoveries from spiked albumen and yolk samples were all in the range of 79-99% and 51-95%, respectively. Limits of detection in yolk were 0.01 mg/kg for warfarin and 0.003 mg/kg for the remaining compounds; in albumen, the limit of detection was 0.003 mg/kg for warfarin, coumatetralyl, and coumachlor, and 0.0015 mg/kg for difenacoum and brodifacoum. The application of the validated method revealed the presence of coumatetralyl in the yolk only at levels of 0.0057 mg/kg and 0.0052 mg/kg on the second and fourth day of the poisoning.

23994561,"Protein phosphorylation is an important regulatory post-translational modification in many biochemical processes. The phosphopeptide analysis strategies developed in this study were all at microscale. After using a standard microwave oven to assist protein digestion, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were tagged with chemical analogues, such as 2-mercaptoethanol and 3-mercapto-1-propanol, to enable simultaneously relative quantitation and identification. This method enabled the use of thio alcohols for direct labeling of phosphorylated sites (not labeled at the mercapto, amino, hydroxyl, or carboxyl groups) of phosphopeptides. Various digestion parameters (e.g., microwave power, reaction time, NH4HCO3 concentration) and derivatization efficiency parameters (e.g., reaction time, labeling tag concentration) were studied and optimized. In both control and experimental samples, microwave-assisted digestion coupled with relative quantitation using analogue tags enabled calculation of phosphopeptide ratios in the same sequence. A non-labeling method was also established for quantifying phosphopeptides in human plasma by using the abundant protein albumin as an internal control for normalizing relative quantities of phosphopeptides.

23983078,"The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a biological control tactic that is used as a component of area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programs. The SIT can only be applied against disease-transmitting mosquitoes when only sterile male mosquitoes are released, and the blood-sucking and potentially disease-transmitting females are eliminated from the production line. For Anopheles arabiensis, a potent vector of malaria, a genetic sexing strain was developed whereby females can be eliminated by treating the eggs or larvae with the insecticide dieldrin. To evaluate the presence of dieldrin residues in male mosquitoes designated for SIT releases, a simple, sensitive, and accurate gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) method was developed. In addition, bioaccumulation and food chain transfer of these residues to fish after feeding with treated mosquitoes was demonstrated. The overall recovery from method validation studies was 77.3 ± 2.2% (mean ± relative standard deviation [RSD]) for the mosquitoes, and 99.1 ± 4.4% (mean ± RSD) for the fish. The average dieldrin concentration found in adult male An. arabiensis was 28.1 ± 2.9 µg/kg (mean ± standard deviation [SD]). A range of 23.9 ± 1.1 µg/kg to 73.9 ± 5.2 µg/kg (mean ± SD) of dieldrin was found in the fish samples.

23933450,"The transfer of dioxins from contaminated soil into the food chain has recently become an up-and-coming topic in the environmental policy and health-related consumer protection. Within the framework of the 2011 National Food Survey that monitored the levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in foods of animal origin, the sum of the WHO-PCDD/F/PCB-TEQ concentrations exceeding two-fold the European Union's maximum level was detected in eggs from a free-range farm (12.55 ± 2.37 pg WHOPCDD/F/PCB-TEQ/g fat). Investigations have revealed that the source of egg contamination was the backyard soil on which the hens were foraging. A follow-up study of laying hens from this farm has demonstrated the transfer of dioxins into all tested tissues (breast and leg muscles, abdominal fat), liver and ovarian follicles. The bioaccumulation of dioxins was found to be congener and tissue-dependent. The highest concentration was found in the liver, followed by the ovarian follicles, and the adipose tissue. The PCDD/F levels in the liver often were approximately two times higher from those in other materials from the same hen. The potential dioxin intakes with eggs were expressed as the percent of the Tolerable Weekly Intake (TWI), and the Provisional Tolerable Monthly Intake (PTMI). The weekly intake of dioxins would be 3.5 pg WHO-TEQ/kg b.w. (24.9% TWI) for an adult and 20.3 pg WHO-TEQ/kg b.w. (145.2% TWI) for a 3-year old child. Considering a monthly consumption of such contaminated eggs, intake of dioxins would be slightly lower, but still over 100% of the PTMI for a child.

The aims of the present study were to quantify the levels of urinary Sia N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and ketodeoxynonulosonic acid (KDN) and to determine their relationship with dietary Sia intake. Spot urine samples were collected from 386 healthy children aged 3 (n 108), 4 (n 144) and 5 (n 134) years at 06.30-07.00, 11.30-12.00 and 16.30-17.00 hours. Food intake levels were recorded on the day of urine sample collection. Sia levels were quantified using LC-MS/MS with [13C3]Sia as an internal standard. We found that (1) total urinary Sia levels in healthy pre-school children ranged from 40 to 79 mmol Sia/mol creatinine; (2) urinary Sia levels were independent of age and consisted of conjugated Neu5Ac (approximately 70·8 %), free Neu5Ac (approximately 21·3 %), conjugated KDN (approximately 4·2 %) and free KDN (approximately 3·7 %); Neu5Gc was detected in the urine of only one 4-year-old girl; (3) total urinary Sia levels were highest in the morning and declined over time in 4- and 5-year-old children (P< 0·05), but not in 3-year-old children; (4) Sia intake levels at breakfast and lunch were approximately 2·5 and 0·16 mg Sia/kg body weight; and (5) there was no significant correlation between dietary Sia intake levels and urinary Sia levels. Urinary Sia levels varied with age and time of day, but did not correlate with Sia intake in 3- to 5-year-old children.

23762268,"The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) is the primary vector of the bacterium causing citrus huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious disease of citrus worldwide. Psyllids and other hemipterans produce large amounts of honeydew, which has been used previously as an indicator of phloem sap composition and insect feeding or metabolism. Behavioral, ultrastructural and chemical studies on ACP, its honeydew and waxy secretions showed important differences between nymphs, males and females, and suggested some mechanisms by which the psyllids, especially nymphs and adult females, can minimize their contamination with honeydew excretions. The anal opening in ACP, near the posterior end of the abdomen, is on the ventral side in nymphs and on the dorsal side in adult males and females. Video recordings showed that adult males produce clear sticky droplets of honeydew gently deposited behind their body on the leaf surface, whereas adult females produce whitish honeydew pellets powerfully propelled away from the female body, probably to get their excretions away from eggs and newly hatched nymphs. ACP nymphs produce long ribbons or tubes of honeydew that frequently stay attached to the exuviae after molting, or drop when feeding on the lower side of citrus leaves. Furthermore, honeydew excretions of both nymphs and adult females are covered with a thin layer of whitish waxy material ultrastructurally composed of a convoluted network of long fine filaments or ribbons. This material is extruded from intricate arrays of wax pores in the circumanal ring (around the anus) that is found in nymphs and females but not in males of ACP or other psyllid species.

Trafficking of illegally obtained wild white sturgeon eggs is a major concern to the California Department of Fish and Game, but there is no forensic method to separate wild and farm-raised white sturgeon eggs. The extension of these findings in future work will be to use the fatty acid and mineral compositions as forensic indicators of caviar produced legally from farm raised sturgeon compared with illegal caviar produced from sturgeon poached from the wild. Samples (10) of sturgeon eggs were collected from a commercial aquaculture facility in the Sacramento Valley. Eggs from wild sturgeon (9) were obtained primarily from confiscations of illegally caught sturgeon by fish and game law enforcement personnel.

This study investigated the egg white as a source of bioactive compounds. Egg white was fractionated using tandem ion exchange chromatography (SAX and SCX), and seven fractions were assessed for any associated bioactivity. Four fractions at various protein concentrations were shown to contain proliferative bioactivity that exceeded the FBS control. The most potent fraction (6) was used in an in vitro wound closure assay to demonstrate a positive influence on cell migration and restored scratch wounds more rapidly than the control.

In this study, through negative/positive ion switching mode, simultaneous determination of four typical acid orange dyes and three typical basic orange dyes was achieved by a single high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, and the analytical efficiency of multiresidues identification was greatly improved. To enhance detection sensitivity, the sample pretreatment conditions and HPLC-MS/MS determining conditions were carefully optimized. Under optimal conditions, good linearity was obtained over the range of 5-500 μg L(-1) with a correlation coefficient (R(2)) >0.9998. Limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) of the seven dyes were 0.5-3.0 and 2.0-6.0 μg kg(-1), respectively. The recoveries of the seven dyes in soybean products and marinated eggs were 74-126% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.22-25.4%, suggesting the developed method is promising for the accurate quantification of the seven dyes at trace levels in foods.

A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (RP-HPLC-FLD) method was developed to determine AMO residues in albumen, yolk and whole egg. By using pre-column derivatisation, an improved liquid-liquid extraction procedure was developed for sample preparation. AMO were extracted from eggs with acetonitrile. The extract solution was extracted using saturated methylene chloride. The supernatant was reacted with salicylaldehyde under acidic and heating conditions. Limits of detection (LODs) were 1.2 ng g⁻¹ and limits of quantification (LOQs) were 3.9 ng g⁻¹ for AMO. Recoveries of AMO from samples fortified at levels of 5.0-125.0 ng g⁻¹ ranged from 79.1% to 88.5% in albumen, 78.6-83.6% in yolk and 78.3-85.1% in whole egg, with coefficients of variation of ≤7.3%. The maximum concentrations of AMO in albumen, yolk and whole egg were found to occur at 1.5, 2.5, 1.5 days after withdrawal of medication respectively. AMO was not detectable in albumen at 7.5 days after final administration of AMO, at 10.5-11.5 days in yolk and 10.5 days in whole egg after administration of two oral doses.

The egg samples of chicken and duck were collected from the 59 stalls of 14 main eggs wholesale markets in Beijing, respectively. Systematic analyses were made for seventeen kinds of perfluorochemicals (11 perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), 3 perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), 2-perfluorooctylethanoic acid (FOEA) and 2H-perfluoro-2-decenoic acid (FOUEA) by a high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The results showed that there was a certain perfluorochemical contamination in all egg samples. Nine kinds of perfluorochemicals were detected in chicken eggs, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) and perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) are dominant, and their average concentrations were 0.105, 0.073 and 0.069 ng x g(-1), respectively. Ten kinds of perfluorochemicals were detected in the duck eggs, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and PFOA are dominant, and their average concentrations were 0.378 and 0.296 ng x g(-1), respectively.

23482720,"Microorganisms produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which mediate interactions with other organisms and may be the basis for the development of new methods to control plant-parasitic nematodes that damage coffee plants. In the present work, 35 fungal isolates were isolated from coffee plant rhizosphere, Meloidogyne exigua eggs and egg masses. Most of the fungal isolates belonged to the genus Fusarium and presented in vitro antagonism classified as mutual exclusion and parasitism against the nematode-predator fungus Arthrobotrys conoides (isolated from coffee roots). These results and the stronger activity of VOCs against this fungus by 12 endophytic bacteria may account for the failure of A. conoides to reduce plant-parasitic nematodes in coffee fields. VOCs from 13 fungal isolates caused more than 40% immobility to Meloidogyne incognita second stage juveniles (J2), and those of three isolates (two Fusarium oxysporum isolates and an F. solani isolate) also led to 88-96% J2 mortality. M. incognita J2 infectivity decreased as a function of increased exposure time to F. oxysporum isolate 21 VOCs. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis lead to the detection of 38 VOCs produced by F. oxysporum is. 21 culture.

23473245,"A sample extraction and purification procedure that uses ammonium-salt-induced acetonitrile/water phase separation was developed and demonstrated to be compatible with the recently reported method for pesticide residue analysis based on fast extraction and dilution flow injection mass spectrometry (FED-FI-MS). The ammonium salts evaluated were chloride, acetate, formate, carbonate, and sulfate. A mixture of NaCl and MgSO4, salts used in the well-known QuEChERS method, was also tested for comparison. With thermal decomposition/evaporation temperature of <350°C, ammonium salts resulted in negligible ion source residual under typical electrospray conditions, leading to consistent method performance and less instrument cleaning. Although all ammonium salts tested induced acetonitrile/water phase separation, NH4Cl yielded the best performance, thus it was the preferred salting out agent. The NH4Cl salting out method was successfully coupled with FI/MS/MS and tested for fourteen pesticide active ingredients: chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, chlorimuron ethyl, oxamyl, methomyl, sulfometuron methyl, chlorsulfuron, triflusulfuron methyl, azimsulfuron, flupyrsulfuron methyl, aminocyclopyrachlor, aminocyclopyrachlor methyl, diuron and hexazinone. A validation study was conducted with nine complex matrices: sorghum, rice, grapefruit, canola, milk, eggs, beef, urine and blood plasma. The method is applicable to all analytes, except aminocyclopyrachlor. The method was deemed appropriate for quantitative analysis in 114 out of 126 analyte/matrix cases tested (applicability rate=0.90). The NH4Cl salting out extraction/cleanup allowed expansion of FI/MS/MS for analysis in food of plant and animal origin, and body fluids with increased ruggedness and sensitivity, while maintaining high-throughput (run time=30s/sample).

23418580,"The structure, functioning and dynamics of polar marine ecosystems are strongly influenced by the extent of sea ice. Ice algae and pelagic phytoplankton represent the primary sources of nutrition for higher trophic-level organisms in seasonally ice-covered areas, but their relative contributions to polar marine consumers remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the potential of diatom-specific lipid markers and highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs) for estimating the importance of these two carbon pools in an Antarctic pelagic ecosystem. Using GC-MS analysis, we studied HBI biomarkers in key marine species over three years in Adélie Land, Antarctica: euphausiids (ice krill Euphausia crystallorophias and Antarctic krill E. superba), fish (bald notothens Pagothenia borchgrevinki and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum) and seabirds (Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, snow petrels Pagodroma nivea and cape petrels Daption capense). This study provides the first evidence of the incorporation of HBI lipids in Antarctic pelagic consumers. Specifically, a di-unsaturated HBI (diene) of sea ice origin was more abundant in ice-associated species than in pelagic species, whereas a tri-unsaturated HBI (triene) of phytoplanktonic origin was more abundant in pelagic species than in ice-associated species.

The parameters tested were: whole egg vs. egg yolk, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) enrichment, spray-drying temperature (160°C vs. 180°C), production scale (industrial vs. pilot plant), storage temperature (15°C vs. 30°C) and time (1, 2, 4 and 8 months). The quality of egg powders was evaluated by sensory analysis using free sorting, and by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and olfactometry. PUFA enrichment and spray-drying temperature do not affect the odour of egg yolk powders. There are significant differences between the odour of whole-egg and egg-yolk powders as well as between powders produced on an industrial scale or in a pilot plant.

23332305,"Benzimidazoles (BZDs) are anthelmintic agents widely used in veterinary medicine. Their use in food-producing animals increases the possibility of residues appearing in animal tissues and products. Most analytical procedures reported for the determination of BZDs have been developed based on liquid chromatography (LC) because of their polar nature - zwitterionic - and thermal lability. To our knowledge, the determination of these compounds by capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) has not yet been described. In this work CE-MS is proposed for the identification and simultaneous quantification of several benzimidazoles in egg samples. The target compounds were 2-aminobenzimidazole, carbendazim, albendazole-2-aminosulphone, 5-hydroxy-thiabendazole, oxibendazole, albendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole, albendazole-sulphone, fenbendazole-sulphone. Optimization of the composition and nature - organic/aqueous - of both the electrophoretic separation buffer and the injection medium was carried out with a view to obtaining the best sensitivity and separation efficiency for the CE-MS coupling. A comparative study was carried out on different sample treatments for analyte extraction from egg samples. Two of them comprised a solvent extraction step followed by clean-up using a new commercial polymeric sorbent (Evolute ABN(©)), and the third was a particularization of the general extractive method so called Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS). Different modifications of the QuEChERS method were assayed, which included a later preconcentration step based on either SPE with MCX(©) sorbents or evaporation. The whole optimized method (QuEChERS with preconcentration prior to CE-MS) was validated according to the 2002/657/EC decision obtaining a CE-MS method sufficiently reliable and robust to determine residues of these compounds in egg samples of different origins with limits of detection between 3 and 51 μgL(-1) (S/N=3) and recoveries in the 74-112% range.",Journal of chromatography.

Therefore, if individuals with food allergy consume drugs containing allergenic food-derived excipients, eliminating the risk of developing specific allergic symptoms induced by them may not be possible. We determined the levels of proteins in pharmaceutical excipients and ethical drugs (inhalants and injections) by spectrophotometric analyses.

This work developed a simplified extraction scheme in which both free choline and related compounds along with phospholipids were extracted into a homogenized phase using chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8) and diluted into methanol for the analysis of target compounds in a variety of sample matrices. The analyte recoveries were evaluated by spiking tissues and food samples with two isotope-labeled internal standards, PC-d(3) and Cho-d(3). Recoveries of between 90% and 115% were obtained by spiking a range of sample matrices with authentic standards containing all 14 of the target analytes. The precision of the analysis ranged from 1.6% to 13%. Accuracy and precision was comparable to that obtained by quantification of selected phospholipid classes using (31)P NMR.

23125343,"A relationship has been suggested between eggshell colour and female body condition based on the opposing antioxidant properties of the two main eggshell pigments: the antioxidant biliverdin (blue-green) and the pro-oxidant protoporphyrin (brown). We hypothesized that experimentally food-restricted females with low antioxidant capacity would deposit more protoporphyrin and less biliverdin in their eggshells, resulting in eggshells of reduced brightness but increased colour intensity. Two eggs were collected at the beginning and two at the end of a 2 week period from each of 24 female Japanese quails that were either food restricted or receiving ad libitum food (i.e. controls) during that time. Reflectance spectra were recorded and analysed using spectral shape descriptors, chromatic and achromatic contrasts were computed accounting for avian visual sensitivities, and eggshell pigments were quantified. We examined both spot and background pigmentation and found no significant effect of food restriction on eggshell reflectance. However, food-restricted females in lower body condition increased the deposition of protoporphyrin and decreased the amount of biliverdin invested in their eggshells. We hypothesize that in species laying brown-spotted eggshells, females modulate eggshell pigment investment in response to their body condition. According to this hypothesis, we predict that females maintain eggshell colour to limit visible changes that could be detected by predators and thereby conceal their eggs, although this work has yet to be conducted.

The diets were offered in six replicate boxes (five hens each) for 13 days. Eggs were collected from each group for melamine quantification on days 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 13. At the end of the experimental period, one hen per box was randomly selected and slaughtered to collect plasma, liver, kidney and muscle samples. During the experiment, feeding diets with increasing levels of melamine had no effect (P > 0.05) on weight gain, feed intake, egg production, egg weight and mortality of laying hens. The melamine in eggs increased from day 1 after melamine ingestion and reached a plateau between days 6 and 13 of melamine ingestion. At steady-state condition, the melamine egg concentrations increased (P < 0.01) with treatments, being 0.026, 0.352 and 4.631 mg/kg for T1, T2 and T3, respectively. Similarly, the carryover of melamine from feed to egg increased (P < 0.05) with the levels of melamine in the diets, varying from 0.50 to 0.70 and 0.84 for T1, T2 and T3, respectively. The melamine was detected in plasma of all tested groups, increasing (P < 0.01) with levels of melamine in the diets (0.030, 0.266 and 4.102 mg/l in T1, T2 and T3, respectively). Melamine was not detected in kidney, liver and muscle of hens fed T1. Except for kidney sampled in the T3, no melamine concentration higher than 2.5 mg/kg, representing the maximum allowable limit set by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Union for food and feeds, was measured. The melamine resulted higher in plasma and kidneys than in the liver and muscle both in T2 and T3. The results confirmed the presence of an excretion pattern of melamine from feed to eggs and tissues in laying hens.",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D002851', 'D004531', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D016014', 'D013058', 'D014227', 'D014781']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Eggs', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Linear Models', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Triazines', 'Viscera']","Melamine in eggs, plasma and tissues of hens fed contaminated diets.","[None, 'Q000097', 'Q000662', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000662', 'Q000032', 'Q000378']","[None, 'blood', 'veterinary', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'veterinary', 'analysis', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23031478,2013
23020697,"Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) in addition to milk, eggs, fish, crustaceans, wheat, tree nuts, and soybean are commonly referred to as the ""big eight"" foods that contribute to the majority of food allergies worldwide. Despite the severity of allergic reactions and growing prevalence in children and adults, there is no cure for peanut allergy, leaving avoidance as the primary mode of treatment. To improve analytical methods for peanut allergen detection, researchers must overcome obstacles involved in handling complex food matrices while attempting to decipher the chemistry that underlies allergen protein interactions. To address such challenges, we conducted a global proteome characterization of raw peanuts using a sophisticated GELFrEE-PAGE-LC-MS/MS platform consisting of gel-based protein fractionation followed by mass spectrometric identification. The in-solution mass-selective protein fractionation: (1) enhances the number of unique peptide identifications, (2) provides a visual map of protein isoforms, and (3) aids in the identification of disulfide-linked protein complexes. GELFrEE-PAGE-LC-MS/MS not only overcomes many of the challenges involved in the study of plant proteomics, but enriches the understanding of peanut protein chemistry, which is typically unattainable in a traditional bottom-up proteomic analysis. A global understanding of protein chemistry in Arachis hypogaea ultimately will aid the development of improved methods for allergen detection in food.",Journal of proteome research,"['D000485', 'D000595', 'D010367', 'D015153', 'D002850', 'D004591', 'D008969', 'D010940', 'D017386', 'D053719']","['Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arachis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Size-selective fractionation and visual mapping of allergen protein chemistry in Arachis hypogaea.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23020697,2013

23000641,"In bivalves, serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, 5-HT) acts as a major promotional factor in oocyte maturation, sperm motility, and sequential spawning. The previously reported novel neuronal protein, oocyte maturation arresting factor (OMAF) that was found in the central nervous system and hemolymph of the Japanese scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis, has an inhibitory activity in the 5-HT-induced oocyte maturation via a receptor-mediated mechanism, resulting in an arrest of spawning [30]. In this study, OMAF protein was isolated from the supernatant of hemolymph of the scallop using gel and anion-exchange chromatography, and SDS-PAGE. Three digested partial peptides with 4, 11, and 16 amino acid residues were determined through reversed-phase HPLC and amino acid sequencing. The anti-OMAF antibodies generated against the obtained peptides with 11 and 16 amino acid residues were applied to immunohistochemistry and 5-HT-induced spawning and oocyte maturation assays. Fusiform OMAF neurons were localized in the external area of the anterior lobe of the cerebral ganglion, supporting our presumption that OMAF was secreted from the cerebral and pedal ganglia (CPG). Pretreatment with anti-OMAF antibody on three kinds of bivalve species showed a strong in vivo amplification of 5-HT-induced release of egg and sperm, and an in vitro restoration of 5-HT-induced germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) from inhibition by the CPG extract, suggesting the release from suppressive activity of OMAF due to the absorption with antibody.

22969785,"Soybean (Glycinemax) is a hugely valuable soft commodity that generates tens of billions of dollars annually. This value is due in part to the balanced composition of the seed which is roughly 1:2:2 oil, starch, and protein by weight. In turn, the seeds have many uses with various derivatives appearing broadly in processed food products. As is true with many edible seeds, soybeans contain proteins that are anti-nutritional factors and allergens. Soybean, along with milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and wheat, elicit a majority of food allergy reactions in the United States. Soybean seed composition can be affected by breeding, and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture, insect/pathogen load, and/or soil nutrient levels). The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of genotype and environment on allergen and anti-nutritional proteins in soybean. To address genetic and environmental effects, four varieties of non-GM soybeans were grown in six geographically distinct regions of North America (Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Ontario, and Pennsylvania). Absolute quantification of proteins by mass spectrometry can be achieved with a technique called multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), during which signals from an endogenous protein are compared to those from a synthetic heavy-labeled internal standard. Using MRM, eight allergens were absolutely quantified for each variety in each environment. Statistical analyses show that for most allergens, the effects of environment far outweigh the differences between varieties brought about by breeding.",Frontiers in plant science,[],[],Environmental effects on allergen levels in commercially grown non-genetically modified soybeans: assessing variation across north america.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22969785,2012

However, the specificity and role of plant volatiles induced during the early phase of attack, i.e. egg deposition by herbivorous insects, and their consequences on insects of different trophic levels remain poorly explored. In olfactometer and wind tunnel set-ups, we investigated behavioural responses of a specialist cabbage butterfly (Pieris brassicae) and two of its parasitic wasps (Trichogramma brassicae and Cotesia glomerata) to volatiles of a wild crucifer (Brassica nigra) induced by oviposition of the specialist butterfly and an additional generalist moth (Mamestra brassicae). Gravid butterflies were repelled by volatiles from plants induced by cabbage white butterfly eggs, probably as a means of avoiding competition, whereas both parasitic wasp species were attracted. In contrast, volatiles from plants induced by eggs of the generalist moth did neither repel nor attract any of the tested community members. Analysis of the plant's volatile metabolomic profile by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the structure of the plant-egg interface by scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the plant responds differently to egg deposition by the two lepidopteran species.

22851358,"Commission Decision (CD) 2002/657/EC describes detailed rules for method validation within the framework of residue monitoring programmes. The approach described in this CD is based on criteria. For (qualitative) screening methods, the most important criteria is that the CCβ has to be below any regulatory limit. Especially when microbiological or immunochemical methods are involved, the approach described in the CD is not easily applied. For example, by those methods, a large number of analytes (all antibiotics) within several different matrices (meat, milk, fish, eggs, etc.) are detected. It is not completely clear whether all those analytes and all matrices have to be taken into account during method validation. To clarify this, a working group - from EU Reference Laboratories - came up with a practical approach to validate multi-analyte multi-matrix screening methods. It describes how many analyte/matrix combinations have to be tested and how these combinations are selected. Furthermore it describes how to determine CCβ for screening methods in relation to a large list of compounds and maximum residue limits (MRLs). First for each analyte/matrix combination the 'cut-off' level - i.e. the level at which the method separates blanks from contaminated samples - is established. The validation is preferably at the concentration of 50% of the regulatory limit. A minimum set of 20 different samples has to be tested. From the experiences with applying these guidelines it was concluded that the validation approach is very 'practical'; however, there are some remarks.

22807528,"The authors undertook 2 crossover-designed studies to characterize plasma amino acid (AA) responses to the intake of 20 g of protein. In Study 1, 15 untrained and overnight-fasted subjects consumed 20 g protein from skim milk, soy milk, beefsteak, boiled egg, and a liquid meal supplement. In Study 2, 10 fasted endurance-trained subjects consumed 20 g protein from a protein-rich sports bar at rest and after a 60-min submaximal ride. Plasma AA concentrations were measured immediately before and for 180 min after food ingestion using a gas-chromatography flame-ionization detection technique. A pharmacokinetic analysis was undertaken for profiles of total AAs (TAA), essential AAs, branched-chain AAs (BCAA), and leucine. Although area-under-the-curve values for plasma TAA were similar across protein sources, the pattern of aminoacidemia showed robust differences between foods, with liquid forms of protein achieving peak concentrations twice as quickly after ingestion as solid protein-rich foods (e.g., ~50 min vs ~100 min) and skim milk achieving a significantly faster peak leucine concentration than all other foods (~25 min). Completing exercise before ingesting protein sources did not cause statistically significant changes in the pattern of delivery of key AAs, BCAAs, and leucine apart from a 20-40% increase in the rate of elimination.

22797850,"The larva of codling moth Cydia pomonella (Tortricidae, Lepidoptera) is known as the worm in the apple, mining the fruit for food. We here show that codling moth larvae are closely associated with yeasts of the genus Metschnikowia. Yeast is an essential part of the larval diet and further promotes larval survival by reducing the incidence of fungal infestations in the apple. Larval feeding, on the other hand, enables yeast proliferation on unripe fruit. Chemical, physiological and behavioral analyses demonstrate that codling moth senses and responds to yeast aroma. Female moths are attracted to fermenting yeast and lay more eggs on yeast-inoculated than on yeast-free apples. An olfactory response to yeast volatiles strongly suggests a contributing role of yeast in host finding, in addition to plant volatiles. Codling moth is a widely studied insect of worldwide economic importance, and it is noteworthy that its association with yeasts has gone unnoticed. Tripartite relationships between moths, plants, and microorganisms may, accordingly, be more widespread than previously thought. It, therefore, is important to study the impact of microorganisms on host plant ecology and their contribution to the signals that mediate host plant finding and recognition.

Lam. cultivar Yulmi) and a purple-fleshed sweetpotato cultivar (Shinjami). More than 370 protein spots were reproducibly detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in which 35 spots were up-regulated (Yulmi vs. Shinjami) or uniquely expressed (only Yulmi or Shinjami) in either of the two cultivars. Of these 35 protein spots, 23 were expressed in Yulmi and 12 were expressed in Shinjami. These protein spots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Fifteen proteins in Yulmi and eight proteins in Shinjami were identified from the up-regulated (Yulmi vs. Shinjami) or uniquely expressed (only Yulmi or Shinjami) proteins, respectively. In Yulmi, α-amylase and isomerase precursor-like protein were uniquely expressed or up-regulated and activities of α-amylase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, and dehydroascorbate reductase were higher than in Shinjami. In Shinjami, peroxidase precursor and aldo-keto reductase were uniquely expressed or up-regulated and peroxidase and aldo-keto reductase activities were higher than in Yulmi.

However, the potential risk of template leakage used in molecularly imprinted polymer is a major disadvantage. To solve this problem, 2-(4,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-ylamino) ethanethiol disulfide, a molecule that shares the similar imprinting sites with cyromazine and melamine, was selected as pseudo template to prepare molecularly imprinted polymer. Methacrylic acid, ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate and toluene were selected as functional monomer, crosslinker and porogen, respectively. The molecular recognition property and binding capability of cyromazine and melamine were evaluated by adsorption test and Scatchard analysis. The results showed that the molecularly imprinted polymer based on pseudo template had more excellent affinity and selectivity for cyromazine and melamine. The resulting molecularly imprinted polymer was used as a solid-phase extraction material to enrich cyromazine and melamine in egg and milk samples for high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The solid-phase extraction process was carefully optimized.

Lead pellets were force fed to the digestive tract (struma, ingluvies) and the ingestion was controlled. Concentration of lead was detected using the atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Analysis of the lead concentration in liver showed a significantly higher concentration in all group after the lead pellets intake. The increase of the lead concentration was dose-dependent and the concentration detected in group BAD was similar as in group B2. Very similar tendencies were detected for the lead concentration in kidney. The accumulation of lead in pectoral muscle was lower, in comparison with liver and kidney. Compared to lead concentration detected in ovary of the control group a significant increase was detected in all experimental groups, reaching the maximum in the group B6. Similar significant increase of lead concentration was detected in eggs. The average weight of eggs was 32.01 ± 2.71 g in the control group and lower in all experimental groups, but this decrease was significant only in the group B6.

Cluster analysis on the basis of MALDI mass spectra indicated that the primary determinant for the mass spectra was the species, followed by the developmental stages, which formed distinct clusters within the given species.

This has led to the development of models relating tissue δ²H and δ¹⁸O values to those of water, with potential application in a number of fields. However, the strength and ubiquity of the influence of environmental water on protein isotope ratios across taxonomic groups, and thus the relevance of predictive models, is an open question. Here we report strong co-variation of δ²H and δ¹⁸O values across a suite of terrestrial and aquatic animal meats purchased in American food markets, including beef, poultry (chicken and turkey), chicken eggs, pork, lamb, freshwater fish, and marine fish. Significant isotope co-variation was not found for small collections of marine bivalves and crustaceans. These results imply that isotopic signals from environmental water were propagated similarly through most of the diverse natural and human-managed foodwebs represented by our samples. Freshwater fish had the largest variation in δ²H and δ¹⁸O values, with ranges of 121‰ and 19.2‰, respectively, reflecting the large isotopic variation in environmental freshwaters.

22380936,"In the poultry industry, the widespread use of veterinary drugs such as antimicrobial compounds may lead to the presence of residues in whole eggs, egg white and egg yolk. During this study, laying hens received experimental feed containing sulfadiazine or doxycycline at cross-contamination levels of 2.5%, 5% and 10% of the therapeutic concentration. Since the therapeutic dose is 250 mg kg(-1) for both substances, cross-contamination concentrations in the feed of 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg kg(-1) were expected. Whole egg, egg white and egg yolk samples were collected during the treatment and depletion period and were analysed via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For both drugs, a plateau phase was reached within 3-5 days and residue concentrations were detected in all egg matrices. For the 10% cross-contamination group, residual sulfadiazine concentrations of 208, 299 and 60 µg kg(-1) and residual doxycycline concentrations of 455, 332, 206 µg kg(-1) were detected in whole egg, egg white and egg yolk on day 13 of the treatment period, respectively. Both sulfadiazine and doxycycline had higher concentrations in egg white than in egg yolk, but the egg white-egg yolk ratio was higher for sulfadiazine than for doxycycline. As neither drug is allowed in Belgium for use in laying hens, residues may pose food safety concerns.","Food additives & contaminants.

22337795,"A fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method is developed to determine lincomycin (LM) in honey, muscle, milk, and egg. Samples are cleaned-up at pH 4.7 using Strata-X-C mixed-mode polymeric strong cation exchange solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, which could selectively adsorb the lincomycin from matrices under the acidic condition. LM is separated on the recently introduced Kinetex XB core-shell type HPLC column using isocratic elution mode with a mobile phase containing 0.1% formic acid in water/acetonitrile (93/7, v/v, pH 2.6) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. The subsequent MS/MS detection has decreased ion effect, which allows the limit of detection (LOD) of LM for honey to be 0.05 µg/kg for honey and 0.5 µg/kg for muscle, milk, and egg. These LODs are much lower than those reported previously. The other main advantage of the developed method is the analysis time of only 3.5 min, which is about three times shorter than other reported LC-MS-MS methods. Recoveries varies between 94.2% and 125.2% and in-house reproducibility ranges from 3.7% to 28.7%.

The present work reports the obtainment of the alkaloidic extract of the S. lycocarpum fruit by acid-base extraction and the isolation of the major alkaloid heterosides by chromatographic means, as well as the evaluation of their in vitro schistosomicidal activities. The in vitro schistosomicidal activities of the alkaloidic extract of S. lycocarpum fruits and its isolated steroidal alkaloids were undertaken against adult worms of Schistosoma mansoni. The alkaloidic extract (20, 32, and 50 μg mL(-1)), solasonine (50 μM), solamargine (32 and 50 μM), and equimolar mixture of glycoalkaloids (20, 32, and 50 μM) lead to the separation of all couple worms and extensive disruption on their teguments, such as sloughing, as well as their deaths within 24 h of incubation. In addition, the alkaloidic extract (10 and 15 μg mL(-1)), solasonine (50 μM), solamargine (10, 15, and 20 μM), and equimolar mixtures of glycoalkaloids (10 and 15 μM) reduced the development of eggs produced by the adult worms. Solamargine, containing the sugar chain moiety chacotriose, was more active than the solasonine, which contains solatriose sugar chain moiety. A synergistic effect was also observed for a mixture of solamargine and solasonine.

Daily intake of Se, estimated to be 93 μg Se/person/day, was slightly greater than that calculated from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food balance sheet for KSA, which was approximately 90 μg Se/person/day. The daily intake of Se by Saudis in Riyadh was greater than that of Australians or Dutch but less that of Canadians and Americans. There was a statistically significant correlation (R = +0.38, P < 0.05) between daily intake of Se and concentrations of Se in blood serum of Saudis in Riyadh. The mean concentration of Se in serum was 1.0 × 10(2) ± 30.5 μg Se/l.

22247688,"Dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) are hazardous toxic, ubiquitous and persistent chemical compounds, which can enter the food chain and accumulate up to higher trophic levels. Their determination requires sophisticated methods, expensive facilities and instruments, well-trained personnel and expensive chemical reagents. Ideally, real-time monitoring using rapid detection methods should be applied to detect possible contamination along the food chain in order to prevent human exposure. Sensor technology may be promising in this respect. This review gives the state of the art for detecting possible contamination with dioxins and DL-PCBs along the food chain of animal-source foods. The main detection methods applied (i.e., high resolution gas-chromatography combined with high resolution mass-spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) and the chemical activated luciferase gene expression method (CALUX bioassay)), each have their limitations. Biosensors for detecting dioxins and related compounds, although still under development, show potential to overcome these limitations. Immunosensors and biomimetic-based biosensors potentially offer increased selectivity and sensitivity for dioxin and DL-PCB detection, while whole cell-based biosensors present interpretable biological results. The main shortcoming of current biosensors, however, is their detection level: this may be insufficient as limits for dioxins and DL-PCBs for food and feedstuffs are in pg per gram level. In addition, these contaminants are normally present in fat, a difficult matrix for biosensor detection. Therefore, simple and efficient extraction and clean-up procedures are required which may enable biosensors to detect dioxins and DL-PCBs contamination along the food chain.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000818', 'D015374', 'D004147', 'D004531', 'D020387', 'D008460', 'D008892', 'D011078']","['Animals', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Dioxins', 'Eggs', 'Food Chain', 'Meat', 'Milk', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls']","The need and potential of biosensors to detect dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls along the milk, eggs and meat food chain.","[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22247688,2012
22208159,"Recent studies have suggested that exposure of the freshwater invertebrate Daphnia magna to dietary Zn may selectively affect reproduction without an associated increase of whole body bioaccumulation of Zn. The aim of the current research was therefore to investigate the hypothesis that dietary Zn toxicity is the result of selective accumulation in tissues that are directly involved in reproduction. Since under field conditions simultaneous exposure to both waterborne and dietary Zn is likely to occur, it was also tested if accumulation and toxicity under combined waterborne and dietary Zn exposure is the result of interactive effects. To this purpose, D. magna was exposed during a 16-day reproduction assay to Zn following a 5 × 2 factorial design, comprising five waterborne concentrations (12, 65, 137, 207, and 281 μg Zn/L) and two dietary Zn levels (49.6 and 495.9 μg Zn/g dry wt.). Tissue-specific Zn distribution was quantified by synchrotron radiation based confocal X-ray fluorescence (XRF). It was observed that the occurrence of reproductive inhibition due to increasing waterborne Zn exposure (from 65 μg/L to 281 μg/L) was accompanied by a relative increase of the Zn burdens which was similar in all tissues considered (i.e., the carapax, eggs, thoracic appendages with gills and the cluster comprising gut epithelium, storage cells and ovaries). In contrast, the impairment of reproduction during dietary Zn exposure was accompanied by a clearly discernible Zn accumulation in the eggs only (at 65 μg/L of waterborne Zn). During simultaneous exposure, bioaccumulation and toxicity were the result of interaction, which implies that the tissue-specific bioaccumulation and toxicity following dietary Zn exposure are dependent on the Zn concentration in the water. Our findings emphasize that (i) effects of dietary Zn exposure should preferably not be investigated in isolation from waterborne Zn exposure, and that (ii) XRF enabled us to provide possible links between tissue-specific bioaccumulation and reproductive effects of Zn.",Environmental science & technology,"['D000818', 'D003621', 'D004032', 'D005506', 'D013052', 'D017356', 'D014867', 'D014874', 'D015032']","['Animals', 'Daphnia', 'Diet', 'Food Contamination', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission', 'Synchrotrons', 'Water', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Zinc']",Waterborne versus dietary zinc accumulation and toxicity in Daphnia magna: a synchrotron radiation based X-ray fluorescence imaging approach.,"[None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208159,2012

To monitor the illegal use of these antibiotics in animals, a monoclonal-based indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) has been established. Several haptens were synthesized and conjugated to carrier protein. Female Balb/c mice were inoculated with the four different conjugates to produce monoclonal antibodies according to the schemes of immunization. Aftercell fusion and culture several times, nine hybridoma cell lines were isolated. Only one, 3C4 that has isotype IgG2a, was selected for detailed study. The cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibody 3C4 to tylosin and tilmicosin was 100% and 51% respectively. The standard curves based on the tylosin and tilmicosin matrix calibration ranged from 2.5 to 40 μg L(-1), with an IC(50) value of 6.1 μg L(-1) and 12.1 μg L(-1), respectively. The limits of detection of the ic-ELISA ranged from 5.1 μg kg(-1) to 13.8 μg kg(-1) in edible animal tissues. The recoveries were 74.1% to 120.7% with less than 18.6% of the coefficient of variation when tylosin and tilmicosin were spiked in various biological matrices with the concentrations of 25.0-200.0 μg kg(-1). Good correlations between the results of the ic-ELISA and high performance liquid chromatography were observed in the incurred tissues.

The selection was also tempered by the availability of reliable analytical standards. The analytical methodology designed to allow simultaneous determination of PXDD/Fs and PXBs, was based on internal standardisation with (13)C(12) labelled compounds and high resolution mass spectrometry and involved a new separation procedure using dual activated carbon column fractionation. In order to unambiguously measure these compounds a practical, higher mass resolution (13,500-15,000 res) was used, coupled with a judicious choice of analyte ions and relative ion ratios. Further specificity was incorporated by exploiting the differences in chromatographic retention from those of potential interferants. The methodology was validated and used to measure occurrence levels of these contaminants in different matrices such as milk, meat, fish, eggs, offal, shellfish and soil. The limits of detection achieved by this methodology ranged from 0.005 to 0.02ngkg(-1) fat for foods.

22065561,"Mold metabolites that can elicit deleterious effects on other organisms are classified as mycotoxins. Human exposure to mycotoxins occurs mostly through the intake of contaminated agricultural products or residues due to carry over or metabolite products in foods of animal origin such as milk and eggs, but can also occur by dermal contact and inhalation. Mycotoxins contained in moldy foods, but also in damp interiors, can cause diseases in humans and animals. Nephropathy, various types of cancer, alimentary toxic aleukia, hepatic diseases, various hemorrhagic syndromes, and immune and neurological disorders are the most common diseases that can be related to mycotoxicosis. The absence or presence of mold infestation and its propagation are seldom correlated with mycotoxin presence. Mycotoxins must be determined directly, and suitable analytical methods are necessary. Hundreds of mycotoxins have been recognized, but only for a few of them, and in a restricted number of utilities, a maximum acceptable level has been regulated by law. However, mycotoxins seldom develop alone; more often various types and/or classes form in the same substrate. The co-occurrence might render the individual mycotoxin tolerance dose irrelevant, and therefore the mere presence of multiple mycotoxins should be considered a risk factor. The advantage of chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) is that many compounds can be determined and confirmed in one analysis. This review illustrates the state-of-the-art of mycotoxin MS-based analytical methods for multiclass, multianalyte determination in all the matrices in which they appear. A chapter is devoted to the history of the long-standing coexistence and interaction among humans, domestic animals and mycotoxicosis, and the history of the discovery of mycotoxins. Quality assurance, although this topic relates to analytical chemistry in general, has been also examined for mycotoxin analysis as a preliminary to the systematic literature excursus. Sample handling is a crucial step to devise a multiclass analytical method; so when possible, it has been treated separately for a better comparison before tackling the instrumental part of the whole analytical method. This structure has resulted sometimes in unavoidable redundancies, because it was also important to underline the interconnection. Most reviews do not deal with all the possible mycotoxin sources, including the environmental ones. The focus of this review is the analytical methods based on MS for multimycotoxin class determination. Because the final purpose to devise multimycotoxin analysis should be the assessment of the danger to health of exposition to multitoxicants of natural origin (and possibly also the interaction with anthropogenic contaminants), therefore also the analytical methods for environmental relevant mycotoxins have been thoroughly reviewed. Finally, because the best way to shed light on actual risk assessment could be the individuation of exposure biomarkers, the review covers also the scarce literature on biological fluids.",Mass spectrometry reviews,"['D000818', 'D002853', 'D004781', 'D005516', 'D049690', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D015651', 'D009183', 'D012988', 'D014871']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Food Microbiology', 'History, Ancient', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mycotoxicosis', 'Mycotoxins', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Water Microbiology']","Multiclass mycotoxin analysis in food, environmental and biological matrices with chromatography/mass spectrometry.","[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000266', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'methods', 'history', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22065561,2012

Samples were analyzed from fifteen collection years including 1990 and all years from 1997 to 2010, and from seven colonies located throughout the Great Lakes, ranging from remote to highly urbanized areas. Other than at the Toronto Harbour colony, the slopes of ∑PFSA concentrations (C(6), C(8), and C(10)) versus time were negative indicating general declines between 1990 and 2010. PFOS was the dominant PFSA regardless of colony or year, ranging from 80 to 99% of ∑PFSA. For ∑PFCA (C(8)-C(15)), slopes of concentrations versus time were generally positive with 4 of 7 colonies showing statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in levels through time. Individual PFCAs showed similar increasing trends except for PFOA. Regardless of colony, the PFCA pattern was dominated by the C(10) to C(13) PFCAs. Consistent with the PFOS declines, concentrations of the PFOS precursor, PFOSA, declined at most colonies between 1990 and 2006 and post-2006 concentrations were below detection limits. Declining concentrations of the C(8) PFCs, PFOS, PFOA and PFOSA, were consistent with the phase out in 2002 by the 3M Company in North America of all of C(8) PFC-related chemistry products. Increasing production volumes of fluorotelomer based compounds, and degradation of these compounds to PFCAs may explain increasing trends of PFCAs in gull eggs.

21984012,"In poultry farming, anticoccidial drugs are widely used as feed additives for the prevention and treatment of coccidiosis. Because coccidiostats and veterinary medicines, in general, are often poorly absorbed, manure from treated animals may contain high concentrations of these compounds. Experimental studies have shown that the uptake of veterinary medicines by plants from soil containing contaminated manure may occur. This leads to several questions regarding the impact on the environment, resistance problems, and public health and allergy issues. This work describes the development of a quantification method for coccidiostats in vegetables. Vegetables were spiked at 100 μg kg(-1) (dry weight) with coccidiostats (monensin, narasin, lasalocid A, salinomycin, diclazuril, and nicarbazin) in order to optimize the extraction and clean-up. Possible critical factors (e.g., extraction solvent) were statistically examined by linear regression with the use of Plackett-Burman and full factorial designs. Final extracts were analyzed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry operating in multiple-reaction monitoring mode. Both the synthetic and ionophoric coccidiostats could be determined in a single run with an analysis time of 5 min. The developed method was validated taking into account the requirements of the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC as a guideline. The method is regarded as applicable for its intended purposes with quantification limits between 0.30 and 2.98 μg kg(-1).

In a program aiming at the evaluation of plant as sources of new active molecules, the anthelmintic activities of the essential oils (EOs) obtained from either Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides seeds or Newbouldia laevis leaves were evaluated against Strongyloides ratti by analyzing the results of two in vitro bioassays. These two plants and their tested parts were retained after an ethnopharmacology survey that confirmed their use by small-scale farmers for treatment of small ruminants affected by digestive helminths. The plants were harvested in Benin, and their EO were obtained by hydrodistillation. The EO yield of extraction was 0.65% (w/w) of for Z. zanthoxyloides seeds and 0.05% (w/w) for N. laevis. The chemical compositions of the two EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The major constituents of the EO from Z. zanthoxyloides consisted of the following compounds: γ-terpinene (18 %), undecane (15 %), valencene (8.3 %), decanal (8.3 %), and 3-carene (6.7 %). In contrast, the major constituents of the EO from N. laevis leaves consisted of the following compounds: β-caryophyllene (36 %) and eugenol (5.8 %). An egg-hatching inhibition (EHI) assay was developed and a larval migration inhibition assay was used on S. ratti to examine the effects of the EOs and to evidence their inhibitory concentrations (IC(50) and IC(90)) values on this nematode. Furthermore, the toxicity of the two EOs on Vero cell line was evaluated. When tested on S. ratti egg hatching, the two EOs resulted in similar IC(50) values (19.5 and 18.2 μg/ml for Z. zanthoxyloides and N. laevis, respectively), which were about sevenfold higher than that of the control (thiabendazole, IC(50) = 2.5 μg/ml).

21862099,"Reptiles often breed within agricultural and urban environments that receive frequent pesticide use. Consequently, their eggs and thus developing embryos may be exposed to pesticides. Our objectives were to determine (i) if turtle eggs are capable of absorbing pesticides from treated soil, and (ii) if pesticide absorption rates can be predicted by their chemical and physical properties. Snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) eggs were incubated in soil that was treated with 10 pesticides (atrazine, simazine, metolachlor, azinphos-methyl, dimethoate, chlorpyrifos, carbaryl, endosulfan (I and II), captan, and chlorothalonil). There were two treatments, consisting of pesticides applied at application rate equivalents of 1.92 or 19.2 kg a.i/ha. Eggs were removed after one and eight days of exposure and analyzed for pesticides using gas chromatography coupled with a mass selective detector (GC-MSD) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Absorption of pesticides in eggs from soil increased with both magnitude and duration of exposure. Of the 10 pesticides, atrazine and metolachlor generally had the greatest absorption, while azinphos-methyl had the lowest. Chlorothalonil was below detection limits at both exposure rates. Our preliminary model suggests that pesticides having the highest absorption into eggs tended to have both low sorption to organic carbon or lipids, and high water solubility. For pesticides with high water solubility, high vapor pressure may also increase absorption. As our model is preliminary, confirmatory studies are needed to elucidate pesticide absorption in turtle eggs and the potential risk they may pose to embryonic development.",Chemosphere,"['D000818', 'D004531', 'D007306', 'D012987', 'D012995', 'D014426']","['Animals', 'Eggs', 'Insecticides', 'Soil', 'Solubility', 'Turtles']",Absorption of current use pesticides by snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) eggs in treated soil.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378']","[None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21862099,2012

Targeted analytes were for nine FQs of marbofloxacin (MAR), ofloxacin (OFL), norfloxacin (NOR), ciprofloxacin (CIP), enrofloxacin (ENR), danofloxacin (DAN), orbifloxacin (ORB), difloxacin (DIF) and sarafloxacin (SAR), and three AQs of oxolinic acid (OXA), nalidixic acid (NAL) and flumequine (FMQ). Samples comprised ten different food products covering five matrices: muscle (cattle, swine and chicken), liver (chicken), raw fish (shrimp and salmon), egg (chicken), and processed food (ham, sausage and fish sausage). This method involved a simple extraction with (1:1) acetonitrile-methanol, a highly selective clean-up with an immobilised metal chelate affinity column charged with Fe(3+), a fast isocratic LC analysis using a short column (20 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 µm) with a mobile phase of (15:85:0.1) methanol/water/formic acid, and fluorescence detection (excitation/emission wavelengths of 295 nm/455 nm for FQs (495 nm for MAR), and 320 nm/365 nm for AQs). Among FQs, pairs of NOR/OFL, ORB/DIF and ENR/DAN were incompletely resolved. A confirmatory LC run with a Mg(2+) containing methanolic mobile phase was also proposed for the samples suspected of being positive.

However, little is known about the ability of insect eggs to induce defences directed not against the eggs themselves, but against larvae that subsequently hatch from the eggs. We studied how oviposition (OP) by the sawfly Diprion pini on Pinus sylvestris foliage affects the plant's defensive potential against sawfly larvae. Larvae that initiated their development on P. sylvestris twigs on which they hatched from eggs gained less weight and suffered higher mortality than those fed on egg-free twigs. The poor performance of these larvae also affected the next herbivore generation since fecundity of resulting females was lower than that of females which spent their larval development on egg-free pine. Transcript levels of P. sylvestris sesquiterpene synthases (PsTPS1, PsTPS2) were increased by D. pini OP, reached their highest levels just before larval hatching, and decreased when larvae started to feed. However, concentrations of terpenoid and phenolic metabolites presumed to act as feeding deterrents or toxins for herbivores did not change significantly after OP and feeding.

The vent crab obtained many of its lipids from Bathymodiolus mussels and chemosynthetic microorganisms which live on a mat of long, silky setae on the crab body as exosymbionts. In all lipid classes, the major monounsaturated fatty acids were 16:1n-7 and 18:1n-7, which originate from bacteria. The major polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the triacylglycerols were 16:2n-4, 18:2n-4, 18:2n-7, 18:3n-4,7,10, and 16:2n-3, while those of the crab polar lipids were 16:2n-4, 18:2n-4, 18:3n-4,7,10, 20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid), 20:5n-3 (icosapentaenoic acid), and 22:6n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid) in the phosphatidylethanolamine, and 16:2n-4, 18:2n-4, and 18:3n-4,7,10, with noticeable levels of 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3, and 22:6n-3 in the phosphatidylcholine.

21270306,"Vitellogenin, an egg-yolk protein precursor common to oviparous animals, is found abundantly in honeybee workers - a caste of helpers that do not usually lay eggs. Instead, honeybee vitellogenin (180 kDa) participates in processes other than reproduction: it influences hormone signaling, food-related behavior, immunity, stress resistance and longevity. The molecular basis of these functions is largely unknown. Here, we establish and compare the molecular properties of vitellogenin from honeybee hemolymph (blood) and abdominal fat body, two compartments that are linked to vitellogenin functions. Our results reveal a novel 40 kDa vitellogenin fragment in abdominal fat body tissue, the main site for vitellogenin synthesis and storage. Using MALDI-TOF combined with MS/MS mass-spectroscopy, we assign the 40 kDa fragment to the N terminus of vitellogenin, whereas a previously observed 150 kDa fragment corresponded to the remainder of the protein. We show that both protein units are N glycosylated and phosphorylated. Focusing on the novel 40 kDa fragment, we present a homology model based on the structure of lamprey lipovitellin that includes a conserved β-barrel-like shape, with a lipophilic cavity in the interior and two insect-specific loops that have not been described before. Our data indicate that the honeybee fat body vitellogenin experiences cleavage unlike hemolymph vitellogenin, a pattern that can suggest a tissue-specific role.

The alkaline pH releases the naphthenic acids from the oil sands and dissolves them into water as their soluble naphthenate forms, which are anionic surfactants. These aqueous extracts contain concentrations of naphthenates that are acutely lethal to fishes and other aquatic organisms. Previous research has shown that naphthenic acids can be taken up by fish, but the distribution of these acids in various tissues of the fish has not been determined. In this study, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to commercial (Merichem) naphthenic acids in the laboratory. After a 10-d exposure to approximately 3mg naphthenic acids/L, the fish were dissected and samples of gills, heart, liver, kidney, muscle, and eggs were extracted and analyzed for free (unconjugated) naphthenic acids by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method.

In addition, the blood levels of 29 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzo-furans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl (DL-PCBs) congeners were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The median total toxicity equivalent (TEQ) in the blood, which was calculated on the basis of the toxicity equivalency factors of WHO (2005), was 16 pg TEQg(-1) lipid. Principal component analysis identified five dietary patterns: Healthy diet (high intake of vegetables and fruits); Meat/High fat intake (high intake of meat, meat products, and eggs); Seafood and Alcohol (high intake of fish, shellfish, and alcoholic beverages); Miscellaneous; and Milk products and Alcohol intake (high intake of milk, Milk products, and alcoholic beverages). After adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, and smoking habits, the Seafood and Alcohol pattern scores were significantly related to higher blood levels of total TEQ and PCDDs/PCDFs/DL-PCBs, and the Milk products and Alcohol pattern scores were correlated with higher blood levels of DL-PCBs.

21085936,"Four quinolones (danofloxacin, difloxacin, flumequine and marbofloxacin) were determined in milk and egg samples by a simplified high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure using a micellar mobile phase. No extraction was needed to precipitate the proteins from the matrices since they were solubilised in micelles. The only pretreatment steps required were homogenisation, dilution and filtration before injecting the sample into the chromatographic system. An adequate resolution of the quinolones was achieved by a chemometrics approach where retention was modelled as a first step using the retention factors in only five mobile phases. Afterwards, an optimisation criterion was applied to consider the position and shape of the chromatographic peaks. Analytical separation involved a C18 reversed-phase column, a hybrid micellar mobile phase of 0.05 M sodium dodecyl sulphate, 10% (v/v) butanol and 0.5% (v/v) triethylamine buffered at pH 3 and fluorimetric detection. Quinolones were eluted in less than 15 min without the protein band or other endogenous compounds from the food matrices interfering.

21038852,"As a consequence of the adulteration of infant formulas and milk powders with melamine (MEL) in China in 2008, much attention has been devoted to the analysis of MEL [and cyanuric acid (CA)] in dairy products. Several methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or Raman spectroscopy have been described in the literature. However, no method is available for the simultaneous determination of MEL and CA in other raw materials, which are considered as high-risk materials for economically motivated adulteration. The present paper reports the results of an interlaboratory-based performance evaluation conducted with seven laboratories worldwide. The purpose was to demonstrate the ability of a cleanup-free LC-MS/MS method, originally developed for cow's milk and milk-powdered infant formula, to quantify MEL and CA in egg powder and soy protein. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.02 and 0.05 mg/kg for MEL in egg powder and soy protein, respectively. For CA, LOD and LOQ were 0.05 and 0.10 mg/kg in egg powder and 1.0 and 1.50 mg/kg in soy protein, respectively. Recoveries ranged within a 97-113% range for both MEL and CA in egg powder and soy protein. Reproducibility values (RSD(R)) from seven laboratories were within a 5.4-11.7% range for both analytes in the considered matrices.

Using high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) in the negative mode (LC-APPI(-)-Q-TOF-MS) and the novel use of pure acetone as dopant and LC mobile phase, full scan mass spectra showed that for these BFRs the dominant isotopic ion cluster was [M + O₂](-), and with other lesser abundant [M + O₂ - HBr](-), and [M - H](-) fragment ions. Subsequently, highly sensitive quantification of TBBP-A-dbpe, TBBP-A-ae, and TBBP-S-dbpe was accomplished via LC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with APPI(-) (LC-APPI(-)-MS/MS) via multiple ion monitoring based on the [M + O₂](-) > [Br](-) transition.

This paper reports a simple method for the preparation of immunoglobulin Y (IgY) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) from hen egg yolk.

SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) were used to characterize the two products.

The purities of prepared IgY and HDL were detected by ELISA and a direct high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol assay, respectively. Results show that dilution times 15 makes IgY and HDL separate well from each other. Western blotting proves IgY has an immunocompetence similar to that of human IgG. Histobiochemical staining shows HDL is composed of sugar, lipid, and protein.

20821610,"In 2004 to 2006, in the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia, Canada, we measured pesticides, water chemistry, and hatching success of Great Basin spadefoot (Spea intermontana), Pacific treefrog (Pseudacris regilla), Western toad (Bufo boreas), and Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris). Predator-proof cages containing Gosner Stage 4 eggs were placed in ponds in nonagricultural reference sites in conventionally sprayed and organic orchards. Seventeen pesticides were detected in ponds in sprayed orchards but occurred at low concentrations (ng/L) except for diazinon (1,410 ng/L). Chloride, sulfate, conductivity, nitrate, and phosphorus showed significant differences among sites. Spadefoot mean hatching success ranged from 0 to 92% among sprayed orchards, whereas the range was 48 to 98.6% among organic orchards and 51 to 95.5% among reference sites. Mean hatching success for Pacific treefrog was 22.1 to 76.1% among sprayed orchards, whereas the range was 83.4 to 97.1% among reference sites. Although sample sizes were small and replication was low, we found that trends in hatching success of eggs of Western toad and Columbia spotted frogs were consistent with the other species. Variables that correlated negatively with amphibian hatching success included 12 pesticides and seven water chemistry parameters. However, stepwise regression found that, in 2005, atrazine accounted for 79% of the variation in spadefoot hatching success and, in 2006, atrazine, total nitrate, and chlorpyrifos accounted for 80%. For Pacific treefrog there were no significant correlations with pesticide concentrations; rather, hatching success correlated with water chemistry parameters.

We used an in-house reference material to create multiplication factors to adjust the estimates of OC pesticides and PCBs (Aroclor equivalents) in Great Lake herring gull eggs analyzed using electron capture detection (1987-1997) to be more equivalent to estimates using mass spectrometric detection (1998-2005) as well as accompanying differences in analytical procedures. We examined temporal trends in contaminant concentrations in herring gull eggs using change point regressions, to determine whether significant changes in long-term trends were associated with analytical methodology. The highest frequency of change point occurrences shifted from 1997 (when analytical methodology was altered) to 2003 after data adjustment. The explanatory power (r2) of the regressions was lower after adjustment, although only marginally so (mean r2 difference=0.04). The initial rates of decline before change points in contaminant concentrations were generally slower after the data adjustment, but after any change points the declines were not significantly different.

Changes in analytical approaches (e.g., gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detection [GC-ECD] versus mass spectrometric detection [GC-MSD]) can reveal artifacts in the reported concentrations. In-house reference material (RM) was used to determine the analytical artifacts in the measurement of OCs and PCBs in Great Lake herring gull eggs previously analyzed from 1994 to 1996 (GC-ECD) and 1997 to 1999 (GC-MSD). Approximately 19.0% of the variability of PCB congeners in gull eggs was associated with analytical artifacts, and differences among colonies were obscured. Although the discrepancy in sum PCBs (SigmaPCBs) was fairly small (2.1%), some congeners varied considerably between methods (> 60%). After statistically removing the artifacts, only 1.4% of the variability in PCBs of herring gull eggs was associated with artifacts, and differences among gull colonies became apparent. After excluding OCs near the detection limit in the RM, statistically removing the artifacts reduced some of the differences between methods for OCs. Analytical artifacts may potentially render inferences difficult, confounded, and erroneous.

Following the addition of D(5)-CAP as internal standard, egg, honey, and milk were extracted and cleaned by means of solid-phase extraction, utilizing multi-walled carbon nanotubes as sorbent. The extracts were separated on a Halo fused-core C18 column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.7 μm) and quantified by a 4000 Q-trap mass spectrometer equipped with a TurboIonSpray™ interface using electrospray ionization and multiple-reaction monitoring mode. The method validation was performed according to the criteria of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ) of CAP in milk were calculated for m/z 320.8 > 151.9.

20730647,"The objective of this study was to assess the carry-over of melamine from feed into eggs and body tissues of laying hens. In the first experiment, laying hens were supplied with feed added at 0, 1, 2, 5, 25, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1) of melamine for 21 days followed by a depletion period to observe the residues of melamine in eggs. In a second experiment, laying hens were allocated 0, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1) melamine to determine levels of melamine in body tissues. Melamine and cyanuric acid were simultaneously analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the diet as well as in eggs and body tissue. In the first experiment, melamine appeared in the egg within 24 h after first ingestion of the melamine at 5, 25, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1). Melamine concentration in egg reached a maximum of 2.34 mg kg(-1) within 17 days after exposure of 100 mg kg(-1) melamine, and the carry-over rate for melamine from feed to the eggs was 1.21%. In the second experiment, melamine was detected in tissues within 3 days after exposure; the maximum concentration of melamine residues occurred in the 100 mg kg(-1) group and was as follows: egg (1.83) > kidney (1.21) > breast muscle (0.86) > liver (0.70) > serum (0.42). The melamine level in egg albumen was about twice that of egg yolk. Melamine levels in laying hens decreased rapidly with withdrawal from feed, but melamine only declined to undetectable levels in the egg at day 6 and in tissues at day 4 after last ingestion of 100 mg kg(-1). It can be concluded that a pathway exists for the transmission of melamine from feed to egg and body tissues and the carry-over rate of melamine is low, and that melamine is not metabolized into cyanuric acid in laying hens. A positive relationship exists between exposure levels and eggs or tissues, but no direct relationship between the exposure time and measured levels of melamine in eggs and tissues. The current Chinese limit for melamine in feed and feed material of 2.5 mg kg(-1) established on 8 June 2009 is sufficient to ensure that levels in eggs, breast muscle, liver as well as kidney will not exceed the limit of 2.5 mg kg(-1) in foods other than infant formula introduced by many countries including China.","Food additives & contaminants.

The resulting SiO(2)-SMO-MIP nanoparticles have highly improved imprinting and adsorption capacity, and can be used for separation and determination of sulfonamides in eggs and milk. In the synthesis, monodispersed SiO(2) nanoparticles (Si-NP) of diameter 80 nm were amino-modified by reaction with 3-aminopropyltriethoxylsilane. The acryloyl monolayer was then grafted onto the amine-modified Si-NP. Finally, the MIP films were coated on to the surface of Si-NP by the copolymerization of the vinyl end groups with functional monomer (acrylamide), cross-linking agent (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate), initiator (azo-bis-isobutyronitrile), and template molecule (sulfamethoxazole). The resulting SiO(2)-SMO-MIP-NP were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The adsorption properties were demonstrated by equilibrium rebinding experiments and Scatchard analysis.

The contamination of food products with dioxins and PCBs is a well studied issue, because food is generally considered the major source of dioxin intake for humans. In Italy, the Regional Monitoring Plan (part of the national residue monitoring plan) used in the field for 2009 has also included the control of environmental pollutants in small egg producers. Following an irregular result, 12 laying hens were transferred into a laboratory controlled environment. Eggs were collected for 60 days and they were weekly analysed for the evaluation of dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs), and non-dioxin-like PCBs (NDL-PCBs, six congeners) levels. The dioxins and PCBs contents were determined, according to EPA methods, by gas chromatography ic determination coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC-HRMS). The content of PCDD/Fs, DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs was evaluated weekly by mean from week to week. The concentration of dioxins was lower than DL-PCBs (2.5 pg TEQ g(-1) of fat against 4.5 pg TEQ g(-1) of fat), but we observed the same depletion trend for both pollutants. On the opposite, NDL-PCBs had a different course: we noted there was an increase between weeks 6 and 7, but the mean levels remained very low (about 20 ng g(-1) of fat). The dioxins, and sum of dioxin and DL-PCBs concentration were below the fixed European limits (i.e. 3 pg TEQ g(-1) of fat for dioxins and 6 pg TEQ g(-1) of fat for sum of dioxins and DL-PCBs), beginning from the 3rd week of trial.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D002849', 'D004147', 'D004531', 'D004785', 'D005506', 'D007558', 'D013058', 'D011078', 'D000072317']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Dioxins', 'Eggs', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Food Contamination', 'Italy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins']",Depletion study of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs concentrations in contaminated home-produced eggs: preliminary study.,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000031']","['methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analogs & derivatives']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20579489,2010

The proposed method makes use of a modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rigged, and safe) procedure that combines isolation of the pesticides and sample clean-up in a single step. Analysis is performed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, acquiring two specific precursor-product ion transitions per target compound. Two main fragment ions for each pesticide were obtained to achieve the identification according to the SANCO guidelines 10684/2009. The method was validated with various food samples, including edible oil, meat, egg, cheese, chocolate, coffee, rice, tree nuts, citric fruits, vegetables, etc. No significant matrix effect was observed for tested pesticides, therefore, matrix-matched calibration was not necessary. Calibration curves were linear and covered from 1 to 20 microg L(-1) for all compounds studied. The average recoveries, measured at 10 microg kg(-1), were in the range 70-120% for all of the compounds tested with relative standard deviations below 20%, while a value of 10 microg kg(-1) has been established as the method limit of quantitation (MLOQ) for all target analytes. Similar trueness and precision results were also obtained for spiking at 200 microg kg(-1). Expanded uncertainty values were in the range 21-27% while the HorRat ratios were below 1.

Protein-based immunochemical methods, including ELISA as an initial screening quantitative analysis and immunoblotting as a final confirmatory qualitative analysis, were very sensitive and specific in detecting potentially allergenic egg residues in processed foods in trace amounts. In contrast, the proteomics-based, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS and LC-tandem quadrupole time-of-flight MS methods were not able to detect some egg allergens, such as ovomucoid, because of its nondenaturing property under urea and trypsin.

Linear PFOS (n-perfluoro-1-octanesulfonate (L-PFOS)) consistently dominated the isomer pattern in all eggs, comprising between 95.0% and 98.3% of the summation sigmaPFOS concentration. L-PFOS was highly enriched in the gull eggs as the summation sigmabranched-PFOS to L-PFOS isomer concentration ratios were very constant (overall average 0.038 +/- 0.001) and much lower compared to technical PFOS (range 0.27-0.54). The highest proportions of L-PFOS were generally observed in the eggs from the lower lakes (Erie and Ontario) colonies. All six mono(trifluoromethyl) branched isomers, or perfluoro-n-methyl-heptanesulfonates where n describes the carbon of the hydrocarbon chain were there is trifluoromethyl substitution relative to the sulfonate terminal group, were detected in the eggs from all the colonies. For example, P1MHpS is perfluoro-1-methyl-heptanesulfonate. Comparable to technical PFOS (T-PFOS), the percentage of the mono(trifluoromethyl) isomer to summation sigmaPFOS concentration decreased as the branch substitution was located closer to the sulfonate group, that is, P6MHpS (0%-2.5%), P5MHpS (0.43%-1.18%), P4MHpS (0.25%-0.69%), and P3MHpS (0.32%-0.74%). Although at even lower fractional composition than the mono(trifluoromethyl) isomers, of the di(trifluoromethyl) isomers, detected in >60% of the individual eggs per site was P35DMHxS and P45DMHxS for Toronto Harbour (Lake Ontario), P35DMHxS for Chantry (Lake Huron) and Fighting Island (Detroit River), and P45DMHxS for Gull Island (Lake Michigan). Relative to T-PFOS, and independent of colonial location, the high and consistent enrichment of L-PFOS in gull eggs is likely a function of several processes including PFOS or precursor sources, and isomer-specific PFOS or precursor exposure, accumulation, biotransformation, retention and/or elimination. The results of this study suggests that the apparent dilution of the mono(fluoromethyl) isomers from environmental processes that occur prior to final accumulation in herring gull eggs, is independent of the mono(fluoromethyl) isomer structure.",Environmental science & technology,"['D017738', 'D025041', 'D000818', 'D046091', 'D002853', 'D004032', 'D004531', 'D005466', 'D005618', 'D008401', 'D007536', 'D021241', 'D014874']","['Alkanesulfonic Acids', 'Animal Migration', 'Animals', 'Charadriiformes', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Diet', 'Eggs', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Fresh Water', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Isomerism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Linear and branched perfluorooctane sulfonate isomer patterns in herring gull eggs from colonial sites across the Laurentian Great Lakes.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000502', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, 'physiology', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20415439,2010

20339844,"Mycotoxins are natural contaminants produced by a range of fungal species. Their common occurrence in food and feed poses a threat to the health of humans and animals. This threat is caused either by the direct contamination of agricultural commodities or by a ""carry-over"" of mycotoxins and their metabolites into animal tissues, milk, and eggs after feeding of contaminated hay or corn. As a consequence of their diverse chemical structures and varying physical properties, mycotoxins exhibit a wide range of biological effects. Individual mycotoxins can be genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and oestrogenic. To protect consumer health and to reduce economic losses, surveillance and control of mycotoxins in food and feed has become a major objective for producers, regulatory authorities and researchers worldwide. However, the variety of chemical structures makes it impossible to use one single technique for mycotoxin analysis. Hence, a vast number of analytical methods has been developed and validated. The heterogeneity of food matrices combined with the demand for a fast, simultaneous and accurate determination of multiple mycotoxins creates enormous challenges for routine analysis. The most crucial issues will be discussed in this review.

20198525,"The analysis of 252 food samples (UK-produced and imported) purchased from a variety of retail outlets in the UK was undertaken for the presence of perfluorooctanesulphonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and nine other perfluorocompounds (PFCs). A limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 microg/kg was achieved for all target analytes, in all samples. Standard addition was used for quantification of PFC levels. All 11 of the targeted PFCs were detected in 75 individual food items. In 70% of the samples, including all meat other than offal, none of the analytes were present above the LOD. The highest levels found were 59 microg/kg perfluorooctanesulphonic acid (PFOS) and 63 microg/kg total PFCs (SigmaPFCs) in an eel sample, and 40 microg/kg PFOS (62 microg/kg SigmaPFCs) in a whitebait sample. The highest level in an offal sample was 10 microg/kg, in a wild roe deer liver. There were six samples with SigmaPFCs >15 microg/kg (fish, shellfish, crustaceans), a further seven samples with SigmaPFCs ranging 11-15 microg/kg (including a liver), nine with SigmaPFCs ranging 6-10 microg/kg (fish and livers), 31 with SigmaPFCs in the range 2-5 microg/kg (including kidneys, popcorn and processed peas) and a further 22 with SigmaPFCs close to the LOD of 1 microg/kg (including eggs and potatoes). These concentrations indicate that UK consumers are being exposed to a low level of PFC contamination from food. The estimated upper bound dietary intake of 10 ng/kg bodyweight (bw)/day of PFOS for average adult consumers is well below the 0.15 microg (150 ng)/kg bw tolerable daily intake (TDI) set by the European Food Safety Authority. The lower bound adult dietary intake estimate of 1 ng/kg bw/day is similar to estimates undertaken and reported in countries such as Canada, Germany and Spain.","Food additives & contaminants.

Dietary exposure to PBDEs was estimated using local food consumption data obtained from secondary school students in 2000 and the concentrations of PBDEs in food samples taken from local market in 2008. The PBDE levels on a fresh weight basis for fish ranged from 13 to 6600 pg g(-1), for seafood and seafood products ranged from 15 to 1200 pg g(-1), for meat and meat products ranged from 23 to 3500 pg g(-1), for poultry ranged from 68 to 670 pg g(-1), for eggs ranged from 280 to 800 pg g(-1), and for dairy products ranged from 12 to 480 pg g(-1). The dietary exposures of secondary school students for the average and high consumers were estimated to be 2.6 and 6.4 ng kg(-1) body weight day(-1), respectively. According to the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), for the more toxic PBDE congeners, adverse effects would be unlikely to occur in laboratory animals at doses of less than approximately 100 microg kg(-1) body weight day(-1). The resulting margins of exposures (38,000 for average consumers and 16,000 for high consumers) showed that the estimated dietary exposures of secondary school students were far below any adverse effect dose observed in laboratory animals and were therefore of low concern for human health.","Food additives & contaminants.

20089359,"Fasciola hepatica is responsible for human disease and economic livestock loss on a global scale. We report the first post-genomic investigation of cellular proteins expressed by embryonic F. hepatica via two-dimensional electrophoresis, image analysis and tandem mass spectrometry. Antioxidant proteins and protein chaperones are prominently expressed by embryonic F. hepatica. Molecular differences between the egg and other characterized F. hepatica lifecycle stages were noted. Furthermore, proteins expressed within liver fluke eggs differ to those isolated from the well-characterized eggs of the human blood flatworm Schistosoma mansoni were revealed. Plasticity in expression of major proteins, particularly a prominently expressed 65kDa protein cluster was seen between natural populations of embryonating F. hepatica eggs suggesting that liver fluke embryogenisis is a plastic process. Immunoblotting revealed that the abundant 65kDa protein cluster is recognised by infection sera from three F. hepatica challenged host species. Mass spectrometry and BLAST analyses demonstrated that the 65kDa antigen shows homology to egg antigens of other flatworm parasites, and is represented in a F. hepatica EST database constructed from adult fluke transcripts. EST clones encoding the egg antigen were re-sequenced, predicting two forms of the protein. Four clones predict a 312 aa polypeptide, three clones encode a putative 110 amino acid extension at the N-terminus which may be involved in protein secretion, although this extension was not expressed by natively extracted proteins. Consistent expression of alpha crystallin domains confirmed the protein to be a member of the alpha crystallin containing small heat shock protein (AC/sHSP) superfamily. AC/sHSPs are ubiquitous in nature, however, this is the first time a member of this protein superfamily has been described from F. hepatica. The antigenic AC/sHSP was named Fh-HSP35alpha based on predictions of molecular weight. Production of recombinant Fh-HSP35alpha reveals considerable mass discrepancy between native and recombinant proteins, although descriptions of other characterized flatworm AC/sHSPs, suggest that the native form is a dimer. Immunoblot analyses confirm that the recombinant protein is recognised by F. hepatica challenged hosts, but does not react with sera from non-infected animals. We discuss the potential of recombinant Fh-HSP35alpha as an egg-based diagnostic marker for liver fluke infection.",Veterinary parasitology,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D000947', 'D005210', 'D018507', 'D006360', 'D008969', 'D040901', 'D016415', 'D017386', 'D012756', 'D015053']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Helminth', 'Fasciola hepatica', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteomics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sheep', 'Zygote']",Proteomic analysis of embryonic Fasciola hepatica: characterization and antigenic potential of a developmentally regulated heat shock protein.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000196', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000254']","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'embryology', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'growth & development']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20089359,2010

Each day, contaminants were administered 1h after oviposition in one gelatin capsule. Eggs were collected daily during the 12d following the first dosing. Concentrations of PAHs and their main hydroxylated metabolites in yolk were determined using HPLC coupled with fluorimetric detection, while lindane was analysed by GC-ED. At the end of the experiment, hens were sacrified and preovulatory yolks were collected and weighed. All three PAHs were recovered in yolks, mainly as metabolites, indicating an active biotransformation of these compounds in hens. Within 10d, PAHs and metabolites concentrations in yolks were back to initial values. However, the recovery rate of these compounds to yolk calculated over the 12-d experiment, was very low, reaching 0.089%, 0.034% and 0.006% for Phe, Pyr and B[a]P, respectively. Daily deposition of yolk and of PAHs and metabolites were found to be directly proportional, indicating that no significant body storage of these PAHs occurred and that they were rapidly hydroxylated after ingestion.

20031237,"In this study Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were exposed to different levels of North Sea produced water (PW) and 17beta-oestradiol (E(2)), a natural oestrogen, from egg to fry stage (90 days). By comparing changes in protein expression following E(2) exposure to changes induced by PW treatment, we were able to compare the induced changes by PW to the mode of action of oestrogens. Changes in the proteome in response to exposure in whole cod fry (approximately 80 days post-hatching, dph) were detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and image analysis and identified by MALDI-ToF-ToF mass spectrometry, using a newly developed cod EST database and the NCBI database. Many of the protein changes occurred at low levels (0.01% and 0.1% PW) of exposure, indicating putative biological responses at lower levels than previously detected. Using discriminant analysis, we identified a set of protein changes that may be useful as biomarker candidates of produced water (PW) and oestradiol exposure in Atlantic cod fry. The biomarker candidates discovered in this study may, following validation, prove effective as diagnostic tools in monitoring exposure and effects of discharges from the petroleum industry offshore, aiding future environmental risk analysis and risk management.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D000818', 'D015415', 'D004781', 'D004784', 'D004958', 'D005260', 'D029941', 'D048389', 'D008297', 'D009659', 'D010063', 'D010578', 'D020543', 'D018675', 'D014873']","['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Fish Proteins', 'Gadus morhua', 'Male', 'North Sea', 'Ovum', 'Petroleum', 'Proteome', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Water Pollutants']",Biomarker candidate discovery in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) continuously exposed to North Sea produced water from egg to fry.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000254', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000633', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000633']","[None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'methods', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'growth & development', None, None, 'drug effects', 'toxicity', 'drug effects', None, 'toxicity']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20031237,2010

20006112,"Multidimensional analysis of instant coffee and barley beverage samples using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with a dynamic surface tension detector (DSTD) and a UV-vis absorbance detector (UV) is reported. A unique finding of this study was the action of the tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cation as a modifying agent (with bromide as the counter anion) that substantially increased the surface pressure signal and sensitivity of many of the proteins in the chromatographically separated samples. The tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) enhancement of the surface pressure signal was further investigated by studying the response of 12 commercial standard proteins (alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, human serum albumin (HSA), albumin from chicken egg white (OVA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), hemoglobin, alpha-chymotrypsinogen A, cytochrome C, myoglobin, RNase A, carbonic anhydrase, and lysozyme) in buffer performed using flow injection analysis (FIA) coupled with the DSTD with and without various concentrations of TBAB. The FIA-DSTD data show that 1mM TBAB enhances sensitivity of HSA detection, by lowering the limit of detection (LOD) from 2mg/mL to 0.1mg/mL. Similarly, the LOD for BSA was reduced from 1mg/mL to 0.2mg/mL. These FIA-DSTD experiments allowed the detection conditions to be optimized for further SEC-UV/DSTD experiments. Thus, the SEC-UV/DSTD system has been optimized and successfully applied to the selective analysis of surface-active protein fractions in a commercial instant coffee sample and in a soluble barley sample.

20006088,"In this study, oil-in-water formulations were optimized to determine sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and iron in emulsified egg samples by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). This method is simpler and requires fewer reagents when compared with other sample pre-treatment procedures and allows the calibration to be carried out using aqueous standards. Different oily phases such as corn oil, decyl oleate and octyl stearate were tested, as well as Tween 80, Triton X-100 and Triton 114 were analyzed as surfactants. The optimum type and proportion of formulations were determined and their use depended on the element studied. The emulsion preparation was performed by a conventional method that involves mixing both phases at 60 degrees C by magnetic stirring and phase inversion to change the water-to-oil ratio by increasing the volume of the surfactant-water external phase and correspondingly decreasing the volume of internal phase. The accuracy of the method was further confirmed by determining the metals in a whole egg powder CRM and recoveries ranged from 97.5% for Mg to 102.2% for Na, with relative standard deviations lower than 2.3%. The precision of the procedures was determined through repeatability (intra-day precision) and intermediate precision (inter-day). The repeatability presented RSD values lower than 4.2%. The intermediate precision was evaluated using the RSD and F-test. The RSD values to intermediate precision was lower than 5.3% and the computed F-values were lower than tabulated F-values, indicating no significant difference between the results obtained on different days.

19709935,"The enzyme lysozyme is used as a preservative to prevent late blowing of ripened cheese, caused by Clostridium tyrobutyricum. Since the enzyme is extracted from hen egg white, lysozyme has to be declared on food product labels as a potential allergen. Here, a method is reported that combines immunocapture purification and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis for the detection of lysozyme in cheese samples. Cheese extracts were treated with magnetic particles coated with a monoclonal antibody directed against lysozyme. After immunocapture purification, lysozyme was detected by MALDI-TOF-MS. The limit of detection of the assay was about 5mg/kg lysozyme in cheese. The method reliably distinguished between cheese samples which had been produced with and without lysozyme. Thus, the novel assay allows the reliable, sensitive, and specific detection of lysozyme in a food matrix. The assay could be easily adapted to other target peptides and proteins in complex food matrices and, therefore, has a broad application potential, e.g. for the analysis of allergens.","Journal of chromatography.

Three different formats were developed and characterized in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and rapidity. A competitive indirect ELISA was developed, which showed an IC(50) of 3.8 microg l(-1). Two competitive direct ELISAs were also developed, in which the antibody was added before or simultaneously with the other reagents; the first showed an IC(50) of 8.3 microg l(-1) and the latter showed an IC(50) of 4.9 microg l(-1). Nevertheless, considering dilution of extracts which is needed to offset matrix interference, the limits of detection of the three formats were substantially the same (10 microg kg(-1)). The antibodies in all three test formats were able to recognize Sudan I and partially Sudan II, III and IV; no cross-reactivity was observed with the five edible dyes. Twenty food samples, including chilli powder, paprika, ketchup, and egg, were extracted by a simple sample preparation and very limited dilution. Extracts were analyzed by the developed competitive direct ELISA with the simultaneous addition of reagents. A good correlation was observed (y = 1.19 x-10.0, r(2) = 0.991, n = 20) when the data was compared with that obtained through a conventional HPLC method.","Food additives & contaminants.

A total of 19 organochlorine pesticides were investigated in ten subsamples of maize, ten subsamples of cowpea and nine subsamples of drinking water. Analytical methods included solvent extraction of the pesticide residues and their subsequent quantification using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of pesticides were also determined. Pesticides residues in drinking water (0.04-0.40 microg l(-1)) were higher than the maximum residue limit (MRL) (0.03 microg l(-1)) set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor epoxide and endosulfan levels (13.16-98.79 microg kg(-1)) in cowpea grains exceeded MRLs applied in France (10-50 microg kg(-1)). Contaminants' levels in maize grains (0.53-65.70 microg kg(-1)) were below the MRLs (20-100 microg kg(-1)) set by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WHO. EDIs of the tested pesticides ranged from 0.02% to 162.07% of the acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). Population exposure levels of dieldrin and heptachlor epoxide were higher than the FAO/WHO standards.

As a result, this chemical and its contaminants or degradation products, such as polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs), may be present in eggs. The litter-to-eggs transfer and depletion of these compounds were studied in a flock of laying hens reared on contaminated wood shavings. PCP determination was carried out via high resolution gas chromatography coupled to low resolution mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (HRGC-LRMS/MS); PCDDs and PCDFs were quantified by HRGC-HRMS (SIM). After substitution of the litter contaminated with PCDDs and PCDFs at an average of 50 pg WHO-TE g(-1) and with PCP at 15 microg g(-1), pooled eggs from six selected hens were sampled twice a month for the depletion study. At steady state, PCDDs and PCDFs showed a transfer ratio of 0.9; for PCP it was 0.03. PCP concentration in eggs (500 ng g(-1) whole weight) fell sharply the second week after exposure withdrawal; for PCDDs and PCDFs (47 pg WHO-TE g(-1) fat, at day 0), the overall TEQ half-life was estimated at an average of 3.8 weeks. Due to differences in toxicokinetics (a faster depletion), PCP does not appear to be a suitable marker of PCDD and PCDF violative levels. However, the prominent analytical contribution of H(7)CCD and O(8)CCD in the contamination profile may help to trace the source of contamination. Among congeners, 2,3,7,8 T(4)CDF exhibited a different depletion pattern, indicating a possible mechanism of active transport.","Food additives & contaminants.

19609510,"Residual antimicrobials in food constitute a risk to human health. Although epidemiological data on the real magnitude of their adverse effects are very scarce, they indicate that food could be an important vehicle for evolution and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Public health agencies in many countries rely on detection by mass spectrometry (MS) for unambiguous identification of residues of antimicrobial agents in animal food products for human consumption. The introduction of relatively inexpensive and robust liquid chromatography (LC)-MS systems has given a strong impulse to the development of confirmatory methods for the above medicines in foodstuffs. The initial part of this review, after a brief introduction into the field of antimicrobials, is dedicated to the most important EU regulations and directives for control of residues of these substances in animal products. The main attention in this review is on the sample-treatment and MS detection systems in use today for analysing the most important classes of antimicrobials in various biological matrices (milk, animal tissues, eggs, and honey). As evidenced by this review, reversed-phase LC combined with tandem MS, usually triple-quadrupole MS (QqQMS), is currently the preferred technique in most residue analysis of a single-class of antimicrobials. A recently emerging analytical strategy is that of developing methods for detecting a large variety of veterinary drugs belonging to different classes, including pesticides (multi-class residue analysis). To do this, simple and generic extraction and separation techniques applicable to a broad range of compounds differing in physical and chemical properties have been adopted. Such methods are still based mainly on LC-QqQMS. Emerging alternative MS detection systems are time-of-flight MS, which provides accurate mass of the analyte(s), or Q-linear ion trap (IT) MS that eliminates some limitations of ITMS(n).",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D000900', 'D002853', 'D004350', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D013058']","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Drug Residues', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry']",Recent applications of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to residue analysis of antimicrobials in food of animal origin.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379']","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19609510,2010

The goal of this study was to determine baseline concentrations of several classes of POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in two turtle species, the Cumberland slider (Trachemys scripta troosti) and the common musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus) from the Tennessee River Gorge. Plasma samples from five male and five female adults of each species were analyzed for concentrations of 83 PCB congeners, six DDT compounds, four toxaphene congeners, 18 additional pesticides, pentachlorobenzene, octachlorostyrene, and 28 PBDE congeners using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In both species, total PCBs were the predominant contaminant class, at approximately 10-fold higher concentration than p,p'-DDE, total PBDEs, and total chlordanes. Mirex, dieldrin and one toxaphene congener (Parlar 50) were also detected at even lower concentrations. The female turtles had lower concentrations of some contaminants (PCB 153+132, oxychlordane, mirex, PBDE 153, PBDE 154, Sigma PBDEs) than males, suggesting maternal transfer to eggs. Cumberland sliders had lower concentrations of PCB 138, p,p'-DDE, Sigma DDTs, oxychlordane, PBDE 47, and PBDE 99 than musk turtles. The turtles had a unique PBDE pattern with PBDE 100 predominating. The POP concentrations were lower than those measured previously in other reptiles from contaminated sites where endocrine disruption has been observed. One exception was a female musk turtle with 29.9 ng g(-1) p,p'-DDE (wet mass basis), which is greater than the concentrations measured in reptiles with evidence of endocrine disruption.

Dry matter and total lipid contents, polar and neutral lipid classes and total lipid fatty acid contents were determined in the eggs of bluefin tuna and eggs and unfed larvae during the development of Atlantic bonito. Bluefin tuna eggs had slightly but significantly more dry mass than bonito eggs but very similar lipid content. However, bluefin tuna eggs presented a higher polar lipid content due to increased proportions of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Bonito eggs and larvae showed increasing dry mass and decreasing lipid content with development. The proportion of polar lipids increased due to increased PE, PS and PI, whereas choline-containing polar lipids (phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) remained relatively constant. Free cholesterol also increased, whereas the levels of other neutral lipids, especially triacylglycerol and steryl ester fractions, decreased, presumably due to utilization for energy to drive development. Bluefin tuna eggs had higher levels of n - 3 and n - 6 highly unsaturated fatty acids due to higher docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acid contents, respectively, than bonito eggs.

19219461,"Food web structure regulates the pathways and flow rates of energy, nutrients, and contaminants to top predators. Ecologically and physiologically meaningful biochemical tracers provide a means to characterize and quantify these transfers within food webs. In this study, changes in the ratios of stable N isotopes (e.g., delta(15)N), fatty acids (FA), and persistent contaminants were used to trace food web pathways utilized by herring gulls (Larus argentatus) breeding along the shores of the St Lawrence River, Canada. Egg delta(15)N values varied significantly among years and were used as an indicator of gull trophic position. Temporal trends in egg delta(15)N values were related to egg FA profiles. In years when egg delta(15)N values were greater, egg FA patterns reflected the consumption of more aquatic prey. Egg delta(15)N values were also correlated with annual estimates of prey fish abundance. These results indicated that temporal changes in aquatic prey availability were reflected in the gull diet (as inferred from ecological tracer profiles in gull eggs). Analysis of individual eggs within years confirmed that birds consuming more aquatic prey occupied higher trophic positions. Furthermore, increases in trophic position were associated with increased concentrations of most persistent organic contaminants in eggs. However, levels of highly brominated polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners, e.g, 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-decabromoDE (BDE-209), showed a negative relationship with trophic position.

The purpose of this work was to study the effect of cooking methods on the production of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides. Boiled or fried eggs (in the forms of whites, yolks, and whole eggs) were digested by gastrointestinal tract proteases at simulated gut conditions. Fried egg digests showed more potent activity than those of boiled egg digests; the fried whole egg digest had an IC(50) value of 0.009 mg protein/mL. This hydrolysate was further purified by cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. Seven peptides, Val-Asp-Phe (IC(50): 6.59 microM), Leu-Pro-Phe (10.59 microM), Met-Pro-Phe (17.98 microM), Tyr-Thr-Ala-Gly-Val (23.38 microM), Glu-Arg-Tyr-Pro-Ile (8.76 microM), Ile-Pro-Phe (8.78 microM), and Thr-Thr-Ile (24.94 microM), were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and their IC(50) values were predicted by using our previously reported structure and activity models. The presence of several tripeptides from in vitro simulated gastrointestinal egg digest indicates that these peptides may be absorbed into the body and exert an in vivo antihypertensive activity, although in vivo study is needed to confirm this assumption.

19061266,"During the period 2003-2004, 110 samples of sewage sludge were examined from 18 treatment plants located in the territory of the whole of Poland, the majority in the Lublin Province. Samples of fermented and dehydrated sewage sludge were taken from sludge drying beds. The bacteriological and parasitological determinations covered bacteria of the Salmonella genus and eggs of the helminths Ascaris spp., Trichuris spp., and Toxocara spp. Chemical examinations for the presence of the heavy metals: chromium, zinc, cadmium, copper, nickel and lead were carried out by the method of atomic absorption flame spectrophotometry. The results were subjected to statistical analysis with the use of ANOVA and Student's t-tests. In the sewage sludge samples examined, Salmonella bacteria were isolated from 9 samples (8.2 % ), and the eggs of helminths from 31 samples (28.1 % ). The eggs of Ascaris spp. were most frequently detected--in 24 samples of sewage sludge (21.8 % ), followed by Trichuris spp. eggs--in 11 samples (10.0 % ), and Toxocara spp. eggs--in 6 samples (5.4 % ). Several samples of sewage sludge were infected by eggs of all the parasites examined (ATT). A very high variation was observed with respect to Salmonella bacteria and ATT eggs according to the origin, type of sanitation and duration of deposition of sludge. Levels of chromium, zinc, copper and lead in the sewage sludge samples, in the majority of samples examined, remained below allowable values. Very high values exceeding the allowable values for the levels of heavy metals were observed only in the samples of sewage sludge from one treatment plant. This concerned a cadmium level (201.1 mg/kg d.m.) which exceeded by 20 times the most rigorous allowable contents of this metal for sewage sludge designed for agricultural use, and nickel (288.7 mg/kg d.m.)--the standard being exceeded 3 times. A significant variation of the levels of heavy metals was observed depending on treatment type. A longer period of deposition of sludge on plots (over 6 months) causes a significant decrease of cadmium level, a decrease in the amount of Salmonella bacteria, and total elimination of Toxocara eggs. In the majority of cases no significant correlation was observed between the level of heavy metals and biological contaminants.

Developing rapid and cost-effective techniques for identifying pathogens to subspecies is critical for tracking causes of foodborne disease outbreaks. The objective of this study was to develop a method for rapid identification and differentiation of Salmonella serovars and strains within these serovars through isolation on hydrophobic grid membrane filters (HGMFs), examination by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and microspectroscopy, and data analysis by multivariate statistical techniques. Salmonella serovars (Anatum, Enteritidis, Heidelberg, Kentucky, Muenchen, and Typhimurium), most of which were represented by multiple strains, were grown in tryptic soy broth (24 h at 42 degrees C), diluted to 10(2) to 10(3) CFU/ml, and filtered using HGMFs. The membranes were incubated on Miller-Mallinson agar (24 h at 42 degrees C), and typical Salmonella colonies were sonicated in 50% acetonitrile and centrifuged. Resulting pellets were vacuum dried on a ZnSe crystal and analyzed using IR spectroscopy. Alternatively, the membranes containing Salmonella growth were removed from the agar, vacuum dried, and colonies were analyzed directly by IR microspectroscopy. Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) models were developed from spectra. The method was validated by analyzing Salmonella-inoculated tomato juice, eggs, milk, and chicken. Salmonella serovars exhibited distinctive and reproducible spectra in the fingerprint region (1,200 to 900 cm(-1)) of the IR spectrum. SIMCA permitted distinguishing Salmonella strains from each other through differences in bacterial lipopolysaccharides and other membrane components. The model correctly predicted Salmonella in foods at serovar (100%) and strain (90%) levels.

This study was set up to develop a new high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method to detect clazuril (CZ: (+/-)-2-chloro-alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-(4,5-dihydro-3,5-dioxo-1,2,4-triazin-2(3H)-yl)-benzeneacetonitrile) in egg yolk and albumen and in plasma; to investigate both the presence of residues of CZ in eggs and its pharmacokinetic behaviour in laying hens. 3. A single oral dose (3 mg/kg BW) and multiple oral doses (3 mg/kg BW for 5 d) were investigated. The analytical method gave very good recovery (64 to 74%) in the three different matrices (yolk, albumen and plasma); precision and accuracy were within 11%. 4. After a single dose no residue was detected in eggs collected for up to 10 d, while following multiple dose treatment, CZ residues were detected until 10 d after the end of treatment. The concentration of the drug was higher in yolk than in albumen with a maximum ratio of 10 : 1. 5. Pharmacokinetics of CZ in laying hens after a single dose showed a detectable concentration of the drug up to 24 h. It reached a steady state after the third administration in multiple dosing. 6. Although further studies are necessary, these results indicate that a single oral dose of CZ could be used as an anticoccidial for laying hens due to the lack of residues in eggs.",British poultry science,"['D000097', 'D000418', 'D000821', 'D000818', 'D019540', 'D002645', 'D002851', 'D003049', 'D004334', 'D004350', 'D004530', 'D004531', 'D005260', 'D006207', 'D015394', 'D015203', 'D014227']","['Acetonitriles', 'Albumins', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Area Under Curve', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coccidiostats', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Residues', 'Egg Yolk', 'Eggs', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Molecular Structure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Triazines']","Pharmacokinetic study of clazuril (Appertex) in eggs and plasma from laying hens after single or multiple treatments, using a new HPLC method for detection.","['Q000097', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000662', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000097']","['blood', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'veterinary', 'blood', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18836908,2009

18707690,"Specific allergen immunotherapy is frequently associated with adverse reactions. Several strategies are being developed to reduce the allergenicity while maintaining the therapeutic benefits. Peptide immunotherapy is one such approach. Methods for the simple and rapid identification of immunogenic epitopes of allergens (i.e. allergenic epitopes) are ongoing and could potentially lead to peptide-based vaccines. An epitope extraction technique, based on biofunctionalized magnetic microspheres self-organized under a magnetic field in a channel of a simple microfluidic device fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane, was applied in the isolation and identification of prospective allergenic epitopes. Similarly to chromatographic column separations, the easily replaceable plug of self-organized beads in the channel benefits especially from an even larger surface-to-volume ratio and an enhanced interaction of the surfaces with passing samples. Ovalbumin, the major protein of egg white and a typical representative of food allergens, was selected as the model molecule. Highly resistant ovalbumin was at first efficiently digested by a magnetic proteolytic reactor with trypsin treated with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and the second step, i.e. capture of allergenic epitopes from the mixture of peptides, was performed by a magnetic immunoaffinity carrier with orientedly immobilized rabbit anti-ovalbumin IgG molecules. Captured peptides were released with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution fractions were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The peptide fragment of ovalbumin HIATNAVLFFGR (m/z: 1345.75, position: 371-382) was identified as a relevant allergenic epitope in this way. Such a microfluidic magnetic force-based epitope extraction technique applied in the epitope mapping of ovalbumin has the potential to be a significant step towards developing safe and cost-effective epitope-based vaccines.",Journal of chromatography.

18667209,"Gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) is one of the most powerful techniques in pesticide residue analysis. MS/MS can be conceived in two ways: tandem in space (e.g. triple quadrupole, QqQ) or in time (e.g. ion trap, IT). QqQ and IT are commonly interfaced to GC; however, there has not been any direct comparison between them in pesticide residue analysis so far. In the present work, the performance of GC coupled to these two analyzers (GC-QqQ-MS/MS and GC-IT-MS/MS) was studied and compared for pesticide residue analysis as well as its application in food analysis. The large volume injection (LVI) technique together with programmed-temperature vaporization (PTV) was applied. For this purpose, 19 pesticides, including organochlorine and organophophorus pesticides and pyrethroids, were analyzed in both systems. Mass spectrometric data, performance characteristics (linearity, intra-day and inter-day precision) and the influence of the matrix nature on the analysis of low concentrations were compared. The target compounds were analyzed in solvent and in two representative food matrices such as cucumber (high water content) and egg (high fat content). MS data and intra-day precision were similar in QqQ and IT, whereas inter-day precision was significantly worse in QqQ. Linearity (expressed as determination coefficient, R(2)) in the range 10-150 microg L(-1) was adequate in both systems; however, better R(2) values were obtained with the QqQ analyzer in high and low concentration ranges (1-50 and 1-750 microg L(-1), respectively). The influence of the matrix nature on the analysis of low concentrations of each analyzer was also evaluated. The QqQ and IT performance was similar in cucumber and solvent. However, QqQ provided better sensitivity in egg working in selected reaction monitoring (SRM).",Journal of chromatography.

The main challenge was to detect flumequine in an assay giving good results for the other compounds. One antigen-antibody combination proved satisfactory: polyclonal antibodies raised against a dual immunogen and, on the sensor chip, a fluoroquinolone derivative.

In all species, the residue pattern was dominated by hexaBBs. The dominating congeners were PBB 153, PBB 154, and PBB 155. Whereas PBB 153 is present in technical hexabromobiphenyl, PBB 154 and PBB 155 are formed by the reductive debromination of decabromobiphenyl. This was evidenced by the detection of several heptaBBs and octaBBs all of which are typical degradation intermediates of PBB 209. Hepta- and octaBBs were more than one order of magnitude less abundant than the hexaBBs. The second most prevailing homologue group was pentaBBs. The most relevant pentabrominated isomers were PBB 99 and PBB 101. Concentrations of the three hexaBBs--PBB 153, PBB 154, and PBB 155--amounted to 1.3-13 ng/g wet weight or 3-23% of the contamination with polybrominated diphenyl ethers.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D000818', 'D020307', 'D004531', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D005411', 'D008401', 'D009664', 'D011075']","['Animals', 'Eagles', 'Eggs', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Flame Retardants', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Norway', 'Polybrominated Biphenyls']",Detailed analysis of polybrominated biphenyl congeners in bird eggs from Norway.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18472199,2009

Both bee species respond to some scent compounds emitted by L. punctata, and two compounds, which were also found in scent samples collected from a Macropis nest entrance, elicited clear signals in the antennae of both species. These compounds may not only play a role for host plant detection by Macropis, but also for host nest detection by Epeoloides.

In DSSBME, the organic solvent was confined to a pair of hollow fiber membrane fixed on a stir bar, which can stir by itself, while the hollow fiber in U-shaped HF-LPME was fixed by two microsyringes. The significant factors affecting the microextraction of Sudan dyes in both microextraction techniques have been examined and no obvious difference in the effect of extraction solvent, pH and salt concentration on the extraction efficiency of Sudan dyes was observed except extraction time and stirring speed. Both microextraction techniques were similar in terms of analytical performance from aqueous solutions (LODs ranged from 0.09 to 0.95 microgL(-1) by HPLC-UV and 2.5-6.2 microgL(-1) by HPLC-MS; the absolute LODs ranged from 0.9 to 11.25 pg by HPLC-UV and 5-21.2 pg by HPLC-MS), however, DSSBME was more stable (lower stirring speed required), less sample consuming and much shorter time required to reach extraction equilibrium; while U-shaped HF-LPME was easier to operate and no more special device required. The two microextraction techniques combined with HPLC-UV/MS were successfully applied to the analysis of real samples including strawberry sauce, capsicum oil, salted egg, and two kinds of chilli sauce. Although the LODs of HPLC-UV are lower than that of HPLC-MS by a factor of 10 in this work, the absolute LODs for both HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS are comparable. HPLC-UV cannot identify the suspicious peaks at the same retention time as that of Sudan II and III in salted egg, while HPLC-MS can give exact information of Sudan I-IV in real sample analysis and is more reliable.

The investigation focused on the pasteurized egg as starting material, intermediate, and final products of a nine-step manufacturing process performed for use of eggs in convenience products appropriate for allergic individuals. The steps consisted of a combination of various heat treatments and enzymatic hydrolyses. The alterations were controlled by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), immunoblotting, enzyme allergosorbent test (EAST) inhibition, and mass spectrometry. Thereby it could be demonstrated that the allergenic potential of the raw material was reduced from step to step, and despite the known stability against heat and proteolysis of certain egg proteins, the total allergenic potential was finally below 1/100 that of the starting material without a significant change in texture and flavor as evaluated in various products.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D021181', 'D015387', 'D004531', 'D015180', 'D004591', 'D005511', 'D006801', 'D006868', 'D015151', 'D013058', 'D011489']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Egg Hypersensitivity', 'Egg Proteins, Dietary', 'Eggs', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Food Handling', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Protein Denaturation']",In vitro determination of the allergenic potential of technologically altered hen's egg.,"[None, None, 'Q000517', 'Q000009', None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'prevention & control', 'adverse effects', None, None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18260628,2008

The specificity of the ELISA developed to the SMZ was high according to the results of cross-reactivity testing with 14 kinds of sulphonamides. To obtain a more sensitive immunoassay, buffer solution (30 mmol L(-1) phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.5) was optimized through the whole test procedure. A simple and efficient extraction method for the rapid detection of SMZ residues in foods was developed, with recoveries between 74 and 117.5%. Matrix effects can be avoided by 1:10 dilution of pig muscle, chicken muscle, egg, fish, milk and liver with optimal buffer. The detection limit of SMZ was 5 microg kg(-1) in liver and 2 microg kg(-1) in the other five samples. For the validation of the ELISA tests, sample extracts were analysed by ELISA and high-performance liquid chromatography. The results obtained by these two methods showed a good correlation (r(2)) which was greater than 0.9.

17995718,"Recombinant chum salmon cystatin (RC) expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified by His-select nickel affinity chromatography. The specific inhibitory activities of RC against papain and cathepsin L were 7.45 and 10.24 U/mg, respectively. RC was stable over pH 5.0 to 7.0 and at temperature below 65 degrees C. RC was used to prevent the gel weakening of Alaska pollock surimi. RC at 100 microg/g showed the highest inhibitory activity against the autolysis of surimi based on the analysis of TCA-soluble peptides. As the concentration of RC increased, both the breaking force and deformation of modori gel greatly increased (P < 0.05). The addition of RC resulted in less expressible drip, which coincided with the increase of whiteness. More myosin heavy chain (MHC) was retained as the addition of RC increased. Therefore, RC could prevent the degradation of proteins in Alaska pollock surimi and was better than egg white (EW). Thus, RC could be applied to Alaska pollock surimi to prevent gel weakening and RC at 100 microg/g was the optimal concentration.",Journal of food science,"['D000818', 'D002403', 'D002846', 'D015891', 'D015853', 'D004305', 'D005396', 'D005511', 'D005782', 'D006863', 'D010206', 'D011994', 'D012441', 'D013696']","['Animals', 'Cathepsins', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cystatins', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fish Products', 'Food Handling', 'Gels', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Papain', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Temperature']",Application of recombinant chum salmon cystatin to Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) surimi to prevent gel weakening.,"[None, 'Q000037', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000037', 'Q000494', None, None]","[None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', None, None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'pharmacology', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17995718,2007
17980142,"Whereas the bearing of mass measurement error on protein identification is sometimes underestimated, uncertainty in observed peptide masses unavoidably translates to ambiguity in subsequent protein identifications. Although ongoing instrumental advances continue to make high accuracy mass spectrometry (MS) increasingly accessible, many proteomics experiments are still conducted with rather large mass error tolerances. In addition, the ranking schemes of most protein identification algorithms do not include a meaningful incorporation of mass measurement error. This article provides a critical evaluation of mass error tolerance as it pertains to false positive peptide and protein associations resulting from peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) database searching. High accuracy, high resolution PMFs of several model proteins were obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTICR-MS). Varying levels of mass accuracy were simulated by systematically modulating the mass error tolerance of the PMF query and monitoring the effect on figures of merit indicating the PMF quality. Importantly, the benefits of decreased mass error tolerance are not manifest in Mowse scores when operating at tolerances in the low parts-per-million range but become apparent with the consideration of additional metrics that are often overlooked. Furthermore, the outcomes of these experiments support the concept that false discovery is closely tied to mass measurement error in PMF analysis. Clear establishment of this relation demonstrates the need for mass error-aware protein identification routines and argues for a more prominent contribution of high accuracy mass measurement to proteomic science.",Analytical biochemistry,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D016172', 'D004531', 'D006454', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D010047', 'D010455', 'D011336', 'D011506', 'D012680', 'D017550']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'Eggs', 'Hemoglobins', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Ovalbumin', 'Peptides', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared']",Systematic characterization of high mass accuracy influence on false discovery and probability scoring in peptide mass fingerprinting.,"[None, None, 'Q000592', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000235', None, None]","[None, None, 'standards', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'genetics', 'chemistry', None, 'genetics', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17980142,2008

The ELISA method was used for analysis of a selection of samples and the results and method requirement compared with HPLC. The 2 h competitive ELISA showed a minimum detection limit of 0.05 ng mL(-1) and a dynamic range 0.1-2 ng mL(-1). Investigation of atrazine concentration in a selection of trophic chain samples indicated that the content of atrazine (microg kg(-1)) in soil samples was 3.2-85.4, vegetable roots 32.9-148.9, green parts of plants 67.7-136.4, cereals 42.4-91.5 and samples of animal origin 1.3-8.4. The correlation between results obtained by HPLC and ELISA methods was 0.97. In addition, simazine content was determined by the HPLC method in which the detection limits were 0.2 microg g(-1) for atrazine and 0.3 microg g(-1) for simazine. The content (microg kg(-1)) of simazine in soil samples was 13.5-15.5, in vegetables roots 29.5-93.7, in green parts of plants 34.6-72.6 and in cereals 158-189. The study demonstrates the utility and convenience of the simple, practical and cost-effective ELISA method in a non-immunoassay laboratory for the analysis of food and environmental samples. The method is ideal for the rapid screening of large numbers of samples in laboratories where access to HPLC facilities is limited or lacking.

An analytical method based on GC-MS/MS was developed for steroid measurement at an ultra-trace level in food products. The limits of detection for oestrogens were about 5 and 30 ng kg(-1) in milk and eggs, respectively. For androgens, the limits of detection were around 10 and 50 ng kg(-1) in milk and eggs, respectively. The method was applied to milk and egg samples collected in a French supermarket. In milk, oestrone was found at levels between 100 and 300 ng l(-1), while 17beta-oestradiol levels were estimated to be near 20 ng l(-1). 17alpha-testosterone was found to be from 50 ng l(-1) in skimmed milk to 85 ng l(-1) in whole milk.

17714685,"Based on a number of experiments it is concluded that the fluorescein labeled beta-heptapeptide fluoresceinyl-NH-CS-(S)-beta(3)hAla-(S)-beta(3)hArg-(R)-beta(3)hLeu-(S)-beta(3)hPhe-(S)-beta(3)hAla-(S)-beta(3)hAla-(S)-beta(3)hLys-OH translocates across lipid vesicle bilayers formed from DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). The conclusion is based on the following observations: (i) addition of the peptide to the vicinity of micrometer-sized giant vesicles leads to an accumulation of the peptide inside the vesicles; (ii) if the peptide is injected inside individual giant vesicles, it is released from the vesicles in a time dependent manner; (iii) if the peptide is encapsulated within sub-micrometer-sized large unilamellar vesicles, it is released from the vesicles as a function of time; (iv) if the peptide is submitted to immobilized liposome chromatography, the peptide is retained by the immobilized DOPC vesicles. Furthermore, the addition of the peptide to calcein-containing DOPC vesicles does not lead to significant calcein leakage and vesicle fusion is not observed. The finding that derivatives of the beta-heptapeptide (S)-beta(3)hAla-(S)-beta(3)hArg-(R)-beta(3)hLeu-(S)-beta(3)hPhe-(S)-beta(3)hAla-(S)-beta(3)hAla-(S)-beta(3)hLys-OH can translocate across phospholipid bilayers is supported by independent measurements using Tb(3+)-containing large unilamellar vesicles prepared from egg phosphatidylcholine and wheat germ phosphatidylinositol (molar ratio of 9:1) and a corresponding peptide that is labeled with dipicolinic acid instead of fluorescein. The experiments show that this dipicolinic acid labeled beta-heptapeptide derivative also permeates across phospholipid bilayers.

The samples were first monitored by microbiological assay using Escherichia coli as the reference organism, and were then quantified using HPLC with a fluorescence detector. Egg samples were extracted by the liquid-phase extraction process, and the analytes were analyzed via an ODS column using a mixture of acetonitrile and 0.4% phosphoric acid-0.4% triethylamine (15: 85, v/v) as a mobile phase (pH=2) without purification. The calibration curves were linear (r2>or=0.999) over a concentration range of 0.1-1.0 microg/mL. The majority of the mean recoveries at four different fortification levels, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 ppm, ranged from 73.7+/-7.2% to 87.1+/-12.7%, and the repeatability (as the relative standard deviation) from three repetitive determinations of recovery was between 1.03 and 18.83%. The calculated limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 9 ppb for CFX, EFX and NFX and 0.6 ppb for DFX. Both the bioassay and HPLC methods were applied to 120 total egg samples collected from the six major cities in the Republic of Korea. The bioassay, showed that two samples were positive (i.e contained inhibiting substances). On the other hand, the results of HPLC only identified and quantified the residues of enrofloxacin (from 0.43 to 1.02 ppm) in three samples out of 120.

17704396,"To decrease dioxin uptake by the general population the European Union (EU) has set limits to the dioxin content of many foodstuffs including eggs. Eggs from free foraging chickens are known to have a higher dioxin content compared with confined laying hens, and the question is whether these eggs can adhere to current EU regulations. The aim of the study was to investigate parameters that are involved in the contamination of eggs from chickens raised under organic conditions. Samples from 34 organic farms including soil and earthworm samples were collected between September and December of the year 2003. Dioxin levels were assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Various parameters were collected by on farm interviews. Egg dioxin content varied between 0.4 and 8.1 pg of toxic equivalents (TEQ)/g of egg fat with a mean of 2.2 pg of TEQ/g of egg fat. Nine out of 34 farms exceeded the EU limit of 3 pg of TEQ/g of egg fat. In addition, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCB) were measured, and 8 samples exceeded the limit for the sum of dioxins and DL-PCB. Overall, egg samples from 10 farms were noncompliant with the dioxin or total TEQ limits. No statistically significant relation could be observed between egg dioxin levels and the concentration observed in soil or earthworms. A statistically significant association was observed between flock size and egg dioxin and DL-PCB content. This effect is most likely attributable to the fact that flock size is related to the time chickens spend outside. Restricting outdoor run use on one of the farms resulted in a decrease of the egg dioxin content to a level that was within the EU limits. This demonstrates that the most likely contamination source is the soil or soil organisms but that the behavior of the hens determines the extent of the contamination. Following the completion of this study, a dioxin monitoring protocol has been set up in the Netherlands to prevent marketing of eggs with raised dioxin levels.",Poultry science,"['D000821', 'D000822', 'D000818', 'D002645', 'D003430', 'D004147', 'D004531', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D010063', 'D011078', 'D012989']","['Animal Feed', 'Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dioxins', 'Eggs', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Ovum', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Soil Pollutants']",Effect of flock size on dioxin levels in eggs from chickens kept outside.,"[None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'methods', None, 'physiology', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17704396,2007

We used the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test to assess T-lymphocyte function and the sheep red blood cell (SRBC) hemagglutination test to measure antibody-mediated immunity. The PHA stimulation index among chicks receiving dietary Hg treatment did not differ significantly from those of chicks on the control diet (p = 0.15). Total antibody (immunoglobulin [Ig] M [primary antibody] + IgG [secondary response]) production to the SRBC antigen in chicks treated with dietary methylmercury (MeHg), however, was suppressed (p = 0.04) relative to chicks on control diets. Analysis indicated suppression of total Ig production (p = 0.025 with comparisonwise alpha level = 0.017) between control and 0.4 microg Hg/g wet food intake treatment groups. Furthermore, the control group exhibited a higher degree of variability in antibody response compared to the Hg groups, suggesting that in addition to reducing the mean response, Hg treatment reduced the normal variation attributable to other biological factors. We observed bursal lymphoid depletion in chicks receiving the 1.2 microg Hg/g treatment (p = 0.017) and a marginally significant effect (p = 0.025) in chicks receiving the 0.4 microg Hg/g diet. These findings suggest that common loon chick immune systems may be compromised at an ecologically relevant dietary exposure concentration (0.4 microg Hg/g wet wt food intake).

17438766,"Bioaccumulation of synthetic musks in a marine food chain was investigated by analyzing marine organisms at various trophic levels, including lugworm, clam, crustacean, fish, marine mammal, and bird samples collected from tidal flat and shallow water areas of the Ariake Sea, Japan. Two of the polycyclic musks, HHCB and AHTN, were the dominant compounds found in most of the samples analyzed, whereas nitro musks were not detected in any of the organisms, suggesting greater usage of polycyclic musks relative to the nitro musks in Japan. The highest concentrations of HHCB were detected in clams (258-2730 ng/g lipid wt.), whereas HHCB concentrations in mallard and black-headed gull were low, and comparable with concentrations in fish and crab. These results are in contrast to the bioaccumulation pattern of polychlorinated biphenyls; for which a positive correlation between the concentration and the trophic status of organisms was found. Such a difference in the bioaccumulation is probably due to the metabolism and elimination of HHCB in higher trophic organisms. Temporal trends in concentrations of synthetic musks were examined by analyzing tissues of marine mammals from Japanese coastal waters collected during 1977-2005. HHCB concentrations in marine mammals have shown significant increase since the early 1990s, suggesting a continuous input of this compound into the marine environment. Comparison of the time trend for HHCB with those for PCBs and PBDEs suggested that the rates of increase in HHCB concentrations were higher than the other classes of pollutants.

17419640,"During routine gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC/ECD) analysis of chicken eggs, we observed that the most prominent peak in some samples did not match the retention time of any of the food contaminants screened. Subsequent GC coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) studies clarified that the mass spectrum of the peak was very similar to hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), which was also identified by GC/MS in the egg. The unknown compound was positively identified as pentabromocyclododecene (PBCDE), a metabolite of HBCD detected for the first time in foodstuffs. Studies of the analytical method used for the analysis of pesticides and contaminants showed that this cleanup method was suitable for the determination of HBCD and PBCDE, but storage of sample extracts resulted in the loss of HBCD when the sample extracts were not sufficiently purified. The concentrations of HBCD and PBCDE in the high polluted sample were 2.0 and 3.6 mg/kg egg fat. HBCD and PBCDE were also detected in two additional eggs at lower levels (<0.15 mg/kg), whereas 75 eggs did not contain these compounds (<0.02 mg/kg). We also detected HBCD and PBCDE in two samples of whitefish (Coregonus sp.), while an eel sample (Anguilla anguilla) positively tested for HBCD did not contain PBCDE.

These approaches involve identifying differences in elemental concentrations or sample-specific isotopic composition (Sr and Os) variations. Concentrations of 72 elements were determined by ICP-SFMS following microwave-assisted digestion in vendace and whitefish caviar samples from Sweden (from both brackish and freshwater), Finland and USA, as well as in unprocessed vendace roe and salt used in caviar production. This data set allows identification of elements whose contents in caviar can be affected by salt addition as well as by contamination during production and packaging. Long-term method reproducibility was assessed for all analytes based on replicate caviar preparations/analyses and variations in element concentrations in caviar from different harvests were evaluated. The greatest utility for differentiation was demonstrated for elements with varying concentrations between brackish and freshwaters (e.g. As, Br, Sr). Elemental ratios, specifically Sr/Ca, Sr/Mg and Sr/Ba, are especially useful for authentication of vendace caviar processed from brackish water roe, due to the significant differences between caviar from different sources, limited between-harvest variations and relatively high concentrations in samples, allowing precise determination by modern analytical instrumentation. Variations in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio for vendace caviar from different harvests (on the order of 0.05-0.1%) is at least 10-fold less than differences between caviar processed from brackish and freshwater roe. Hence, Sr isotope ratio measurements (either by ICP-SFMS or by MC-ICP-MS) have great potential for origin differentiation.

Among the intrinsic fluorophores, only the principal component analysis (PCA) applied on the vitamin A fluorescence spectra allowed a good identification of eggs as a function of their storage time. Factorial discriminant analysis (FDA) was then applied on the first five principal components (PCs) of the PCA applied on each spectral data set. Regarding AAA+NA recorded on thick albumen, correct classification of 69.4% and 63.9% was observed for the calibration and validation sets, respectively. Quite similar results were obtained on AAA+NA scanned on egg yolks. The best results were obtained with vitamin A fluorescence spectra since 97.7% and 85.7% of the calibration and validation sets was obtained, respectively.

17351671,"Transferrins play a major role in iron homeostasis and metabolism. In vertebrates, these proteins are synthesised in the liver and dispersed within the organism by the bloodstream. In oviparous vertebrates additional expression is observed in the oviduct and the synthesised protein is deposited in egg white as ovotransferrin. Most research on ovotransferrin has been performed on the chicken protein. There is a limited amount of information on other bird transferrins, and until our previous paper on red-eared turtle protein there was no data on the isolation, sequencing and biochemical properties of reptilian ovotransferrins. Recently our laboratory deposited ten new sequences of reptilian transferrins in the EMBL database. A comparative analysis of these sequences indicates a possibility of different mechanisms of iron release among crocodile and snake transferrin. In the present paper we follow with the purification and analysis of the basic biochemical properties of two crocodile (Crocodilus niloticus, C. rhombifer) and one snake (Python molurus bivittatus) ovotransferrins. The proteins were purified by anion exchange and hydrophobic chromatography, and their N-terminal amino-acid sequences, molecular mass and isoelectric points were determined. All three proteins are glycosylated and their N-glycan chromatographic profiles show the largest contribution of neutral oligosaccharides in crocodile and disialylated glycans in python ovotransferrin. The absorption spectra of iron-saturated transferrins were analysed. Iron release from these proteins is pH-dependent, showing a biphasic character in crocodile ovotransferrins and a monophasic type in the python protein. The reason for the different types of iron release is discussed.",Acta biochimica Polonica,"['D000489', 'D000818', 'D017821', 'D003207', 'D004531', 'D005260', 'D006706']","['Alligators and Crocodiles', 'Animals', 'Boidae', 'Conalbumin', 'Eggs', 'Female', 'Homeostasis']",Isolation and characterisation of crocodile and python ovotransferrins.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17351671,2007

The release curves of some aroma compounds-some of them generated during baking and others added in the dough-were followed by cumulative headspace analysis. In the flavored SC-b, the aroma release curves showed a plateau after 15 min of purge, while the release increased proportionally with the purge time in the flavored SC-e. In general, except for some of the aroma compounds with the highest log P values, the rate of release of most of the added and generated aroma compounds was significantly influenced by the changes in the cake formulation.

17222840,"Despite their abundance and their enormous significance for various ecological processes, endocrine systems of microcrustaceans have been poorly investigated. Here, we used a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) to determine free and conjugated ecdysteroid levels in whole-body extracts of adult Daphnia magna during a complete molt cycle. Ecdysteroid levels were predominated by free ecdysteroids. Starting from basal levels in the postmolt stage the concentration of free ecdysteroids increased sharply in the early premolt stage, followed by a sharp decline back to basal levels just prior to ecdysis. Polar and apolar ecdysteroid conjugates were found in rather low amounts with little variation during the molt cycle. Only small amounts of ecdysteroids were found in newly deposited eggs of D. magna, which suggest a sparing investment of maternal ecdysteroids into the eggs for early embryogenesis. As in whole-body extracts, free ecdysteroids were the predominant ecdysteroids found in eggs of D. magna, together with small amounts of polar and intermediary amounts of apolar conjugates. Hence, the pathways leading to polar and apolar ecdysteroid conjugates appear to be of minor importance in D. magna. Analyses of the immunodetectable peak in free ecdysteroids by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed that molting is induced most probably by an increased level of 20-hydroxyecdysone. Microcrustaceans of the genus Daphnia are key components in freshwater food webs.

17189915,"A new method for visualizing small and multiple phosvitins (Pvs) in oocytes from a marine teleost was developed by a combination of gel filtration, alkaline phosphatase treatment, and SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Three distinct Pv polypeptides having molecular masses of 15 kDa, 8 kDa, and 7 kDa were visualized in vitellogenic follicle extract of barfin flounder, Verasper moseri. N-terminal amino acid sequencing identified two different N-termini that fell into the PvA (7 kDa) and PvB (15 kDa and 8 kDa) groups, which were derived from two forms of vitellogenin (Vg), VgA and VgB, respectively. Analysis of time-course change in phosphorus-rich peaks of gel chromatography fractions of follicle extracts from different maturational stages demonstrated a rapid degradation of Pvs during mid-phase of oocyte maturation. Quantitative analysis of free amino acids in maturing follicles revealed an increment of serine content but not of phosphoserine, indicating the occurrence of dephosphorylation concomitant with Pv degradation. Measurement of phosphatase activity in follicles and eggs at different maturational stages demonstrated a significant activation of phosphatase especially under acidic conditions. This suggested that Pv degradation and dephosphorylation are regulated by changes in ooplasm pH during oocyte maturation. Our results also suggested that the Pvs in barfin flounder vitellogenic oocytes bind to much lower amounts of calcium and magnesium than those of masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou.

17164214,"Nitrofuran antibiotics have been banned for use in food-producing animals in many countries, including the European Union, owing to the threat they pose to human health. Research continues into the accumulation of these drugs in animal tissues and into the appropriate methods for their detection. In this study, an LC-MS/MS method is presented for the detection of the parent compounds, furazolidone, nitrofurantoin, furaltadone and nitrofurazone, in eggs. The parent compounds are first extracted into ethyl acetate, fats are removed by partition between acetonitrile and hexane, and the concentrated sample is analysed by LC-MS/MS. Decision limits (CCalpha) for the parents were < or =1 microg kg-1 for all four compounds. Within-day and between-day CVs are well within the limits stated in Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The method provides an alternative to the testing of side-chain metabolites in eggs, which is particularly important in the case of nitrofurazone, where semicarbazide contamination of food has been attributed to sources other than nitrofurazone use. This method was used together with a method for the detection of the side-chain metabolite compounds, 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ), 3-amino-5-morpholinomethyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one (AMOZ), 1-amino-hydantoin (AHD) and semicarbazide (SEM), to study the accumulation and distribution of nitrofurans in eggs. Eggs were collected from four groups of hens that had been treated with one of the nitrofurans at a feed concentration of 300 mg kg-1 for 1 week. Parent compounds and metabolites were found in the yolk, albumen and shell. Albumen/yolk ratios for the parent compounds were 0.7, 0.82, 0.83 and 0.31 for furazolidone, furaltadone, nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone, respectively. Ratios for the side-chain metabolites were 1.02, 1.06, 0.83 and 0.55 for AOZ, AMOZ, AHD and SEM, respectively. However, 50% of the total SEM residues were found in eggshell.

Lower-quality feeds given to chickens may be contaminated with T-2 toxin, which may affect their health. The literature suggests that T-2 toxin is transmitted from the hen to the eggs. This article describes the development of a liquid chromatographic assay for T-2 and the related mycotoxin HT-2 in eggs. T-2 and HT-2 toxins were isolated from spiked eggs with a tandem charcoal-alumina-Florisil column and immunoaffinity column cleanup. The isolated toxins were derivatized with the fluorophore 1-anthroyl nitrile, separated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and quantitated by fluorescence. The limit of detection of the method was 1 ng ml(-1) (parts per billion) of T-2 and HT-2 in whole (with shell removed) eggs. The limit of quantitation for both toxins was 5 ng ml(-1). Recoveries from spiked eggs over the range from 5 to 50 ng ml(-1) averaged 89.2% for T-2 and 100.3% for HT-2, with coefficients of variation of 3.5 and 8.2%, respectively.

Methods This paper analysed the effect of cooking on the retinol levels of free-range and caged hen eggs, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The retinol levels of hen and quail eggs were also compared. Results The raw egg yolk retinol concentrations of free-range and caged hen eggs were 476.53+/-39.44 and 474.93+/-41.10 microg/100 g and cooked egg yolk concentrations were 393.53+/-24.74 and 379.01+/-30.78 microg/100 g, respectively; quail egg concentration was 636.56+/-32.71 microg retinol/100 g. No significant difference was found between the retinol of free-range and caged hen egg yolks; however, cooking diminished retinol levels, causing a loss of 17 and 20% in the free-range and caged hen egg yolks, respectively. Quail egg retinol concentration was significantly higher than that of the hens.

Development of a simple and sensitive method for the determination of SAs residues in food of animal origin, therefore, is of great significance. An on-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) method using multiwalled carbon nanotubes as sorbent coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for simultaneous determination of 10 sulfonamides (SAs) in eggs and pork was developed. The adsorptive potential of carbon nanotubes for solid-phase extraction of sulfonamides was investigated for the first time in the present paper. To on-line interface solid-phase extraction with HPLC, a conventional sample loop on the six-port injector valve of the HPLC was replaced by a preconcentration column packed with carbon nanotubes. The analytes in water solution were preconcentrated onto the preconcentration column and subsequently eluted with mobile phase of methanol-water (22:78). The developed on-line solid-phase extraction method for HPLC permitted the current HPLC separation and the next preconcentration proceeded in parallel, and thus allows one determination finished within 35 min.

In particular, the Xenopus system has been extensively employed not only as a ""living cell"" system but also as a ""cell-free"" or ""reconstitutional"" system. In this chapter, we describe a protocol for studying the molecular mechanism of egg fertilization with the use of cell-free extracts and membrane/lipid rafts prepared from unfertilized, metaphase II-arrested Xenopus eggs. By using this experimental system, we have reconstituted a series of signal transduction events associated with egg fertilization, such as sperm-egg membrane interaction, activation of Src tyrosine kinase and phospholipase Cgamma, production of inositol trisphosphate, transient calcium release, and cell cycle transition. This type of reconstitutional system may allow us to perform focused proteomics (e.g., rafts) as well as global protein analysis (i.e., whole egg proteome) of fertilization in a cell-free manner. As one of these proteomics approaches, we provide a protocol for molecular identification of Xenopus egg raft proteins using mass spectrometry and database mining.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","['D000818', 'D019556', 'D002457', 'D002474', 'D002522', 'D005260', 'D005306', 'D008297', 'D021962', 'D040901', 'D029867', 'D014982']","['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell-Free System', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Male', 'Membrane Microdomains', 'Proteomics', 'Xenopus Proteins', 'Xenopus laevis']",Studying fertilization in cell-free extracts: focusing on membrane/lipid raft functions and proteomics.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16739739,2006

Two kinds of ELISA kits have been provided as screening test kits for the Japanese official method. The kits have many advantages but some disadvantages, i.e., the kits are not necessarily suitable for daily monitoring in food manufacturing plants, because they require various analytical equipments and the use of complicated procedures. To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed other diagnostic kits based on immunochromatography that should enable more rapid and simple screening for food allergens. Then we examined the performance of these immunochromatographic test kits (IC kits) in terms of sensitivity, repeatability and cross-reactivity to AS proteins in 11 kinds of food models with various heating conditions and physical properties. We also examined processed food models including AS protein of constant concentration, using the IC kits and ELISA kits, and compared the results. The IC kits detected AS proteins at 5 microg/g in the extracts from processed food models, and provided highly reproducible results. Cross-reactivity among the AS proteins was not observed. The results obtained using the IC kits showed performance equivalent to that of the ELISA kits we examined in unheating processed food models including AS proteins of constant concentration.

Following addition of d5-chloramphenicol as internal standard, meat, seafood, egg, honey and milk samples were extracted with acetonitrile. Chloroform was then added to remove water. After evaporation, the residues were reconstituted in methanol/water (3+4) before injection. The urine and plasma samples were after addition of internal standard applied to a Chem Elut extraction cartridge, eluted with ethyl acetate, and hexane washed. Also these samples were reconstituted in methanol/water (3+4) after evaporation. By using an MRM acquisition method in negative ionization mode, the transitions 321-->152, 321-->194 and 326-->157 were used for quantification, confirmation and internal standard, respectively. Quantification of chloramphenicol positive samples regardless of matrix could be achieved with a common water based calibration curve. The validation of the method was based on EU-decision 2002/657 and different ways of calculating CCalpha and CCbeta were evaluated.

The purpose of this study was to establish appropriate sample collection methodology to monitor these contaminants in sea turtle eggs. Contaminant concentrations were measured in yolk samples from eggs that failed to hatch from three loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nests collected in southern Florida to determine if concentrations change through embryonic development. One to three egg yolk samples per nest were analyzed from early, middle, and late developmental stages (n=22 eggs total). PCB and pesticide concentrations were determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). Geometric mean concentrations of summation operatorPCBs (52 congeners), summation operatorDDTs, summation operatorchlordanes, and dieldrin in all eggs were 65.0 (range=7.11 to 3930 ng/g lipid), 67.1 (range=7.88 to 1340 ng/g lipid), 37.0 (range=4.04 to 685 ng/g lipid), and 11.1 ng/g lipid (range=1.69 to 44.0 ng/g lipid), respectively. Early and middle developmental stage samples had similar concentrations of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides on a wet-mass basis (ng/g tissue extracted), but the concentrations doubled by the late stage. This increase is most likely attributable to the 50% increase in lipid content observed in the late-stage yolk. These findings indicate that an early-stage sample cannot be directly compared to a late-stage sample, especially from different nests. These preliminary findings also allowed us to calculate the minimum number of eggs per nest required for analysis to obtain an acceptable mean concentration per nest.

Using matrix-assisted, laser desorption-ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the peptide yielded a protonated molecular ion [M + H]+ of m/z 2789. The unequivocal sequence was deduced by automated Edman degradation as: DLWNSIKDMAAAAGRAALNAVTGMVNQ. The peptide exhibited an 80.76% identity with dermaseptin 3.1 from the leaf frog Agalychnis annae, and was therefore named Schistosoma mansoni dermaseptin-like peptide (SmDLP). Immunocytochemical staining using a primary antidermaseptin B2 antibody located SmDLP in acetabular glands of cercariae, in and around schistosomula, and in adult worms and their eggs. Dot-blotting confirmed its presence in extracts (cercariae and worms) and excretion/secretion (E/S) products (transforming cercariae and eggs). This was corroborated by use of a MALDI-ToF spectra database of E/S products from cercariae. Functional characterization of the peptide indicated that SmDLP had typical amphipathic antimicrobial peptide properties, i.e., the ability to lyse human erythrocytes causing a decrease in the levels of nitric oxide produced by monocytic cells.

Hg concentrations (wet mass) ranged from 0.011 microg/g to 0.357 microg/g (relative standard deviation = 76%), while conspecifics from the same colonies and years had an average relative standard deviation of 33%. Hg levels in eggs from the Gulf of Alaska (0.166 microg/g +/- 0.011 microg/g) were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than in the Bering Sea (0.047 microg/g +/- 0.004 microg/g). Within the Bering Sea, Hg was significantly higher (p = 0.0007) in eggs from Little Diomede Island near the arctic than at the two more southern colonies. Although thick-billed and common murres are ecologicallysimilar,there were significant species differences in egg Hg concentrations within each region (p < 0.0001). In the Bering Sea, eggs from thick-billed murres had higher Hg concentrations than eggs from common murres, while in the Gulf of Alaska, common murre eggs had higher concentrations than those of thick-billed murres. A separate one-way analysis of variance on the only time-trend data currently available for a colony (St. Lazaria Island in the Gulf of Alaska) found significantly lower Hg concentrations in common murre eggs collected in 2001 compared to 1999 (p = 0.017). Results from this study indicate that murre eggs may be effective monitoring units for detecting geographic, species, and temporal patterns of Hg contamination in marine food webs. The relatively small intracolony variation in egg Hg levels and the ability to consistently obtain adequate sample sizes both within and among colonies over a large geographic range means that monitoring efforts using murre eggs will have suitable statistical power for detecting environmental patterns of Hg contamination. The potential influences of trophic effects, physical transport patterns, and biogeochemical processes on these monitoring efforts are discussed, and future plans to investigate the sources of the observed variability are presented.",Environmental science & technology,"['D000413', 'D000818', 'D046091', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D005260', 'D005843', 'D008628', 'D010063', 'D015203', 'D012098', 'D014018']","['Alaska', 'Animals', 'Charadriiformes', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Female', 'Geography', 'Mercury', 'Ovum', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reproduction', 'Tissue Distribution']",Murre eggs (Uria aalge and Uria lomvia) as indicators of mercury contamination in the Alaskan marine environment.,"[None, None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'physiology', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16509300,2006
16488491,"Pesticide pulses in the Sacramento River, California, originate from storm-water discharges and non-point source aquatic pollution that can last from a few days to weeks. The Sacramento River and its tributaries have historically supported the majority of California's Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning grounds. Three pesticides currently used in the Sacramento Valley-- dinoseb, diazinon, and esfenvalerate-- were chosen to model the exposure of salmon embryos to storm-water discharges. Static-renewal (96 h) exposures to eyed eggs and alevins resulted in both toxicity and significant changes in metabolism assessed in whole-embryo extracts by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy based metabolomics and HPLC with UV detection (HPLC-UV). The 96-h LC(50) values of eyed eggs and alevins exposed to dinoseb were 335 and 70.6 ppb, respectively, and the corresponding values for diazinon were 545 and 29.5 ppm for eyed eggs and alevins, respectively. The 96-h LC(50) of eyed eggs exposed to esfenvalerate could not be determined due to lack of mortality at the highest exposure concentration, but in alevins was 16.7 ppb. All esfenvalerate exposed alevins developed some degree of lordosis or myoskeletal abnormality and did not respond to stimulus or exhibit normal swimming behavior. ATP concentrations measured by HPLC-UV decreased significantly in eyed eggs due to 250 ppb dinoseb and 10 and 100 ppb esfenvalerate (p < 0.05). Phosphocreatine, as measured by HPLC-UV, decreased significantly in eyed eggs due to 250 ppb dinoseb, 10 and 100 ppb esfenvalerate, and 100 ppm diazinon (p < 0.05). Principal components analyses of (1)H NMR metabolite fingerprints of eyed egg and alevin extracts revealed both dose-dependent and mechanism of action-specific metabolic effects induced by the pesticides. Furthermore, NMR based metabolomics proved to be more sensitive than HPLC-UV in identifying significant changes in sublethal metabolism of pesticide exposed alevins. In conclusion, we have demonstrated several benefits of a metabolomics approach for chemical risk assessment, when used in conjunction with a fish embryo assay, and have identified significant metabolic perturbations to the early life stages of Chinook salmon by currently used pesticides.","Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D019297', 'D000244', 'D000255', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D002851', 'D003976', 'D004625', 'D007928', 'D008141', 'D009682', 'D009570', 'D010575', 'D010725', 'D025341', 'D011722', 'D018570', 'D012474', 'D014874']","['2,4-Dinitrophenol', 'Adenosine Diphosphate', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diazinon', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Lordosis', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Nitriles', 'Pesticides', 'Phosphocreatine', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Pyrethrins', 'Risk Assessment', 'Salmon', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']","Metabolic effects of dinoseb, diazinon and esfenvalerate in eyed eggs and alevins of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) determined by 1H NMR metabolomics.","['Q000031', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000662', 'Q000633', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000139', 'Q000379', 'Q000633', 'Q000633', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000633', 'Q000379', 'Q000196', 'Q000633']","['analogs & derivatives', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'veterinary', 'toxicity', 'drug effects', None, 'chemically induced', 'methods', 'toxicity', 'toxicity', 'analysis', None, 'toxicity', 'methods', 'embryology', 'toxicity']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16488491,2007

The results showed that the test heavy metals could be detected at high levels in the eggshell, egg contents, and tissues of most samples. Eggshell and bone were the two main sites for heavy metals enrichment. Eggshell had significantly higher residues of the heavy metals than egg contents, implying that heavy metals could be excreted by eggshells. The residues of heavy metals in eggshell ranked as Cr > Pb > Cd, and had significant differences among species. Of the three heavy metals, Cr showed the most variation among species, being the highest in eggshell of Chinese pond heron and the lowest in that of cattle egret, but in egg contents, there was no significant difference among species. The variation of Cr residues among species was the second, being the highest in the egg contents of Chinese pond heron but not detected in that of cattle egret.

16331840,"Although the function of ornamental traits in males has been the focus of intensive research for decades, expression of such traits in females has received much less study. Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) display structurally based ultraviolet/blue and melanin-based chestnut plumage, and in males this plumage coloration is related to both reproductive success and competitive ability. Compared to males, female bluebirds show a subdued expression of blue and chestnut ornamental coloration, and we used a combination of an aviary nutritional-stress experiment and four years of field data to test the hypothesis that coloration functions as a signal of female quality. First, we tested the effect of food intake on expression of structural and melanin coloration in female eastern bluebirds to determine whether structural or melanin coloration are condition-dependent traits. Females that were given ad libitum access to food displayed more ornamented structural coloration than females on a food-restricted diet, but there was no effect of the experiment on melanin ornamentation. Second, we used field data to assess whether female ornamentation correlated with measures of mate quality and parental effort. The structural coloration of females predicted first egg date, maternal provisioning rates, and measures of reproductive success. These data indicate that structural coloration is dependent on nutritional condition and suggest that sexual selection is acting on structurally based plumage coloration in female eastern bluebirds.",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,"['D000367', 'D000407', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D001824', 'D004435', 'D005241', 'D005260', 'D005298', 'D008543', 'D046109', 'D010858', 'D025341', 'D012098', 'D012641', 'D012727', 'D012737', 'D012726', 'D013053']","['Age Factors', 'Alabama', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Body Constitution', 'Eating', 'Feathers', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Melanins', 'Passeriformes', 'Pigmentation', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Reproduction', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Factors', 'Sexual Behavior, Animal', 'Spectrophotometry']",Evidence for sexual selection on structural plumage coloration in female eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis).,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000378', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000502', None, None, None, 'Q000502', None]","[None, None, None, None, 'physiology', 'physiology', 'physiology', None, 'physiology', 'metabolism', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'physiology', None, None, None, 'physiology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16331840,2006

Monitoring potential perchlorate contamination in the environment is of interest, however, very few analytical methods have been developed for perchlorate determination in biological samples. Analysis of complex samples by ion chromatography is complicated by matrix components that can interfere with perchlorate determination. However, a recently developed preconcentration/preelution (PC/PE) ion chromatography method has demonstrated the capability to analyze certain complex samples such as high salinity water, milk, and hydroponic fertilizers. The ability of this method to reduce sample background and lower detection limits in ion chromatography for various biological samples was evaluated in this study. The PC/PE method was applicable to the analysis of kidneys, livers, zebrafish, quail eggs, lettuce, and urine. Optimal operating conditions were determined for each matrix. Ranges of optimal wash volumes were shorter when 15 mM NaOH prewash solutions were used compared with 10mM and good recovery was achieved for most matrices with an injection period > or =60s.

VTG induction was found in male cod caught in the North Sea, the Shetland Box area, in Oslofjord and also in cultivated fish. There was a strong relationship between concentrations of VTG and fish size. There was no evidence that the presence of VTG in the plasma of males is a natural part of their life cycle. On the other hand, the size of fish at which these elevated VTG concentrations appear (ca. 5 kg) is about the size that cod change from feeding primarily on benthic invertebrates to mainly other fish, both benthic and pelagic.

HCB and DDTs were prevalent contaminants in penguin eggs. The highest concentrations of SigmaHCHs (1.35 +/- 0.72 ng/g) were found in the rockcod muscle, where gamma-HCH (1.23 +/- 0.67 ng/g) was the principal isomer. The ratio gamma-HCH/alpha-HCH was evaluated. Enantioselective gas chromatography was used for the evaluation of enantiomeric fractions (EFs) for alpha-HCH and oxychlordane. An increase of 14% in the (+)alpha-HCH enantiomer was found from krill through penguin, suggesting the enantioselective biotransformation increased proportionately with trophic level. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were measured and their concentrations were 5.6 +/- 1.12, 5.81 +/- 2.32, 4.57 +/- 0.17 and 3.06 +/- 3.27 ng/g lipids in krill, rockcod muscle, rockcod homogenate and penguin eggs, respectively.

16157586,"The rainbow trout egg vitelline envelope (VE) is constructed of three proteins, called VEalpha,VEbeta, and VEgamma, that are synthesized and secreted by the liver and transported in the bloodstream to the ovary, the site of VE assembly around eggs. All three proteins possess an N-terminal signal peptide, a zona pellucida domain, a consensus furin-like cleavage site (CFLCS) close to the C terminus, and a short propeptide downstream of the CFLCS. Proteolytic processing at the CFLCS results in loss of the short C-terminal propeptide from precursor proteins and enables incorporation of mature proteins into the VE. Here mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with a micromass-quadrupole TOF hybrid mass and a QSTAR Pulsar i mass spectrometer) was employed with VE proteins isolated from rainbow trout eggs in a peptidomics-based approach to determine the following: 1) the C-terminal amino acid of mature, proteolytically processed VE proteins; 2) the cellular site of proteolytic processing at the CFLCS of VE precursor proteins; and 3) the relationship between proteolytic processing and limited covalent cross-linking of VE proteins. Peptides derived from the C-terminal region were found for all three VE proteins isolated from eggs, indicating that processing at the CFLCS occurs after the arrival of VE precursor proteins at the egg. Consistent with this conclusion, peptides containing an intact CFLCS were also found for all three VE proteins isolated from eggs. Furthermore, peptides derived from the C-terminal propeptides of VE protein heterodimers VEalpha-VEgamma and VEbeta-VEgamma were found, suggesting that a small amount of VE protein can be covalently cross-linked on eggs prior to proteolytic processing at the CFLCS.

16156083,"Quinolone antibacterials are veterinary drugs authorized for use in food animal production. The analysis of residual amounts of drugs in food from animal origin is important for quality control of products for consumers. For this purpose, Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) have been set up by a European Union Council Regulation on Veterinary Drug Residues (No. 90/2377/EEC and subsequent), and 8 quinolones received MRLs at concentration levels depending on both the matrix and the animal species of interest. A method was developed for screening and confirming 10 quinolone residues (ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, difloxacin, enrofloxacin, flumequine, marbofloxacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, oxolinic acid, sarafloxacin) in a wide variety of matrixes of different animal species. It involves extraction of the residues from the biological tissues/fluids by acidic aqueous solution, centrifugation and filtration prior to injection on a C18 narrow-bore column, and detection through a 3-step-mode fluorescence detector. The method was validated during a 2-week study for a set of 8 species-matrixes (i.e., bovine raw milk, bovine muscle, porcine muscle, porcine kidney, porcine liver, fish flesh and skin, poultry muscle, whole egg). Residues were quantified down to 15 microg/kg with limits of detection and quantitation ranging from 4 to 11 and 13 to 36 microg/kg, respectively, which are sufficient compared to the wide range of MRLs set for these substances (from 30 microg/kg for danofloxacin in milk to 1900 microg/kg for difloxacin in poultry liver). The limit of performance of the method in terms of CCalpha and CCbeta, the critical concentrations stated in the Decision No. 2002/657/EC and the ISO Standard No. 11843, has been calculated for the authorized (MRL) substances but only estimated in the case of the nonauthorized (non-MRL) substances.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D000818', 'D000890', 'D002138', 'D002498', 'D002845', 'D002853', 'D002939', 'D004350', 'D000077422', 'D005399', 'D024841', 'D005504', 'D007668', 'D008460', 'D009268', 'D009643', 'D010093', 'D015363', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D013552', 'D013997']","['Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Calibration', 'Centrifugation', 'Chromatography', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Drug Residues', 'Enrofloxacin', 'Fishes', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Food Analysis', 'Kidney', 'Meat', 'Nalidixic Acid', 'Norfloxacin', 'Oxolinic Acid', 'Quinolones', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Swine', 'Time Factors']",Multiresidue method for simultaneous determination of ten quinolone antibacterial residues in multimatrix/multispecies animal tissues by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection: single laboratory validation study.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000031', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'methods', None, 'analogs & derivatives', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16156083,2005

Levels of formaldehyde (FA), acetaldehyde (AA) and PET oligomers in various PET food packaging were determined. PET samples were initially dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to derivatize formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to their dinitrophenylhydrazones. The stable derivatives along with the oligomers were analysed using HPLC with ultraviolet light detection at 360 and 254 nm, respectively. The PET pellets contained 3.5-12.4 microg g-1 AA and 4.0-7.2 mg g-1 oligomers, while FA was below the determination limit. FA, AA and oligomer levels in Japanese bottles were 0.6-3.0 microg g-1, 8.4-25.7 microg g-1 and 5.0-8.7 mg g-1, ND-1.6 microg g-1, 5.0-13.1 microg g-1 and 4.9-8.2 mg g-1 in French and Italian bottles, and ND-1.2 microg g-1, 9.1-18.7 microg g-1 and 5.6-8.0 mg g-1 in US and Canadian bottles, respectively.

In sheet-moulding products, their contents were determined as ND-1.1 microg g-1, 11.5-43.1 microg g-1 and 4.6-9.2 mg g-1, respectively. The results show that sheet-moulding products contain lower FA and higher AA in comparison with bottles. FA and AA are considered to be generated from PET during the heating process for moulding the pellets to bottles or sheet-moulding articles and de-aeration during the sheet-moulding process is effective in removing FA.

For the analysis, multidimensional high-resolution gas chromatography using a chiral column coated with randomly silylated heptakis(O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-beta-cyclodextrin, electron capture detection, and valveless ""live column switching"" technique was applied. The analytical results were additionally confirmed with mass spectral data, recorded in electron-capture negative ionization mode with selected-ion monitoring mass spectrometry. During both the feeding period of the laying hens with toxaphene-contaminated food (38 weeks, accumulation phase) and the following subsiding period without toxaphenes (another 14 weeks, decontamination phase), organs (liver, kidney, skin/fat), blood, meat, and eggs of the hens served as model matrices for toxaphene uptake. The enantiomeric ratios (ERs) of congeners 26, 31, 32, 40, 41, 42(a+b), 44, 50, and 62--known as the most important components of technical toxaphene occurring in the environment--could be analytically determined. Significant differences were observed with respect to their initial racemic ratios. On the basis of their chemical structures, the metabolic pathways of some congeners could be explained. Astonishingly, some of the toxaphenes applied as racemates could merely be found as single enantiomers at the end of the feeding program, for example, congener 32 in blood and meat samples or congener 44, especially in organ tissues, which showed ERs of zero or infinity.

Mercury concentration was highest among the toxic elements in egg content of both the two species. In some egg contents of black-footed albatrosses, Hg concentrations were higher than the threshold level that may cause decreased hatchability and aberrant nesting behavior in some avian species. Concentrations of Cd in egg content and Ba in egg content and shell increased with an increase in egg breadth/length ratio, whereas Hg in egg content showed an opposite trend in black-footed albatrosses. Since egg breadth/length ratio is known to increase with the age of mother bird, this result may imply that concentrations of these elements in eggs vary with age of mother bird.

The PCB levels (calculated as the sum of all the determined congeners) were found to be the highest (from 56.8 to 47909.5 ng/g on lipid basis), followed by the DDTs (sum of p,p'-DDT and its metabolites; <dl-2095.5 ng/g) and HCB (<dl-165.4 ng/g). There were marked differences in residue levels of DDTs and PCBs among the various species under investigation (from P<0.05 to P<0.001). Since the presence of organochlorine pollutants was most evident in the strictly resident species which inhabit shallow coastal waters, contamination of the Gulf of Naples by these compounds probably derives from local agricultural, industrial, and municipal sources. Concentrations of DDTs and PCBs detected in this study were generally comparable or higher than those found in studies of similar species from other Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean regions subject to a high anthropogenic impact. From the human health point of view, the residue levels of HCB and DDTs detected in this study are well below the Maximum Residue Limits for some foods of animal origin (0.2 and 1 mg/kg fat weight for HCB and DDTs calculated as the sum of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, and o,p'-DDT, respectively).

15859091,"Two rapid methods of sample preparation and analysis of fatty foods (e.g., milk, eggs, and avocado) were evaluated and compared for 32 pesticide residues representing a wide range of physicochemical properties. One method, dubbed the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method for pesticide residue analysis, entailed extraction of 15 g sample with 15 mL acetonitrile (MeCN) containing 1% acetic acid followed by addition of 6 g anhydrous magnesium sulfate and 1.5 g sodium acetate. After centrifugation, 1 mL of the buffered MeCN extract underwent a cleanup step (in a technique known as dispersive solid-phase extraction) using 50 mg each of C18 and primary secondary amine sorbents plus 150 mg MgSO4. The second method incorporated a form of matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD), in which 0.5 g sample plus 2 g C18 and 2 g anhydrous sodium sulfate was mixed in a mortar and pestle and added above a 2 g Florisil column on a vacuum manifold. Then, 5 x 2 mL MeCN was used to elute the pesticide analytes from the sample into a collection tube, and the extract was concentrated to 0.5 mL by evaporation. Extracts in both methods were analyzed concurrently by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The recoveries of semi-polar and polar pesticides were typically 100% in both methods (except that basic pesticides, such as thiabendazole and imazalil, were not recovered in the MSPD method), but recovery of nonpolar pesticides decreased as fat content of the sample increased.

15514471,"Resting eggs of Daphnia, a key crustacean zooplankton of freshwater food chains, can remain viable for more than a century. These eggs are able to withstand freezing and drying, and can survive the harsh environment of a predator's digestive system. Until recently little was known about the chemical composition, microanatomy, and physical properties of the resting eggs. The current study utilized a physical technique, the X-ray analytical microscope, to identify and localize component elements of the Daphnia resting egg. The analysis demonstrated that phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, and calcium were detected as elemental components of the resting egg, and detection intensities of the four elements differed according to the position of the eggs. Phosphorus and calcium were mostly detected in regions of the eggshell that surrounded the two embryos. In addition, sulfur was distributed throughout the eggshell whereas potassium was localized to the areas that corresponded to where the embryos were encased.

Specimens of samples from raptors are useful for the investigation of the impact of PGEs because these birds are found in both urban and rural environments and are invariably at the top of the food chain. Platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh) concentrations were determined by quadrupole Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) in eggs of the sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), and in blood, liver and kidney of the peregrine falcon, while only Pt was determined in faeces of the peregrine falcon and the gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus). PGE concentrations were higher in blood compared to both faeces and eggs, while liver and kidney concentrations were not elevated indicating no bioaccumulation through metallothionein pathways. A significant spatial trend could only be established for Pt in faeces. The general lack of a spatial trend is probably due to the widespread distribution of automobiles and the long-range transport of nanoparticles containing PGEs, and because birds migrate and forage over large areas. No significant temporal trend could be established.

15479230,"We reported previously that the major cysteine protease in embryos and larvae of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a catalytic subunit (28.5 kDa) with a high degree of homology with cathepsin L, and a noncatalytic subunit (31.5 kDa) of unknown function. In the study reported here the noncatalytic subunit, or cathepsin L-associated protein (CLAP), was separated from cathepsin L by chromatography on Mono S and found to contain multiple isoforms with pIs ranging from 5.9 to 6.1. Heterodimeric and monomeric cathepsin L showed similar activity between pH 5 and 6.5, while the heterodimer was about twice as active as monomeric cathepsin L below pH 5. The heterodimer was more stable than the monomer between pH 6 and 7.4 and at 30-50 degrees C. Artemia CLAP and cathepsin L are present in nearly equimolar amounts at all stages in the life cycle and most abundant in encysted eggs and embyros. Moreover, CLAP, either free or as a complex with cathepsin L, was resistant to hydrolysis by cathepsin L. Two clones coding for CLAP were isolated from an Artemia embryo cDNA library and sequenced. Both clones have nearly identical open reading frames, but show differences at the 5'- and 3'-termini. Each cDNA clone has an extensive 3'-untranslated region containing 70-72% A+T. The deduced amino acid sequence of CLAP cDNA revealed two domains which were very similar to domains in fasciclin I and other cell adhesion proteins. The nucleotide sequences of clones 1 and 2 have been entered into the NCBI database (AY307377 and AY462276). This study supports the view that the noncatalytic subunit of the heterodimeric cysteine protease in Artemia stabilizes cathepsin L at various pH and temperatures normally inconsistent with cathepsin L from other organisms, and that CLAP serves as a docking mechanism for cathepsin L at nonlysosomal sites in Artemia embryos.",European journal of biochemistry,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D001156', 'D001483', 'D020134', 'D056668', 'D002403', 'D015816', 'D017124', 'D003546', 'D018076', 'D019281', 'D029721', 'D004591', 'D004625', 'D006863', 'D007525', 'D007527', 'D008969', 'D017434', 'D021122', 'D013696']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Artemia', 'Base Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cathepsin L', 'Cathepsins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dimerization', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Isoenzymes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Subunits', 'Temperature']",Characterization of a cathepsin L-associated protein in Artemia and its relationship to the FAS-I family of cell adhesion proteins.,"[None, None, 'Q000196', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000235', 'Q000737', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000201', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'embryology', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'genetics', 'chemistry', 'genetics', None, 'chemistry', None, 'enzymology', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15479230,2005

The distribution of external versus internal metal contamination of feathers was investigated. The species examined were peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), sparrowhawk ( Accipiter nisus), willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus), and house sparrow (Passer domesticus) in Sweden. For habitat comparisons, total Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd concentrations were analyzed by ICP-MS in feathers of the examined species as well as captive peregrine falcon. For investigation of metal distribution and correlation in different biological materials of raptors, total concentrations of Cu, Pb, Cd, and Zn were also investigated by ICP-MS in feathers, eggs, blood, feces, liver, and kidney of wild peregrine falcon from southwestern Sweden. Laser ablation of feathers revealed that Pb contamination is both external and internal, Zn contamination is internal, and Cd and Cu contamination is predominantly internal, with a few externally attached particles of high concentration. Pb, Cu, and Cd signal intensities were highest in urban habitats and contamination was mainly external in feathers. The background signal intensity of Zn was also higher in birds from urban habitats. The laser ablation profile of PGE (Pt, Pd, Rh) demonstrated that PGE contamination of feathers consists almost exclusively of externally attached PGE-containing particles, with little evidence of internally deposited PGE.Generally, total metal concentrations in feathers were highest in sparrowhawk and house sparrow due to their urban habitat. Total Cu, Zn, and Cd concentrations were highest in liver and kidney due to binding to metallothionein, while the total Pb concentration was highest in feces due to the high excretion rate of Pb.

Four groups of laying hens (eight in each group) were fed a diet that included differing amounts of naturally contaminated wheat containing DON ( approximately 20 mg kg(-1)) and ZON (0.5 mg kg(-1)). Eggs were collected and pooled from each group on a daily basis. Pooled samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS). The method allowed DON, other type B trichothecenes, ZON, and its metabolites to be determined in a single multi-residue analysis. The selectivity of the MS/MS procedure allowed cleanup to be minimized (for DON, cleanup by immunoaffinity column was used) or eliminated (for ZON). The limits of detection of 0.01 microg kg(-1) for DON and 0.1 microg kg(-1) for ZON in eggs were lower than previously published methods. None of the samples analyzed had detectable levels of ZON or its metabolites. Although maximum levels of DON contamination (10 mg kg(-1) feed) were relatively high, no adverse effects were observed on egg production.

The results indicate that concentrations of Pb and Cd were highly increased in the order of eggs < chicks < adults. In food analysis, supplementary foods (rice, small stones, domestic scraps, cements, hairs, Styrofoam, etc.) could be considered as factors considering the Pb concentration differences. Concentrations of Cd in foodstuffs, the proportion of crop contents as their major foods could have an influence on the difference of Cd levels from a nutritional viewpoint.

15182189,"The extracellular coat, or vitelline envelope (VE), of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs consists of three proteins, called VEalpha (M(r) approximately 52 kDa), VEbeta (M(r) approximately 48 kDa), and VEgamma (M(r) approximately 44 kDa). Each of these proteins is related to mammalian egg zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins ZP1-3 and possesses an N-terminal signal sequence, a ZP domain, and a protease cleavage site near the C-terminus. VEalpha and VEbeta also have a trefoil domain. All three proteins possess a relatively large number of cysteine residues (VEalpha, 18; VEbeta, 18; VEgamma, 12), of which 8 are present in the ZP domain and 6 are present in the trefoil domain of VEalpha and VEbeta. Here, several types of mass spectrometry were employed, together with gel electrophoresis of chemical and enzymatic digests, to identify intramolecular disulfide linkages, as well as the N- and C-terminal amino acids of VEalpha, VEbeta, and VEgamma. Additionally, these methods were used to characterize two high molecular weight proteins (HMWPs; M(r) > 110 kDa) of rainbow trout VEs that are heterodimers of individual VE proteins. These analyses have permitted assignment of disulfide linkages and identification of N- and C-terminal amino acids for the VE proteins and determination of the protein composition of two forms of HMWPs.

The experiments were conducted on leaves of Close and Jester apple cultivars in laboratory conditions. Leaves were treated with: 1. solution of 0.1% JA-Me in 0.05% Triton X-100 (by spraying); 2. beta-glucosidase dissolved in 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 6 (by petiole); 3. 0.05% solution of the Triton X-100 (by spraying); 4. 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 6 (by petiole); 5. non-treated leaves. In the no-choice test, application of JA-Me on leaves of apple trees caused reducing of number of eggs laid up during three days of the experiment. In the choice test, which was carried out for determination of non-preference mechanism of resistance, there was not significant differences between number of mites on leaves treated with JA-Me compared to leaves treated with beta-glucosidase, and to non-treated leaves after 24 hours from solutions application. However, at the same experiment, females of T. urticae laid the least number of eggs on leaves treated with JA-Me. Analysis conducted using liquid chromatography method, revealed higher level of phenolic compounds on leaves treated with JA-Me compared to check and leaves treated with beta-glucosidase.

The system was found to be more effective against the organism in vegetable juices than in animal products, at low pH than at neutral pH, and at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures. Acid-adapted S. enteritidis cells were more susceptible than nonadapted cells. The system reduced numbers of S. enteritidis in vegetable products by up to 5.4 log units and inhibited growth of the organism in animal-derived foods during 4 h incubation at 30 degrees C. Sodium chloride (>100 mM) and polyphosphate (0.01-0.5%) enhanced the antibacterial effects of the system in tomato juice and chicken skin extract, respectively.

To date, it has been difficult to determine whether these compounds are natural products or derived from industrial synthesis. Molecular-level 14C analysis of these compounds is particularly appealing because most industrial compounds are manufactured from petrochemicals (14C-free) and natural compounds should have ""modern"" or ""contemporary"" 14C levels. To investigate the source of DBP-Br4Cl2, we isolated 600 microg of this compound (150 microg of carbon) from marine animal extracts by employing gel permeation chromatography, Florisil column chromatography, and two-dimensional preparative capillary gas chromatography. The purified DBP-Br4Cl2 was split into two samples (75 microg of carbon each) and analyzed by accelerator mass spectrometry for 14C content. The delta14C values were -449 percent per thousand and -467 percent per thousand, corresponding to conventional 14C ages of 4740 and 5000 years before present (BP), respectively. The presence of detectable 14C in the DBP-Br4Cl2 strongly points to at least a natural or biogenic source.

15106678,"Few studies have described the organochlorine (OC) contaminant concentrations found in sea turtle tissues. These studies have relied on the opportunistic sampling of either eggs or tissues from stranded carcasses. In this study, the use of whole blood samples as well as both blood components (plasma and red blood cells) were examined as a non-destructive alternative for monitoring OCs in free-ranging loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). Blood samples were collected from juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (n = 12) captured in Core Sound, North Carolina, USA and analyzed for 55 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 24 OC pesticides by gas chromatography with electron capture detection and mass spectrometry. Using pooled loggerhead sea turtle whole blood, three different liquid:liquid extraction techniques were compared. Results were similar in terms of recovery of internal standards, lipids, and OC concentrations. An extraction technique, employing formic acid and 1:1 methyl-tert-butyl-ether: hexane, was found to be satisfactory. This method was applied to the extraction of OCs from whole blood, plasma, and red blood cell (RBC) samples from five loggerhead sea turtles. Plasma contained the highest OC concentrations on a wet mass basis, followed by whole blood and RBCs. The majority of each OC compound was found in the plasma rather than the RBCs, suggesting that OC compounds preferentially partition into the plasma. On average (SD), 89.4% (3.1 %) of total PCBs, 83.4% (11.9%) of total chlordanes, 74.3% (15.1%) of mirex, 72.6% (4.8%) of total DDTs, and 80.1% (16.6%) of dieldrin were found in the plasma. The concentrations of total PCBs, mirex, total chlordanes, and total DDTs measured in both components of the blood significantly correlated to those in whole blood. These are the first reported OC concentrations in sea turtle blood. They were found to be similar to previously reported levels in blood components of humans and of reptiles from relatively clean sites, but lower than those measured in blood of fish-eating birds and marine mammals.

Hg levels were below those found in other raptors with reduced reproductive success. No correlation was found between Hg and Se levels.

20437390,"Sulfonamides represent a wide range of synthetic compounds commonly used in veterinary therapy for the treatment of several bacterial and protozoan infections in cattle, swine and poultry. Trimethoprim is another antibacterial agent mainly used in fish culture and often combined with sulfonamides in commercial preparations. Residues of these drugs in foodstuffs are of concern because of their potential carcinogenic character. Consequently, the European Union (EU) and United States Food and Drug Administration set maximum residue limits for both sulfonamides (100 microg/kg either as a single molecule or as a sum of all detected compounds within the class) and trimethoprim (TMP) (50 microg and 100 microg/kg, according to the matrix) in chicken, fish muscle and eggs.On the other hand, these limits have made of concern the development of confirmatory methods for the analysis of these molecules. LC-MS/MS technique, in particular, resulted fit for the detection of these medium polarity compounds. An effective multi-residue method is presented for the simultaneous determination of certain sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline) and TMP in products of animal origin (chicken muscle, fish muscle and eggs) by liquid chromatographymass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) at levels in compliance with the legislation in force. The drugs were extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane/acetone (1:1, v/v) and clean-up was carried out by solid phase extraction (SPE) on a sulfonic acid column after addition of acetic acid to the extract, so as to allow for ionexchange. Sulfonamides and TMP were then eluted from the SPE column using a solution of ammonia in methanol. The chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column by using a mobile phase of methanol/5 mM aqueous ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid in gradient, and the LC-MS/MS analysis was performed in a triplequadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a TurboIonSpray source and operated in positive ion mode. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) approach was adopted for the identification and quantification of the molecules of concern and was applied by selecting three specific diagnostic ions (one precursor ion and two product ions) for each analyte, so as to meet the criteria set by the EU both for the minimum required number of identification points and for the ion intensity ratio tolerances. Calculated detection limits for sulfonamides (signal/noise ratio 3:1) ranged from 0.1 microg to 1.7 microg/kg, whereas the recovery rates varied between 69.5% and 94.2% throughout the different compounds and matrices. The corresponding values for TMP ranged from 0.2 microg to 0.4 microg/kg and between 51.9% and 52.8%, according to the matrix. The easy sample preparation procedure and the specific and selective mass spectrometric detection make the present method reliable and suitable for the unambiguous identification and quantitation of the analytes taken into account in chicken, fish muscle and eggs. Moreover, method application has successfully extended to other sulfonamides, such as sulfaguanidine, sulfapyridine, sulfamoxole and sulfamethizole.",Veterinaria italiana,[],[],"Determination of some sulfonamides and trimethoprim in chicken, fish muscle and eggs by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20437390,2012

14718505,"The egg attachment system of an estuarine crab Sesarma haematocheir is formed on the maternal ovigerous hairs just after egg laying, and slips off these hairs just after hatching. The stripping is caused by an active factor that we call OHSS (ovigerous-hair stripping substance), which is released by the embryo upon hatching. OHSS was purified, and its active form had a molecular mass of 25 kDa. The cDNA of OHSS cloned from an embryonic cDNA library was 1759 bp long, encoding 492 amino acids in a single open reading frame (ORF). The C-terminal part of the predicted protein was composed of a trypsin-like serine protease domain, with homology to counterparts in other animals of 33-38%. The predicted protein (54.7 kDa) secreted as a zymogen may be cleaved post-translationally, separating the C-terminal from the N-terminal region. The OHSS gene was expressed in the embryo at least 2 weeks before hatching. Expression was also detected in the zoea larva 1 day after hatching and in the brain of the female. However, it was not detected in the muscle, hepatopancreas or ovigerous seta of the female. Ultrastructural analysis indicated that the material investing maternal ovigerous hair, i.e. the outermost layer (E1) of the egg case, is attached at the special sites (attachment sites) arranged at intervals of 130-160 nm on the hair.

Smaller areas of Laos and Cambodia were also sprayed with Agent Orange between 1962 and 1971 from fixed-wing aircraft. In 2001, 28 food samples consisting of meat, fish, and dairy products were collected in sprayed and nonsprayed areas of Laos and analyzed for dioxins, dioxinlike dibenzofurans, and selected polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry at laboratories in Germany and Canada. Low levels of dioxin and other dioxinlike substances were found in Laotian food, similar to levels present in recent exported Vietnamese food to United States. Vietnam is geographically adjacent to Laos. Total dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) levels were similar in samples from sprayed and non-sprayed areas, ranging from 0.009 to 0.851 pg/g or parts per trillion (ppt) in sprayed Sepone, and from 0.022 to 0.537 pg/g or ppt wet weight in non sprayed Vientiane.

The authors found strong, positive correlations between the levels of metals in the feeds and the corresponding levels of metals in the eggs. The overall average concentrations (mg/kg) of each metal in eggs were as follows: lead, 0.59; cadmium, 0.07; copper, 0.78; iron, 23.20; nickel, 0.03; zinc, 13.75; and cobalt, 0.01. The average estimated daily intake of lead, cadmium, copper, and iron per person was 19.5 microg, 2.4 microg, 25.6 microg, and 762.3 microg, respectively, whereas daily intakes of nickel, zinc, and cobalt were 0.9 microg, 452.1 microg, and 0.2 microg per person. The concentrations of some metals in eggs from this study did not differ appreciably from levels determined in eggs from other countries; concentrations of lead and cadmium in the current study, however, were comparatively greater than levels found in other countries.

14579413,"The possible role of metallothionein (MT) in metal homeostasis has been investigated in growing oocytes and eggs of the lizard Podarcis sicula. Chromatographic analysis does not reveal the presence of MT in both ovary and eggs, the only metal-binding proteins detected being represented by high molecular mass components. De novo synthesis of MT could be observed in the ovary of cadmium-treated lizards. A cDNA encoding MT was obtained from the liver of P. sicula by RT-PCR followed by a RACE strategy, using primers designed on consensus motifs of vertebrate MT. In spite of the lack of MT in the ovary of untreated animals, Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the maternal untranslated MT transcript is expressed constitutively in the ovary in all the periods of the ovarian cycle. MT mRNA content increases during the oocyte growth, reaching the highest level in ovulated eggs, concomitantly with the accumulation of zinc and copper. Our findings suggest that maternal MT mRNA accumulates in the egg and is translated sometime during development to cope with the future needs of the growing embryo.

The protein binds to a Sepharose 4B matrix and can be eluted with 0.4 M N -acetylglucosamine. The protein has an apparent molecular mass of 26686.3 Da. On the basis of gel-filtration chromatography, the protein appears to be present in solution as a monomer. The sequence of its 238 amino acids, the position of its four disulphide bridges and the composition of its single N-linked carbohydrate chain were determined. The lectin shows a very low agglutinating activity for human A-type erythrocytes and interacts with both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. These latter interactions are inhibited by N -acetylglucosamine. A database search shows that its amino acid sequence is similar to that of the members of an invertebrate lectin family that includes tachylectin-1. Tachylectin-1 is present in the amoebocytes of the horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus, and plays a role in the innate defence system of this species.

12850094,"In this paper, we review the available data for polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and other flame retardants in wildlife, with the exception of fishes from Europe and North America which are covered in more detail elsewhere. More data are available for PBDEs than for other compounds, and these show that some of these compounds have become widely distributed in the environment, being found in samples from Europe, Australia, Azerbaijan, North America and the Arctic. Most available data relate to birds and their eggs and marine mammals, but the results of two food web studies are also included. The detection of PBDEs in pelagic marine mammals which feed in deep offshore waters, including baleen whales, indicate that these compounds have found their way into deep-water, oceanic food webs as well as the coastal/shallow sea examples described in detail. In the North Sea study, the most marked increase in lipid-normalised concentrations of six BDE congeners occurred during transfer from predatory fish to marine mammals. In the St. Lawrence Estuary study, marked differences in the ratios observed between species suggested that some fish species may be able to metabolise BDE99.A number of time trend studies have also been conducted, notably in guillemot eggs from Sweden (1969-2000), beluga whales from the Canadian Arctic (1982-1997 and 1989-2001) and from the St. Lawrence Estuary (1988-1999), and ringed seals from the Canadian Arctic (1981-2000). In the temperate latitudes, from these and other studies (e.g. in dated sediment cores), PBDE concentrations began to rise earlier than in those from high latitudes, in line with data for production and use. These trends have now slowed in many cases. Declines could be expected in Europe for many congeners following the cessation of manufacture and use of the penta-mix formulation in the EU, though these are not yet apparent in environmental samples. In Arctic biota, however, the rapidly rising concentrations seen currently in Canada could be expected to continue for some time, reflecting continued production and use of the penta-mix formulation in North America (>95% of the world total) and the impact of long-range atmospheric transport.",Environment international,"['D000818', 'D000835', 'D005060', 'D005411', 'D020387', 'D008401', 'D006842', 'D009656', 'D009792', 'D010647']","['Animals', 'Animals, Wild', 'Europe', 'Flame Retardants', 'Food Chain', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrocarbons, Brominated', 'North America', 'Oceans and Seas', 'Phenyl Ethers']",Levels and trends of polybrominated diphenylethers and other brominated flame retardants in wildlife.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000633', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'toxicity', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12850094,2003

12831013,"Concentrations of polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) were measured in foodstuffs randomly acquired in seven cities of Catalonia, Spain. A total of 108 samples, belonging to 11 food groups (vegetables, tubers, fruits, cereals, pulses, fish and shellfish, meat and meat products, eggs, milk, dairy products, and oils and fats), were analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). The levels of tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and hepta-CNs, those of octachloronaphthalene, and the mean sum concentration of tetra-octa-CN were determined. The highest concentration of total PCNs was found in oils and fats (447 pg/g), followed by cereals (71 pg/g), fish and shellfish (39 pg/g), and dairy products (36 pg/g). In general, tetra-CN was the predominant homologue in all food groups except for fruits and pulses, which had greater proportions of hexa-CNs. The dietary intake of total PCNs was subsequently determined. For calculations, recent data on consumption of the selected food items were used. Intake of PCNs was estimated for five population groups of Catalonia: children, adolescents, male and female adults, and seniors.

12782108,"Through human activity lead has become a serious environmental neurotoxin, known to affect activity levels, attention and both sensory and cognitive function in children. Study of lead would be facilitated by having a model system that could be manipulated easily and quickly. We find Drosophila melanogaster ideal as such, and we have been studying effects of lead on courtship, fecundity and locomotor activity. We raised Canton-S flies from eggs to adult day 6-7 on medium made with lead acetate solution (2-100 microgram/g), or with distilled water, and we measured adult body lead burdens by means of Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). To measure courtship effectiveness, five virgin females and five virgin males were transferred into an empty vial and the number of females that mated within 20min was recorded. To measure fecundity, all adult offspring from eggs produced by one female within 12 days of mating were counted. To measure locomotor activity, individual flies were transferred to a grid-labeled petri dish and the number of lines crossed in 30s was counted. The number of females mating within 20min was increased significantly by exposure to 2 or 8 microgram/g lead, and was decreased significantly by exposure to 20 or 50 microgram/g lead. Fecundity was increased significantly by exposure to 2 microgram/g lead, but was unaffected by exposure to 20 microgram/g lead. Locomotor activity was consistently higher for males than for females, and was significantly reduced only by exposure to 50 microgram/g lead, and then only for males. We thus defined for Drosophila a lowest observable effect level (LOEL) of 2 microgram/g lead, which is considerably lower than the doses shown previously to affect this animal. The dose-response curve was biphasic for the number of females mating within 20min, an example of hormesis, a non-linear response that has been reported for low levels of stressors as diverse as pollutants and radiation. We hope from further studies with Drosophila to understand better how lead affects the developing nervous system, and thus ultimately its effects on children.",Neurotoxicology,"['D000818', 'D004305', 'D004331', 'D004781', 'D005260', 'D008297', 'D009043', 'D009942', 'D012726']","['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Male', 'Motor Activity', 'Organometallic Compounds', 'Sexual Behavior, Animal']",Behavioral effects of chronic exposure to low levels of lead in Drosophila melanogaster.,"[None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000706', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000008', 'Q000187']","[None, None, 'drug effects', 'statistics & numerical data', None, None, 'drug effects', 'administration & dosage', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12782108,2003
12730414,"Choline is important for normal membrane function, acetylcholine synthesis and methyl group metabolism; the choline requirement for humans is 550 mg/d for men (Adequate Intake). Betaine, a choline derivative, is important because of its role in the donation of methyl groups to homocysteine to form methionine. In tissues and foods, there are multiple choline compounds that contribute to total choline concentration (choline, glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin). In this study, we collected representative food samples and analyzed the choline concentration of 145 common foods using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Foods with the highest total choline concentration (mg/100 g) were: beef liver (418), chicken liver (290), eggs (251), wheat germ (152), bacon (125), dried soybeans (116) and pork (103). The foods with the highest betaine concentration (mg/100 g) were: wheat bran (1339), wheat germ (1241), spinach (645), pretzels (237), shrimp (218) and wheat bread (201).

12654293,"Selected for its high relative abundance, a protein spot of MW approximately 75 kDa, pI 5.5 was cored from a Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gel of proteins from 2850 zona-free metaphase II mouse eggs and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (TMS), and novel microsequences were identified that indicated a previously uncharacterized egg protein. A 2.4-kb cDNA was then amplified from a mouse ovarian adapter-ligated cDNA library by RACE-PCR, and a unique 2043-bp open reading frame was defined encoding a 681-amino-acid protein. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the nonredundant database demonstrated that the protein was approximately 40% identical to the calcium-dependent peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) enzyme family. Northern blotting, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization analyses indicated that the protein was abundantly expressed in the ovary, weakly expressed in the testis, and absent from other tissues. Based on the homology with PADs and its oocyte-abundant expression pattern, the protein was designated ePAD, for egg and embryo-abundant peptidylarginine deiminase-like protein. Anti-recombinant ePAD monospecific antibodies localized the molecule to the cytoplasm of oocytes in primordial, primary, secondary, and Graafian follicles in ovarian sections, while no other ovarian cell type was stained. ePAD was also expressed in the immature oocyte, mature egg, and through the blastocyst stage of embryonic development, where expression levels began to decrease. Immunoelectron microscopy localized ePAD to egg cytoplasmic sheets, a unique keratin-containing intermediate filament structure found only in mammalian eggs and in early embryos, and known to undergo reorganization at critical stages of development.

Three sequential 3-tonne batches of nicarbazin-free feed were produced directly after a batch of nicarbazin-containing feed (125 mg kg(-1)). Sampling of the nicarbazin-free feed took place at two points before pelleting and at one point post-pelleting. The study was repeated on two further occasions, i.e. three separate nicarbazin-containing feeds and 27 tonnes of 'flushing' feeds were manufactured and sampled in total. Pre-pelleting, the highest nicarbazin concentrations (3.4+/- 0.26 mg kg(-1)) were observed in the first tonne milled after the nicarbazin containing ration. Thereafter, concentrations steadily declined in successive batches. Post-pelleting samples contained much higher concentrations of the drug. After 8 tonnes had passed through, the concentrations (7.2+/- 1.29 mg kg(-1)) were between 10 and 20 times greater than the corresponding concentrations detected post-mixing. These concentrations are sufficient to cause violative residues in eggs and broiler liver.

The method was performed at low contamination levels, which represent relevant contents in food, and is an extension of the European standard (method NF-EN-1528, Parts 1-4). It enlarges the applicable scope of the reference EN method to pyrethroid pesticides and proposes the use of solid-phase extraction (SPE) as a cleanup procedure. Cryogenic extraction was made, and SPE cleanup was performed with 2 successive SPE cartridges: C18 and Florisil. After injection of the purified extract onto a GC column, residues were measured by electron capture detection. Food samples (liquid milk, beef fat, mixed fish, and mixed eggs) were prepared, tested for homogeneity, and sent to 17 laboratories in France. Test portions were spiked with 27 pesticides and 7 PCBs at levels from 26 to 45, 4 to 27, 31 to 67, and 19 to 127 ng/g into milk, eggs, fish, and fat, respectively. Based on results for spiked samples, the relative standard deviation for repeatability ranged from 1.5 to 6.8% in milk, 3 to 39% in eggs, 4.5 to 12.2% in fish, and 7 to 13% in fat.

12399916,"The effect of contamination on eggshell mineralization has been studied for clapper rails (Rallus longirostris) inhabiting a contaminated salt marsh in coastal Georgia. To assess the impact of contaminants, the thickness, microstructure (crystal orientation), mineral composition, and chemistry of shell material were analyzed from a contaminated site and a nearby reference site using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography with electron capture detector. Eggshells from the contaminated site were generally thinner than those from the reference site. Also, eggshells from the contaminated site were abnormally brittle and contained anomalous microstructural attributes. The combination of reduced shell thickness and anomalous microstructure resulted in weaker eggshells, which in turn could pose a significant threat to the reproductive success of the affected population.PCB concentrations in eggshells were at background levels in both sites. Eggshells from the contaminated site had higher concentrations of heavy metals, specifically mercury, than the reference site. The structural changes observed in eggshells may be related to the concentration of specific metals ( e.g., Mg, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Hg) in shell, however, statistical analyses indicated that metals only explained a small portion of the observed variation in properties ( i.e., thickness, crystal orientation).

CAP residues were determined by capillary gas chromatography (GC) with electron capture detection (ECD) using meta-CAP as an internal standard (ISTD). Before chromatographic determination, analytes were derivatized by silylation. Overall, CAP recovery, adjusted for ISTD, was for bovine muscle tissue and raw cow's milk (in the region of 2-10 microg kg(-1)) 89 and 102%, respectively, and for whole eggs, 87% (in the region of 1-10 microg kg(-1)). The use of meta-CAP improved significantly the precision of the method. The detection limit for CAP was 1 microg kg(-1), which was sufficiently sensitive for routine use.

As confirmed by further investigations the precaecal digestibility is a valuable measure for determining the availability of native B-vitamins. Therefore, pigs were fitted with an end-to-end ileo-rectal anastomosis for digesta passing straight from ileum to rectum, thus avoiding endogenous vitamin synthesis by the colon. Three weeks after surgery the digestibility experiments were carried out during which the animals were fed various experimental diets for a period of 12 days and digesta were collected quantitatively twice a day during the final 5 days of this period. The concentration of vitamin B6 in foods and chyme was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography.

11838290,"Indoxacarb is a new oxadiazine insecticide that has shown outstanding field insecticidal activity. The toxicity of a 145 g litre-1 indoxacarb SC formulation (Steward) was studied on the tarnished plant bug Lygus lineolaris and the big-eyed bug Geocoris punctipes. Both insect species responded very similarly to indoxacarb in topical, tarsal contact and plant feeding toxicity studies. The topical LD50 of the formulation was c 35 ng AI per insect for both species. Prolonged tarsal contact with dry indoxacarb residues did not result in mortality for either insect species. However, both species were susceptible to feeding through dried residues of indoxacarb after spraying on young cotton plants. Feeding on water-washed plants resulted in lower mortality than that observed with unwashed plants, and toxicity declined even more dramatically after a, detergent rinse, indicating that much of the indoxacarb probably resides on the cotton leaf surface or in the waxy cuticle. These results were corroborated by HPLC-mass spectrometry measurements of indoxacarb residues on the plants. Greater mortality for both species was observed in a higher relative humidity environment. Higher levels of accumulated indoxacarb and its active metabolite were detected in dead G punctipes than in L lineolaris after feeding on sprayed, unwashed plants. When female G punctipes ate indoxacarb-treated Heliothis zea eggs, there was significant toxicity. However, only c 15% of the females consumed indoxacarb-treated eggs, and the rest of the females showed a significant diminution of feeding in response to the insecticide. Cotton field studies have shown that indoxacarb treatments at labelled rates lead to a dramatic decline in L lineolaris, with negligible declines in beneficial populations. A major route of intoxication of L lineolaris in indoxacarb-treated cotton fields thus appears to be via oral, and not cuticular, uptake of residues from treated cotton plants.

Retinal (RAL1) or both RAL1 and 3,4-didehydroretinal (RAL2) were major or exclusive retinoids in the eggs of every species examined. In O. keta eggs, both RAL1 and RAL2 were present at the ratio of approximately 3:4, whereas RAL1 was the only retinal in the eggs of the other three marine species. RAL1 was the exclusive retinoid in the eggs of P. yokohamae and I. japonicus, whose eggs lack lipid bodies. In the eggs of O. keta and A. schlegeli, which have lipid bodies, retinylesters were also detected, and retinals composed 69% and 93%, respectively, of total retinoids. In O. keta eggs, retinals were present mostly in the aqueous part and were bound to a protein homologous to lipovitellin 1, an amphibian yolk protein, and retinylesters were located in lipids. These results indicate that retinals are the essential mode of retinoid storage in eggs of teleosts and they are the precursors of functional retinoids, such as retinoic acid and visual pigment chromophores.

The essence of this paper is to demonstrate that one single method can serve very well for two entirely different purposes, i.e., screening and confirmation. Highly reliable confirmation of the identity at low concentrations was demonstrated when residues of narasin were detected and quantified (0.2 to 11 ng g(-1)) in 50% of the Swedish eggs analysed in 1999. Four daughter ions were detected with ion ratios meeting suggested confirmation criteria for the European Union, even at 0.2 ng g(-1). The method was found to be highly cost-effective since both screening and confirmation of 98 liver samples were performed in only two analytical runs (the Swedish national surveillance scheme of 1999, report level 5 ng g(-1)). The high performance of the method for the different applications was possible due to a combination of the power of ES-LC-MS-MS, a procedure involving screening of pooled samples, and method optimisation of the work-up (automated solid phase extraction), LC and MS parameters. Validation data for narasin (0.5 to 20 ng g(-1)) in eggs are presented (accuracy 94 to 108%, relative standard deviation 4 to 10%, limit of detection 0.026 ng g(-1)).

Purification of the enzyme involved precipitation of ovarian extracts by water and ammonium sulfate followed by five steps of column chromatography. After SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, the purified enzyme appeared as a single approximately 42 kDa band that was immunoreactive to anti-human cathepsin D. The course of proteolytic cleavage of the three major yolk proteins (lipovitellin, beta'-component, and phosvitin) in fertilized masu salmon and Sakhalin taimen (Hucho perryi) eggs and embryos was visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using specific antisera. Major yolk protein bands appeared in positions corresponding to 92 kDa, 68 kDa, and 22 kDa (lipovitellin-derived peptides), as well as 17 kDa (beta'-component). During embryo development, the 92 kDa and 22 kDa bands gradually decreased in intensity, becoming undetectable in alevins. The 68 kDa band and a minor 24 kDa band became more intense after the eyed stage. Two additional peptides, corresponding to 40 and 28 kDa, newly appeared in alevins. During embryonic growth, the beta'-component band (17 kDa) persisted and phosvitin appeared to be progressively dephosphorylated.

After a 4-day withdrawal from treatment, intact furazolidone could not be detected. AOZ residues could still be detected up to 21 days following withdrawal from treatment. During treatment, most intact furazolidone residues occur in the albumen. For AOZ, there is a more even distribution of residues between albumen and the yolk. The concentration of furazolidone in egg homogenates stored at -20 degrees C decreases by 44% after 55 days. AOZ residues are stable during this period.

11599993,"Direct sample introduction (DSI) or ""dirty sample injection"" is a rapid, rugged, and inexpensive approach to large volume injection in gas chromatography (GC) for semivolatile analytes such as pesticides. DSI of complex samples such as eggs requires a very selective detection technique, such as tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS), to determine the analytes among the many semivolatile matrix components that also appear. In DSI, the nonvolatile matrix components that normally would contaminate the GC system in traditional injection methods remain in a disposable microvial, which is removed after every injection. For example, 3 microg of nonvolatile residue typically remained in the microvial after an injection of egg extract using the DSI method. This analytical procedure involves the following: (i) weighing 10 g of egg in a centrifuge tube and adding 2 g of NaCl and 19.3 mL of acetonitrile (MeCN); (ii) blending for 1 min using a probe blender; (iii) centrifuging for 10 min; and (iv) analyzing 10 microL (5 mg of egg equivalent) of the extract using DSI/GC/MS-MS. No sample cleanup or solvent evaporation steps were required to achieve quantitative and confirmatory results with <10 ng/g detection limits for 25 of 43 tested pesticides from several chemical classes.

11441441,"Egg deposition of the elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola causes the emission of volatiles from its food plant, Ulmus minor. These volatiles are exploited by the egg parasitoid, Oomyzus gallerucae, to locate its host. In contrast to other tritrophic systems, the release of volatiles is not induced by feeding but by egg deposition. Previous investigations showed that the release is systemic and can be triggered by jasmonic acid. Comparison of headspace analysis revealed similarities in the blend of volatiles emitted following egg deposition and feeding. The mixture consists of more than 40 compounds; most of the substances are terpenoids. Leaves next to those carrying eggs emit fewer compounds. When treated with jasmonic acid, leaves emit a blend that consists almost exclusively of terpenoids. Dichloromethane extracts of leaves treated with jasmonic acid were also investigated. After separation of extracts of jasmonate induced elm leaves on silica, we obtained a fraction of terpenoid hydrocarbons that was attractive to the parasitoids.

11437464,"DDT contamination was investigated in soil, sediment, and chicken eggs from an endemic leishmaniasis area located in Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil. The last DDT application in this area was in 1990, for sand-fly vector control. Sampling campaigns were conducted in 1997 and 1999. DDT was extracted by use of a modified soxhlet apparatus and analysis was performed by gas chromatography with electron capture detector. The results show that, in 1997, soil samples contained up to 351 microg x kg(-1) x d x w. of summation operator DDT near the insecticide-sprayed sites. In 1999, the soil concentration decreased to 112 microg x kg(-1) x d x w. of summation operator DDT. Sediments from small creeks also showed low concentrations (up to 32.9 microg x kg(-1) x d x w. of summation operator DDT). Chicken eggs had, on average, 1.98 mg x kg(-1) summation operator DDT (twice FAO's maximum residue limit), comprising 82% of p,p'-DDE. Taking into account the egg results, DDT bioaccumulation is a question of concern. Considering just the egg consumption, it was estimated that DDT intake in the study area is 0.38x10(-4) mg x kg(-1) body weight x day(-1) whereas the reference maximum dose (US EPA) is 5x10(-4) mg x kg(-1) body weight x day(-1).

11422320,"Variability in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the two most prevalent Salmonella serotypes causing food-borne salmonellosis was assessed using gas chromatography analysis of neutral sugars from 43 Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) and 20 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) isolates. Four substantially different types of O-chain chemotypes were detected using cluster analysis of sugar compositions; these were low-molecular-mass (LMM) LPS, glucosylated LMM LPS, high-molecular-mass (HMM) LPS and glucosylated HMM LPS. Nineteen out of 20 S. Typhimurium isolates yielded glucosylated LMM. In contrast, S. Enteritidis produced a more diverse structure, which varied according to the source and history of the isolate: 45.5% of egg isolates yielded glucosylated HMM LPS; 100% of stored strains lacked glucosylation but retained chain length in some cases; and 83.3% of fresh isolates from the naturally infected house mouse Mus musculus produced glucosylated LMM LPS. A chain length determinant (wzz) mutant of S. Enteritidis produced a structure similar to that of S. Typhimurium and was used to define what constituted significant differences in structure using cluster analysis. Fine mapping of the S. Enteritidis chromosome by means of a two-restriction enzyme-ribotyping technique suggested that mouse isolates producing glucosylated LMM LPS were closely related to orally invasive strains obtained from eggs, and that stored strains were accumulating genetic changes that correlated with suppression of LPS O-chain glucosylation.

11417661,"The 2-alkylcyclobutanone method was adopted as a European Standard (EN1785) and MAFF Validated Method (MAFF V37) in 1996 for the detection of irradiated food containing fat. As the method requires a relatively long period (ca 2 days) of time for extraction of the 2-alkylcyclobutanones from a foodstuff, a means was sought to increase the speed at which these irradiation markers could be isolated while at the same time decreasing the amount of organic solvents required. Thus, the technique of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was investigated. Results showed that SFE can be used for the rapid extraction (60 min) of lipid from irradiated foods such as chicken, pork, liquid whole egg, ground beef, and from the seeds of irradiated mango and papaya with only 10 mL n-hexane being necessary for collection of the extracted sample. A method was also developed whereby the 2-alkylcyclobutanones can be selectively extracted from irradiated foods without prior extraction of the lipid. The sample extract, in 10 mL n-hexane, is purified through a Florisil SPE cartridge which is washed with 10 mL n-hexane and the 2-alkylcyclobutanones eluted with 10 mL 2% diethyl ether in n-hexane before analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 2-Dodecylcyclobutanone and 2-tetradecylcyclobutanone were selectively extracted from irradiated chicken meat, liquid whole egg, ground beef, and mango as well as from beef burgers and baked products containing irradiated ground beef and liquid whole egg, respectively.

In this observational study, the authors examined whether dietary tofu intake was associated with blood lead levels among young adults in Shenyang, China. The analyses included 605 men and 550 women who completed baseline questionnaires and had blood lead measurements taken in 1996-1998 as part of a prospective cohort study on reproductive health. Mean blood lead levels were 13.2 microg/dl in men and 10.1 microg/dl in women. Blood lead levels were negatively associated with tofu intake in both genders. A linear trend test showed a 3.7% (0.5-microg/dl) decrease in blood lead level with each higher category of tofu intake (p = 0.003). The highest tofu intake group (> or =750 g/week) had blood lead levels 11.3% lower (95% confidence interval: 4.1, 18.0) than those of the lowest tofu intake group (<250 g/week).

Samples of spray-dried whole egg, an Italian vanilla cake (Pandoro) and egg noodles were used. Two different extraction solvents (chloroform/methanol 2:1, v/v, and hexane/isopropanol 3:2, v/v) were tested at different extraction temperatures and pressures (60 degrees C at 15 MPa, 100 degrees C at 15 MPa, 120 degrees C at 20 MPa). No significant differences in the lipid recovery of the egg powder sample using PLE were found. However, PLE of the vanilla cake and egg noodles with the chloroform/methanol mixture was not selective enough and led to the extraction of a non-lipid fraction, including nitrogen-containing compounds. In the same samples, the pressurized hexane/isopropanol mixture gave a better recovery result, comparable to that obtained using the Folch method. Cholesterol oxidation products of the Folch extract and the pressurized liquid extract of spray dried egg powder (obtained with hexane/isopropanol 3:2, v/v, at 60 degrees C and 15 MPa) were determined by gas chromatography. PLE performed under these conditions is suitable to replace the Folch extraction, because the differences between the two methods tested were not statistically significant.

Nicarbazin, in the form of 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC), was detected in 39 of the 190 eggs analysed. An experiment was designed to establish the relationship between nicarbazin-contaminated feed and nicarbazin residues in eggs. The concentrations of both the DNC and 4,6-dimethyl-2-hydroxypyrimidine (DHP) components of the drug in eggs were proportional to feed levels. The maximum feed nicarbazin concentration of 12.1 mg/kg (8.6 mg/kg DNC and 3.5 mg/kg DHP) gave rise to mean maximum whole egg concentrations of 631 micrograms/kg DNC and 51.8 micrograms/kg DHP. After withdrawal of the experimental diet, DNC was undetectable in eggs after 12 days and DHP after 3 days. Feed contaminated with nicarbazin at concentrations greater than about 2 mg/kg gave rise to egg DNC residues at concentrations greater than the Differential Action Limit (DAL) set by the UK (100 micrograms/kg).

11090250,"In the second part of this study, emphasis is placed on nutritional intakes (fatty acids and micronutrients) and fatty acid intake and metabolism in the blood, respectively, according to a combined 24 h recall and standardized food frequency questionnaire analyses of keloid prone patients (n=10), compared with normal black South Africans (n=80), and total phospholipid blood (plasma and red blood cell ) analyses of keloid patients (n=20), compared with normal individuals (n=20). Lipid extraction and fractionation by standard procedures, total phospholipid (TPL) separation with thin layer chromatography, and fatty acid methyl ester analyses with gas liquid chromatography techniques were used. Since nutrition may play a role in several disease disorders, the purpose of this study was to confirm or refute a role for essential fatty acids (EFAs) in the hypothesis of keloid formations stated in part 1 of this study. (1)According to the Canadian recommendation (1991), we observed that in keloid patients linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA) dietary intakes, as EFAs of the omega-6-series, are higher than the recommended 7-11 g/d. However, the a-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dietary intakes, as EFAs of the omega-3 series, are lower than the recommendation of 1.1-1.5 g/d. This was also the case in the control group, where a higher dietary intake of the omega-6 fatty acids and a slightly lower dietary intake of the omega-3 fatty acids occurred. Thus, we confirm a high dietary intake of LA (as a product of organ meats, diary products and many vegetable oils) and AA (as a product of meats and egg yolks), as well as lower dietary intakes of ALA (as a product of grains, green leafy vegetables, soy oil, rapeseed oil and linseed), and EPA and DHA (as products of marine oils). Lower micronutrient intakes than the recommended dietary allowances were observed in the keloid group that may influence EFA metabolism and/or collagen synthesis. Of cardinal importance may be the lower intake of calcium in the keloid patients that may contribute to abnormal cell signal transduction in fibroblasts and consequent collagen overproduction, and the lower copper intake that may influence the immune system, or perhaps even the high magnesium intake that stimulates metabolic activity. Micronutrient deficiencies also occurred in the diets of the normal black South Africans that served as a control group. In the case of plasma TPLs, deficiency of the omega-3 EFA series (ALA, EPA and DHA) occurred, and this is in accordance with the apparent lower omega-3 EFA intake in the diets of these patients. In the case of the red blood cell TPLs, as a true and reliable source of dietary fatty acid intake and metabolism, sufficient EFAs of the omega-6 series (LA and AA) and the omega-3 series (ALA, EPA and DHA) occurred. For this study group a relative deficiency of nutritional omega-3 EFA intake apparently did occur, but was probably compensated for by blood fatty acid metabolism.","Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids","['D000293', 'D000328', 'D016718', 'D044383', 'D016022', 'D002855', 'D004032', 'D004281', 'D015118', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D007627', 'D019787', 'D008297', 'D010743', 'D012424', 'D015398', 'D013019', 'D011795']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Blacks', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Diet', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Keloid', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Male', 'Phospholipids', 'Rural Population', 'Signal Transduction', 'South Africa', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",Keloids in rural black South Africans.

Seven National Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference materials (SRMs) were analyzed to compare the recovery of 13 elements with above digestion procedures. The results demonstrated that the microwave digestion procedure with HNO3-H2O2-HF yielded the best recoveries for all 13 elements in the selected SRMs. The determined concentrations of most elements were close for all 3 microwave digestion procedures with the exception of Al in oyster tissue, bovine liver, and spinach.

10920350,"Many Salmo trutta populations consist of non-anadromous (freshwater-resident) brown trout and anadromous (sea-run migratory) sea trout. Although adult brown trout and sea trout can usually be identified using differences in size and body colouration, it is not possible to easily identify eggs/alevins as the progeny of brown trout or sea trout. In this study we show that delta(13)C and delta(15)N, measured using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS), can accurately identify fish eggs as the progeny of freshwater-resident (delta(13)C(egg) = -25.7 +/- 1.9 per thousand,delta(15)N(egg) = 9.2 +/- 1.8 per thousand) or migratory (delta(13)C(egg) = -19.9 +/- 1.1 per thousand, delta(15)N(egg) = 14. 3 +/- 1.5 per thousand) adult female Salmo trutta. Case studies show that stable isotope analysis is a more reliable technique for distinguishing anadromous adult fish than differentiation using morphological characteristics. For example, stable isotope analysis of brown trout from Loch Eck, Scotland, revealed that some individuals possessed delta(13)C and delta(15)N signatures indicative of marine feeding despite visual identification as freshwater-resident fish. It is most likely that these fish are misidentified sea trout although it possible that these fish may be brown trout that have adopted an estuarine feeding strategy to avoid interspecific competition for food within Loch Eck with salmon, powan and Arctic charr. Most stable isotope studies of fish ecology use terminal tissue sampling to provide sufficient biological material for isotopic analysis; however, our study suggests that adipose fin tissue could provide a comparable measure of delta(13)C and delta(15)N.

SRM 1846 Infant Formula was distributed as a quality control sample for the proximates and for analysis for individual fatty acids. Two of the materials (Whole Egg Powder and Whole Milk Powder) were distributed in an earlier interlaboratory comparison exercise in which they were analyzed for several vitamins. Value assignment of analyte concentrations in these 11 SRMs and RMs, based on analyses by the collaborating laboratories, is described in this paper. These materials are intended primarily for validation of analytical methods for the measurement of nutrients in foods of similar composition (based on AOAC INTERNATIONAL's fat-protein-carbohydrate triangle). They may also be used as ""primary control materials"" in the value assignment of in-house control materials of similar composition. The addition of proximate information for 10 existing reference materials means that RMs are now available from NIST with assigned values for proximates in 6 of the 9 sectors of the AOAC triangle.

Prior to HG-AAS, aliquots (250 to 320 mg) of dry samples were mineralized with 3 ml nitric acid and 0.5 ml of each sulfuric and perchloric acids in open digestion vessels made of glassy carbon in a heating block. Procedure detection and quantification limits of a previously developed procedure for the determination of Sb in plant materials by FI-HG-AAS were decreased with respect to the lower Sb concentrations in animal tissues, the sensitivity of the instrumental response was increased, and the composition of the acid digestion mixture was re-optimized for lipid-rich samples. The accuracy and precision of the developed procedure was evaluated by the analysis of the two reference materials Bovine Liver 1577a and Pig Kidney CRM 186. These reference materials have been additionally spiked with appropriate amounts of Sb to obtain recovery data. The solution detection limit (3 sigma) in digested samples was 0.021 microgram l-1, the detection limit for the whole procedure based on the dry powders was 7 pg g-1, the method quantification limit for a reliable determination of Sb was 23 pg g-1.

A three-phase surfactant-oil-water emulsion produced an advantageous flow when a peristaltic pump was used to introduce the highly viscous sample into the system. The optimum proportion of the oil-water mixture ratio was 2:3 v/v with a Tween 20 surfactant concentration in the emulsion of 0.008% v/v. Inorganic mercury was determined after reduction with sodium borohydride while total mercury was determined after an oxidation step with persulfate prior to the reduction step to elemental mercury with the same reducing agent.

10531555,"The developmental fate of the vitellogenin-derived yolk protein, lipovitellin (Lv), was investigated in winter flounder embryos and yolk-sac larvae. Since Lv is present as only one major polypeptide in ovulated winter flounder eggs, unlike the multiple yolk polypeptides found in the mature eggs of most teleosts, this system is presented as a simpler model of yolk protein structure and utilization during teleostean development. Winter flounder Lv is cleaved during embryogenesis from a 94 kD polypeptide at fertilization to 67 kD and 26 kD polypeptides at hatching. The rate of this proteolytic processing is slow during early embryonic development, but enters a more rapid phase between days 8 and 12 post-fertilization in embryos reared at 4-5 degrees C, and approaches 50% completion at day 10. Lv processing is essentially complete 3 days before hatching; nevertheless, major degradation of the Lv peptide by the developing winter flounder does not occur until after hatching. The Stokes radius of Lv changes only moderately following processing, from 4.50 nm in unfertilized eggs to 4.19 nm in late embryos and newly hatched larvae, whereas the processed Lv retains its heat stability relative to other yolk polypeptides. Nearly 50% of its lipid content, however, is released from the Lv particle during embryogenesis, concomitant with cleavage of the Lv 94 kD polypeptide. Lv processing may thus render a portion of the yolk protein-associated lipid more accessible to the developing embryo, whereas other yolk components are retained for later use by the winter flounder larva. Alternately, removal of lipid may lead to proteolytic vulnerability of the Lv polypeptide. In either case, only a portion of the lipid moiety of the Lv particle appears to play a significant nutritive role for the embryo, whereas its protein component is reserved for larval use. J. Exp.

Although not covered by the European Union (EU) maximum residue limit (MRL) for CTC, these compounds, taken together, accumulate in the eggs of birds treated therapeutically with CTC to a mean concentration equivalent to more than twice the EU MRL (200 micrograms kg-1) in eggs. Plateau concentrations in eggs were achieved after approximately 3 d of medication. Following withdrawal of medication, mean egg concentrations of these compounds were maintained for 48 h, before falling below a level equivalent to the MRL after 5 d. Feeds containing typical sub-therapeutic contamination concentrations of CTC did not produce mean concentrations of 6-iso-CTC plus 4-epi-6-iso-CTC, combined, greater than 200 micrograms kg-1. It is not known whether these compounds are formed as a result of metabolism or of chemical degradation. However, analysis of ovules pre-lay showed that all of the CTC present in this matrix was in the form of 6-iso-CTC and 4-epi-6-iso-CTC, and not as the parent drug.

10224019,"Twelve human and chicken isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis belonging to phage types 4, 8, 13a, and 23 were characterized for variability in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) composition. Isolates were differentiated into two groups, i.e., those that lacked immunoreactive O-chain, termed rough isolates, and those that had immunoreactive O-chain, termed smooth isolates. Isolates within these groups could be further differentiated by LPS compositional differences as detected by gel electrophoresis and gas liquid chromatography of samples extracted with water, which yielded significantly more LPS in comparison to phenol-chloroform extraction. The rough isolates were of two types, the O-antigen synthesis mutants and the O-antigen polymerization (wzy) mutants. Smooth isolates were also of two types, one producing low-molecular-weight (LMW) LPS and the other producing high-molecular-weight (HMW) LPS. To determine the genetic basis for the O-chain variability of the smooth isolates, we analyzed the effects of a null mutation in the O-chain length determinant gene, wzz (cld) of serovar Typhimurium. This mutation results in a loss of HMW LPS; however, the LMW LPS of this mutant was longer and more glucosylated than that from clinical isolates of serovar Enteritidis. Cluster analysis of these data and of those from two previously characterized isogenic strains of serovar Enteritidis that had different virulence attributes indicated that glucosylation of HMW LPS (via oafR function) is variable and results in two types of HMW structures, one that is highly glucosylated and one that is minimally glucosylated.

The mean concentration of 29 PCB-congeners (SigmaPCB) in the yolk sac was 1.22 microgram/g ww (wet weight basis) (SD = 0.57, n = 10), or 17.99 ng/g lw (lipid weight basis) (SD = 6.26, n = 10). Expressed as TCDD-equivalents (SigmaTEQ), the exposure in the yolk sac was 43.9 pg/g ww (SD = 19.5, n = 10), or 637.1 pg/g lw (SD = 240.8, n = 10), considerably lower than the levels that have been associated with clear-cut lethal and sublethal effects such as egg mortality, hatchability, or live deformity in Phalacrocoracidae species. There were significant negative correlations between SigmaPCB ww and the variables egg volume, yolk mass, and hatchling mass. We suggest that these relationships are passive causes of a higher lipid concentration in small eggs, rather than the PCB affecting the variables. Analyses showed that there was a borderline significant positive correlation between SigmaPCB lw in yolk and plasma retinol concentration. Although the results indicate that plasma retinol level alone is a poor indicator of PCB exposure in shag hatchlings, the result may be related to the low level of contaminant exposure and the low sample size of the study.",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D000818', 'D000831', 'D015415', 'D001717', 'D002849', 'D004530', 'D004784', 'D004787', 'D009664', 'D011078', 'D014801']","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Biomarkers', 'Birds', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Egg Yolk', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Norway', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Vitamin A']",Yolk PCB and plasma retinol concentrations in shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) hatchlings.,"[None, None, 'Q000097', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000097']","[None, None, 'blood', None, None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10047599,1999

Whitney rainbow trout strain were incubated at (12.5 degreesC) in Type 1 ASTM ultrapure grade water supplemented with boric acid (99.5% purity) during the 1995 and 1997 spawning seasons. Boron concentrations of the incubation solutions were determined by direct measurement using the curcumin procedure or inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.

The apparent molecular masses of purified STL1 and STL2 were estimated to be 84 and 68 kDa, respectively, by gel filtration chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry of these lectins revealed that STL1 was composed of noncovalently linked trimer of 31.4-kDa subunits, and STL2 was noncovalently linked trimer of 21.5-kDa subunits. The minimum concentrations of STL1, a major component, and STL2, a minor component, needed to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes were 9 and 0.2 microg/ml, respectively. The most effective saccharide in the hemagglutination inhibition assay for both STL1 and STL2 was L-rhamnose. Saccharides possessing the same configuration of hydroxyl groups at C2 and C4 as that in L-rhamnose, such as L-arabinose and D-galactose, also inhibited. The amino acid sequence of STL2 was determined by analysis of peptides generated by digestion of the S-carboxamidomethylated protein with Achromobacter protease I or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The STL2 subunit of 195 amino acid residues proved to have a unique polypeptide architecture; that is, it was composed of two tandemly repeated homologous domains (STL2-N and STL2-C) with 52% internal homology. These two domains showed a sequence homology to the subunit (105 amino acid residues) of D-galactoside-specific sea urchin (Anthocidaris crassispina) egg lectin (37% for STL2-N and 46% for STL2-C, respectively). The N terminus of the STL1 subunit was blocked with an acetyl group. However, a partial amino acid sequence of the subunit showed a sequence similarity to STL2. Moreover, STL2 also showed a sequence homology to the ligand binding domain of the vitellogenin receptor. We have also employed surface plasmon resonance biosensor methodology to investigate the interactions between STL2 and major egg yolk proteins from steelhead trout, lipovitellin, and beta'-component, which are known as vitellogenin digests. Interestingly, STL2 showed distinct interactions with both egg yolk proteins. The estimated values for the affinity constant (Ka) of STL2 to lipovitellin and beta' component were 3.44 x 10(6) and 4.99 x 10(6), respectively.

9443809,"Transglutaminase (TGase), responsible for crosslinking between proteins, is known to be localized exclusively in the egg envelope (chorion) of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and probably participates in the post-fertilization chorion hardening. We purified the TGase from unfertilized egg chorions by sequential chromatography using SP-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and TSK-gel G3000SWXL columns. The purified enzyme was a monomeric protein having the molecular mass of 76 kDa. It promoted incorporation of monodansyl-cadaverine into chorion protein and catalyzed the polymerization of chorion subunit proteins. The effect of various reagents suggested that the chorion TGase is a Ca2+-dependent SH-enzyme similar to the well-characterized TGases of various animals. The highest activity was observed at pH 6.0. The amines examined in the present study inhibited the TGase activity of the purified enzyme. However, they did not necessarily cause effective inhibition of its activity. These properties of the chorion TGase were essentially consistent with our previous observations on polymerization of chorion proteins, resulting in chorion hardening. We compared the amino acid composition of the purified TGase with those of the previously characterized TGases of fishes, such as chum salmon and red sea bream.

9399431,"A female-specific protein, vitellogenin (Vg), and its corresponding egg vitellin (Vn) were identified in the land crab Potamon potamios. Electrophoretic analysis of the hemolymph protein during the annual reproduction cycle revealed that the processing of vitellogenesis did not occur in males or in females of a previtellogenic stage. The analysis of ovarian and egg extracts revealed the presence of Vn, which was identical to Vg. Both Vg and Vn were present in three different aggregational states that represented monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric species of the proteins. In both proteins, the predominant form was the dimeric, which had a molecular mass of 551 kDa for Vg and 510 kDa for Vn. Under denaturing conditions, each of the individual Vg and Vn aggregates released three polypeptides with molecular masses of 115, 105, and 85 kDa. In spite of the difference in terms of native molecular mass, the Vg and Vn were similar in their lipid, carotenoid, and carbohydrate composition. However, Vg of some animals contained a fourth polypeptide with a molecular mass of 181 kDa. This polypeptide and the three other Vg and Vn polypeptides were immunoreactive against anti-Vg prepared from the 85 kDa Vg polypeptide. Furthermore, proteolytic cleavage experiments confirmed that the 115 and 105 kDa Vg polypeptides were derived from the 181 kDa polypeptide.

9322154,"The olfactory and accessory lobes constitute prominent histological structures within the larval and mature lobster deutocerebrum, and both are associated with a dense innervation from paired serotonergic nerve cells, the dorsal giant neurons (DGNs). During development, the cell bodies of the DGNs are the first central somata to express serotonin (5-HT), and the onset of their 5-HT immunoreactivity coincides with the beginning of accessory lobe formation. In contrast, the olfactory lobe anlagen emerge much earlier and grow in the apparent absence of serotonin. The role of serotonergic input for the development of these brain structures was investigated in lobster embryos after serotonin had been depleted pharmacologically with the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. A approximately 90% reduction of serotonin was confirmed in eggs using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Morphometric analyses suggested that serotonin depletion dramatically slowed the growth of olfactory and accessory lobes, although glomeruli differentiated at the normal time in both areas. The toxin exhibited a high degree of specificity for serotonergic neurons and associated target regions, and serotonin depletion persisted for at least 2 months following treatment.

The choice of foods, including beef, pork, poultry, game, fish, egg and sausages, was based on an investigation of an elderly population in Stockholm participating in an analytical epidemiological case-control study on cancer risks after intake of heterocyclic amines. The food items were prepared using normal household cooking practices, and to reflect the wide range of surface browning of the cooked dishes that would be encountered in this population, four cooking temperatures were used in the range 150-225 degrees C. For all food samples, the total amount of heterocyclic amines formed at 150 degrees C was less than 1 ng/g cooked product, and at 175 degrees C less than 2 ng/g. The highest concentrations of heterocyclic amines were detected in fillet of pork, reindeer meat and chicken breast fried at 200 and 225 degrees C and their corresponding pan residues. The total sum of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine was about 1 microgram per 100 g portion (including pan residues) for reindeer meat and chicken breast, and between 1.9 and 6.3 micrograms per 100-g portion for fillet of pork.

This MA is unique due to a high concentration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n-3) and the absence of other n-3 FA normally present in marine oils such as menhaden oil (MO). In the first experiment, 60 24-wk-old Single Comb White Leghorn (SCWL) hens were divided among four dietary treatments, including a typical corn-soybean control (CON); 1.5% MO, supplying 233 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 155 mg DHA per d; 2.4% MA, supplying 200 mg DHA/d; and 4.8% MA, supplying 400 mg DHA/d. A second experiment using 96 56-wk-old SCWL was conducted using the same diets. In both experiments, eggs were collected weekly for 4 wk for determination of egg production parameters and yolk FA content. Each week, yolk samples were extracted, methyl estered, and quantified using gas chromatography. Transient depression in egg and yolk weights were noted early in Experiment 1 in response to dietary 4.8% MA. Although egg and yolk weights were not affected in Experiment 2, egg production was significantly reduced in the 4.8% MA treatment. Egg production was unaffected due to diet or week in Experiment 1. In both experiments, yolk polyunsaturated profiles were significantly influenced by diet. Dietary n-3 FA supplementation significantly increased yolk total N-3 FA with concomitant reductions in yolk n-6 FA. Although hens fed MO were supplied predominantly EPA, the principal yolk FA deposited was DHA. Marine algae also promoted efficient yolk DHA deposition with the highest yolk DHA concentrations attained in eggs from hens fed 4.8% MA.

Northern blots on Drosophila heads showed that mRNA of Rh1 (the predominant rhodopsin) was high in vitamin A replete controls, very low in deprived flies, and increased upon feeding carrot juice to deprived flies as early as 1 hr. Expression of the ribosomal protein 49 [rp49] gene (the control) was equal both in deprivation and in replacement. Recovery of Rh1 protein upon such carotenoid replacement followed, barely detectable on Western blots at 4 hr but conspicuous by 8 hr. Alternative chromophore deprivation with yeast-glucose food yielded flies with opsin mRNA on Northerns but not rhodopsin, as demonstrated by Western blots, spectrophotometry and the electroretinogram (ERG). Rh1's mRNA but not Rh1 protein resulted from rearing flies from egg to adult on the otherwise deprivational medium supplemented with RA or beef brain-heart infusion. By comparing results from these different media it was concluded that: [1] deprivation and replacement affect opsin gene transcription; and [2] contradictory conclusions were from chromophore deprivation which does not eliminate all retinoid dependent factors which could affect the opsin promoter. Preliminary evidence shows that carotenoid deprivation decreases two proteins relevant to visual function: [1] phospholipase C (PLC); and [2] Drosophila retinoid binding protein (DRBP).",Experimental eye research,"['D000818', 'D015152', 'D015153', 'D002338', 'D004331', 'D004596', 'D005786', 'D015591', 'D012333', 'D017299', 'D014212']","['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carotenoids', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electroretinography', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Microspectrophotometry', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rod Opsins', 'Tretinoin']",Control of Drosophila opsin gene expression by carotenoids and retinoic acid: northern and western analyses.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000008', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000494']","[None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', 'genetics', None, 'drug effects', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8994352,1997

Lasalocid residues were determined in an egg sample from each of 161 egg producers in Northern Ireland using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, following reports from the Veterinary Medicines Directorate concerning the incidence of lasalocid residues in the United Kingdom. Approximately 66% of the eggs contained lasalocid residues at concentrations in excess of 0.3 ng/g. There was no apparent difference in the incidence of lasalocid residues between free range and battery eggs. Carry-over of lasalocid from medicated to unmedicated batches of both premix and feed, during milling processes, was identified as a possible cause of contamination. Subsequently, egg-laying birds were fed meal containing a range of lasalocid concentrations, similar to those found as a result of unintentional contamination at a feed mill (0.1-5.0 mg/kg). The concentrations of lasalocid, measured in their eggs, were similar to that found in the survey.

The double-crested cormorant (DCC) egg extract, after clean-up and concentration, was intended for use in egg injection studies to determine the embryotoxicity of the organic contaminants found within the eggs. Large-scale dialysis was used as a preliminary treatment to separate the extracted contaminants from the co-extracted sample lipids. The lipid was dialyzed in 80x5 cm semi-permeable membrane devices (SPMDs) in 50-ml aliquants. After the removal of 87 g of cholesterol by freeze-fractionation, the remaining lipid carryover (56 g) was removed by 100 routine gel permeation chromatography (GPC) operations. A 41,293-g sample was thus extracted and purified to the extent that it could easily be placed at a volume of 5 ml, the volume calculated to be necessary for the egg injection study. Analyses were performed comparing contaminant concentrations in the final purified extract to those present in the original egg material, in the extract after dialysis and cholesterol removal, and in the excluded materials. Recoveries of organochlorine pesticides through dialysis and cholesterol ranged from 96% to 135%.

7549088,"Previously, we reported that induction of peroxidation of synthetic phosphatidylcholines (PCs) containing a polyunsaturated fatty acid by Fe(2+)-EDTA in the presence of ascorbate resulted in the formation of four types of PCs with an sn-2-oxidatively fragmented acyl group, which had platelet-aggregating activity due to interaction with platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptors. These PCs were compounds with a short-chain monocarboxylate, omega-hydroxymonocarboxylate, dicarboxylate, and dicarboxylate semialdehyde residue, respectively. In this study, we investigated the PAF-like lipids formed during peroxidation of PCs from hen egg yolk, salmon roe, sea urchin eggs, and krill in an FeSO4/EDTA/ascorbate system. The platelet-aggregating activities of these oxidized PCs were all inhibited by FR-900452, an antagonist of PAF. The activity of oxidized krill PC, which was equivalent of 89.8 +/- 8.8 pmol 16:0-PAF/mumol of starting PC, was about 5 times those of oxidized PCs from salmon roe and sea urchin eggs, and about 50 times that of oxidized hen egg yolk PC.

Each group was fed a diet containing .02% beta-carotene, canthaxanthin, lutein, or basal control. After 20 d of feeding, eggs were collected daily from each experimental group for incubation. Two different hatches were set and chicks from each hatch were used for one of two different experiments. In both experiments, 24 chicks per treatment were vaccinated against Newcastle disease virus at 1 d of age and raised for 5 wk on a basal diet. In the second experiment, birds were revaccinated at 3 wk of age. In both experiments, at the end of 5 wk birds were killed and bursa of Fabricius, liver, and spleen were collected. For both experiments, there were no differences in antibody titers, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and relative bursa weights of chicks. However in the second experiment, birds hatched from breeders fed lutein had significantly lower relative liver weights than chicks of the other treatments, whereas birds hatched from the breeders fed beta-carotene and canthaxanthin had significantly lower spleen weights than the control.

7706323,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a recently discovered cyclic nucleotide with Ca2+ mobilizing activity. Caged cADPR was synthesized by reacting cADPR with 2-nitrophenethyldiazoethane. Elemental analyses, 1H NMR, and extinction coefficient measurements indicate that the product contains only one caging group. Anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography separated caged cADPR into two forms, which most likely represent isomers. Both forms could be uncaged with equal efficiency by UV exposure to regenerate cADPR. Photolysis of caged cADPR was accomplished effectively with a spectrofluorimeter. The efficiency of uncaging depended on wavelength with UV light shorter than about 320 nm being the most effective. Caged cADPR was biologically inactive and could induce Ca2+ release from sea urchin egg homogenates only after photolysis. Specificity of the Ca2+ release was shown by inhibition by 8-amino-cADPR, a specific antagonist of cADPR. To demonstrate its utility in live cells, caged cADPR was microinjected into sea urchin eggs.

Of these isolates, 80 were identified as Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, or F. sambucinum. The isolates of these species were grown on autoclaved wheat grains and examined for toxicity in a rat-feeding test. A total of 8 of 57 F. oxysporum isolates, 3 of 14 F. solani isolates, and 5 of 9 F. sambucinum isolates caused the death of the rats. Of the 16 toxic isolates, 1 isolate of F. oxysporum produced a substantial amount of moniliformin, which could account for its toxicity. None of the other 15 isolates produced trichothecenes, moniliformin, fusarochromanone, fumonisin B1, or wortmannin. F. sambucinum PZF-4 produced an unknown toxin in wheat culture. This new toxin, given the trivial name sambutoxin, caused toxic effects in rats, including body weight loss, feed refusal, hemorrhage in the stomach and intestines, and, finally, death when rats were fed diets supplemented with 0.05 and 0.1% sambutoxin. The toxin was also toxic to chicken embryos, and the 50% lethal concentration was 29.6 micrograms per egg.

8064267,"In a two-part crossover study, ten healthy men drank a moderate dose of ethanol (0.80 g/kg) in the morning after an overnight fast or immediately after breakfast. The breakfast consisted of orange juice (150 mL), fruit yogurt (250 mL), two cheese sandwiches, one boiled egg, and one cup of coffee with milk and sugar. Ethanol was determined in venous blood at various times after the start of drinking by headspace gas chromatography. All subjects felt less intoxicated when alcohol was ingested after breakfast compared with drinking on an empty stomach. The peak BAC (+/- SD) was 67 +/- 9.5 mg/dL (ethanol + food) compared with 104 +/- 16.5 mg/dL when the drinking occurred after an overnight fast (P < 0.001). The mean area under the alcohol concentration-time profile (0-->6h) was 398 +/- 56 mg/dL x h in the fasting state compared with 241 +/- 34 mg/dL x h when subjects drank alcohol after the meal (P < 0.001). The time required to metabolize the dose of ethanol was approximately two hours shorter after the subjects had eaten breakfast. These results suggest that food in the stomach before drinking not only leads to a lowering of the peak BAC and diminishes the feelings of intoxication, but also boosts the rate of ethanol metabolism.

8006309,"When attempting to generate mouse monoclonal antibodies to hen's egg ovalbumin, injection of commercially purified ovalbumin resulted in monoclonal antibodies, which when assayed against commercially purified ovalbumin (Gal d I) or ovomucoid (Gal d III), appeared to be specific to both. With the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-repurified ovalbumin and ovomucoid in assay procedures, monoclonal antibodies generated by commercially purified ovalbumin were found to be specific for ovomucoid only. To clarify this phenomenon, mice were serially injected with commercially purified ovalbumin or HPLC-repurified ovalbumin. It was found that most of the antibody response to commercially purified ovalbumin was directed against the minor (< 1%) ovomucoid contaminant and that HPLC-repurified ovalbumin failed to produce antibodies to ovomucoid. Commercially purified ovomucoid resulted in only minimal amounts of antibodies to ovalbumin. Thus when commercially purified ovalbumin is used both for immunization and immunoassay, most of the antibodies produced are actually against the small amount of ovomucoid contaminant, and not ovalbumin. To determine whether ovomucoid is the major antigenic and allergenic egg white protein in human beings, one group of 18 children with egg allergy were skin prick tested with half-log dilutions of egg white extract and diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE)-repurified ovomucoid, ovalbumin, and lysozyme. Ovomucoid mean wheal diameters were significantly greater than wheal diameters in response to ovalbumin, lysozyme, and egg white extract at the three most concentrated of five dilutions tested: 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/ml (p < 0.01). Serum ovomucoid-specific IgE and IgG antibody concentrations to DEAE-repurified ovomucoid were significantly greater than that to DEAE-repurified ovalbumin (p < 0.05). In a second study, 10 patients with egg allergy and persistent egg hypersensitivity were compared with 11 patients with egg allergy in whom clinical tolerance to egg developed. IgE antibodies to repurified ovomucoid were significantly greater in patients with persistent egg hypersensitivity compared with patients in whom clinical tolerance developed at the time of both initial and follow-up food challenges. In contrast, there were no significant differences in IgE antibody concentrations to repurified ovalbumin in either group at any time.

Selected foods that did not contain added benzoates but were previously reported to contain benzene were analyzed for comparison. More than 50 foods were analyzed by purge-and-trap or static headspace concentration and capillary gas chromatography. Benzene was quantitated by using the method of standard additions, and its identity was confirmed by mass selective detection.

Products that contain no or only low amounts of fat but a high percentage of protein can be identified by HPLC.

While in unirradiated samples no traces of special hydrocarbons (according to the fatty acid composition of egg) and no traces of the irradiation-specific compound 2-Dodecyl-cyclobutanone were found, irradiated control samples as well as products of two Belgian suppliers contained these substances. Additionally, regarding the rather high time consumption of gas chromatography, electron spin resonance (ESR)-measurements were carried out on the packaging material of egg products.

1510841,"In the mole crab Emerita asiatica, the main yolk proteins consist of two slow moving lipovitellins (Lv I and Lv II) of glycolipoprotein nature. Lv I cleaves into subunits (MW: 109,000 and 105,000) and Lv II gives rise to six subunits (MW: 65,000, 54,000, 50,000, 47,000, 44,000, and 42,000) in SDS-PAGE (with beta-mercaptoethanol). In order to observe the stability of Lv II as well as to achieve better resolution of the proteins, two different buffer systems (Phosphate buffered saline and tris-buffered saline), 40% sucrose, and glass distilled water were used as homogenizing media. Among them, better resolution was achieved with tris-buffered saline and 40% sucrose, and tris-buffered saline seems to be the ideal medium for elution of Lv II. The analysis of biochemical constituents of the major Lv II reveals a percentage composition of 69.325, 27.927, and 2.753 respectively for protein, lipid, and bound sugars. In the I stage embryo, protein comprises about 67.276%, lipid 29.65%, and bound sugars 3.015%. Vitellogenin (Vg) electrophoretically corresponding to the Lv I and Lv II was present in the female haemolymph during the entire period of embryogenesis. The number of subunits (8) of Vg in all stages remained unaltered and their approximate molecular weights were Vg1, 91,000; Vg2, 87,000; Vg3, 83,000; Vg4, 61,000; Vg5, 58,000; Vg6, 45,000; Vg7, 42,000; and Vg8, 38,000. Different proteins present in the embryos (I and IV stage) and the serum obtained from the animal carrying the I stage embryo were separated by gel-filtration in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sephadex (G-200) gel filtration chromatography was used to purify the Lv II in large quantity. Total lipid extracted from Lv II as well as the embryos belonging to different stages of development were separated into their constituent neutral, glycolipids, and phospholipids, using silicic acid column chromatography. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to isolate the different phospholipids purified from various stages of embryos and Lv II. As many as seven different phospholipids were separated from Lv II and I and IX stage embryos; and whereas thin layer chromatogram of V and VI stage embryos showed six different phospholipids, embryos of VII and VIII stage contained four phospholipid species. Cholesterol, glycolipids, and individual phospholipids isolated from the Lv II and I stage embryo were quantified spectrophotometrically and the results were discussed.",Molecular reproduction and development,"['D000818', 'D003386', 'D002850', 'D002851', 'D002855', 'D004527', 'D015387', 'D004591', 'D005260', 'D014819']","['Animals', 'Brachyura', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Egg Proteins', 'Egg Proteins, Dietary', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Vitellogenins']",Purification and characterization of vitellogenin and lipovitellins of the sand crab Emerita asiatica: molecular aspects of crab yolk proteins.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000302', None, None, 'Q000302']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', None, None, 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1510841,1992

The ability of three of these lectins, immobilized on a variety of supports, to separate these micro-organisms from pure cultures was investigated. Immobilization of the lectins on magnetic microspheres was the most effective method. Immobilized T. vulgaris lectin bound 87-100% of cells from cultures of L. monocytogenes, 80-100% of Staph. aureus, 33-45% of Salmonella spp. and 42-77% of E. coli. The A. bisporus lectin bound 31-63% of cells in cultures of L. monocytogenes, 83% of Staph. aureus but only 3-5% of the salmonella cells. Similarly H. pomatia lectin bound greater than 92% of Staph. aureus and 64% of L. monocytogenes cells but was poor at binding the Gram-negative organisms. This preference for binding Gram-positive organisms was confirmed when mixed cultures were studied. The T. vulgaris lectin was effective in removing L. monocytogenes (43%) and Staph. aureus (26%) from diluted milk and Salmonella (31-54%) from raw egg.

1621450,"A standardized method to determine the vitamin D content of food by means of HPLC is described. After the test material was homogenized and saponified with ethanolic aqueous potassium hydroxide solution, vitamin D was extracted using n-hexane. Using HPLC on a silica gel column, the fraction containing vitamin D is separated from the nonsaponifiable residue. After the fraction was reduced, the residue was dissolved in methanol and the vitamin D content determined after HPLC separation on an RP-C18 column. For evaluation, either a conventional external standard method using laboratory and matrix specific recovery rates as correction factors, or an internal standard method using vitamin D2, and D3, respectively as internal standards were employed. The method was developed and standardized by the working group ""Vitamin Analysis"" in accordance with section 35 LMBG (German Food Act). Repeatability and comparability of the results were checked in collaborative studies (14 laboratories) in milk powder and gruel that had been enriched with vitamin D3. Applicability of the method to other food (eggs, milk, fish, margarine) was checked separately. The statistical evaluation of the results of the collaborative studies has shown that the method is reliable enough to be included into the ""Amtliche Sammlung"" (official collection of analytical methods) according to section 35 LMBG. The present method may be used to determine the content of vitamin D2 and D3 in natural and vitaminized food.

1435943,"An isolate of Fusarium culmorum (W. G. Smith), Sacc. HM-8 from a scabby wheat kernel sample from England produced a novel toxin when grown in culture on rice. This toxin, which was given the trivial name of HM-8, was purified, its toxic properties demonstrated and its structure determined by spectroscopic methods. Subsequent to preliminary reports of our findings, two other laboratories have independently isolated the same substance from F. chlamydosporum and F. acuminatum, and demonstrated the same structure by spectroscopic methods and X-ray crystallography. Identity of the metabolite from F. culmorum HM-8 with the published structure is based on (1) identical elemental composition derived from both elemental analysis and high resolution mass spectrometry in electron impact and fast atom bombardment modes, (2) comparable melting point and chromatographic properties, and (3) the presence of characteristic absorption bands in the infrared, ultraviolet, and nuclear magnetic resonance (proton and carbon-13) spectra. Because both laboratories which subsequently isolated this metabolite have used the name chlamydosporol, it is being adopted here. The mass spectral properties of chlamydosporol are described.

The average Finnish daily diet was composed and analyzed both in spring and in autumn in order to minimize the effect of seasonal variation. The four tocopherols and four tocotrienols were then determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For comparison, the intake of vitamin E compounds was also calculated using the most recent Finnish analytical data on tocopherols and tocotrienols in food. According to the analytical results, the average daily vitamin E intake in Finland was 10.7 mg alpha-tocopherol equivalents (alpha-TE) of which amount 85% is due to alpha-tocopherol. The analyzed values (10.8 mg alpha-TE in spring and 10.7 mg alpha-TE in autumn) of vitamin E intake did not markedly differ from the calculated value (10.3 mg alpha-TE), thus indicating that the Finnish food composition data upon tocopherols and tocotrienols is up-to-date and accurate.

Sample preparation consists of merely acid treatment to precipitate protein, followed by gravity filtration. No concentration, extraction, derivatization, or preliminary column cleanup is necessary. The chromatography is done on muBondapack C18 with an aqueous mobile phase containing 0.15% sodium hexane sulfonate, 20% MeOH, 1.5% HOAc, and 0.1% EDTA at a flow rate of 2.5 mL/min. Ultraviolet detection at 248 nm is used. A typical run takes 7 min, and 60 samples can be processed in 4 h. Results average from 96 to 104% of theory for the infant formula products analyzed. A 99 to 103% recovery of spike has been demonstrated. Method precision is good (2 to 4% RSD, short-term, and 2 to 5% RSD, long-term, depending on sample type). Peak separation from thiamine phosphate esters is achieved. Specificity is demonstrated by UV spectral scan and absorbance ratios.

2303418,"A new polysialoglycoprotein, designated PSGP(On), was isolated from the unfertilized eggs of the kokanee salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka adonis. 400-MHz 1H NMR analyses showed the O. nerka adonis PSGP contained alpha -2,8-linked oligo- and polysialic acid (polySia) chains that were made up of 4-O-Ac-, 7-O-Ac-, and 9-O-Ac esters of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) residues. The presence of a new sialic acid derivative, identified by 1H NMR as 9-O-acetyl-2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (trivial name, 9-O-acetyldeaminated neuraminic acid; 9-O-Ac-KDN), was also shown to be present as a minor component. The O-acetylated KDN residues appear to cap the nonreducing termini of the O-acetylated poly(Neu5Gc) chains. The O-acetylated polySia chains were resistant to depolymerization by bacterial exosialidases and a bacteriophage-derived endo-N-acylneuraminidase that is specific for catalyzing the hydrolysis of alpha -2,8-linkages in polySia containing either N-acetylneuraminic acid or Neu5Gc residues. After de-O-acetylation by mild alkali, the polySia chains were sensitive to digestion by endo-N-acylneuraminidase, yet partially resistant to exosialidase. These data confirm the alpha -2,8-ketosidic linkage in these chains and the nonreducing terminal location of the KDN residues. These results extend further the range of structural diversity in polySia-containing glycoconjugates, and in the family of naturally occurring sialic acids.

The T3 concentration of the eggs just after fertilization (4-9 ng/g) was lower than the T4 concentration (5-15 ng/g). Both T4 and T3 concentrations in the whole body decreased steadily during yolk absorption, primarily due to the decline of the hormone content in the yolk. Both T4 and T3 were detected in blood plasma at later stages of yolk absorption, and the plasma levels increased toward the end of yolk absorption.

All fatty foods contained some PCB isomers with the 2,3,4,2',4',5'- and 2,4,5,2',4',5'-hexachlorobiphenyls present in all samples, except in skim milk and some dehydrated soups. The overall lowest PCB residues of all food commodities were found in skim milk, lamb, margarine and soups. Among the dairy products the highest PCB isomer levels were found in cheese and butter. The sum of all PCB isomers in these two commodities gave residue levels on a wet basis of 2.0 and 3.4 ng/g respectively. In the meat, fish and poultry class the highest specific PCB isomer levels were found in fish, especially freshwater fish, which contained a total of 21.0 ng PCB/g fish. In addition 28 out of the 34 selected PCB isomers were present in freshwater fish. Residue levels in canned fish were the second highest of all food commodities. The observed total PCB residue levels were below the Canadian guidelines for fish, dairy products, poultry, eggs and beef. A comparison of the percentage distribution of PCB isomers in fatty foods and human milk was difficult to evaluate due to the large variation of the fatty food data.

2717626,"Mathematical modeling of the kinetics of nickel absorption, distribution, and elimination was performed in healthy human volunteers who ingested NiSO4 drinking water (Experiment 1) or added to food (Experiment 2). Nickel was analyzed by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry in serum, urine, and feces collected during 2 days before and 4 days after a specified NiSO4 dose (12 micrograms of nickel/kg, n = 4; 18 micrograms of nickel/kg, n = 4; or 50 micrograms of nickel/kg, n = 1). In Experiment 1, each of the subjects fasted 12 hr before and 3 hr after drinking one of the specified NiSO4 doses dissolved in water; in Experiment 2, the respective subjects fasted 12 hr before consuming a standard American breakfast that contained the identical dose of NiSO4 added to scrambled eggs. Kinetic analyses, using a compartmental model, provided excellent goodness-of-fit for paired data sets from all subjects. Absorbed nickel averaged 27 +/- 17% (mean +/- SD) of the dose ingested in water vs 0.7 +/- 0.4% of the same dose ingested in food (a 40-fold difference); rate constants for nickel absorption, transfer, and elimination were not significantly influenced by the oral vehicle. The elimination half-time for absorbed nickel averaged 28 +/- 9 hr. Renal clearance of nickel averaged 8.3 +/- 2.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 in Experiment 1 and 5.8 +/- 4.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 in Experiment 2. This study confirms that dietary constituents profoundly reduce the bioavailability of Ni2+ for alimentary absorption; approximately one-quarter of nickel ingested in drinking water after an over-night fast is absorbed from the human intestine and excreted in urine, compared with only 1% of nickel ingested in food.

3666420,"In order to examine the role of thyroid hormones during salmonid development, techniques were developed for quantitative extraction of thyroxine from eggs, whole embryos, and alevins of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) at various stages of development. Frozen eggs, embryos, alevins, or fry were homogenized in ice-cold methanol. The homogenate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was washed with a mixture of chloroform and 0.05% CaCl2. The aqueous layer was lyophilized, and the residue was redissolved in barbital buffer for thyroxine radioimmunoassay (RIA). Serial dilutions of the egg or tissue extracts gave inhibition slopes that were parallel to that of the thyroxine standard in the RIA. Immunoreactivity of the extracts coeluted with thyroxine standard in reverse-phase HPLC on an ODS column. Recovery of thyroxine from egg and tissue extracts was estimated from the recovery of 125I-labeled thyroxine added to the initial homogenates. Thyroxine content of eggs just after fertilization was 4-5 ng/egg, and this level was maintained until hatching. A decrease in thyroxine content was seen during yolk absorption. Total thyroxine increased to about 10 ng/fish, a level higher than that in the unfertilized egg, at the time of complete yolk absorption, and decreased within 10 days to a low level of 1 ng/fish.

3090767,"In 1983 and 1984, in the State Veterinary Institute at Jihlava, 129 samples of eggs of wild birds of 14 species were analyzed coming from different regions of the Czech Socialist Republic for the presence of residues of chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). Apart from this, nine samples of hawk fat and 27 samples of buzzard fat were examined. The method of gas chromatography with a detector of electron capture was used for the analysis. The analyzed samples were found to contain residues of PCB, DDT (and mainly its metabolite DDE), HCB, alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH. No residues of other chlorinated carbohydrates were detected. The residue levels of these substances in the eggs and fatty tissues of different species of wild birds vary within a very wide range. A significant influence is exerted on these levels by the differences in food spectrum, the age of the birds, lack of food causing mobilization of food reserves, and mainly the environment where the birds live. The highest levels of residues were found in the eggs and fatty tissues of predatory birds with a narrow spectrum of food, i.e. those feeding on other birds (sparrow-hawk 33.00 mg.kg-1 in the dry matter of eggs, hawk 239.98 mg.kg-1 in fat) or those associated with water (great crested grebe 11.97 mg.kg-1, sea-gull 11.24 mg.kg-1 in the dry matter of eggs). Much lower levels of the residues of the chemicals were recorded in the species feeding mainly on small rodents (kestrel 0.681 mg.kg-1, buzzard 2.456 mg.kg-1 in the dry matter of eggs and 11.398 mg.kg-1 in fat).

The hemolytic reaction took place more rapidly at 37 degrees C than at 4 degrees C and did not require divalent cations. The degree of hemolysis was dependent on the concentration of the egg extracts. The hemolytic factors seemed to be lipid in nature because of being heat-stable and soluble in chloroform solvent. Further analysis by means of thin-layer chromatography showed that hemolytic activity in the extracts was due to free fatty acids. Analysis by gas chromatography revealed that fatty acids in the egg extracts consist of myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids. Among them, based on the experiments with commercially available fatty acids, arachidonic acid was the most intensively hemolytic, followed by linoleic, linolenic, oleic, palmitoleic, and myristic acids in that order, whereas palmitic acid showed weak activity only in the presence of divalent cations.

The relation between erythrocyte volume and infectivity was linear (1:1.2) up to a 50% hematocrit. The intraerythrocytic substance was both nondialyzable and poorly soluble in plasma. By carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography, cytoplasmic constituents eluted at pH 8.6 supported the same infection as control blood did; but higher and lower pH eluates supported none. Dialyzable factors present in the plasma, but absent from M199, enhanced infection but were not essential. Zygotes developed normally to ookinetes in the gut of plasma-fed mosquitoes, or when cultured in plasma or M199. Ookinetes from culture formed normal oocysts when fed to mosquitoes in blood or when injected with M199 into the hemocoels of unfed females. Mosquitoes fed infected blood containing lima bean or soybean trypsin inhibitor were unable to digest the erythrocytes and, although normal ookinetes developed, no oocysts formed.

About 1-2 g of a sample was accurately weighed and directly saponified. The extracted unsaponifiable matter was subjected to preparative HPLC using a reversed-phase column and a vitamin D fraction was collected. The fraction was subsequently subjected to analytical HPLC using a straight-phase column and vitamin D was assayed by estimating the peak height. The proposed method was applied to various kinds of samples, e.g., fishery products, fish meals, mixed feeds for fish farming and chicken farming, egg yolk, milk products, cattle liver, Shiitake, fortified foods and multivitamin preparations. The results showed that the proposed method was useful for the determination of vitamin D in such samples, because the peak of vitamin D in the profile of the second HPLC was always clearly separated from other concomitants and good recovery was obtained.

The reliability of such a technique was tested by studying as controls controls 17 days-old chick embryos injected with a known quantity of Cd(NO3). It showed no loss of cadmium. We also compared our procedure with a dry ashing method. The latter showed unacceptable losses and insufficient precision for the problems we wanted to investigate.

6636647,"To define the most accurate method for determination of sulfur-containing amino acids in foods, the possibility was tried of using a method suggested by Moore. The method is based on preliminary oxidation of cystine and methionine by performic acid and transformation of these substances to acid hydrolysis resistant cysteic acid and methionine sulphone. Model experiments and use of foods (wheat flour, grade II, and protein part of chicken egg) demonstrated that exposure of proteins to performic acid brings about oxidation of sulfur-containing amino acids to the hydrolysis-resistant forms which may be defined by chromatography with a greater accuracy. Experiments without preliminary oxidation by performic acid showed that foods experience an appreciable destruction (by 30-60%) of cystine and methionine. Therefore, it is advisable that during studies into amino acids contained by proteins, additional hydrolysis may be performed with preliminary oxidation of the samples by performic acid, which enables the determination of the content of methionine and cystine with a greater accuracy.",Voprosy pitaniia,"['D000603', 'D004044', 'D004527', 'D005433', 'D005504']","['Amino Acids, Sulfur', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Egg Proteins', 'Flour', 'Food Analysis']",[Determination of sulfur-containing amino acids in food products].,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6636647,1983

Thin-layer chromatography confirmed that each individual cardenolide visualized in the adult moths reared on the former host plant corresponds to one present in the plant, thus demonstrating that the insects' cardenolides are indeed derived from the larval food. Adult weights were significantly greater when the larvae had been fed upon the higher cardenolide plant species,A. humistrata. Similar results for other milkweed-feeding insects have been interpreted by some authors as evidence against a metabolic cost of handling cardenolides. However, such interpretations confound cardenolide differences among milkweed species with other differences in plant primary and secondary chemistry that affect insect growth and development. While the cooccurrence inC. tenera of other noxious chemicals (e.g., alkaloids) is not precluded, cardenolides sequestered from larval host plants have probably contributed to the evolution of visual and auditory aposematism in this species. As the eggs are laid in large clutches and larvae are gregarious, such aposematism may have evolved via kin selection.

6870816,"Gel-filtration analysis of cytosol fraction obtained from unfertilized sea-urchin (Anthocidaris crassispina) eggs on Sephadex G-75 revealed the presence of two Zn-binding-protein fractions. The major Zn-binding protein fraction had a low molecular weight and a low absorbance at 280 nm, properties similar to those of the metallothionein found in the regenerating rat liver. These fractions were further purified by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-50 chromatography. Homogeneity of the Zn-binding protein was judged by polyacrylamide-disc-gel electrophoresis and gel-permeation chromatography in the presence of 6 M-guanidinium chloride. The molecular weight determined by gel-permeation chromatography was 3900. This value is in good agreement with the minimum molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition, which was 3655. Zn-binding protein is composed of 36 amino acid residues and the distinctive features include an extremely high content of cysteine, which accounted for one-third of the total amino acid residues, and a complete absence of aromatic amino acids, as well as of methionine, histidine and arginine.

The control group was kept in similar conditions, receiving a bare piece of food. Blood was taken on empty stomach from the heart on heparin. With the methods adopted the following were examined in the plasma: total cholesterol, triglycerides, total fat and beta-lipoproteins. After bleeding the birds, extracts from the aorta intima and media and maturing egg cell yolk balls were made by the method of Folch et al., and then they were analysed with thin-layer chromatography on silica gel (Kieselgel-Fertigplatten DC Merck). Following densimetric measurements, the results obtained were statistically analysed, tabled and plotted in chromatograms. In general, almost a double concentration increase in the total cholesterol and fat, triglycerides and beta-lipoproteins was observed in comparison with control group.

Following fertilization, these mRNPs are derepressed and actively translated, presumably due to changes in the mRNA-associated proteins and their interaction with the mRNA. We have isolated poly(A)-containing egg mRNPs free of contaminating monoribosomes and ribosomal subunits by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose and identified their constituent proteins. Egg mRNPs isolated by using near physiological ionic conditions have 15-20 major proteins, most of which are in the molecular weight range of 40 000-100 000, and approximately 15-23 minor proteins in the 22 000-190 000 molecular range. The association of the proteins with poly(A)-containing mRNA is indicated by their greatly reduced retention on oligo(dT)-cellulose after pretreatment of the crude mRNP fraction with saturating amounts of poly(uridylic acid). Three of the proteins present in poly(A)-containing mRNPs from eggs, with molecular weights of 48 000, 67 000, and 140 000, were not detected in poly(A)-containing mRNPs derived from polyribosomes of hatched blastula-stage embryos.

A linear relationship was found between the amount of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) absorbed into 21-day-old eggs and the level of covalent modification of embryo DNA after exposure to 0.25 to 0.5 p.p.m. aqueous solutions of AFB1 for 1 h; higher concentrations resulted in absorption of a greater proportion of AFB1. The principal covalent product, identified after acid and enzymatic hydrolysis of isolated embryo DNA, was chromatographically identical to 2,3-dihydro-2-(N7-guanyl)-3-hydroxy aflatoxin B1. Additional AFB1 derivatives which were present are believed to be formed by chemical transformation of this product in DNA producing an aflatoxin-formamidopyrimidine adduct and the metabolic activation of other aflatoxin metabolites, such as aflatoxin M1 and aflatoxin P1. Although the eggs were exposed to AFB1 for a short time, covalent modification of DNA was evident over an extended period. The highest level of covalent products was present at approximately 24 h after exposure to 0.5 p.p.m. AFB1. Ninety-six hours later, this level had decreased slightly; however, the distribution of covalent adducts had changed: formamidopyrimidine adducts now represented up to 50% of the hydrolyzed aflatoxin derivatives.

Water, bottom sediments, aquatic plants, aquatic insects, fish, fish-eating birds and their eggs were collected. Insecticides and PCB's were analyzed by thin layer and gas chromatography and mass-spectrometry. Analysis of metals was accomplished with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Metals included arsenic, cadmium, copper, mangenese, lead, zinc, and mercury. The insecticide residue most commonly found in both dams were DDE, DDD, DDT, and dieldrin. Hartbeespoort had higher levesl than Voëlvlei of insecticides and PCB's in all types of samples common to both lakes. Concentrations of PCB's in all types of samples common to both lakes. Concentrations of PCB's having six or more chlorines increased with an increase in the trophic level. Concentrations of PCB's in the brains of the African birds were greater than the average total concentration of insecticides while the opposite was true for carcasses. Biological magnification of insecticides and PCB's occurred in both lakes. Hartbeespoort Dam had higher levels than Voëlvlei for all metals examined in bottom sediments and birds, except for copper in bird carcasses.

113983,"Earlier studies have shown that a substance(s) released from the egg jelly of the toad Bufo arenarum is required for fertilization. In this paper some properties of this diffusible factor were further examined, and a procedure was designed for its isolation from crude egg extracts. The active component is soluble in water and ethanol, and insoluble in chloroform, ether and n-butanol. The biological activity is stable to liophylization and to heat, and remains unaffected after trypsin treatment. In contrast, it is impaired after treatment with ethyl acetate, 0.1 N HCl or chloroform, and is completely destroyed after converting the diffusible factor into ash. Data are presented showing that the recovery of fertilizability of extracted eggs in the bioassay system as carried out under present conditions, cannot be ascribed to a pH alteration of the insemination medium. This lends further support to the view that diffusible factor activity is not mediated through a pH effect. The factor was purified by gel chromatography coupled with desalting and paper chromatography. The active molecule is of low molecular weight and appears associated with a high pH ninhydrin-positive fraction.",Acta physiologica latino americana,"['D000818', 'D002022', 'D005260', 'D005306', 'D010063']","['Animals', 'Bufo arenarum', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Ovum']",Properties and isolation of the diffusible factor involved in Bufo arenarum fertilization.,"[None, 'Q000502', None, None, 'Q000502']","[None, 'physiology', None, None, 'physiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/113983,1979
999932,"Bovine brain gangliosides incorporated into phospholipid liposomes provide receptors for wheat germ agglutinin. Purified monosialogangliosides were mixed with egg phosphatidylcholine, and unilamellar liposomes were generated. Addition of wheat germ agglutinin induced the liposomes to fuse, and gel filtration analysis revealed that the lectin was incorporated into the fused liposomes. The fusion process was studied by following the changes in the 90 degrees light scattering. Increasing the proportion of the monosialoganglioside in the liposomes was found to increase both the extent of the lectin-induced liposome fusion and the rate of the reaction; below a threshold of approx. 5 mol%, the process was extremely slow. The increase in light scattering could be prevented by the addition of the hapten inhibitor, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (1 mM). Addition of the inhibitor, subsequent to the lectin, caused a partial decrease in light scattering due to the dissociation of unfused vesicle aggregates. Electron microscopic examination revealed that the ganglioside-containing liposomes were vesicles, 244 +/- 25 A (S.D.) in diameter. Upon addition of wheat germ agglutinin, the vesicles appeared to fuse to form larger vesicles, corresponding to dimers and trimers of the initial vesicles. Inhibition studies with a variety of monosaccharides indicated that the sialic acid moieties present in the ganglioside acted as the lectin-receptor sites. This was confirmed by the observation that wheat germ agglutinin did not interact with phosphatidylcholine vesicles containing desialyated ganglioside.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,"['D001665', 'D001667', 'D005732', 'D006601', 'D007700', 'D037102', 'D008027', 'D008081', 'D008854', 'D008954', 'D010713', 'D037121', 'D012542', 'D012639', 'D012794', 'D013050', 'D014908']","['Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Gangliosides', 'Hexoses', 'Kinetics', 'Lectins', 'Light', 'Liposomes', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Plant Lectins', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Seeds', 'Sialic Acids', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Triticum']",Lectin-receptor interactions in liposomes.

Eggs from carnivorous species at the top of the aquatic food chain had the highest mean residues of signa DDT(7.6to 22.4 pm), PCB (3.5 to 74.0 ppm) and total mercury (0.64 to 0.83 ppm). Eggs from some terrestrial carnivores (red-tailed hawk and great horned owl) also had relatively high residues (2.5 to 3.9 ppm of sigmaDDT, 0.2 to 1.0 ppm of PCB, 0.06 to 0.09 ppm of mercury, however levels were much lower than those found in eggs from aquatic-feeding carnivores. Eggs from one red-shouldered hawk had residues comparable to the aquatic feeding carnivores. Eggs from herbivorous and insectivorous birds of both aquatic and terrestrial environments contained much lower residues. PCB residues were slightly lower in eggs among the terrestrial feeding species (0.05 to 2.0 ppm) than among the aquatic feeders (0.14 to4.0 ppm) and tended to be lower in eggs from terrestrial species collected in rural than incity environs.

By ion-exchange chromatography three active proteins (isolectins) were separated, one of which was examined in detail. 2. The amino acid composition is unusual, as 20% of residues are half-cystine and 21% are glycine. Unlike most lectins and contrary to previous reports, this protein is not a glycoprotein. 3. The efficiency of various saccharides as inhibitors of the agglutination reaction was investigated and from this the specificity of the binding site was inferred. Of monosaccharides, only derivatives of glucose with a 2-acetamido group and a free 3-hydroxyl group are effective inhibitors, and glycosides of either anomeric configuration are bound. Oligosaccharides are much more powerful inhibitors of agglutination than are monosaccharides. 4.

5000276,"1. Before the uptake of water that precedes spawning, eggs of cod (Gadus morhua L.) contained 30% dry matter, of which 80% was protein. Some 75% of this protein was soluble in 0.5m-sodium chloride. The major components in the extract were two similar lipoproteins, of molecular weight about 400000, containing 21% lipid, some two-thirds of which was phospholipid, and about 0.5% protein phosphorus. 2. These lipoproteins were identified by immunochemical methods in the serum of female cod with developing ovaries, but not in the serum of male or of immature female fish. 3. The concentrations of egg proteins in the serum of female cod were determined by a serial-dilution double-diffusion immunological method, and were shown to increase with development of the ovaries, reaching a value of about 32mg/ml when the weight of the ovaries was 10% of the weight of the fish. 4. Immature male and female cod were injected intramuscularly with a solution of oestradiol-17beta 3-benzoate in oil and the concentration of egg proteins in their serum was measured by the immunodiffusion method. The serum contained no detectable egg proteins before injection of the fish, but 30mug of oestradiol benzoate/kg gave rise to detectable amounts of egg proteins in 10 days, and with 300mug or 1mg of oestradiol benzoate/kg the concentration of egg proteins rose to 32mg/ml. The values for male and female cod were similar and represented about one-half of the total serum protein. 5. With a dose of 1mg of oestradiol benzoate/kg, egg proteins were first detected in the serum 2 days after injection and the concentration increased up to 10 days. 6. Serum samples taken before and 10 days after an injection of 1mg of oestradiol benzoate/kg were fractionated by gel-filtration on Sephadex G-200. The difference curves obtained from fractionation curves after and before injection confirmed the values of the concentrations of egg proteins obtained from the immunodiffusion test and showed that the concentrations of the normal serum components fell by 20-50% of the initial value, the high-molecular-weight globulins showing the most marked fall. 7.

Kinetic parameters and binding equilibrium constant were essentially the same in vivo and in vitro. The binding site protein was shown to have a sedimentation constant of 6S by zone centrifugation. The protein was present in extracts of the isolated mitotic apparatus at a concentration which was several times higher than in whole-egg homogenates. It was extracted from the mitotic apparatus at low ionic strength under conditions which lead to the disappearance of microtubules. No binding could be detected to the 27S protein, previously described by Kane, which is a major protein component of the isolated mitotic apparatus. The properties of the colchicine-bindinG protein, (binding constant, sedimentation constant, Sephadex elution volume) are similar to those obtained with the protein from mammalian cells, sea-urchin sperm tails, and brain tissue, and thus support the conclusion that the protein is a subunit of microtubules.",The Journal of cell biology,"['D000818', 'D002455', 'D002501', 'D002850', 'D003078', 'D004447', 'D005260', 'D005306', 'D007700', 'D009940', 'D010063', 'D011485', 'D011506', 'D014316']","['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Centrifugation, Zonal', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Colchicine', 'Echinodermata', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Kinetics', 'Organoids', 'Ovum', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Tritium']",The mechanism of action of colchicine.
