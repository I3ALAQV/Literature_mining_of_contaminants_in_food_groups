35327266,"Kefalograviera is a well-known hard Greek cheese. The aim of this study was to determine how milk produced from ewes fed omega-3-enriched diets could influence the microbiota as well as the chemical composition of Kefalograviera cheese. At the start of the trial, 30 dairy ewes (Lesvos and Chios crossbreed) were selected and fed a conventional diet, based on alfalfa hay, straw and concentrate feed that contained soybean meal for a period of thirty days. Then, for a period of sixty days the same ewes were fed an omega-3-enriched concentrate feed with a lower level of soybean meal that contained 10% flaxseed and 10% lupins. Milk yield was collected individually on Days 30, 60 and 90 and used to produce three different batches of Kefalograviera cheeses, at the same cheese factory, by using a traditional recipe and identical preparation conditions (pasteurization of milk, salt, rennet and culture). Sample analysis was done after six months of Kefalograviera cheese ripening. MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry) identification was performed by contrasting the samples' mass spectra with the corresponding reference database.

The PTEs contents were determined in widely consumed dairy products (pasteurized milk, sour cream, matsoun and cheese from cow milk) using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. PTE contents were in the range of 7.90E-04 (Pb in pasteurized milk) to 6.75E-01 (Cu in cheese) mg/kg. Food consumption was assessed by the 24-h dietary recall method. The PTE daily intakes and margin of exposure (MOE) were calculated by the deterministic approach. The results indicated potential health concerns for the contribution of dairy products to the overall dietary intake of Pb and Cd. MOEs of Pb and Cd (8.71 and 8.80, respectively) estimated for high consumers of cheese (90 g/day and more) were lower than 10.

Being the main byproduct of cheese-making, the revalorization of milk whey is nowadays one of the primary goals in alignment with the principles of the circular economy. In the present paper, a deep and detailed investigation of short endogenous peptides in milk and its byproducts (whole whey, skimmed whey, and whey permeate) was carried out by high-resolution mass spectrometry, with a dedicated suspect screening data acquisition and data analysis approach. A total of 79 short peptides was tentatively identified, including several sequences already known for their exerted biological activities. An unsupervised chemometric approach was then employed for highlighting the differences in the short peptide content among the four sets of samples. Whole and skimmed whey showed not merely a higher content of short bioactive peptides compared to whole milk, but also a peculiar composition of peptides that are likely generated during the process of cheese-making. The results clearly demonstrate that whey represents a valuable source of bioactive compounds and that the set-up of processes of revalorization of milk byproducts is a promising path in the obtention of high revenue-generating products from dairy industrial waste.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000818', 'D003611', 'D000077488', 'D005504', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D010455', 'D057786']","['Animals', 'Dairy Products', 'Data Science', 'Food Analysis', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Peptides', 'Peptidomimetics']",High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry and Chemometrics for the Detailed Characterization of Short Endogenous Peptides in Milk By-Products.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34770881,2021

The whole genome of these two lactobacilli was first sequenced. Then, the thermoresistance was evaluated after treatment at 60 °C for 5 min and compared to reference strains. Both lactobacilli were highly thermoresistant compared to other three lactic acid bacteria which are Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris ATCC 19257 and SK11, and L. plantarum ATCC 14917 (P < 0.0001). They lost less than 1 log cfu/mL (Δlog) and their genome contained a great number of copy number of genes coding for heat shock protein. During a Pearce test activity simulating Cheddar cheesemaking, the two lactobacilli did not show interaction with the starter Lcc. lactis subsp. cremoris SK11, and their population remained stable. During a ripening simulation, L. delbrueckii RKG R10 had a slight loss in viability in cheese slurry samples incubated at 30 °C for 12 d.

OTA was detected in seven out of 51 samples of grated hard cheese (concentration range 1.3-22.4 µg/kg), while it was not found in the 33 cheeses of other types which were also analysed. These data show a low risk of OTA contamination for almost all types of cheese analysed. To improve the safety of cheese marketed in grated form, more regulations on cheese rind, which is the part most susceptible to OTA-producing moulds, should be implemented or, alternatively, producers should consider not using the rind as row material for grated cheese. It would be interesting to continue these investigations particularly on grated hard cheeses to have more data to update the risk assessment of OTA in cheese, as also suggested by EFSA in its 2020 scientific opinion on OTA.",Toxins,"['D002611', 'D002853', 'D005506', 'D007558', 'D009793', 'D053719']","['Cheese', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Italy', 'Ochratoxins', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Occurrence of Ochratoxin A in Different Types of Cheese Offered for Sale in Italy.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34437411,2022

Previous human intervention studies identified several biomarkers for dairy foods in blood and urine using non-targeted metabolomics. We evaluated the robustness of these biomarkers in a free-living cohort in the Netherlands using both single- and multi-marker approaches. Plasma and urine from 246 participants (54 ± 13 years) who completed a food frequency questionnaire were analyzed using liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The targeted metabolite panel included 37 previously-identified candidate biomarkers of milk, cheese, and/or yoghurt consumption. Associations between biomarkers and energy-adjusted dairy food intakes were assessed by a 'single-marker' generalized linear model, and stepwise regression was used to select the best 'multi-marker' panel. Multi-marker models that also accounted for common covariates better captured the subtle differences for milk (urinary galactose, galactitol; sex, body mass index, age) and cheese (plasma pentadecanoic acid, isoleucine, glutamic acid) over single-marker models. No significant associations were observed for yogurt.

33346308,"Aside from their amino acid content, dairy proteins are valuable for their ability to carry encrypted bioactive peptides whose activities are latent until released by digestive enzymes or endogenous enzymes within the food. Peptides can possess a wide variety of functionalities, such as antibacterial, antihypertensive, and antioxidative properties, as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo studies. This phenomenon raises the question as to what impact various traditional cheese-making processes have on the formation of bioactive peptides in the resulting products. In this study, we have profiled the naturally-occurring peptides in two hard and two soft traditional cheeses and have identified their known bioactive sequences. While past studies have typically identified fewer than 100 peptide sequences in a single cheese, we have used modern instrumentation to identify between 2900 and 4700 sequences per cheese, an increase by a factor of about 50. We demonstrated substantial variations in proteolysis and peptide formation between the interior and rind of each cheese, which we ascribed to the differences in microbial composition between these regions. We identified a total of 111 bioactive sequences among the four cheeses, with the greatest number of sequences, 89, originating from Mimolette. The most common bioactivities identified were antimicrobial and inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme.

The contents of pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen, 12% trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen and 5% phosphotungstic acid-soluble nitrogen changed significantly during the ripening of the Monascus-ripened cheese. The peptides in the Monascus-ripened cheese were evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. During ripening, many low-molecular-weight peptides (MW < 14400) were found to increase significantly and the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic peptides decreased to 0.81 and 0.34 in the Red-O (outer) and Red-I (interior) parts of the cheese, respectively.

Such cheese is intended as a ""gender food"", that could be used as a hedonistic dietary strategy to reduce the incidence of woman vaginal dysbiosis and infections, given the evidence that a probiotic strain able to survive to the entire digestive process once ingested, can pass from intestine to vagina. This work was aimed to evaluate the resistance of L. crispatus BC4, carried in Squacquerone cheese, to different challenges of the human gastrointestinal tract, including the colon stage. The digestion process was tested using a Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®). The viability and metabolic activity of L. crispatus BC4 during the colon simulation were monitored by qPCR and gas chromatography, respectively, also in the presence of a complex microbiota. The results showed that L. crispatus BC4 survival was not affected by the gastric condition, while it was significantly affected by bile salts and pancreatic juice in small intestine conditions, where it decreased of approx. 0.6 log (colony-forming units) CFU/g. Differently, during colon simulation L. crispatus BC4 was able to grow in sterile colon conditions and to maintain viability in the presence of a complex microbiota. Moreover, during colon simulation, L. crispatus BC4 was metabolically active as demonstrated by the higher production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactate. In the presence of a complex gut microbiota, a decrease of lactate was observed, due to its conversion into propionate (anti-cholesterol activity) and butyrate (anti-inflammatory activity) by cross-feeding. However, no differences in propionate and butyrate production could be observed between control cheese and cheese containing L. crispatus BC4. Despite this may appear as a negative outcome, it must be taken into account that, in this setup, only a single dose of the cheese was tested and the outcome of the colonization and impact of the gut microbiota might be different when daily repeated doses are tested.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D002611', 'D017753', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007422', 'D000070003', 'D019936']","['Cheese', 'Ecosystem', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestines', 'Lactobacillus crispatus', 'Probiotics']","Evaluation of the fate of Lactobacillus crispatus BC4, carried in Squacquerone cheese, throughout the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME).","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33233191,2021

For that, samples of raw milk were fortified with MON at three different nominal concentrations (1.0, 2.0 and 8.0 μg/kg), passed through heat treatment and used to produce Minas Frescal cheese. Pasteurization efficiency was certified by alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase enzyme tests and cheese samples were evaluated for pH, moisture and total protein and fat content. MON residues were determined by LC-MS/MS in the following steps: raw milk, heat-treated milk, whey and cheese. No significant degradation of MON due to heat treatment was observed, suggesting that the drug is resistant to high temperatures. Moreover, the residue levels quantified in cheese and whey demonstrated a concentration of this antibiotic in the curd by about 5-fold, with a small amount of MON being lost during draining. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) considering the physicochemical parameters evaluated in cheese samples. Fermentation was also not affected by the presence of the drug.

Improving the texture and flavor of cheese by selecting suitable starter cultures is an important way to promote the development of cheese industry. The effect of starter cultures on the physicochemical and textural properties and volatile compounds during the ripening of semihard goat cheese were investigated in this work. Different starter cultures-mesophilic (M) and thermophilic starters (T), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum ATCC 14917 (Lp), a mix of the M and T starters (M1), and mix of the M, T, and Lp starters (M2)-were used in the production of the goat cheeses. Volatile compounds were determined by a solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (SPME/GC-MS) method. The results showed that the moisture content of cheeses produced with the 5 kinds of starter cultures decreased after maturation, whereas ash content increased. The pH values of goat cheeses decreased first and then increased during maturity, and the pH value of M2 cheese was the lowest among the cheeses. The hardness and chewiness of the cheeses increased with increasing maturity, whereas cohesiveness, springiness, and resilience showed the opposite tendency. The 60-d-old cheese made with Lp had the highest chewiness, cohesiveness, springiness, and resilience, whereas the 60-d-old cheese made with M2 had the highest hardness. A total of 53 volatile components were identified by SPME/GC-MS, and carboxylic acids, alcohols, ketones, and esters were the 4 major contributors to the characteristic flavors of the cheeses. Volatile components and their contents differed greatly among the produced cheeses. The M2 cheese contained the highest relative content of the main volatile compounds (90.10%), especially butanoic acid and acetoin.

Thirty-six Friesian cows, balanced for parity, milk production, and days in milk, were randomly assigned to four groups. The control group (CG) was fed with a conventional feeding strategy, while the three remaining groups received a diet enriched with three different trace elements, respectively zinc (ZG), selenium (SG), and iodine (IG). At the end of the experimental period, samples of milk were collected and used to produce Caciocavallo cheese from each experimental group. Cheese samples were then analyzed after 7 and 120 days from the cheese making in order to obtain information on chemical composition and extent of the proteolytic process, evaluated through the electrophoretic analysis of caseins and the determination of volatiles profile. Both milk and cheese samples were richer in the amount of the microelement respectively used for the integration of the cattle's diet. The zymographic approach was helpful in evaluating, in milk, the proteolytic function performed by endogenous metalloenzymes specifically able to degrade gelatin and casein; this evaluation did not highlight significant differences among the analyzed samples. In cheese, the electrophoretic analysis in reducing and denaturing condition showed the marked ability of β-casein to resist the proteolytic action during ripening, whereas the dietary selenium supplementation was shown to perform a protective action against the degradation of S1 and S2 isoforms of α-casein. The analysis of the volatile profile evidenced the presence of compounds associated with proteolysis of phenylalanine and leucine. This approach showed that selenium was able to negatively influence the biochemical processes that lead to the formation of 3-methyl butanol, although the identification of the specific mechanism needs further investigation.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000821', 'D000818', 'D002364', 'D002417', 'D002611', 'D002849', 'D004032', 'D019587', 'D004591', 'D005260', 'D018093', 'D007455', 'D007774', 'D007930', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D000439', 'D010649', 'D011247', 'D020033', 'D059748', 'D012643', 'D055549', 'D015032']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Caseins', 'Cattle', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Gelatinases', 'Iodine', 'Lactation', 'Leucine', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Pentanols', 'Phenylalanine', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteolysis', 'Selenium', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Zinc']",Proteolytic Volatile Profile and Electrophoretic Analysis of Casein Composition in Milk and Cheese Derived from Mironutrient-Fed Cows.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397653,2021

However, note that some compounds in fermented foods interfere with assay results. In this study, the pretreatments and conditions of the assay for fermented foods were evaluated. Lowering the reaction temperature from 37 to 23°C was considerably effective in reducing the interference. As a result, histamine in salami and sauerkraut (≥5 to 10 mg/kg) could be determined with a 25-fold dilution, as in the manufacturer's instructions.

The procedure was validated according to the guidelines of the EU Commission Decision 2002/657/EC in terms of: specificity, method calibration range (from the limit of quantification to 25-50 ppm), sensitivity (limit of detection 0.1-0.2 ppm; limit of quantification, 0.3-0.6 ppm), trueness (92.5-102.3%), precision (<7.5%, expressed at RSD), robustness, and stability. The method is reliable, sensitive, easy-to-handle, eco-friendly, safe, inexpensive, and provides a high sample-throughput. Therefore, it is useful for routine analysis as a screening or quantification method in a laboratory for drug-residue control.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Use of Micellar Liquid Chromatography to Determine Mebendazole in Dairy Products and Breeding Waste from Bovine Animals.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075155,2020
32008582,"Bovine κ-casein glycomacropeptide (GMP) found in cheese whey is a sialylated phosphorylated peptide which is thought to be a potential ingredient for functional food as well as dietetic food. This study was undertaken to determine whether high purity GMP can be isolated from soluble whey fraction (SWF) using column chromatography on food grade anion exchange resin and chitin as an adsorbent. Samples of commercially available anion exchange resin (resin A, resin B and resin C) and those of chitin (chitin A, chitin B and chitin C) were examined in this experiment. The GMP fraction obtained from each column was analyzed for amino acid composition which reflects the purity of the peptide. Major findings for commercial anion exchange resin were that: (1) the proportion of GMP monitored as sialic acid in total recovered sialic acid was similar among the three samples of resin accounting for average 78% of recovered sialic acid; (2) the GMP fraction from resin A or resin B contained undetectable level of contaminating amino acids including phenylalanine, histidine, arginine and tyrosine; (3) the GMP fraction from resin C contained small amounts (<1 mol%) of contaminating amino acids, arginine, phenylalanine and tyrosine; and (4) the GMP binding capacity expressed as mg/100 mg dry weight of resin was more than 2.5 times higher in resin C (average 22.9) than in resin A or resin B with no difference between resin A and resin B averaging 8.7. Results obtained for chitin A, chitin B and chitin C were in general similar to those found with resin A and resin B. Since chitin has a remarkable GMP binding capacity averaging 8.6 mg/100 mg dry weight of chitin, it may be a useful adsorbent for whey fractionation.

Five long-time-ripened cheeses made from different milk types were analysed for histamine producing bacterial isolates. The ability of the isolates to produce histamine was tested by incubation at 37 °C for five days in a restricted media with a pH indicator. Changes in the amino-compound profile were investigated using ultra performance liquid chromatography. Only eight of 106 isolates were able to produce compounds raising the pH and seven of those were confirmed to be histamine producers. Despite the fact that all isolates were obtained from the same vintage Danish Gouda cheese, made from raw cow milk, the amino-compound profile as well as the response to different environmental conditions diverged between the isolates. Rep-PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to further characterize the isolates. Pediococcus pentosaceus was for the first time reported to be a histamine producer in cheese. The presence of the histidine decarboxylase gene (hdcA) was confirmed by PCR amplification of the histidine decarboxylase gene in four of the isolates. The results indicate that evaluating the presence and concentration of histamine is not only a relevant parameter to evaluate quality and safety, but is also an important tool to classify histamine producers in cheese.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D001419', 'D002611', 'D005516', 'D006632']","['Bacteria', 'Cheese', 'Food Microbiology', 'Histamine']",Histamine forming behaviour of bacterial isolates from aged cheese.,"['Q000145', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000378']","['classification', 'microbiology', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31955783,2021
31954576,"In the present study, the sensory characteristics and the volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles of high-moisture mozzarella made by different acidification techniques were compared. The cheeses were manufactured at the same dairy by fermentation by autochthonous natural whey starter (traditional backslopping method) and direct acidification with citric acid (the most used industrial technology). Three cheesemaking trials were performed from February to June using raw milk from a single farm. The mozzarella samples were subjected to assessment of the chemical, microbiological, and sensory characteristics and to VOC analysis by headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The relevant microbiological differences found between the 2 types of products were reflected in different sensory and VOC profiles. The cheeses were clearly discriminated by the panel, and traditional mozzarella had higher intensity attributes. The most discriminating descriptors were elasticity, overall odor and taste intensity, sour milk and fruity/vegetable odors, sour taste, and aftertaste. Even though some variability was observed among the trials, the VOC profile of traditional product was always much more complex than that obtained by direct acidification. In both products the carbonyl compounds were the most abundant chemical class, accounting for about 50% of the total. In detail, 51 compounds were identified in the entire set of samples, and their contribution to cheese aroma was roughly estimated by calculating the odor activity values on the basis of the odor thresholds available in the literature. The results allowed hypothesizing that only 12 of them could play a primary role. The most important among the odor-active compounds was 3-methyl-butanal that can both derive from metabolism of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts.

MFH was utilized as food packaging material, equipped with the developed properties. MFH was synthesized with a redox polymerization technique in film form on petri dishes. Mechanical and water resistance properties of MFH were improved by CA and N, N, methylenebisacrylamide, while PE was used to gain antimicrobial, antioxidant and anthocyanin properties. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA), Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) instruments were utilized for characterization of MFH. FTIR revealed the existence of bonding interactions between the functional group of PE and gelatin, carbonyl groups of DMAAm and carboxylic acid groups of CA. TGA results indicate that MFH was stable up to 400 °C. Then the response of total antioxidant and anthocyanin activities leading to the color change in MFH were studied at different pH values. The color change in MFH was monitored even at very small pH changes in the medium. Moreover, antimicrobial activity and stability of MFH were investigated when it was tested in harsh environments and against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus on real samples of whole pasteurized milk and cheese for a 7-day period. It exhibited remarkable antimicrobial activity with pasteurized whole milk and cheese.

The proposed method allowed detecting 19 free amino acids and cystine with overall limits of detection and quantification lower than 44 μmol/L (1.4 mg/100 g cheese, wet matter) and than 134 μmol/L (4.2 mg/100 g cheese, wet matter), respectively. In all cheeses, 17 free amino acids were quantified including 8 essential amino acids (histidine, leucine-isoleucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine) and 9 non-essential amino acids (arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, proline, serine and tyrosine). The amounts of the free amino acids, essential free amino acids, branched chain free amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) plus the free amino acids ratios (mg/g protein) were further used to identify the producer of Serra da Estrela cheeses.

For this purpose, two mass spectrometry techniques were used: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time of flight mass spectrometry together with principal component analysis method and liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

31514309,"There is mounting evidence that the consumption of fermented dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt is associated with a reduced risk of type II diabetes. This effect is greater than in fresh milk and differs between cheese and yoghurt. However, the molecular components responsible for the effect are not known. We tested the hypothesis that the lipid and/or glyceride profiles of yoghurts and cheeses are distinct from one another and fresh milk. We developed a novel sample preparation technique for high-fat samples that can be used with Direct Infusion-Mass Spectrometry. We found that the lipid and glyceride profiles of cheddars from the UK, Ireland and France, and hard cheeses from Sweden and Italy were similar to one another but distinct from unfermented dairy products. The lipid and glyceride profile of yoghurts was varied and included types that may be similar to fresh milk. Several odd-chain-containing triglycerides were more abundant, while a variety of others were less abundant, in fermented milk samples. Phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were more abundant in cheeses, with evidence that the phosphatidylethanomine profile is re-modelled in a way that reflects the bacterial cell envelope. We concluded that a combination of microorganismal metabolism, concentration of the lipid/glyceride fraction and oxidation during fermentation contribute to the observed lipid profile if fermented dairy foods. These differences in the lipid and glyceride profile provide a new avenue for understanding why different fermented dairy foods show a different association with reduced disease risk compared to unfermented dairy.",Nutrients,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D003924', 'D005285', 'D005516', 'D005989', 'D006801', 'D000081362', 'D008055', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D009753', 'D015014']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Fermentation', 'Food Microbiology', 'Glycerides', 'Humans', 'Lipidomics', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Nutritive Value', 'Yogurt']",Fermentation of Milk into Yoghurt and Cheese Leads to Contrasting Lipid and Glyceride Profiles.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'metabolism', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514309,2020

31476250,"Caper (Capparis spinosa) is an important food ingredient whose fresh parts, particularly the flower buds, are consumed as a starter with olives, cheese, and nuts, or are used as a component in other foods. It is one of the most popular species of aromatic plants grown in the Mediterranean zone. Fermentation makes the caper edible and affects the overall aroma as well as sensory and nutritional characteristics. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in aroma, aroma-active, and phenolic compounds of caper as affected by fermentation. Purge and trap method was used for the extraction of the aroma compounds, while gas chromatography-mass spectrometry olfactometry and Liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS) were employed for the detection of aroma-active compounds and phenolics, respectively. The results showed that the total amount of aroma compounds decreased drastically (62,616 to 21,471 µg/kg) in fermented sample. Twelve and 10 aroma-active compounds were detected in fresh and fermented caper buds, respectively, for the first time by the application of aroma extract dilution analysis. Among these compounds, methyl isothiocyanate (flavor dilution [FD] factor = 512) in fresh caper and acetic acid (FD factor = 128) in the fermented caper had the highest FD factor. With regard to the phenolic compounds, a total of 16 components were identified in fresh and fermented capers. As observed in aroma compounds, the total phenolic concentration decreased as a result of fermentation. Two phenolic compounds being kaempferol-3-O-glucosyl-rhamnosyl-glucoside and isorhamnetin hexoside were newly identified in caper. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Capparis spinosa is one of the most popular sources of different secondary metabolites of interest to consumers. The results of the present study showed that the fermentation process of the capers is highly influential on the neutral composition of the sample. The total concentrations of aroma and phenolic compounds were reduced by 66% and 78%, respectively, in response to fermentation process.",Journal of food science,"['D000975', 'D019149', 'D031484', 'D002853', 'D005285', 'D000074421', 'D005421', 'D008401', 'D009812', 'D064367', 'D021241', 'D053719']","['Antioxidants', 'Bioreactors', 'Capparis', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Fermentation', 'Fermented Foods', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Odorants', 'Olfactometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","Characterization of Aroma-Active Compounds, Phenolics, and Antioxidant Properties in Fresh and Fermented Capers (Capparis spinosa) by GC-MS-Olfactometry and LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS.","['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476250,2019

The European Union has established maximum residue limits in milk; these, however, by themselves do not guarantee the absence of drug residues in milk and related products. Currently, very little information is available on the transfer of antibiotic residues from milk to other dairy products and their potential effect on food safety. This work evaluated the presence of antibiotic residues in pasteurized fluid milk and fresh cheeses from goat's milk containing these veterinary drugs at legal safety levels (maximum residue limits) and assessed the safety margin of these dairy products for consumers. Eight antibiotics (amoxicillin, benzylpenicillin, cloxacillin, neomycin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and oxytetracycline) were selected, and three batches of fresh cheese were made from pasteurized goat's milk spiked with each of these drugs. Drug residues in milk and cheese samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The safety margin of goat's milk products was calculated taking into account different age groups (children, teenagers, and adults). Results showed that most antibiotics present in raw milk remained in pasteurized milk and were transferred to cheese to a high extent; retention was above 50% in most cases. The minimum safety margin in pasteurized milk was obtained for enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin for the children's group. For fresh cheese, an elevated safety margin was obtained for all antibiotics and age groups considered. However, the large amounts of antibiotics retained in the cheese might contribute to the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance.

Full fatPrato cheese, Prato cheese with fat reduction and reduced fatPrato cheese with 0.5% (w/v) WPC were made, and replicated on a different day. Cheese volatile compounds were extracted by solid phase microextraction (SPME) and separated, identified and quantified by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometry detector (GC-MS). Fat reduction and the WPC addition resulted in lower concentrations of compounds derived from lipolysis and free fatty acid catabolism. Fat reduction generated higher levels of diacetyl and acetoin, both from the citrate metabolism, at days 5 and 30. A similar pattern was observed for sulfur compounds derived from the catabolism of free amino acids, at day 120. Higher levels of diacetyl (day15), dimethyl disulfide (days 150-180) and dimethyl trisulphide (days 150-210) were found for cheese with WPC. These differences might have occurred due to alterations in the structure and polarity of the protein matrix caused by fat reduction and the WPC addition.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D001938', 'D002611', 'D005223', 'D005511', 'D008401', 'D052617', 'D013457', 'D055549', 'D000067796', 'D000067816']","['Brazil', 'Cheese', 'Fats', 'Food Handling', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Whey', 'Whey Proteins']",Fat reduction and whey protein concentrate addition alter the concentration of volatile compounds during Prato cheese ripening.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30884718,2020

High exposure to these metals can result in adverse health effects such as neurodegenerative diseases. In non-occupationally exposed subjects, diet is the primary source of exposure. In this study, we aimed at estimating dietary aluminum and tin intake in an Italian adult population. We measured aluminum and tin concentrations through inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry in 908 food samples. We also estimated dietary intake of these two metals, by using a validated semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire administered to 719 subjects (319 men and 400 women) recruited from the general population of the Emilia Romagna region, Northern Italy. We found the highest aluminum levels in legumes, sweets, and cereals, while the highest tin levels were in sweets, meat and seafood. The estimated median daily dietary intake of aluminum was 4.1 mg/day (Interquartile range - IQR: 3.3-5.2), with a major contribution from beverages (28.6%), cereals (16.9%), and leafy vegetables (15.2%). As for tin, we estimated a median intake of 66.8 μg/day (IQR: 46.7-93.7), with a major contribution from vegetables (mainly tomatoes) (24.9%), fruit (15.5%), aged cheese (12.2%), and processed meat (10.4%).

In the EU, PR57:1 is permitted in cosmetics and also as a food additive (E180) for colouring edible cheese rinds. The USFDA batch-certifies R6, R7, and their lakes in accordance with limiting specifications for impurities stated in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In the current work, an impurity not specified in the CFR was studied because of its consistent presence in samples of R6 and R7 submitted for certification. Using spectroscopic methods, the impurity was tentatively identified as 4-[(4-methyl-2-sulfophenyl)azo]-3-naphthalenol (DPR57), the decarboxylated analogue of PR57 and PR57:1. Its identity was confirmed by synthesising DPR57 and determining that the UHPLC retention time, UV/visible spectrum and mass spectrum of the synthetic material were identical to those of the impurity. Using the synthesised DPR57 as a reference material, the impurity was quantified in 43 batches of R6, R7, and lakes produced by eight different manufacturers. Calibration curves ranging from 0.02% to 1.00% (w/w) were prepared by plotting the UHPLC area of DPR57 at 485 nm against its concentration. DPR57 levels ranged from < 0.02% to 0.50%. To facilitate dissolution of the color additive samples for DPR57 analysis, a relatively simple procedure was developed by adapting a previously published method that involves use of a basic solution of the chelating agent EDTA and the organic solvent N,N'-dimethylformamide.

30415846,"Undesired browning of Parmesan cheese can occur during the latter period of ripening and cold storage despite the relative absence of reducing sugars and high temperatures typically associated with Maillard browning. Highly reactive α-dicarbonyls such as methylglyoxal (MG) are products and accelerants of Maillard browning chemistry and can result from the microbial metabolism of sugars and AA by lactic acid bacteria. We demonstrate the effects of microbially produced MG in a model Parmesan cheese extract using a strain of Lactobacillus casei 12A engineered for inducible overexpression of MG synthase (mgsA) from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum HG-8. Maximum induction of plasmid-born mgsA led to 1.6 mM MG formation in Parmesan cheese extract and its distinct discoloration. The accumulation of heterocyclic amines including β-carboline derivatives arising from mgsA expression were determined by mass spectrometry. Potential MG-contributing reaction mechanisms for the formation of heterocyclic amines are proposed. These findings implicate nonstarter lactic acid bacteria may cause browning and influence nutritional aspects of Parmesan by enzymatic conversion of triosephosphates to MG. Moreover, these findings indicate that the microbial production of MG can lead to the formation of late-stage Maillard reaction products such as melanoidin and β-carbolines, effectively circumventing the thermal requirement of the early- and intermediate- stage Maillard reaction. Therefore, the identification and control of offending microbiota may prevent late-stage browning of Parmesan.

However, environmental impacts from land degradation, odour and dust have prevented the construction of further evaporation ponds in some areas of Australia. The survey results also show that disposal to municipal trade waste is not always effective, as the current levels of some salinity-related parameters are significantly higher than the levels allowed by the local water/environmental authorities.

The use of β-CD in food research for reduction of cholesterol is increasing due to its affinity for non-polar molecules such as cholesterol. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using β-CD in cholesterol removal from pasteurized ewe's milk Manchego cheese and evaluate the effect on the main components of the milk, lipids, and flavor characteristics. Approximately 97.6% cholesterol reduction was observed in the cheese that was treated using β-CD. Physicochemical properties (fat, moisture and protein) were not changed by the β-CD treatment, except the soluble nitrogen and non-protein nitrogen that showed slight differences after the treatment. The amount of the different components of the lipid fraction (fatty acids, triglycerides and phospholipids) were similar in cheeses treated and not treated with β-CD. Flavor compound and short chain free fatty acids were not mostly significantly influenced by the effect of the β-CD. β-CD molecules are edible and nontoxic and as a result they can be used safely for cholesterol removal processing in cheese manufacturing.

29785912,"The hypothesis of this research paper was that the physicochemical conditions in a low-pH, high-moisture white brined cheese such as Feta would make para-κ-casein vulnerable to residual chymosin activity during ripening and storage. It was important to address this hypothesis, since cheese para-κ-casein could theoretically be used for the assessment of the origin of cheese milk by means of various analytical methods. Feta cheese was manufactured from sheep milk and from four different mixtures of sheep and goat milk in triplicate. The para-κ-casein of Feta samples taken during 120 d of ripening and storage was estimated by means of cation-exchange HPLC and proteolysis was determined in terms of free amino groups. Despite their similarity, sheep and goat para-κ-casein were efficiently separated and the changes of their chromatographic areas indicated that hydrolysis took place during the first stage of ripening. In accordance to the evolution of free amino groups, para-κ-caseins remained stable thereafter. The hydrolysis pattern was not affected by the composition of the cheese milk mixture and after 120 d at least two thirds of the initial quantity remained intact.

29746108,"Adulteration of Mozzarella di Bufala Campana with cow milk is a common fraud because of the high price and limited seasonal availability of water buffalo milk. To identify such adulteration, this work proposes a novel approach based on the use of species-specific, low-molecular-weight biomarkers (LMWBs). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry screening analyses identified β-carotene, lutein, and β-cryptoxanthin as LMWBs of cow milk, while ergocalciferol was found only in water buffalo milk. Adulterated mozzarellas were prepared in the laboratory and analyzed for the four biomarkers. Combined quantification of β-carotene and ergocalciferol enabled the detection of cow milk with a sensitivity threshold of 5% (w/w). The method was further tested by analyzing a certificated water buffalo mozzarella and several commercial products.

Nevertheless, it has recently been detected in cheese, as metabolically active cells, in advanced ripening stages. In this study, we assessed the viability of L. lactis subsp. lactis in model cheeses up to 180 days of ripening by both culture-dependent and -independent methods. In addition, we studied the expression of metC and als genes involved in the production of aroma compounds detected by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Three L. lactis subsp. lactis commercial starters were inoculated in pasteurized milk and model cheeses were manufactured and ripened for six months. Samples were analysed at manufacturing and ripening steps, in terms of viability of L. lactis by both traditional plating and direct analysis of RNA by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and in terms of aroma profile by GC-MS. Relatively to RT-qPCR analysis, L. lactis was found viable throughout the whole process of cheesemaking and aging, with final average loads of 3-4 Log CFU/g at 180 days. On the contrary, the microorganism was not detected, in ripened samples, by traditional plating on M17 medium, suggesting its entering in a viable but not cultivable (VBNC) state. The aroma profiles of the cheeses highlighted the presence of volatile compounds related to cheese flavor as acetoin, diacetyl, 2,3-butanediol and dimethyl disulfide, whose presence was partially correlated to metC and als genes expression.

In this paper, the interaction of isorenieratene with human serum albumin (HSA) was explored and compared with that of nonaromatic carotenoids using multi-spectroscopic methods and docking simulations. The results suggested isorenieratene could bind to HSA through a static quenching mechanism. The binding processes were spontaneous and exothermic, and the binding between isorenieratene and HSA was mainly driven by hydrophobic forces and electrostatic attraction. Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) experiments showed isorenieratene may change the secondary structure of HSA and the micro-environment of its amino acids.

29571305,"A new method for determination of underivatized biogenic amines in cheese based on ion exchange chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometric detection was proposed. The method was applied to the analysis of 10 biogenic amines (trimethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, 2-phenylethylamine, spermine, spermidine, tryptamine, agmatine, and tyramine) in different types of cheese. The amines were extracted only with water without any additional derivatization step or sample cleanup. This is a great advantage in terms of simplicity of sample pretreatment procedure compared with other currently existing methods in the literature. Biogenic amines were separated using cation exchange column, under gradient elution conditions by mixing formic acid (1.00 M) and deionized water. Detection was achieved using tandem MS/MS, with the instrument set into multiple reaction monitoring mode to ensure high specificity. The detection and quantification limits were in the ranges of 12-46 μg/L and 40-153 μg/L, respectively. The exceptions were spermidine and spermine, with detection limits of 0.8 and 5.4 mg/L, respectively. The linearity for most of the biogenic amines was from 10 μg/L up to 10 mg/L. The best recoveries were observed for trimethylamine, tyramine, and cadaverine, and were 89, 94, and 102%, respectively. The results showed that this method can be used for routine determination of biogenic amines in different types of cheeses as well other food matrices.

It is essential for major biological functions such as protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism, the maintenance of the central nervous system, and the formation of red blood cells. Since mammals cannot synthesize cobalamin, dietary intake represents the only natural source for humans. Dairy products can provide significant levels of cobalamin; moreover, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) panel has set the recommended intake at 4 μg/day for adults. Vitamin B12 content was determined in milk and several matrices related to the process of transformation of the residual whey from Parmigiano Reggiano cheese-making to obtain ricotta cheese. In addition, vitamin B12 degradation during ricotta cheese shelf-life was studied. The analyses were performed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results show that vitamin B12 amount in ricotta from dairy and experimental cheese-making brings respectively 1/8 to 1/4 of the adequate intake in adults established by EFSA. In addition, shelf-life experiment shows that cobalamine is fairly rapidly degraded in ricotta: light effect seems to be significant, even if the light exposure is short.

29433268,"Cheese is a typical handcrafted fermented food in Kazak minority from the Uighur Autonomy Region in China. The ripening process of the cheese is crucial for quality and flavor. The aim of this study was to gain a deeper knowledge on the bacterial and fungal community diversity at different time points during the post-ripening of the cheese and to understand the relationship between bacterial and fungal profiles and the chemical components including amino acids, fatty acids and volatile compounds related the cheese flavor. Cheese samples were collected from days 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 after the starting point of post-ripening. The bacterial and fungal compositions were analyzed with next generation sequencing targeting the 16S rDNA loci for bacteria and ITS loci for fungi. The amino acids contents were analyzed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography combined with UV detection. The fatty acids and the volatile components were analyzed by Solid Phase Micro Extraction followed by Gas Chromatography/Mass spectrometry. We found that Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Kluyveromyces and Torulaspora were the dominant cheese's population. Bidirectional orthogonal partial least squares (O2PLS) based correlation analysis between microbiota succession and flavor dynamics showed that bacteria made more contributions to flavor formation than fungi. Eight bacteria genera and seven fungi genera were determined as functional core microbiota for the flavor production based on their dominance and functionality in microbial community. This study provided a comprehensive picture of the dynamic changes of microbiota profiles through the post-ripening process. The elucidation of the causal relationship between microbiota and the flavor components has advanced our understanding of the mechanism underlying the cheese development.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000596', 'D001419', 'D002611', 'D056148', 'D005227', 'D005285', 'D005511', 'D005516', 'D005658', 'D008401', 'D009812', 'D021521', 'D052616', 'D013056', 'D013649', 'D013997', 'D055549']","['Amino Acids', 'Bacteria', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Reverse-Phase', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fermentation', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fungi', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Odorants', 'Ribotyping', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Taste', 'Time Factors', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Dynamic correlations between microbiota succession and flavor development involved in the ripening of Kazak artisanal cheese.,"['Q000378', 'Q000235', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378']","['metabolism', 'genetics', 'microbiology', None, 'metabolism', None, 'methods', 'methods', 'genetics', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433268,2019

The analysis of the molecular structure of cheeses was investigated by MIR spectroscopy coupled with ICA (Independent Components Analysis) and rheological properties by small-amplitude oscillatory rheology. ICA on physicochemical characteristics showed a good discrimination of the cheeses as a function of their chemical characteristics and ripening time. ICA applied to MIR spectra gave Independent Components (ICs) that were attributed to the molecular characteristics of protein, water and fat. Signal proportions of each IC depicted information regarding changes in those ICs with salts, heating and ripening. In addition, similar fat melting temperatures were obtained, regardless the technique used (oscillatory rheology and MIR) for all cheeses. This study demonstrated that MIR spectroscopy coupled with ICA is a promising tool to monitor and characterize modification of cheeses at a molecular level depending on temperature, salt content, and ripening time.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D002611', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D012965', 'D013055']","['Cheese', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared']","Delineation of salts, ripening and gentle heating effects on molecular structure of Cantal-type cheese by Mid-infrared spectroscopy.","['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433210,2019

In the present study, we identified galactose as a limiting factor for the browning, and clarified the involvement of the Maillard reaction for the discoloration. A precursor of browning of Cheddar cheese was isolated by procedures of solvent extraction and chromatography. D-Galactose and D-lactose were identified as a precursor of browning of Cheddar cheese A and B, respectively. Cheddar cheese (A, B, and C), sugar-added cheese, and nine kinds of retail cheese were stored at 4 to 70ºC for 0 to 10 d, before the L*-, a*-, and b*-values and sugar contents of each sample were measured. Cheese to which galactose was added turned brown more intensively during storage than the non-added control and the other sugar-added cheese. The more galactose was added, the more intensive the browning of the cheese appeared. The decrease in galactose correlated with the ΔL*-, Δa*-, Δb*-, and ΔE-values indicating the browning or discoloration of cheese samples. The decrease in sugars of nine kinds of retail cheese during storage also correlated with the ΔL*-, Δa*-, and ΔE-values of these cheese samples. These results clearly indicate that sugars, especially galactose, in cheese are an important factor for the browning of cheese during storage.

29324088,"For many years, the adulteration of milk from sheep, goats or water buffalos with cows' milk has been a widespread practice due to the higher cost of milk from those other species. Because of this, great concern has been shown by many Protected Designation of Origin councils that have to assure the quality and genuineness of the cheese produced by their associates. Therefore, the whole production chain needs analytical tools that allow the control of potential adulteration. Rapid methods to be used in the field are scarce and have not been validated according to international guidelines. The aim of this work has been to validate a rapid test based on lateral flow immunochromatography to detect cows' milk in milk from other species, including buffalo's milk, according to AOAC guidelines. No false-positive result was found after analysing 146 known negative samples from individual animals. The lowest level of adulteration with a Probability of Detection (POD) of 1.00 (confidence interval between 0.94 and 1.00) was found at 0.5% of cows' milk. This level is below the current EU allowed level of cows' milk, set at 1%. Variations in the time of assay, volume of the analysis buffer and different batches of the test were evaluated to detect any effect on the false-positive rate or on the limit of detection of the test. The effects of compositional factors (such as high level of fat, protein and somatic cell counts) were also evaluated. The new rapid test to detect cows' milk in milk from other species is shown to be an adequate tool to control milk quality in routine analysis. This kind of test is very easy to use and it can be performed by untrained staff during milk collection at the farm or upon arrival at dairies.","Food additives & contaminants.

Volatile compounds were extracted by solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-olfactometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Composition analyses included pH, proximate analysis, salt content, organic acid analysis by HPLC, and color. Flavor and texture properties were determined by descriptive sensory analysis. Focus groups were conducted to document US consumer perception followed by consumer acceptance testing (n = 149) with selected cheeses. Ninety aroma-active compounds in Gouda cheeses were detected by solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-olfactometry. Key aroma-active volatile compounds included diacetyl, 2- and 3-methylbutanal, 2-methylpropanal, methional, ethyl butyrate, acetic acid, butyric acid, homofuraneol, δ-decalactone, and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine.

A total of 183 composite food samples were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS techniques for the presence of HFRs. The analyses revealed that 72% of the samples was contaminated with HFRs to some extent. The highest number of contaminated samples was observed within the group 'Potatoes and derived products', 'Fish and fish products' and 'Meat and meat products', while the least contaminated group was 'Food for infants and small children'. The total HFR content ranged from <LOQ to 35.4 ng/g ww with an average content of 1.2 ng/g ww and median of 0.25 ng/g ww. The samples with the highest total HFR levels were canned king crab, fresh mackerel, Emmental cheese, fresh eel and plaice. The most frequently detected HFRs were PBDEs and BrPhs being present in almost all food groups, and among the individual HFRs, the most frequently found compounds were BDE-47 (53%), BDE-209 (46%) and 246-TBP (40%).

In this study, the microstructure and physicochemical properties of both laboratory and commercially produced high moisture buffalo Mozzarella cheeses were investigated and compared to high moisture bovine products. Buffalo and bovine Mozzarella cheeses were found to significantly differ in their microstructure, chemical composition, organic acid and proteolytic profiles but had similar hardness and meltability. The buffalo cheeses exhibited a significantly higher ratio of fat to protein and a microstructure containing larger fat patches and a less dense protein network. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry detected the presence of only β-casein variant A2 and a single β-lactoglobulin variant in buffalo products compared to the presence of both β-casein variants A1 and A2 and β-lactoglobulin variants A and B in bovine cheese. These differences arise from the different milk composition and processing conditions.

29087807,"Milk is an important and beneficial food from a nutritional point of view, being an indispensable source of high quality proteins. Furthermore, it is a raw material for many dairy products, such as yoghurt, cheese, cream etc. Before reaching consumers, milk goes through production, processing and circulation. Each step involves potentially unsafe factors, such as chemical contamination that can affect milk quality. Antibiotics are widely used in veterinary medicine for dry cow therapy and mastitis treatment in lactating cows, which can cause the presence of antimicrobial residues in milk. In order to ensure consumers' safety, milk is analyzed to make sure that the fixed Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for antibiotics are not exceeded. Multiclass methods can monitor more drug classes through a single analysis, so they are faster, less time-consuming and cheaper than traditional methods (single-class); this aspect is particularly important for milk, which is a highly perishable food. Nevertheless, multiclass methods for veterinary drug residues in foodstuffs are real analytical challenges. This article reviews the major multiclass methods published for the determination of antibiotic residues in milk by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, with a special focus on sample preparation approaches.","Food additives & contaminants.

It is well known that the strains largely involved in the aroma formation of the very appreciated Italian long ripened cheeses belong to the Lactobacillus casei group and origin from raw milk. In this study, a spontaneous fermentation of Parmigiano Reggiano raw milks was carried out to isolate new strains potentially usable as adjunctive aromatic starter. For this reason, specific selection criteria were chosen to isolate strains belonging to L. casei, and L. paracasei species. An integrated approach, by mean of impedance microbiology and SPME GC-MS analysis, was applied to investigate the acidifying performance and the production of volatile compounds of seven strains in UHT whole milk. One of these strains, L. paracasei 4341, appear to be the most interesting one from the technological point of view both for its acidifying and aromatic features.

Samples were collected during 7 cheese- and ricotta-making procedures carried out at 2-week intervals from bulk milk to study possible differences in the transfer and modification of FA. Compared with morning milk, evening milk had fewer de novo synthetised FA. The detailed FA profile of partially skimmed milk differed little from that of evening whole milk before skimming, but the cream obtained differed from partially skimmed milk and from fresh cheese in about half the FA, due mainly to higher contents of all de novo FA, and lower contents of n-3 and n-6 FA. Fresh cheese and whey had similar FA profiles. The ricotta manufacturing process affected the partition of FA between ricotta and scotta, the FA profile of the latter differing in terms of groups and individual FA from the former, whereas ricotta and fresh cheese had similar composition of FA.

In addition to a control (whey with norbixin, whey from cheese milk with an alternative colorant (AltC) was evaluated. The control and AltC wheys were also heated to 50°C for 1 h. Wheys were concentrated to 80% protein by ultrafiltration and spray dried. The experiment was replicated in triplicate. Samples were taken after initial milk pasteurization, initial whey formation, after fat separation, after whey pasteurization, after bleaching, and after spray drying for vitamin and carotenoid analyses. Concentrations of retinol, a-tocopherol, water-soluble vitamins, norbixin, and other carotenoids were determined by HPLC, and volatile compounds were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sensory attributes of the rehydrated WPC80 were documented by a trained panel. After chemical or enzymatic bleaching, WPC80 displayed 7.0 to 33.3% reductions in retinol, β-carotene, ascorbic acid, thiamin, α-carotene, and α-tocopherol.

It is produced in seven municipalities in the state of Minas Gerais in a region called Serra da Canastra. In this work, samples of milk, ""pingo"" (natural starter), whey and Canastra cheese were collected on a farm in Medeiros-MG/Brazil to evaluate the yeast microbiota and select yeasts for whey fermentation to produce ethanol and volatile aromatic compounds of relevance in the production of cheese. Thirty-nine isolates capable of fermenting lactose in a synthetic medium were identified by MALDI-TOF as Kluyveromyces lactis (29), Torulaspora delbrueckii (7) and Candida intermedia (3). Eleven isolates of K. lactis and three of T. delbrueckii efficiently fermented lactose until 4th day, and due to this reason were selected for cheese whey fermentation with Brix 12, 14 and 18. Generally, the isolates T. delbrueckii B14, B35, and B20 and K. lactis B10 were the most effective regardless of the initial Brix value. The identification of these four isolates by MALDI TOF was confirmed by sequencing of the ITS region. In the fermentation of cheese whey 14 Brix, T. delbrueckii B14 and B35, respectively yielded 24.06g/L and 16.45g/L of ethanol, while K. lactis B10 was more efficient in the consumption of lactose. In sequential culture with K. lactis B10 inoculated 48h after T. delbrueckii B14, 97.82% of the total sugars were consumed resulting in the production of 19.81g/L ethanol and 39 aromatic volatile compounds. The most abundant compounds were 3-methyl-1-butanol, octanoic acid and ethyl decanoate, which are reported as important for the aroma and flavor of cheeses. Based in our results, B10 isolate inoculated 48h after B14 isolate is a promising yeast inoculum to be used for fermentation of dairy substrates.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D001938', 'D002210', 'D002611', 'D003651', 'D005285', 'D005511', 'D005516', 'D007716', 'D007785', 'D009812', 'D000439', 'D019032', 'D013649', 'D055319', 'D055549', 'D000067796', 'D015003']","['Brazil', 'Caprylates', 'Cheese', 'Decanoates', 'Fermentation', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'Kluyveromyces', 'Lactose', 'Odorants', 'Pentanols', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Taste', 'Torulaspora', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Whey', 'Yeasts']",Yeasts from Canastra cheese production process: Isolation and evaluation of their potential for cheese whey fermentation.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000382', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000382', 'Q000145']","[None, 'metabolism', 'microbiology', 'metabolism', None, 'methods', 'methods', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'microbiology', 'classification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28290329,2019

Previous work has shown that these permeates contribute to salty taste without contributing significantly to sodium content. The objective of this study was to explore the sensory characteristics and compositional analysis of permeates from different milk and whey streams and a low-sodium product application made from them. Skim milk, Cheddar, cottage, and Mozzarella cheese whey permeates were manufactured in triplicate, and delactosed whey permeate was obtained in triplicate. Composition (protein, fat, solids, minerals) was conducted on permeates. Organic acid composition was determined using HPLC. Volatile compounds were extracted from permeates by solid phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A trained sensory panel documented sensory attributes of permeates and cream of broccoli soups with and without salt or permeates followed by consumer acceptance testing (n=105) on the soups. Cottage cheese whey permeate contained a higher lactic acid content than other permeates, which has been shown to contribute to a higher salty taste. Cottage cheese whey permeate also contained potato or brothy and caramel flavors and sour and salty tastes, whereas delactosed whey permeate had high intensities of cardboard and beefy or brothy flavors and salty taste. Milk, Cheddar, and Mozzarella cheese whey permeates were characterized by sweet taste and cooked milky flavor. Permeates with higher cardboard flavor had higher levels of aldehydes. All permeates contributed to salty taste and to salty taste perception in soups; although the control soup with added salt was perceived as saltier and was preferred by consumers over permeate soups. Soup with permeate from cottage cheese was the least liked of all soups, likely due to its sour taste. All other permeate soups scored at parity for liking.

27489951,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous food-borne pathogen, and its presence in food or production facilities highlights the importance of surveillance. Increased understanding of the surface exposed antigens on Listeria would provide potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. In the present work, using mass spectrometry and genetic cloning, we show that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) class II in Listeria species is the antigen target of the previously described mAb-3F8. Western and dot blot assays confirmed that the mAb-3F8 could distinguish all tested Listeria species from close-related bacteria. Localization studies indicated that FBA is present in every fraction of Listeria cells, including supernatant and the cell wall, setting Listeria spp. as one of the few bacteria described to have this protein on their cell surface. Epitope mapping using ORFeome display and a peptide membrane revealed a 14-amino acid peptide as the potential mAb-3F8 epitope. The target epitope in FBA allowed distinguishing Listeria spp. from closely-related bacteria, and was identified as part of the active site in the dimeric enzyme. However, its function in cell surface seems not to be host cell adhesion-related. Western and dot blot assays further demonstrated that mAb-3F8 together with anti-InlA mAb-2D12 could differentiate pathogenic from non-pathogenic Listeria isolated from artificially contaminated cheese. In summary, we report FBA as a novel immunogenic surface target useful for the detection of Listeria genus.

In the plate, a chameleon dye (Py-1) is embedded in a polymeric cocktail which is deposited on the bottom of the wells in a common microtiterplate. On reaction with biogenic amines (BAs), the fluorescence of Py-1 at 620 nm rapidly delivers a precise TAC. After 10 min incubation at 25 °C the determination of the TAC in various (real) samples is possible in high-throughput with a standard microplate reader. The optimized fluorescence method was validated for linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision (intraday and inter day repeatability) and recovery using histamine (HIS) as a representative BA. The sensor microtiterplate was successfully applied to quantitatively analyze the TAC in 10 real samples of cheese and meat obtained from various Egyptian markets. The TAC of these real samples obtained by the sensor microtiterplate was validated against the contents of BAs obtained by GC-MS at various times of storage.

Forty compounds including esters (12), acids (6), ketones (9), alcohols (3), and miscellaneous compounds (10) were identified. The main classes of volatile components in the cheeses are esters, miscellaneous compounds, and ketones. The type and concentration of the coagulants influenced both volatile composition and sensory scores of the cheeses. Principal component analysis separated the cheeses based on the use of 2 coagulants in various combinations and ripening time. The cheeses produced using higher concentrations of R. miehei were separately located on the plot compared with the cheeses produced using higher concentrations of camel chymosin. Sensory evaluation of the cheeses showed that, in general, the cheeses produced using higher concentrations of camel chymosin received higher body and texture and odor and flavor scores than the cheese produced using higher concentrations of R. miehei.

CN in complex mixtures were digested with trypsin, and peptide fragments were subsequently identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The unique presence of a β-CN A variant and an internally deleted αs1-CN (f35-42) variant in international WB milk samples was ascertained by identifying signature tryptic peptides from either dephosphorylated or native CN. Four signature unphosphorylated peptides derived from β-CN A, i.e. (f49-68) Asn(68) (2223.6 Da), (f1-28) Ser(10) (3169.4 Da), (f1-29) Ser(10) (3297.4 Da) and (f33-48) Thr(41) (1982 Da) and two from αs1-CN (f35-42) deleted fragments, i.e. (f23-34) Met(31) (1415.7 Da) and (f43-58) Val(44) (1752.7 Da), were identified. Two signature casein phosphopeptides (CPPs), i.e. β-CN (f1-28) 4P (3489.1 Da) and β-CN (f33-48) 1P (2062.0 Da), were identified in the tryptic hydrolysate of native casein or curd and cheese samples using in-batch hydroxyapatite (HA) chromatography. All these fragments functioned as analytical surrogates of two αs1- and β-casein variants that specifically occur in the milk of international WB breeds. Furthermore, the bovine peptide β-CN (f1-28) 4P had a distinct and lower molecular mass compared with the WB counterpart and functioned as a species-specific marker for all breeds of WB. Advantages of this analytical approach are that (i) peptides are easier to separate than proteins, (ii) signature peptide probes originating from specific casein variants allow for the targeting of all international WB milk, curd and cheese samples and (iii) bovine and WB casein in mixtures can be simultaneously determined in protected designation of origin (PDO) ""Mozzarella di Bufala Campana"" cheese.

The volatile compounds were extracted and analyzed by SPME-GC-MS and cheese odour and aroma profiles were studied by descriptive sensory analysis. Control cheese was made only with a mesophilic starter and experimental cheeses with L. reuteri were made with and without glycerol. The addition of L. reuteri INIA P572 to milk enhanced the formation of six volatile compounds.

On the other hand, the addition of L. reuteri INIA P572 coupled with 30mM glycerol enhanced the formation of twelve volatile compounds, but decreased the formation of five ones. The use of the biopreservation system did not affect overall odour and aroma quality of cheese although it resulted in a significant decrease of the odour intensity scores.

The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) values obtained were 6μgkg(-)(1) and 18μgkg(-)(1), respectively. The mean recovery range obtained for all food at a fortification level of 200μgkg(-)(1) was 85-110%. Accuracy was evaluated using dogfish liver certified reference material (DOLT-3 NRC) for trace metals. The highest total arsenic concentrations (in μgkg(-)(1)) were found in fish (152-439), rice (87-316) and rice-based products (52-201). The contribution to inorganic arsenic (i-As) intake was calculated from the mean i-As content of each food (calculated by applying conversion factors to total arsenic data) and the mean consumption per day. The primary contributors to inorganic arsenic intake were wheat flour, including its proportion in wheat flour-based products (breads, pasta and cookies), followed by rice; both foods account for close to 53% and 17% of the intake, respectively.

27133588,"Cyclopropane fatty acids (CPFA), as lactobacillic acid and dihydrosterculic acid, are components of bacterial membranes and have been recently detected in milk and in dairy products from cows fed with corn silage. In this paper, a specific quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for the detection of CPFA in cheeses was developed, and the quality parameters of the method (limit of detection, limit of quantitation, and intralaboratory precision) were assessed. Limit of detection and quantitation of CPFA were, respectively, 60 and 200 mg/kg of cheese fat, and the intralaboratory precision, determined on three concentration levels, satisfied the Horwitz equation. This method was applied to 304 samples of PDO cheeses of certified origin, including Parmigiano Reggiano (Italy), Grana Padano (Italy), Fontina (Italy), Comté (France), and Gruyère (Switzerland). Results showed that CPFA were absent in all of the cheeses whose Production Specification Rules expressly forbid the use of silages (Parmigiano Reggiano, Fontina, Comté, and Gruyère). CPFA were instead present in variable concentrations (300-830 mg/kg of fat) in all of the samples of Grana Padano cheese (silages admitted). A mix of grated Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano was also prepared, showing that the method is able to detect the counterfeiting of Parmigiano Reggiano with other cheeses up to 10-20% Grana Padano content. These results support the hypothesis that CPFA can be used as a marker of silage feedings for cheeses, and the data reported can be considered a first attempt to create a database for CPFA presence in PDO cheeses.

26992495,"Sterols/oxysterols in food may be free or bound i.e. esterified with fatty acids. Methods commonly applied to determine those compounds in such matrices (based on various analytical techniques) usually start with hydrolysis of the food lipid fraction, which means that the results are no good indication of concentration of free sterols/oxysterols only. But only free oxysterols are proatherogenic factors, bound ones are not. There are some published methods selectively sensitive to free oxysterols only, but they are capable to determine only a few compounds and feature very low recovery rates. The aim of this work was to develop a method to determine various free (non-esterified) sterols/oxysterols in various food matrices. The developed method is based on the GC-IT-MS technique used in the chemical ionization mode. It was applied to determine 16 different free sterols/oxysterols in egg powder, cheese, butter, milk and salami. Fat extracted from the given matrix is purified on a specially prepared silica-gel bed to separate the sterol fraction from the oxysterol one. Sterols are silylated using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and trimethylchlorosilane BSTFA:TMCS, then GC-IT-MS analysed. The method features high recovery rates (75-95%), high reproducibility (RSD<20%), and sensitivity within the 0.01-0.3 mg 100 g(-1) range, depending on the analysed compound. The method is ideally suited for determination of free sterols/oxysterols.

The detector response was linear from 0.002 to 8 mg/L 8 (R(2) > 0.999). Low LOD and LOQ values of 1 and 2 μg/L, respectively, reflected the high sensitivity of the method. The intra- and interday recoveries of the 8-spiked cheese samples ranged between 87.7 and 102.6%.

26911915,"Traditional cheeses harbour complex microbial consortia that play an important role in shaping typical sensorial properties. However, the microbial metabolism is considered difficult to control. Microbial community succession and the related gene expression were analysed during ripening of a traditional Italian cheese, identifying parameters that could be modified to accelerate ripening. Afterwards, we modulated ripening conditions and observed consistent changes in microbial community structure and function. We provide concrete evidence of the essential contribution of non-starter lactic acid bacteria in ripening-related activities. An increase in the ripening temperature promoted the expression of genes related to proteolysis, lipolysis and amino acid/lipid catabolism and significantly increases the cheese maturation rate. Moreover, temperature-promoted microbial metabolisms were consistent with the metabolomic profiles of proteins and volatile organic compounds in the cheese. The results clearly indicate how processing-driven microbiome responses can be modulated in order to optimize production efficiency and product quality.

26910555,"Mozzarella di Bufala Campana is a soft, stretched curd Italian cheese made from fresh buffalo milk that obtained the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) registration in EU legislation. Seasonality of buffalo milk production, rapid cheese decay and transport of its preserving liquid have relevant practical/economic consequences for mozzarella production; consequently, a progressive diffusion of cheese products realized with frozen curd or frozen milk has recently been observed. In order to meet the demand of the dairy producers and consumers for a reduction of starting material adulterations and for the certification of the raw milk used for cheese manufacturing, we have developed a rapid/robust MALDI-TOF-MS polypeptide profiling procedure that assays material quality through the identification of specific markers of its freshness. Massive analysis of fresh and frozen buffalo milks (stored for different times) was realized to this purpose; a tough statistical evaluation of the resulting data ultimately permitted the typing of milk samples. We identified 28 polypeptide markers of the milk freezing storage, among which 13 and 15 showed down- and over-representation, respectively. Quantitative data were confirmed by an independent analytical approach on selected markers. GLYCAM1-derived phosphopeptides (1-53), β-casein-derived phosphopeptides (1-68), β-casein-derived γ2-, γ3- and γ4-fragments, α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were components showing the highest significance. The occurrence of the first compounds in buffalo milk is here described for the first time; their formation in the frozen material was ascribed to the activity of plasmin or of unknown bacterial proteases/peptidases stable at low temperatures. In conclusion, data reported here suggest the application of this MALDI-TOF-MS polypeptide profiling platform to other high-quality dairy productions, in which milk freshness has important consequences on final product organoleptic properties.",Journal of proteomics,"['D000818', 'D015415', 'D002020', 'D002611', 'D005506', 'D063427', 'D061353', 'D005615', 'D008892', 'D040901', 'D019032', 'D013997']","['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Buffaloes', 'Cheese', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Quality', 'Food Storage', 'Freezing', 'Milk', 'Proteomics', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Time Factors']",Identification of protein markers for the occurrence of defrosted material in milk through a MALDI-TOF-MS profiling approach.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'adverse effects', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26910555,2017

It was decided to merge the two activities after the agreement signed between ISO and AOAC in June 2012 to develop common standards and to avoid duplicate work. The collaborative study was performed after having provided highly satisfactory single-laboratory validation results [Golay, P.A., & Dong, Y. (2015) J. AOAC Int. 98, 1679-1696] that exceeded the performance criteria defined in AOAC Standard Method Performance Requirement (SMPR(®)) 2012.011 (September 29, 2012) on 12 products selected by the AOAC Stakeholder Panel on Infant Formula (SPIFAN). After a qualification period of 1 month, 18 laboratories participated in the fatty acids analysis of 12 different samples in duplicate. Six samples were selected to meet AOAC SPIFAN requirements (i.e., infant formula and adult nutritionals in powder and liquid formats), and the other Six samples were selected to meet ISO-IDF requirements (i.e., dairy products such as milk powder, liquid milk, cream, butter, infant formula with milk, and cheese). The fatty acids were analyzed directly in all samples without preliminary fat extraction, except in one sample (cheese). Powdered samples were analyzed after dissolution (i.e., reconstitution) in water, whereas liquid samples (or extracted fat) were analyzed directly. After addition of the internal standards solution [C11:0 fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and C13:0 triacylglycerols (TAG)] to the samples, fatty acids attached to lipids were transformed into FAMEs by direct transesterification using methanolic sodium methoxide. FAMEs were separated using highly polar capillary GLC and were identified by comparison with the retention times of pure analytical standards. Quantification of fatty acids was done relative to C11:0 FAME as internal standard and to instrument response factors (determined separately using calibration standards mixture). The performance of the method (i.e., transesterification) was monitored in all samples using the second internal standard, C13:0 TAG. RSDR values were summarized separately for labeled fatty acids in SPIFAN materials and ISO-IDF materials due to different expression of results. This method was applied to representative dairy, infant formula, and adult/pediatric nutritional products and demonstrated global acceptable reproducibility precision for all fatty acids analyzed (i.e., 46 individuals and/or groups) for these categories of products.

26830750,"Cheese-whey, a major co-product of the dairy industry, has recently been the subject of many technological applications. We studied the bioconversion of whey into valuable bio-products such as a potential lactulose prebiotic and compounds with antioxidant properties. This paper examines efficiency, safety, and economics of electro-activation as an eco-friendly technology for a maximum valorization of whey. Thus, a bottom-up approach was therefore addressed. The effect of 4 experimental parameters--low working temperatures (0, 10, and 25 °C), current intensities (400, 600, and 800 mA), volume conditions (100, 200, and 300 mL), and feed concentrations [7, 14, and 28% (wt/vol)]--on lactose-whey isomerization to lactulose under electro-activation process were studied. Structural characteristics of whey proteins and antioxidant functionality were also investigated. The results showed a compromise to be reached between both parameters. Therefore, the maximum yield of 35% of lactulose was achieved after 40 min of reaction at the working temperature of 10 °C under 400 mA electric current field and 100-mL volume conditions with using feed solution at 7% (wt/vol). The isomerization of lactose to lactulose is accomplished by subsequent degradation to galactose, but only at a very small amount. Additionally, whey electro-activation showed significantly elevated antioxidant capacity compared with the untreated samples. The enhancement of antioxidant functionality of whey electro-activation resulted from the synergistic effect of its partial hydrolysis and the formation of antioxidant components that were able to scavenge free radicals.

26717969,"The conversion of parent free amino acids into alcohols by an enzymatic deamination, decarboxylation, and reduction caused by microbial enzymes was first reported more than 100 years ago and is today known as the Ehrlich pathway. Because the chiral center at the carbon bearing the methyl group in l-isoleucine should not be prone to racemization during the reaction steps, the analysis of the enantiomeric distribution in 2-methylbutanal, 2-methylbutanol, and 2-methylbutanoic acid as well as in the compounds formed by secondary reactions, such as ethyl 2-methylbutanoate and 2-methylbutyl acetate, are an appropriate measure to follow the proposed degradation mechanism in the Ehrlich reaction. On the basis of a newly developed method for quantitation and chiral analysis, the enantiomers of the five metabolites were determined in a great number of fermented foods. Whereas 2-methylbutanol occurred as pure (S)-enantiomer in nearly all samples, a ratio of almost 1:1 of (S)- and (R)-2-methylbutanal was found. These data are not in agreement with the literature suggesting the formation of 2-methylbutanol by an enzymatic reduction of 2-methylbutanal. Also, the enantiomeric distribution in 2-methylbutanoic acid was closer to that in 2-methylbutanol than to that found in 2-methylbutanal, suggesting that also the acid is probably not formed by oxidation of the aldehyde as previously proposed. Additional model studies with (S)-2-methylbutanal did not show a racemization under the conditions of food production or during workup of the sample for volatile analysis. Therefore, the results establish that different mechanisms might be responsible for the formation of aldehydes and acids from the parent amino acids in the Ehrlich pathway.

26675863,"Ricotta cheese is a typical Italian product, made with whey from various species, including cow, buffalo, sheep, and goat. Ricotta cheese nominally manufactured from the last three species may be fraudulently produced using the comparatively cheaper cow whey. Exposing such food frauds requires a reliable analytical method. Despite the extensive similarities shared by whey proteins of the four species, a mass spectrometry-based analytical method was developed that exploits three species-specific peptides derived from β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin. This method can detect as little as 0.5% bovine whey in ricotta cheese from the other three species. Furthermore, a tight correlation was found (R(2)>0.99) between cow whey percentages and mass spectrometry measurements throughout the 1-50% range. Thus, this method can be used for forensic detection of ricotta cheese adulteration and, if properly validated, to provide quantitative evaluations.

26648272,"Lactobacillus helveticus, an obligatory hetero-fermentative LAB, is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and is gaining popularity for application in dairy products. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play a remarkable role in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria in food products, without disturbing the sensory attributes of the food. In this study, the screening of the antimicrobial potential of Lactobacillus helveticus KLDS 1.8701 against four food-borne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43889 in vitro was inspected using the Oxford cup method and mixed culture inhibition assays. The organic acid production and antimicrobial potential of the cell-free supernatants (CFS) have been evaluated via different treatments and analysis using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analysis results revealed that KLDS 1.8701 exhibited the highest antimicrobial potential compared to other antimicrobial strains. The antimicrobial activity of KLDS 1.8701 resulted from the organic acids in the culture and CFS. From the study, it was found that carbon sources, as well as organic acid production, accelerate the antimicrobial activity of KLDS 1.8701 and the fructooligosaccharides (FOS) were considered the best for improving the proliferation of KLDS 1.8701 and supporting its antimicrobial action. Results of the mixed culture inhibition assays showed that part of the antimicrobial activity resulted from the inhibitory action of the bacteria itself in culture, and this action required cellular contact between the food-borne pathogens and KLDS 1.8701. Conversely, the results of the antimicrobial spectrum assay revealed that some Lactobacilli remained unaffected by KLDS 1.8701. KLDS 1.8701 might also be favorable for use as a supplementary starter in fermented dairy productions. Furthermore, KLDS 1.8701 could survive well under GI tract conditions.

Hence, it is desirable to develop easy, sensitive and fast analytical screening methods for the determination of AgNPs in complex biological matrices. This study describes such a method using solid sampling high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). A recently reported novel evaluation strategy uses the atomization delay of the respective GFAAS signal as significant indicator for AgNPs and thereby allows discrimination of AgNPs from ionic silver (Ag(+)) in the samples without elaborate sample pre-treatment. This approach was further developed and applied to a variety of biological samples. Its suitability was approved by investigation of eight different food samples (parsley, apple, pepper, cheese, onion, pasta, maize meal and wheat flour) spiked with ionic silver or AgNPs. Furthermore, the migration of AgNPs from silver-impregnated polypropylene food storage boxes to fresh pepper was observed and a mussel sample obtained from a laboratory exposure study with silver was investigated. The differences in the atomization delays (Δt(ad)) between silver ions and 20-nm AgNPs vary in a range from -2.01 ± 1.38 s for maize meal to +2.06 ± 1.08 s for mussel tissue. However, the differences were significant in all investigated matrices and so indicative of the presence/absence of AgNPs. Moreover, investigation of model matrices (cellulose, gelatine and water) gives the first indication of matrix-dependent trends.

In addition, the proteins present in buffalo cheese whey were hydrolyzed with pepsin and with different combinations of trypsin, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase-A.

The total antioxidant activities of the H1 and H2 samples with and without previous enzymatic hydrolysis, determined by DPPH using diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radical, was 4.9 and 12 mM of Trolox equivalents (TE) for H2 and H2Dint, respectively. The increased concentrations for H1 and H2 samples were approximately 99% and 75%, respectively.

The risk of utilization of semifinished products and stored milk in substitution for fresh milk is increasing, due to the continuous desire to reduce production costs. A proteomics approach and electrophoresis survey of retail mozzarella cheeses indicated different rates of proteolysis in the production of dairy industries. The use of fresh milk and correct cheesemaking protocol yielded only γ-caseins, which are derived from β-casein by plasmin, and para-κ-casein, which is derived from κ-casein by chymosin. The detection of abnormal hydrolysis resulting in β- and αS1-casein fragments, identified by mass spectrometry, indicates the use of stored milk or stored and pressed curd, or the reuse of unsold mozzarella cheese, to produce mozzarella. The formation of γ-caseins and other fragments during a long storage of raw materials at room or refrigeration temperature was ascribed to plasmin (endogenous milk enzyme), whereas formation of αS1-casein fragments, mainly αS1-I(6P)- and αS1-I(7P)-casein during the storage of curd was ascribed to the action of chymosin (exogenous enzyme) from rennet.

Functionality differences were evaluated by measurement of foam stability, protein solubility, SDS-PAGE, and effect of NaCl concentration on gelation relative to an unbleached control. HP bleached WPI had higher concentrations of lipid oxidation and sulfur containing volatile compounds than both BP and unbleached WPI (P < 0.05). HP bleached WPI was characterized by high aroma intensity, cardboard, cabbage, and fatty flavors, while BP bleached WPI was differentiated by low bitter taste. Overrun and yield stress were not different among WPI (P < 0.05). Soluble protein loss at pH 4.6 of WPI decreased by bleaching with either hydrogen peroxide or benzoyl peroxide (P < 0.05), and the heat stability of WPI was also distinct among WPI (P < 0.05). SDS PAGE results suggested that bleaching of whey with either BP or HP resulted in protein degradation, which likely contributed to functionality differences.

In this study, two innovative methods were developed, based on an enzyme-assisted (EA) extraction using proteolytic enzymes (pepsin or pepsin-pancreatin). After purification through an immunoaffinity column, AFM1 is determined by HPLC-FLD. A comparison between the new EA methods and an established chloroform (CH) method was carried out on 24 cheese samples. The results showed that the extraction efficiency of the EA methods was independent of ripening time of cheese, whereas the CH method was not able to fully recover AFM1 from ripened cheeses. The simpler (pepsin) of the two methods has been adopted by our laboratory for routine analysis of AFM1 in cheese. In comparison with the CH method, the pepsin-HCl (P-HCl) method is simpler, avoiding solvent evaporation, dissolution and partition in a separating funnel; moreover, it gives higher recoveries, comparable LOD and LOQ and more accurate results.

Their performance in a model system of an aqueous standard mixture of FFAs at a pH of 3.5 was compared to that of the more commonly used sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). All of the salts and salt systems evaluated, in proper amount, gave improved results compared to NaCl (saturated), which instead gave interesting results only for the least volatile FFAs C8 and C10. For C2-C6, the salt system that gave the best results compared to NaCl was (NH4)2SO4/NaH2PO4, in the highest of the four amounts evaluated, with factor increases between 1.2 and 4.1-fold, and NaH2PO4, between 1.0 and 4.3-fold.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the ability of mid-infrared spectroscopy to predict rennet coagulation time, curd-firming time, curd firmness at 30 and 60min after rennet addition, heat coagulation time, casein micelle size, and pH in cow milk samples, and to quantify associations between these milk technological traits and conventional milk quality traits. Samples (n=713) were collected from 605 cows from multiple herds; the samples represented multiple breeds, stages of lactation, parities, and milking times. Reference analyses were undertaken in accordance with standardized methods, and mid-infrared spectra in the range of 900 to 5,000cm(-1) were available for all samples. Prediction models were developed using partial least squares regression, and prediction accuracy was based on both cross and external validation. The proportion of variance explained by the prediction models in external validation was greatest for pH (71%), followed by rennet coagulation time (55%) and milk heat coagulation time (46%). Models to predict curd firmness 60min from rennet addition and casein micelle size, however, were poor, explaining only 25 and 13%, respectively, of the total variance in each trait within external validation. On average, all prediction models tended to be unbiased. The linear regression coefficient of the reference value on the predicted value varied from 0.17 (casein micelle size regression model) to 0.83 (pH regression model) but all differed from 1. The ratio performance deviation of 1.07 (casein micelle size prediction model) to 1.79 (pH prediction model) for all prediction models in the external validation was <2, suggesting that none of the prediction models could be used for analytical purposes. With the exception of casein micelle size and curd firmness at 60min after rennet addition, the developed prediction models may be useful as a screening method, because the concordance correlation coefficient ranged from 0.63 (heat coagulation time prediction model) to 0.84 (pH prediction model) in the external validation.

Due to its carcinogenic potential, contamination of milk and dairy products with AFM1 may pose a risk for consumers. Hence, it is considered a public health concern. In this survey, the level of AFM1 contamination of dairy products marketed in Costa Rica was determined by enzyme-assisted extraction, immunoaffinity clean-up and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescent detector (HPLC-FLD) in fluid milk (n = 70), fresh cheese (n = 70) and sour cream (n = 70) collected at local convenience stores and supermarkets.

In 30 milk samples, and 10 cheese samples, AFM1 concentrations surpassed threshold concentrations as established by the European Commission. Thus, sour cream and - to a lesser extent - cheese manufacturing seems to reduce the amount of AFM1 present in milk, possibly due to fraction redistribution or microbiological degradation.

They can grow on a large variety of food, including fruits, grains, and cheese. The amount of PAT in apple derivative products is a crucial issue because it is the measure of the quality of both the used raw products and the performed production process. Actually, all current methodologies used for the quantification of PAT are time-consuming and require skilled personnel beyond the sample pretreatment methods (e.g., high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and electrophoresis techniques). In this work, we present a novel fluorescence polarization approach based on the use of emergent near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probes. The use of these fluorophores coupled to anti-PAT antibodies makes possible the detection of PAT directly in apple juice without any sample pretreatment. This methodology is based on the increase of fluorescence polarization emission of a fluorescence-labeled PAT derivative on binding to specific antibodies. A competition between PAT and the fluorescence-labeled PAT derivative allowed detecting PAT.

It consists of: (i) the identification of the key compounds or precursors responsible for the off-flavour observed, (ii) the monitoring of these markers during the heat treatments applied to the cheese medium, (iii) the establishment of an observable reaction scheme adapted from a literature survey to the compounds identified in the heated cheese medium (iv) the multi-responses stoichiokinetic modelling of these reaction markers. Systematic two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the semi-quantitation of trace compounds. Precursors were quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The experimental data obtained were fitted to the model with 14 elementary linked reactions forming a multi-response observable reaction scheme.

25865575,"A number of direct injection mass spectrometry methods that can sample foods nondestructively and without sample preparation are being developed with applications ranging from the rapid assessment of food safety to the verification of protected designations of origin. In this pilot study, secondary electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) in positive- and negative-ion modes was used to collect volatile fingerprints of artisanal Cheddar cheeses aged for one to three years. SESI-MS fingerprints were found to change in an aging-dependent manner and can be used to descriptively and predictively categorize Cheddars by their aging period, identify volatile components that increase or decrease with aging, and robustly discriminate individual batches of artisanal cheese. From these results, it was concluded that SESI-MS volatile fingerprinting could be used by artisanal food producers to characterize their products during production and aging, providing useful data to help them maximize the value of each batch.

The results showed that 270 (67.5%) of all samples contained benzoate ranging from 11.9 to 288.5 mg kg(-1) in lactic cheese and fruit juice, respectively. The levels of sorbate in 98 (24.5%) of the samples were 20.1 to 284.3 mg kg(-1) in doogh and fruit juice, respectively. Moreover, benzoate was detected in all dairy products ranging from 11.9 mg kg(-1) in lactic cheese to 91.2 mg kg(-1) in UF-Feta cheese. A low concentration of benzoate could originate naturally, due to specific biochemical mechanisms during cheese, yogurt and doogh maturation.

As one of the PAEs family, DMP has long been a problem of great concern due to its potential impacts on human health. In order to detect DMP with high sensitivity and specificity, a sensitive indirect competitive biotin-streptavidin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BA-ELISA) has been established in this study. A high-titer rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb-DMP) targeting DMP was obtained, and the procedures of BA-ELISA were optimized for the determination of DMP in milk and milk products. Under optimal conditions, good linearity was achieved within a range of 0.024 to 6.027 μg L(-1), with low cross-reactivity values for DMP structural analogues (lower than 10%). The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.356 μg L(-1) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.0082 μg L(-1). Finally, the concentrations of DMP in milk and milk products ranged from 1.03 μg kg(-1) to 7.23 μg kg(-1) by BA-ELISA. Satisfactory recoveries (90.26-112.38%) and coefficient of variation (CV) values (5.08-8.46%) were obtained. These results were consistent with those using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which further confirmed that the proposed BA-ELISA was accurate, specific, reliable and rapid for routine monitoring trace DMP residues in foodstuff, especially milk and milk products.","Journal of environmental science and health.

25660741,"Recent studies have demonstrated the effect of bleaching conditions and bleaching agent on flavor and functional properties of whey protein ingredients. Solids concentration at bleaching significantly affected bleaching efficacy and flavor effects of different bleaching agents. It is not known if these parameters influence quality of sweet whey powder (SWP). The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of solids concentration and bleaching agent on the flavor and bleaching efficacy of SWP. Colored cheddar whey was manufactured, fat separated, and pasteurized. Subsequently, the whey (6.7% solids) was bleached, concentrated using reverse osmosis (RO) to 14% solids, and then spray dried, or whey was concentrated before bleaching and then spray dried. Bleaching treatments included a control (no bleaching, 50 °C, 60 min), hydrogen peroxide (HP; 250 mg/kg, 50 °C, 60 min), benzoyl peroxide (50 mg/kg, 50 °C, 60 min), lactoperoxidase (20 mg/kg of HP, 50 °C, 30 min), and external peroxidase (MaxiBright, DSM Food Specialties, Delft, the Netherlands; 2 dairy bleaching units/mL, 50 °C, 30 min). The experiment was repeated in triplicate. Sensory properties and volatile compounds of SWP were evaluated by a trained panel and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Bleaching efficacy (norbixin destruction) and benzoic acid were measured by HPLC. Differences in bleaching efficacy, sensory and volatile compound profiles, and benzoic acid were observed with different bleaching agents, consistent with previous studies. Solids concentration affected bleaching efficacy of HP, but not other bleaching agents. The SWP from whey bleached with HP or lactoperoxidase following RO had increased cardboard and fatty flavors and higher concentrations of lipid oxidation compounds compared with SWP from whey bleached before RO. The SWP bleached with benzoyl peroxide after RO contained less benzoic acid than SWP from whey bleached before RO.

To reach this objective, 34 subjects were recruited. Their salivary flow, oral volume and velum opening were determined. Six cheddar-based melted cheeses with different fat levels and firmness were flavoured with nonan-2-one (NO) and ethyl propanoate (EP). During their consumption (free protocol), in vivo retro nasal aroma release was followed by Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation-Mass Spectrometry (APCI-MS). Chewing activity was evaluated by electromyography recordings. Bolus saliva content, mouth-coating, and bolus rheology were also determined. Based on the quantity of aroma released before and after swallowing, subjects can be clustered into three groups: the first one (HRG) is characterized by a large quantity of aroma release whatever the aroma compound; the second one (MRG) showed a large release for EP and a lower one for NO; the third group (LRG) was characterized by a low quantity of aroma release whatever the compound. Whatever the group of subjects, fat and firmness effects differed according to the aroma compound. EP release increased with firmness and fat content, whereas NO release was not affected by firmness and decreased when fat content increased. Physiological parameters which better differentiated the three groups of subjects according to their release behaviour were chewing activity, mouth coating and frequency of velum opening. Subjects from HRG were differentiated from LRG subjects by a higher chewing activity, and more frequent velum opening. Subjects from MRG presented a lower mouth coating explaining their lower release of NO, the more hydrophobic compound. This study shows that the total amount of aroma released in the nasal cavity during food consumption depends not only on the characteristics of the product but also on the oral physiology of the subjects and on their food oral processing.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",[],[],Inter-individual retronasal aroma release variability during cheese consumption: Role of food oral processing.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30011705,2019
25233451,"Flavor is an important sensory property of fermented food products, including cheese, and largely results from the production of aroma compounds by microorganisms. Propionibacterium freudenreichii is the most widely used species of dairy propionibacteria; it has been implicated in the production of a wide variety of aroma compounds through multiple metabolic pathways and is associated with the flavor of Swiss cheese. However, the ability of other dairy propionibacteria to produce aroma compounds has not been characterized. This study sought to elucidate the effect of interspecies and intraspecies diversity of dairy propionibacteria on the production of aroma compounds in a cheese context. A total of 76 strains of Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium jensenii, Propionibacterium thoenii, and Propionibacterium acidipropionici were grown for 15 days in pure culture in a rich medium derived from cheese curd. In addition, one strain each of two phylogenetically related non-dairy propionibacteria, Propionibacterium cyclohexanicum and Propionibacterium microaerophilum were included. Aroma compounds were analyzed using headspace trap-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). An analysis of variance performed on GC-MS data showed that the abundance of 36 out of the 45 aroma compounds detected showed significant differences between the cultures. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for these 36 compounds. The first two axes of the PCA, accounting for 60% of the variability between cultures, separated P. freudenreichii strains from P. acidipropionici strains and also differentiated P. freudenreichii strains from each other. P. freudenreichii strains were associated with greater concentrations of a variety of compounds, including free fatty acids from lipolysis, ethyl esters derived from these acids, and branched-chain acids and alcohols from amino acid catabolism. P. acidipropionici strains produced less of these compounds but more sulfur-containing compounds from methionine catabolism. Meanwhile, branched-chain aldehydes and benzaldehyde were positively associated with certain strains of P. jensenii and P. thoenii.

Variables affecting HS-SPME and MHS-SPME were optimized to attain adequate sensitivity while allowing correct application of the MHS method. Thus, the MHS-SPME method was successfully performed when using 0.3g of cheese and 1 mL of NaCl (sat. solution), which is subjected to four consecutive extractions using the carboxen-polydimethylsyloxane (CAR-PDMS) as the commercial SPME coating, 40 min of HS extraction time at 45°C, and 6 min of desorption time in the GC injector at 290°C. The MHS-SPME permitted the calculation of β values, which range from 0.72±0.01-0.95±0.02, depending on the cheese studied. Later, this β parameter is used to perform quantitation for the 9 volatile FFAs after just a single HS-SPME extraction, using an external solvent calibration curve. The validity of the utilization of an external solvent calibration was tested with aqueous standards of volatile FFAs, getting average recoveries higher than 81.2%. Quantitation by MHS-SPME was free of matrix interferences despite measuring a complex cheese sample. The optimized method was validated, presenting inter-day reproducibility values (as RSD in %) lower than 13%, and limits of detection down to 7 µg kg(-1).

Plate counts revealed that cheese manufacture affected the microbial ecology. The results agreed with those from culture-independent approaches. As shown by urea-PAGE, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and free-amino-acid (FAA) analyses, the extent of secondary proteolysis mainly increased after 30 to 45 days of ripening. VOCs and volatile free fatty acids (VFFA) were identified by a purge-and-trap method (PT) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. Except for aldehydes, the levels of most of VOCs and VFFA mainly increased from 30 to 45 days onwards. As shown through pyrosequencing analysis, raw cows' milk was contaminated by Firmicutes (53%), Proteobacteria (39%), Bacteroidetes (7.8%), Actinobacteria (0.06%), and Fusobacteria (0.03%), with heterogeneity at the genus level. The primary starter Streptococcus thermophilus dominated the curd population. Other genera occurred at low incidence or sporadically. The microbial dynamics reflected on the overall physiological diversity. At 30 days, a microbial succession was clearly highlighted. The relative abundance of Streptococcus sp. and especially St. thermophilus decreased, while that of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sp., and especially Lactobacillus paracasei increased consistently. Despite the lower relative abundance compared to St. thermophilus, mesophilic lactobacilli were the only organisms positively correlated with the concentration of FAAs, area of hydrophilic peptide peaks, and several VOCs (e.g., alcohols, ketones, esters and all furans).

High performance liquid chromatography coupled to UV-Vis and mass spectrometry detection as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been used to analyze BCMs in dairy products. BCMs have been detected in raw cow's milk and human milk and a variety of commercial cheeses, but their presence has yet to be confirmed in commercial yoghurts. The finding that BCMs are present in cheese suggests they could also form in yoghurt, but be degraded during yoghurt processing. Whether BCMs do form in yoghurt and the amount of BCM forming or degrading at different processing steps needs further investigation and possibly will depend on the heat treatment and fermentation process used, but it remains an intriguing unknown.

Sensory-guided fractionation techniques using gel permeation chromatography and multi-dimension semi-preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of multiple bitter compounds.

Subsequent quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis reported that the concentrations of GPVRGPFPIIV, YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI, and MPFPKYPVEP increased during maturation by 28.7-, 3.1-, and 1.8-fold, respectively. When directly compared to young ""mild"" Cheddar, APHGKEMPFPKYPVEPF was reported only in the sharp Cheddar cheese, whereas the concentration of MAPKHKEMPFPKYPVEPF did not change. Further taste re-engineering sensory experiments confirmed the importance of the identified peptides to the bitterness of sharp Cheddar. The bitter intensity of the aged ""sharp"" Cheddar model (mild Cheddar with equivalent concentrations of the five bitter peptides in the sharp sample) was rated as not significantly different from the authentic sharp Cheddar cheese. Among the five peptides, GPVRGPFPIIV was reported to be the main contributor to the bitterness intensity of sharp Cheddar.

Polyvinylchloride (PVC)- and polyethylene (PE)-based cling-films are widely used worldwide for wrapping cheeses. For this purpose, films used in retail possess suitable technical properties such as clinginess and unrolling capacity, that are achieved by using specific plasticizers during their manufacturing process. In the present study, the main VOCs of three cling-films (either PVC-based or PE-based) for retail use were characterized by means of Solid-Phase Micro-Extraction and GC/MS. In addition, the effects of cling film type and contact time on the migration of VOCs from the films to four different PDO Italian cheeses during cold storage under light or dark were also investigated. Among the VOCs isolated from cling-films, PVC released 2-ethylhexanol and triacetin. These compounds can likely be considered as a ""non-intentionally added substance"". These same compounds were also detected in cheeses wrapped in PVC films with the highest concentration found after 20 days storage. The PE cling-film was shown to possess a simpler VOC profile, lacking some molecules peculiar to PVC films. The same conclusions can be drawn for cheeses wrapped in the PE cling-film. Other VOCs found in wrapped cheeses were likely to have been released either by direct transfer from the materials used for the manufacture of cling-films or from contamination of the films. Overall, HS-SPME is shown to be a rapid and solvent free technique to screen the VOCs profile of cling-films, and to detect VOCs migration from cling-films to cheese under real retail storage conditions.

Protein bands were quantified by QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences in the composition of the ricotta cheese were observed depending on protein concentration. Particularly, ricotta cheese resulting from the mixture containing 7.09g/100g of protein presented higher moisture (72.88±1.50g/100g) and protein (10.18±0.45g/100g) contents than that prepared from the mixture with 1.56g/100g of protein (69.52±1.75 and 6.70±0.85g/100g, respectively), and fat content was lower in this sample (12.20±1.60g/100g) compared with the other treatments, with mean values between 15.72 and 20.50g/100g.

In particular, the recovery of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin in the cheese increased as their content increased in the mixtures. It was concluded that concentrating ovine rennet whey improved the extent of heat-induced protein aggregation during the thermal coagulation process. This resulted in a better recovery of each protein fraction in the product, and in a consequent increase of ricotta cheese yield.

24856983,"In the current paper, a method is introduced to determine lactoferrin in sweet whey using reversed-phase HPLC without any pretreatment of the samples or use of a separation technique. As a starting point, the most common HPLC protocols for acid whey, which included pretreatment of the whey along with a sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE step, were tested. By skipping the pretreatment and the separation steps while altering the gradient profile, different chromatographs were obtained that proved to be equally efficient to determine lactoferrin. For this novel 1-step reversed-phase HPLC method, repeatability was very high over a wide range of concentrations (1.88% intraday to 5.89% interday). The limit of detection was 35.46μg/mL [signal:noise ratio (S/N)=3], whereas the limit of quantification was 50.86μg/mL (S/N=10). Omitting the pretreatment step caused a degradation of the column's lifetime (to approximately 2,000 samples). As a result, the lactoferrin elution time changed, but neither the accuracy nor the separation ability of the method was significantly influenced. We observed that this degradation could be easily avoided or detained by centrifuging the samples to remove fat or by extensive cleaning of the column after every 5 samples.

The procedure is based on (i) separation of the intact esters via reversed-phase ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography; (ii) detection by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry; and (iii) quantitation using selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Employing a C8 column, phytostanyl fatty acid esters sharing the same stanol nucleus could be separated according to the esterified fatty acids while esters with different stanol moieties could be distinguished via SIM based on the formation of an intense fragment ion [M - fatty acid + H](+). The suitability of the approach was demonstrated using different types of enriched foods reflecting the diversity in potential matrices (skimmed milk drinking yogurt, margarine, and soft-cheese-style spread).

24637553,"Cross contamination of foodborne pathogens in the retail environment is a significant public health issue contributing to an increased risk for foodborne illness. Ready-to-eat (RTE) processed foods such as deli meats, cheese, and in some cases fresh produce, have been involved in foodborne disease outbreaks due to contamination with pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. With respect to L. monocytogenes, deli slicers are often the main source of cross contamination. The goal of this study was to use a fluorescent compound to simulate bacterial contamination and track this contamination in a retail setting. A mock deli kitchen was designed to simulate the retail environment. Deli meat was inoculated with the fluorescent compound and volunteers were recruited to complete a set of tasks similar to those expected of a food retail employee. The volunteers were instructed to slice, package, and store the meat in a deli refrigerator. The potential cross contamination was tracked in the mock retail environment by swabbing specific areas and measuring the optical density of the swabbed area with a spectrophotometer. The results indicated that the refrigerator (i.e. deli case) grip and various areas on the slicer had the highest risk for cross contamination. The results of this study may be used to develop more focused training material for retail employees.

24598514,"Twelve lactic acid bacteria (LAB), previously selected in vitro (Gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for the continuous four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Streptococcus thermophilus. LAB were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (WBM) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in WBM and raw milk. The strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a pH drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. After 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in pH values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris PON153, Ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides PON259 and PON559 increased their number during the 15days at 7°C. A sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (PDO) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. Thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS). The dominance of lactococci over thermophilic LAB of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of VOC profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain Lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of Vastedda-like cheese.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D005516', 'D006094', 'D006801', 'D006863', 'D048668', 'D013294', 'D007934', 'D008892', 'D019105', 'D012621', 'D048249', 'D013649', 'D013696', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Food Microbiology', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactobacillus delbrueckii', 'Lactococcus lactis', 'Leuconostoc', 'Milk', 'Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique', 'Seasons', 'Streptococcus thermophilus', 'Taste', 'Temperature', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",In vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of Vastedda-like cheese.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000382', None, None, 'Q000502', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, 'genetics', None, None, 'physiology', 'physiology', 'physiology', 'microbiology', None, None, 'physiology', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24598514,2014

SPME-GC/MS was used in volatile compound analysis and a trained group of panelists carried out sensory analysis of the final product. After preliminary screening, three strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, which possess desirable technological properties, were used to prepare three starter cultures: LBP7, LBP10 and LBP14. The addition of LBP7 and LBP14 starter cultures had a significant effect (P<0.05) on lightness, leading to higher L values compared to control sausages during the ripening period. Both LBP7 and LBP14 sausages showed higher counts of lactic acid bacteria, lower growth of Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-positive catalase-positive cocci and greatly lowered the pH value compared to control sausages throughout the ripening process. At the end of the ripening process, lactic acid bacteria counts were affected (P<0.05) by the addition of starter culture since higher counts were observed in sausages prepared with LBP7 (9.14logCFU/g) and LBP14 (8.96logCFU/g) batches. The decrease of water activity during the ripening of sausages was not affected by the various starters. The texture profiles of all sausages were similar except for LBP10, which showed lower hardness and gumminess during ripening. Under the conditions of the study, volatile compounds were mainly from spices, and no marked differences were found among inoculated sausages. However, sensory evaluation revealed that most of the sensory attributes were scored higher for inoculated sausages than for the control ones.

GMP lacks aromatic amino acids including phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Because of its unique amino acid composition and various biological activities, GMP is thought to be a potential ingredient for dietetic foods (e.g., a food for PKU patients) and pharmaceuticals. Thus, increased attention has been given to the development of techniques to purify GMP. In this review, techniques of GMP purification described in patents and scientific research papers were introduced. A sialic acid assay is the important method to track GMP isolation and purification processes, for which the thiobarbituric acid reaction with 1-propanol as a chromophore extracting solvent is an inexpensive, practical and specific technique. Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography, cellulose acetate electrophoresis, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are the major techniques to identify sialic acid specific to GMP. Sephacryl S-200 chromatography and cellulose acetate electrophoresis are also used to detect GMP sialic acid in whey pearmeate and whey added commercial margarine samples.

24468402,"Caseinomacropeptide (CMP) is a peptide released by chymosin in cheese production, remaining in whey. Thus, CMP can be used as a biomarker to fluid milk adulteration through whey addition. Commonly, CMP is analyzed by reversed phase (RP-HPLC) or size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). However, some psychrotropic microorganisms - specially Pseudomonas fluorescens - when present in storaged milk, can produce, by enzymatic pathway, a CMP-like peptide generally called pseudo-CMP. These two peptides differ from each other only by one amino acid. RP-HPLC and SEC methods are unable to distinguish these two peptides, which demand development of a confirmatory method with high selectivity. Considering the several degrees of glycosilation and phosphorylation sites in CMP, allied with possible genetic variation (CMP A and CMP B), analytical methods able to differentiate these peptides are extremely complex. In the present work, we developed a proteomic-like technique for separation and characterization of these peptides, using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization able to differentiate and subsequently quantify CMP and pseudo-CMP in milk samples in order to identify adulteration or contamination of these products.

The present study evaluated the effects of milk fat homogenization and lipase treatments on methyl ketone and free fatty acid development using sensory methods and the comparison of selected volatile quantities using gas chromatography. Initial work was conducted using a blue cheese system model; subsequent work was conducted with manufactured blue cheese. In general, there were modest effects of homogenization and lipase treatments on free fatty acid (FFA) and methyl ketone concentrations in blue cheese.

Freshly pasteurized whey (0.86 L) was ultrasonicated in a contained environment at the same range of frequencies and energies for 10 and 30 min at 37°C. The US reactor used was characterized by measuring the generation of free radicals in deionized water at different frequencies (20-2000 kHz) and specific energies (8.0-390 kJ/kg). Polar lipid (PL), free and bound fatty acids and lipid oxidation derived compounds were identified and quantified before and after US processing using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with an evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD), methylation followed by gas chromatography flame ionized detector (GC-FID) and solid phase micro-extraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SPME-GCMS), respectively. The highest concentration of hydroxyl radical formation in the sonicated whey was found between 400 and 1000 kHz. There were no changes in phospholipid composition after US processing at 20, 400, 1000 and 2000 kHz compared to non-sonicated samples. Lipid oxidation volatile compounds were detected in both non-sonicated and sonicated whey. Lipid oxidation was not promoted at any tested frequency or specific energy.

24359818,"Analysis of dairy products for minerals such as sodium requires mineralization of the sample, which is typically done by either dry ashing or atmospheric wet ashing; both methods are time consuming and wet ashing requires the repeated handling of hot acid. A rapid method using microwave-accelerated acid digestion before atomic absorption spectrometry to measure sodium was compared with dry ashing in 138 samples of blue cheese (in duplicate) that varied in sodium content and age. Linear regression of the results obtained within different cheese salting treatments and sampling locations over time showed that the methods were equivalent in terms of linearity and the slope of the line. A consistent bias was observed, with lower sodium concentrations being quantified during atomic absorption spectrometry for the microwave-digested samples. Evaluation of this difference by the 2 one-sided test (TOST) procedure showed that the confidence intervals of the percentage difference between the methods fell within the predetermined acceptable percentage difference.

The research was carried out on hair sampled from 267 young adults living in Wrocław (southwest Poland). The effect of the place of residence, diet, and lifestyle on lead content in hair was examined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Lead was determined at the wavelength 220.353 nm. These outcomes were reached by linking the results of lead level in hair with the results of questionnaire survey. The mean lead level in hair of the whole examined population was 2.01 ± 2.10 mg kg(-1). Lead can enter the human body mainly by inhalation and gastrointestinal absorption. It was found that consuming cheese, fish, and lettuce caused increased level of lead in hair. On the other hand, drinking of milk, tea, coffee, or lemon resulted in decreased content of lead in hair.

DEHA was assessed as part of the Government of Canada's Chemicals Management Plan. The main source of exposure for most age groups was expected to be food. Although the margin of exposure from food and beverages is considered to be adequately protective, the Government of Canada committed to performing targeted surveys of DEHA in foods and food packaging materials to better define Canadian exposure to DEHA through dietary intake. In order to determine whether more-comprehensive targeted surveys on DEHA in foods should be conducted, 26 food composite samples from the 2011 Canadian total diet study were selected and analyzed for DEHA using a method based on solvent and dispersive solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These 26 food composites include cheese, meat, poultry, fish, and fast foods, and PVC films were likely used in packaging the individual foods used to make the composites. DEHA was detected in most of the meat, poultry, and fish composite samples, with the highest concentration found in ground beef (11 μg/g), followed by beef steak (9.9 μg/g), freshwater fish (7.8 μg/g), poultry liver pâté (7.4 μg/g), fresh pork (6.9 μg/g), cold cuts and luncheon meats (2.8 μg/g), veal cutlets (2.1 μg/g), roast beef (1.3 μg/g), lamb (1.2 μg/g), and organ meats (0.20 μg/g).

The non-EPS-producing isogenic variant Streptococcus thermophilus ST042 was used for making full-fat Caciotta-type cheese (FFC), LFC, and LFC-MWPC. Cheeses were characterized based on compositional, microbiological, biochemical, texture, volatile components (purge and trap, and solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), and sensory analyses. Compared with FFC and LFC (51.6 ± 0.7 to 53.0 ± 0.9%), the other cheese variants retained higher levels of moisture (60.5 ± 1.1 to 67.5 ± 0.5%). The MWPC mainly contributed to moisture retention. Overall, all LFC had approximately one-fourth (22.6 ± 0.8%) of the fat of FFC. Hardness of cheeses slightly varied over 7d of ripening. Microbial EPS positively affected cheese texture, and the texture of LFC without MWPC or microbial EPS was excessively firm. Free amino acids were at the highest levels in LFC treatments (2,705.8 ± 122 to 3,070.4 ± 123 mg/kg) due to the addition of MWPC and the peptidase activity of adjunct cultures. Aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, sulfur compounds, and short- to medium-chain carboxylic acids differentiated LFC variants and FFC.

Principal components analysis provided an overview of the effect of sodium chloride content and kind of lactic acid bacteria starter on the metabolic profile in the ripening process of Cheddar cheese and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis unveiled the difference in characteristic metabolites. When the sodium chloride contents were different (1.6 and 0.2%) but the same lactic acid bacteria starter was used, the 2 cheeses were classified by orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis from their metabolic profiles, but were not given perfect discrimination. Not much difference existed in the metabolic profile between the 2 cheeses. Compounds including lactose, galactose, lactic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, and phosphate were identified as contents that differed between the 2 cheeses. On the other hand, in the case of the same salt content of 1.6%, but different kinds of lactic acid bacteria starter, an excellent distinctive discrimination model was obtained, which showed that the difference of lactic acid bacteria starter caused an obvious difference in metabolic profiles. Compounds including lactic acid, lactose, urea, 4-aminobutyric acid, galactose, phosphate, proline, isoleucine, glycine, alanine, lysine, leucine, valine, and pyroglutamic acid were identified as contents that differed between the 2 cheeses. Then, a good sensory prediction model for ""rich flavor,"" which was defined as ""thick and rich, including umami taste and soy sauce-like flavor,"" was constructed based on the metabolic profile during ripening using partial least squares regression analysis.

24106758,"Swiss cheese contains more than 200 volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been utilized for the analysis of volatile compounds in food products; however, it is not sensitive enough to measure VOCs directly in the headspace of a food at low concentrations. Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) provides a basis for determining the concentrations of VOCs in the head space of the sample in real time at low concentration levels of parts per billion/trillion by volume. Of the Swiss cheese VOCs, relatively few have a major impact on flavor quality. VOCs with odor activity values (OAVs) (concentration/odor threshold) greater than one are considered high-impact flavor compounds. The objective of this study was to utilize SIFT-MS concentrations in conjunction with odor threshold values to determine OAVs thereby identifying high-impact VOCs to use for differentiating Swiss cheese from five factories and identify the factory variability. Seventeen high-impact VOCs were identified for Swiss cheese based on an OAV greater than one in at least 1 of the 5 Swiss cheese factories. Of these, 2,3-butanedione was the only compound with significantly different OAVs in all factories; however, cheese from any pair of factories had multiple statistically different compounds based on OAV. Principal component analysis using soft independent modeling of class analogy statistical differentiation plots, with all of the OAVs, showed differentiation between the 5 factories.

24102418,"Fluid whey or retentate are often bleached to remove residual annatto Cheddar cheese colorant, and this process causes off-flavors in dried whey proteins. This study determined the impact of temperature and bleaching agent on bleaching efficacy and volatile components in fluid whey and fluid whey retentate. Freshly manufactured liquid whey (6.7% solids) or concentrated whey protein (retentate) (12% solids, 80% protein) were bleached using benzoyl peroxide (BP) at 100 mg/kg (w/w) or hydrogen peroxide (HP) at 250 mg/kg (w/w) at 5 °C for 16 h or 50 °CC for 1 h. Unbleached controls were subjected to a similar temperature profile. The experiment was replicated three times. Annatto destruction (bleaching efficacy) among treatments was compared, and volatile compounds were extracted and separated using solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS). Bleaching efficacy of BP was higher than HP (P < 0.05) for fluid whey at both 5 and 50 °C. HP bleaching efficacy was increased in retentate compared to liquid whey (P < 0.05). In whey retentate, there was no difference between bleaching with HP or BP at 50 or 5 °C (P > 0.05). Retentate bleached with HP at either temperature had higher relative abundances of pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, and octanal than BP bleached retentate (P < 0.05).

In the current study, a simple and rapid proteomics-based MALDI-TOF MS approach was developed to detect L. monocytogenes directly from selective enrichment broths. Milk samples spiked with single species and multiple species cultures were incubated in a selective enrichment broth for 24h, followed by an additional 6h secondary enrichment. As few as 1 colony-forming unit (cfu) of L. monocytogenes per mL of initial selective broth culture could be detected within 30h. On applying the same approach to solid foods previously implicated in listeriosis, namely chicken pâté, cantaloupe and Camembert cheese, detection was achieved within the same time interval at inoculation levels of 10cfu/mL.

The description of main physiological steps (product mastication and swallowing) and physical mechanisms (mass transfer, product breakdown and dissolution) occurring while eating allowed satisfactory simulation of in vivo release profiles of ethyl propanoate and 2-nonanone, measured by Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry on ten representative subjects during the consumption of four cheeses with different textures. Model sensitivity analysis showed that the main parameters affecting release intensity were the product dissolution rate in the mouth, the mass transfer coefficient in the bolus, the air-bolus contact area in the mouth and the respiratory frequency. Parameters furthermore affecting release dynamics were the mastication phase duration, the velopharynx opening and the rate of saliva incorporation into the bolus.

The chemical score for each food was determined using the recommendations for children of 1-2 years of age, and the digestibility was evaluated using a multienzyme technique. Lysine was the limiting amino acid in cereal-based products (scores 15 to 54), and methionine and cysteine were limiting in legume products (scores 41 to 47), boiled beef (score = 75) and hamburger (score = 82). The method of preparation had an effect on the content of certain amino acids, some of them increased and others decreased their content. Meat products and regional cheese provided a high amino acid score (scores 67 to 91) and digestibility (80.7 to 87.8%). Bologna, a processed meat product, had a lower digestibility (75.4%).

23790854,"The presence of β-lactam residues in foodstuffs constitutes a potential risk to the human health and undesirable effects on consumers, and nowadays these antibiotic residues are also recognised as an emerging environmental problem. In addition, these are of great concern to prestigious Manchego cheese processors (Central Spain denomination of origin) because they reduce the curdling of milk and cause improper cheese ripening, which consequently lead to an important loss of monetary income. This work describes the development of a sensitive and reliable method using liquid chromatography with UV-diode array detection (LC-DAD) for simultaneous determination of the β-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin (AMP), benzylpenicillin (PEG), cephalexin (CFX), cefazolin (CFL), cefoperazone (CFP), cloxacillin (CLO), dicloxacillin (DCL), oxacillin (OXA) and phenoxymethylpenicillin (PEV), in Manchega ewe milk. The column, mobile phase, temperature and flow rate were optimised to provide the best resolution of these analytes. The extraction method of the antibiotic residues involves the deproteinisation of the milk sample using acetonitrile and centrifugation followed by a solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up. The recoveries for the studied β-lactams ranged from 79% to 96% with relative standard deviations between 0.5% and 4.9%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) for all these compounds were in the range of 3.4-8.6μgkg(-1), which are lower than the maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the European Union for the studied β-lactams in milk, making the method suitable for performing routine analyses. The proposed multi-residue LC-UV-diode array detection (LC-DAD) method is a powerful and popular alternative for the determination and confirmation of antibiotic residues in small milk industries and is the first one capable of determining nine β-lactam antibiotics in samples of Manchega ewe milk.

23684038,"In long-ripened cheese, flavor formation occurs during ripening. The metabolism of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) leads to the production of different compounds that contribute to the flavor of cheese. The contribution of LAB to the formation of cheese flavor has previously been studied. However, the specific nonstarter LAB (NSLAB) metabolic reactions in ripened cheese that lead to the formation of flavor compounds remain unclear. In ripened cheese, the nutrient sources available include small peptides or amino acids, citrate, lactate, free fatty acids, and starter LAB cell lysis products. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of NSLAB to produce volatile flavor compounds by using an in vitro system that used only the nutrients available in ripened cheese as the energy source. Moreover, the potential contribution of the NSLAB volatilome on total cheese flavor is discussed. For this purpose, the production of volatile compounds on cheese-based medium (CBM) and on starter LAB lysed cell medium (LCM) by 2 Lactobacillus casei and 2 Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains, previously isolated from ripened Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, was investigated. The generated volatile compounds were analyzed with head-space gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Overall, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and acids were the most abundant compounds produced. Differences in volatilome production were found between NSLAB grown in LCM and CBM. The catabolic metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids were required for NSLAB growth on LCM. Conversely, pyruvate metabolism was the main catabolic pathway that supported growth of NSLAB in CBM. This study can be considered a first step toward a better understanding of how microbiota involved in the long ripening of cheese may contribute to the development of cheese flavor.

23548280,"Milk fat is encapsulated in a milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) that contains bioactive glycoproteins and glycolipids. The MFGM inhibits infectivity of rotavirus (RV), activity that has been attributed to its glycoprotein and carbohydrate components. However, previous studies of proteins and oligosaccharides in the MGFM have not accounted for all the bioactivity associated with the complete MFGM. The lipid fraction of the MFGM accounts for half of its composition by weight, and we postulate that this fraction should be tested by itself to determine if it plays a role in antiviral activity. Herein, the anti-RV activity of an organic extract of MFGM was tested. Natural and whey buttermilk powders containing bovine MFGM enriched in polar lipids were prepared by microfiltration and supercritical fluid extraction treatment to reduce the triglyceride content of the powders. Lipid fractions were then extracted from the MFGM using both single- and dual-phase extraction methods. Whole MFGM and organic extracts were screened in MA-104 cells for anti-infective activity against a neuraminidase-sensitive rotavirus using a focus-forming unit assay. Dose-dependent inhibition was observed for whole buttermilk and cheese whey MFGM against the rotavirus. In general, buttermilk MFGM exhibited greater RV percentage inhibition than cheese whey MFGM. Organic-soluble anti-RV compounds were identified in bovine MFGM. The most active fraction, isolated by dual-phase extraction and iatrobead chromatography, was free of proteins and highly nonpolar. Further separation of this fraction in a less polar solvent (30:1 chloroform:methanol) resolved at least 5 lipid-containing compounds, which likely contribute to the anti-RV activity associated with bovine MFGM.

23453516,"The effect of goat breed and starter culture on volatile composition and sensory scores in goat milk cheese was studied during 90d of ripening. Milk from 2 goat breeds (Gokceada and Turkish Saanen) and different starter culture systems (no starter, mesophilic and thermophilic starters) were used in the manufacture of goat milk cheeses (called Gokceada goat cheese). Volatile composition was determined by a solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometric method. Sixty compounds including esters (13), carboxylic acids (7), aldehydes (6), ketones (8), alcohols (14), and miscellaneous compounds (12) were identified. Esters, alcohols, and carboxylic acids were the main classes of volatile components in the cheeses. Both qualitatively and quantitatively, the use of different starter cultures and goat breeds significantly influenced the volatile fraction of goat milk cheese. Decanoic, hexanoic, and octanoic (commonly named capric, caproic, and caprylic) acids were indicator compounds to distinguish the goat breeds. Principal component analysis grouped the cheeses based on the use of starter culture and goat breed. Starter-free cheeses were separately located on the plot and age-related changes were present in all samples. Sensory evaluation of 90-d-old cheeses showed that the cheeses from the Gokceada breed received higher odor, flavor, and quality scores than those from the Turkish Saanen breed, and cheeses made using mesophilic starters resulted in the most satisfactory scores for flavor and quality attributes.

23438683,"The consumer trend for healthier food choices and preferences for low-fat products has increased the interest in low-fat cheese and nutraceutical dairy products. However, consumer preference is still for delicious food. Low- and reduced-fat cheeses are not completely accepted because of their unappealing properties compared with full-fat cheeses. The method reported here provides another option to the conventional cheese-making process to obtain lower fat cheese. Using CO(2) as a supercritical fluid offers an alternative to reduce fat in cheese after ripening, while maintaining the initial characteristics and flavor. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of pressure (10, 20, 30, and 40 × 10(6) Pa) of supercritical CO(2) on the amount of fat extracted, microbial population, polar lipid profile, and microstructure of 2 varieties of goat cheese: Majorero, a protected denomination of origin cheese from Spain, and goat Gouda-type cheese. The amount of fat was reduced 50 to 57% and 48 to 55% for Majorero and goat Gouda-type cheeses, respectively. Higher contents (on a fat basis) of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine were found in Majorero cheese compared with control and goat Gouda-type cheeses. The microbial population was reduced after supercritical fluid extraction in both cheeses, and the lethality was higher as pressure increased in Majorero cheese, most noticeably on lactococcus and lactobacillus bacteria. The Gouda-type cheese did not contain any lactobacilli. Micrographs obtained from confocal laser scanning microscopy showed a more open matrix and whey pockets in the Majorero control cheese. This could explain the ease of extracting fat and reducing the microbial counts in this cheese after treatment with supercritical CO(2). Supercritical fluid extraction with CO(2) has great potential in the dairy industry and in commercial applications. The Majorero cheese obtained after the supercritical fluid extraction treatment was an excellent candidate as a low-fat goat cheese, lower in triglycerides and cholesterol but still with all the health benefits inherent in goat milk.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D058491', 'D002611', 'D025924', 'D063427', 'D005524', 'D006041', 'D008055', 'D011312']","['Animals', 'Bacterial Load', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid', 'Food Quality', 'Food Technology', 'Goats', 'Lipids', 'Pressure']","Effects of supercritical fluid extraction pressure on chemical composition, microbial population, polar lipid profile, and microstructure of goat cheese.","[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23438683,2013

This accumulation of large peptides, including those from α(s1)- and α(s2)-caseins, was in agreement with the lower overall extent of proteolysis obtained in ITGLH77 cheeses, which can be attributed to the presence of one cell envelope proteinase of the lactobacilli strains or lesser release of intracellular peptidases into the cheese aqueous phase. In parallel, stretchability was measured throughout ripening time. Emmental strands observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed microstructure similar to that of mozzarella strands.

(European yew) is well known and has led to public concerns about the safety of eating or drinking from utensils crafted from the wood of this poisonous species. The occurrence of basic taxoids in the heartwood of T. baccata had not been examined in detail, although the bark is known to contain 2'β-deacetoxyaustrospicatine. Initial examination of heartwood extracts for 2'β-deacetoxyaustrospicatine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed the presence of this basic taxoid at about 0.0007% dry weight, using a standard isolated from bark. Analyses for taxine B, however, proved negative at the extract concentration analysed. Observing other basic taxoids within the heartwood extracts was facilitated by developing generic LC-MS methods that utilised a fragment arising from the N-containing acyl group of basic taxoids as a reporter ion. Of the various MS strategies available on a hybrid ion trap-orbitrap instrument that allowed observation of this reporter ion, combining all-ion collisions with high resolution ion filtering by the orbitrap was most effective, both in terms of the number of basic taxoids detected and sensitivity. Numerous basic taxoids, in addition to 2'β-deacetoxyaustrospicatine, were revealed by this method in heartwood extracts of T. baccata. Red wine readily extracted the basic taxoids from heartwood while coffee extracted them less efficiently. Contamination with basic taxoids could also be detected in soft cheese that had been spread onto wood.

23295111,"Whey proteins that have been removed before the cheese-making process are referred to as ""native"" whey proteins or milk serum proteins. Because serum proteins isolated directly from milk are not exposed to the cheese-making process, they are free from functional or sensory effects arising from this process. Whey proteins used in food and beverage applications are largely derived from annatto-colored Cheddar cheese. Some of the annatto is left in the whey and this color is converted to a colorless compound by bleaching. The effect of bleaching serum proteins on flavor and functionality of spray-dried protein provides a platform to investigate the effect of bleaching free from the confounding effects of cheese manufacture. The objective of this study was to characterize and compare the sensory and functional properties of 80% milk serum protein concentrate (SPC80) produced from bleached and unbleached microfiltration (MF) permeate made from skim milk with and without added annatto color. Colored and uncolored MF permeates were bleached with benzoyl peroxide (BP) or hydrogen peroxide (HP), ultrafiltered, diafiltered, and spray-dried. The SPC80 from unbleached colored and uncolored MF permeates were manufactured as controls. All treatments were manufactured in triplicate. All SPC80 were evaluated by sensory testing, instrumental analyses, functionality, color, and proximate analysis. The HP-bleached SPC80 was higher in lipid oxidation compounds than BP-bleached or unbleached SPC80, specifically hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, decanal, and 2,3-octadienone. The HP treatments were higher in aroma intensity and cardboard and fatty flavors compared with the unbleached and BP-bleached SPC80. The SPC80 bleached with BP had lower concentrations of norbixin compared with SPC80 bleached with HP. Functionality testing demonstrated that HP treatments had more soluble protein after 10min of heating at 90°C and pH 4.6 and pH 7 compared with the no bleach and BP treatments, regardless of additional color. Foams generated from bleached SPC80 were more stable than those from unbleached SPC80, and those bleached with HP were lower in yield stress than other SPC80. Overall, HP bleaching destroyed less norbixin and caused more lipid oxidation and subsequent off-flavors than did BP bleaching. However, the heat stability of SPC80 was enhanced by HP bleaching compared with control treatments or BP bleaching.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D057886', 'D002338', 'D063427', 'D008401', 'D006358', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D000067816']","['Animals', 'Bleaching Agents', 'Carotenoids', 'Food Quality', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hot Temperature', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Whey Proteins']",Effect of bleaching permeate from microfiltered skim milk on 80% serum protein concentrate.,"[None, 'Q000494', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None]","[None, 'pharmacology', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23295111,2013

This illegal practice has commercial, ethical, and serious sanitary consequences because consumers can be exposed to hidden allergens contained in the undeclared cows' milk. Here, we investigated the possibility of using matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALDI)-time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) as a rapid, sensitive, and accurate technique for detection of milk adulteration by analysis of phospholipid profiles. Lipid extracts of pure raw milk, commercial milk, and binary mixtures of cows' and goats' milk and cows' and sheep's milk (the concentrations of each milk varied from 0 % to 50 %) were analyzed with α-cyano-4-chlorocinnamic acid as matrix. The abundance ratio of the ions at m/z 703 and m/z 706 was found to be species-correlated and was used as marker of cows' milk in sheep's and goats' milk. Furthermore, the procedure could potentially be applied to cheese samples, because peaks at m/z 703 and 706 were also found in several commercial cheese samples.

23225177,"Biogenic amines (BAs) that are produced through naturally occurring decarboxylation of amino acids have toxicological effects on humans. Bacterial amine oxidases are useful tools for the rapid quantification of BAs in foods. To develop amine oxidases for the rapid detection of BAs, the genes for amine oxidases from Arthobacter aurescens TC-1, designated AMAO1, AMAO2, and AMAO3, respectively, were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. AMAO1 was catalytically inactive to BAs, and AMAO3 showed a narrow substrate spectrum. In contrast, AMAO2 exhibited activity with relative k cat/K M values of 100:49.6:7.6 for 2-phenylethylamine, tyramine, and histamine, respectively. AMAO2 also utilized putrescine and spermidine as substrates, with four or five orders of magnitude lower k cat/K M values than that of 2-phenylethylamine. AMAO2 and AMAO3 were seriously affected by substrate inhibition. Using BA mixtures (consisting of 2-phenylethylamine, tyramine, and histamine) as samples, the detection range of the enzymatic analysis of BA using AMAO2 was determined to be 2.5-120 μM, and its detection limit was 2.3 μM. Analysis of five commercial cheese products revealed that the BA contents determined by the enzymatic methods showed a good agreement with the sum of three monoamines and histamine by HPLC. Therefore, the enzymatic assay using AMAO2 can be used in quality control of food products through rapid, sensitive, and preliminary estimation of major BAs including the most important TyrN and HisN in foods.",World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,"['D006631', 'D001173', 'D001679', 'D002623', 'D002851', 'D003001', 'D004926', 'D005504', 'D015870', 'D007700', 'D013379']","['Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)', 'Arthrobacter', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Escherichia coli', 'Food Analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Kinetics', 'Substrate Specificity']",Characterization of amine oxidases from Arthrobacter aurescens and application for determination of biogenic amines.,"['Q000235', 'Q000201', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000379', None, None, None]","['genetics', 'enzymology', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'genetics', 'methods', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23225177,2013

23147815,"Over the past years, LC-MS-based approaches have gained a growing interest in food analysis by using different platforms and methodologies. In particular, enhanced selectivity and sensitivity of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scan function offer powerful capabilities in detecting and quantifying specific analytes within complex mixtures such as food matrices. The MRM approach, traditionally applied in biomedical research, is particularly suitable for the detection of food adulteration and for the verification of authenticity to assure food safety and quality, both recognized as top priorities by the European Union Commission. Increasingly stringent legislation ensure products safety along every step 'from farm to fork', especially for traditional foods designed with the Protected Designation of Origin certification. Therefore, there is a growing demand of new methodologies for defining food authenticity in order to preserve their unique traits against frauds.

Individual milk samples were collected from 913 Brown Swiss cows reared in 63 herds located in Trento Province (Italy). Milk coagulation properties (MCP) were measured using 2 different instruments: Formagraph and Optigraph. Both instruments were housed in the same laboratory and operated by the same technician. Each sample was analyzed simultaneously on each instrument. All experimental conditions (milk temperature and the concentration and type of rennet) were identical. For the analysis, univariate and bivariate animal models were implemented using Bayesian methods. Univariate analyses were conducted to test the hypothesis that the traits showed additive genetic determination. Deviance information criterion, Bayes factor, and mean squared error were used as model choice criteria. The main results were that (1) RCT could be measured on all samples by extending the observation time to 45 min, and its genetic parameters (h(2)=0.23) and breeding values could be estimated while avoiding the bias of noncoagulating samples; (2) curd-firming rate could be measured on almost all milk samples, and its genetic parameters could be estimated for the first time on a field data set (h(2)=0.21); (3) for the first time, genetic parameters of curd firmness 45 min after rennet addition (h(2)=0.12) were estimated, and they were compared with curd firmness 30 min after rennet addition (h(2)=0.17); and (4) MCP estimated using the Optigraph appeared to be genetically different from those determined by Formagraph, with the partial exception of RCT (genetic correlation=0.97). Breeding strategies for the improvement of MCP must be planned with caution.

23084885,"Montasio is a typical protected designation of origin (PDO) Italian semi-hard and semi-cooked cheese produced in northeast Italy from raw or thermized cow's milk. The PDO label implies that the product has distinctive characteristics that are connected to traditional production methods. The aim of this work was to precisely characterize the volatile fraction of this Italian cheese. The volatile profile can be considered a fingerprint because the flavor of a cheese variety is the result of a specific balance between the volatile compounds produced during the ripening process. Analysis of the volatile profile of Montasio cheese was performed by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography. Six cheesemaking trials were performed, each in a different dairy located within the Montasio cheese production area. Cheeses were analyzed at 5 stages of ripening (60, 90, 170, 300, and 365 d). Only 11 compounds were identified and measured: 5 fatty acids, 3 alcohols, 2 ketones, and 1 ester. The limited number of volatile compounds measured in the headspace of the Montasio cheese is probably due to the specific making process of this cheese, which affects evolution of the microflora and the biochemical processes of ripening. The total volatile fraction profile progressively increased from 60 to 170 d, after which time it remained almost steady. The most important contributors were found to be ethanol, short-chain fatty acids (C(2) to C(6)), diacetyl, and ethyl hexanoate.

This technique consists on the labeling of proteins by specific fluorescent dyes (CyDyes). The results, obtained with G. candidum cells subjected to cold temperature, show significant proteomic patterns differences compared with the standard conditions. Furthermore, this biochemical response seems strain specific. 2D DIGE technology combined with SameSpots™ software analysis support these results through an important statistical validity.

22972782,"In dairy field, one of the most common frauds is the adulteration of higher value types of milk (sheep's and goat's) with milk of lower value (cow's milk). This illegal practice has an economic advantage for milk producers and poses a threat for consumers' health because of the presence of hidden allergens as, for example, cow milk proteins, in particular, α(s1)-casein and β-lactoglobulin. The urgent need of sensitive techniques to detect this kind of fraud brought to the development of chromatographic, immunoenzymatic, electrophoretic and mass spectrometric assays. In the current work, we present a fast, reproducible and sensitive method based on the direct matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS analysis of milk tryptic digests for the detection of milk adulteration by evaluating specie-specific markers in the peptide profiles. Several pure raw and commercial milk samples and binary mixtures containing cows' and goats', cows' and sheep's and goats' and sheep's milk (concentrations of each milk varied from 0% to 100%) were prepared, and tryptic digests were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The use of the new MALDI matrix α-cyano-4-chlorocinnamic acid allowed to detect cow and goat milk peptide markers up to 5% level of adulteration.

In this research a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric with electrospray ionization method for the multi-determination of seven preservatives (benzoic acid, citric acid, hexamethylenetetramine, lysozyme, natamycin, nisin and sorbic acid) in cheese was developed. The preservatives were contemporarily extracted from cheese by a single procedure, and analyzed by RP-LC/ESI-MS/MS (Ion Trap) in positive ionization mode, with single reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition. Three sample types (hard, pasta filata and fresh cheese) were used for method evaluation. Recoveries were mostly higher than 90%; MDLs ranged from 0.02 to 0.26 mgkg(-1), and MQLs were included between 0.07 and 0.88 mgkg(-1).

22931122,"Milk and cheese are expensive foodstuffs, and their consumption is spread among the population because of their high nutritional value; for this reason they are often subjected to adulterations. Among the common illegal practices, the addition of powdered derivatives seems very difficult to detect because the adulterant materials have almost the same chemical composition of liquid milk. However, the high temperatures (180-200 °C) used for milk powder production could imply the occurrence of some protein modifications (e.g., glycation, lactosylation, oxidation, deamidation, dehydration). The modified proteins or peptides could then be used as markers for the presence of powdered milk. In this work, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was employed to analyze tryptic digests relevant to samples of raw liquid (without heat treatment), commercial liquid, and powdered cow's milk. Samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE); differences among liquid and powder milk were detected at this stage and eventually confirmed by MALDI analysis of the in gel digested proteins. Some diagnostic peptides of powdered milk, attributed to modified whey proteins and/or caseins, were identified. Then, a faster procedure was optimized, consisting of the separation of caseins from milk whey and the subsequent in-solution digestion of the two fractions, with the advantage of obtaining almost the same information in a limited amount of time. Finally, analyses were carried out with the fast procedure on liquid milk samples adulterated with powdered milk at different percentages, and diagnostic peptides were detected down to 1% of adulteration level.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D005506', 'D008892', 'D011208', 'D040901', 'D019032']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Food Contamination', 'Milk', 'Powders', 'Proteomics', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Proteomic approach based on MALDI-TOF MS to detect powdered milk in fresh cow's milk.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000379']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22931122,2013

22863106,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different storage temperatures and delivery system of the milk on the microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of Grana Trentino, a long-ripened hard-cooked Italian cheese. In particular, 3 kinds of milk storage and delivery were studied: milk delivered to the dairy in the traditional manner without temperature control, milk delivered at 18°C, and milk stored at the farm and delivered at 12°C. Milk, natural whey starter, and cheeses after 18 mo of ripening were sampled for microbiological profiles, physicochemical analysis, and proteolysis evaluation, and a study of cheese volatile compounds through a solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique was performed. Milk microbiota was not affected by any of the treatments. At the end of ripening, free fatty acid and ester contents were significantly higher in cheeses from milk without temperature control. This was probably due to the milk delivery to the dairy in churns causing the fat globule membrane break during transport and, consequently, a greater release of fat and deeper lipolysis. Milk refrigeration at 12°C for 12h before delivery affected the distribution of nitrogen fractions in cheeses. Lower temperatures of milk storage favored a larger soluble nitrogen fraction and greater cheese proteolysis, probably caused by an enhanced plasmin activity. From this work, it is concluded that both milk temperature storage and transport system could affect cheese ripening, leading to significant differences in chemical compounds: if milk was delivered by churns, higher free fatty acid and ester content in cheeses was observed; if milk was stored at 12°C for 12h before delivery, greater cheese proteolysis was induced with consequent faster ripening.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000596', 'D000818', 'D058491', 'D002417', 'D002611', 'D005511', 'D061353', 'D007558', 'D008892', 'D059748', 'D055549']","['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Load', 'Cattle', 'Cheese', 'Food Handling', 'Food Storage', 'Italy', 'Milk', 'Proteolysis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Does milk treatment before cheesemaking affect microbial and chemical traits of ripened cheese?

The susceptibility of L. plantarum Tensia to 8 antibiotics, and the presence of tetracycline (tet M, S, O, K, L) genes and class 1 integron was assessed by applying epsilometer-test and PCR-based methods. Production of biogenic amines by the probiotic strain in decarboxylation medium containing 1% of l-histidine, l-glutamine, l-ornithine, l-arginine, or l-lysine and in cheese was tested by gas chromatography. The biosafety of L. plantarum Tensia was evaluated on National Institutes of Health-line mice fed cheese containing Tensia at a concentration of 9.6 log cfu/g for 30 consecutive days. In human intervention trials in adults and the elderly, the effects of different doses of Edam-type cheese and the probiotic bacterium on BW, gut functionality indices, and host metabolism were evaluated. The strain L. plantarum Tensia was susceptible to all tested antibiotics and did not possess the tetracycline resistance-determining genes tet(L), tet(S) and tet(O), nor did it contain the integron (Int1) gene. However, the strain was tet(K) and tet(M) positive. Lactobacillus plantarum Tensia did not produce potentially harmful biogenic amines, such as histamine or cadaverine. The amount of tyramine produced in the cheese environment during ripening and after 15 wk of storage was below the clinically significant content. In the animal model, no translocation of the administered strain or other microbes into the blood or organs of mice was detected. No harmful effect was observed on body mass index, inflammatory markers, or serum lipidograms during human intervention trials with different age groups at a daily dose of 10.3 or 8.17 log cfu/serving for 3 wk. No negative effect on gastrointestinal welfare was observed, but the consumption of 100g/d for 3 wk caused hard stools from the second week of the trial.

The 2 approved chemical bleaching agents for whey, hydrogen peroxide (HP) and benzoyl peroxide (BP), negatively impact the flavor of dried whey protein. The objective of this study was to evaluate alternative methods for bleaching liquid whey: ultraviolet radiation (UV), acid-activated bentonite (BT), and ozone (OZ). Colored Cheddar cheese whey was manufactured followed by pasteurization and fat separation. Liquid whey was subjected to one of 5 treatments: control (CT) (no bleaching; 50 °C, 1 h), HP (250 mg/kg; 50 °C, 1 h), UV (1 min exposure; 50 °C), BT (0.5% w/w; 50 °C, 1 h), or OZ (2.2g/h, 50 °C, 1 h). The treated whey was then ultrafiltered, diafiltered, and spray-dried to 80% whey protein concentrate (WPC80). The entire experiment was replicated 3 times. Color (norbixin extraction and measurement), descriptive sensory, and instrumental volatile analyses were conducted on WPC80. Norbixin elimination was 28%, 79%, 39%, and 15% for HP, BT, UV, and OZ treatments, respectively. WPC80 from bleached whey, regardless of bleaching agent, had lower sweet aromatic and cooked/milky flavors compared to unbleached CT (P < 0.05). The HP and BT WPC80 had higher fatty flavor compared to the CT WPC80 (P < 0.05), and the UV and OZ WPC80 had distinct mushroom/burnt and animal flavors.

In this work, samples of three cheeses (Zamorano, Cabrales and Emmental) with long ripening periods, and that often have high BA concentrations, were screened for the presence of BA-degrading lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Seventeen isolates were found that were able to degrade tyramine and histamine in broth culture. All 17 isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as belonging to Lactobacillus casei. They were typed by plasmid S1-PFGE and genomic macrorestriction-PFGE analysis. Two strains (L. casei 4a and 5b) associated with high degradation rates for both BAs were selected to test how this ability might affect histamine and tyramine accumulation in a Cabrales-like mini-cheese manufacturing model. The quantification of BAs and the monitoring of the strains' growth over ripening were undertaken by RP-HPLC and qPCR respectively.

Thiocyanate is naturally present and the lactoperoxidase system purportedly can be used to bleach dairy products, such as whey, with the addition of very little H₂O₂ to the system. This study had 3 objectives: 1) to quantify the amount of H₂O₂ necessary for bleaching of fluid whey using the LP system, 2) to monitor LP activity from raw milk through manufacture of liquid whey, and 3) to compare the flavor of whey protein concentrate 80% (WPC80) bleached by the LP system to that bleached by traditional H₂O₂ bleaching. Cheddar cheese whey with annatto (15 mL of annatto/454 kg of milk, annatto with 3% wt/vol norbixin content) was manufactured using a standard Cheddar cheesemaking procedure. Various levels of H₂O₂ (5-100 mg/kg) were added to fluid whey to determine the optimum concentration of H₂O₂ for LP activity, which was measured using an established colorimetric method. In subsequent experiments, fat-separated whey was bleached for 1h with 250 mg of H₂O₂/kg (traditional) or 20 mg of H₂O₂/kg (LP system). The WPC80 was manufactured from whey bleached with 250 mg of H₂O₂/kg or 20mg of H₂O₂/kg. All samples were subjected to color analysis (Hunter color values and norbixin extraction) and proximate analysis (fat, protein, and moisture). Sensory and instrumental volatile analyses were conducted on WPC80. Optimal LP bleaching in fluid whey occurred with the addition of 20mg of H₂O₂/kg. Bleaching of fluid whey at either 35 or 50°C for 1 h with LP resulted in > 99% norbixin destruction compared with 32 or 47% destruction from bleaching with 250 mg of H₂O₂/kg, at 35 or 50°C for 1 h, respectively. Higher aroma intensity and increased lipid oxidation compounds were documented in WPC80 from bleached whey compared with WPC80 from unbleached whey. Monitoring of LP activity throughout cheese and whey manufacture showed that LP activity sharply decreased after 30 min of bleaching (17.01 ± 1.4 to < 1 U/mL), suggesting that sufficient bleaching takes place in a very short amount of time. Lactoperoxidase averaged 13.01 ± 0.7 U/mL in unpasteurized, fat-separated liquid whey and 138.6 ± 11.9 U/mL in concentrated retentate (11% solids).

Total of 38 volatile compounds in the cheese headspace were monitored with headspace concentrations varying between single digit parts per billion (ppb) to tens of parts per million (ppm). When the results were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis, a clear discrimination was found between the New Zealand ""parmesan"" and Italian cheeses based solely on the measured concentrations of these volatile compounds. If the volatile compounds used in the analyses were restricted to known odor-active compounds in Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, the ability to discriminate between the cheeses was maintained.

22541463,"Brown pigmentation can occasionally form in Parmesan cheese during the ripening process, creating an unappealing appearance and associated off-flavors. The browning reactions proceed at refrigerated temperatures and in the relative absence of reducing sugar, contrary to typical Maillard browning. Residual sugars, lipid oxidation products, byproducts of fermentation, and (or) enzymes may react with primary amines in cheese to form brown pigmentation and concomitantly generate volatile compounds unique to each of these reactions. Determining the volatile profiles provides a means of understanding the potential substrates involved and causative reaction pathways. This work is divided into 2 segments. The first portion characterized the pigmentation and the browning index of Parmesan cheeses with and without extensive browning. The second phase examined the volatile character of the cheeses using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Various pyrazines, such as 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine and 3,5-diethyl-2-methylpyrazine, were found in the brown cheeses but were not present in the white samples. The formation of pyrazines is proposed to result from the spontaneous condensation of aminoacetone. Aminoacetone can be formed by the Strecker degradation of amino acids with methylglyoxal, the latter a byproduct of sugar fermentation.

This buttery aroma results, in part, from the presence of the vicinal dicarbonyl, diacetyl, which imparts a high level of buttery flavor notes and is a key component of SDL. Diacetyl (2,3-butanedione) is a volatile product of citrate metabolism produced by certain bacteria, including Lactococcus lactis ssp. diacetylactis and Leuconostoc citrovorum. In the United States, SDL are regarded as generally recognized as safe ingredients, whereby usage in food products is limited by good manufacturing practices. Recently, diacetyl has been implicated as a causative agent in certain lung ailments in plant workers; however, little is published about the volatile composition of SDL and the levels of diacetyl or other flavoring components in finished dairy products. The objective of this work was to characterize the volatile compounds of commercial SDL and to quantitate levels of diacetyl and other Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association-designated high-priority flavoring components found in 18 SDL samples and 24 selected dairy products.

In addition to diacetyl (ranging from 1.2 to 22,000 μg/g), 40 compounds including 8 organic acids, 4 alcohols, 3 aldehydes, 7 esters, 3 furans, 10 ketones, 2 lactones, 2 sulfur-containing compounds, and 1 terpene were detected in the SDL. A total of 22 food samples were found to contain diacetyl ranging from 4.5 to 2,700 μg/100g. Other volatile compounds, including acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetoin, benzaldehyde, butyric acid, formic acid, furfural, 2,3-heptanedione, 2,3-pentanedione, and propanoic acid, were also identified and quantified in SDL or food samples, or both.

22305888,"Due to increasingly available bacterial genomes in databases, proteomic tools have recently been used to screen proteins expressed by micro-organisms in food in order to better understand their metabolism in situ. While the main objective is the systematic identification of proteins, the next step will be to bridge the gap between identification and quantification of these proteins. For that purpose, a new mass spectrometry-based approach was applied, using isobaric tagging reagent for quantitative proteomic analysis (iTRAQ), which are amine specific and yield labelled peptides identical in mass. Experimental Swiss-type cheeses were manufactured from microfiltered milk using Streptococcus thermophilus ITG ST20 and Lactobacillus helveticus ITG LH1 as lactic acid starters. At three ripening times (7, 20 and 69 days), cheese aqueous phases were extracted and enriched in bacterial proteins by fractionation. Each sample, standardised in protein amount prior to proteomic analyses, was: i) analysed by 2D-electrophoresis for qualitative analysis and ii) submitted to trypsinolysis, and labelled with specific iTRAQ tag, one per ripening time. The three labelled samples were mixed together and analysed by nano-LC coupled on-line with ESI-QTOF mass spectrometer. Thirty proteins, both from bacterial or bovine origin, were identified and efficiently quantified. The free bacterial proteins detected were enzymes from the central carbon metabolism as well as stress proteins.

The inhibitory substance produced by E. faecalis UGRA10 was purified and characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, confirming its identity with AS-48 enterocin (7.150 Da). Subsequent genetic analysis showed the existence of the as-48 gene cluster on a plasmid of approximately 70-kb. The UGRA10 strain was examined for safety properties such as enterococci virulence genes, biogenic amine production, and antibiotic resistance. As for most E. faecalis strains, PCR amplification revealed the existence of gene encoding for GelE, Asa1, Esp, EfaA, and Ace antigens and for tyrosine decarboxylase. This strain was sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested, being resistant only to aminoglycosides, lincosamide, and pristinamicins. In addition, UGRA10 developed an ability to form biofilms and to adhere to Caco 2 and HeLa 229 cells. More interestingly, this strain shows a high ability to interfere with the adhesion of Listeria monocytogenes to Caco 2 cells.

In this study, we have compared the secretome and whole-cell proteome of one food isolate (E. faecalis DISAV 1022) and one clinical isolate (E. faecalis H1) by 2-DE and iTRAQ analyses, respectively. Extracellular protein patterns differed significantly, with only seven proteins common to both strains. Notably, only the clinical isolate expressed various well-characterized virulence factors such as the gelatinase coccolysin (GelE) and the extracellular serine proteinase V8 (SprE). Moreover, various other putative virulence factors, e.g. superoxide dismutase, choline- and chitin-binding proteins and potential moonlighting proteins, have been detected exclusively in the secretome of the clinical isolate, but not in the food isolate. The iTRAQ analysis of whole-cell proteins of the two strains highlighted a stronger expression of pathogenic traits such as an endocarditis-specific antigen and an adhesion lipoprotein in the pathogenic strain E. faecalis H1. Subsequently, six food isolates (including E. faecalis DISAV 1022) and six clinical isolates (including E. faecalis H1) were tested for the presence of gelatinase and protease activity in the culture supernatants. Both enzymatic activities were found in the clinical as well as the food isolates which clearly indicates that protease expression is strain specific and not representative for pathogenic isolates.

22177229,"The technological and safety properties of 35 indigenous strains of Enterococcus faecium isolated from two Egyptian cheeses were characterised in order to determine their ability for rational manufacture of diversified and typical dairy products in the Middle East. A great diversity was observed within the 35 strains on the basis of their technological properties. A statistical analysis made it possible to distribute the 35 strains of E. faecium into different groups. Three groups were identified in terms of their acidification activity, measured by the Cinac system: a group of strains that quickly acidified milk, a second that moderately acidified milk, and a last cluster that revealed weak acidification activity. On the basis of texturing properties that were evaluated using a texturometer and a viscometer, a cluster of strains produced viscous and firm gels, a second cluster included fairly viscous, firm and cohesive gels, and a last group generated slightly viscous, but firm and very cohesive gels. By considering the aroma profiles that were determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, four clusters were identified. One cluster displayed a high dimethyl disulfide level, a second group of strains was highly aromatic, a third cluster led to typical ""lactic"" products, and the last cluster made it possible to obtain low aromatic products. None of the 35 strains proved to be β-haemolytic on the basis of the characterisation of their safety properties. The resistance to 20 antibiotics was assessed by the disc diffusion method. The 35 isolates were sensitive to 12 antibiotics, and among them, one isolate was resistant to only two antibiotics (nalixidic acid and streptomycin). The resistance to eight antibiotics was strain-dependant.

21995443,"Lactobacillus plantarum LMG P-26358 isolated from a soft French artisanal cheese produces a potent class IIa bacteriocin with 100% homology to plantaricin 423 and bacteriocidal activity against Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. The bacteriocin was found to be highly stable at temperatures as high as 100°C and pH ranges from 1-10. While this relatively narrow spectrum bacteriocin also exhibited antimicrobial activity against species of enterococci, it did not inhibit dairy starters including lactococci and lactobacilli when tested by well diffusion assay (WDA). In order to test the suitability of Lb. plantarum LMG P-26358 as an anti-listerial adjunct with nisin-producing lactococci, laboratory-scale cheeses were manufactured. Results indicated that combining Lb. plantarum LMG P-26358 (at 108 colony forming units (cfu)/ml) with a nisin producer is an effective strategy to eliminate the biological indicator strain, L. innocua. Moreover, industrial-scale cheeses also demonstrated that Lb. plantarum LMG P-26358 was much more effective than the nisin producer alone for protection against the indicator.

The method employs a safe extraction solution (mixture of acetonitrile, methanol and water) and an immunoaffinity column (IAC) for clean-up. Compared with the widely used method employing chloroform and a Florisil column, the IAC method has a short analytical time and there are no interference peaks. The limits of quantification (LOQ) of the IAC method were 0.12 and 0.14 µg/kg, while those of the Florisil column method were 0.47 and 0.23 µg/kg in cheese and buffer, respectively. The recovery and relative standard deviation (RSD) for cheese (spiked at 0.5 µg/kg) in the IAC method were 92% and 7%, respectively, while for the Florisil column method the corresponding values were 76% and 10%. The recovery and RSD for butter (spiked at 0.5 µg/kg) in the IAC method were 97% and 9%, and those in the Florisil method were 74% and 9%, respectively. In the IAC method, the values of in-house precision (n=2, day=5) of cheese and butter (spiked at 0.5 µg/kg) were 9% and 13%, respectively.

Enzymes extracted from whole crustaceans, mainly serine proteases, showed high caseinolytic and moderate clotting activities. Analysis by 2D zymography of the digestive enzymes extracted from Munida hepatopancreas, showed the presence of several isotrypsin- and isochymotrypsin-like enzymes in the range of 20-34 kDa and 4.1-5.8 pI. Moreover, specific enzymatic assays showed the presence of aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases A and B. Overall, optimum activity was achieved at pH 7.5 and 40-45 °C. Caseinolytic activity, determined both spectrophotometrically and by SDS gel electrophoresis, indicated higher activity on β-casein than on α-casein. Miniature cheddar-type cheeses and Pecorino-type cheeses were manufactured by adding starter, rennet and Munida extracts to milk. Reverse-phase HPLC and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry showed a more complex pattern of proteolytic products in cheeses made using Munida instead of chymosin. Munida extracts were found to degrade the chymosin-derived β-casein fragment f193-209, one of the peptides associated with bitterness in cheese.

Forty-five strains of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum were characterized for their growth capabilities at different temperatures, NaCl concentrations, and pH values and for in vitro lipolytic and proteolytic activities. Moreover, their spoilage potential in meat was investigated by analyzing the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in meat stored in air or vacuum packs. Almost all the strains were able to grow at 4, 10, and 20°C, at pH values of 6 to 9, and in the presence of 2.5% NaCl. The release of VOCs by each strain in beef stored at 4°C in air and vacuum packs was evaluated by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME)-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. All the meat samples inoculated and stored in air showed higher numbers of VOCs than the vacuum-packed meat samples. Acetoin, 1-octen-3-ol, and butanoic acid were the compounds most frequently found under both storage conditions. The contaminated meat samples were evaluated by a sensory panel; the results indicated that for all sensory odors, no effect of strain was significant (P > 0.05). The storage conditions significantly affected (P < 0.05) the perception of dairy, spoiled-meat, and mozzarella cheese odors, which were more intense in meat stored in air than in vacuum packs but were never very intense.

The ND device can be specifically constructed such that the sampling gas beam is bubbled through the liquid sample (microjet sampling) or directed to impact the sample surface (e.g., for the analysis of a material like cheese). The ND-EESI-MS analysis process requires no sample pretreatment because it can tolerate an extremely complex matrix. ND-EESI-MS allows real-time, online chemical profiling of highly viscous samples under ambient conditions. Both volatile and nonvolatile analytes from viscous samples can easily be detected and quantified by ND-EESI-MS, thereby providing an MS-based analytical platform for multiple disciplines (e.g., for the food industry, for drug discovery, and for the biological and life sciences). Here we describe the ND-EESI-MS protocol for viscous sample analysis, including the experimental design, equipment setup, reagent preparation, data acquisition and analysis steps.

In spite of this, no official method of analysis, nor maximum tolerance level for aflatoxin M1 in cheese have been established. Thus, the aim of this work was to test the suitability of different HPLC methods for the AFM1 quantification in soft cheese samples at three different contamination levels (low, medium and high, at respectively nearly 30, 100 and 250 ng/kg). Nine participants were selected among Italian laboratories accredited by the Italian accreditation body (ACCREDIA) for HPLC toxin analysis. They were asked to analyze samples applying the method routinely used. The different applied methods were compared, and precision and accuracy parameters were evaluated. The main differences among HPLC procedures were registered at the level of extraction step. The use of an enzymatic digestion for the extraction of the toxin from cheese seemed to be particularly advantageous and the use of immunoaffinity columns seemed to be determinant for the improvement of sensitivity at low contamination levels. In general, the applied methods well discriminated the 3 levels of contamination, even though they performed better at the medium and high concentration levels (100 and 250 ng/kg) than at the low one (30 ng/kg).

Thus, the control of VSCs formation offers considerable potential for industrial applications. Here, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from different ecological origins were screened for their abilities to produce VSCs from L-methionine. From the data presented, VSC-forming abilities were shown to be strain-specific and were correlated with the C-S lyase enzymatic activities determined using different approaches. High VSCs formation were detected for those strains that were also shown to possess high thiol-producing abilities (determined either by agar plate or spectrophotometry assays). Moreover, differences in C-S lyase activities were shown to correspond with the enzymatic potential of the strains as determined by in situ gel visualization. Therefore, the assessment of the C-S lyase enzymatic potential, by means of either of these techniques, could be used as a valuable approach for the selection of LAB strains with high VSC-producing abilities thus, representing an effective way to enhance cheese sulphur aroma compounds synthesis. In this regard, this study highlights the flavour forming potential of the Streptococcus thermophilus STY-31, that therefore could be used as a starter culture in cheese manufacture.

In this study, ginger proteases were extracted from fresh ginger rhizome by using phosphate buffer and subsequently purified by ion exchange chromatography. Ginger proteases, all with a molecular weight around 31 kDa, were found to exist in 3 forms with isoelectric point values around 5.58, 5.40, and 5.22, respectively. These enzymes had very similar biochemical behavior, exhibiting optimal proteolytic activity from 40 to 60 °C and maximum milk clotting activity at 70 °C. They were capable of hydrolyzing isolated α(S1)-, β-, and κ-casein, of which α(S1)-casein was most susceptible to the enzyme; κ-casein was hydrolyzed with a higher specificity than α(S1)- and β-casein. In addition, the ginger proteases exhibited a similar affinity for κ-casein and higher specificity with increasing temperature. Gel electrophoresis and mass spectra indicated that Ala90-Glu91 and His102-Leu103 of κ-casein were the preferred target bonds of ginger proteases.

21426955,"This paper sets out to determine the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination degree of a traditionally smoked cheese: Herreño cheese, which comes from one of the Canary Islands. Its PAH profile is thoroughly studied by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in SIM mode, and compared with that of an unsmoked cheese. Furthermore, a parameter not previously studied is evaluated, namely the influence of the position of the individual cheeses in the smokehouse on their PAH contamination level. Heavy PAH, among which are included most of the carcinogens, are very scarce and their concentrations low. In fact, benz[a]anthracene, together with chrysene+triphenylene, are the only heavy PAH detected in all of the smoked samples studied. The concentration of benzo[a]pyrene, detected only in 1 of the samples, is below the limit established in Spain for the rind of smoked cheese. In contrast, high concentrations of light PAH have been found, especially of naphthalene and its alkyl derivatives, whose effect on human health is not yet well established. The results derived from the analysis of the PAH profile suggest the potential usefulness of certain ratios between some pairs of PAH (phenanthrene/anthracene, naphthalene/acenaphthylene) to provide information on the PAH contamination source. Furthermore, differences have been found, depending on the position of the cheeses in the smokehouse, those placed in the path followed by the smoke being more contaminated. Therefore, the findings of this study could help in improving the design of smokehouses, to decrease the PAH contamination degree of smoked cheese.",Journal of dairy science,"['D002611', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D008401', 'D011084', 'D012906', 'D013030']","['Cheese', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons', 'Smoke', 'Spain']",Contamination of cheese by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in traditional smoking.

Buffalo cheeses were selected according to nutritional properties and CLA content. Cheeses were previously manufactured using as adjunct culture bacteria with probiotic or technological properties. BALB/c mice were fed for 28 days, and then a single dose of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) as oxidant agent was administered before the influence of diet and DMH on antioxidant status in tissues was evaluated. Mice fed buffalo cheese showed the highest body weight gain (P < .05). Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content in foods was very different, but total PUFA incorporation was similar in mouse tissues. CLA was only detected in fat tissues of mice fed dairy products, with cis-9, trans-11 being the major isomer. A higher linolenic (C(18:3)) acid content was found in tissues of mice fed commercial diet (control group), and it was partially replaced by CLA in groups receiving buffalo milk or cheese. Lipoperoxides (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) were higher in tissues of the control group with or without DMH administration, and DMH had a cytotoxic effect on colon cells (P < .05). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities in liver and intestine were similar among animals, with a slight increase of SOD detected after DMH treatment.

21337234,"Triclabendazole (TCBZ) is a flukicidal halogenated benzimidazole compound extensively used in veterinary medicine. Liver fluke control in lactating dairy cattle is difficult because treatment should be implemented only during the dry period to avoid milk residues. However, control in endemic areas is usually implemented as regular treatments three to four times a year, even during the lactating period. Thus, information on TCBZ milk excretion and the risk of the presence of drug residues in fluid milk and milk-derivate products is essential. The experimental aims were to evaluate the comparative disposition kinetics of TCBZ and its sulpho-metabolites in plasma and milk in lactating dairy cattle after the oral administration (12 mg kg(-1)) of TCBZ and to assess the pattern of residues in cheese made with milk from treated dairy cows. Both TCBZ sulphoxide and sulphone metabolites but not TCBZ were detected in milk (up to 36 and 144 h, respectively) and plasma (up to 144 h) after oral administration of TCBZ. Residual concentrations of TCBZ sulpho-metabolites were found in cheese made with milk from treated animals. The total average residual concentration in fresh cheese was 13.0-fold higher than that obtained in milk used for its elaboration. The high concentrations of TCBZ sulpho-metabolites recovered in fresh cheese should be seriously considered before milk from treated cows is used for making dairy products.","Food additives & contaminants.

21276635,"The classical or dairy propionibacteria have well-documented industrial applications and have been proposed for probiotic applications. Given their industrial importance it is necessary to employ fast and reliable techniques to monitor the growth during products elaboration, industrial fermentations or the intestinal transit. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to design oligonucleotide probes targeting the 16S rRNA of dairy propionibacteria and optimise the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol to detect these bacteria. Two specific probes were in silico designed to detect Propionibacterium freudenreichii and P. jensenii, named Pfr435 and Pj446 respectively. The FISH protocol was optimised for the hybridisation of propionibacteria cells with the universal probe Eub338 and the designed probes. These probes were assayed in situ for their specificity to hybridise species of propionibacteria by observation using fluorescence microscopy and results were compared with the probe Pap446 previously designed for P. acidipropionici. Probes Pap446, Pfr435 and Pj446 were also evaluated by fluorescence spectrophotometry to assess the influence of cells physiological state during growth in batch culture in the fluorescence intensity. The maximum fluorescence intensity was observed at the onset of the stationary phase of growth and was then reduced. However, changes on the cells permeability did not reduce the efficiency of 16S rRNA hybridisation with the fluorescence-labelled probes. Propionibacteria counts obtained by FISH and plate count methods were compared in a commercial Gruyère cheese. The results showed that this method can be used as a rapid technique for the enumeration of these bacteria in cheese samples.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D002611', 'D015169', 'D005456', 'D005516', 'D006824', 'D017404', 'D015345', 'D011424', 'D012331', 'D012336', 'D013045']","['Cheese', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Food Microbiology', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Propionibacterium', 'RNA, Fungal', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Species Specificity']",Fluorescence in situ hybridization for detection of classical propionibacteria with specific 16S rRNA-targeted probes and its application to enumeration in Gruyère cheese.,"['Q000382', None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None]","['microbiology', None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21276635,2011
21257034,"Several attempts have been made to incorporate whey proteins into curd to increase cheese yield. For some types of cheese, degradation of whey proteins that have been incorporated into the curd would be required to obtain acceptable flavor and texture. On the basis of the high potential for protease synthesis in Aspergillus oryzae, sodium nitrate as a nitrogen source in a minimal medium for fungi, known as Czapek-Dox medium, was replaced with whey protein isolate to induce the protease to hydrolyze whey protein using A. oryzae AHU7146. A solid-phase medium adjusted to pH 6 was suitable for this purpose when incubation was carried out at 25°C for 2 wk. The application of column chromatography enabled the resolution of 3 proteolytic components (1, 2, and 3). With respect to optimal temperature and zymographic analysis, component 1 was similar to component 3. In contrast, component 2 was less abundant than the other components and exhibited activity in the alkaline pH region. The degradation of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin in whey protein isolate solution by the crude enzyme was primarily attributed to the action of components 1 and 3, based on HPLC analysis and the N-terminal amino acid sequences; however, zymography demonstrated evident proteolysis due to component 2.

Animals were milked twice daily up to day 16 post-treatment. Milk samples were subsequently analyzed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The highest levels of levamisole (<600 μg/kg) and oxyclozanide (<25 μg/kg) were determined at first and third milking, respectively. Residues of levamisole and oxyclozanide were typically below reporting limits of 0.83 and 1 μg/kg respectively at the 11th and 13th milking, respectively. Soft (3 days ripening), hard (35 days ripening) and whey cheeses were produced from the milk samples collected from the first two milkings. Levamisole residues were found to concentrate in all cheese types. There was a 3-fold concentration effect for levamisole in mature cheese. Oxyclozanide residues were found to occur at lower levels in soft and hard cheese than milk with a 10-fold concentration in whey cheese compared to milk. The results of this study demonstrate that levamisole and oxyclozanide residues are rapidly excreted in dairy cows and milk is compliant after a few days.

Two Lactobacillus paracasei strains, R-40926 and R-40937, were selected as potential adjunct cultures from a total of 734 isolates from good quality artisan raw milk Gouda-type cheeses on the basis of their prevalence in different cheese types and/or over several production batches, safety and technological parameters. Conventional culturing, isolation and identification and a combined PCR-DGGE approach using total cheese DNA extracts and DNA extracts obtained from culturable fractions were employed to monitor viability of the introduced adjuncts and their effect on the cheese microbiota. The control cheese made without adjuncts was dominated by members of the starter, i.e. Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides. In the cheeses containing either R-40926 or R-40937, the respective adjuncts increased in number as ripening progressed indicating that both strains are well adapted to the cheese environment and can survive in a competitive environment in the presence of a commercial starter culture. Principal component analysis of cheese volatiles determined by steam distillation-extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry could differentiate cheeses made with different concentrations of adjunct R-40926 from the control cheese, and these differences could be correlated to the proteolytic and lipolytic properties of this strain.

20965321,"A current industry goal is to produce a 75 to 80% fat-reduced Cheddar cheese that is tasty and appealing to consumers. Despite previous studies on reduced-fat cheese, information is critically lacking in understanding the flavor and flavor chemistry of reduced-fat and nonfat Cheddar cheeses and how it differs from its full-fat counterpart. The objective of this study was to document and compare flavor development in cheeses with different fat contents so as to quantitatively characterize how flavor and flavor development in Cheddar cheese are altered with fat reduction. Cheddar cheeses with 50% reduced-fat cheese (RFC) and low-fat cheese containing 6% fat (LFC) along with 2 full-fat cheeses (FFC) were manufactured in duplicate. Cheeses were ripened at 8°C and samples were taken following 2 wk and 3, 6, and 9 mo for sensory and instrumental volatile analyses. A trained sensory panel (n=10 panelists) documented flavor attributes of cheeses. Volatile compounds were extracted by solid-phase microextraction or solvent-assisted flavor evaporation followed by separation and identification using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-olfactometry. Selected compounds were quantified using external standard curves. Sensory properties of cheeses were distinct initially but more differences were documented as cheeses aged. By 9 mo, LFC and RFC displayed distinct burnt/rosy flavors that were not present in FFC. Sulfur flavor was also lower in LFC compared with other cheeses. Forty aroma-active compounds were characterized in the cheeses by headspace or solvent extraction followed by gas chromatography-olfactometry. Compounds were largely not distinct between the cheeses at each time point, but concentration differences were evident. Higher concentrations of furanones (furaneol, homofuraneol, sotolon), phenylethanal, 1-octen-3-one, and free fatty acids, and lower concentrations of lactones were present in LFC compared with FFC after 9 mo of ripening. These results confirm that flavor differences documented between full-fat and reduced-fat cheeses are not due solely to differences in matrix and flavor release but also to distinct differences in ripening biochemistry, which leads to an imbalance of many flavor-contributing compounds.",Journal of dairy science,"['D002611', 'D003258', 'D004041', 'D005230', 'D005511', 'D005663', 'D007659', 'D007783', 'D010626', 'D013649', 'D055549']","['Cheese', 'Consumer Behavior', 'Dietary Fats', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified', 'Food Handling', 'Furans', 'Ketones', 'Lactones', 'Phenylethyl Alcohol', 'Taste', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Impact of fat reduction on flavor and flavor chemistry of Cheddar cheeses.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20965321,2011
20854988,"This work aimed to identify technological steps that can increase fat hydrolysis and volatile compounds production in hard cheeses; these biochemical events have been related with improved piquant taste and development of genuine flavor during cheese ripening. For that purpose, 2 different pretreatments of cheese milk were tested: heat treatment and mechanical agitation. Both factors were assayed at 2 levels: milk was either batch pasteurized or nonthermally treated, and mechanical agitation was either applied or not applied. For all combinations, hard cheeses (Reggianito type) were produced in a pilot plant and ripened for 90 d. In all cheeses the degree of lipolysis, assessed by gas chromatography, increased similarly during ripening. However, the proportion of short-chain fatty acids was higher in the cheeses made with unpasteurized milk, suggesting a higher activity of lipases with positional specificity toward the sn-3 position of the triglyceride, among which milk lipoprotein lipase is found. Similar results were found for most of the volatile compounds, determined by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography flame-ionization detector/mass spectrometry, which constitute the groups of ketones, alcohols, esters, and the group of acids. On the contrary, no effect of mechanical agitation was observed, although some interactions between factors were found.

The extraction is carried out with 75:25 (v/v) tetrahydrofuran:water, a solvent mixture that provides an appropriate balance of hydrogen bonding, dispersion and dipole-dipole interactions to efficiently extract PFCs with chains containing 4-14 carbon atoms from foods. This mixture provided recoveries above 85% from foods including vegetables, fruits, fish, meat and bread; and above 75% from cheese. Clean-up with a weak anion exchange resin and Envi-carb SPE, which were coupled in line for simplicity, was found to minimize matrix effects (viz. enhancement or suppression of electrospray ionization). The target analytes (PFCs) were resolved on a perfluorooctyl phase column that proved effective in separating mass interferences for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in fish and meat samples. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative electrospray ionization mode and used to record two transitions per analyte and one per mass-labeled method internal standard. The target PFCs were quantified from solvent based calibration curves. The limits of detection (LODs) were as low as 1-5 pg analyte g(-1) food; by exception, those for C(4) and C(5) PFCs were somewhat higher (25-30 pg g(-1)) owing to their less favourable mass response. To the best of our knowledge these are among the best LODs for PFCs in foods reported to date. The analysis of a variety of foods revealed contamination with PFCs at levels from 4.5 to 75 pg g(-1) in 25% of samples (fish and packaged spinach).

Biogenic amines were analysed by means of ion-exchange chromatography. A further goal was to identify microbial sources of biogenic amines in the material analysed. Phenotype characterization and repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprinting were used to identify the isolated bacteria. The highest content of tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine was determined in cheeses stored in a ripening cellar at a temperature of 10 degrees C during the whole observation period. Lower biogenic amines content was determined in samples which were moved into a cold storage device (5 degrees C) after 38 days of storage in a ripening cellar (10 degrees C). The lowest concentrations of biogenic amines were detected in cheeses which were moved into a cold storage device (5 degrees C) after 23 days of storage in a ripening cellar (10 degrees C).

20655538,"In the present paper, we have developed a capillary liquid chromatography with MS detection for the determination at ngg⁻¹ levels of four heterocyclic aromatic amines (MeIQx, norharman, harman and harmine), a group of mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds that can potentially be produced in protein-rich food during processing operations. They have been determined in commercial ready-to-eat (RTE) smoked salmon and soft cheese treated with E-beam irradiation. On the basis of experimental design studies and operating conditions of MS detector, best chromatographic conditions were obtained using a Luna® C¹⁸ capillary column (150 mm × 0.3 mm I.D.) with a mixture of acetonitrile-ammonium formate 5 mM pH 3.6 buffer (13:87, v/v) as mobile phase. To improve sensitivity, large injection volumes (20 μL) and injection solutions of low elution strength were employed. Sample preparation procedure included a previous treatment with 1M NaOH, followed by two solid-phase extraction steps; firstly on diatomaceous earth and then on mixed-mode cartridges. Heterocyclic amines were detected neither in irradiated and in non-irradiated samples, indicating that they were not formed by the radiation effect even at doses higher than those indicated in the Food Safety Objective established by regulatory agencies. RTE food samples were spiked at concentration levels in the range 10-30 ngg⁻¹.

The sophisticated approach described above was used in this study to determine and verify the original species of cheeses. Proteins were extracted from three different cheese samples which were produced from cow, sheep and goat milks. The isolated proteins were cleaved with trypsin and the peptides obtained were sequenced and identified by a HPLC-chip/MS/MS microfluidic system. Two different extraction methods and two various chromatographic sorbents packed in plastic chips were studied. Beta-lactoglobulin and four kinds of casein were found in the cheese samples. The species of kappa-casein were identified unambiguously in all the three cheese samples and, thus, kappa-casein can be used to determine the origin of milk of the cheese.

20615342,"The microflora of four batches of traditional Greek Graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. The cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known LAB bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by PCR. All batches were safe according to the European Union regulatory criteria for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. The cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few Streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and Leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. Enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and Enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant LAB from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. Sixteen E. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. In accordance, enterocin B gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin P gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin A, B, P, 31, L50A, and L50B genes. Plantaricin A gene was also amplified from all cheeses. Mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate.

The proposed method makes use of a modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rigged, and safe) procedure that combines isolation of the pesticides and sample clean-up in a single step. Analysis is performed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, acquiring two specific precursor-product ion transitions per target compound. Two main fragment ions for each pesticide were obtained to achieve the identification according to the SANCO guidelines 10684/2009. The method was validated with various food samples, including edible oil, meat, egg, cheese, chocolate, coffee, rice, tree nuts, citric fruits, vegetables, etc. No significant matrix effect was observed for tested pesticides, therefore, matrix-matched calibration was not necessary. Calibration curves were linear and covered from 1 to 20 microg L(-1) for all compounds studied. The average recoveries, measured at 10 microg kg(-1), were in the range 70-120% for all of the compounds tested with relative standard deviations below 20%, while a value of 10 microg kg(-1) has been established as the method limit of quantitation (MLOQ) for all target analytes. Similar trueness and precision results were also obtained for spiking at 200 microg kg(-1). Expanded uncertainty values were in the range 21-27% while the HorRat ratios were below 1.

20552689,"We apply, for first time, the recently developed proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) apparatus as a rapid method for the monitoring of lactic acid fermentation (LAF) of milk. PTR-TOF-MS has been proposed as a very fast, highly sensitive and versatile technique but there have been no reports of its application to dynamic biochemical processes with relevance to the food industry. LAF is a biochemical-physicochemical dynamic process particularly relevant for the dairy industry as it is an important step in the production of many dairy products. Further, LAF is important in the utilization of the by-products of the cheese industry, such as whey wastewaters. We show that PTR-TOF-MS is a powerful method for the monitoring of major volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) formed or depleted during LAF, including acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetoin and 2-propanone, and it also provides information about the evolution of minor VOCs such as acetic acid, 2,3-pentanedione, ethanol, and off-flavor related VOCs such as dimethyl sulfide and furfural. This can be very important considering that the conventional measurement of pH decrease during LAF is often ineffective due to the reduced response of pH electrodes resulting from the formation of protein sediments. Solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) data on the inoculated milk base and final fermented product are also presented to supporting peak identification. We demonstrate that PTR-TOF-MS can be used as a rapid, efficient and non-invasive method for the monitoring of LAF from headspace, supplying important data about the quality of the final product and that it may be used to monitor the efficacy of manufacturing practices.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D000818', 'D005285', 'D019344', 'D048668', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D048249', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Fermentation', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lactobacillus delbrueckii', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Streptococcus thermophilus', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry monitoring of the evolution of volatile compounds during lactic acid fermentation of milk.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20552689,2010

Because SPC are not exposed to the cheese-making process, enzymatic or chemical reactions that can lead to off-flavors are reduced. The objectives of this study were to identify and compare the composition, flavor, and volatile components of 80% protein SPC and whey protein concentrates (WPC). Each pair of 80% SPC and WPC was manufactured from the same lot of milk and this was replicated 3 times. At each replication, spray-dried product from each protein source was collected. Commercial 80% WPC were also collected from several manufacturers for sensory and volatile analyses. A trained sensory panel documented the sensory profiles of the rehydrated powders. Volatile components were extracted by solid-phase microextraction and solvent extraction followed by solvent-assisted flavor evaporation with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-olfactometry. Consumer acceptance testing of acidified 6% protein beverages made with 80% SPC and WPC produced in the pilot plant and with WPC from commercial sources was conducted. The SPC was lower in fat and had a higher pH than the WPC produced in the pilot plant or commercial WPC. Few sensory differences were found between the rehydrated SPC and WPC manufactured in this study, but their flavor profiles were distinct from the flavor of rehydrated commercial WPC. The pilot-plant WPC had higher concentrations of lipid oxidation products compared with SPC, which may be related to the higher fat content of WPC. There was a large difference in appearance between 80% SPC and WPC: solutions of SPC were clear and those of WPC were opaque. Concentrations of lipid oxidation products in commercial WPC were generally higher than those in pilot-plant SPC or WPC. Sensory profiles of the peach-flavored protein beverage included cereal, free fatty acid, and soapy flavors and bitter taste in beverages made from pilot-plant products, whereas cardboard flavors were detected in those made with commercial WPC.

20221853,"Anteiso fatty acids (aFA) are substituted with a methyl group on the antepenultimate carbon of the straight acyl chain. This feature leads to a stereogenic center. The 12-methyltetradecanoic acid (a15:0) and the 14-methylhexadecanoic acid (a17:0) are the most common aFA found in food, although they occur only in very small quantities. In this study we used gas chromatography in combination with a chiral stationary phase to determine the enantiomeric distribution of both a15:0 and a17:0 in the neutral and polar lipids of aquatic food samples and cheese. The best suited column was selected out of four custom-made combinations of heptakis(6-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-2,3-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (beta-TBDM) with different amount and polarity of an achiral polysiloxane. After separation of polar and neutral lipids of the food samples by solid phase extraction, fatty acid methyl esters were prepared and the fatty acid methyl esters were fractionated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Measurements of fractions high in aFA by enantioselective GC/MS in the selected ion monitoring mode verified the dominance of the (S)-enantiomers of a15:0 and a17:0 in both lipid fractions. However (R)-enantiomers were detectable in all samples. The relative proportion of the (R)-enantiomers was up to fivefold higher in the polar lipids than in the neutral lipids. The higher proportions in the polar lipids indicate that microorganisms might be involved in the formation of (R)-aFA.",Lipids,"['D000818', 'D010872', 'D002611', 'D002851', 'D004041', 'D005227', 'D005395', 'D005502', 'D005504', 'D008401', 'D057927', 'D008055', 'D008697', 'D008968', 'D021241', 'D013237']","['Animals', 'Caniformia', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dietary Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fish Oils', 'Food', 'Food Analysis', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Lipids', 'Methane', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Stereoisomerism']",Enantioselective analysis of chiral anteiso fatty acids in the polar and neutral lipids of food.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000031', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analogs & derivatives', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20221853,2010

20043637,"Branched chain fatty acids (iso- and anteiso-fatty acids) are common minor compounds of the lipids found in dairy products and fish (<1-3%) and major fatty acids of Gram-positive bacteria. Their presence in food has been associated with bacterial sources. Bacterial lipids usually consist of polar lipids and virtually no triacylglycerides while food lipids are predominantly composed of triacylglycerides. In this study, we examined the difference in the iso- or anteiso-fatty acid content and composition of neutral and polar lipids in fish and cheese samples. Neutral lipids (triacylglycerides) were separated from the polar lipids (phospholipids) by means of solid-phase extraction (SPE). Deuterium-labeled internal standards were used to verify the successful performance of the accelerated solvent extraction and particularly the SPE. The separated lipid fractions were transformed into their corresponding fatty acid methyl esters, and the concentrations of seven iso- and anteiso-fatty acids were determined by means of gas chromatography coupled to electron ionization mass spectrometry operated in the selected ion monitoring mode (GC/EI-MS-SIM). No coelutions of branched chain fatty acids with other fatty acids were obtained on the medium polar column used for quantification. The branched chain fatty acid content of 17 cheese and 7 fish samples ranged between 0.2% and 1.9% in polar lipids and between 0.1% and 1.7% in neutral lipids. The concentration of total branched chain fatty acids in fish was 2-10 times lower than that found in cheeses, and the relative distribution of iso-17:0 and iso-15:0 increased compared to their anteiso homologues.

20038704,"Lipolysis plays an important role in the formation of cheese flavor. In Emmental cheese, the main part of lipolysis has been associated with the presence of Propionibacterium freudenreichii, a species used as a ripening culture. Our aim was to identify the most probable lipolytic esterase(s) involved in cheese lipolysis by P. freudenreichii. Since cheese lipolysis mainly occurs during P. freudenreichii growth, we hypothesized that P. freudenreichii possesses secreted lipolytic esterase(s). For 12 putative esterase genes previously identified from the genome of P. freudenreichii CIRM1, the level of expression was quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, and the subcellular localization of esterases was predicted in silico. The esterase activity in extracellular and intracellular extracts of P. freudenreichii was characterized by zymography, and the extracellular esterases were identified by mass spectrometry. Finally, the best candidate was overexpressed in the same strain. All of the 12 genes encoding putative esterases were expressed. Esterase PF#279 was predicted to be secreted in the medium, PF#774 to be surface exposed, and the 10 remaining putative esterases to be intracellular. Zymography revealed that esterase activities in culture supernatant differed from the ones detected in intracellular extracts. PF#279 was identified as the sole esterase present in culture supernatant. Transformed P. freudenreichii CIRM1 clones overexpressing PF#279 showed 5 to 8 times more lipolytic activity on milk fat than the wild-type strain. Combining in silico, biochemical, and genetic approaches, we showed that PF#279 is the sole secreted esterase in P. freudenreichii and is active on milk fat.

The SPC and WPC were manufactured in triplicate with each pair of serum and traditional whey protein manufactured from the same lot of milk. At each replication, SPC and WPC were spray dried (SD) and freeze dried (FD) to determine the effect of the heat used in spray drying on sensory properties. A trained sensory panel documented the sensory profiles of rehydrated SD or FD powders. Volatile components were extracted by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and solvent extraction followed by solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE) with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-olfactometry. Whey protein concentrates had higher fat content, calcium, and glycomacropeptide content than SPC. Color differences (Hunter L, a, b) were not evident between SPC and WPC powders, but when rehydrated, SPC solutions were clear, whereas WPC solutions were cloudy. No consistent differences were documented in sensory profiles of SD and FD SPC and WPC. The SD WPC had low but distinct buttery (diacetyl) and cardboard flavors, whereas the SD SPC did not. Sensory profiles of both rehydrated SD products were bland and lower in overall aroma and cardboard flavor compared with the commercial WPC. Twenty-nine aroma impact compounds were identified in the SPC and WPC. Lipid and protein oxidation products were present in both products. The SPC and WPC manufactured in this study had lower total volatiles and lower concentrations of many lipid oxidation compounds when compared with commercial WPC. Our results suggest that when SPC and WPC are manufactured under controlled conditions in a similar manner from the same milk using the same ultrafiltration equipment, there are few sensory differences but distinct compositional and physical property differences that may influence functionality. Furthermore, flavor (sensory and instrumental) properties of both pilot-scale manufactured protein powders were different from commercial powders suggesting the role of other influencing factors (e.g., milk supply, processing equipment, sanitation).",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002118', 'D002364', 'D002611', 'D002849', 'D005223', 'D005511', 'D005612', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D009812', 'D010446', 'D012677', 'D012903', 'D013649', 'D000067816']","['Animals', 'Calcium', 'Caseins', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Fats', 'Food Handling', 'Freeze Drying', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Odorants', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Sensation', 'Smell', 'Taste', 'Whey Proteins']","Comparison of composition, sensory, and volatile components of thirty-four percent whey protein and milk serum protein concentrates.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19762792,2009

Ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) is a new generation of separation techniques that takes full advantage of chromatographic principles to increase speed flow which drastically reduce analysis time. The aim of the present work was to validate a rapid method of UHPLC to detect the presence of biogenic amines and polyamines in food. Different food matrixes (wine, fish, cheese, and dry fermented sausage) were used in order to test the versatility of the method. The UHPLC method described in this article has been demonstrated as a reliable procedure to determine 12 biogenic amines and polyamines in less than 7min of chromatographic elution. The method provides a satisfactory linearity and chromatographic sensitivity with a detection limit lower than 0.2mg/L and a determination limit falling below 0.3mg/L for all amines. The precision, in terms of relative standard deviation, was lower than 5% and the accuracy, as mean recovery, was between 93% and 98%, depending on the food matrix.",Journal of chromatography.

Since the enzyme is extracted from hen egg white, lysozyme has to be declared on food product labels as a potential allergen. Here, a method is reported that combines immunocapture purification and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis for the detection of lysozyme in cheese samples. Cheese extracts were treated with magnetic particles coated with a monoclonal antibody directed against lysozyme. After immunocapture purification, lysozyme was detected by MALDI-TOF-MS. The limit of detection of the assay was about 5mg/kg lysozyme in cheese. The method reliably distinguished between cheese samples which had been produced with and without lysozyme. Thus, the novel assay allows the reliable, sensitive, and specific detection of lysozyme in a food matrix. The assay could be easily adapted to other target peptides and proteins in complex food matrices and, therefore, has a broad application potential, e.g. for the analysis of allergens.","Journal of chromatography.

19620638,"Improved cheese flavor has been attributed to the addition of adjunct cultures, which provide certain key enzymes for proteolysis and affect the dynamics of starter and nonstarter cultures. Infrared microspectroscopy provides unique fingerprint-like spectra for cheese samples and allows for rapid monitoring of cheese composition during ripening. The objective was to use infrared microspectroscopy and multivariate analysis to evaluate the effect of adjunct cultures on Swiss cheeses during ripening. Swiss cheeses, manufactured using a commercial starter culture combination and 1 of 3 adjunct Lactobacillus spp., were evaluated at d 1, 6, 30, 60, and 90 of ripening. Cheese samples (approximately 20 g) were powdered with liquid nitrogen and homogenized using water and organic solvents, and the water-soluble components were separated. A 3-microL aliquot of the extract was applied onto a reflective microscope slide, vacuum-dried, and analyzed by infrared microspectroscopy. The infrared spectra (900 to 1,800 cm(-1)) produced specific absorption profiles that allowed for discrimination among different cheese samples. Cheeses manufactured with adjunct cultures showed more uniform and consistent spectral profiles, leading to the formation of tight clusters by pattern-recognition analysis (soft independent modeling of class analogy) as compared with cheeses with no adjuncts, which exhibited more spectral variability among replicated samples. In addition, the soft independent modeling of class analogy discriminating power indicated that cheeses were differentiated predominantly based on the band at 1,122 cm(-1), which was associated with S-O vibrations. The greatest changes in the chemical profile of each cheese occurred between d 6 and 30 of warm-room ripening. The band at 1,412 cm(-1), which was associated with acidic AA, had the greatest contribution to differentiation, indicating substantial changes in levels of proteolysis during warm-room ripening in addition to propionic acid, acetic acid, and eye formation.

19307613,"The safeguard of river buffalo Mozzarella cheese, a Protected Designation of Origin dairy product, has prompted an analytical study to trace the milk and curd used as raw material in cheesemaking. This is to prevent the illegal use of milk or curd from different geographical areas outside of those indicated in the official production protocol. For this purpose, we studied primary proteolysis occurring in fresh and frozen milk and curd to identify a molecular marker that could indicate the raw material used. Whole casein from frozen river buffalo milk was separated using cation-exchange chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE, and a protein component with an estimated molecular weight of 15.3 kDa was detected. This protein component was revealed in fresh river buffalo milk as a faint electrophoresis band, which drastically increased in intensity in refrigerated and frozen milk as well as in curd and was found to be associated with beta-CN through hydrophobic interaction. By using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight peptide mass mapping, this component was identified as the C-terminal fragment f(69-209) of beta-CN (expected molecular weight of 15,748.8 Da). beta-Casein f(69-209), originating from the early hydrolysis of Lys(68)-Ser(69) by plasmin, has no counterpart in bovine milk. The increased rate of hydrolysis by plasmin toward the cleavage site Lys(68)-Ser(69) has to be ascribed to the elevated proline content of the peptide 61-73. The favored production of beta-CN f(69-209) has also drawn attention to the complementary proteose peptone beta-CN f(1-68) that is presumed to play a physiological role in inducing milk secretion similar to that of beta-CN f(1-29). The higher in vivo and in vitro production rate, compared with gamma(1)-CN formation, indicates that beta-CN f(69-209) and its complementary fragment are candidate molecular markers to evaluate milk and curd freshness.

The recovery rate for standard phosphatidylcholines was approximately 90% and cross-contamination from neutral lipids was negligible. The method was applied to cheese samples. Quantitative amounts of individual fatty acids in the phospholipid fraction were <0.002-0.29% of total lipids from camembert, <0.002-0.12% of total lipids from mozzarella, and <0.002-0.18% of total lipids in a goat cream cheese. Differences in the fatty acid pattern of neutral and polar lipids were detected. The quantity of the fatty acids determined in the phospholipid fraction was divided by the factor 0.7 in order to convert the fatty acid content into the phospholipid content of the cheese samples. This factor is based on the contribution of 16:0 to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). The resulting DPPC equivalents (DPPC(eq)) were found to be representative for the average contribution of fatty acids to all classes of phospholipids in dairy products. Using this approach, the phospholipid content of lipids from mozzarella, camembert, and goat cream cheese was 0.60%, 1.42% and 0.79%, respectively.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D002611', 'D004952', 'D005227', 'D008401', 'D010713', 'D010743', 'D012822', 'D052616', 'D014280', 'D014304']","['Cheese', 'Esters', 'Fatty Acids', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Phosphatidylcholines', 'Phospholipids', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Triglycerides', 'Triolein']",Quantification of fatty acids as methyl esters and phospholipids in cheese samples after separation of triacylglycerides and phospholipids.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000302', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'isolation & purification', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264173,2009

To gain further insight in protein determinants involved in biofilm formation by this coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, a comparative proteomic analysis between planktonic and sessile cells was performed. With the use of a protocol previously developed, protein patterns of the cytoplasmic and cell envelope fractions were compared by 2-DE. Following protein identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analyses, this study revealed differences in expression levels of 89 distinct proteins with 55 up-expressed and 34 down-expressed proteins in biofilm compared to planktonic cells. Most proteins differentially expressed were related to nitrogen and carbon metabolisms. Besides amino acid biosynthesis and protein translation, protein determinants related to protein secretion were up-expressed in biofilm, suggesting a more active protein trafficking in sessile cells. While up-expression of several enzymes involved in pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathways was observed in biofilm, connections with unexpected metabolic routes were further unravelled. Indeed, this proteomic analysis allowed identifying novel proteins that could be involved in a previously uncovered exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway in S. xylosus as well as several enzymes related to polyketide biosynthesis.

Since the last review in 2005, proteomics has mainly been applied to describe minor proteins in the bovine milk fat globule membrane and soluble proteins in human colostrum. At least 130 new minor proteins have been identified. These proteins play roles in cell signaling, host defense, and transport as suggested by sequence homology. Proteomic approaches have also been applied to milk of other species such as donkey, horse, and marsupial. Peptides produced in food matrices that can exhibit functional or bioactive properties have been identified as have the proteases leading to their release in situ. However, the most spectacular proteomic development has been in the field of bacteria used in dairy products. Proteomics has resulted in the establishment of reference maps to detect strain-to-strain variations and to elucidate the mechanisms of in vitro and in vivo adaptation to environmental conditions. Proteomic analysis of bacteria entrapped in cheese has been achieved and revealed which predominant metabolic pathways are active depending on the strain.

To identify the molecules underlying that so-called kokumi sensation, a sensomics approach was applied on the water-soluble extract (WSE44) of GC44 by combining gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with analytical sensory tools. HPLC-MS/MS experiments on GPC fractions inducing a kokumi sensation when tasted in an aqueous biomimetic taste recombinant solution (rWSE44) enabled the identification of 8 alpha-L-glutamyl and 10 gamma-L-glutamyl dipeptides as candidate kokumi-enhancing molecules.

19109300,"This study investigated the potential application of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR 4,000-900 cm(-1)) for the determination of milk coagulation properties (MCP), titratable acidity (TA), and pH in Brown Swiss milk samples (n = 1,064). Because MCP directly influence the efficiency of the cheese-making process, there is strong industrial interest in developing a rapid method for their assessment. Currently, the determination of MCP involves time-consuming laboratory-based measurements, and it is not feasible to carry out these measurements on the large numbers of milk samples associated with milk recording programs. Mid-infrared spectroscopy is an objective and nondestructive technique providing rapid real-time analysis of food compositional and quality parameters. Analysis of milk rennet coagulation time (RCT, min), curd firmness (a(30), mm), TA (SH degrees/50 mL; SH degrees = Soxhlet-Henkel degree), and pH was carried out, and MIR data were recorded over the spectral range of 4,000 to 900 cm(-1). Models were developed by partial least squares regression using untreated and pretreated spectra. The MCP, TA, and pH prediction models were improved by using the combined spectral ranges of 1,600 to 900 cm(-1), 3,040 to 1,700 cm(-1), and 4,000 to 3,470 cm(-1). The root mean square errors of cross-validation for the developed models were 2.36 min (RCT, range 24.9 min), 6.86 mm (a(30), range 58 mm), 0.25 SH degrees/50 mL (TA, range 3.58 SH degrees/50 mL), and 0.07 (pH, range 1.15). The most successfully predicted attributes were TA, RCT, and pH. The model for the prediction of TA provided approximate prediction (R(2) = 0.66), whereas the predictive models developed for RCT and pH could discriminate between high and low values (R(2) = 0.59 to 0.62). It was concluded that, although the models require further development to improve their accuracy before their application in industry, MIR spectroscopy has potential application for the assessment of RCT, TA, and pH during routine milk analysis in the dairy industry. The implementation of such models could be a means of improving MCP through phenotypic-based selection programs and to amend milk payment systems to incorporate MCP into their payment criteria.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D012085', 'D006863', 'D016014', 'D008892', 'D013055']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chymosin', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Linear Models', 'Milk', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared']","Prediction of coagulation properties, titratable acidity, and pH of bovine milk using mid-infrared spectroscopy.","[None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19109300,2009
19109261,"Whey protein, at one time considered a by-product of the cheese-making process, is now commonly used in foods for its thickening and emulsifying properties. Currently, approximately 30% of these proteinaceous resources remain under-utilized. Previously, an acidified, thermally treated whey protein concentrate (mWPC) was developed to produce a cold-set thickening ingredient. Mass spectroscopy revealed an approximate 2.5-fold decrease in the lactosylation of beta-lactoglobulin in mWPC starting materials compared with commercial whey protein concentrates, manufactured at a higher pH. Potentially, this should increase the number of reactive sites that remain available for carbohydrate attachment. With this study, the formation of glycoprotein complexes was demonstrated between the mWPC ingredient and lactose, naturally occurring in mWPC powders, or between mWPC protein components with dextran (35 to 45 and 100 to 200 kDa) materials at low pH. In fact, additional dry heating of mWPC powders showed a 3-fold increase in the amount of lactosylated beta-lactoglobulin. Evidence of Maillard reactivity was suggested using colorimetry, o-phthaldialdehyde assays, and sodium dodecyl sulfate PAGE followed by glycoprotein staining. Resultant glycoprotein dispersions exhibited altered functionality, in which case steady shear and small amplitude oscillatory rheology parameters were shown to be dependent on the specific reducing sugar present. Furthermore, the emulsion stability of mWPC-dextran fractions was 2 to 3 times greater than either mWPC or commercial WPC dispersions based on creaming index values. The water-holding capacity of all test samples decreased with additional heating steps; however, mWPC-dextran powders still retained nearly 6 times their weight of water. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that mWPC-dextran conjugates formed a porous network that differed significantly from the dense network observed with mWPC samples. This porosity likely affected both the rheological and water-binding properties of mWPC-dextran complexes. Taken together, these results suggest that the functionality of mWPC ingredients can be enhanced by conjugation with carbohydrate materials at low pH, especially with regard to improving the emulsifying attributes.",Journal of dairy science,"['D050260', 'D003124', 'D004655', 'D005524', 'D006031', 'D006863', 'D013058', 'D008855', 'D008894', 'D014867', 'D000067816']","['Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Colorimetry', 'Emulsions', 'Food Technology', 'Glycosylation', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Milk Proteins', 'Water', 'Whey Proteins']",Glycosylation and expanded utility of a modified whey protein ingredient via carbohydrate conjugation at low pH.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19109261,2009

19021793,"Farmstead Cheddar cheeses with natural bandage wrappings have a distinctive flavor profile that is appealing to many consumers. An earthy/bell pepper (EBP) flavor has been previously recognized in some of these cheeses. This study characterized the alkylmethoxypyrazine compounds causing EBP flavor in Farmstead Cheddar cheeses. Eight cheeses were divided into inner, outer, rind, and wrapper sections, and tested for descriptive sensory and instrumental analyses. To assess reproducibility of EBP flavor, cheeses from the same facilities were purchased and tested after 6 and 12 mo. EBP flavor was detected in four out of 8 Farmstead Cheddar cheeses by a trained sensory panel. 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine were identified as the main sources of EBP flavor in these cheeses by GC/O and GC/MS. In general, those alkylmethoxypyrazines were prevalent in the wrapper (106 to 730 ppb) and rind (39 to 444 ppb) sections of the cheeses. They were either not detected in inner and outer sections of the cheeses or were present at low concentrations. These results suggest that 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine and 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine are formed near the surface of the cheeses and migrate into the cheese during ripening. Threshold values in water and whole milk were 1 and 16 ppt for 2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine, and 0.4 and 2.3 ppt for 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, respectively.

Food samples were randomly acquired in 12 cities of Catalonia between March and June of 2006. HCB levels were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. The dietary intake of HCB was subsequently estimated for the population of Catalonia, and the results were compared with those of a survey performed in 2000. The highest HCB concentrations were found in oils and fats, fish and seafood, and dairy products, with mean levels of 0.481, 0.330, and 0.284 ng/g of fresh weight, respectively. HCB intake was estimated for four population groups: children, adolescents, adults, and seniors (aged >65 years). The highest and lowest HCB intake corresponded to children and seniors, respectively. Similar results were found in our 2000 survey. For a standard male adult of 70-kg body weight, in the 2000 study, total dietary intake of HCB was 166.2 ng/day (2.4 ng/kg of body weight per day), whereas in the current survey the intake was 71.6 ng/day (1.0 ng/kg of body weight per day). On a body-weight basis, it means a decrease of 57%, which was mainly due to the important reductions in the contribution of dairy products (mainly cheese), as well as those of meat and meat products and fish and seafood.

18848597,"The objective was to estimate oral Al bioavailability from tea infusion in the rat, using the tracer (26)Al. (26)Al citrate was injected into tea leaves. An infusion was prepared from the dried leaves and given intra-gastrically to rats which received concurrent intravenous (27)Al infusion. Oral Al bioavailability (F) was calculated from the area under the (26)Al, compared to (27)Al, serum concentration x time curves. Bioavailability from tea averaged 0.37%; not significantly different from water (F=0.3%), or basic sodium aluminum phosphate (SALP) in cheese (F=0.1-0.3%), but greater than acidic SALP in a biscuit (F=0.1%). Time to maximum serum (26)Al concentration was 1.25, 1.5, 8 and 4.8h, respectively. These results of oral Al bioavailability x daily consumption by the human suggest tea can provide a significant amount of the Al that reaches systemic circulation. This can allow distribution to its target organs of toxicity, the central nervous, skeletal and hematopoietic systems.

Histamine in food samples was efficiently extracted with a methanol-phosphate buffer solution (50:50, v/v) at 60 degrees C for 30 min, and purified with Waters Oasis MCX solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. The limit of quantification for this method is 0.2 mg/kg, which is very sensitive for histamine determination. With the ""sandwich"" injection program, 3.7% of relative standard deviation (RSD) was achieved by five replicative determinations of a sample blank spiked with 0.25 mg/kg histamine standard. Histamine in food samples such as fumitory skipjack and mackerel was analyzed with relative recoveries over 95% at spiking level of 150 mg/kg, as well as canned tuna fish and cheese with relative recoveries up to 98% at spiking levels of 0.50 and 5.0 mg/kg, respectively.

18641203,"To investigate the degree of absorption of flavan-3-ols in the small intestine, human subjects with an ileostomy ingested 200 mg of Polyphenon E, a green tea extract, after which ileal fluid and urine, collected over a 24-h period, were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array and mass spectrometric detection. The data obtained indicated that although approximately 40% of flavan-3-ol intake is recovered in ileal fluid, substantial quantities are absorbed in the small intestine. Moreover, 14 urinary metabolites, comprising sulfates, glucuronide, and methylated derivatives, were identified and quantified. All were metabolites of (epi)catechin or (epi)gallocatechin, representing 47 +/- 2% and 26 +/- 9%, respectively, of the ingested parent compound. These high recoveries indicate that these flavan-3-ols absorbed in the small intestine are much more bioavailable than most dietary flavonoids. No 3-O-galloylated flavan-3-ols or their metabolites were detected in urine. The absence of urinary flavan-3-ol metabolites after ingestion of 200 mg of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate indicates that there is no removal of the 3-O-galloyl group in vivo, and hence, this does not account for the high urinary recovery of (epi)gallocatechin metabolites after ingestion of Polyphenon E. Increasing the intake of Polyphenon E, by feeding doses of 200, 500, and 1500 mg, led to increased urinary excretion of (epi)catechin metabolites but not metabolites of (epi)gallocatechin. Coingestion of 200 mg of Polyphenon E with bread, cheese, or glucose did not significantly modify the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of flavan-3-ols.

Analyses of NIST and BCR reference materials demonstrated the accuracy of this technique. The highest copper levels were found in dried fruit and legumes, followed by organ meats, molluscs and crustaceans, cephalopods, cereals and sausages, respectively. In cereals, legumes and fruit, copper levels increased significantly with increasing levels of protein and decreasing carbohydrate content (p < 0.001). In meat and meat by-products, copper concentrations found in organ meats were significantly higher (p < 0.01). In fresh fish products, copper levels in shellfish were significantly higher than those measured in fish (p < 0.001). In vegetables, the copper concentrations found in mushrooms were significantly higher (p < 0.005). Mean copper concentrations analysed in cheese were statistically higher than those determined in other dairy products (p < 0.01). In beverages, copper levels determined in rum and juices were significantly higher (p < 0.001). Beverages for which a vegetable component was directly used in their manufacturing process (juices, wines and beers) had statistically higher copper levels when compared with fresh drinks. The daily dietary intake (DDI) of copper in the Andalusian diet was 1979 mug day(-1) per person. Cereals, meat, meat by-products and vegetables are the food categories that are the main source of copper in the daily diet. Taking into account the dietary reference intakes and upper levels (900 and 10, 000 mug Cu day(-1) for healthy adults, respectively), the mean copper DDI found indicate that for most of healthy adult individuals from the area, no adverse effects occur in relation to copper nutrition (deficiency or toxicity).

18553884,"Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) has been utilized by the food industry in many applications to extract, fractionate, and recover compounds from various food matrices. However, little research has been conducted using SFE as an alternative process for producing reduced-fat cheese. Lipids in cheeses may be selectively extracted due to the nonpolar properties of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), without leaving residual chemicals as is the case in solvent extraction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence on the extraction process due to cheese variety and protein breakdown by age. A Latin square design was utilized to test the extractability of lipids from Parmesan and Cheddar cheeses, aged young (9-10 months) or old (24 months). Extraction took place in a 500 mL SFE vessel using 100 g of grated cheese samples. The SFE parameters of the extraction were 350 bar, 35 degrees C, and supercritical carbon dioxide at a flow rate of 20 g/min for 55 min. Compositional analysis measured all treated samples and controls of total lipids, lipid profiling, total protein, protein/peptide analysis, moisture, ash, and pH. Cheese type was a major variable in fat extraction. The extraction in Cheddar showed an average fat reduction of 53.56% for young cheese, whereas that in old Cheddar was 47.90%.

18540611,"This study provides a contribution to hard-type cheese starter culture production through the use of a freeze-dried culture in the ripening of hard-type cheeses. The effect of initial cell concentration, ripening temperature, and cell immobilization of kefir on the degree of openness, mold spoilage, microbial associations, physicochemical characteristics, and aroma-related compounds was studied. Use of kefir starter cultures resulted in cheese with an increased shelf life and resistance to spoilage as compared to control cheeses without kefir inoculants. Furthermore, the freeze-dried kefir culture improved aroma, taste, and texture characteristics while increasing the degree of openness in comparison to traditional hard-type cheese products. The kefir culture resulted in an increase in counts of total aerobic bacteria, yeasts and molds, lactococci, and lactobacilli until the 15th day of ripening. From then on, only lactobacilli counts increased, reaching levels up to 9.17 log CFU/g in cheeses ripened at 5 degrees C using freeze-dried kefir cells immobilized on casein. SPME-GC/MS analysis revealed major differences in volatile composition, especially with regard to alcohols (up to 75%), carbonyl compounds (up to 75%), and esters (up to 64%) between cheeses made with kefir cells and cheeses made without kefir inoculants.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D001419', 'D002611', 'D043302', 'D005285', 'D005511', 'D005516', 'D005612', 'D005658', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D013649', 'D013696']","['Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Cheese', 'Cultured Milk Products', 'Fermentation', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'Freeze Drying', 'Fungi', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Taste', 'Temperature']",Production of hard-type cheese using free or immobilized freeze-dried kefir cells as a starter culture.,"[None, 'Q000302', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000302', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'isolation & purification', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18540611,2008
18455822,"The microbial diversity of sixty-three Natural Whey Cultures (NWCs) for the manufacture of Caciocavallo Silano cheese PDO was studied. The NWCs were collected from different dairies covering the whole territory of PDO production including five different regions of southern Italy. The microbial species diversity was determined by direct DNA extraction from NWCs and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). DGGE and DHPLC fingerprinting yielded the same results in terms of number of bands/peaks and specific migration/retention time of the amplicons. The DHPLC technique was used in this study for the first time to assess a food-related mixed microbial community by a culture-independent approach and proved to be at least as effective as DGGE in profiling species diversity in NWCs. Cluster analysis of DGGE and DHPLC data revealed that the species-related groups of similarity were not dependent on the geographical origin of the NWCs. The presence of three groups of 10-14 NWCs at 100% of species similarity indicated that some species associations are very commonly occurring in the NWCs for Caciocavallo Silano cheese PDO. A RAPD-PCR analysis of the NWCs was also performed for the members of the above groups and it showed that, though characterized by the same species diversity, most of the identical NWCs included different biotypes. The sequences of DGGE bands and DHPLC peaks revealed the occurrence of mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. helveticus and Streptococcus thermophilus even though the mesophilic Lactococcus lactis also occurred in some NWCs. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the microbial diversity of NWCs used for the Caciocavallo Silano PDO cheese is not high, it is not dependent on the geographical origin and the same microbial species occur within the territory examined. The microbiota of fermented PDO products and its possible link with territory should be studied case by case in order to have useful evidences for the assessment of product quality and authenticity.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D002611', 'D002851', 'D016000', 'D015169', 'D004269', 'D017753', 'D016521', 'D005516', 'D007218', 'D007778', 'D008894', 'D017422', 'D013045', 'D013291', 'D000067816']","['Cheese', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Ecosystem', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Food Microbiology', 'Industrial Microbiology', 'Lactobacillus', 'Milk Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Species Specificity', 'Streptococcus', 'Whey Proteins']",Microbial diversity in natural whey cultures used for the production of Caciocavallo Silano PDO cheese.,"['Q000382', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000235', None]","['microbiology', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, None, 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18455822,2008
18436363,"Oral aluminum (Al) bioavailability from drinking water has been previously estimated, but there is little information on Al bioavailability from foods. It was suggested that oral Al bioavailability from drinking water is much greater than from foods. The objective was to further test this hypothesis. Oral Al bioavailability was determined in the rat from basic [26Al]-sodium aluminum phosphate (basic SALP) in a process cheese. Consumption of approximately 1g cheese containing 1.5% or 3% basic SALP resulted in oral Al bioavailability (F) of approximately 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, and time to maximum serum 26Al concentration (Tmax) of 8-9h. These Al bioavailability results were intermediate to previously reported results from drinking water (F approximately 0.3%) and acidic-SALP incorporated into a biscuit (F approximately 0.1%), using the same methods. Considering the similar oral bioavailability of Al from food vs. water, and their contribution to the typical human's daily Al intake ( approximately 95% and 1.5%, respectively), these results suggest food contributes much more Al to systemic circulation, and potential Al body burden, than does drinking water.

18355669,"Whey, a by-product of the cheese industry usually disposed as waste, is a source of biological and functional valuable proteins. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potentiality of three lactic acid bacteria strains to design a starter culture for developing functional whey-based drinks. Fermentations were performed at 37 and 42 degrees C for 24h in reconstituted whey powder (RW). Carbohydrates, organic acids and amino acids concentrations during fermentation were evaluated by RP-HPLC. Proteolytic activity was measured by the o-phthaldialdehyde test and hydrolysis of whey proteins was analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. The studied strains grew well (2-3log cfu/ml) independently of the temperature used. Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 804 consumed 12% of the initial lactose concentration and produced the highest amount of lactic acid (45 mmol/l) at 24h. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 454 was the most proteolytic (91 microg Leu/ml) strain and released the branched chain amino acids Leu and Val. In contrast, Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and S. thermophilus CRL 804 consumed most of the amino acids present in whey. The studied strains were able to degrade the major whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin being degraded in a greater extent (2.2-3.4-fold) than beta-lactoglobulin. Two starter cultures were evaluated for their metabolic and proteolytic activities in RW. Both cultures acidified and reduced the lactose content in whey in a greater extent than the strains alone. The amino acid release was higher (86 microg/ml) for the starter SLb (strains CRL 804+CRL 454) than for SLa (strains CRL 804+CRL 636, 37 microg/ml). Regarding alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin degradation, no differences were observed as compared to the values obtained with the single cultures.

The composition of the plasticizers in the gaskets was analysed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) and phthalates were determined in the homogenized food samples. ESBO was the principal plasticizer in five of the gaskets; in 14 it was phthalates. ESBO was found in seven of the food samples at concentrations from 6 to 100 mg kg(-1). The highest levels (91-100 mg kg(-1)) were in oily foods such as garlic, chilli or olives in oil. Phthalates, i.e. di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP) and di-iso-nonylphthalates (DINP), were found in seven samples at 6-173 mg kg(-1). The highest concentrations (99-173 mg kg(-1)) were in products of garlic and tomatoes in oil and in fatty food products such as sauce béarnaise and peanut butter.

Solutions containing lysozyme and dextran were incubated at 60 degrees C and at 79% relative humidity. Gel permeation chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to follow the glycosylation process. Under optimum conditions 3.7 mol of dextran were coupled to 1 mol of lysozyme. Lytic activity of the conjugate against the cell wall of Micrococcus luteus was about 62% of that of native lysozyme. Evaluation of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against test microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) in culture media indicated a progressive increase in antimicrobial activity, with an increase in enzyme-conjugate concentration. The lysozyme-dextran conjugate was also effective against E. coli in a natural food system, as it reduced the bacterial count by 3 log in cheese curd after 40 days of storage. Unlike E. coli, the antimicrobial action of lysozyme against S. aureus was not improved by conjugation with dextran in both in vitro and in vivo tests. Antimicrobial activity of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against gram-negative bacteria is probably related to the remaining lytic activity as well as the excellent surfactant properties of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate.

18218739,"Yeasts are commonly detected in cheese. Two yeast species, Kluyveromyces lactis and Pichia fermentans, were isolated at high populations from raw-milk Cantalet cheese, a French Protected Denomination of Origin hard cheese. To investigate the interest of these 2 species as adjunct cultures to promote flavor development of Cantalet cheese, they were added at 10(5) cfu/mL to microfiltered milk. The global microbiological, biochemical, and flavor changes induced by the presence of the yeasts in cheese were determined. Adjunct yeasts were present at 10(6) cfu/g in curd, declined to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/g in cheese, and did not influence gross composition, content of free amino acids, or content of free fatty acids. By using 8-way gas chromatography-olfactometry in parallel with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 30 odorous compounds of Cantalet cheese were identified. The olfactory profiles of K. lactis cheeses contained significantly greater levels of 8 odorous compounds (ethanol, ethyl hexanoate, 4 aldehydes, and 2 branched-chain acids) compared with the control and P. fermentans cheeses. Sensory analysis of cheeses flavor discriminated K. lactis cheeses on only 2 attributes (acetaldehyde and alcohol odors).

In addition, the enantiomeric composition of 11 atropisomeric PCB has been determined for the first time in this type of product, using heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatography and 2 enantioselective columns for the unambiguous determination of both enantiomers. Results showed a deviation from the racemic composition for PCB 135, 136, 176, 171, and 183 in the samples analyzed. Whereas PCB 135, 136, and 176 showed an enrichment of the first eluted enantiomer, congeners 171 and 183 showed an enrichment of the first or second eluted enantiomer depending on the dairy product and species. The remaining congeners analyzed (PCB 84, 91, 95, 132, 149, and 174) did not present a clear enrichment of any of the enantiomers. Therefore, differences in the enantiomeric composition of some of the target atropisomeric PCB have been found among the 3 species and among the milk samples and the related dairy products analyzed.

Fluorescence spectroscopy is able to determine various properties of foods without use of chemicals and time-consuming sample preparation.

The interpretation of fluorescence spectroscopic data is complex due to absorbance by other molecular groups, changes caused by variation in the sample matrix, etc. It is illustrated how advanced data analytical techniques are required to obtain optimal interpretation of the data.

18096925,"The aim of this experiment was to study the effect of the addition, to milk, of an essential oil (EO) obtained from the hydrodistillation of plants collected from a mountain natural pasture on the milk and cheese sensory properties. The EO was mainly composed of terpenoid compounds (67 of the 95 compounds identified) as well as ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, alkanes, and benzenic compounds. In milk, the addition of this EO at the concentration of 0.1 microL/L did not influence its sensory properties, whereas at 1.0 microL/L, sensory properties were modified. In cheeses, the effect of adding EO into milk was studied in an experimental dairy plant allowing the production of small Cantal-type cheeses (10 kg) in 3 vats processed in parallel. The control (C) vat contained 110 L of raw milk; in the other 2 vats, 0.1 microL/L (EO1) or 3.0 microL/L (EO30) of EO were added to 110 L of the same milk. Six replicates were performed. After 5 mo of ripening, chemical and sensory analyses were carried out on the cheeses, including determination of the volatile compounds by dynamic headspace combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The EO did not influence the sensory properties of the cheeses at the lower concentration (EO1). However, the EO30 cheeses had a more intense odor and aroma, both characterized as ""mint/chlorophyll"" and ""thyme/oregano."" These unusual odors and aromas originated directly from the EO added. In total, 152 compounds desorbing from cheese were found, of which 41 had been added with the EO; in contrast, 54 compounds of the EO were not recovered in the cheese. Few volatile compounds desorbing from cheeses, other than the added compounds, were affected by EO addition. Among them, 2-butanol, propanol, and 3-heptanone suggested a slight effect of the EO on lipid catabolism.

17881674,"Nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. In this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. The objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in vitro and in situ assays. Milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid 8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. In addition, the tolerance to salts (NaCl and KCl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. Four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. In in vitro assays, most strains acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. Fast strains decreased milk pH to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. This group consisted mostly of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. Approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. Peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. Most strains showed salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. The Lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening.

Overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products.

17874237,"This paper describes the extension of a previously published method based on liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) from 39 to currently 87 analytes. Besides the mycotoxins for which regulated concentrations exist, the method now comprises not only almost all mycotoxins for which standards are commercially available, but also a number of other important metabolites produced by fungi involved in food spoilage. The method is based on a single extraction step using an acidified acetonitrile/water mixture followed by analysis of the diluted crude extract. Method performance characteristics were determined after spiking breadcrumbs as model matrix at multiple concentration levels. With very few exceptions, coefficients of variation of the whole procedure of <5% and repeatabilities at the highest spiking level of <7% were obtained. Limits of detection ranged between 0.02 and 225 microg kg(-1). The quantitative determination of ergopeptides was disturbed by epimerization due to the acidic conditions. From the remaining 77 analytes, the apparent recoveries of nine substances deviated significantly from the CEN target range of 70-110% due to incomplete extraction and/or matrix effects. In principle, the latter can be compensated for by the application of matrix-matched calibration. The developed method was applied to 18 moldy samples (including bread, fruits, vegetables, jam, cheese, chestnuts and red wine) from private households. This study revealed the great value of the described method: 37 different fungal metabolites were identified at concentrations of up to 33 mg kg(-1), and some of these have never been reported before in the context of moldy food products.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002853', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005658', 'D053719']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Fungi', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",A liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric multi-mycotoxin method for the quantification of 87 analytes and its application to semi-quantitative screening of moldy food samples.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379']","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17874237,2008

This study aimed to determine the MK-9 (4H) concentration in commercial propionibacteria-fermented cheese. The MK-9 (4H) concentration was quantified using an HPLC instrument with a fluorescence detector after postcolumn reduction. Among the various cheese samples, the MK-9 (4H) concentration was highest in Norwegian Jarlsberg cheese, followed by Swiss Emmental cheese. In contrast, the MK-9 (4H) concentrations in Appenzeller or Gruyère cheeses were extremely low or undetected. Likewise, the concentrations in Comte and Raclette cheeses were lower than those in Jarlsberg and Emmental cheeses. In the present study, the MK- 9 (4H) concentration in cheese showed a correlation with the viable propionibacterial cell count and propionate concentration. This implies that the increase in propionibacteria contributed to the generation of MK-9 (4H) in cheese.

17678570,"Soya isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, are the focus of numerous studies investigating their potential effects on health and results remain controversial. Bioavailability is clearly a crucial factor influencing their bioefficacy and could explain these discrepancies. This study aimed at assessing: (1) the isoflavone content of sixty-nine European soya-derivative products sold on the French market; (2) the bioavailability of isoflavones comparing supplement with food. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited in a randomized two-way crossover trial and received 35 mg isoflavones equivalent aglycone either through supplements or through cheese, both containing different patterns of isoflavone conjugates and different daidzein:genistein ratios. A specific ELISA method was used to assess the plasma and urinary concentrations of isoflavones and thus the pharmacokinetic parameters, which were then normalized to mg of each isoflavone ingested. Results showed that the normalized Cmax of daidzein (P = 0.002) and similarly the normalized AUC0 --> infinity and Cmax of genistein (P = 0.002) from soya-based capsules were higher than that from soya-based cheese. In conclusion, this work completes studies on isoflavone bioavailability and presents new data regarding isoflavone concentrations in soya-derivative products. Assuming that isoflavone conjugation patterns do not influence isoflavone bioavailability, this study shows that isoflavones contained in capsules are more bioavailable than those contained in soya-based cheese.

The objective of this research was to develop a simple and rapid screening tool for monitoring the short-chain FFA contents in Swiss cheese by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Forty-four Swiss cheese samples were evaluated by using a MIRacle three-reflection diamond attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. Two different sampling techniques were used for FTIR/ATR measurement: direct measurement of Swiss cheese slices (approximately 0.5 g) and measurement of a water-soluble fraction of cheese. The amounts of FFA (propionic, acetic, and butyric acids) in the water-soluble fraction of samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ion-ization detection as a reference method. Calibration models for both direct measurement and the water-soluble fraction of cheese were developed based on a cross-validated (leave-one-out approach) partial least squares regression by using the regions of 3,000 to 2,800, 1,775 to 1,680, and 1,500 to 900 cm(-1) for short-chain FFA in cheese. Promising performance statistics were obtained for the calibration models of both direct measurement and the water-soluble fraction, with improved performance statistics obtained from the water-soluble extract, particularly for propionic acid. Partial least squares models generated from FTIR/ATR spectra by direct measurement of cheeses gave standard errors of cross-validation of 9.7 mg/100 g of cheese for propionic acid, 9.3 mg/100 g of cheese for acetic acid, and 5.5 mg/100 g of cheese for butyric acid, and correlation coefficients >0.9. Standard error of cross-validation values for the water-soluble fraction were 4.4 mg/100 g of cheese for propionic acid, 9.2 mg/100 g of cheese for acetic acid, and 5.2 mg/100 g of cheese for butyric acid with correlation coefficients of 0.98, 0.95, and 0.92, respectively.

17582091,"Cheddar cheese is a natural product that has a variable flavor and texture profile. Many companies produce 291-kg blocks of Cheddar cheese, which are subsequently cut and shipped, or stored and subsequently cut. Previous research has shown that compositional differences exist within 291-kg blocks and that these differences may influence flavor and texture development. The objectives of this study were to systematically characterize flavor and texture differences within 291-kg blocks. On 2 different occasions, a 291-kg block was manufactured at each of 4 manufacturing facilities. After 7 d, the 291-kg blocks were sliced into sixteen 18-kg sample portions using a predetermined diagram, and each portion was labeled appropriately (outer corner, inner corner, etc.) and stored at 7 degrees C. Cheese from different locations within the 291-kg blocks was evaluated at 1, 4, 8, and 12 mo. At each time point, two 18-kg portions representing an inside and outside location with the 291-kg block cross-section (from inside to outside) were sampled. The moisture content was lower in the inner than outer locations within the 291-kg blocks. Protein hydrolysis was higher in the inner location and inner locations developed aged Cheddar flavors sulfur, nutty, and brothy more rapidly than the outer locations. However, plant-to-plant differences in aging were often larger than differences caused by block location. These differences were due to differences in cheese manufacturing practices among plants. Dynamic headspace results for flavor volatiles were consistent with descriptive sensory flavor results, documenting differences between inner and outer locations within 291-kg blocks. The inner locations were more fracturable and the outer locations were more cohesive and had more residual in the mouth. Inner locations had greater fracture strain than outer locations.

To guarantee its safety, the occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in artisanal Palmero cheese smoked with 2 types of vegetable matter (almond shells and dry prickly pear) was studied. The determination of PAH includes extraction and clean-up steps, followed by separation, identification, and quantification of PAH by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in selected ion-monitoring mode. The most abundant PAH are those with 2 and 3 aromatic rings. Although the highest total PAH concentrations corresponded to the cheeses smoked with almond shells, the degree of PAH contamination of the cheeses studied was lower than that found in other cheeses smoked in the traditional way. The nature of the vegetable material used for smoking seemed to have an influence on the type of PAH formed, especially on alkylderivatives and some light PAH. However, despite the artisanal, and consequently variable, production process of these cheeses, many similarities have been found among their PAH profiles. In fact, relatively constant relationships are observed between the concentrations of certain pairs of PAH.

Random amplification of polymorphic DNA-PCR analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their origin. As shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the pH 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free AA, the secondary proteolysis of Barricato San Martino and Vento d'Estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. Purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. Vento d'Estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and Casciotta di Urbino was characterized by a very low level of volatile components. Esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. Several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for Vento d'Estate cheese. The lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in Casciotta d'Urbino, in which rennet paste was not used during manufacture.

A semi-quantitative questionnaire was used to estimate the frequency of consumption of foods by two age groups of women, pre-menopausal (Pre-M) and post-menopausal (Post-M), and their serum pesticide levels were measured by gas chromatography (GC) with electron capture detector and confirmed by GC and mass spectrometry. The Pre-M group showed significantly higher serum concentrations of all OCs studied with the exception of DDE. The groups significantly differed in consumption of all food groups with the exception of fruit. In the Pre-M group, the mean serum p,p-DDT concentration was significantly associated with milk/yoghurt (p<0.045) and red meat (p<0.023), serum o,p-DDT with red meat (p<0.049), serum aldrin with eggs (p<0.038) and poultry (p<0.024), and serum DDE with eggs (p<0.025).

Seventeen cheese-making experiments (batches) were carried out on an industrial scale on successive days, following the standard procedure with some modifications. Fat content of cheese milk, temperature at the stretching step, and time of brining varied from one batch to another as required by the experimental design, outlined by a surface response model. Proteolysis was assessed during ripening of samples, which was prolonged for at least 3 mo, by means of electrophoresis, nitrogen fractions, and soluble peptide mapping. The amount of soluble nitrogen at pH 4.6 was not significantly different in cheeses obtained by diverse procedures, but it increased during ripening of all samples. This result was coincident with the breakdown of alpha(s1)- and beta-caseins evidenced by electrophoresis, which reached similar extents at late stages of ripening, regardless of the cheese-making process. Multivariate analysis on soluble peptide profiles obtained by liquid chromatography also detected sample grouping according to ripening time, but did not evidence any separation caused by the cheese-making technology.

A good way to raise the CLA content in the diet without a radical change in eating habits seems to be the enrichment of commonly consumed food products with CLA supplements. This study analyzed the total fatty acid content and the CLA isomer composition of 6 commercially available CLA-fortified dairy products during processing and 10 wk of refrigerated storage. Research was carried out by combining gas chromatography and silver-ion HPLC. The tested samples were a CLA oil supplement, and several skim milk dairy products fortified with the supplement (milk, milk powder, fermented milk, yogurt, fresh cheese, and milk-juice blend).

However, there were no differences in VSC production between the wild type and the CBL-null mutant. With cystathionine, methanethiol production was detected from the CBL overexpression variant and complementation of the CBL-null mutant, implying that CBL may be involved in the conversion of cystathionine to methanethiol.

These amines are commonly found in many foodstuffs, particularly in fermented products such as cheese, meat products, beer, wine, and ciders. Here, the level of biogenic amines in some natural ciders was examined. Twenty-four samples of cider purchased from commercial sources were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection after precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde. Amine levels were variable, ranging from not detected to 23 mg/liter. The average level of total biogenic amines in ciders was 5.94 +/- 8.42 mg/liter. Putrescine, histamine, and tyramine were the prevailing amines being present in 50.0, 37.5, and 33.3% of the ciders studied; very small amounts of ethylamine and phenylethylamine were observed in only one sample. Other cider parameters were analyzed to determine whether they affect the biogenic amine content in ciders, and the results were evaluated by applying cluster analysis and principal component analysis. Ciders that showed lower glycerol contents and higher amounts of 1,3-propanediol had much higher levels of histamine, tyramine, and putrescine, suggesting a high activity of lactic acid bacteria during cider making and thus the need for effective control of lactic acid bacteria.",Journal of food protection,"['D001628', 'D001679', 'D002851', 'D016000', 'D003257', 'D005285', 'D005504', 'D005516', 'D006801', 'D027845', 'D025341', 'D013050', 'D009764']","['Beverages', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Fermentation', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Microbiology', 'Humans', 'Malus', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'o-Phthalaldehyde']",Biogenic amines in natural ciders.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17186671,2007
17071508,"Ion mobility spectrometry is known to be a fast and sensitive technique for the detection of trace substances, and it is increasingly in demand not only for protection against explosives and chemical warfare agents, but also for new applications in medical diagnosis or process control. Generally, a gas phase sample is ionized by help of ultraviolet light, ss-radiation or partial discharges. The ions move in a weak electrical field towards a detector. During their drift they collide with a drift gas flowing in the opposite direction and, therefore, are slowed down depending on their size, shape and charge. As a result, different ions reach the detector at different drift times, which are characteristic for the ions considered. The number of ions reaching the detector are a measure of the concentration of the analyte. The method enables the identification and quantification of analytes with high sensitivity (ng l(-1) range). The selectivity can even be increased - as necessary for the analyses of complex mixtures - using pre-separation techniques such as gas chromatography or multi-capillary columns. No pre-concentration of the sample is necessary. Those characteristics of the method are preserved even in air with up to a 100% relative humidity rate. The suitability of the method for application in the field of food quality and safety - including storage, process and quality control as well as the characterization of food stuffs - was investigated in recent years for a number of representative examples, which are summarized in the following, including new studies as well: (1) the detection of metabolites from bacteria for the identification and control of their growth; (2) process control in food production - beer fermentation being an example; (3) the detection of the metabolites of mould for process control during cheese production, for quality control of raw materials or for the control of storage conditions; (4) the quality control of packaging materials during the production of polymeric materials; and (5) the characterization of products - wine being an example. The challenges of such applications were operation in humid air, fast on-line analyses of complex mixtures, high sensitivity - detection limits have to be, for example, in the range of the odour limits - and, in some cases, the necessity of mobile instrumentation. It can be shown that ion mobility spectrometry is optimally capable of fulfilling those challenges for many applications.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D002611', 'D005504', 'D008401', 'D005740', 'D007477', 'D013056']","['Cheese', 'Food Analysis', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gases', 'Ions', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",Ion mobility spectrometry for food quality and safety.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17071508,2007

Maturation of the produced cheese at 4 degrees C was monitored for up to 70 days, and the effects of the starter culture, the salting method, and the ripening process on quality characteristics were studied. The use of kefir coculture as a starter led to increased lactic acid concentrations and decreased pH values in the final product associated with significantly higher conversion rates compared to salted rennet cheese. Determination of bacterial diversity at the end of the ripening process in salted kefir and rennet cheeses by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technology, based on both DNA and RNA analyses, suggested a potential species-specific inhibition of members of the genera Staphylococcus and Psychrobacter by kefir coculture. The main active microbial associations in salted kefir cheese appeared to be members of the genera Pseudomonas and Lactococcus, while in salted rennet cheese, Oxalobacteraceae, Janthinobacterium, Psychrobacter, and Pseudomonas species were noted. The effect of the starter culture on the production of aroma-related compounds responsible for cheese flavor was also studied by the solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique.

Experimental evidence of the involvement of the two 2[5H]-furanones, detected by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/solid-phase microextraction technique, in the autolysis phenomenon has been obtained. Zymograms performed by using renaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels were used to detect the bioactivity of the supernatants containing the two furanones on fresh cells of the same strain. In addition to bands corresponding to known autolysins, new autolysins were detected concomitant with the exposure of Lactobacillus helveticus to the supernatants, which can be regarded as conditioned media (CM), and to a commercial furanone, 5-ethyl-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2[5H]-furanone (HEMFi), having spectral data similar to those of the newly described 2[5H]-furanones.

Therefore, a multi-element isotope ratio analysis is the most efficient means for the origin and authenticity assignment of food, and also for the solution of various problems in ecology, archaeology and criminology. Due to the extraordinary relative abundances of the elements hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in some biological material and to the need for individual sample preparations for H and S, their isotope ratio determination currently requires at least three independent procedures and approximately 1 h of work. We present here a system for the integrated elemental and isotope ratio analysis of all four elements in one sample within 20 min. The system consists of an elemental analyser coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer with an inlet system for four reference gases (N(2), CO(2), H(2) and SO(2)). The combustion gases are separated by reversible adsorption and determined by a thermoconductivity detector; H(2)O is reduced to H(2). The analyser is able to combust samples with up to 100 mg of organic material, sufficient to analyse samples with even unusual elemental ratios, in one run. A comparison of the isotope ratios of samples of water, fruit juices, cheese and ethanol from wine, analysed by the four-element analyser and by classical methods and systems, respectively, yielded excellent agreements.

16772555,"Terrincho cheese is an uncooked, pressed cheese made from raw whole ovine milk from the ""Churra da Terra Quente"" breed. It requires a minimum ripening time of 30 d. A detailed evaluation of the effect of ripening time on the breakdown of the casein fractions, along with the formation of major breakdown products of casein hydrolysis, was monitored by HPLC to contribute to a more complete characterization of this product. In 30-d-old cheeses, only 20% of alpha(S1)-casein remained intact; the beta-casein fraction was more resistant to hydrolysis. The ripening time of Terrincho cheese can be predicted using 2 variables of normalized peak areas of alpha(S1)-casein and alpha(S1)-I peptide, and a constant; the estimation error is 2.5 d. The pH 4.3-insoluble fraction of Terrincho and cheeses manufactured with bovine milk and with ovine milk combined with 2 levels of bovine milk (10 and 20%) revealed different chromatographic and electrophoretic profiles, especially the alpha(S1)-casein fraction. Similar proteolysis progress was observed, particularly in the percentage of casein fraction degradation. However, using both analytical methods, the detection of 10% bovine milk at 30 d of ripening was no longer possible as result of alpha(S1)-casein hydrolysis. The discriminate analysis applied to HPLC data indicated that at 30 d of ripening, differences between the casein fractions of Terrincho cheese and mixture cheeses were mainly from beta1-casein content. The function thus obtained was able to correctly classify all the samples according to cheese type. Using the descriptive sensory profile, Terrincho cheese at 30 d of ripening could be distinguished from bovine and mixture cheeses owing to its higher fracturability and adhesiveness and lower elasticity and hardness, which correlated with its lower total casein content.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002364', 'D002417', 'D002611', 'D002851', 'D004591', 'D005260', 'D005511', 'D006801', 'D006863', 'D006868', 'D008297', 'D009812', 'D012044', 'D012677', 'D012756', 'D012903', 'D013649', 'D013997', 'D014508']","['Animals', 'Caseins', 'Cattle', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Food Handling', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis', 'Male', 'Odorants', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sensation', 'Sheep', 'Smell', 'Taste', 'Time Factors', 'Urea']",Casein breakdown in terrincho ovine cheese: comparison with bovine cheese and with bovine/ovine cheeses.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16772555,2006

16637674,"Ethyl esters (FAEE) and trideuterium-labeled methyl esters (d3-FAME) of fatty acids were prepared and investigated regarding their suitability as internal standards (IS) for the determination of fatty acids as methyl esters (FAME). On CP-Sil 88, ethyl esters of odd-numbered fatty acids eluted approximately 0.5 min after the respective FAME, and only coelutions with minor FAME were observed. Depending on the problem, one or even many FAEE can be added as IS for the quantification of FAME by both GC-FID and GC-MS. By contrast, d3-FAME coeluted with FAME on the polar GC column, and the use of the former as IS requires application of GC-MS. In the SIM mode, m/z 77 and 90 are suggested for d3-methyl esters of saturated fatty acids, whereas m/z 88 and 101 are recommended for ethyl esters of saturated fatty acids. These m/z values give either no or very low response for FAME and can thus be used for the analysis of FAME in food by GC-MS in the SIM mode. Fatty acids in sunflower oil and mozzarella cheese were quantified using five saturated FAEE as IS. Gravimetric studies showed that the transesterification procedure could be carried out without of loss of fatty acids. GC-EI/MS full scan analysis was suitable for the quantitative determination of all unsaturated fatty acids in both food samples, whereas GC-EI/MS in the SIM mode was particularly valuable for quantifying minor fatty acids. The novel GC-EI/MS/SIM method using fatty acid ethyl esters as internal standards can be used to quantify individual fatty acids only, that is, without determination of all fatty acids (the common 100% method), although this is present.

16504327,"Amino acid catabolism is mainly initiated in Lactococcus lactis by a transamination reaction that leads to the formation of alpha-keto acids. In addition, a novel alpha-keto acid decarboxylase enzyme, rare in lactic acid bacteria, responsible for the conversion of alpha-keto acids into aldehydes has been reported in L. lactis IFPL730. The effect of lacticin 3147-induced cell damage on both amino acid transamination and alpha-keto acid decarboxylation by L. lactis IFPL730 leading to the formation of aldehydes from amino acids was investigated. Cell membrane permeabilization induced by lacticin 3147 facilitated the diffusion of amino acids into the cells and thus, enhanced amino acid transamination and formation of alpha-keto acids. However, alpha-keto acid decarboxylation was not affected by cell membrane permeabilization since decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids in both control and lacticin 3147-treated cells were similar, suggesting that these substrates could freely diffuse inside the cells.

Cheeses were produced in three cheese-making trials using raw milk that was artificially contaminated with AFM(1) at the levels of 50, 250 and 750 ng/l and allowed to ripen for three months. AFM(1) determinations were carried out at intervals by LC with fluorescence detection after immunoaffinity column clean-up. During the syneresis of the cheese a proportionately high concentration of AFM(1) remained in curd and for each trial the level was 3.6, 3.8 and 4.0 times higher than levels in milk. At the end of the ripening, the distribution of AFM(1) for cheese/whey + brine samples was 0.9, 1.0 and 1.3 for first, second and third spiking respectively indicating that nearly half of the AFM(1) remained in cheese. It has been found that only 2-4% of the initial spiking of AFM(1) transferred into the brine solution.

The objectives of this study were to characterize the flavors found in full-fat cheese, cheese fat, and reduced-fat cheese made from aged Cheddar using a novel process to remove the fat (Nelson and Barbano, 2004). Two full-fat, aged cheeses (9 and 39 mo) were selected, and the fat was removed using the novel fat removal process. Full-fat cheeses, shredded and reformed full-fat cheeses, corresponding reduced-fat cheeses, and cheese fats were then analyzed using descriptive sensory and instrumental analysis followed by consumer acceptance testing. Cheeses were extracted with diethyl ether followed by isolation of volatile material by high vacuum distillation. Volatile extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography/ olfactometry with aroma extract dilution analysis. Selected compounds were quantified. The 39-mo cheese was characterized by fruity and sulfur notes, and the 9-mo-old cheese was characterized by a spicy/brothy flavor. Reduced-fat cheeses had similar flavor profiles with no difference in most sensory attributes to corresponding full-fat cheeses. Sensory profiles of the cheese fats were characterized by low intensities of the prominent flavors found in the full-fat cheeses. Instrumental analysis revealed similar trends. Consistent with sensory analysis, there were lower concentrations and log(3) flavor dilution factors for most compounds in the cheese fats compared with both the reduced- and full-fat cheeses, regardless of compound polarity. Consumers found the intensity of flavor in the reduced-fat cheese to be equal to the full-fat cheeses.

16428613,"Cheddar cheese ripening involves the conversion of lactose to glucose and galactose or galactose-6-phosphate by starter and nonstarter lactic acid bacteria. Under ideal conditions (i.e., where bacteria grow under no stress of pH, water activity, and salt), these sugars are mainly converted to lactic acid. However, during ripening of cheese, survival and growth of bacteria occurs under the stressed condition of low pH, low water activity, and high salt content. This forces bacteria to use alternate biochemical pathways resulting in production of other organic acids. The objective of this study was to determine if the level and type of organic acids produced during ripening was influenced by calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P), residual lactose, and salt-to-moisture ratio (S/M) of cheese. Eight cheeses with 2 levels of Ca and P (0.67 and 0.47% vs. 0.53 and 0.39%, respectively), lactose at pressing (2.4 vs. 0.78%), and S/M (6.4 vs. 4.8%) were manufactured. The cheeses were analyzed for organic acids (citric, orotic, pyruvic, lactic, formic, uric, acetic, propanoic, and butyric acids) and residual sugars (lactose, galactose) during 48 wk of ripening using an HPLC-based method. Different factors influenced changes in concentration of residual sugars and organic acids during ripening and are discussed in detail. Our results indicated that the largest decrease in lactose and the largest increase in lactic acid occurred between salting and d 1 of ripening. It was interesting to observe that although the lactose content in cheese was influenced by several factors (Ca and P, residual lactose, and S/M), the concentration of lactic acid was influenced only by S/M. More lactic acid was produced in low S/M treatments compared with high S/M treatments. Although surprising for Cheddar cheese, a substantial amount (0.2 to 0.4%) of galactose was observed throughout ripening in all treatments. Minor changes in the levels of citric, uric, butyric, and propanoic acids were observed during early ripening, whereas during later ripening, a substantial increase was observed. A gradual decrease in orotic acid and a gradual increase in pyruvic acid content of the cheeses were observed during 12 mo of ripening. In contrast, acetic acid did not show a particular trend, indicating its role as an intermediate in a biochemical pathway, rather than a final product.",Journal of dairy science,"['D019342', 'D020148', 'D002118', 'D002241', 'D002264', 'D002611', 'D002851', 'D019343', 'D005285', 'D005511', 'D005561', 'D005690', 'D017045', 'D007785', 'D009963', 'D010758', 'D019289', 'D011786', 'D012965', 'D012995', 'D013997', 'D014527', 'D014867']","['Acetic Acid', 'Butyric Acid', 'Calcium', 'Carbohydrates', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Citric Acid', 'Fermentation', 'Food Handling', 'Formates', 'Galactose', 'Lactococcus', 'Lactose', 'Orotic Acid', 'Phosphorus', 'Pyruvic Acid', 'Quality Control', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Solubility', 'Time Factors', 'Uric Acid', 'Water']","Influence of calcium and phosphorus, lactose, and salt-to-moisture ratio on Cheddar cheese quality: changes in residual sugars and water-soluble organic acids during ripening.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428613,2006

In particular, the chromatographic fractions collected during a preliminary fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) separation on the cheese extracts were assayed for antimicrobial activity towards Lactobacillus sakei A15. Active fractions were subsequently analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization sequential mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI)-ITMSn, with n up to 3. Peptide identification was then performed starting from a conventional proteomics approach based on tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis followed by database searching. In many cases this strategy had to be integrated by a careful correlation between spectral information and predicted peptide fragmentation, in order to reach unambiguous identifications. When even this integrated approach failed, MS3 measurements provided decisive information on the amino acid sequence of some peptides, through fragmentation of pendant groups along the peptide chain. As a result, 45 peptides, all arising from hydrolysis of milk caseins, were identified in nine antimicrobial FPLC fractions of aqueous extracts obtained from five of the nine cheese varieties considered.

16357266,"The aim of this study was to provide the biochemical and structural characterization of Piacentinu Ennese cheese and to evaluate the impact of different farm technologies on cheese proteolysis and microstructure. Fifteen cheeses were manufactured according to traditional technology, i.e., from raw milk and farmhouse rennet in the absence of starter culture. Pasteurized milk, commercial rennet, and starter were used for production of 20 nontraditional cheeses. Proteolysis in Piacentinu Ennese cheese was monitored during a 2- to 10-mo ripening time. Low rates of overall proteolysis were observed in cheese, as percentages of total N soluble at pH 4.6 and in 12% trichloroacetic acid were about 11.40 and 8.10%, respectively, after 10 mo of age. Patterns of primary proteolysis by urea-PAGE showed that alpha(s)-caseins were degraded to a larger extent than were beta-caseins, although a considerable amount of both caseins was still intact after 10 mo. Reversed phase-HPLC analysis of the cheese peptide fractions showed a slow decrease in the levels of hydrophobic peptides coupled to increasing levels of hydrophilic compounds as the cheese aged. The structural characteristics of Piacentinu Ennese cheese were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy after 2, 4, and 6 mo of age. The micrographs showed a sponge-like structural network with a well-distributed system of empty spaces, originally occupied by whey and fat. The microstructure changed during cheese ripening to become more compact with cavities of smaller size. Farm technology significantly affected cheese proteolysis and microstructure. Nontraditional cheeses had higher levels of pH 4.6-soluble N and showed a larger hydrolysis of alpha(s)-casein fractions by urea-PAGE analysis than did traditional cheeses. Large differences between cheese-types also concerned the patterns of secondary proteolysis. Nontraditional cheeses had higher levels of 12% trichloroacetic acid-soluble N and showed larger proportions of free amino acids and hydrophilic peptides in the HPLC profiles of the corresponding 70% ethanol-soluble N fraction than traditional cheeses. Nontraditional cheeses also had a more open structure with a coarser and less continuous appearance than did traditional cheeses.

Commercial Cheddar starter was used in making full-fat cheese. Results showed that the actual yield of cheese made with JFR1 was higher than that of all other reduced-fat cheeses. Cheese made with JFR1 contained higher moisture, moisture in the nonfat substance, and residual coagulant activity than all other reduced-fat cheeses. Proteolysis, as determined by PAGE and the level of water-soluble nitrogen, was also higher in cheese made with JFR1 than in all other cheeses. The HPLC analysis showed a significant increase in hydrophobic peptides (causing bitterness) during storage of cheese made with JFR1. Cheese made with the capsule-forming nonropy adjunct of S. thermophilus, which contained lower moisture and moisture in the nonfat substance levels and lower chymosin activity than did cheese made with JFR1, accumulated less hydrophobic peptides. In conclusion, some EPS-producing cultures produced reduced-fat Cheddar cheese with moisture in the nonfat substance similar to that in its full-fat counterpart without the need for modifying the standard cheese-making protocol.

The bacteriocin shows a narrow antimicrobial activity against closely related lactic acid bacteria. Lactococcin MMT24 is heat resistant, remains active after incubation at pH 3 to 10, lyophilization, long-term storage at -20 degrees C and is sensitive to treatment with proteolytic enzymes. The mode of action of lactococcin MMT24 was identified as bactericidal. Purification of the active compound showed that lactococcin MMT24 consists of two distinct peptides, named pepalpha and pepbeta, whose complementary action is necessary for full antibacterial activity. Optimal antibacterial activity was obtained when the complementary peptides pepalpha and pepbetawere present in equal amounts.

In the present study, the interactions of vitamin D3 with beta-lactoglobulin A and beta-casein were investigated under various environmental conditions (i.e., pH and ionic strength) using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopic techniques. The results indicated that vitamin D3 was bound to both beta-lactoglobulin A and beta-casein depending on the solution conditions. The apparent dissociation constants ranged from 0.02 to 0.29 microM for beta-lactoglobulin A, whereas the beta-casein apparent dissociation constants ranged from 0.06 to 0.26 microM. The apparent mole ratios were also comparable, i.e., 0.51-2.04 and 1.16-2.05 mol of vitamin D3 were bound per mole of beta-lactoglobulin A and beta-casein, respectively.

16162519,"Turkish White-brined cheese was manufactured using Lactococcus strains (Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis NCDO763 plus L. lactis ssp. cremoris SK11 and L. lactis ssp. lactis UC317 plus L. lactis ssp. cremoris HP) or without a starter culture, and ripened for 90 d. It was found that the use of starters significantly influenced the physical, chemical, biochemical, and sensory properties of the cheeses. Chemical composition, pH, and sensory properties of cheeses made with starter were not affected by the different starter bacteria. The levels of soluble nitrogen fractions and urea-PAGE of the pH 4.6-insoluble fractions were found to be significantly different at various stages of ripening. Urea-PAGE patterns of the pH 4.6-insoluble fractions of the cheeses showed that considerable degradation of alpha(s1)-casein occurred and that beta-casein was more resistant to hydrolysis. The use of a starter culture significantly influenced the levels of 12% trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen, 5% phosphotungstic acid-soluble nitrogen, free amino acids, total free fatty acids, and the peptide profiles (reverse phase-HPLC) of 70% (vol/vol) ethanol-soluble and insoluble fractions of the pH 4.6-soluble fraction of the cheeses. The levels of peptides in the cheeses increased during the ripening period. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses of electrophoretic and chromatographic results indicated that the cheeses were significantly different in terms of their peptide profiles and they were grouped based on the use and type of starter and stage of ripening. Levels of free amino acid in the cheeses differed; Leu, Glu, Phe, Lys, and Val were the most abundant amino acids. Nitrogen fractions, total free amino acids, total free fatty acids, and the levels of peptides resolved by reverse phase-HPLC increased during ripening. No significant differences were found between the sensory properties of cheeses made using a starter, but the cheese made without starter received lower scores than the cheeses made using a starter. It was found that the cheese made with strains NCDO763 plus SK11 had the best quality during ripening.

Its applications concern from cheese ripening to the preparation of fermented milk products with biologically active peptides. The cell-free extract (CFE) of Lactobacillus helveticus strain ITG LH1 was analysed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), using IPG immobiline dry strips (pH 4-7). With the aim to study the proteolytic enzymes expressed by Lactobacillus helveticus ITG LH1 grown in milk medium, a two step-chromatography methodology, based on ion exchange and affinity chromatography, was developed for the preparation of a peptidase-rich sub-proteome from the CFE of stationary growing cells. Several affinity chromatography columns were tested and among them a HiTrap Chelating column was selected as it provided the best performance for the enrichment in peptidases. Peptidase activities were studied using different beta-Naphtylamide (beta-NA) derivatives and specific activities were increased 50- to 100-fold by this chromatographic procedure. Sub-proteome characterisation was performed by 2D-PAGE, pH 4-7, followed by protein digestion with trypsin, analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and subsequent database searches using peptide mass fingerprints. Among the most abundant proteins seven peptidases were present, namely the two general aminopeptidases (PepN, PepC), three dipeptidases (PepDA, PepV, PepQ) and two endopeptidases (PepO, PepO3), all of them corresponding to the catalytic classes of metallo- or cysteine-peptidases.

As shown by the broth microdilution technique, most of the water-soluble fractions had a large spectrum of inhibition (minimal inhibitory concentration of 20 to 200 microg/mL) toward gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species, including potentially pathogenic bacteria of clinical interest.

The attributes evaluated were characteristic odour and odour intensity and characteristic aroma and aroma intensity. Pasteurization of the milk had an effect on the formation of certain volatile compounds, adversely affecting the characteristic flavour of the cheese. Use of the adjunct culture in addition to the commercial starter improved the flavour of the cheese made from the pasteurized milk, which earned sensory scores similar to those awarded to the cheese made from the raw milk.

However, available food sources of lutein contain only modest amounts of the carotenoid. Food fortification with lutein extract has been identified as a low-budget approach to prevent the onset or progression of AMD. The objectives of this study were to 1) incorporate various amounts of lutein into Cheddar cheese; 2) examine the color, pH, microbiological, and sensory characteristics of the Cheddar cheese during storage; and 3) analyze the stability of lutein during the cheese maturation process. Lutein extracted from corn was added to Cheddar cheese in quantities of 1, 3, and 6 mg per serving size. Measurements of the lutein stability were carried out by HPLC using a YMC C30 carotenoid column. Microbiological analyses of cheese samples included aerobic plate count, coliform, and yeast/mold counts. The color attributes a* and b* were significantly different between the treatment and control groups; however, no significant difference was observed in L* value and pH. Significant differences among 1, 3, and 6 mg lutein-enriched cheeses were observed in the aerobic plate count and yeast/mold compared with the control. Cheese samples contained no detectable levels of coliforms (< 10 cfu/g).

15778296,"The appearance of undesirable bitter taste in Ragusano cheese was investigated by comparing the composition of 9 bitter cheeses with that of 9 reference cheeses of good quality by means of chemical, electrophoretic, and chromatographic analyses. Rates of proteolysis were significantly affected in cheeses of different quality. Primary proteolysis, as measured by pH 4.6-soluble N, was significantly greater in bitter cheeses compared with reference samples. Urea-PAGE profiles showed an almost complete breakdown of caseins in bitter cheeses and the further degradation of primary peptides into smaller compounds not detectable by this technique. Cheeses with defects had significantly lower levels of secondary proteolysis as reflected by the percentage of pH 4.6-soluble N soluble in 12% trichloroacetic acid and the amounts of total free amino acids. Peptides separated by reversed phase-HPLC revealed that the large and significant differences in peptide profiles of the soluble fractions between bitter and reference cheeses were mainly due to a much higher proportion of hydrophobic peptides in the former. The occurrence of bitterness in Ragusano cheese was therefore attributable to unbalanced levels of proteolysis and peptidolysis. Extensive degradation of caseins and primary peptides by activities of proteases produced large amounts of small- and medium-sized hydrophobic peptides that were not adequately removed by peptidases of microflora and therefore accumulated in cheese potentially contributing to its bitter taste. The presence of these compounds in bitter cheeses was related to high salt-in-moisture and low moisture contents that limited the enzymatic activities of microflora important in secondary proteolysis. Combining salt-in-moisture and the ratio of hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic soluble peptides resulted in the best logistic partial least squares regression model predicting cheese quality. Although bitterness is known to be rarely encountered in cheese at salt-in-moisture levels >5.0, all of the bitter cheeses analyzed in this study had salt-in-moisture levels much greater than this value. According to the logistic model, a risk of bitterness development may exist for cheeses with a midrange (5 to 10%) salt-in-moisture content but with an inadequate level of secondary proteolysis.",Journal of dairy science,"['D002364', 'D002611', 'D002851', 'D004591', 'D005524', 'D006863', 'D008894', 'D010455', 'D011786', 'D013649', 'D013997', 'D014508']","['Caseins', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Food Technology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Milk Proteins', 'Peptides', 'Quality Control', 'Taste', 'Time Factors', 'Urea']",Evaluation of bitterness in Ragusano cheese.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15778296,2005

Multidimensional techniques, such as heart-cut multi-dimensional gas chromatography (heart-cut MDGC) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC), were investigated for their ability to solve coelution problems with other PCBs present in commercial mixtures and real-life samples. Heart-cut MDGC improved the separation as compared to one-dimensional GC, and enantiomeric fractions of the investigated chiral PCBs could be determined free from interferences. However, limitations on the number of target compounds that can be transferred to the second column in a single run and, therefore, the time consumption, have led to the evaluation of GC x GC as an alternative for this type of analysis. With GC x GC, two column set-ups were tested, both having a chiral column as first-dimension column, and two different polar stationary phase columns in the second dimension.

Additionally, fluorescence spectra of tryptophan (excitation: 290 nm; emission: 305 to 400 nm) were collected on each sample at 20 degrees C using a front-face accessory. Fluorescence spectrum for each sample consisted of an average of 36 scans (6 scans performed on 6 replicates). The spectral data set consisted of normalized and mean-centered spectra from all the samples. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to correlate spectral data with cheese meltability index as measured by dynamic stress rheometry. A prediction model was developed using partial least square regression and was calibrated using a cross-validation method. A correlation coefficient of 0.93 was obtained between fluorescence spectra and cheese meltability. The regions 335 to 350 nm and 385 to 400 nm had the highest correlation to cheese meltability. A negative correlation between the peak height of tryptophan (335 to 350 nm) and cheese meltability index was observed. This correlation may be due to presence of tryptophan residues in a more hydrophobic environment in stronger emulsions as compared with a more polar environment in weak emulsions.

Precision of exact mass measurements was calculated taking into account the ion statistics according to the number of ion sampled in the measurement. Accurate mass measurements by MS/MS experiments were performed to elucidate azo-dye fragmentation patterns. Selectivity of the microLC-Q-TOF MS method was assessed by evaluating matrix suppression effects by pre-column injection of blank hot chilli tomato sauce matrices. The results were compared with those obtained on a LC-triple quadrupole-MS system. Confirmation of Sudan I present in hot chill tomato sauce samples was obtained by accurate mass measurements.

Two types of fiber coatings and different extraction conditions were tested. The results reveal that the use of an 85-microm polyacrylate fiber immersed in the headspace of the samples at 70 degrees C for 60 min is suitable for the detection of PAH with no more than 4 aromatic rings. To determine if a relationship can be established between the results obtained using a solvent extraction technique and HS-SPME, 6 samples of smoked cheese previously studied by a solvent extraction method were analyzed by HS-SPME, and the results obtained by both methodologies were compared. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were identified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry operating in selective ion monitoring mode. Among the PAH determined by the solvent extraction method, only those with 4 aromatic rings or less were detected by HS-SPME and, consequently, this technique does not allow one to determine the PAH content of smoked cheese samples under the conditions of the study.

This research effort focused on a search for the molecules responsible for those organoleptic characteristics. Eighty cheeses manufactured in 4 dairies located in the Appelation d'Origine Protegee region of Serra da Estrela, Portugal, were thus assayed for volatiles, in an attempt to characterize their odorous profile. Cheeses were analyzed from the time of manufacture up to 180 d of ripening. The volatile fraction was assayed by solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, and several compounds belonging to different chemical groups (e.g., fatty acids, esters, carbonyl compounds, pyrazines, and sulfur compounds) were detected in that traditional cheese. Among these, free fatty acids (FFA) were quantitatively the dominant family present. Furthermore, sensory descriptors for the typical aroma of this cheese included acidic, sweaty, and sheepy-like. Acetic, isobutyric, and isovaleric acids increased in concentration during the ripening process up to 90 d, and remained constant thereafter. Preliminary sensory analysis was performed by addition of the major FFA to an unripened cheese matrix; results showed that they could successfully be used as ripening indicators for this cheese.

Adsorbents prepared by attachment of trimethyl amine to particles activated in sequential reactions with allyl bromide and N-bromosuccinimide yielded a maximum bovine serum albumin binding capacity of 156 mg g(-1) combined with a dissociation constant of 0.60 microM, whereas ion-exchangers created by linking polyethylene imine through superficial aldehydes bound up to 337 mg g(-1) with a dissociation constant of 0.042 microM. The latter anion-exchanger was selected for studies of whey protein fractionation. In these, crude bovine whey was treated with a superparamagnetic cation-exchanger to adsorb basic protein species, and the supernatant arising from this treatment was then contacted with the anion-exchanger. For both adsorbent classes of ion-exchanger, desorption selectivity was subsequently studied by sequentially increasing the concentration of NaCl in the elution buffer. In the initial cation-exchange step quantitative removal of lactoferrin (LF) and lactoperoxidase (LPO) was achieved with some simultaneous binding of immunoglobulins (Ig). The immunoglobulins were separated from the other two proteins by desorbing with a low concentration of NaCl (< or = 0.4 M), whereas lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase were co-eluted in significantly purer form, e.g. lactoperoxidase was purified 28-fold over the starting material, when the NaCl concentration was increased to 0.4-1 M.

15377592,"Chemometric modeling of peptide and free amino acid data was used to study proteolysis in Protected Denomination of Origin Ragusano cheese. Twelve cheeses ripened 3 to 7 mo were selected from local farmers and were analyzed in 4 layers: rind, external, middle, and internal. Proteolysis was significantly affected by cheese layer and age. Significant increases in nitrogen soluble in pH 4.6 acetate buffer and 12% trichloroacetic acid were found from rind to core and throughout ripening. Patterns of proteolysis by urea-PAGE showed that rind-to-core and age-related gradients of moisture and salt contents influenced coagulant and plasmin activities, as reflected in varying rates of hydrolysis of the caseins. Analysis of significant intercorrelations among chemical parameters revealed that moisture, more than salt content, had the largest single influence on rates of proteolysis. Lower levels of 70% ethanol-insoluble peptides coupled to higher levels of 70% ethanol-soluble peptides were found by reversed phase-HPLC in the innermost cheese layers and as the cheeses aged. Non-significant increases of individual free amino acids were found with cheese age and layer. Total free amino acids ranged from 14.3 mg/g (6.2% of total protein) at 3 mo to 22.0 mg/g (8.4% of total protein) after 7 mo. Glutamic acid had the largest concentration in all samples at each time and, jointly with lysine and leucine, accounted for 48% of total free amino acids. Principal components analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis of the data from reversed phase-HPLC chromatograms and free amino acids analysis showed that the peptide profiles were more useful in differentiating Ragusano cheese by age and farm origin than the amino acid data. Combining free amino acid and peptide data resulted in the best partial least squares regression model (R(2) = 0.976; Q(2) = 0.952) predicting cheese age, even though the peptide data alone led to a similarly precise prediction (R(2) = 0.961; Q(2) = 0.923). The most important predictors of age were soluble and insoluble peptides with medium hydrophobicity.

Experimental Camembert-type cheeses were prepared in duplicate from pasteurized milk inoculated with Kluyveromyces lactis, Geotrichum candidum, Penicillium camemberti and Brevibacterium linens under aseptic conditions. Two replicates performed under controlled conditions of temperature (12 degrees C), relative humidity (95 +/- 2%), and atmosphere showed similar ripening characteristics. The evolutions of metabolite concentrations were studied during ripening. The volatile components were extracted by dynamic headspace extraction, separated and quantified by gas chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. For each cheese the volatile concentrations varied with the part considered (rind or core). Except for ethyl acetate and 2-pentanone, the volatile quantities observed were higher than their perception thresholds. The flavour component production was best correlated with the starter strains. During the first 10 days the ester formations (ethyl, butyl and isoamyl acetates) were associated with the concentrations of K. lactis and G. candidum. The rind quantity of esters was lower than that observed in core probably due to (1) a diffusion from the core to the surface and (2) evaporation from the surface to the chamber atmosphere. G. candidum and Brev. linens association produced 3 methyl butanol and methyl 3-butanal from leucine, respectively. DMDS came from the methionine catabolism due to Brev. linens. Styrene production was attributed to Pen. camemberti. 2-Pentanone evolution was associated with Pen. camemberti spores and G. candidum. 2-Heptanone changes were not directly related to flora activities while 2-octanone production was essentially due to G. candidum.

In the cheeses experimentally smoked with straw and cardboard the BaP levels, ranging from 0.38 to 2.12 microg kg(-1) and from 0.46 to 2.40 microg kg(-1), respectively, were statistically higher than those of the cheeses smoked with wood shavings and aromatized with liquid smoke (from 0.19 to 0.80 microg kg(-1) and from 0.18 to 0.50 microg kg(-1), respectively). However the cheeses treated with liquid smoke flavor showed a BaP content exceeding the level allowed by the European Union. In the samples sold at retail, smoked with straw, values were lower than those obtained from samples smoked experimentally with the same combustible. This is probably due to different smoking technologies among the several provinces of the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) area.

15202640,"Milk-clotting enzyme is considered largely denatured after the cooking step in hard cheeses. Nevertheless, typical hydrolysis products derived from rennet action on alpha(s1)-casein have been detected during the ripening of hard cheeses. The aim of the present work was to investigate the influence of residual milk-clotting enzyme on alpha(s1)-casein hydrolysis in Reggianito cheeses. For that purpose, we studied the influence of cooking temperature (45, 52, and 60 degrees C) on milk-clotting enzyme residual activity and alpha(s1)-casein hydrolysis during ripening. Milk-clotting enzyme residual activity in cheeses was assessed using a chromatographic method, and the hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-casein was determined by electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography. Milk-clotting enzyme activity was very low or undetectable in 60 degrees C- and 52 degrees C-cooked cheeses at the beginning of the ripening, but it increased afterwards, particularly in 52 degrees C-cooked cheeses. Cheese curds that were cooked at 45 degrees C had higher initial milk clotting activity, but also in this case, there was a later increase. Hydrolysis of alpha(s1)-casein was detected early in cheeses made at 45 degrees C, and later in those made at higher temperatures. The peptide alpha(s1)-I was not detected in 60 degrees C-cooked cheeses. The results suggest that residual milk-clotting enzyme can contribute to proteolysis during ripening of hard cheeses, because it probably renatures partially after the cooking step. Consequently, the production of peptides derived from alpha(s1)-casein in hard cheeses may be at least, partially due to this proteolytic agent.",Journal of dairy science,"['D016282', 'D002364', 'D002611', 'D002851', 'D004591', 'D005524', 'D006358', 'D006868', 'D010446', 'D013997']","['Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases', 'Caseins', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Food Technology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrolysis', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Time Factors']",Influence of residual milk-clotting enzyme on alpha(s1) casein hydrolysis during ripening of Reggianito Argentino cheese.,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None]","['metabolism', 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15202640,2004

15193805,"During the ripening of Emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. In Emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters like Lactobacillus helveticus, Lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as Propionibacterium freudenreichii. The aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a reference map. A methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of cheese matrix prior to 2D-PAGE analysis. The aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. Five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) DNA and RNA repair and (v) oxidoreduction. The results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and Propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. Information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening.

15187301,"The oligopeptide fractions of Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese samples, at various stages of ageing (6, 12, 18 and 24 months), were analysed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The main oligopeptides (< 5000 Da) present in the samples were extracted by using an originally developed method which allowed good enrichment of the oligopeptide fractions and identified according to their molecular weights. The casein sequences compatible with the found molecular weights were determined and the exact oligopeptide sequences were identified by using the fragmentation peaks originated by in-source collisionally-induced dissociation (CID). The ESI-MS method reported here allowed the sequence identification of oligopeptides very quickly with a single liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry run. Oligopeptides were also semi-quantified by comparison with a suitable internal standard (the dipeptide phenylalanyl-phenylalanine, Phe-Phe). This methodology demonstrated that, as far as the main oligopeptides are concerned, Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano presented very similar composition. Anyway, the evolution of the fractions during ageing time was characteristically distinct among the two cheeses: in Grana Padano cheeses most of the oligopeptides reached a maximum at 12 months of ageing and then decreased, whereas in Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses the oligopeptide amounts were usually lower and had a less regular trend. The reason for this different behaviour may be ascribed to the different production techniques.","European journal of mass spectrometry (Chichester, England)","['D002364', 'D002611', 'D002853', 'D005504', 'D008970', 'D009842', 'D012015', 'D021241', 'D013997']","['Caseins', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oligopeptides', 'Reference Standards', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Time Factors']",Study of the oligopeptide fraction in Grana Padano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15187301,2004
15081990,"It has been known for a long time that both the crystal structure and kinetics of crystallisation can be affected by ultrasound. In the past systems used have relied on high power ultrasonic probes to produce crystals. The majority of these probes produce cavitation in the system and it has been difficult to differentiate between effects caused by the ultrasound alone or by the cavitation produced by ultrasound on the crystal structure. Some materials, such as fats, are very susceptible to the production of free radicals that lead to ""off-flavours"" being obtained. These ""off-flavours"" are easily produced when the standard high power probes are used. This has meant that, although the crystal structure of the final product might be improved, the presence of 'off' flavours has prevented ultrasound being considered as a commercial technique for the crystallisation of edible fats. At Unilever R&D a system has been developed which can investigate the effect of ultrasound on the crystallisation of fats under controlled conditions covering a range of intensities and cooling rates. The intensity levels used were both below and above the cavitational threshold. By keeping the cooling regime constant it has been possible to show that the structure of the final product can vary from a material looking similar to cottage cheese through to a fine cream simply by varying the ultrasonic intensity.

15068068,"Effects of including silage in the diet on volatile compound profiles and their modification during ripening of Montasio cheeses were examined. Twelve farms were selected and grouped according the type of forage in the ration: hay-based diets (four farms); hay and corn silage-based diets (four farms); and diets based on hay, corn silage and grass silages (four farms). For cheesemaking, 1000 kg of milk collected from two consecutive milkings was sampled from each farm and processed in the same cheese factory. Cheeses were ripened in the same cellar, in controlled humidity (78-85% relative humidity) and temperature (9-12 degrees C), until analysis. After 68 (62-74), 200 (194-206) and 360 (354-366) d of ripening, a cheese from each batch was analysed for moisture, protein and fat, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and volatile compounds. These latter were analysed by dynamic reverse carrier gas headspace gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique, scanning from m/z 29 to m/z 300 at 0.5 s cycle time. Total and individual VFA contents of cheeses did not differ between the different dietary treatments and increased linearly (P<0.01) during ripening, indicating that there were no appreciable defects of fermentation. Sixty-two volatile compounds were identified in the cheese samples: 12 aldehydes, 9 ketones, 16 alcohols, 17 esters, 2 hydrocarbons, 4 sulphur-containing compounds and 2 terpenes. Diet significantly affected the amount of total alcohols, ethanol, isobutanol, 1-penten-3-ol, 2-methyl-1-butanol and the sum of all the volatile compounds. Significant variations of 33 volatile compounds (9 aldehydes, 4 ketones, 6 alcohols, 10 esters, 1 hydrocarbons, 2 sulphur containing compounds, and 1 terpene) were observed during ripening.

The concentration of the H2B1a component of IVM was analysed in these dairy products using an HPLC method with fluorescence detection. The mean recovery of the method was, depending on the matrix, between 87 and 100%. Limits of detection in the order of only 0.1 microg H2B1a/kg of product were achieved. Maximum concentrations of IVM were detected mostly at 2 d after drug administration to the ewes. The highest concentration of IVM was found on day 2 in 60-day ripened cheese (96 microg H2B1a/kg cheese). Secondary whey was the matrix with the lowest concentration of IVM (<0.6 microg H2B1a/ kg). Residue levels fell below the limits of detection between day 5 (for secondary whey) and day 25 (for all cheese samples). In the matrices investigated, linear correlations between daily concentrations of IVM, milk fat and solid content were evident. During yoghurt production, fermentation and thermal stability of IVM was observed. During cheese production, approximately 35% of the IVM, present in the raw (bulk) milk samples, was lost.

In this study, we compared the chromatographic profiles of GMP isolated by three methods (trichloracetic acid fractionation, ethanol precipitation, and ultrafiltration) from whey protein isolate (WPI). Seven sharp heterogeneous GMP peaks were eluted from GMP prepared by ethanol precipitation and ultrafiltration using Mono Q anionic chromatography, while only 5 peaks were seen in TCA treated sample. The TCA pretreatment recovered only sialo-GMP (glycosylated) and eliminated all contaminated proteins; however, the recovery rate was the lowest (6.7% of the initial WPI). Ethanol precipitation recovered 20.4% of GMP from WPI and 75.7% was glycosylated, but the heating process might lead to degradation of glycosidic residues. Ultrafiltration was found to be the most effective in recovering GMP. The recovery rate was 33.9% with 81.6% sialo-GMP.

Interindividual differences were observed for most of the parameters and for all of the NVC studied. The parameters extracted from the release profiles of the NVC were closely correlated.

14740817,"Reggianito Argentino cheese is traditionally manufactured with whey starter cultures that provide typical and intense flavor but can cause poor quality standardization. In this study, the influence of natural and selected starters on Reggianito Argentino cheese proteolysis was investigated. Cheeses were manufactured with three strains of Lactobacillus helveticus (SF133, SF138 and SF209) cultured individually in sterile whey and used as single or mixed starters. Control cheeses were made with natural whey starter culture. Cheeses were analyzed to determine gross composition, as well as total thermophilic lactic flora. Proteolysis was assessed by N fractions, electrophoresis and liquid chromatography. Gross composition of the cheeses did not significantly differ, while viable starter cell counts were lower for cheeses made with strain SF209 alone or combined with other strains. Soluble N at pH 4.6 was the same for cheeses made with natural or selected starters, but soluble N in 12% trichloroacetic acid and 2.5% phosphotungstic acid was significantly higher in cheeses made with starters containing strain SF209. Nitrogen fractions results indicated that natural whey starter cultures could be replaced by several starters composed of the selected strains without significant changes to proteolysis patterns. Starter cultures prepared only with SF209 or with the three selected L. helveticus strains produced cheese products with significantly more proteolysis than control cheeses. Chromatographic profiles analyzed by principal components showed that three main peaks on chromatograms, presumptively identified as Tyr, Phe, and Trp, explained most of variability. Principal component scores indicated that cheese samples were grouped by ripening time, which was confirmed by linear discriminant analysis.

Traditionally used as Swiss-type cheese starters, propionibacteria also constitute promising human probiotics. Stress tolerance and cross-protection in Propionibacterium freudenreichii were thus examined after exposure to heat, acid, or bile salts stresses. Adapted cells demonstrated acquired homologous tolerance. Cross-protection between bile salts and heat adaptation was demonstrated. By contrast, bile salts pretreatment sensitized cells to acid challenge and vice versa. Surprisingly, heat and acid responses did not present significant cross-protection in P. freudenreichii. During adaptations, important changes in cellular protein synthesis were observed using two-dimensional electrophoresis. While global protein synthesis decreased, several proteins were overexpressed during stress adaptations. Thirty-four proteins were induced by acid pretreatment, 34 by bile salts pretreatment, and 26 by heat pretreatment. Six proteins are common to all stresses and represent general stress-response components. Among these polypeptides, general stress chaperones, and proteins involved in energetic metabolism, oxidative stress response, or SOS response were identified.

The device consists of membrane strips, with antibody-immobilized zones, attached to a polyethylene card. A moist filter paper placed between the membrane and the polyethylene card acts as the absorbent body. The device was used to estimate very low concentrations of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) present in food samples by using an improved catalyzed reporter deposition (Super-CARD) method of signal amplification involving biotinylated tyramine (B-T) and avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. 4-chloro-1-naphthol was used as the substrate for visualization. Semiquantitative results are obtained by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards. Quantitative estimation is possible by densitometric analysis (detection limit 0.25 pg/spot, 0.01 ng mL(-1)). Dilute samples can be assayed by in situ concentration with improved dose-response characteristics. A batch of 12 extracted samples can be analyzed in a single test card within 12 min.

The milk was segregated and categorized into three different SCC groups: < 100,000 (group I); 100,000 to 1,000,000 (group II); and > 1,000,000 cells/ ml (group III). Milk was stored frozen at -19 degrees C for 4 mo. Milk was then thawed at 7 degrees C over a 3-d period before pasteurization and cheese making. Casein (CN) content and CN-to-true protein ratio decreased with increasing SCC group 3.99, 3.97, to 3.72% CN, and 81.43, 79.72, and 79.32% CN to true protein ratio, respectively. Milk fat varied from 5.49, 5.67, and 4.86% in groups I, II, and III, respectively. Hard ewe's milk cheese was made from each of the three different SCC groups using a Manchego cheese manufacturing protocol. As the level of SCC increased, the time required for visual flocculation increased, and it took longer to reach the desired firmness for cutting the coagulum. The fat and moisture contents were lower in the highest SCC cheeses. After 3 mo, total free fatty acids (FFA) contents were significantly higher in the highest SCC cheeses. Butyric and caprylic acids levels were significantly higher in group III cheeses at all stages of ripening. Cheese graders noted rancid or lipase flavor in the highest SCC level cheeses at each of the sampling points, and they also deducted points for more body and textural defects in these cheeses at 6 and 9 mo.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D020148', 'D002210', 'D002364', 'D002452', 'D002611', 'D002849', 'D005230', 'D005511', 'D005615', 'D006801', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D012756', 'D013649']","['Animals', 'Butyric Acid', 'Caprylates', 'Caseins', 'Cell Count', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified', 'Food Handling', 'Freezing', 'Humans', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Sheep', 'Taste']",Hard ewe's milk cheese manufactured from milk of three different groups of somatic cell counts.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14594225,2003

The results obtained indicate that bovine, ovine, and caprine CMPs exhibited moderate in vitro ACE-inhibitory activities that increased considerably after digestion under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Active peptides could also be produced from CMPs via proteolysis with trypsin, with tryptic hydrolysates exhibiting a more extensive ACE-inhibitory activity than intact CMPs during simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Two active fractions were chromatographically separated from the tryptic hydrolysate of the bovine CMP, but their complexity hampered the assignment of the ACE-inhibitory activity to specific peptide sequences. Evidence for the release of the strong ACE-inhibitory tripeptide IPP was found upon simulation of the gastrointestinal digestion of peptides released by trypsin from the CMP sequence.

The iodine concentration of eighty-five samples of milk and dairy products was analysed by inductively coupled plasma-MS. Low-fat milk and organic milk were sampled from nineteen and seven different locations in Norway, respectively, during the summer and winter season of 2000. Other milk and dairy products were chiefly collected during the summer season. Low-fat milk from the summer season had significantly lower median iodine concentration (88 microg/l, range 63-122 microg/l) compared with low-fat milk from the winter season (232 microg/l, range 103-272 microg/l). The median iodine concentration of organic summer milk (60 microg/l) was significantly lower than the iodine concentration of organic winter milk (127 microg/l). There were no significant differences in the low-fat-milk samples with regard to geographical sampling location. Whey cheese (Tine Gudbrandsdalsost) iodine concentration was significantly higher (803 microg/kg) than the median iodine concentration in casein cheeses such as Jarlsberg and Norvegia of 201 and 414 microg/kg, respectively.

Glutamyl dipeptides were separated in a sequence-specific order with peptides with N-terminal glutamic acid residues eluting prior to their reverse sequence analogues. ESI-MSn detection in the positive ionization mode provided the necessary information to unambiguously identify isobaric peptides due to their characteristic fragmentation patterns.

The rate of hydrolysis and the activity against synthetic substrates with N-terminal residues of Arg, Lys, Leu, Glu or Pro, varied markedly among the strains. The X-Pro DAP activity was consistently high. The crude cell-wall and cytoplasm extracts from strain Lb. helveticus ISLC59 were analysed thoroughly for their proteolysis ability by using four synthetic peptide substrates, including alpha(s)1-CN(f1-23). Peptides formed during in vitro hydrolysis of the synthetic substrates by cell wall and cytoplasm preparations were identified by LC-ESI/MS. In doing so, it was possible to infer a prevalent endopeptidase activity splitting Lys7-His8 and Gln13-Glu14 bonds in the cytoplasm, and to deduce a secondary activity, which hydrolysed Glu14-Val15, Leu16-Asn17, Glu18-Asn19 and Lys3-His4 bonds lacking in the cell-wall. The presence of exopeptidases, as mainly AP, DAP, and carboxypeptidase (CPase) was deduced from the formation of several N- and C-terminally truncated peptides sets. The AP activity was higher in the cell-wall layer, where CPase activity was absent. The in vitro assays with cell extracts of the Lb. helveticus ISLC59 strain revealed extensive exopeptidase and endopeptidase activities.

12778571,"Commercial milk protein concentrate (MPC) was used to standardize whole milk for reduced-fat Cheddar cheesemaking. Four replicate cheesemaking trials of three treatments (control, MPC1, and MPC2) were conducted. The control cheese (CC) was made from standardized milk (casein-to-fat ratio, C/F approximately 1.7) obtained by mixing skim milk and whole milk (WM); MPC1 and MPC2 cheeses were made from standardized milk (C/F approximately 1.8) obtained from mixing WM and MPC, except that commercial mesophilic starter was added at the rate of 1% to the CC and MPC1 and 2% to MPC2 vats. The addition of MPC doubled cheese yields and had insignificant effects on fat recoveries (approximately 94% in MPC1 and MPC2 vs. approximately 92% in CC) but increased significantly total solids recoveries (approximately 63% in CC vs. 63% in MPC1 and MPC2). Although minor differences were noted in the gross composition of the cheeses, both MPC1 and MPC2 cheeses had lower lactose contents (0.25 or 0.32%, respectively) than in CC (0.60%) 7 d post manufacture. Cheeses from all three treatments had approximately 10(9) cfu/g initial starter bacteria count. The nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) grew slowly in MPC1 and MPC2 cheeses during ripening compared to CC, and at the end of 6 mo of ripening, numbers of NSLAB in the CC were 1 to 2 log cycles higher than in MPC1 and MPC2 cheeses. Primary proteolysis, as noted by water-soluble N contents, was markedly slower in MPC1 and MPC2 cheeses compared to CC. The concentrations of total free amino acids were in decreasing order CC > MPC2 > MPC1 cheeses, suggesting slower secondary proteolysis in the MPC cheeses than in CC.

The scope of previously reported methods has been broadened to cover a wide range of retail foods and enzymatic hydrolysis has been used in place of saponification for high-fat samples. Quantitative results (greater then 0.1 mg kg(-1)) are given for the major colour principals trans-beta-apo-8'-carotenal and trans-beta-carotene. Semiquantitative results are given for the various cis-isomers of each colorant for which authentic reference standards were not available. The method has been used successfully for the analysis of a wide range of foodstuffs with differing fat content without the need for saponification, except for moderate- to high-fat foodstuffs containing significant levels of emulsifiers, for which it was limited. The results suggest that beta-apo-8'-carotenal (E160e) does not have widespread use in the UK.

Analytical and quantitative spectral properties of fluorescence were elucidated by use of principal component analysis with designed experiments involving different levels of air and light exposure. A significant reduction in fluorescence intensity at approximately 525 nm, and a corresponding increase in the region 415 to 490 nm as a result of illumination was observed on all the products. The effect was ascribed to photodegradation of riboflavin. Variation in two smaller peaks at approximately 620 nm and 630 nm was an interaction effect between exposure to light and air. A pronounced interaction effect between light and air produced intense blue fluorescence and off-flavors on Swiss-like Jarlsberg cheese. High correlations (0.83 to 0.93) between fluorescence spectra and sensory measured off-flavors were obtained for cream cheese. Results indicate that solid-sample fluorescence can be used as a nondestructive and rapid tool to measure the degree of light-induced degradation of riboflavin as well as sensory properties connected to storage of dairy products.

For cheeses with a similar pH, reducing the calcium-to-casein ratio from -29 to 22 mg/g of protein resulted in marked increases in moisture content and in primary and secondary proteolysis, as indicated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and higher levels of pH 4.6- and 5%-PTA-soluble N. Increasing the pH of DA cheeses of similar moisture content, from approximately 5.5 to 5.9, while maintaining the calcium-to-casein ratio almost constant at approximately 29 mg/g, resulted in a decrease in primary proteolysis but had no effect on secondary proteolysis. Comparison of CL and DA cheeses with a similar composition showed that the CL cheese had higher levels of alpha(s1)-CN degradation, pH 4.6- and 5%-PTA-soluble N.

Furthermore, the study evaluated the feasibility of alternative solvents for extracting lipids and subsequent peroxide value determinations. Packaged cheeses were stored under illuminated display at 4 degrees C to obtain samples with various peroxide contents but with uniform gross composition. The hydroperoxide contents were measured during 3 weeks of storage by applying two lipid extraction methods, Folch and Bureau of Dairy Industry (BDI) extractions, and three different hydroperoxide extraction solutions [chloroform/methanol (7:3, v/v), hexane/2-propanol/methanol (5:7:2, v/v/v), and methanol/decanol/hexane (3:2:1, v/v/v)], prior to standard colorimetric measurements. Extraction yields of fat from Havarti cheeses using the Folch and BDI extraction methods were approximately 109 and 61%, respectively, of the yields obtained by the International Dairy Federation gravimetric reference method. Although differences in fat extraction yields were compensated for, significantly higher peroxide values resulted from the Folch extraction method than from the BDI extraction method. The peroxide values obtained by the three methods were all in the same range, and pronounced linear correlations between peroxide contents determined using the three solutions were noted (r (2) in the range of 0.951-0.983).

At the start of storage, liquid coproducts are already in the 'middle' of the fermentation process, while liquid compound diets need approximately 24-36 h before fermentation begins.

First, a specific IAC for staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), IAC-1, was prepared by coupling monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against SEA; second, a polyspecific IAC for SEA, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), staphylococcal enterotoxin C (SECs), and staphylococcal enterotoxin D (SED), IAC-2, was prepared by coupling a mixture of mAbs against SEA, SECs, and SED, and rabbit IgG against SEB. These columns were applied for detection of SETs in dairy products, after extraction, immunoaffinity chromatography, and enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA). Overall recoveries from dairy products spiked with 1 ng SEA/25 g averaged 81.2% (range, 76-85%) on IAC-1. The repeated use of IAC-1 was then determined with good efficiency of 91.5%, in more than 10 runs. On the other hand, a recovery yield of 77% of SETs (SEA, SEB, SEC, and SED) from dairy products spiked with 2.5 ng of each enterotoxin per 25 g, was obtained with IAC-2.

As classic analytical methods for dietary fiber measurement are not effective, several specific methods have been proposed. These methods measure total fructans and are based on one or more enzymatic sample treatments and determination of released sugars. To determine inulin for labeling purposes, we developed an easy and rapid anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method following water extraction of inulin. HPLC conditions included an Aminex HPX- 87C column (Bio-Rad), deionized water at 85 degrees C as the mobile phase and a refractive index detector. The tested foods included tailor-made food products containing known amounts of inulin and commercial products (cookies, milk, ice creams, cheese, and cereal bars). The average recovery was 97%, and the coefficient of variation ranged from 1.1 to 5% in the food matrixes. The obtained results showed that this method provides an easier, faster and cheaper alternative than previous techniques for determining inulin with enough accuracy and precision for routine labeling purposes by direct determination of inulin by HPLC with refractive index detection.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D002851', 'D002523', 'D005504', 'D005515', 'D007054', 'D007444', 'D008892', 'D009844']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Labeling', 'Ice Cream', 'Inulin', 'Milk', 'Oligosaccharides']",Inulin determination for food labeling.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11599989,2001

Diversity of proteolytic and especially lipolytic activity within Y. lipolytica strains isolated from dairy products was observed. In particular, the degree of specificity for saturated or unsaturated fatty acids as well as for even- or odd-numbered carbon free fatty acids (FFAs) varied among the strains. The RAPD-PCR profiles showed low genetic relatedness between many of the food isolates and the type strain of the species. Such genetic variability needs to be further evaluated.

Three cheese batches were made, one from raw milk, another from pasteurized milk, and a third from pasteurized milk with an added native starter culture in addition to the commercial starter. Cheeses were analyzed at 1, 120, and 240 d of ripening. Analysis of the volatile components was by purge and trap connected to a gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer and disclosed a total of 76 components belonging to the following chemical families: hydrocarbons, fatty acids, esters, sulfur and carbonyl compounds, and, in particular, alcohols. Pasteurization lowered the levels of certain volatile components, especially alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones. The cheeses made from pasteurized milk showed lower scores for attributes of characteristic taste and aftertaste, as well as a characteristic aroma at 240 d of ripening. These results suggest that the components present in higher concentrations in the cheeses made from the raw milk were necessary for development of characteristic Roncal cheese aroma.

11358181,"Dioxins/furans are ubiquitous environmental contaminants whose primary route of human exposure occurs via the consumption of fatty foods of animal origin. The US FDA conducted a market basket survey of dairy products and commercial fish and shellfish to obtain data on levels of 17 dioxin/furan congeners (2, 3, 7, 8-congeners) in the US. The dairy products sampled included various cheeses (American, cheddar, Swiss, cottage), ice cream, yogurt, butter, and milk. The finfish and shellfish (molluscs and crustacea) sampled are those marine species consumed in the greatest amounts and include canned tuna, shrimp, cod, blue crab, and oysters. Catfish was sampled because it is the dominant aquaculture species. Samples were collected in 1995/96 and analysis for 17 dioxin/furan congeners was performed by high-resolution gas chromatography following extraction and clean-up. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for each congener in each food were reported. Point estimates of exposure were calculated using a 3-day (1-day diary plus 2-day recall) food consumption survey for eaters-only and for the general population (USDA/CSFII, 1989-92). Toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) were used to derive overall dioxin/furan toxicity equivalents (TEQ) for each sample food. Mean estimates of TEQ exposure for each food were derived using five values for non-detects (ND = 0; ND = 1/2 LOD or LOQ, ND = LOD or LOQ) on both a total sample and eaters-only basis. Using zero and the LOD provide lower and upper bounds on the range of estimated exposure, respectively. The bounds on mean dioxin intakes (pg/person/day) calculated for consumers of specific foods were estimated as follows (using zero or LOD for non-detects): butter (0.5-11), cheese (1.6-3.2), ice cream (4-19), yogurt (0.8-28), catfish (148-150), fish (other than catfish) (0.03-9), crustacea (32-35), mollusks (16.1-16.6), and shrimp (0.09-4.5). Exposure estimates derived by the five ND-methods are strongly dependent on the LOD and LOQ and represent upper bound estimates of exposure.

11162402,"The recovery of cheese-whey proteins and lactose represents an important task both in environmental and in food sciences. Optimization of whey processing requires the quantitative separation of whey proteins from lactose, lower costs, harmless environmental impact, flexibility in protein recovery, and adaptability of the process to type and amount of available whey. Here we present a method based on the use of self-made, low-price, and nontoxic hydroxyapatite for one-step separation of lactose (non adsorbed) from bovine whey proteins (adsorbed). Recovery of proteins can be performed with high flexibility. Total protein fraction can be eluted with 0.4 M phosphate at pH 7.0. In alternative, proteins can be recovered in pairs with 0.4 M phosphate but at different pH's. About 56% of the proteins, primarily alpha-lactalbulmin and IgG, were eluted at pH 5.0. The other major proteins, beta-lactoglobulin and BSA, were eluted at pH 6.0. Fractions eluted with the two first eluants at pH 5.0 and pH 6.0 were applied to a Superdex 75 column for final purification by gel filtration.

11132840,"Volatile sulfur compounds such as methanethiol, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and hydrogen sulfide constitute an important fraction of Cheddar cheese flavor. These compounds are products of the catabolism of methionine and cysteine by bacteria in the cheese matrix. The objectives of this study were to examine the levels and types of volatile sulfur compounds produced from methionine by lactic acid bacteria frequently used in cheese making and to investigate cystathionine degrading activity, which may be responsible for the liberation of these compounds. Gas chromatography with headspace sampling was used to determine volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) produced by whole cells of 24 strains of lactobacilli and 13 strains of lactococci incubated with methionine. Total VSC production varied widely in the species and subspecies tested. Nearly all strains produced VSC from methionine, but the enzyme responsible for this activity remains unclear. Cystathionine-degrading ability and the effect of methionine concentration on this ability of some of the strains was investigated. Increasing the concentrations of methionine inhibited the cystathionine-degrading ability of lactococci, but not of lactobacilli. Lactococci were found to require methionine for growth, while lactobacilli required both methionine and cysteine. Because of the low level of cystathionine-degrading activity in lactobacilli and the inhibition of this activity by methionine in lactococci, VSC production is likely due to enzymes other than cystathionine beta- and gamma-lyase in whole cells.",Journal of dairy science,"['D002611', 'D002849', 'D003542', 'D003545', 'D005516', 'D007778', 'D017045', 'D008715', 'D013457', 'D013649']","['Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Cystathionine gamma-Lyase', 'Cysteine', 'Food Microbiology', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lactococcus', 'Methionine', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Taste']",Diversity of sulfur compound production in lactic acid bacteria.,"['Q000382', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000201', 'Q000201', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None]","['microbiology', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'enzymology', 'enzymology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11132840,2001

A reduction of fat content resulted in significant increases in contents of moisture and protein and a decrease in the concentration of moisture in nonfat substance. Reduced fat had little effect on the age-related changes in the population of starter cells. The populations of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria decreased with fat content, and counts in the low fat cheese (6% wt/wt) were significantly lower than those in the full fat cheese (33% wt/wt) at ripening times >1 and <180 d. Proteolysis as measured by the percentage of total N soluble at pH 4.6 or in 70% ethanol decreased significantly as the fat content decreased. However, the content of pH 4.6 soluble N per 100 g of cheese was not significantly influenced by fat content. At ripening times >60 d, the content of 70% ethanol soluble N per 100 g of full fat (33% wt/wt) cheese was significantly lower than that in either the half fat (17% wt/wt) or low fat (6% wt/wt) cheeses. The concentration of AA N, as a percentage of total N, was not significantly affected by fat content.

Samples were split into two groups and stored at 5+/-0.5 degrees C. One group was analyzed for DEHA content at intervals between 1 and 240 h of contact (kinetic study), and a second group was cut into slices (1.2 mm thick) after 240 h of cheese/PVC contact and was analyzed for DEHA content (penetration study). The DEHA was determined by indirect gas chromatography. Statistically significant differences in migration of DEHA were observed between the cheese types. Migration of DEHA depended on contact time, fat, and moisture contents, and consistency of cheese samples. Equilibrium conditions were approached after approximately 100 h of contact for Edam and 150 h for Kefalotyri cheese. Equilibrium conditions were not reached for Feta cheese, even after 240 h of contact. After 240 h of contact under refrigeration, the migration of DEHA was approximately 345.4 mg/kg (18.9 mg/dm2) for Kefalotyri, 222.5 mg/kg (12.2 mg/dm2) for Edam, and 133.9 mg/kg (7.3 mg/dm2) for Feta. The loss of DEHA from the PVC film into the three cheese types was 37.8, 24.3, and 14.6%, respectively. These values, with the exception of Feta, were higher than the upper limit for global migration from plastic packaging materials into food and food stimulants set by the European Union (EU) (10 mg/dm2 or 60 mg/kg).

The chromatographic analysis of flavors and off-flavors in foods usually requires that the samples first be processed to remove as many interfering compounds as possible. For analysis of foods by gas chromatography (GC), sample preparation may include mincing, homogenation, centrifugation, distillation, simple solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized-fluid extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, Soxhlet extraction, or methylation. For high-performance liquid chromatography of amines in fish, cheese, sausage and olive oil or aldehydes in fruit juice, sample preparation may include solvent extraction and derivatization.

All strains investigated by the agar diffusion tests possessed esterase activity and 23 strains were also able to hydrolyse olive oil, but differences in esterase activity were seen. The agar diffusion tests and the titration of FFA showed that the amount of FFA released by a strain of P. roqueforti is determined by both esterase and lipase activity. A large release of FFA was only seen for strains with the ability to hydrolyse both short- and long-chained fatty acids, while strains with esterase activity produced smaller amounts of FFA. Between 7 and 14 days of incubation a steep increase in the release of FFA was observed both by the titration and by GC analysis, and then a decline from 14 to 21 days, probably caused by conversion of FFA to methyl ketones. Identical FFA profiles were found for two strains with different lipolytic activity.

In addition, the enterococcal adjunct strain did not affect cheese composition. Although sensory evaluation showed no significant difference in flavor/aroma and body/texture scores between control and experimental cheeses, repeated comments by the commercial grader consistently described the cheeses containing PR88 as 'more advanced than the control' and as having 'better flavor'.

The odor potency was assessed by values of best estimate-GC-lower amount detected by sniffing (BE-GC-LOADS). For small and medium chain S-methyl thioesters, these values were found to increase from 6 ng for S-methyl thiobutanoate to 90 ng for S-methyl thiostearate. All assessors detected a ""green"", ""floral"", or ""pineapple"" odor for S-methyl thiohexanoate and described thioesters containing a 2-6 carbon chain length as ""cheesy"". The results of this preliminary analysis were confirmed by a more extensive study of selected compounds, namely S-methyl thioacetate, S-methyl thiopropionate, S-methyl thiobutanoate, and S-methyl thiohexanoate, using a trained panel of 18 subjects. The subjects confirmed the presence of the ""green"" and ""fruity"" notes in the odor of S-methyl thiohexanoate. The analysis also revealed a significant difference in the odor of S-methyl thiopropionate relative to that of S-methyl thioacetate and S-methyl thiobutanoate.

In this study, several bioactive peptides, mainly potential antihypertensive peptides from enzyme-modified cheese prepared by commercial and Lactobacillus casei enzymes, were purified and identified. Enzyme-modified cheese samples were prepared by combination of Neutrase (1883.0 U/ml), L. casei enzymes (amino peptidase activity 86.4 leucine aminopeptidase U/g), and Debitrase (22.0 leucine aminopeptidase U/g). The water-soluble fractions of the enzyme-modified cheeses that were prepared by different enzymes were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC on a Delta Pak C18 column. Each peak was purified on the same column using a binary gradient. One peak from the Neutrase digest, five peaks from the Neutrase-Debitrase digest, and two peaks from the Neutrase-Lactobacillus enzyme digest were purified and identified by API mass spectrometry. On the basis of their molecular masses, amino acid sequences of purified peptides were identified. beta-Casomorphin with a sequence like that of beta-casein (YPFPGPI f 60-66) was found after the Neutrase digest. All of the peptides purified from the digests with combination of Neutrase and Debitrase or Neutrase and L. casei enzymes contained active sites in their sequences.

Generally, in a chemically bonded anion-exchange resin, many hydroxyl groups are introduced on the surface of the resin in order to make the resin hydrophilic. The borate as an eluting reagent also reacts to these hydroxyl groups, and this complex formation decreases the apparent ion-exchange capacity of the column by being dissociated to the anion depending on the eluent pH. In the present work a method is described for the simultaneous determination of anions based on the capacity gradient for suppressed ion chromatography. A Tosoh IC-Anion-PW column and dihydroxyphenylborane-mannitol eluent system were used. To maintain baseline stability, it was helpful to keep the borate concentration constant during a gradient of 16 to 0 mM mannitol as a modifier to prevent the complex formation with the hydroxyl on the resin.

Concentrations of presumptive C. tyrobutyricum endospores (defined by subterminal endospore position and lactate dehydrogenase activity) were lower, not exceeding 2.0 x 10(-2) MPN ml(-1). Based on subterminal endospore position, lactate dehydrogenase activity, and a carbohydrate fermentation profile identical to C. tyrobutyricum strain ATCC 25755, five isolates (Ct) were initially characterized as C. tyrobutyricum, a known cause of late-blowing in high-pH cheeses. Twenty-eight other isolates (Cx) produced gas from lactate, but differed from ATCC 25755 in either endospore position, lactate dehydrogenase activity or carbohydrate fermentation profile. When inoculated at high concentrations in Gouda cheese, strain ATCC 25755, two Ct isolates and 18 Cx isolates tested produced gas during ripening. Among the five Ct isolates obtained and two reference strains confirmed as C. tyrobutyricum, there were four qualitatively different volatile organic acid byproduct profiles. Each of the two confirmed C. tyrobutyricum reference strains and five Ct isolates had distinct quantitative cell membrane fatty acid (CMFA) profiles. The Cx isolates represented 14 different volatile organic acid byproduct profiles and each isolate had a unique CMFA profile.

Acid-hydrolyzed samples are subjected to solid phase extraction; then they are dried and redissolved before injection. The electrophoresis separation is performed in a fused silica capillary tube (50 microns inside diameter) with an extended-path-length detection cell using a 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid solution at pH 7.0 as run buffer. The in-laboratory repeatability was within +/- 7.1% at the 95% confidence level when the amount of furosine ranged between 8 and 250 mg per 100 g protein. The values of both repeatability and sensitivity fulfill the requirements stated in the EU and Italian regulations for furosine determination in pasteurized milk and Mozzarella cheese. The data obtained on 48 different food samples including heat-treated milk, cheeses, and durum wheat products were comparable with those obtained by an HPLC method and proved to be accurate for furosine values up to at least 400 mg per 100 g protein.

The method may be used to demonstrate compliance with the guidelines of the U.S. Nutrition Labeling and Education Act for labeling products as ""fat free"" or ""low fat."" The method can measure total and saturated fat in savory snacks when present at levels of 0.2-10 g total fat and 0.1-3 g saturated fat per 30 g serving. The method is standardized to measure C6-C24 fatty acids. Extraction of olestra-containing savory snack samples with chloroform-methanol (modified AOAC Official Method 983.23) yields a lipid extract containing the total fat and olestra. The extracted lipid is hydrolyzed by lipase, yielding fatty acids and unreacted olestra. The fatty acids are precipitated as calcium soaps. Olestra is extracted from insoluble soaps with hexane and then discarded. The isolated soaps are converted back into fatty acids with hydrochloric acid and extracted with hexane. The isolated fatty acids are converted to methyl esters with boron trifluoride-methanol and quantitated by capillary gas chromatography using internal standard. Test samples were prepared by blending olestra-containing and full-fat (triglyceride) snacks to obtain 6 levels of spiking (0-10 g total fat added/30 g serving) in potato chips, potato crisps, cheese puffs, and nacho cheese-flavored corn chips. Results were linear (r2 > 0.997) between 0 and 10 g fat/30 g serving for each product matrix. Mean recovery was 101 +/- 6% standard deviation (SD) for total fat and 104 +/- 6% SD for saturated fat.

Consequently, an increase in the daily intake of folates is warranted, which emphasizes the need for quantitative as well as qualitative measurements of dietary folates. Milk plays an important part in the food chain in many Western countries today. Several studies suggest that folate-binding proteins might have an impact on folate absorption and therefore their concentrations are also important. The mean concentration of the predominant form of folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3THF), was determined using HPLC in thirteen selected dairy products; skim milk powder, two pasteurized milks, UHT milk, two fermented milks, three whey products and four different cheeses. All results were corrected for recovery by spiking the samples with 5-CH3THF. Effects of storage of dairy products on 5-CH3THF concentrations were also investigated; generally small and insignificant fluctuations were found, except for hard cheese, in which 5-CH3THF decreased significantly.

Positive identification of 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid (MTCA) is demonstrated in soy and tabasco sauces, wine, beer, wine vinegar, cider, orange juice, toasted bread, blue cheese and yoghurt. 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid (THCA) occurs in toasted bread, beer, cider, wine vinegar, soy and tabasco sauce, orange juice and blue cheese. MTCA and THCA are reported for the first time in several of these products. MTCA appears as a mixture of two diastereoisomers with the same mass spectra. MTCA is the major TH beta C-3-COOH in foodstuffs except for toasted bread that contains more THCA. GC-MS analysis of N-methoxycarbonyl methyl ester derivatives of TH beta C-3-COOHs was used for chemical identification. Those derivatives were synthesized in a qualitatively using methyl chloroformate or methyl chloroformate and diazomethane reagents.

The mass spectra were submitted to principal component analysis, canonical variates analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, producing a final dendrogram by the use of average linkage clustering. By this approach a successful classification of the species Penicillium italicum, P. expansum and P. digitatum originating from fruits was obtained. Isolates of the same species grouped together in the dendrogram, while the different species were distinguished. Also when grown on two different agar media, replicates of the same species grouped together. Likewise, a satisfactory classification was achieved by multivariate analysis of the data for various isolates of the cheese-associated fungi Aspergillus versicolor, P. discolor, P. roqueforti, P. solitum, P. verrucosum, P. commune and P. palitans. However, some difficulties appeared in distinguishing the closely related species P. commune and P. palitans. Such difficulties became greater on including more isolates and limiting the analysis to five of the species. The use of back-propagation artificial neural networks, in contrast, resulted in a correct classification in all cases.

Sigma PCB concentrations (sum of 37 congeners) ranged from 3.4-16.4 ng/g milk fat with a mean sigma PCB concentration of 8.4 ng/g milk fat. The dominating congeners were 118, 153, 138 and 180, which contributed 15%, 20%, 17% and 9% of the sigma PCB load respectively. The chlorine pattern of the congeners which made moderate or major contributions to the sigma PCB concentration were typically substituted at both para positions (4,4'), while the PCB congeners not detected in the milk had at least one ring that was not 4-substituted. These results indicate the 4,4' substitution pattern as being the key to PCB persistence in cows.

Candidate extraction methods were initially checked for recovery and reproducibility by spiking commodities at a level of 200 micrograms/kg of sterigmatocystin and using HPLC with post-column derivatization. Recovery was found to be greater than 90% for bread and maize, and 75% for cheese. Mass spectrometer conditions for detecting sterigmatocystin were established by injecting solutions directly into the mass spectrometer. Extracts of bread, maize grits and cheese prepared by the candidate extraction methods were examined using HPLC/MS using samples spiked at a level of 20 micrograms/kg of sterigmatocystin. Results for bread and maize samples showed that the extraction procedure recovered more than 90% of added sterigmatocystin and produced extracts free of interference from co-extractives, with limits of detection of less than 2 micrograms/kg for both commodities.

8552964,"Histamine poisoning is a foodborne chemical intoxication resulting from the ingestion of food products containing high levels of histamine. Historically, histamine poisoning has been attributed to the consumption of fish species belonging to the Scomberesocidae and Scombridae families and other sea fish, but histamine poisoning outbreaks may occur after the consumption of cheese, or other types of fermented foods. Also tyramine has been proved as a cause of adverse reactions, involving headache, hypertensive crisis and interactions with antidepressive drugs, which were observed after consumption of ripening cheeses. The formation of high levels of histamine and tyramine in foods is directly correlated to the level of microorganisms, possessing the enzymes: histidine and tyrozyne decarboxylases, and also with the concentration of histidine and tyrosine free substrate. Proteolysis, which takes place during ripening of cheeses may play role in the release of free histidine and tyrosine. This study reports on the levels of histamine and tyramine in ripening cheeses taken from Polish food market. 43 samples of soft and hard cheeses were investigated. Histamine was measured according to the AOAC fluorometric method.

A simple solvent extraction with dichloromethane followed by a washing step with N-hexane gives a prepurified extract. A comparison between two ways of aflatoxin M1 purification, by solid-phase extraction clean-up and by immunoaffinity, was carried out. The use of immunoaffinity columns containing monoclonal antibodies against aflatoxin M1 gives the best result, i.e. a very clean preparation containing purified aflatoxin M1. The quantification of aflatoxin M1 is then performed by high performance liquid chromatography using fluorometric detection. This method was successfully carried out on naturally-contaminated and spiked cheeses. Recoveries are about 75%. The limit of quantification is 0.020 microgram of aflatoxin M1 per kg of cheese.

After its use there may be residues present in ovine milk that interfere with cheese making and processing of other milk products. It is important to monitor for the presence of tilmicosin in ovine milk and a method has been optimized and validated for its determination. Tilmicosin is extracted from milk into methanol. The methanol extract is acidified and non-polar co-extractives removed using hexane followed by carbon tetrachloride. The pH is adjusted to 9.0 and the tilmicosin partitioned into chloroform. The chloroform extract is evaporated to dryness and the residue resuspended in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) mobile phase.

8064267,"In a two-part crossover study, ten healthy men drank a moderate dose of ethanol (0.80 g/kg) in the morning after an overnight fast or immediately after breakfast. The breakfast consisted of orange juice (150 mL), fruit yogurt (250 mL), two cheese sandwiches, one boiled egg, and one cup of coffee with milk and sugar. Ethanol was determined in venous blood at various times after the start of drinking by headspace gas chromatography. All subjects felt less intoxicated when alcohol was ingested after breakfast compared with drinking on an empty stomach. The peak BAC (+/- SD) was 67 +/- 9.5 mg/dL (ethanol + food) compared with 104 +/- 16.5 mg/dL when the drinking occurred after an overnight fast (P < 0.001). The mean area under the alcohol concentration-time profile (0-->6h) was 398 +/- 56 mg/dL x h in the fasting state compared with 241 +/- 34 mg/dL x h when subjects drank alcohol after the meal (P < 0.001). The time required to metabolize the dose of ethanol was approximately two hours shorter after the subjects had eaten breakfast. These results suggest that food in the stomach before drinking not only leads to a lowering of the peak BAC and diminishes the feelings of intoxication, but also boosts the rate of ethanol metabolism. A food-induced increase in the rate of disposal of ethanol was also confirmed when subjects ate a meal 5 h after drinking, that is, when the postabsorptive phase of ethanol metabolism was well established.

Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis FH041 was transformed by electroporation with plasmids pCI3601, pCI3602, or pNZ521. Plasmids pCI3601 and pCI3602 harbor the cloned proteinase genes of L. lactis ssp. lactis UC317 on a high copy number vector and, as such, encode an increased concentration of cell wall-associated and secreted enzymes, respectively. Plasmid pNZ521 contains the cloned proteinase genes from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris SK11. Assessment of proteolysis and flavor development in Cheddar cheese made with these strains revealed that starter proteinases are required for the accumulation of small peptides and free amino acids in Cheddar cheese. Proteolysis was not enhanced by an approximately threefold increase in concentration of the lactococcal proteinase. The strain in which the proteinase remained attached to the cell wall appeared to contribute more to proteolysis than the strain that secreted the enzyme.

Detection is performed by UV absorbance at 214 nm. Recoveries ranged from 96.1 to 105.0%. Decomposition of the sweetener was observed in most food samples. However, the total aspartame values (measured aspartame + breakdown products) were within -10% and +5% of the declared levels.

8314395,"Levels of mineral hydrocarbons which have migrated from wax coatings into cheese have been determined for 20 retail samples using a gas chromatographic procedure. Contamination was limited to the outermost 2 mm of cheese in direct contact with the wax where levels of hydrocarbons were found to range from 10 to 150 mg/kg. On a whole cheese weight basis these amounted to < 1 to 27 mg/kg (< 0.2 to 3 mg/dm2 contact area). Components attributed to hydrocarbons in cheese samples remote from the waxed surface (background levels) were typically 3-5 mg/kg. Background levels were subtracted from the results for surface samples to obtain migration values. There was evidence that the surface contamination of cheese with mineral hydrocarbons occurred by a combination of diffusion into the cheese and adhesion of wax components onto its surface. Mineral hydrocarbons are used in the manufacture of the temporary casings used to mould skinless sausages. Of 33 retail products examined, including skinless sausages, hot-dog sausages and frankfurters, 25 (75%) contained levels of mineral hydrocarbons from 10 to 105 mg/kg. These hydrocarbons were shown to be present principally at the surface of the food and so could be attributed to migration. Nine other minced meat products were examined for comparison, including minced beef, pâté, sausage meat and sausages with skins. Levels of mineral oil in these products were insignificant by comparison, typically below the limit of detection of ca 4 mg/kg, indicating insignificant adventitious contamination from routes other than migration.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002611', 'D002849', 'D005506', 'D006838', 'D008461', 'D008899', 'D013552', 'D014885']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Food Contamination', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Meat Products', 'Mineral Oil', 'Swine', 'Waxes']",Migration of mineral hydrocarbons into foods. 3.

Since the kit is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system equipped with polyvalent antisera against staphylococcal enterotoxin types A to E (SEA to SEE) and the test is simple and rapid to perform (4 h), it has been widely used for screening purposes. In this study, the sensitivity of the kit for detection of SEA, SEB, and SEC in ham, cheese, and mushrooms was similar to those of kits based on an enzyme immunoassay and reversed passive latex agglutination: 0.75 to 1.0 ng of SEA per ml, 0.5 to 0.75 ng of SEB per ml, and 1.0 to 1.25 ng of SEC per ml. However, the TECRA kit showed nonspecific reactions with food samples contaminated by microorganisms other than Staphylococcus aureus, such as Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. The substance contributing to the false-positive results differed from true staphylococcal enterotoxins in that it was (i) heat labile (completely inactivated by heating for 2 min at 100 degrees C, whereas true staphylococcal enterotoxins were inactivated by about 10% with this treatment), (ii) lower in molecular weight than staphylococcal enterotoxins, and (iii) not bound to a copper chelate Sepharose gel (all of the substance remained in the unbound wash fraction, whereas staphylococcal enterotoxins were quantitatively bound to the gel).

The results of these migration studies were obtained by direct measurement using newly developed analytical methods utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infra-red (IR) spectroscopy as well as predictively from assessment of loss of polyisobutylene from the film. Total levels of polyisobutylene migration into cheese were found to be 8-10 mg/kg, into cake 1-5 mg/kg, and into sandwiches ranged from < 1 to 4 mg/kg. Reheating foods covered with film in the microwave oven, gave migration levels ranging from < 0.01 mg/kg for contact with steam only, up to 0.5 mg/kg for severe splashing of food onto the film and 4 mg/kg for reheated pizza.

Slices (20 microns) of cheese from the boundary layer, into which DEHA had migrated, were microtomed at -40 degrees C, and analyzed for DEHA by gas chromatography (GC). Mean values of Df determined by graph fitting experimental and calculated data were 1.5 x 10(-9) cm2 s-1 at 5 degrees C and 3.0 x 10(-8) cm2 s-1 at 25 degrees C. The partition coefficient (K) of DEHA between cheese and PVC film was derived from the partition coefficients of DEHA between acetonitrile (ACN) and cheese lipid, ACN and cheese solid, and ACN and PVC film. The mean values of K between cheese and PVC film were estimated to be 0.70 at 5 degrees C and 0.58 at 25 degrees C. The estimated values of Df and K were then used in a mathematical model (Till et al. 1982) to predict migration levels of DEHA into cheese. Good agreement with previously published experimental data was obtained. Extrapolation of the prediction of DEHA migration into fatty foods, such as salami and avocado, was also successful (ratio of experimental to predicted results within a factor of two). The values of Df and K for cheese are, however, inappropriate for modelling non-fatty foods such as meat, cakes, fruit and vegetables. Predicted values for these foods were typically 3-10-fold too high. More accurate predictions would probably be obtained if values of Df more relevant to these foods are used.

The procedure requires blending of soft samples, e.g. raisins, prunes, or oranges, and ultrasonic homogenization of hard samples, e.g. wheat, cocoa beans, corn, or nuts, with portions of water and ice so the final temperature of the food-water slurry is less than 1 degree C. A 20 g aliquot (4 g food) is then added to a cold headspace vial containing 4 g sodium sulfate. Losses of MB during a 3.5 min ultrasonic homogenization of wheat were 11% at 0.95 ppb and 4.4% at 4.8 ppb. For flour, cocoa, and finely divided spices, which do not require blending, 4 g is added to the cold headspace vial containing 16 mL cold water and 4 g sodium sulfate. Studies show that comminution of wheat or peanuts must be carried out to release MB trapped within the food so the headspace equilibrium can be attained in 1 h as well as to obtain homogeneous samples and representative sampling. No interferences were noted with the above foods or with many grain-based baking mixes analyzed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,"['D002611', 'D002849', 'D004041', 'D002523', 'D004563', 'D005433', 'D005504', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D006842', 'D007202', 'D010316', 'D012987']","['Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Dietary Fats', 'Edible Grain', 'Electrochemistry', 'Flour', 'Food Analysis', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrocarbons, Brominated', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Particle Size', 'Soil']",Determination of methyl bromide in foods by headspace capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2808244,1989

Both methods enable a simple and quick sample preparation since the separation of beta-carotene and fat is not required. The sample preparation step consists of extraction with acetone, filtration, evaporation of the extract and separation of water residues by the addition of a few milliliters of absolute ethanol. This is followed by evaporation and extraction of the residual solution with chloroform/acetic acid (99.5 +/- 0.5) for the derivative spectroscopic method or with acetone for the HPLC method. The qualitative detection (detection limit greater than 0.67 mg/kg, depending on the genuine beta-carotene content) as well as the quantitative determination is possible by means of the derivative spectroscopic method. Therefore, this technique may be used within the rigorous Austrian regulations or for controlling the quantities and limits of annatto dye-stuffs in cheese, if its application is allowed. The method also has the advantage of quick detection (only 75 s) and saving of material used.

These penicillia, which are representative of species that have caused considerable taxonomic confusion, had common micromorphology (terverticillate penicilli with rough and smooth stipes and smooth ellipsoidal to subglobose [(3 to 5) X 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 microns] conidia); growth rates; good growth on creatine sucrose agar, cheese, and other products with a high amount of protein and lipid as a primary habitat; production (with the exception of Penicillium solitum) of cyclopiazonic acid; and the ability to grow at low temperatures and water activities. The isolates that were investigated proved to be strictly antigenically related. Absorbed antiserum of the green-spored mutant of P. camemberti showed a specific precipitin band when tested by immunodiffusion either with its homologous reference antigen or with the exoantigens obtained from different isolates. The precipitin band was not present in any P. camemberti starter culture but in many unwanted cheese contaminants. The precipitin band can be used in the purity control of P. camemberti starter culture spore preparations. Analysis of the exoantigens of all the cultures by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography allowed us to subdivide these penicillia into nine groups below the species level.

Samples are stirred with water and purged with nitrogen for 0.5 h in a water bath at 100 degrees C. The analytes collected on a duplex trap composed of Tenax TA and XAD-4 resin are eluted with hexane and determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detection or Hall electrolytic conductivity detection. Flame photometric detection in the sulfur mode is used to determine carbon disulfide. Thick-film, wide-bore capillary columns are used exclusively in both the determination and confirmation of the halogenated analytes. The higher levels of analytes are also confirmed by full scan gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Samples are analyzed for carbon disulfide, methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, 1,2-dibromoethane, and tetrachloroethylene. Initially, 19 table-ready foods from the Food and Drug Administration's Total Diet Study were analyzed by this method.

Recoveries of all 9 analytes from fortified samples ranged from 83 to 104%. Chromatograms from this purge and trap method are clean, enabling quantitation levels of low parts per billion and sub-parts per billion to be achieved for the halogenated analytes.

In three earlier parts in this series, the varieties, cultivation, and primary processing; the processed products, world production, and trade; and the chemistry of the color, aroma, and pungency stimuli have been reviewed. In this part, the evaluation of quality through instrumental determination of the causal components and the sensory evaluation of color, aroma, and pungency are discussed. Several methods for quantitative determination of the stimuli and the sensory evaluation of the responses to the stimuli are reviewed. The problems of sensory evaluation of color, aroma, and pungency, the dominant attributes for validation of the instrumentally determined values for carotenoids, volatiles, or particular fractions, and total and individual capsaicinoids are specifically discussed. Summarized details of selected instrumental methods for evaluating the stimuli, which are either validated by correlation to sensorily perceived responses or to adopted standards, are given along with representative data obtained for discussing the adequacy and reliability of the methods. Pungency as a specific gustatory perception and the many methods proposed to evaluate this quality are discussed. A recommended objective procedure for obtaining reproducible values is discussed, and a method for relating different panel results is shown.

The loss of AN during equilibration at 100 degrees C in meat samples as well as the previously described loss in cold pack cheese and peanut butter has been studied. The loss of AN could be prevented by the addition of 10% phosphoric acid, which increases the acidity of the food-acid-salt slurry to pH 1.2-1.5. This acidification permits detection of AN at 2 ppb (5% FSD at 16 X 10(-2) amp/mV) in all foods studied.

Several selected applications are discussed in detail. The large diversity of proteins in a particular food results in a unique electrophoretic or chromatographic pattern, that can be used for identification purposes, by means of the so called indicator proteins. The adaptability and resolving power of the methods assure their extended application to many protein containing foods. The uniqueness of the patterns obtained warranties differentiations of even closely related animal or plant foods as well as mixtures of them. The methods also allow quantitative determinations of mixtures of foods. Their ease of handling and good reproducibility and reliability favours their use in routine analyses.

3874939,"Whey is a by-product of the manufacture of cheese from milk. The usual practice is to dispose of it, the usage of whey being not sufficiently developed, though it contains proteins of excellent quality such as beta-lactoglobulin and alpha-lactalbumin. Interaction between kappa-casein and whey protein was examined in order to form new food materials. Gelation of the heat-induced complex between kappa-casein and alpha-lactalbumin is described in this paper. alpha-Lactalbumin was easily separated from whey protein by the gel filtration technique on a Toyopearl HW-50 column at pH 6.0. Heat treatment facilitated the hydrolysis of a mixture of kappa-casein and alpha-lactalbumin by trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin and pronase. Heat treatment at above 75 degrees C and a protein level of over 5% were needed to form gel in 35 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.4 M NaCl. The temperature was in agreement with that at which alpha-lactalbumin denatured and formed the complex with kappa-casein. Decrease of soluble protein concentration and increase of turbidity were induced with gelation. Gel was not formed when only kappa-casein or alpha-lactalbumin was heated under the appropriate conditions. It was considered that a kappa-casein-alpha-lactalbumin gel was formed from a complex of the two proteins by heat treatment. The breaking stress of kappa-casein-alpha-lactalbumin gel was less than that of kappa-casein-beta-lactoglobulin gel. If the pH was reduced to 5.8 after complex formation by the two proteins, gel was formed at a low protein concentration compared with that with no alteration of pH.",Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,"['D002364', 'D002850', 'D002918', 'D004220', 'D005782', 'D006358', 'D006863', 'D006868', 'D007768', 'D007785', 'D046911', 'D011402', 'D013053', 'D014357']","['Caseins', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chymotrypsin', 'Disulfides', 'Gels', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis', 'Lactalbumin', 'Lactose', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Pronase', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Trypsin']",Gelation of the heat-induced complex between kappa-casein and alpha-lactalbumin.,"['Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","['metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3874939,1985

To a large degree, the differences reflected the consumption of corn-fed animal products in the United States and Japan, as well as seafood in Japan. The carbon isotopic composition of hair (-16.4, -18.0 and -20.4%) for the three respective populations correlated with the calculated values of the dietary protein, but were 2-3% enriched in 13C.

The amounts of iodine in nationally representative samples of prepared and cooked groups of foods and in a wide variety of individual foods and food products were determined colorimetrically. The amounts of erythrosine, a red food colour containing 577 mg I/g were also determined in selected foods and diets by high-performance liquid chromatography. 2. The average British diet was calculated to provide 323 micrograms I/d but only 255 micrograms if two fruit samples containing large amounts of glacé cherries were discounted. Of the total, 92 micrograms was derived from liquid milk. Meat and meat products provided 36 micrograms and cereal products 31 micrograms, but fresh fruits and sugars, vegetables and beverages provided little I. Fish and fish products, though rich in I, contributed only 5% to the total intake. 3. Milk was the most variable as well as the most important individual source of I. Summer milk samples contained 70 micrograms/kg and winter milk 370 micrograms/kg on average. Milk products, including butter and cheese, and eggs were also rich in I. 4. Some processed foods contained erythrosine, particularly glacé cherries and some pink or red confectionery items, biscuits, cherry cake, canned strawberries and luncheon meat. However, none of these are major foods in the average household diet and erythrosine would therefore contribute little more than 10 micrograms I/d to most diets. 5.

567180,"The present paper briefly summarizes the research activities of the Food Research Laboratories, Canadian Health Protection Branch, during the past two years. Data presented indicate that traces of nitrosamines, mainly nitrosodimethylamine and nitrosodiethylamine, can occur in cheese. Several new analytical methods are presented for the determination of non-volatile nitroso compounds, such as nitrosohydroxypyrrolidine, nitrosodiethanolamine, nitrosoproline, nitrosohydroxyproline and nitrosoglyphosphate (a nitrosated herbicide). It is shown that all of the above compounds, even the very polar nitrosoglyphosphate, can be converted to volatile derivatives and then analysed by GLC-MS or by conventional GLC using a specific (such as P-photometric) detector. Traces of nitrosohydroxypyrrolidine have been detected in a few samples of cooked bacon.

567178,"A further series of cured meat products (meat loaf, liver loaf, bologna) has been investigated for their nitrosamine contents before and after frying. Contents in general were in the low microgram/kg range. An extensive study of nitrosamine contents of various types of cheese has been terminated. Although 45% of all samples showed indications of nitrosamine content, only 12% had concentrations of greater than 1 microgram/kg (1-6 microgram/kg); NDMA was more often found in hard and in soft cheese, than in other types. Analytical grade dichloromethane and chloroform have been found to contain N-nitrosomorpholine in concentrations of 2-376 microgram/kg (27-40% of the samples). The origin of the contamination is not known at present. A survey of the nitrosamine content of animal diets showed that 80% of all samples had contents of greater than 1 microgram/kg. NDMA (up to 79 microgram/kg) and NPYR (up to 26 microgram/kg) were most often found. There are indications that fish meal is the main source of contamination. Drugs containing amidopyrine (AP) have invariably been found to contain NDMA. Concentrations varied within wide limits (less than 10 microgram/kg - 371 microgram/kg). No correlation has been found between samples of pure AP and NDMA contents of drugs in which pure AP had been incorporated. Also, strong variations in NDMA contents have been found within individual batches, probably caused by the high reactivity of AP towards nitrogen oxides. The determination of N-nitroso-3-hydroxypyrrolidine has been further improved and a further series of food analyses for contents of this nitrosamine has been carried out. About 30% of the samples were positive with contents below or near 10 microgram/kg. An analytical method for determination of N-nitrosamino acids has been worked out. The method consists of a series of extraction, liquid/liquid distribution and chromatography steps; N-nitrosoamino acids are finally determined, after trimethylsilylation, with a TEA detector.

404556,"Since the extensive veterinary-hygienic treatment of herds with insecticidal veterinary preparations may lead to milk contamination, the authors studied the behaviour of some active agents (butonate, dichlorvos (DDVP), trichlorphon, naled, carbaryl, hexachloro-p-xylene and rafoxanide) during the industrial processing of milk to fluid milk, cream, butter, cheese and milk powder, and during the storage of these products. Small-scale model experiments served to investigate the effects of pasteurization (74 and 95 degrees C.), separation and churning as well as of the processing to milk powder and cheese. Analyses for residues were performed by thin-layer chromatography, colorimetry and with the aid of the isotope technique. From the viewpoint of milk processing, the use of TCP and, in part, that of DDVP may be considered as less critical due to their hydrophilic properties and rapid degradation. In view of their lipophilic behaviour, the use of butonate, carbaryl, rafoxanide and hexachloro-p-xylene as active agents in veterinary preparations for milk cows must be regarded as problematic.
