35432958,"Decomposition in seafood products in the United States is monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) laboratories using sensory testing, which requires highly trained analysts. A large-volume headspace (LVHS) gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method was developed to generate analytical results that can be directly compared to sensory evaluation. Headspace vapor was withdrawn from a 1-L vial containing 50 g seafood sample using a large volume headspace autosampler. Various volatile compounds were collected simultaneously. Analytes were preconcentrated by a capillary column trapping system and then sent through a cryo-focuser mounted onto the GC injector. A selected ion monitoring (SIM) MS acquisition method was used to selectively monitor 38 compounds of interest. Samples of red snapper, croaker, weakfish, mahi-mahi, black tiger shrimp, yellowfin tuna, and sockeye salmon that have been assessed and scored by an FDA National Seafood Sensory Expert (NSSE) were used for method performance evaluation.

35311165,"A comprehensive lipidomic analysis of the lipids extracted from grass carp bones, black carp bones, shrimp shells, and crab shells was performed in this study. First, HPLC analysis revealed that the lipids extracted from shrimp and crab shells contained 60.65% and 77.25% of diacylglycerols, respectively. Second, GC-MS analysis identified 18 fatty acid species in the lipids extracted from fish bones and crustacean shells, in which polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were highly enriched. PUFAs were present at 45.43% in the lipids extracted from shrimp shells. Notably, the lipids extracted from shrimp and crab shells contained a considerable amount of eicosapentaenoic acids and docosahexaenoic acids. Finally, multidimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics showed that various lipids including acetyl-L-carnitine, sphingomyelin (SM), lysophosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were all identified in the lipid samples, but PC and SM were the most abundant. Specifically, the total content of PC in shrimp shells was as high as 6.145 mmol/g. More than 35 species of PC were found in all samples, which were more than other lipids.

The aim of this study was to assess the public health risk associated with exposure to pesticides (organochlorine and organophosphorus) and heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, arsenic) through the consumption of dried fish (Bombay duck, ribbon fish, silver jewfish, shrimp, Chinese promfret) in coastal districts (Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Bhola, Patuakhali, Khulna) of Bangladesh. Dried fish consumption data were collected from 500 adult respondents (100 from each district) using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Pesticide residues were determined using QuEChERS extraction coupled to gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, and heavy metals were estimated using an atomic absorption spectrophotometric method. The results revealed that the frequency and amount of dried fish consumption was highest for Bombay duck in Cox's Bazar (11.57 g/capita/day) and ribbon fish (12.10 g/capita/day) in Chittagong.

34507722,"Edible insects are considered as a promising and sustainable alternative protein source for humans, although risk assessments, with particular reference to the allergic potential of insect proteins, are required. Considering that insects are likely to be consumed after processing, it is crucial to assess how processing can influence allergenicity. In our study, we investigated how boiling and frying affect the IgE cross-recognition of proteins from five edible insects (mealworm, buffalo worm, silkworm, cricket and grasshopper). We considered three groups of Italian patients allergic to shrimps and to house dust mites, who had never consumed insects before and two subjects with occupational allergy and food sensitization to mealworm. Our data suggest that thermal processing may change the solubility of proteins, thereby resulting in a protein shift from water-soluble fractions to water-insoluble fractions. Immunoblot and LC-MS/MS analyses have shown that tropomyosin may play an important role as a cross-allergen for house dust mite and shrimp allergic patients, while larval cuticle protein seems to play a major role in the cross-reactivity of patients primarily sensitized to mealworm. On the basis of our results, the effects of processing appear to be protein-, species- and treatment-specific.

In the present study, the specific IgE (sIgE) binding characteristics of different shrimp proteins of black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) to the sera of eight shrimp-allergic patients from China were studied by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and nanoliquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. According to the PLGS scores (>2000) and the sequence coverage (>40%), eight proteins with sIgE binding activity were identified, including myosin heavy chain type 1 (K4Q4N8), hemocyanin (G1AP69 and Q95V28), phosphopyruvate hydratase (O96656), arginine kinase (C7E3T4), tropomyosin (A1KYZ2), sarcoplasmic calcium binding protein (H7CHW2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (A0A097BQP2). Among these eight proteins, phosphopyruvate hydratase was a prevalent IgE-binding protein among these Chinese patients with binding observed in 100% of sera. Moreover, 13 peptides were predicted as epitopes of phosphopyruvate hydratase.

34127378,"Approximately 6.5 million tons of shrimp are consumed annually worldwide. The price of shrimp is greatly influenced by species and habitat (e.g., farmed vs wild-caught). In recent years, false labeling has become a problem in the shrimp industry. False labeling can include species, habitat (whether farmed or wild-caught). This problem is motivated by the potential for economic benefit, and significantly reduces the consumer reliability of food. As a first step in establishing a detection method, we took a metabolomics approach to elucidate phenotypic diversity by assessing genetic differences and environmental factors. Metabolites identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis were subjected to multivariate analysis to identify metabolites that correlated with shrimp species and habitat. The characteristics based on species and habitat were observed respectively. For species, the classification approximately tended to be based on taxonomy. It suggests that species different have strong effect on metabolite profiles. In particular, the difference between Panaediae and Pandalidae was significantly observed, and some fatty acids such as palmitoleic acid and elaidic acid are abundant in Pandalidae. Among Pandalidae, Japanese tiger shrimp was characterized by metabolites related to purine metabolism. For habitat, farmed shrimp had a high amino acid content, and wild caught shrimp had a high fatty acid content. Habitat-based separation was observed in Indonesian black tiger shrimp samples, indicating that metabolites such as glycolic acid, phosphate, and pentadecanoic acid are characteristic components of natural black tiger shrimp.",Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,"['D000818', 'D017753', 'D008401', 'D055432', 'D033561', 'D015203']","['Animals', 'Ecosystem', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolomics', 'Penaeidae', 'Reproducibility of Results']",Investigation of the characteristics of different shrimps by species and habitat using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry based metabolomics.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127378,2021

We surveyed the total arsenic content and the mass fractions of hydrophilic arsenic species from five different marine food types cutting across the food chain from microalgae, macroalgae, bivalve clam, crustaceans and finfish. Total arsenic was determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) while arsenic speciation analysis was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to ICP-MS as the detector. The total arsenic contents ranged from 133 ± 11 ng/g to 26,630 ± 520 ng/g.

Moreover, the changes of flavor and key umami molecules in SH were studied by sensory evaluation, electronic tongue, electronic nose, automated amino acid analyzer, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that the significant difference of flavor in SH happened during autolysis. SH with autolysis had the best umami taste at 6 h, which may result from the synergistic work of free amino acids and nucleotide related compounds. Additionally, the performance of endogenous proteases in SH was investigated to efficiently analyze autolysis. The optimum pH and temperature of endogenous proteases in SH were 7.5 and 50 °C, respectively. The autolysis of SH depends on two endogenous proteases (~50 kDa and ~75 kDa). These results suggest that the formation of flavor in SH during autolysis can be controlled, which could provide guidance for SH recycle.

Steaming method does not yield any HAs, and the cause might be elucidate that shrimp were not directly in contact with cooking pan or fire which affect the HAs formation. Food precursors (protein, moisture, fat, creatine and glucose) were also measured in raw and cooked shrimp to investigate the influence on HAs formation.

The outcomes from this work could be applied to estimate the HAs human intake globally and add to steaming cooking method in such types of food products that diminish the risk of HAs exposure, and thus to get healthier food quality and security.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000588', 'D002273', 'D006571', 'D006801', 'D008460', 'D053719']","['Amines', 'Carcinogens', 'Heterocyclic Compounds', 'Humans', 'Meat', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Shrimp as a substantial source of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines.,"[None, 'Q000633', 'Q000633', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'toxicity', 'toxicity', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33648212,2021
33571511,"Outbreaks of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) have caused serious damage to penaeid shrimp aquaculture worldwide. Despite great efforts to characterize the virus, the conditions that lead to infection and the infection mechanisms, there is still a lack of understanding regarding these complex virus-host interactions, which is needed to develop consistent and effective treatment methods for WSSV. In this study, we used a gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics approach to compare the metabolite profiles of gills, haemolymph and hepatopancreas from whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) exposed to WSSV and corresponding controls. The results revealed clear discriminations between metabolite profiles of WSSV-challenged shrimp and controlled shrimp in each tissue. The responses of shrimp gills to WSSV infection were characterized by increases of many fatty acids and amino acids in WSSV-challenged shrimp compared to the controls. Changes in haemolymph metabolite profiles include the increased levels of itaconic acid, energy-related metabolites, metabolites in glutathione cycle and decrease of amino acids. The WSSV challenge led to the decreases of several fatty acids and amino acids and increases of other amino acids, lactic acid and other organic compounds (levulinic acid, malonic acid and putrescine) in hepatopancreas. These alterations of shrimp metabolites suggest several immune responses of shrimp to WSSV in a tissue-specific manner, including upregulation of osmoregulation, antimicrobial activity, metabolic rate, gluconeogenesis, glutathione pathway in control of oxidative stress and shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism in shrimp which indicates the Warburg effect.

33379081,"Shrimp is one of the most delicious and popular food commodities worldwide due to its exceptional taste and characteristics. Freshness is considered as a key factor for shrimp consumers because freshness has a significant relationship with taste and shelf-life of shrimp. However, post-mortem metabolism of shrimp differs from that of fish as they are highly susceptible to post-harvest quality loss, and it is hard to distinguish the freshness variation of shrimp at frozen state instantly. Thus, instant monitoring of frozen shrimp freshness is challenging for the seafood and aquaculture industries and a reliable, expeditious, and noninvasive technique to estimate shrimp quality is in high demand. Accordingly, this study aimed to visualize changes in post-mortem freshness of frozen shrimp using multidimensional fluorescence imaging. Live coonstripe shrimp (Pandalus hypsinotus) were harvested and instantly killed by beheading, cooled on ice for 0, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h (n = 8), followed by processing into frozen peeled deveined shrimp product and stored at -60 °C. 50% of frozen shrimp were analyzed for excitation-emission matrix (EEM), ATP-related compounds, and pH using a fiber optic supported fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7100), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and pH meter, respectively at each time point (n = 4). Then, fluorescence images were obtained from the remaining 50% of frozen shrimp (n = 4) by computer vision method equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, MAX-303 xenon light source for an excitation light (Ex. 330 nm), and an automatic filter changer for emission band-pass filters (Em. 380-610 nm at 10 nm intervals). Chemical analysis of frozen shrimp revealed that K-value and pH of shrimp increased from 1.61 to 66.56% and 6.49-7.31, respectively, during storage on ice. Repeated partial least squares regression (PLSR) models of EEM for K-value prediction suggested an efficient excitation wavelength (330 nm) and its corresponding emission wavelengths (380-610 nm) to produce fluorescence images. Spatial-temporal changes of K-value and pH were visualized successfully in frozen shrimp by fluorescence imaging.

(Diptera: Culicidae), Culex modestus Ficalbi (Diptera: Culicidae), and Anopheles messeae Falleroni (Diptera: Culicidae), as well as selected nontarget aquatic invertebrates, were studied under laboratory conditions. The possibility of trophic transfer of avermectins (AVMs) through the food chain and their toxic effects on predaceous species fed AIFP-treated mosquito larvae was also evaluated. Among mosquitoes, Anopheles messeae were the most sensitive to AIFP, while Cx. modestus exhibited the least sensitivity to this formulation. Among nontarget aquatic invertebrates, the greatest toxicity of AIFP was observed for benthic species (larval Chironomus sp. Meigen (Diptera: Chironomidae), whereas predators (dragonflies, water beetles, and water bugs) exhibited the lowest AIFP sensitivity. AIFP sensitivity of the clam shrimp Lynceus brachyurus O. F. Muller (Diplostraca: Lynceidae), the phantom midge Chaoborus crystallinus De Geer (Diptera: Chaoboridae), and the mayfly Caenis robusta Eaton (Ephemeroptera: Caenidae) was intermediate and similar to the sensitivity of the mosquito Cx. modestus. However, these nontarget species were more resistant than An. messeae and Ae. aegypti.

32916171,"Over the past decade, in silico genome and transcriptome mining has led to the identification of many new crustacean peptide families, including the agatoxin-like peptides (ALPs), a group named for their structural similarity to agatoxin, a spider venom component. Here, analysis of publicly accessible transcriptomes was used to expand our understanding of crustacean ALPs. Specifically, transcriptome mining was used to investigate the phylogenetic/structural conservation, tissue localization, and putative functions of ALPs in decapod species. Transcripts encoding putative ALP precursors were identified from one or more members of the Penaeoidea (penaeid shrimp), Sergestoidea (sergestid shrimps), Caridea (caridean shrimp), Astacidea (clawed lobsters and freshwater crayfish), Achelata (spiny/slipper lobsters), and Brachyura (true crabs), suggesting a broad, and perhaps ubiquitous, conservation of ALPs in decapods. Comparison of the predicted mature structures of decapod ALPs revealed high levels of amino acid conservation, including eight identically conserved cysteine residues that presumably allow for the formation of four identically positioned disulfide bridges. All decapod ALPs are predicted to have amidated carboxyl-terminals. Two isoforms of ALP appear to be present in most decapod species, one 44 amino acids long and the other 42 amino acids in length, both likely generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. In carideans, a gene or terminal exon duplication appears to have occurred, with alternative splicing producing four ALPs, two 44 and two 42 amino acid isoforms. The identification of ALP precursor-encoding transcripts in nervous system-specific transcriptomes (e.g., Homarus americanus brain, eyestalk ganglia, and cardiac ganglion assemblies, finding confirmed using RT-PCR) suggests that members of this peptide family may serve as locally-released and/or hormonally-delivered neuromodulators in decapods.

Toxic trace element exposures have been reported in association with fertility and fecundity in epidemiologic studies even at low to moderate levels. While most previous studies employed blood and urine biomarkers of exposure, few have assessed toxic trace elements in ovarian follicular fluid (FF), which surrounds the developing oocyte and hence may better reflect concentrations potentially affecting reproductive outcomes. Our objective was to identify dietary predictors of FF toxic trace elements in n = 56 women (mean age: 38.3 years) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) at the University of California at San Francisco. We determined As, Hg, Cd, and Pb in 197 FF specimens, collected on the day of oocyte retrieval, using inductively coupled plasma tandem mass spectrometry. A comprehensive food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the weekly and annual dietary ""patterns"" of participants. Consumption of specific seafood items and turkey were correlated with individual FF toxic trace elements. We also found that each unit higher seafood consumption in the past week dominated by mollusks, shrimp, and bass was associated with 60% higher FF As (95% confidence interval (CI): 25%, 105%) and FF Hg (95%CI: 7%, 136%) concentrations. Higher annual seafood consumption dominated by urchin, crab, and trout was associated with 16% higher FF As (95%CI: -2%, 38%) and 31% higher FF Hg (95%CI: 7%, 60%) concentrations per unit intake. No associations were noted between diet and Cd and Pb levels in FF. Overall, our results suggest that higher seafood consumption contributes to elevated levels of As and Hg in FF.

Though the fibrinolytic activity could vary in different kinds of Jotgal, this activity seems to be produced by microorganisms during the natural fermentation stage. From Gonjaengijot (pickled opossum shrimp), two novel fibrinolytic enzymes named by JP-I and JP-II, have been purified by ethanol precipitation, Bio-GEL P-100 gel filtration, and DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography. Compared to the crude enzyme extract, the specific activity of the JP-I and JP-II increased 258, 85-fold with the recovery of 22.1, 8.5%, respectively. The molecular weights of both enzymes were estimated as 36 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The optimal condition for fibrinolytic activity of JP-I was at 50°C and pH 8.1, while that of JP-II was at 45°C and 9.9. Both enzymes were stable at a broad range of pH (5.0 to 10.5) and have metalloprotease nature. From these results, it concludes that these enzymes could be a novel potent thrombolytic agent.

32331667,"Bacterial communities and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) profile of deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) stored at 0 °C (ice) and 4 °C were investigated using 16S amplicon based sequencing and Solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) - Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), respectively. The shelf-life of shrimps determined by sensory assessment was 5 and 2 days at 0 °C and 4 °C, respectively. Based on 16S analysis (culture-independed), the initial microbiota of shrimps mainly consists of Photobacterium, Candidatus Hepatoplasma, Psychrobacter, Acinetobacter and Delftia. Psychrobacter and Carnobacterium dominated during storage at both temperatures. Psychrobacter was the most dominant taxon at the end of shelf-life of chill-stored shrimps. A minor microbial population composed by Brevundimonas, Stenotrophomonas, Staphylococcus, Legionella, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Escherichia-Shigella, Enterococcus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella was also detected. Those taxa may be originated from the environment due to an inadequate hygienic practice during fishing, handling and icing. VOCs such as ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, indole etc., were found to be associated with shrimps at 4 °C, while acetone and dimethyl sulfide with shrimps in ice. Some VOCs, from microbial or chemical origin, increased in shrimps either at 0 °C (i.e. 1-octen-3-ol, trans-2-octenal) or at 4 °C (i.e. 3-methyl-1-butanol, indole), while 2-methylbutanal and 3-methylbutanal increased in both temperatures. A positive correlation between Psychrobacter with 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and Carnobacterium with 3-methyl-1-butanol was also observed. Concluding, we suggest the reinforcement of Good Hygiene Practices on fishing boats during fishing/handling, the rapid onboard icing and keeping shrimps iced avoiding even small increase of storage temperature that affects quality parameters (e.g. microbial population level, synthesis of microbiota, VOCs profile) in order to provide a product of the highest quality and safety in the market.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000447', 'D000818', 'D001419', 'D033364', 'D005516', 'D008401', 'D000441', 'D064307', 'D012336', 'D017747', 'D055549']","['Aldehydes', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Decapoda', 'Food Microbiology', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hexanols', 'Microbiota', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Seafood', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Microbiota and volatilome profile of fresh and chill-stored deepwater rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris).,"[None, None, 'Q000145', 'Q000382', None, None, None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'classification', 'microbiology', None, None, None, 'physiology', None, 'microbiology', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32331667,2021

However, excessive intake overwhelming bodily homoeostasis can result in phosphate toxicity such as mineral and bone disorders, associated with chronic kidney diseases, and cardiovascular events. Rapid analysis for condensed phosphates is required to detect the illegal adulteration of processed marine products. We optimised an analytical method using ion chromatography for the rapid and selective detection of condensed phosphates in various kinds of fishery and processed marine products. We compared the performance of three columns (IonPac AS11, AS11-HC, and AS16) for the detection of condensed phosphates with respect to time of analysis and sensitivity. The IonPac AS11 column exhibited the shortest retention time for the major condensed phosphates (pyro-, tri-, and trimetaphosphate), the highest sensitivity for trimetaphosphate, and good repeatability and precision. Microwave and boiling processing were examined as methods to prevent hydrolysis of condensed phosphates into orthophosphate, which is critical in distinguishing intentionally added condensed phosphates from naturally occurring orthophosphate. Microwave treatment was determined to be the more effective method to suppress hydrolysis of condensed phosphates to orthophosphate. Furthermore, microwave processing could be used for thawing the frozen samples, saving extra effort and time. We confirmed that the method exhibits good recovery (80% or more) and precision (%RSD < 10%) for samples with various matrices. With the method, 14 kinds of fishery and processed marine food products were successfully analysed for condensed phosphates. Especially, we identified that phosphate levels in the processed shrimp and dried shredded squid samples exceeded the maximum allowable levels specified in the CODEX standard.

The most common methods used for allergen detection are based on immunoassays, PCR and mass spectrometry. However, all of them are very complex and time-consuming. Herein, an aptamer biosensor for the detection of the major shrimp allergen tropomyosin (TM) was developed. Graphene oxide (GO) was used as a platform for screening of the minimal-length aptamer sequence required for high-affinity target binding. A fluorescein dye labeled GO quenches the truncated aptamer by π-stacking interactions. After the addition of TM, the fluorescence was restored due to the competitive binding of the aptamer to GO. One of the truncated aptamers was found to bind to TM with four-fold higher affinity (30 nM) compared to the full-length aptamer (124 nM), with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2 nM. The aptamer-based sensor demonstrates the sensitive, selective, and specific detection of TM in 30 min. The performance of the sensor was confirmed using TM spiked chicken soup, resulting in a high percentage recovery (~97 ± 10%).

This method has been further evaluated for its feasibility to detect several other classes of compounds that might also be a concern as possible contaminants in farmed tilapia, salmon, eel and shrimp. Some chemicals could contaminate water sources used in aquaculture production through agricultural run-off. These compounds include several widely used triazine herbicides, organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, as well as various discarded human pharmaceuticals. Other possible contaminants investigated were selected disinfectants, some newer antibiotics, growth promoters, and various parasiticides. The sample preparation consisted of an acidic acetonitrile extraction followed by solid-phase extraction clean-up. Data were collected with a quadrupole-Orbitrap MS using both non-targeted and targeted acquisition. This rapid clean-up procedure and HRMS detection method described previously for veterinary drug residues also worked well for many other types of compounds. Most analytes had screening limit levels between 0.5-10 ng/g in the matrices examined using exact mass identification criteria.

The clean-up conditions, such as the pH of the loading solution and the acetonitrile concentration in the elution and wash solvents, were optimized.

30579642,"The performance of particulate layers of a smaller particle size than given HPTLC plates was investigated. However, reducing the particle size and thus interporous space, the capillary flow is substantially reduced. For the first time, optimizations led to the successful use of a layer made of mainly 4-μm irregular silica gel particles as stationary phase in planar chromatography. Layer thicknesses of 50 and 70 μm were studied to suit especially for ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC). Along with it, the chromatographic fingerprint was miniaturized by 75%. The required development time and developing distance were reduced up to 50%. A typical 35-mm separation took less than 10 min. The limit of detection was improved by a factor of up to 3. Further chromatographic performance data, such as separation number (peak capacity), resolution and analytical response proved the suitability of the particulate UTLC layer. A direct transferability and miniaturization of established HPTLC methods to the UTLC dimension was aimed at. This was successfully demonstrated for eight quite different separations, i.e. food dyes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, steviol glycosides in cough drops and sweetener tablets, preservatives in shrimp-surimi salad, gingerol in ginger-containing products, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in honey, tanshinones in Salvia miltiorriza extracts and monacolin K in fermented red rice food supplements. The direct method transfer, mainstream usability and fast analyses at low running costs are crucial features of the developed UTLC plate.

30350607,"Growth of microorganisms is often accompanied by the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The released VOCs may qualitatively or quantitatively reflect the physiological states of microbial cultures. A number of VOCs are produced during microbial degradation of organic matter accompanying food spoilage. In order to characterize the dynamics of microbial VOC production, and enable time-dependent analysis, we have constructed a dual-chamber sampling system and coupled it online with mass spectrometry (MS). The biological specimen is placed in a gas-tight sampling chamber. A carrier gas is introduced to the chamber periodically to transfer the VOCs present in the specimen headspace to the atmospheric-pressure chemical-ionization interface of a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. A control or blank spectrum is recorded before the specimen spectrum is recorded at each time point, enabling signal comparison and subtraction. The custom-made electronic control unit, incorporating three Arduino microcontrollers, operates six pinch valves and a miniature air compressor and triggers MS-data acquisition. The automated dual-chamber sampling system was first tested using standard mixtures to verify its analytical performance. To demonstrate the usefulness of this system in the studies of microbial volatomes, we implemented it in real-time monitoring of the growth of baker's yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae), fructification of golden oyster mushroom ( Pleurotus citrinopileatus), and microbial degradation of a food-related sample (Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei).

Very little attention has been paid to the production of lysozyme as an antimicrobial enzyme. The present work represents one of the few studies reporting lysozyme production by enterococci. Indeed, this study was first conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus lactis Q1, an enterocin P-producing strain previously isolated from fresh shrimp (Penaeus vannamei), against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Results showed significant inhibitory activity (P < 0.05) towards diverse pathogens. The purification of the antimicrobial substances produced by Q1 strain leads to the isolation of two active fractions. The SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analyses of fraction number 2 (fraction 2) revealed the presence of a protein with molecular mass of 14.3 kDa. Additionally, the experimental results are consistent with mass spectra of industrial lysozyme (Fluka ref. 62970).

This study attempted to identify three related commercial shrimp species of the order Decapoda: Marsupenaeus japonicus, Fenneropenaeus chinensis, and Litopenaeus vannamei. All measurable trypsin-digested peptides in the individual shrimp were detected using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight (UPLC-Q-TOF) mass spectrometry with sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) data-independent acquisition. Further analysis of peptide biomarkers was carried out with an orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model. BLAST was used for species-specific analysis. Subsequently, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) methods were developed for sensitivity and selectivity screening of the selected peptides, and 27 were identified as biomarkers allowing rapid and accurate discrimination of shrimp species without high-resolution mass spectrometry or statistical model building.

In this study, locally harvested finfish and shrimp were collected from research participants in southeast Louisiana and analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are some of the most important chemicals of concern regarding oil-spill-contaminated seafood resources during and following oil spills. Some PAHs are considered carcinogens for risk assessment purposes, and currently, seven of these can be combined in lifetime cancer risk assessments using EPA approaches. Most PAHs were not detected in these samples (minimum detection limits ranged from 1.2 to 2.1 PPB) and of those that were detected, they were generally below 10 PPB. The pattern of detected PAHs suggested that the source of these chemicals in these seafood samples was not a result of direct contact with crude oil. Lifetime cancer risks were assessed using conservative assumptions and models in a probabilistic framework for the seven carcinogenic PAHs. Lifetime health risks modeled using this framework did not exceed a 1/10,000 cancer risk threshold. Conservative, health-protective deterministic estimates of the levels of concern for PAH chemical concentration and seafood intake rates were above the concentrations and intake rates modeled under this probabilistic framework.

29476233,"Single laboratory validation of a method for arsenic speciation analysis in seafood and seaweed is presented. The method is based on stepwise extraction of water-soluble and non-polar arsenic with hot water and a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol, respectively. While the water-soluble arsenicals were speciated by anion and cation exchange liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS), the non-polar arsenicals were collectively determined by ICP-MS after digestion in acid. The performance characteristics and broad application of the method were evaluated by analyzing eight commercial samples (cod, haddock, mackerel, crab, shrimp, geoduck clam, oyster, and kombu) and four reference materials (fish protein (DORM-4), lobster hepatopancreas (TORT-3), mussel tissue (SRM 2976), and hijiki seaweed (CRM 7405-a)) representing finfish, crustaceans, molluscs, and seaweed. Matrices spiked at three levels in duplicates were also analyzed. The stepwise extraction provided 76-106% extraction of the total arsenic from the test materials. The method demonstrated satisfactory repeatability for analysis of replicate extracts prepared over several days. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by analyzing reference materials certified for both total arsenic and a few arsenicals; the experimental results were 90-105% of the certified values. Comparison between the total water-soluble arsenic and the sum of the concentrations of the chromatographed species gave 80-92% mass balance. While spike recoveries of most arsenicals were in the acceptance range set by CODEX, a few species spiked into cod, haddock, and shrimp were poorly recovered due to transformation to other forms. After thorough investigations, strategies were devised to improve the recoveries of these species by averting their transformations.

In this study, we employed a statistical approach to determine the contribution of thujones to the overall observed behaviour-modulating and toxic effects of essential oils (Salvia officinalis L., Artemisia absinthium L., Thuja occidentalis L. and Tanacetum vulgare L.) containing these monoterpene ketones. The data from three in vivo neuropharmacological tests on rats (open field, light-dark, and diazepam-induced sleep), and toxicity assays (brine shrimp, and antimicrobial activity against a panel of microorganisms), together with the data from detailed chemical analyses, were subjected to a multivariate statistical treatment to reveal the possible correlation(s) between the content of essential-oil constituents and the observed effects. The results strongly imply that the toxic and behaviour-modulating activity of the oils (hundreds of constituents) should not be associated exclusively with thujones. The statistical analyses pinpointed to a number of essential-oil constituents other than thujones that demonstrated a clear correlation with either the toxicity, antimicrobial effect or the activity on CNS.

Among these proteins, 26 were up-regulated while 32 were down-regulated. 48 out of 58 differentially expressed proteins were annotated in the Uniprot database and were mapped into 38 pathways by KEGG analysis. These proteins were categorized into the pathways for energy metabolism, signaling, immunization and detoxification, lipid and protein metabolism. A more active glycometabolism, positive response detoxification pathway, immunosuppression and positive osmoregulation were identified in L.vannamei under low salinity stress.

This study aimed to evaluate the allergenicity of tropomyosin, a well‑established invertebrate pan‑allergen, from silkworm pupa. The silkworm tropomyosin gene was cloned by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction, and the protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography using Nickel‑resin. IgE reactivity of the recombinant protein was examined by ELISA and competitive inhibition analyses. Silkworm pupa tropomyosin shared 73.5‑92.3% amino acid sequence identity with previously identified allergenic tropomyosins. Sera from eight of 15 patients with silkworm allergy (53.3%) exhibited binding of IgE to the recombinant protein. However, recombinant protein was able to inhibit less than 10% of IgE reactivity to silkworm pupa extract. Of the eight sera tested, six that specifically reacted with silkworm tropomyosin also demonstrated IgE reactivity to shrimp and crab.

30246987,"A separation/preconcentration procedure with coprecipitation has been proposed for the flame atomic absorption spectrometric (FAAS) determination of cadmium at trace level in food and environmental samples. Manganese(Ⅱ) was used as a carrier which chelated with 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol to detect the content of trace cadmium in shrimp and shell fish samples with flame atomic absorption spectrometry for the first time. The precipitate could be easily dissolved with concentrated nitric acid. The optimum coprecipitation of this new method including the amount of reagent, amount of manganese(Ⅱ), the pH, and the standing time of the precipitate had been confirmed for the quantitative recoveries of the analytes. The effect of matrix ions and the interference of co-existing ions were also evaluated. Under the experimental conditions established by the optimization step, the system of Mn(Ⅱ)-5-Br-PADAP was able to overcome the matrix interference which showed the effect of separation and enrichment well. The linear range of cadmium content was determined to be 0.1～1.0 mg·L-1. The sensitivity and the relative standard deviation(RSD) were found 0.147(mg·L-1)-1, 0.73%, respectively. The optimum procedure allows the determination of cadmium with limit of detection of 4.27 μg·L-1. The complexity of preprocessing was determined by the complexity of food samples. So the differences of cadmium content in the samples between the direct determination with atomic absorption spectrometry and the measurement after coprecipitation were examined, which providedevidences for the superiority of the system again. Cadmium in shell fish and shrimp samples were 1.85 mg·kg-1 and 1.74 mg·kg-1, which in line with international standards of the Codex Alimentarius Commission(CAC). The credibility of the method was evaluated by standard additional method and recovery experiments. The standard addition recoveries of sample and RSDs of the method were in the range of 99.9%～100.3% and 0.15%～0.83%.

A total of 511 fish and shrimp samples were collected from markets in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Thai Binh (TB), and Nha Trang (NT) from July 2013 to October 2015. The samples were extracted with 2% formic acid in acetonitrile and washed with dispersive C18 sorbent. Thirty-two antibiotics were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Of the 362 samples from HCMC, antibiotic residues were found in 53 samples. Enrofloxacin was commonly detected, at a rate of 10.8%. In contrast, samples from TB and NT were less contaminated: only 1 of 118 analyzed samples showed residues in TB and only 1 of 31 showed residues in NT. These differences were attributed to the local manufacturing/distribution systems.

Lipopolysaccharide and β-1, 3-glucan binding protein (LGBP) as a pattern recognition protein have been demonstrated to active the proPO cascade in insect and shrimp. In this study, we investigated the role of LGBP in prophenoloxidase cascade-induced melanization in Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). By RT-PCR analysis, EsLGBP was detected in all tested tissues, and showed highest expression in hemocytes, gill, intestine and brain. The expression of EsLGBP was up-regulated in the hemocytes following injections of LPS and β-1, 3-glucan. The recombinant EsLGBP protein (rEsLGBP) was produced via prokaryotic expression system and affinity chromatography. By western blotting, rEsLGBP was discovered to exhibit the ability to bind to all tested microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and yeast (Pichia pastoris). Meanwhile we found rEsLGBP has a high binding activity towards microbial immune elicitors such as LPS and β-1, 3-glucan whereas no binding activity is detected with peptidoglycan. Moreover, the effects of RNAi-mediated blockade of EsLGBP were investigated on bacterial counts in the hemolymph and cumulative mortality rate of crabs infected with Vibrio parahaemolyticus in vivo. Further experiments demonstrate that rEsLGBP can trigger the whole hemolymph dependent melanization and stimulate to proPO cascade in vitro.

Objective The current study explores scientific validation for this traditional medication. Materials and methods We used ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazil (DPPH) assays to estimate antioxidant activity of P. guajava leaf extracts (methanol, hexane and chloroform). Antitumour and in vivo cytotoxic activities were determined using potato disc assay (PDA) and brine shrimp lethality assay, respectively. Three human carcinoma cell lines (KBM5, SCC4 and U266) were incubated with different doses (10-100 μg/mL) of extracts and the anticancer activity was estimated by MTT assay. NF-κB suppressing activity was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Chemical composition of the three extracts was identified by GC-MS. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were measured by colorimetric assays. Results and discussions The order of antioxidant activity of three extracts was methanol > chloroform > hexane. The IC50 values ranged from 22.73 to 51.65 μg/mL for KBM5; 22.82 to 70.25 μg/mL for SCC4 and 20.97 to 89.55 μg/mL for U266 cells. The hexane extract exhibited potent antitumour (IC50  value = 65.02 μg/mL) and cytotoxic (LC50  value = 32.18 μg/mL) activities. This extract also completely inhibited the TNF-α induced NF-κB activation in KBM5 cells. GC-MS results showed that pyrogallol, palmitic acid and vitamin E were the major components of methanol, chloroform and hexane extracts. We observed significant (p < 0.05) difference in total phenolic and flavonoid contents of different solvent extracts.

We evaluated the performance of a Ridascreen (R-Biopharm) ELISA kit for CAP in spiked and incurred crab and shrimp muscle at levels bracketing the minimum required performance level for analysis (0.3 ng/g). The Ridascreen ELISA kit incorporates antibody directed against CAP. Incurred CAP levels in crab and shrimp muscle were verified using LC-MS/MS. We found good repeatability (relative standard deviation) of the ELISA in spiked and incurred crab and shrimp muscle samples, with values ranging from 6.8 to 21.7%. Recoveries of CAP from tissues spiked at 0.15 to 0.60 ng/g ranged from 102 to 107%. Minimal cross-reactivity with blank crab and shrimp muscle matrix components was observed. ELISA data were highly correlated with those of LC-MS/MS for CAP in incurred muscle tissue. We believe this study to be the first evaluation of the performance and comparability of a CAP ELISA kit and LC-MS/MS for determination of CAP residues, as well as their elimination, in crab muscle.

In co-culture at 26 °C, L. monocytogenes was reduced by 3-4 log CFU g(-1) after 24 h. We have demonstrated that the inhibition was not due to secretion of extracellular antimicrobial compounds as bacteriocins, organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. Global metabolomic fingerprints of these strains in pure culture were assessed by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry. Consumption of glucose, amino-acids, vitamins, nitrogen bases, iron and magnesium was measured and competition for some molecules could be hypothesized. However, after 24 h of co-culture, when inhibition of L. monocytogenes occurred, supplementation of the medium with these compounds did not restore its growth. The inhibition was observed in co-culture but not in diffusion chamber when species were separated by a filter membrane.

26522591,"Tropomyosin is a pan-allergen that shares a high homology among species. It is involved in cross-reactivity among mites, crustaceans, mollusks and insects. The objectives were to express and purify recombinant tropomyosin from the storage mite Chortoglyphus arcuatus, and to investigate the homology and cross-reactivity with tropomyosin from other invertebrates. Recombinant C. arcuatus tropomyosin (r-Cho a 10) was selected from a library by screening with a pool of patient sera. r-Cho a 10 (UniProt: H2DFL1) was sequenced, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by ion exchange and affinity chromatography. Polyclonal anti-tropomyosin antibodies were produced in mice. IgE recognition of r-Cho a 10 was checked by immunoblot. Immunoblot inhibition assays were used to identify the native tropomyosin in the complete extract from C. arcuatus and study cross-reactivity between r-Cho a 10 and Der p 10. Identification of tropomyosin in other allergenic sources was performed by immunoblot. r-Cho a 10 showed a high homology (54-96%) with other tropomyosins from different allergenic sources. IgE recognition was observed using a pool of sera from sensitized individuals. Tropomyosins from different extracts were identified not only in the whole C. arcuatus extract but also in Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, shrimp, mussel, cockroach and Anisakis extracts with polyclonal α-Cho a 10. r-Cho a 10 completely inhibited the recognition of Der p 10. Recombinant C. arcuatus tropomyosin maintained its capacity to recognize IgE. r-Cho a 10 was used to prove cross-reactivity among tropomyosins from other invertebrate species, including mites.

26475295,"The shrimp Rimicaris exoculata is the most abundant species in hydrothermal vents. Lipids, the component of membranes, play an important role in maintaining their function normally in such extreme environments. In order to understand the lipid adaptation of R. exoculata (HV shrimp) to hydrothermal vents, we compared its lipid profile with the coastal shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (EZ shrimp) which lives in the euphotic zone, using ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. As a result, the following lipid adaptation can be observed. (1) The proportion of 16:1 and 18:1, and non-methylene interrupted fatty acid (48.9 and 6.2 %) in HV shrimp was higher than that in EZ shrimp (12.7 and 0 %). While highly-unsaturated fatty acids were only present in the EZ shrimp. (2) Ceramide and sphingomyelin in the HV shrimp were enriched in d14:1 long chain base (96.5 and 100 %) and unsaturated fatty acids (67.1 and 57.7 %). While in the EZ shrimp, ceramide and sphingomyelin had the tendency to contain d16:1 long chain base (68.7 and 75 %) and saturated fatty acids (100 and 100 %). (3) Triacylglycerol content (1.998 ± 0.005 nmol/mg) in the HV shrimp was higher than that in the EZ shrimp (0.092 ± 0.005 nmol/mg). (4) Phosphatidylinositol and diacylglycerol containing highly-unsaturated fatty acids were absent from the HV shrimp. (5) Lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine were rarely detected in the HV shrimp. A possible reason for such differences was the result of food resources and inhabiting environments.

Using 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde (NF) as marker metabolite, following pre-column derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis in negative electrospray ionization mode enabled confirmation of NFZ residues in deliberately treated whole crab, crab meat and shrimp meat, with a limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) below 1 ng g(-1). Meanwhile, the derivatives of DNPH-NF were synthesized for the first time, purified by preparative liquid chromatography and structure characterized with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR). The purity of derivative was checked by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tunable ultraviolet (UPLC-TUV), and the contents were beyond 99.9%.

26393239,"Astaxanthin (ASTX) is a keto carotenoid, which possesses a non-polar linear central conjugated chain and polar β-ionone rings with ketone and hydroxyl groups at the extreme ends. It is well known as a super anti-oxidant, and recent clinical studies have established its nutritional benefits. Although it occurs in several forms, including free molecule, crystalline, aggregates and various geometrical isomers, in nature it exists primarily in the form of esters. Marine animals accumulate ASTX from primary sources such as algae. Nordic shrimps (P. borealis), which are harvested widely in the Atlantic Ocean, form a major source of astaxanthin esters. ""Astaxanthin-rich shrimp oil"" was developed as a novel product in a shrimp processing plant in Eastern Canada. A compositional analysis of the shrimp oil was performed, with a view to possibly use it as a nutraceutical product for humans and animals. Astaxanthin-rich shrimp oil contains 50% MUFAs and 22% PUFAs, of which 20% are omega-3. In addition, the shrimp oil contains interesting amounts of EPA and DHA, with 10%/w and 8%/w, respectively. Astaxanthin concentrations varied between 400 and 1000 ppm, depending on the harvesting season of the shrimp. Astaxanthin and its esters were isolated from the oil and analysed by NMR, FTIR and Micro-Raman spectroscopy. Astaxanthin mono- and diesters were synthesized and used as standards for the analysis of astaxanthin-rich shrimp oil. NMR and vibrational spectroscopy techniques were successfully used for the rapid characterization of monoesters and diesters of astaxanthin. Raman spectroscopy provided important intermolecular interactions present in the esterified forms of astaxanthin molecules. Also discussed in this paper is the use of NMR, FTIR and Micro-Raman spectroscopy for the detection of astaxanthin esters in shrimp oil.

26378579,"A method that uses mass spectrometry (MS) for identification and quantification of protein toxins, staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B (SEA and SEB), in milk and shrimp is described. The analysis was performed using a tryptic peptide, from each of the toxins, as the target analyte together with the corresponding (13)C-labeled synthetic internal standard peptide. The performance of the method was evaluated by analyzing spiked samples in the quantification range 2.5-30 ng/g (R² = 0.92-0.99). The limit of quantification (LOQ) in milk and the limit of detection (LOD) in shrimp was 2.5 ng/g, for both SEA and SEB toxins. The in-house reproducibility (RSD) was 8%-30% and 5%-41% at different concentrations for milk and shrimp, respectively. The method was compared to the ELISA method, used at the EU-RL (France), for milk samples spiked with SEA at low levels, in the quantification range of 2.5 to 5 ng/g. The comparison showed good coherence for the two methods: 2.9 (MS)/1.8 (ELISA) and 3.6 (MS)/3.8 (ELISA) ng/g. The major advantage of the developed method is that it allows direct confirmation of the molecular identity and quantitative analysis of SEA and SEB at low nanogram levels using a label and antibody free approach.

Specific antibody against V. parahaemolyticus was used as test line by coating onto the nitrocellulose membrane. Magnetic nanoprobe was prepared by immobilizing the specific antibody onto the surface of superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Specificity and sensitivity of the MNP/ICTS system were verified by artificially contaminated shrimp homogenate samples. Reliability and application feasibility of the MNP/ICTS system were demonstrated by using seafood samples (n=36). Comparing with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and traditional culture methods, the MNP/ICTS system is found to be not only a rapid qualitative analysis (~10 min), but also an accurately quantitative detection platform. Through its rapid magnetic separation property, the MNP/ICTS system is capable to flexibly combine with a sample enrichment and pre-incubation process. This combination makes the qualitative sensitivity for the food samples surged more than 100-fold. A naked-eye observation of 1.58×10(2) CFU/g V. parahaemolyticus was realized. This sensitivity could meet the V. parahaemolyticus test threshold value in many countries. Also, the total sample pre-treatment plus MNP/ICTS assay only needs about 4.5h.

The extraction steps following the overnight hydrolysis and derivatization are simpler than the conventional ethyl acetate extraction method. The main steps are neutralization of hydrolysates, addition of acetonitrile for extraction, and salting out of organic phase from the acetonitrile-aqueous mixture. Extracts are analyzed for chloramphenicol and nitrofuran metabolites by LC-MS/MS in a single injection with polarity switching between the positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode for the nitrofurans and the negative ESI mode for chloramphenicol. Recoveries calculated using an extracted matrix calibration curve and labeled internal standards for chloramphenicol and nitrofurans ranged from 98.6 to 109.2% with RSDs less than 18%.

25996815,"A method for the determination of total mercury in fresh fish and shrimp samples by solid sampling thermal decomposition/amalgamation atomic absorption spectrometry (TDA AAS) has been validated following international foodstuff protocols in order to fulfill the Brazilian National Residue Control Plan. The experimental parameters have been previously studied and optimized according to specific legislation on validation and inorganic contaminants in foodstuff. Linearity, sensitivity, specificity, detection and quantification limits, precision (repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility), robustness as well as accuracy of the method have been evaluated. Linearity of response was satisfactory for the two range concentrations available on the TDA AAS equipment, between approximately 25.0 and 200.0 μg kg(-1) (square regression) and 250.0 and 2000.0 μg kg(-1) (linear regression) of mercury. The residues for both ranges were homoscedastic and independent, with normal distribution. Correlation coefficients obtained for these ranges were higher than 0.995. Limits of quantification (LOQ) and of detection of the method (LDM), based on signal standard deviation (SD) for a low-in-mercury sample, were 3.0 and 1.0 μg kg(-1), respectively. Repeatability of the method was better than 4%. Within-laboratory reproducibility achieved a relative SD better than 6%. Robustness of the current method was evaluated and pointed sample mass as a significant factor. Accuracy (assessed as the analyte recovery) was calculated on basis of the repeatability, and ranged from 89% to 99%. The obtained results showed the suitability of the present method for direct mercury measurement in fresh fish and shrimp samples and the importance of monitoring the analysis conditions for food control purposes.

25905756,"A collaborative study was conducted to determine selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their relevant alkyl homologs in seafood matrixes using a fast sample preparation method followed by analysis with GC/MS. The sample preparation method involves addition of (13)C-PAH surrogate mixture to homogenized samples and extraction by shaking with a water-ethyl acetate mixture. After phase separation induced by addition of anhydrous magnesium sulfate-sodium chloride (2 + 1, w/w) and centrifugation, an aliquot of the ethyl acetate layer is evaporated, reconstituted in hexane, and cleaned up using silica gel SPE. The analytes are eluted with hexane-dichloromethane (3 + 1, v/v), the clean extract is carefully evaporated, reconstituted in isooctane, and analyzed by GC/MS. To allow for the use of various GC/MS instruments, GC columns, silica SPE cartridges, and evaporation techniques and equipment, performance-based criteria were developed and implemented in the qualification phase of the collaborative study. These criteria helped laboratories optimize their GC/MS, SPE cleanup, and evaporation conditions; check and eliminate potential PAH contamination in their reagent blanks; and become familiar with the method procedure. Ten laboratories from five countries qualified and completed the collaborative study, which was conducted on three seafood matrixes (mussel, oyster, and shrimp) fortified with 19 selected PAH analytes at five different levels of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) ranging from 2 to 50 μg/kg. Each matrix had a varying mixture of three different BaP levels. The other studied PAHs were at varying levels from 2 to 250 μg/kg to mimic typical PAH patterns. The fortified analytes in three matrixes were analyzed as blind duplicates at each level of BaP and corresponding other PAH levels. In addition, a blank with no added PAHs for each matrix was analyzed singly. Eight to 10 valid results were obtained for the majority of determinations. Mean recoveries of all tested analytes at the five different concentration levels were all in the range of 70-120%: 83.8-115% in shrimp, 77.3-107% in mussel, and 71.6-94.6% in oyster, except for a slightly lower mean recovery of 68.6% for benzo[ a ]anthracene fortified at 25 μg/kg in oyster (RSDr: 5.84%, RSDR: 21.1%) and lower mean recoveries for anthracene (Ant) and BaP in oyster at all three fortification levels (50.3-56.5% and 48.2-49.7%, respectively). The lower mean recoveries of Ant and BaP were linked to degradation of these analytes in oyster samples stored at -20°C, which also resulted in lower reproducibility (RSDR values in the range of 44.5-64.7% for Ant and 40.6-43.5% for BaP). However, the repeatability was good (RSDr of 8.78-9.96% for Ant and 6.43-11.9% for BaP), and the HorRat values were acceptable (1.56-1.94 for Ant and 1.10-1.45 for BaP). In all other cases, repeatability, reproducibility, and HorRat values were as follows: shrimp: RSDr 1.40-26.9%, RSDR 5.41-29.4%, HorRat: 0.22-1.34; mussel: RSDr 2.52-17.1%, RSDR 4.19-32.5%, HorRat: 0.17-1.13; and oyster: RSDr 3.12-22.7%, RSDR 8.41-31.8%, HorRat: 0.34-1.39.

25889258,"In this study, a novel electrochemical rat basophilic leukemia cell (RBL-2H3) cell sensor, based on fluorescent magnetic beads, has been developed for the detection and evaluation of different allergens in foodstuffs. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was successfully fused inside the SiO2 layer of SiO2 shell-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which was superior to the traditional Fe3O4@SiO2@FITC modification process. The as-synthesized fluorescent magnetic beads were then encapsulated with lipidosome to form cationic magnetic fluorescent nanoparticles (CMFNPs) for mast cell magnetofection. The CMFNPs were then characterized by SEM, TEM, VSM, FTIR, and XRD analyses, and transfected into RBL-2H3 cells through a highly efficient, lipid-mediated magnetofection procedure. Magnetic glassy carbon electrode (MGCE), which possesses excellent reproducibility and regeneration qualities, was then employed to adsorb the CMFNP-transfected RBL-2H3 cells activated by an allergen antigen for electrochemical assay. Results show that the exposure of model antigen-dinitrophenol-bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) to anti-DNP IgE-sensitized mast cells induced a robust and long-lasting electrochemical impedance signal in a dose-dependent manner.

25796529,"A headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) method is described, to screen seafood for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with petrochemical taint. VOCs are extracted from the headspace of heated sample homogenates by adsorption onto a SPME fiber and desorbed for analysis by GC-MS. Targeted compounds are determined semi-quantitatively using representative calibration standards for the various classes (alkanes, alkylbenzenes, indanes/tetralins, and naphthalenes) of VOCs analyzed. Sample preparation is minimal, and the analyses are rapid and automated with a capacity of 50 samples per day. The method was optimized in terms of headspace temperature, sample heating time, extraction time, and desorption time using oyster samples fortified with target compounds. Calibrations for hydrocarbon components were linear in the range of 8.3-167 ng/g; the limit of detection ranged between 0.05 and 0.21 ng/g, and the limit of quantitation between 0.16 and 0.69 ng/g. Good precision (RSD < 10 % at 16.7 ng/g for individual VOCs) and accuracy (recovery range 89-118 % at 25 ng/g) were obtained in oyster, crab, shrimp, and finfish matrices. The trueness of the method was demonstrated by quantifying VOCs at 1-2-ppb levels in oyster fortified with certified reference material NIST SRM 1491a.

The ratios of phenanthrene to anthracene (Ph/An), fluoranthene to pyrene (Flu/Pyr), and low molecular weight to high molecular weight (LMW/HMW) in sediment indicated that the sources of the PAHs were a mixture of pyrolytic and petrogenic contamination at most sampling sites in Nansi Lake. The composition profile of PAHs in plants was similar to that in water and animals with 2-3 ring PAHs being dominant. The 4-6 ring PAHs were the dominant PAH compounds in sediment. There is a positive correlation between sediment and aquatic plants, but their PAH composition profiles were different, implying that aquatic plant absorption of PAHs from sediment is selective and the accumulation of PAHs in aquatic plants is different. The concentration of PAHs in fish showed a positive correlation with plants, reflecting that the PAHs in fish are mainly absorbed from aquatic plants rather than directly from the water. Bioaccumulation of LMW PAHs in aquatic biota was higher than HMW PAHs. The biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) values of total PAHs in the plants Potamogeton lucens Linn and Ceratophyllum demersum Linn were higher than that in most animals. The BSAF values of total PAHs in animals were in the following order: Cyprinus carpio>Macrobrachium nipponense>Carassius auratus>Channa argus.

25757428,"The red color of processed shrimp, one of the most attractive attributes and an important criterion for consumers, is often limited by thermal processing (microwaving, boiling and frying), due to astaxanthin degradation. The effect of thermal processing on astaxanthin in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were investigated. A High-performance liquid chromatographic - atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (LC-(APCI)-MS/MS) method was used to identify and quantify all-trans- and cis-isomers of astaxanthin, and molecular species of astaxanthin esters in fresh and thermal processed shrimps. Total astaxanthin loss ranged from 7.99% to 52.01% in first 3 min under three thermal processing. All-trans-astaxanthin was most affected, with a reduction from 32.81 to 8.72 μg kg(-1), while 13-cis-astxanthin had a rise (from 2.38 to 4.58 μg kg(-1)). Esterified astaxanthin was shown to hydrolyze and degrade, furthermore astaxanthin diesters had a better thermostability compare to astaxanthin monoesters. Astaxanthin monoesters with eicosapntemacnioc acid (EPA, C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6), had a lower thermal stability than those with saturated fatty acids, however, it was the opposite of astaxanthin diesters. The findings suggested that the method of thermal processing should be carefully used in the manufacturing and domestic cooking of shrimps. The results also could be useful in calculating the dietary intake of astaxanthin and in assessing astaxanthin profiles and contents of shrimp containing products.

In addition, C. palmula oysters were sampled at 9 sites from the same mangrove roots where C. corteziensis oysters were collected. Metal analyses were performed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Cd, Cu, and Zn), graphite furnace (Pb), and cold vapor detection (Hg). The obtained mean levels were (µg g(-1) dry weight) as follows: Cd 6.05 ± 2.77, Cu 60.0 ± 33.4, Hg 0.38 ± 0.17, Pb 1.11 ± 0.63, and Zn 777 ± 528 µg g(-1). For all metals except Hg, the concentrations were greater during dry season than during rainy seasons. The high levels, particularly that for Cd, were related to upwelling along the eastern Gulf of California. High Hg levels in the rainy season were associated with the transport of materials from the watershed to the lagoon. Shrimp farming, agriculture, and other sources were considered as potential sources to explain the differences in metal bioavailability in the 8 lagoons. The mean concentrations of Cd (Santa María-La Reforma lagoon), Cu [San Ignacio-Navachiste-El Macapule (SINM), Urías (URI), and Altata-Ensenada del Pabellón lagoons], and zinc (Zn) (URI, Santa María-Ohuira-Topolobampo, El Colorado, and SINM lagoons) during the dry season were greater than the maximum permissible limits. C. palmula collected in 8 sites where they were present simultaneously with C. corteziensis had consistently greater metal levels than C. corteziensis, but correlation analyses showed a high and significant (P < 0.05) correlation between metal concentrations in both species.

Autoinducer-2, rather than any AHL, was detected in extracts from pure cultures of the specific spoilage organisms (SSO), i.e., Shewanella putrefaciens (SS01) and Shewanella baltica (SA02). As for the cyclic peptides, only SA02 was determined to produce cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Leu). According to the transcription levels of LuxR (the master quorum-sensing regulator) in the SSO in response to exogenous autoinducers, the SSO could sense AHLs and cyclo-(L-Leu-L-Leu), rather than autoinducer-2, cyclo-(L-Leu-L-Leu) and cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Phe). In accordance with the results of LuxR expression, the production of biofilm matrixes and extracellular proteases in the SSO was regulated by exogenous AHLs and cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Leu), rather than 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (the autoinducer-2 precursor), cyclo-(L-Leu-L-Leu) and cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Phe). Exogenous N-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone and cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Leu) increased the growth rates and population percentages of the SSO in shrimp samples under refrigerated storage, and interestingly, exogenous 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione also increased the population percentages of the SSO in vivo by inhibiting the growth of the competing bacteria.

24582392,"Recent studies have shown a decrease in the concentration of pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PCPs) in water after treatment. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that these compounds may adhere to the sludge; however, investigation of these compounds in drinking water treatment sludge has been scarce. The sludge generated by drinking water treatment plants during flocculation and decantation steps should get some special attention not only because it has been classified as non-inert waste but also because it is a very complex matrix, consisting essentially of inorganic (sand, argil and silt) and organic (humic substances) compounds. In the first step of this study, three QuEChERS methods were used, and then compared, for the extraction of pesticides (atrazine, simazine, clomazone and tebuconazole), pharmaceuticals (amitriptyline, caffeine, diclofenac and ibuprofen) and PCPs (methylparaben, propylparaben, triclocarban and bisphenol A) from drinking water treatment sludge. Afterwards, the study of different sorbents in the dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) step was evaluated. Finally, a new QuEChERS method employing chitin, obtained from shrimp shell waste, was performed in the d-SPE step. After having been optimized, the method showed limits of quantification (LOQ) between 1 and 50 μg kg(-1) and the analytical curves showed r values higher than 0.98, when liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was employed. Recoveries ranged between 50 and 120% with RSD≤15%. The matrix effect was evaluated and compensated with matrix-matched calibration.

24479629,"Aquilaria subintegra, locally known as ""Gaharu"", belongs to the Thymelaeceae family. This plant's leaves have been claimed to be effective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by Malay traditional practitioner in Malaysia. In this research, the chloroform extracts of the leaves and stem of A. subintegra were tested for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity. The Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) results indicated the presence of phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids compounds in the extracts. Analysis of the stem chloroform extracts with LCMS/MS displayed that it contains kaempferol 3,4,7-trimethyl ether. The AChE inhibitory activity of leaves and stem chloroform extracts and kaempferol were 80%, 93% and 85.8%, respectively. The Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay (BSLA) exhibited low to moderate toxicity of the chloroform extract from leaves (LC50=531.18 ± 49.53 μg/ml), the stem chloroform extract (LC50=407.34 ± 68.05 μg/ml) and kaempferol (LC50=762.41 ± 45.09 μg/ml). The extracts and kaempferol were not cytotoxic to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human normal gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1) and human normal hepatic cell line (WRL-68). The effect of leaf and stem chloroform extracts and kaempferol were determined in the Radial Arm Maze (RAM) after administration by oral gavage to ICR male and female mice with valium-impaired memory. Administration of kaempferol to the mice significantly reduced the number of repeated entries into the arms of maze in males and females. In conclusion, the inhibition of AChE by leaf and stem chloroform extracts of A. subintegra could be due to the presence of kaempferol. This extract is safe for use as a natural AChE inhibitor as an alternative to berberine for the treatment of AD.

No significant differences were observed in pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbutiric acid (TBA) and K value as well as the contents of moisture, crude protein, crude fat and ash between groups of T-1 and T-2. However, significantly higher springiness and chewiness (P<0.05) were observed in T-1 as compared to those of T-2. As for the result of total viable counts (TVC), significantly lower value (P<0.05) was shown in T-1 than that of T-2, indicating that the quality and shelf life of whiteleg shrimp killed by ice water immersion could be improved and prolonged. Furthermore, all the samples were successfully divided into two categories regarding the two slaughter methods by principal component analysis (PCA) according to the infrared spectra. By analysis of the regression coefficients of PLS-DA, it can be supposed that the quality differences of whiteleg shrimp with different slaughter processing are largely caused by structural changes of their protein and fat.

24291268,"Using N-acetyl-L-cysteine as a stabilizer, well water-dispersed, high-quality and stable CdHgSe quantum dots were facilely synthesized via a simple aqueous phase method. The as-prepared N-acetyl-L-cysteine capped CdHgSe quantum dots were thoroughly characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy and FTIR. A fluorescent sensor for selective determination of copper ions was developed using N-acetyl-L-cysteine capped CdHgSe quantum dots as fluorescent probe. The fluorescence intensity of N-acetyl-L-cysteine capped CdHgSe quantum dots decreased when interacted with copper ions due to the formation of coordination complex and aggregates. The method possesses high selectivity and is not influenced by some potential interferences such as Ag(+), Zn(2+), Co(2+) and Ni(2+). Under the optimal conditions, the change of fluorescence intensity (ΔI) was linearly proportional to the concentration of copper ions in the range of 1.0×10(-9)-4.0×10(-7) mol L(-1), with a detection limit as low as 2.0×10(-10) mol L(-1) (S/N=3).

However, very little is known about the trophic ecology of this mysid in invaded ecosystems, in particular the relative degree of herbivory, carnivory and detritivory of this potentially omnivorous species and where it derives its energy, i.e. via carbon fixed by algae inhabiting benthic or pelagic habitats or through allochthonous inputs. Here, we investigate the trophic ecology of L. benedeni in a recently established population in North-Western Germany using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. Our results suggest that in contrast to its previous classifications as a benthic or bentho-pelagic herbivore, L. benedeni is an omnivorous species, which can derive the bulk of its carbon from pelagic resources. Its trophic niche in different invaded ecosystems will be determined by multiple, system-dependent factors which have to be considered in order to predict the mysids' invasion potential.

Psychrobacter and Pseudoalteromonas species dominate the microbiota of cooked brown shrimp (Crangon crangon). Additionally, API ZYM analyses determined the species' enzymatic capacity to contribute to spoilage by degrading lipids, amino acids and proteins. The bacterial species used in this study were isolated from cooked brown shrimp during storage under different storage and processing conditions and were selected for analysis of their spoilage potential based on their difference in the (GTG)₅-rep profile, 16S rRNA and gyrB sequences and API ZYM profile. The isolates were inoculated as pure cultures on heat-sterilised shrimp. The inoculated samples were stored at 4 °C and the production of VOCs by the pure strains on the shrimp matrix was identified via gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). VOC production was quantified daily by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) until the bacterial count exceeded 10⁸-10⁹ cfu/g. The sensory profile of Psychrobacter species revealed very low spoilage potential as measured by the production of VOCs, but these species may nevertheless contribute to spoilage. Based on the API ZYM results, Pseudoalteromonas as well as Psychrobacter species might enhance spoilage by breaking down lipids and hydrolysing amino acids and proteins. Pseudoalteromonas species, especially Psa. elyakovii and Psa. nigrifaciens, have a high spoilage potential and might be responsible for the off-odours produced during spoilage of brown shrimp.

24041842,"Cathepsin B is a unique member of the cathepsin superfamily, which acts as both an endopeptidase and peptidyl-dipeptidase. To obtain a better understanding of this enzyme, we cloned a cDNA encoding cathepsin B from the muscle of Fenneropenaeus chinensis (FcCB). FcCB contained a 996-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 331 amino acid residues with a putative signal peptide and a propeptide_C1 at the N-terminal, a glutamine oxyanion hole and active site cysteine, histidine and asparagine residues. A region from residue 79 to 327 conferred the peptidase activity of FcCB. Pair-wise and multiple sequence alignment with 17 other organisms, including ten different vertebrate species, five different invertebrate species and two different plant species, indicated that the signal peptide and the propeptide_C1 at the N-terminal of FcCB were less conserved than the mature protein, except when compared with Penaeus monodon, Litopenaeus vannamei and Marsupenaeus japonicas, all of which belong to the genus Penaeus. The expression of FcCB in the hepatopancreas was higher than that in the gill. The expression of FcCB in the gill was higher than that in the muscle. A challenge test was performed to reveal the responses of FcCB in different tissues to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection, which causes serious economic losses in the shrimp farming industry. The FcCB gene expressions in the ectoderm, mesoderm and entoderm were not the same prior to WSSV infection, but at 6 h after WSSV challenge, the FcCB expression in the gill, hepatopancreas and muscle was up-regulated, suggesting that FcCB might be involved in the immune response to WSSV. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the FcCB gene, involving C/T transitions, which are known as mutation hot spots. Notably, the three SNPs constituted a haplotype that can be used as an indicator of the haplotype block. The SNP genotypes of two groups of shrimps, respectively comprising 96 WSSV-resistant shrimps and 96 WSSV-susceptible shrimps, were obtained using a high-resolution melting (HRM) method. Associated factors, including observed heterozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (He), minor allele frequency (MAF) and P-values for the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), were obtained. For the association analysis with WSSV resistance, the P-values were calculated using Pearson's chi-square test. In the two groups, the MAFs of all sites were greater than 0.05, and no site departed significantly (P < 0.05) from HWE. The genotype distribution of the C-984T mutation site between the two groups was not significantly different.

Hence, it is vital to evaluate the content of possible contamination of these marine-foods. Six species of fishes and two species of shrimps were collected from the local markets of Mashhad, Iran. The mercury (Hg) concentration of samples was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a mercuric hydride system (MHS 10). High concentration of total Hg was found in Clupeonella cultriventris caspia (0.93 ± 0.14 μg/g) while the lowest level was detected in Penaeus indicus (0.37 ± 0.03 μg/g). Mean Hg levels in fish and shrimp samples were 0.77 ± 0.08 μg/g and 0.51 ± 0.05 μg/g, respectively. Farmed species (except for P. indicus) and all samples from Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea had mean mercury concentrations above 0.5 μg/g, which is the maximum standard level recommended by Joint FAO/WHO/Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). All samples had also mean Hg concentrations that exceeded EPA's established safety level of 0.3 μg/g. A little more extensive analysis of data showed that weekly intake of mercury for the proportion of the Iranian population consuming Hg contaminated fish and shrimp is not predicted to exceed the respective provisional tolerable weekly intakes recommended by JECFA.

23338600,"Haemocyanin (Hc) is a copper-containing respiratory protein, floating freely dissolved in the hemolymph of many arthropod species. A typical haemocyanin is a hexamer or oligohexamer of six identical or similar subunits, with a molecular mass around 75 kDa each. In the crustaceans, the haemocyanins appear to be restricted to the remipedes and the malacostracans. We have investigated the haemocyanins of two freshwater shrimps, the Amano shrimp Caridina multidentata and the bamboo shrimp Atyopsis moluccensis. We obtained three full-length and one partial cDNA sequences of haemocyanin subunits from the Amano shrimp, which were assigned to the α- and γ-types of decapod haemocyanin subunits. Three complete and two partial haemocyanin cDNA sequences were obtained from the bamboo shrimp, which represent subunit types α, β and γ. This is the first time that sequences of all three subunit types of the decapod haemocyanins were obtained from a single species. However, mass spectrometry analyses identified only α- and γ-type subunits, suggesting that a β-subunit is not a major component of the native haemocyanin of the bamboo shrimp. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses showed that malacostracan haemocyanins commenced to diversify into distinct subunit types already ~515 million years ago. β-subunits diverged first, followed by α- and γ-type subunits ~396 million years ago. The haemocyanins of phyllocarids and peracarids form distinct clades within the α/γ-cluster. Within the Caridea, an early divergence of distinct α-type subunits occurred ~200 MYA.

23337109,"The cellular signal-transduction process is largely controlled by protein phosphorylation. Shrimp infected with yellow head virus show dramatic changes in their hemocyte phosphoproteomic patterns, and aberrant activation of phosphorylation-based signaling networks has been implicated in a number of diseases. In this study, we focused on phosphorylation of Penaeus monodon myosin regulatory light chain (PmMRLC) that is induced at an early hour post YHV infection and is concomitant with cellular actin remodeling. In shrimp cell cultures, this phosphorylation was inhibited by the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibitors ML-7 and ML-9, suggesting that PmMLC phosphorylation is MLCK pathway-dependent. Blocking PmMRLC phosphorylation resulted in increased replication of YHV and reduction of phagocytic activities of shrimp hemocytes called semigranular cells (SGC) and granular cells (GC). Injection of MLCK inhibitors prior to YHV challenge resulted in dose-dependent elevation in quantity of YHV-positive GC and cytoplasmic YHV protein, coincident with high shrimp mortality. Altogether, we demonstrated that PmMRLC phosphorylation increases after YHV infection in shrimp and that inhibition of the phosphorylation leads to increased YHV replication, reduced hemocyte phagocytic activity (probably through actin remodeling) and subsequent shrimp death. Thus, further studies on the MLCK activation pathway may lead to new strategies in development and implementation of therapy for YHV infections in shrimp.",Fish & shellfish immunology,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D015153', 'D002853', 'D003001', 'D018076', 'D015180', 'D005455', 'D006434', 'D008969', 'D018994', 'D033561', 'D010750', 'D010766', 'D010802', 'D020543', 'D012333', 'D046828', 'D016415', 'D017422', 'D053719']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hemocytes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myosin Light Chains', 'Penaeidae', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phylogeny', 'Proteome', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Roniviridae', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Phosphorylation is required for myosin regulatory light chain (PmMRLC) to control yellow head virus infection in shrimp hemocytes.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000235', 'Q000276', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'genetics', 'immunology', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23337109,2013

The application for real samples like fish material was also studied. In addition the gas chromatographic separation and resolution was optimized and experiments were carried out to determine the highest derivatization rates. Derivatization reagents were evaluated in terms of quantity and stability of the formed chemical species. All derivatization products were characterized by mass spectrometry in order to identify the separated arsenic species. The most efficient conversion of DMA and MMA was observed by using ethylthioglycolate as derivatization agent.

22631029,"1. Because stable isotope distributions in organic material vary systematically across energy gradients that exist in ecosystems, community and population structures, and in individual physiological systems, isotope values in animal tissues have helped address a broad range of questions in animal ecology. It follows that every tissue sample provides an isotopic profile that can be used to study dietary or movement histories of individual animals. Interpretations of these profiles depend on the assumption that metabolic pools are isotopically well mixed and in equilibrium with dietary resources prior to tissue synthesis, and they extend to the population level by assuming isotope profiles are identically distributed for animals using the same proximal dietary resource. As these assumptions are never fully met, studying structure in the variance of tissue isotope values from wild populations is informative. 2. We studied variation in δ(13) C, δ(15) N, δ(2) H and δ(18) O data for feathers from a population of eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) that migrate to Great Salt Lake each fall to moult feathers. During this time, they cannot fly and feed almost exclusively on superabundant brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana). The ecological simplicity of this situation minimized the usual spatial and trophic complexities often present in natural studies of feather isotope values. 3. Ranges and variances of isotope values for the feathers were larger than those from previously published studies that report feather isotopic variance, but they were bimodally distributed in all isotope dimensions. Isotope values for proximal dietary resources and local surface water show that some of the feathers we assumed to have been grown locally must have been grown before birds reached isotopic equilibrium with local diet or immediately prior to arrival at Great Salt Lake. 4. Our study provides novel insights about resource use strategies in eared grebes during migration. More generally, it demonstrates the utility of studying variance structures and questioning assumptions implicit in the interpretation of stable isotope data from wild animals.",The Journal of animal ecology,"['D025041', 'D000818', 'D001156', 'D001717', 'D002247', 'D003903', 'D004032', 'D004175', 'D005241', 'D005260', 'D020387', 'D060106', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D018978', 'D015999', 'D009587', 'D010103', 'D013045', 'D014589']","['Animal Migration', 'Animals', 'Artemia', 'Birds', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Deuterium', 'Diet', 'Diptera', 'Feathers', 'Female', 'Food Chain', 'Lakes', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molting', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nitrogen Isotopes', 'Oxygen Isotopes', 'Species Specificity', 'Utah']",The early bird gets the shrimp: confronting assumptions of isotopic equilibrium and homogeneity in a wild bird population.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000254', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'growth & development', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22631029,2013

Our objective was to compare Pb and mercury (Hg) levels in biota and public perceptions of exposure at the Superfund and reference sites. Samples (algae, invertebrates, fish) were collected from the Raritan Bay Slag Site and reference sites and analyzed for Pb and Hg. Waterfront users were interviewed using a standard questionnaire. Levels of Pb in aquatic organisms were compared to ecological and human health safety standards. Lead levels were related to location, trophic level, and mobility. Lead levels in biota were highest at the western side of the West Jetty. Mean Pb levels were highest for algae (Fucus = 53,600 ± 6990 ng/g = ppb [wet weight], Ulva = 23,900 ± 2430 ppb), intermediate for grass shrimp (7270 ± 1300 ppb, 11,600 ± 3340 ppb), and lowest for fish (Atlantic silversides 218 ± 44 ppb). Within species, Pb levels varied significantly across the sampling sites. Lead levels in algae, sometimes ingested by individuals, were sufficiently high to exceed human safety levels. Mercury levels did not differ between the Superfund and reference sites. Despite the fence and warnings, people (1) used the Superfund and reference sites similarly, (2) had similar fish consumption rates, and (3) were not concerned about Pb, although most individuals knew the metal was present.

22334277,"The neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid (IMI) has been proposed as an alternative to carbaryl for controlling indigenous burrowing shrimp on commercial oyster beds in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor, Washington. A focus of concern over the use of this insecticide in an aquatic environment is the potential for adverse effects from exposure to non-target species residing in the Bay, such as juvenile Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and cutthroat trout (O. clarki). Federal registration and State permiting approval for the use of IMI will require confirmation that the compound does not adversely impact these salmonids following field applications. This will necessitate an environmental monitoring program for evaluating exposure in salmonids following the treatment of beds. Quantification of IMI residues in tissue can be used for determining salmonid exposure to the insecticide. Refinement of an existing protocol using liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detection would provide the low limits of quantification, given the relatively small tissue sample sizes, necessary for determining exposure in individual fish. Such an approach would not be viable for the environmental monitoring effort in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor due to the high costs associated with running multiple analyses, however. A new sample preparation protocol was developed for use with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantification of IMI, thereby providing a low-cost alternative to LC-MS for environmental monitoring in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor. Extraction of the analyte from the salmonid brain tissue was achieved by Dounce homogenization in 4.0 mL of 20.0 mM Triton X-100, followed by a 6 h incubation at 50-55 °C. Centrifugal ultrafiltration and reversed phase solid phase extraction were used for sample cleanup. The limit of quantification for an average 77.0 mg whole brain sample was calculated at 18.2 μg kg(-1) (ppb) with an average recovery of 79%. This relatively low limit of quantification allows for the analysis of individual fish. Using controlled laboratory studies, a curvelinear relationship was found between the measured IMI residue concentrations in brain tissue and exposure concentrations in seawater. Additonally, a range of IMI brain residue concentrations was associated with an overt effect; illustrating the utility of the IMI tissue residue quantification approach for linking exposure with defined effects.",Journal of environmental monitoring : JEM,"['D000818', 'D004784', 'D004797', 'D007093', 'D007306', 'D000073943', 'D009574', 'D010573', 'D012474', 'D014874']","['Animals', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Imidazoles', 'Insecticides', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Salmon', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Development of a new method for the determination of residues of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid in juvenile chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) using ELISA detection.,"[None, 'Q000295', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, 'instrumentation', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22334277,2012

Fish and shrimp samples were extracted with citrate buffer/acetonitrile, and the extracts were purified on strong cation-exchange (SCX) solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. After conversion of LMG into MG using a post column oxidation reactor containing lead (IV) oxide (PbO(2)), the effluents were analysed. Residues were analysed using positive-ion electrospray ionisation (ESI). Identification and quantification of analytes were based on the ion transitions monitored by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Validation of the method was carried out in accordance with the Decision 2002/657/EC, which establishes criteria and procedures for the validation of methods. The following parameters were determined: decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), linearity, accuracy, precision, selectivity, specificity and matrix effect. The decision limits (CCα) for MG, LMG, CV and LCV were 0.164, 0.161, 0.248 and 0.860 µg kg(-1). The respective detection capabilities (CCβ) were 0.222, 0.218, 0.355 and 1.162 µg kg(-1).

Octopus AK could react with mouse anti-shrimp AK and rabbit anti-crab AK polyclonal antibody singly. Octopus AK could also react with specific IgE of the sera from octopus-allergic patients effectively, whereas crab AK could inhibit the reaction between them. Finally, the IgE-binding activity of octopus AK could be reduced in the processes of thermal or acid-alkali treatment.

Such uses have been linked to pesticide contamination and toxicity in urban aquatic ecosystems. Fipronil is a relatively new and popular urban-use insecticide that has acute toxicity to arthropods at low-ppb levels. In this study, we collected runoff water from 6 large communities, each consisting of 152 to 460 single-family homes, in Sacramento County and Orange County, California, and evaluated the occurrence of fipronil and its biologically active derivatives over 26 months under dry weather conditions. Statistical modeling showed that the levels of fipronil and derivatives in the runoff water were both spatially and temporally correlated. More than 10-fold differences were observed between the Sacramento and Orange County sites, with the much higher levels for Orange County (southern California) coinciding with heavier use. The median concentrations of combined fipronil and derivatives for the Orange County sites were 204-440 ng L(-1), with the 90th percentile levels ranging from 340 to 1170 ng L(-1). These levels frequently exceeded the LC50 values for arthropods such as mysid shrimp and grass shrimp. The highest levels occurred from April to October, while decreases were seen from October to December and from January to March, likely reflecting seasonal use patterns and the effect of rain-induced washoff. Fipronil and fipronil sulfone (oxidation derivative) each accounted for about 35% of the total concentrations, with desulfinyl fipronil (a photolytic product) contributing about 25%.

The method uses quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS)-based extraction and HPLC with fluorescence detection (FLD). The method was developed and validated in response to the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Rapid and highly sensitive PAH screening methods are critical tools needed for oil spill response; they help to assess when seafood is safe for harvesting and consumption. Sample preparation involves SPE of edible seafood portions with acetonitrile, followed by the addition of salts to induce water partitioning. After centrifugation, a portion of the acetonitrile layer is filtered prior to analysis via HPLC-FLD. The chromatographic method uses a polymeric C18 stationary phase designed for PAH analysis with gradient elution, and it resolves 15 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency priority parent PAHs in fewer than 20 min.

21908015,"Small-scale gold mining in Portovelo-Zaruma, Southern Equador, performed by mercury amalgamation and cyanidation, yields 9-10 t of gold/annum, resulting in annual releases of around 0.65 t of inorganic mercury and 6000 t of sodium cyanide in the local river system. The release of sediments, cyanide, mercury, and other metals present in the ore such as lead, manganese and arsenic significantly reduces biodiversity downstream the processing plants and enriches metals in bottom sediments and biota. However, methylmercury concentrations in sediments downstream the mining area were recently found to be one order of magnitude lower than upstream or in small tributaries. In this study we investigated cyanide, bacterial activity in water and sediment and mercury methylation potentials in sediments along the Puyango river watershed, measured respectively by in-situ spectrophotometry and incubation with (3)H-leucine and (203)Hg(2+). Free cyanide was undetectable (<1 μg·L(-1)) upstream mining activities, reached 280 μg·L(-1) a few km downstream the processing plants area and was still detectable about 100 km downstream. At stations with detectable free cyanide in unfiltered water, 50% of it was dissolved and 50% associated to suspended particles. Bacterial activity and mercury methylation in sediment showed a similar spatial pattern, inverse to the one found for free cyanide in water, i.e. with significant values in pristine upstream sampling points (respectively 6.4 to 22 μgC·mg wet weight(-1)·h(-1) and 1.2 to 19% of total (203) Hg·gdry weight(-1)·day(-1)) and undetectable downstream the processing plants, returning to upstream values only in the most distant downstream stations. The data suggest that free cyanide oxidation was slower than would be expected from the high water turbulence, resulting in a long-range inhibition of bacterial activity and hence mercury methylation. The important mercury fluxes resultant from mining activities raise concerns about its biomethylation in coastal areas where many mangrove areas have been converted to shrimp farming.",The Science of the total environment,"['D001419', 'D003486', 'D004484', 'D019015', 'D006046', 'D008628', 'D019216', 'D008745', 'D008767', 'D008906', 'D045483', 'D014874']","['Bacteria', 'Cyanides', 'Ecuador', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Gold', 'Mercury', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Methylation', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Mining', 'Rivers', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Long-range effect of cyanide on mercury methylation in a gold mining area in southern Ecuador.,"['Q000187', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000187', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['drug effects', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'drug effects', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21908015,2012
21907019,"Residues of steroid hormones have become a cause for concern because they can affect the biological activity of non-target organisms. Steroid hormones are a potential risk for wildlife and humans through the consumption of contaminated food or water. Their determination requires extraction and clean-up steps, prior to detection, to reach low concentration levels. In recent years, a great effort has been made to develop new analytical methodologies, such as microextraction techniques, that reduce environmental pollution. Researchers have modified old methods to incorporate procedures that use less-hazardous chemicals or that use smaller amounts of them. They are able to do direct analysis using miniaturised equipment and reduced amounts of solvents and wastes. These accomplishments are the main objectives of green analytical chemistry. In this overview, we focus on microextraction techniques for the determination of steroid hormones in biological (e.g., human urine, human serum, fish, shrimp and prawn tissue and milk) and environmental (e.g., wastewaters, surface waters, tap waters, river waters, sewage sludges, marine sediments and river sediments) samples. We comment on the most recent applications in sorptive-microextraction modes, such as solid phase microextraction (SPME) with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), in-tube solid-phase microextraction (IT-SPME), stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) and microextraction in packed sorbent (MEPS).

21859532,"Over 97% of the Earth's water is high salinity water in the form of gulfs, oceans, and salt lakes. There is an increasing concern for the quality of water in bays, gulfs, oceans, and other natural waters. These waters are affected by many different sources of contamination. The sources are, but not limited to, groundwater run-off of nitrogen containing fertilizer, pesticides, cleaning agents, solid wastes, industrial waters, and many more. The final destinations of these contaminants are rivers, lakes, and bayous that eventually will lead to bays, gulfs, and oceans. Many industries depend on the quality of these waters, such as the fishing industry. In addition to wild marine life, there are large aquariums and fish and shrimp farms that are required to know the quality of the water. However, the ability of these industries to monitor their processes is limited. Most analytical methods do not apply to the analysis of high salinity waters. They are dependent on wet chemistry techniques, spectrophotometers, and flow analyzers. These methods do not have the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity when compared to ion chromatography (IC). Since the inception of IC, it has become a standard practice for determining the content of many different water samples. Many IC methods are limited in the range of analytes that can be detected, as well as the numerous sample sources of which the methods are applicable. The main focus of current IC methods does not include high salinity waters. This research demonstrates an ion chromatographic method that has the ability to determine low level concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and related anions (nitrite-N, nitrate-N, phosphorous-P, sulfate, bromide, chloride, sulfide, fluoride, ammonia, calcium, and magnesium) in a single run using a combination of UV and conductivity detectors.

Samples comprised ten different food products covering five matrices: muscle (cattle, swine and chicken), liver (chicken), raw fish (shrimp and salmon), egg (chicken), and processed food (ham, sausage and fish sausage). This method involved a simple extraction with (1:1) acetonitrile-methanol, a highly selective clean-up with an immobilised metal chelate affinity column charged with Fe(3+), a fast isocratic LC analysis using a short column (20 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 µm) with a mobile phase of (15:85:0.1) methanol/water/formic acid, and fluorescence detection (excitation/emission wavelengths of 295 nm/455 nm for FQs (495 nm for MAR), and 320 nm/365 nm for AQs). Among FQs, pairs of NOR/OFL, ORB/DIF and ENR/DAN were incompletely resolved.

21472772,"Artificial substrates consisting of fine milled silica with or without α-cellulose were evaluated for their capacity to support survival, growth, and fecundity in the amphipod Melita plumulosa. There were no significant differences in the survival and fecundity of adult amphipods maintained for up to 13 d on natural sediment, silica-only, or silica/α-cellulose substrate when fed two algal foods, Sera micron and Rotiselco-ALG. However, growth among juveniles maintained on the silica/α-cellulose mixture was significantly inhibited over 14 d compared with natural sediment. Addition of a microencapsulated shrimp feed, Frippak, to the algal foods improved juvenile growth over 28 d but still did not match the nutritive value of natural sediment. Fine silica without cellulose was subsequently used in acute and reproductive toxicity tests with waterborne zinc. With food, a 10-d median lethal concentration (LC50) of 140 µg Zn/L and a 10-d no-effect concentration (NEC) of 80 µg Zn/L were obtained for juvenile survival on silica. In contrast, a 10-d LC50 of 200 µg Zn/L and a 10-d NEC of 180 µg Zn/L were obtained for juveniles in water-only exposures. Similarly, exposure of adult females to Zn without food on silica compared with water-only exposures gave 10-d LC50s of 380 and 490 µg Zn/L and 10-d NECs of 130 and 370 µg Zn/L, respectively. The reproduction toxicity test indicated significant adult mortality at 92 µg Zn/L and significantly reduced fecundity at 22 µg Zn/L.

Crude extracts from Fusarium acuminatum, Fusarium avenaceum, Fusarium tricinctum and Fusarium sambucinum, along with enniatins A, A1, B and B1 purified from a Western Australian strain of F. acuminatum using semi-preparative HPLC, were bioassayed using brine shrimp. All Fusarium isolates produced both enniatins B and B1, except for F. tricinctum WAC 8019, and 11 of the 17 isolates produced enniatin A1. Overall, all of the F. avenaceum isolates produced high amounts of enniatins, in particular enniatin B. One isolate of F. acuminatum (WAC 5715) and of F. tricinctum (WAC 11486) also produced high amounts of both enniatins B and B1. Only F. acuminatum WAC 5715 produced enniatin A among the tested isolates. All four purified enniatins A, A1, B, B1, individually and in combination, caused brine shrimp toxicity after 6 h of exposure, implicating that this emerging class of mycotoxin as a cause of the acute toxicity to brine shrimp observed. The mixture of all four enniatins was the most toxic to brine shrimp compared to purified individual enniatins, where the relative toxicity order was B > B1 > A1 > A.

Zymography analysis showed that the three pepsinogens had different mobilities and enzymatic activities under native conditions. Pepsinogens converted into their active form pepsins under pH 2.0 by one-step pathway or stepwise pathway. All three pepsins were completely inhibited by pepstatin A, a typical aspartic proteinase inhibitor. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the three pepsinogens were determined to the 30th, 30th and 28th amino acid residue and those of their corresponding active form pepsins were also determined to the 19th, 18th and 20th amino acid residue, respectively.

Reverse-phase chromatography using an octadecyl silica (C18) column and water/acetonitrile gradient elution was used to separate analyte mixtures. After separation, PAHs were detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) equipped with the atmospheric pressure photoionization (PhotoSpray APPI) source operating in the positive-ion mode. In this methodology, all 16 common PAHs were used and toluene served as a charged dopant to efficiently ionize analyte molecules through secondary reactions. Spikes were performed at 0.2 and 1 μg/g with and without primary and secondary amine (PSA) sorbent cleanup. Recoveries of PAHs were good, with ion ratios that agreed well between the spikes and standards. Without cleanup at 0.2 μg/mL, seven compounds had relatively low recovery (49-69%) and one compound, naphthalene, had a somewhat high recovery of 129%. At 1 μg/mL without cleanup, only three compounds had slightly lower recovery (66-67%). When PSA cleanup was performed, all PAH recoveries were within 75-125% at both spike levels.

MEL and CYA in egg, pork, liver, kidney and pork, shrimp, sausage casing, honey, soybean milk, soybean powder and dairy product were extracted using acetonitrile/water, defatted with hexane and isolated using MCT solid phase extraction column. The residues were separated upon a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column and analyzed by electrospray ionization under negative-positive switched mode on a triplequadrupole mass spectrometry. The selected reaction monitoring was performed on [M+H](+) of m/z 127.9 to provide the transition of 127>85 and 127>68 (MEL) while the [M-H](-) of m/z 127.1 was selected as the precursor ion for CYA resulting in product ions m/z 85 and 42.

20701973,"The toxicity of carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate and profenofos to the freshwater shrimp, Paratya australiensis was assessed by measuring acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition after 96h exposures. Shrimp exposed to these pesticides exhibited significant AChE inhibition, with mortality in shrimp corresponding to 70-90% AChE inhibition. The sensitivity of P. australiensis to the four pesticides based on AChE inhibition can be given as chlorpyrifos > profenofos > carbaryl > dimethoate. Recovery of AChE activity was followed in shrimp after 96 h exposures to carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and dimethoate. Recovery after exposure to the carbamate pesticide carbaryl was more rapid than for the two organophosphorus pesticides, chlorpyrifos and dimethoate. The slow recovery of depressed AChE activity may mean that affected organisms in the natural system are unable to sustain physical activities such as searching for food or eluding predators. To investigate the ecological significance of AChE inhibition, chemotaxis behaviour was assessed in shrimp exposed to profenofos for 24h. Abnormal chemotaxis behaviour in the exposed shrimp was observed at concentrations representing 30-50% AChE inhibition. A clear relationship existed between the depression of AChE activity and observed chemotaxis responses, such as approaching and grasping the chemoattractant source. These results suggest that in vivo toxicity tests based on this specific biomarker are sensitive and present advantages over conventional acute tests based on mortality. Behavioural studies of test organisms conducted in conjunction with measurement of AChE inhibition will provide data to clarify the toxic effects caused by sublethal chemical concentrations of anti-cholinesterase compounds.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,"['D000110', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D012721', 'D002633', 'D004390', 'D002800', 'D002851', 'D033364', 'D004117', 'D008401', 'D007306', 'D063086', 'D012680', 'D013021', 'D013997', 'D018675', 'D014874']","['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Carbaryl', 'Chemotaxis', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Decapoda', 'Dimethoate', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Insecticides', 'Organothiophosphates', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'South Australia', 'Time Factors', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']","Response and recovery of acetylcholinesterase activity in freshwater shrimp, Paratya australiensis (Decapoda: Atyidae) exposed to selected anti-cholinesterase insecticides.","['Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['metabolism', None, None, None, 'drug effects', None, 'analysis', None, 'drug effects', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20701973,2011

Bacillus subtilis was used as a sensitive strain to target antibiotics. Culture conditions on Petri plates (pH of medium) were selected to enhance the capacity of antibiotic detection. Antibiotic residues were extracted from shrimps using acetonitrile/acetone (70/30, v/v) before application on Petri plates seeded with B. subtilis. The method was validated using spiked blank tissues as well as antibiotic treated shrimps with enrofloxacin and tetracycline, two antibiotics often found to be used in shrimp production. For tetracyclines and (fluoro)quinolones, the detection capability was below the maximum residue limit (MRL), while it was around the MRL for sulfonamides. The specificity of the microbiological screening was 100% in all cases while the sensitivity and accuracy was 100% in almost all cases.

A total of 95 spots representing 75 protein entries were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with both online and in-house database. According to Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of biological process, the identified proteins were classified into 13 categories. Among them, approximately 36% of proteins related to cytoskeleton are noticeable. Then, a comparative proteomic approach was employed to investigate the differentially expressed proteins in lymphoid organ of Vibrio anguillarum-challenged F. chinensis. At 24 h post-injection (hpi), 17 differentially expressed protein spots were successfully identified, including 4 up-regulated protein spots (represent 4 proteins: cathepsin L, protein similar to squid CG16901-PC, protein kinase C and protein similar to T-complex Chaperonin 5 CG8439-PA), and 13 down-regulated protein spots (represent 9 proteins: actin, beta-actin, cytoplasmic actin CyII, alpha tubulin, beta tubulin, protein similar to proteasome delta, vacuolar ATP synthase subunit B, elongation factor 2, carboxypeptidase B).

20227703,"This work describes a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) procedure for multiplex screening, ultratrace quantification and reliable confirmation of barbital series residues in animal-derived food matrices. The method is developed based on a distinct dependency of the electrospray ionization (ESI) response of nine structural homologues on LC eluent properties and gas-phase ion chemistry during the ESI process. The ""wrong-way-round"" negative ionization aspect has been explored to optimize the compatibility of the hyphenated LC-MS/MS technique, which facilitates detection limits at 30-100-fold lower than 0.01 ppm without derivatization or post-column basification step. A mobile phase using methanol modified with 0.01% acetic acid is adopted to achieve an approximately 2-9-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio over the results under suboptimal conditions. There is no significant differential matrix effects or deuterium isotope effects on chromatographic retention and ESI responsiveness at all levels across the different analyte-matrix pairs. Mean recoveries ranged from 79.6% (barbital) to 108% (secobarbital) at fortified levels of 0.5-20 ng/g within relative standard deviations less than 11%. Between-run repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility were 3-11% and 5-13%, respectively. An ion ratio criterion for valid detection limit data for simultaneous screening of homologous multiresidues in complex sample matrices is proposed. The satisfactory applicability of the newly described procedure to 43 real samples including pork, poultry meat, swine liver, fish tissue and shrimp muscle demonstrated the LC-MS/MS technique with facile sample handling can serve as an attractive alternative analytical method accepted for regulatory purpose.",Journal of chromatography.

The bacteriocin was purified from a culture supernatant to homogeneity as confirmed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis revealed a single active fraction eluted at 12.94 min, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis showed the molecular mass to be 9.244 kDa. This molecular mass does not correspond to previously described streptococcal bacteriocins. The purified bacteriocin was named phocaecin PI80 from its producer strain, as this is the first report of bacteriocin production by Streptococcus phocae. The bacteriocin exhibited a broad spectrum of activity and inhibited important pathogens: Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and V. fischeri. The antibacterial substance was also sensitive to proteolytic enzymes: trypsin, protease, pepsin, and chymotrypsin, yet insensitive to catalase, peroxidase, and diastase, confirming that the inhibition was due to a proteinaceous molecule (i.e., the bacteriocin), and not due to hydrogen peroxide or diacetyl. Phocaecin PI80 moderately tolerated heat treatment (up to 70 degrees for 10 min) and resisted certain solvents (acetone, ethanol, and butanol). A massive leakage of K+ ions from E. coli DH5alpha, L. monocytogenes, and V. parahaemolyticus was induced by phocaecin PI80, as measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICPOES). Therefore, the results of this study show that phocaecin PI80 may be a useful tool for inhibiting L. monocytogenes in seafood products that do not usually undergo adequate heat treatment, whereas the cells of Streptococcus phocae PI80 could be used to control vibriosis in shrimp farming.",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,"['D048908', 'D000818', 'D000900', 'D001430', 'D010450', 'D004926', 'D005516', 'D005519', 'D041981', 'D006358', 'D008089', 'D008826', 'D008970', 'D033561', 'D010544', 'D011188', 'D013291', 'D014736']","['Aliivibrio fischeri', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacteriocins', 'Endopeptidases', 'Escherichia coli', 'Food Microbiology', 'Food Preservation', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Hot Temperature', 'Listeria monocytogenes', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Molecular Weight', 'Penaeidae', 'Peroxidases', 'Potassium', 'Streptococcus', 'Vibrio parahaemolyticus']",Purification and characterization of phocaecin PI80: an anti-listerial bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus phocae PI80 Isolated from the gut of Peneaus indicus (Indian white shrimp).,"['Q000187', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000302', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000382', None, 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000382', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000302', 'Q000187']","['drug effects', None, 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', None, None, 'microbiology', None, 'drug effects', None, None, 'microbiology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'isolation & purification', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19996693,2010

19852991,"The shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei is arguably the most important aquacultured crustacean, being the subject of a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide. To extend our knowledge of peptidergic control in this species, we conducted an investigation combining transcriptomics and mass spectrometry to identify its neuropeptides. Specifically, in silico searches of the L. vannamei EST database were conducted to identify putative prepro-hormone-encoding transcripts, with the mature peptides contained within the deduced precursors predicted via online software programs and homology to known isoforms. MALDI-FT mass spectrometry was used to screen tissue fragments and extracts via accurate mass measurements for the predicted peptides, as well as for known ones from other species. ESI-Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometry was used to de novo sequence peptides from tissue extracts. In total 120 peptides were characterized using this combined approach, including 5 identified both by transcriptomics and by mass spectrometry (e.g. pQTFQYSRGWTNamide, Arg(7)-corazonin, and pQDLDHVFLRFamide, a myosuppressin), 49 predicted via transcriptomics only (e.g. pQIRYHQCYFNPISCF and pQIRYHQCYFIPVSCF, two C-type allatostatins, and RYLPT, authentic proctolin), and 66 identified solely by mass spectrometry (e.g. the orcokinin NFDEIDRAGMGFA). While some of the characterized peptides were known L. vannamei isoforms (e.g. the pyrokinins DFAFSPRLamide and ADFAFNPRLamide), most were novel, either for this species (e.g. pEGFYSQRYamide, an RYamide) or in general (e.g. the tachykinin-related peptides APAGFLGMRamide, APSGFNGMRamide and APSGFLDMRamide).

Among them, seven sequences are new as compared to those reported in the database specifically for peptaibols and in the literature. In addition, we obtained experimental evidence suggesting the existence of non-covalent dimeric forms (homo- and hetero-) of the various peptaibol species. The peptide mixture showed strong antifungal activity toward seven important forest tree pathogens, and it was highly toxic in an Artemia salina (brine shrimp) bioassay.

Parameters affecting the performance of the in situ derivatization process such as type of extraction solvent, temperature, extraction time, stirring speed and salt addition were studied and optimized. Under the optimized conditions (extraction solvent, dihexyl ether; acceptor phase, 0.1M HCl; extraction time, 30 min; extraction temperature, 26 degrees C; without addition of salt), enrichment factors varying from 47 to 456 were achieved. Good linearity of the analytes was obtained over a concentration range of 0.1-5 microg mL(-1) (with correlation coefficients of 0.9901-0.9974). The limits of detection and quantification based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3-10, ranged from 0.0075 to 0.030 microg mL(-1) and 0.03 to 0.10 microg mL(-1), respectively. The relative standard deviations based on the peak areas for six replicate analysis of water spiked with 0.5 microg mL(-1) of each biogenic amine were lower than 7.5%.

19370059,"Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are hydrophilic molecules that are believed to function in desiccation and low-temperature tolerance in some plants and plant propagules, certain prokaryotes, and several animal species. The brine shrimp Artemia franciscana can produce encysted embryos (cysts) that enter diapause and are resistant to severe desiccation. This ability is based on biochemical adaptations, one of which appears to be the accumulation of the LEA protein that is the focus of this study. The studies described herein characterize a 21 kDa protein in encysted Artemia embryos as a group 1 LEA protein. The amino acid sequence of this protein and its gene have been determined and entered into the NCBI database (no. EF656614). The LEA protein consists of 182 amino acids and it is extremely hydrophilic, with glycine (23%), glutamine (17%), and glutamic acid (12.6%) being the most abundant amino acids. This protein also consists of 8 tandem repeats of a 20 amino acid sequence, which is characteristic of group 1 LEA proteins from non-animal species. The LEA protein and its gene are expressed only in encysted embryos and not in larvae or adults. Evidence is presented to show that the LEA protein functions in the prevention of drying-induced protein aggregation, which supports its functional role in desiccation tolerance. This report describes, for the first time, the purification and characterization of a group 1 LEA protein from an animal species.",Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D000838', 'D001156', 'D001483', 'D002412', 'D002850', 'D002852', 'D002950', 'D003890', 'D004625', 'D047108', 'D018507', 'D015723', 'D006358', 'D013058', 'D008969', 'D008970', 'D016133', 'D020836', 'D011506', 'D012333', 'D020539', 'D014199']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Artemia', 'Base Sequence', 'Cations', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Citrate (si)-Synthase', 'Desiccation', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Embryonic Development', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Library', 'Hot Temperature', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Trehalose']",Characterization of a group 1 late embryogenesis abundant protein in encysted embryos of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000196', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, 'embryology', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'genetics', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19370059,2009
19286018,"In May 2007, investigators discovered that waste material from the pet food manufacturing process contaminated with melamine (MEL) and/or cyanuric acid (CYA) had been added to hog and chicken feeds. At this time, investigators also learned that adulterated wheat gluten had been used in the manufacture of aquaculture feeds. Concern that the contaminated feed had been used in aquaculture and could enter the human food supply prompted the development of a method for the determination of CYA residues in the edible tissues of fish and shrimp. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was employed as a sensitive technique for the analysis of CYA in catfish, tilapia, salmon, trout and shrimp tissue. CYA was extracted from ground fish or shrimp with an acetic acid solution, defatted with hexane, and isolated with a graphitic carbon black solid-phase extraction column. Residues were separated from matrix components using a porous graphitic carbon LC column, and then analyzed with electrospray ionization in negative ion mode on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Selective reaction monitoring was performed on the [M-H](-)m/z 128 ion resulting in the product ions m/z 85 and 42. Recoveries from catfish, tilapia and trout fortified with 10-100 microgkg(-1) of CYA averaged 67% with a relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 18% (n=107). The average method detection limit (MDL) for catfish, tilapia and trout is 3.5 microgkg(-1). An internal standard, (13)C(3)-labeled CYA, was used in the salmon and shrimp extractions. Average recovery of CYA from salmon was 91% (R.S.D.=15%, n=18) with an MDL of 7.4 microgkg(-1).

19203611,"An improved sheath-flow interface used to couple capillary electrophoresis (CE) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and a microwave-assisted extraction used to extract each arsenic species in seafood were developed in this work. The improved sheath-flow interface completely avoids laminar flow in CE capillary caused by the suction from ICP-MS, makes electric supply more stable in CE, and transports analyte solution to ICP-MS easily and more efficiently. CE-ICP-MS coupled with our interface have two quantitative analysis modes: continuous sample-introduction mode and collective sample-introduction mode. The collective sample-introduction technique greatly reduced the dead volume of interface to approximately zero, obviously avoided the excessive dilution of analyte, and eventually led to a much lower detection limit and a much better electrophoretic resolution. This was demonstrated by the better symmetry and narrow peak widths (10-12s) and much lower detection limits (0.030-0.042 microg/L) of four species of arsenic determined with collective sample-introduction mode. With the help of this improved sheath-flow interface and the microwave-assisted extraction, we have successfully separated and determined four arsenic species, As(III), As(V), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in dried Mya arenaria Linnaeus and Shrimp samples using CE-ICP-MS within 10 min with a relative standard deviation of 2-4% (peak areas, n=6) and a recovery of 96-105%.",Talanta,"['D000818', 'D001151', 'D019075', 'D005506', 'D013058', 'D008872', 'D049892', 'D033561', 'D012758']","['Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Food Contamination', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microwaves', 'Mya', 'Penaeidae', 'Shellfish']",Speciation analysis of arsenic in Mya arenaria Linnaeus and Shrimp with capillary electrophoresis-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19203611,2009

We have previously established that M. plumulosa cultures perform poorly and eventually decline if provided with silty sediment alone, but will thrive if supplemented with Sera micron. Conversely, if the amphipods are cultured on a nutrient-depleted sand substrate, Sera micron alone does not constitute an adequate feed. The major difference in the fatty acid composition of M. plumulosa cultured on silty sediment compared to amphipods cultured on a sand substrate and both fed Sera micron was an increase in the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs, indicating that the silty sediment provides additional food sources rich in omega-3 PUFAs. Furthermore, amphipods cultured in sand and fed any of the three algal-based foods or the Frippak powder as the sole food source had poor survival rates, although Sera micron maintained the best survival-this was attributed to it containing high amounts of beta-carotene and terpenoids.

However, its overall sequence identity to other trypsins of this systematic class is comparatively low. The high resistance against autoproteolysis was determined by mass spectrometry, which revealed a low susceptibility of the N-terminal domain towards autolysis.

The production of extrolites by selected terverticillate penicillia isolated from dry-cured ham has been studied on carbohydrate-rich media (malt extract agar, Czapek yeast autolysate agar, rice extract agar, and rice), meat extract triolein salt agar, and ham slices. Chloroform extracts from the selected strains grown on malt extract agar were toxic for the brine shrimp (Artemia salina) larvae and VERO cells at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, but 0.02 mg/ml produced no toxic effect. Analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with photodiode array detection (DAD) or with mass spectrometry (MS) and an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source revealed different biologically active metabolites: cyclopiazonic acid and rugulovasine A from Penicillium commune; verrucosidin, anacine, puberuline, verrucofortine, and viridicatols from Penicillium polonicum; arisugacin and viridicatols from Penicillium echinulatum; and compactin and viridicatols from Penicillium solitum. Most of these metabolites, including the amino acid-derived compounds, were produced in the media containing high levels of carbohydrates. High concentrations of nitrogen compounds in the medium does not imply a greater production of the metabolites studied, not even those derived from the amino acids. However, molds growing on dry-cured ham are able to synthesize limited amounts of some secondary metabolites, a fact not previously reported. The combination of HPLC coupled with DAD and MS-APCI was useful for identification of closely related terverticillate Penicillium species from dry-cured ham.

Grass shrimp addition consistently enhanced Ruppia biomass and shoot density in a series of three field experiments conducted in Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Mississippi, USA. In two experiments, epiphyte grazing by grass shrimp enhanced Ruppia by inhibiting die-back during the mid- and latter stages of the Ruppia life cycle. Despite a nonsignificant epiphyte grazing effect, grass shrimp also enhanced Ruppia during its early growth stage in a third experiment. In that experiment, nutrient addition also significantly increased epiphyte biomass.

Fish samples (tilapia) were also collected. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results indicated that under wet season wet deposition and suspended particulates brought in by nearby rivers, such as the Peal River, served as an important source of PAHs entering Mai Po Marshes. Total organic matter in the sediments showed significant correlations (p<0.01) with PAHs in the sediments, mainly due to the mechanism that organic matter such as humic substances increased PAH persistence by binding and occluding PAHs. Except for naphthalene, biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) of the PAHs in tilapia were below 1.7, which may be caused by biotransformation and the lower uptake in fish. In addition, aqueous route dominated accumulation of non-biodegradable PAHs in tilapia because higher levels were detected in larger fish than in smaller ones. A general trend was observed that BSAFs declined with the increase of K(ow) values, which suggested that bioavailability of low K(ow) isomers was high due to higher gill transfer efficiencies (aqueous uptake) in fish but enhanced biotransformation and decreased gut assimilation (dietary uptake) resulted in decreased accumulation of more hydrophobic PAHs (high K(ow)). Lastly, viscera appeared to be a promising tissue for biomonitoring, as it contained much higher concentrations than the muscle (3.5 magnitudes), and the levels in the muscle were significantly correlated with those in the viscera (r2=0.938, p<0.0001).",Water research,"['D000818', 'D004784', 'D008401', 'D019015', 'D009132', 'D011084', 'D012621', 'D017210', 'D014781', 'D053833']","['Animals', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Muscles', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons', 'Seasons', 'Tilapia', 'Viscera', 'Wetlands']","Distribution patterns of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the sediments and fish at Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve, Hong Kong.","[None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17258265,2007

17171303,"The use of various organophosphates to control mosquito populations is a common practice across the globe. We review the literature (LC50s) on dichlorvos, the primary breakdown product of Dibrom, and use laboratory and field experiments to determine the lethal and sublethal (bioassays) effects of dichlorvos on two widely distributed and ecologically important estuarine invertebrate species, the marsh grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio and the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Laboratory results based on LC50s and sublethal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition activity bioassays indicate that adult grass shrimp are more sensitive (approximately 500 x ) to dichlorvos than juvenile oysters. Although potentially an important factor for intertidal or shallow-dwelling estuarine organisms, the toxicity of dichlorvos was not enhanced in the presence of simulated sunlight for adult P. pugio. The most notable decreases in AChE activity were for grass shrimp and oysters exposed to dichlorvos concentrations above those considered ecologically relevant. In field experiments, both species were deployed in cages in unsprayed (n = 2) and sprayed (n = 3) sites and water samples collected pre- and post-spraying. Quantifiable dichlorvos levels were measured at the two narrowest creek treatment sites following mosquito spraying, suggesting that overspray can occur and there was evidence of a sublethal AChE response at these same sites. However, experiments at the widest creek revealed no measurable dichlorvos or sublethal responses. Results from this research suggest that adult grass shrimp are more sensitive to dichlorvos than juvenile oysters. Spraying near small tidal creeks may have measurable impacts on resident species, while larger (wider) creeks appear to be capable of buffering organisms from transient fluxes of mosquito control agents that may enter the system.",Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D000367', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D002800', 'D004006', 'D004785', 'D008401', 'D007928', 'D009032', 'D010125', 'D033541', 'D045483', 'D013022', 'D013045', 'D023382']","['Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Dichlorvos', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Mosquito Control', 'Ostreidae', 'Palaemonidae', 'Rivers', 'South Carolina', 'Species Specificity', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute']",Acute toxicity and acetylcholinesterase inhibition in grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica) exposed to the organophosphate dichlorvos: laboratory and field studies.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17171303,2007

17071507,"The presence of carotenoids in animal tissue reflects their sources along the food chain. Astaxanthin, the main carotenoid used for salmonid pigmentation, is usually included in the feed as a synthetic product. However, other dietary sources of astaxanthin such as shrimp or krill wastes, algae meal or yeasts are also available on the market. Astaxanthin possesses two identical asymmetric atoms at C-3 and C-3' making possible three optical isomers with all-trans configuration of the chain: 3S,3'S, 3R,3'S, and 3R,3'R. The distribution of the isomers in natural astaxanthin differs from that of the synthetic product. This latter is a racemic mixture, with a typical ratio of 1:2:1 (3S,3'S:3R,3'S:3R,3'R), while astaxanthin from natural sources has a variable distribution of the isomers deriving from the different biological organism that synthesized it. The high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of all-trans isomers of astaxanthin was performed in different pigment sources, such as red yeast Phaffia rhodozyma, alga meal Haematococcus pluvialis, krill meal and oil, and shrimp meal. With the aim to investigate astaxanthin isomer ratios in flesh of fish fed different carotenoid sources, three groups of rainbow trout were fed for 60 days diets containing astaxanthin from synthetic source, H. pluvialis algae meal and P. rhodozyma red yeast. Moreover, the distribution of optical isomers of astaxanthin in trout purchased on the Italian market was investigated. A characteristic distribution of astaxanthin stereoisomers was detected for each pigment sources and such distribution was reproduced in the flesh of trout fed with that source. Colour values measured in different sites of fillet of rainbow trout fed with different pigment sources showed no significant differences. Similarly, different sources of pigment (natural or synthetic) produced colour values of fresh fillet with no relevant or significant differences.

17065249,"Pyrokinin (PK) peptides localize to the central and peripheral nervous systems of arthropods, but their actions in the CNS have yet to be studied in any species. Here, we identify PK peptide family members in the crab Cancer borealis and characterize their actions on the gastric mill (chewing) and pyloric (filtering) motor circuits in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG). We identified PK-like immunolabeling in the STG neuropil, in projection neuron inputs to this ganglion, and in the neuroendocrine pericardial organs. By combining MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) and ESI tandem MS techniques, we identified the amino acid sequences of two C. borealis pyrokinins (CabPK-I, CabPK-II). Both CabPKs contain the PK family-specific carboxy-terminal amino acid sequence (FXPRLamide). PK superfusion to the isolated STG had little influence on the pyloric rhythm but excited many gastric mill neurons and consistently activated the gastric mill rhythm. Both CabPKs had comparable actions in the STG and these actions were equivalent to those of Pevpyrokinin (shrimp) and Leucopyrokinin (cockroach). The PK-elicited gastric mill rhythm usually occurred without activation of the projection neuron MCN1. MCN1, which does not contain CabPKs, effectively drives the gastric mill rhythm and at such times is also a gastric mill central pattern generator (CPG) neuron. Because the PK-elicited gastric mill rhythm is independent of MCN1, the underlying core CPG of this rhythm is different from the one responsible for the MCN1-elicited rhythm. Thus neuromodulation, which commonly alters motor circuit output without changing the core CPG, can also change the composition of this core circuit.",Journal of neurophysiology,"['D000200', 'D000818', 'D001683', 'D003386', 'D004064', 'D005247', 'D017952', 'D007150', 'D008297', 'D008409', 'D009046', 'D009415', 'D009420', 'D009479', 'D010507']","['Action Potentials', 'Animals', 'Biological Clocks', 'Brachyura', 'Digestive System', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Ganglia, Invertebrate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Mastication', 'Motor Neurons', 'Nerve Net', 'Nervous System', 'Neuropeptides', 'Periodicity']",Modulation of rhythmic motor activity by pyrokinin peptides.,"['Q000187', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000166', 'Q000294', 'Q000187', 'Q000166', None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000187', 'Q000166', 'Q000166', 'Q000302', None]","['drug effects', None, 'drug effects', 'cytology', 'innervation', 'drug effects', 'cytology', None, None, 'physiology', 'drug effects', 'cytology', 'cytology', 'isolation & purification', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17065249,2007

The Cd2+ ions were bound between the monomer interfaces of the homodimer. Various divalent metal ions have been titrated against VP9, and their interactions were analyzed using NMR spectroscopy. The titration data indicated that VP9 binds with both Zn2+ and Cd2+. VP9 adopts a similar fold as the DNA binding domain of the papillomavirus E2 protein.

19127725,"Fortification of aquaculture foodstuff with various algae may improve the resistance of certain fish or shrimp to diseases and, as a routine procedure, has become ever more popular and, seemingly, important. Herein, we isolated certain alkali-soluble polysaccharides from a Rhizoclonium riparium alga (RASP), polysaccharides that can be separated into two different groups on the basis of the polysaccharide's molecular weight. Using gas chromatography-mass spectometry analysis, we found that the major monosaccharides constituting the higher molecular-weight group of RASP were galactose (41.99%), glucose (34.53%), xylose (20.24%), and mannose (3.24%). Using a murine-derived macrophage cell line J774A.1, we found that polysaccharide constituents of the higher molecular-weight group of RASP were able to induce interleukin-1beta (IL-1) gene expression via protein kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways. In essence, we found that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), play an important role in the regulation of IL-1 gene expression in RASP-stimulated J774A.1 cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first occasion that polysaccharides from R. riparium have been demonstrated to exert immunomodulation properties by the induction of IL-1 within macrophages.

The molecular masses and pIs of HoChiA, HoChiB, and HoChiC are 62 kDa and pH 5.7, 51 kDa and pH 7.6, and 47 kDa and pH 8.8, respectively. Substrate specificities of these chitinases were compared with those of another fish stomach chitinase from the common mackerel, Scomber japonicus (SjChi), as well as two from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (MsChi535 and MsChi386). The efficiency parameters, kcat/Km, toward glycolchitin for HoChiA and SjChi were larger than those for HoChiB and HoChiC. The relative activities of HoChiA and SjChi toward various forms of chitin were as follows: shrimp shell or crab shell alpha-chitin > beta-chitin >> silkworm cuticle alpha-chitin. On the other hand, the relative activities of HoChiB and HoChiC were beta-chitin >> silkworm alpha-chitin > shrimp and crab alpha-chitin. MsChi535 preferred silkworm alpha-chitin to shrimp and crab alpha-chitins, and no activity was observed toward beta-chitin. MsChi386, which lacked the C-terminal linker region and the chitin-binding domain, did not hydrolyze silkworm alpha-chitin.

The method is also a useful screen for histamine (HTA). The method involves homogenization of fish tissue, extraction of biogenic amines into borate-trichloroacetic acid solution, centrifugation, and derivatization of supernatant with 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester. The derivatized diamine species allow for the intramolecular excimer fluorescence of the pyrene moiety at a higher emission wavelength than is possible for the endogenous tissue monoamines, thus providing visual specificity of detection. All seafood species were fortified with 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 microg/g (ppm) of PUT and CAD. Determination was based on standard graphs for PUT and CAD using peak areas with standard solutions equivalent to 0.375, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 ppm in tissue. A set of five matrix controls (unfortified seafood tissue) were also analyzed; endogenous PUT was found in all samples except the canned tuna, and CAD found only in the shrimp, crab, and cold-smoked salmon.

Four of the groups of invertebrates were benthic macroinvertebrates collected from metals-contaminated rivers (the Clark Fork River in Montana and the Coeur d'Alene River in Idaho, USA); the other two groups of invertebrates (one of which was exposed to metals in the laboratory) were laboratory-reared brine shrimp (Artemia sp.). Additionally, we fractionated the pH 2 leachates using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Protein content was 1.3 to 1.4x higher in Artemia than in the benthic macroinvertebrates, and leachability of metals and protein differed considerably among several of the groups of invertebrates. In SEC fractions of the pH 2 leachates from both groups of Artemia, Cu and protein co-eluted; however, Cu and protein did not co-elute in SEC fractions of the leachates from any of the benthic macroinvertebrate groups. Although none of the other three metals co-eluted with protein in any of the pH 2 leachates, one or more of the metals co-eluted with lower-molecular-weight molecules in the leachates from all of the groups of invertebrates.

The major sources of pollution are represented by the waste effluents from the intensive agriculture and the urban sewage from the cities of Culiacán (population of 750000) and Navolato (population of 50000). In this lagoon system diverse penaeid shrimps occur; the crystal shrimp Farfantepenaeus brevirostris, the brown shrimp F. californiensis, the blue shrimp Litopenaeus stylirostris, the white shrimp L. vannamei and the Pacific seabob Xiphopenaeus kroyeri. With the purpose of knowing distribution and relative concentrations of Hg in the main tissues of penaeid shrimps, levels of Hg in five species from Altata-Enesenada del Pabellón lagoon on the SE Gulf of California were determined.

15479230,"We reported previously that the major cysteine protease in embryos and larvae of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a catalytic subunit (28.5 kDa) with a high degree of homology with cathepsin L, and a noncatalytic subunit (31.5 kDa) of unknown function. In the study reported here the noncatalytic subunit, or cathepsin L-associated protein (CLAP), was separated from cathepsin L by chromatography on Mono S and found to contain multiple isoforms with pIs ranging from 5.9 to 6.1. Heterodimeric and monomeric cathepsin L showed similar activity between pH 5 and 6.5, while the heterodimer was about twice as active as monomeric cathepsin L below pH 5. The heterodimer was more stable than the monomer between pH 6 and 7.4 and at 30-50 degrees C. Artemia CLAP and cathepsin L are present in nearly equimolar amounts at all stages in the life cycle and most abundant in encysted eggs and embyros. Moreover, CLAP, either free or as a complex with cathepsin L, was resistant to hydrolysis by cathepsin L. Two clones coding for CLAP were isolated from an Artemia embryo cDNA library and sequenced. Both clones have nearly identical open reading frames, but show differences at the 5'- and 3'-termini. Each cDNA clone has an extensive 3'-untranslated region containing 70-72% A+T. The deduced amino acid sequence of CLAP cDNA revealed two domains which were very similar to domains in fasciclin I and other cell adhesion proteins. The nucleotide sequences of clones 1 and 2 have been entered into the NCBI database (AY307377 and AY462276). This study supports the view that the noncatalytic subunit of the heterodimeric cysteine protease in Artemia stabilizes cathepsin L at various pH and temperatures normally inconsistent with cathepsin L from other organisms, and that CLAP serves as a docking mechanism for cathepsin L at nonlysosomal sites in Artemia embryos.",European journal of biochemistry,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D001156', 'D001483', 'D020134', 'D056668', 'D002403', 'D015816', 'D017124', 'D003546', 'D018076', 'D019281', 'D029721', 'D004591', 'D004625', 'D006863', 'D007525', 'D007527', 'D008969', 'D017434', 'D021122', 'D013696']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Artemia', 'Base Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cathepsin L', 'Cathepsins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dimerization', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Isoenzymes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Subunits', 'Temperature']",Characterization of a cathepsin L-associated protein in Artemia and its relationship to the FAS-I family of cell adhesion proteins.,"[None, None, 'Q000196', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000235', 'Q000737', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000201', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'embryology', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'genetics', 'chemistry', 'genetics', None, 'chemistry', None, 'enzymology', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15479230,2005

The visible bands were then excised from the gel, and following trypsin digestion of the reduced and alkylated WSSV proteins in the bands, the peptide sequence of each fragment was determined by liquid chromatography-nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-nanoESI-MS/MS) using a quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Comparison of the resulting peptide sequence data against the nonredundant database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information identified 33 WSSV structural genes, 20 of which are reported here for the first time. Since there were six other known WSSV structural proteins that could not be identified from the SDS-PAGE bands, there must therefore be a total of at least 39 (33 + 6) WSSV structural protein genes. Only 61.5% of the WSSV structural genes have a polyadenylation signal, and preliminary analysis by 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends suggested that some structural protein genes produced mRNA without a poly(A) tail.

Protein rich food like shrimps contain reasonable amounts of non-protein bound Trp (100 mg/kg). In order to detect the treatment of shrimps with gamma-irradiation a method for the determination of OH-Trp in gamma-irradiated shrimps was developed. After homogenization, squeezing of shrimp samples and protein precipitation, a two-step-SPE-clean up was performed using a C18-cartridge and a propylsulfonic acid cation-exchange SPE followed by HPLC analysis with electrochemical detection (750 mV). Results showed that 5-OH-Trp contents in shrimp samples increased with applied doses up to 3 kGy and then decreased with higher doses. Other OH-Trp isomers were not detectable in the irradiated shrimps. Similarly no formation of 4-, 6-, and 7-OH-Trp was detected in model solutions containing the same amino acid composition as in shrimps. This indicates a suppression of the reaction of OH-radicals with Trp by the 300 fold molar excess of other amino acids acting as well as radical scavengers.

12730414,"Choline is important for normal membrane function, acetylcholine synthesis and methyl group metabolism; the choline requirement for humans is 550 mg/d for men (Adequate Intake). Betaine, a choline derivative, is important because of its role in the donation of methyl groups to homocysteine to form methionine. In tissues and foods, there are multiple choline compounds that contribute to total choline concentration (choline, glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin). In this study, we collected representative food samples and analyzed the choline concentration of 145 common foods using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Foods with the highest total choline concentration (mg/100 g) were: beef liver (418), chicken liver (290), eggs (251), wheat germ (152), bacon (125), dried soybeans (116) and pork (103). The foods with the highest betaine concentration (mg/100 g) were: wheat bran (1339), wheat germ (1241), spinach (645), pretzels (237), shrimp (218) and wheat bread (201).

12496430,"Shellfish are a common cause of adverse food reactions in hypersensitive individuals and shrimp is one of the most frequently reported causes of allergic reactions. A novel allergen from Penaeus monodon, designated Pen m 2, was identified by two-dimensional immunoblotting using sera from subjects with shrimp allergy, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the peptide digest. This novel allergen was then cloned and the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence. The cloned cDNA encoded a 356-aa protein with an acetylated N terminus at Ala2, identified by postsource decay analysis. Comparison of the Pen m 2 sequence with known protein sequences revealed extensive similarity with arginine kinase (EC 2.7.3.3) from crustaceans. Pen m 2 was purified by anion exchange chromatography and shown to have arginine kinase activity and to react with serum IgE from shrimp allergic patients and induce immediate type skin reactions in sensitized patients. Using Pen m 2-specific antisera and polyclonal sera from shrimp-sensitive subjects in a competitive ELISA inhibition assay, Pen m 2 was identified as a novel cross-reactive Crustacea allergen.

12237419,"The primary structure of a novel envelope protein from shrimp white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) was characterized using a combination of SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The resulting amino acid sequence matched an open reading frame (ORF), ORF1050, of the WSSV genome ORF database. ORF1050 contained 843 nt, encoding 281 aa, and was termed the vp281 gene. Computer-assisted analysis showed that both the vp281 gene and its product shared no significant homology with other known viruses. However, they shared striking identity/similarity with another WSSV structural protein, VP292, at both the nucleotide and amino acid sequence level, suggesting that vp281 and vp292 might have evolved by gene duplication from a common ancestral gene. WSSV VP281 cDNA was cloned into a pET32a(+) expression vector containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter to produce (His)(6)-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21. Specific mouse antibodies were raised using the purified fusion protein (His)(6)-VP281. Western blot analysis showed that the mouse anti-(His)(6)-VP281 antibodies bound specifically to VP281 of WSSV, without cross-reactivity with VP292. The transmission electron microscope immunogold-labelling method was used to localize VP281 in the WSSV virion as an envelope protein.

Twenty four PCB congeners from tri- to octa-chlorinated isomers were detected and quantified using conventional gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD). The aim of this study was to investigate the concentrations of PCBs in freshwater organisms from a shallow lake of Argentina. Stems of bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus), whole tissues of false loosestrife (Ludwigia sp.) and grass shrimp (Palaemonetes argentinus), and liver, gonads, muscle and mesenteric fat (if present) of fish species (Rhamdia sapo) and (Oligosarcus jenynsi) were analyzed. Two areas were selected to macrophytes sampling: the input area, main PCB source of the lake (Station 1), and the output area, a potential anoxic zone (Station 2). Macrophytes from Station I bioconcentrated higher total PCB levels than Station 2, showing that the former have received PCBs washed down from upstream areas. Penta- and hexa-congeners were enriched relative to other congeners in animal biota and macrophytes from Station 1, consistent with commercial mixture of Aroclor 1254 used in this region. In bulrush from Station 2 a predominance of tri- and tetra-chlorinated congeners was observed. Grass shrimp showed the lowest PCB values among animal biota. PCB concentrations in fish tissues varied with the species and the gonadal development. Mesenteric fat, only present in post-spawning organisms of R. sapo, had the highest values of PCBs relative to other tissues. A clearance of total PCBs in ovaries of post-spawning females of R. sapo was observed, but not in testes. O. jenynsil P. argentinus biomagnification factor (BMF) had a mean value of 18.7. Congeners 44, 52 and 151, showed the highest BMF values, being 64, 66 and 62, respectively. These values would be a consequence of the low depuration rate of 44 and 52 congeners with orthochlorine substitution conducted by O. jenynsi and the high depuration rate of congener 151, which lacks 4 4'- chlorine substitution, carried out by grass shrimp.

Among the OC pesticides, lindane was most dominant in the soil (32.6 ng/g dry wt in the upper and 173.9 ng/g dry wt in the lower horizon) and bulrush (1.9 pg/g lipid). Macrophyte also accumulated high levels of heptachlor epoxide (1.5 pg/g lipid). Heptachlor, although present in the soil, was below the detection limit in all aquatic biota studied. Its primary degradation product, heptachlor epoxide, was found in both soil and biota samples. DDT was found at low levels in the surface soil (6.8 ng/g dry wt), but at higher concentrations in fish (3.6 pg/g lipid), although levels were still below permissible levels for human consumption.

11755065,"Allometric, or disproportionate, growth of body parts is a basic problem in morphogenesis. Male spider crabs, Libinia emarginata, have several forms or morphotypes. During the terminal molt, the propodus enlarges disproportionately, exceeding the carapace length by as much as 35%. Even though shorter clawed males are reproductive, the large-clawed males become primary reproductives. We stimulated penultimate stage males to molt by eyestalk ablation, which removes molt inhibiting hormone (MIH) and mandibular organ inhibiting hormone (MIOH), and measured ecdysones by radioimmunoassay and methyl farnesoate (MF) in hemolymph by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an internal standard. Eyestalk ablation accelerated molting and increased ecdysteroids to peak at 150 ng/ml before the molt. In control animals the ecdysteroids peaked at 90 ng/ml 3 days before the molt, with MF remaining less than 0.5 ng/ml. These became large males with large allometric claws. In contrast, the ablated ones, with increased MF (1 to 1.5 ng/ml), increased carapace size, but retained shorter non-allometric claws, with length shorter than the carapace. The results are consistent with experiments that we have performed with MF administration (Abdu et al., Biol. Bull., Woods Hole, MA 195 (1998) 112; Laufer et al., Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 111 (1998) 113; Laufer et al., in: IV Symp. Aquaculture in Central America: Focusing on Shrimp and Tilapia, (1997a), p. 161; Laufer et al., Invert. Reprod. Dev. 31 (1997b) 63) which led to the interpretation that ecdysteroids and low MF concentrations promote allometric growth, while ecdysones with relatively higher concentrations of MF inhibited allometric growth. These results indicate and support the conclusion that MF and ecdysteroids determine the control of morphogenesis in allometric growth of Crustacea.",Insect biochemistry and molecular biology,"['D000818', 'D003386', 'D004441', 'D005231', 'D008297', 'D009024']","['Animals', 'Brachyura', 'Ecdysterone', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Male', 'Morphogenesis']",Evidence that ecdysteroids and methyl farnesoate control allometric growth and differentiation in a crustacean.,"[None, 'Q000033', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None]","[None, 'anatomy & histology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11755065,2002
11358181,"Dioxins/furans are ubiquitous environmental contaminants whose primary route of human exposure occurs via the consumption of fatty foods of animal origin. The US FDA conducted a market basket survey of dairy products and commercial fish and shellfish to obtain data on levels of 17 dioxin/furan congeners (2, 3, 7, 8-congeners) in the US. The dairy products sampled included various cheeses (American, cheddar, Swiss, cottage), ice cream, yogurt, butter, and milk. The finfish and shellfish (molluscs and crustacea) sampled are those marine species consumed in the greatest amounts and include canned tuna, shrimp, cod, blue crab, and oysters. Catfish was sampled because it is the dominant aquaculture species. Samples were collected in 1995/96 and analysis for 17 dioxin/furan congeners was performed by high-resolution gas chromatography following extraction and clean-up. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for each congener in each food were reported. Point estimates of exposure were calculated using a 3-day (1-day diary plus 2-day recall) food consumption survey for eaters-only and for the general population (USDA/CSFII, 1989-92). Toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) were used to derive overall dioxin/furan toxicity equivalents (TEQ) for each sample food. Mean estimates of TEQ exposure for each food were derived using five values for non-detects (ND = 0; ND = 1/2 LOD or LOQ, ND = LOD or LOQ) on both a total sample and eaters-only basis. Using zero and the LOD provide lower and upper bounds on the range of estimated exposure, respectively. The bounds on mean dioxin intakes (pg/person/day) calculated for consumers of specific foods were estimated as follows (using zero or LOD for non-detects): butter (0.5-11), cheese (1.6-3.2), ice cream (4-19), yogurt (0.8-28), catfish (148-150), fish (other than catfish) (0.03-9), crustacea (32-35), mollusks (16.1-16.6), and shrimp (0.09-4.5).

Shrimp heat-stable protein (HSP) was isolated and gamma irradiated at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 kGy in the condition of solution (1 mg/ml), and fresh shrimp was also irradiated. Conformational change of irradiated HSP was monitored by means of spectrometric measures, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with mouse monoclonal antibody, or human patients' sera and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ability of the immunoglobulin E of patients allergic to shrimp to bind to irradiated HSP was dose dependently reduced. The amount of intact HSP in an irradiated solution was reduced by gamma irradiation, depending on the dose.

Sugars with 1 to 8 degrees of polymer (DP) were found in this chitooligosaccharide mixture, and the weight percentage of sugars with DP > or = 6 was 44.3%. Minimal lethal concentrations of this mixture against Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in nutrient broth were 5 to 29 ppm, which were much lower than those of the chitosan reactant (50 to 1,000 ppm). The antibacterial activity of this mixture in the sterilized milk against E. coli O157, L. monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, and S. aureus was much stronger at 4 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. When raw milk was supplemented with either 0.24% or 0.48% (wt/vol) of this oligosaccharide mixture and stored at 4 degrees C for 12 days, its mesophilic and psychrotrophic counts were reduced by at least 3 log cycles, and there was very little change in pH.

The composited shrimp is extracted with basic ethyl acetate, followed by an acetonitrile-basic ethyl acetate mixture. This extract is centrifuged, filtered, evaporated, and reconstituted in water; the reconstituted extract is acidified, defatted with hexane, and passed through a propylsulfonic acid (PRS) and C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) system. The C18 SPE column is eluted with methanol, and the PRS SPE column is eluted with basic MeOH plus counter ion. The combined eluates are evaporated, reconstituted in acetonitrile, and derivatized with Sylon BFT. After derivatization, the addition of toluene directly to the sample, followed by the addition of basic water, quenches the derivatization process. After centrifugation, the organic layer is carefully removed, and the analytes are determined by GC with electron capture detection. Shrimp tissues were fortified with fenicols (i.e., CAP, FF, FFa, and TAP) at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 ng/mL.

The purified protein was coagulated by the shrimp hemocyte transglutaminase in the presence of Ca2+. The clottable protein contains 44% alpha helices and 26% beta sheets as determined by circular dichroism spectra. Its conformation is stable in buffer of pH 4-9. To solve its primary structure, partial sequences of the purified polypeptides from cyanogen bromide cleavage and endopeptidase digestion were also determined. A shrimp cDNA expression library was constructed. By combination with antibody screening, reverse transcriptase PCR using degenerate primers from determined amino acid sequences and cDNA library screening with digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes, the entire cDNA of 6124 bp was obtained. This cDNA encodes a protein of 1670 amino acids, including a 14-amino acid signal peptide. With four potential N-glycosylation sites, the clottable protein was found to contain 3.8% high-mannose glycan; and Man8GlcNAc and Man9GlcNAc were released upon endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase hydrolysis. Upon conducting a protein sequence database survey, the shrimp clottable protein shows 36% identities to the crayfish clotting protein and lower similarities to members of insect vitellogenins, apolipoprotein B and mammalian von Willebrand factor. Notably, a region rich in Gln residues, a polyGln motif and five Ser-Lys-Thr-Ser repeats are present in the shrimp protein, suggesting this protein might be a transglutaminase substrate.

A cDNA of slow-muscle Tm (sTm1), containing a complete open reading frame (ORF) and portions of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), encodes a protein of 284 amino acid residues with a predicted mass of 32,950, assuming acetylation of the amino terminus. The nucleotide sequence of a fast-muscle tropomyosin (fTm cDNA), which includes the entire ORF and part of the 3' UTR, is identical to that of sTm1 cDNA, except in the region encoding amino acid residues 39-80 (equivalent to exon 2 of mammalian and Drosophila muscle tropomyosin genes). The deduced amino acid sequences, which display the heptameric repeats of nonpolar and charged amino acids characteristic of alpha-helical coiled-coils, are highly homologous to tropomyosins from rabbit, Drosophila, and shrimp (57% to 99% identities, depending on species). Northern blot analysis showed that two transcripts (1.1 and 2.1 kb) are present in both fibre types. Mass spectrometry indicated that fast muscle contains one major isoform (fTm: 32,903), while slow muscle contains two major isoforms (sTm1 and sTm2: 32,950 and 32,884 respectively). Both Tm preparations contained minor species with a mass of about 32,830. Sequences of peptides derived from purified slow and fast Tms were identical to the deduced amino acid sequences of the sTm1 and fTm cDNAs, respectively, except in the C-terminal region of fTm. The difference in mass between that predicted by the deduced sequence (32,880) and that measured by mass spectrometry (32,903) suggests that fTm is posttranslationally modified, in addition to acetylation of the N-terminal methionine.

The cytosolic form contains copper and zinc (CuZnSOD), whereas the mitochondrial form contains manganese (MnSOD). The latter protein is synthesized in the cytosol as a MnSOD precursor, containing an N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting sequence. CuZnSOD is sensitive toward cyanide (CN) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but MnSOD is not. Assays for SOD activity in cytosol from the hepatopancreas of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, showed the presence of a CN/H2O2-insensitive form of SOD. No CN/H2O2-sensitive CuZnSOD was found. This unexpected phenomenon was shown to occur in all decapod crustacea (crabs, lobsters, shrimp) examined. The cytosolic and mitochondrial SODs of C. sapidus were purified by means of ion-exchange, size-exclusion, and reverse-phase HPLC. The cytosolic SOD is a homodimeric protein, which exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium (24 kDa left and right arrow 48 kDa). The protein contains approximately 1 Mn per subunit. No copper or zinc is present. Amino acid sequence analysis identified the novel cytosolic SOD as a MnSOD precursor with an abnormal mitochondrial-targeting sequence. The mitochondrial SOD of C. sapidus is similar to the MnSOD found in other eukaryotes. N-Terminal amino sequences of mitochondrial and cytosolic blue crab MnSOD differ in several positions.

Addition of SGh to incubation medium of shrimp YOs dose dependently reduced, within a few hours, ecdysteroid release into the medium. Moreover, inhibition by SGh decreases drastically in YOs from animals in late premolt stages, when there is maximal ecdysteroid production. Injection of SGh into shrimps evokes a hyperglycemic response maximal after 2 hr. Immunoadsorption of SGh with an anti-Homarus americanus cHHA antiserum inhibited both biological activities of the homogenate. After fractionation of acidic sinus gland extract by RP-HPLC, the maximal response in both bioassays was associated with the major UV absorbent peak, which was also the major immunoreactive peak when tested by ELISA with the anti-lobster cHHA.

Agents Chemother. 35:2486-2489, 1991) it was reported that two selected antibacterial agents, i.e., trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, can be efficiently bioencapsulated in nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana for administration to fish. This follow-up study showed that larvae of the sea bass and the turbot as well as postlarvae of the white shrimp accumulate the therapeutic agents in high quantities when fed medicated A. franciscana. To monitor their levels as a function of time, the liquid chromatographic method originally developed for the analysis of A. franciscana was modified with respect to chromatography, internal standardization, and sample pretreatment. The levels of trimethoprim ranged from 1 to 7 micrograms/g (sea bass), 1 to 13 micrograms/g (turbot), and 4 to 38 micrograms/g (white shrimp). The corresponding values for sulfamethoxazole were 0.3 to 4 micrograms/g (sea bass), 1 to 42 micrograms/g (turbot), and 4 to 35 micrograms/g (white shrimp). Only the two fish species, unlike the shrimp, metabolized the latter to N-acetylsulfamethoxazole (concentration range, 1 to 10 micrograms/g).

8029489,"Ciguatera toxins are odorless, tasteless, and generally undetectable by any simple chemical test; therefore, bioassays have traditionally been used to monitor suspect fish. Many native tests for toxicity in fish have been examined, including the discoloration of silver coins or copper wire or the repulsion of flies and ants, but all of these were rejected as invalid. Oral feeding of fish to cats or mongoose is a simple and relatively sensitive assay, but cats often regurgitate part of the meal. Feeding tests described above have been used in screening fish for toxicity, but they are cumbersome and nonquantitative. A mouse bioassay was developed; unfortunately, this procedure requires purification fish extracts, since mice are not very sensitive to ciguatoxin. An alternative to the use of mice is the mosquito bioassay, which was recently used to obtain a dose-response relationship between ingested ciguatoxin and clinical symptoms in man. This assay correlates reasonably well with cat and mouse bioassay. Many other bioassays have been developed using chicken, brine shrimp, and the guinea pig atrium. All traditional bioassays have one common disadvantage, the lack of specificity for individual toxins. Recent studies have also focused on the development of chemical methods, i.e., TLC and HPLC, for the detection and quantification of ciguatera-related toxins (okadaic acid and ciguatoxin and its analogs). Alternative assays based on immunochemical technology have been developed and show the greatest promise for use in seafood safety monitoring programs. For earlier methods (RIA and ELISA formats), liver extracts from ciguatoxic eels were used to prepare ciguatoxin antisera. The assay has been further adapted to a solid-phase immunobead assay (S-PIA), which has a very high potential for use as a marketplace screening tool to separate ciguateric fish. This assay can also be used to monitor reefs for ciguatera potential. Historically, attempts to validate methods used to measure ciguatera toxicity have been plagued with a lack of specificity and reference standards. These restrictions have been resolved, and a study is under way to evaluate the precision and accuracy of a low-cost, simplified field and laboratory S-PIA kit (Ciguatect, Hawaii Chemtect International, Pasadena, California, 91109), through an international interlaboratory trial using the AOAC/IUPAC validation mechanism.",Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D000818', 'D001681', 'D002273', 'D002851', 'D002922', 'D004988', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D019319', 'D012015', 'D012449']","['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Carcinogens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ciguatoxins', 'Ethers, Cyclic', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Reference Standards', 'Safety']",Evolution of methods for assessing ciguatera toxins in fish.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8029489,1994

18965614,"An analytical method based on microwave decomposition and flow injection analysis (FIA) coupled to hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HGAAS) is described. This is used to differentiate arsenite [As(III)], arsenate [As(V)], monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) from organoarsenic compounds usually present in seafood. Without microwave digestion, direct analysis of urine by HGAAS gives the total concentration of As(III), As(V), MMA and DMA because organoarsenic compounds such as arsenobetaine, usually found in most seafood, are not reducible upon treatment with borohydride and therefore cannot be determined by using the hydride generation technique. The microwave oven digestion procedure with potassium persulfate and sodium hydroxide as decomposition reagents completely decomposes all arsenicals to arsenate and this can be measured by HGASS. Microwave decomposition parameters were studied to achieve efficient decomposition and quantitative recovery of arsenobetaine spiked into urine samples. The method is applied to the determination of urinary arsenic and is useful for the assessment of occupational exposure to arsenic without intereference from excess organoarsenicals due to the consumption of seafood. Analysis of urine samples collected from an individual who ingested some seafood revealed that organoarsenicals were rapidly excreted in urine. After the ingestion of a 500-g crab, a 10-fold increase of total urinary arsenic was observed, due to the excretion of organoarsenicals. The maximum arsenic concentration was found in the urine samples collected approximately between 4 to 17 hr after eating seafood. However, the ingestion of organoarsenic-containing seafoods such as crab, shrimp and salmon showed no effect on the urinary excretion of inorganic arsenic, MMA and DMA.",Talanta,[],[],Determination of urinary arsenic and impact of dietary arsenic intake.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18965614,2009

The shrimp ribonucleic acid was extracted from boiled whole shrimp (Peneaus indicus), and was isolated by salt precipitation and sequential chromatography over DEAE-Sephacel and BioGel P-100. The allergenic material was identified as a ribonucleic acid based on the following criteria: a maximal absorption at 258 nm, failure to stain positively with Coomassie Brilliant Blue on slab gel electrophoresis, positive staining with ethidium bromide, co-migration with yeast tRNA on submerged gel electrophoresis in 1.5% Agarose M, and sensitivity to ribonuclease T2 and 0.3 M NaOH. Treatment with protease did not alter its allergenic activity. The RNA was capable of binding allergen-specific IgE in sera from two shrimp-sensitive patients, as demonstrated by microELISA and solid-phase radioimmunoassay (SPRIA) using antigen-coated nitrocellulose filter paper discs and purified 125I-labeled goat anti-human IgE. RNA isolated from shrimp by a conventional tRNA isolation procedure also had the ability to specifically bind IgE in the sera of shrimp-sensitive patients. IgE antibodies to shrimp RNA did not recognize yeast tRNA or salmon testes DNA, and were not detected in sera of other subjects. The shrimp-derived RNA was further able to induce a reaginic response in mice. A combination of in vitro aminoacylation of shrimp tRNA and SPRIA resulted in the identification of the allergenic tRNA as tRNA(Tyr) and tRNA(Arg).

Artemia microsomes catalyze the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to a lipid acceptor. After extraction of labeled lipids with either chloroform:methanol (2:1) or chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3), labeled compounds could be purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel. Mild acid hydrolysis of 3H-N-acetylglucosamine labeled material soluble in chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3) yielded a series of oligosaccharides ranging from 2 to about 8 glycosyl units in size. The larger components were shown to be sensitive to chitinase digestion but resistant to treatment with alpha-mannosidase.

High-resolution mass spectroscopy from a heated probe yielded a spectrum corresponding to tetramethylarsonium (AsMe4+); the authentic ion, however, had TLC and ion-exchange behavior different from that of the natural product. Infrared spectrometry likewise produced conflicting or uninterpretable data. Decomposition of the compound for analytical purposes was accomplished by dry ashing under oxidizing conditions.

Selection of column combinations was based on the requirements to resolve the higher MW fraction of chitosan and to give a linear calibration curve within the required MW range. The best combination of glass pore sizes and column lengths in two foot sections joined sequentially was: 2500 A (2 ft.), 1500 A (4 ft.), 550 A (6 ft.), 250 A (2 ft), 100 A (2 ft.), and 40 A (2 ft.). A loading study showed that an injection load of 500 mug, i.e. 100 mul at 5 g/l or 50 mul at 10 g/l (w/v), was the optimal load to give reproducible elution volumes, precision in quantitation, and minimum viscosity effects. The best calibration curve using defined dextran standards was obtained from the geometric mean of Mw (weight average MW) and Mn (number average MW) values and peak elution volumes. Precision in determining MW distribution of chitosan as well as dextran standards was better than 5% relative standard deviation, and the differences between these results and the manufacturer's data on the dextran standards were 6 to -17%.

1173811,"A method is described for the determination of total cholesterol in multicomponent foods and also other products such as nonfat dry milk, dried whole egg solids, and certain candy bars. The lipid is extracted from the sample by a mixed solvent and saponified. The unsaponifiable fraction which contains the cholesterol and other sterols is extracted with benzene. An aliquot is evaporated to dryness and the residue is dissolved in dimethylformamide. The sterols are derivatized to form trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers. The TMS-cholesterol derivative is quantitatively determined by gas-liquid chromatography, using 5alpha-cholestane as an internal standard. Nine laboratories participated in a collaborative study of the determination of total cholesterol in deviled ham sandwich spread, vegetable beef stew, corned beef hash, frozen chicken pot pie, pizza pepperoni, fish sticks, breaded shrimp, chocolate-covered candy bars, dried whole egg solids, and nonfat dry milk and the results are reported here.

4596748,"Shrimp refrigerated in a nitrogen atmosphere develop off-odors not typical of normal spoilage. Investigations of this phenomenon showed that hydrogen sulfide developed in the headspace gas, and a large percentage of the microbial population present on the shrimp stored in nitrogen was capable of hydrogen sulfide production, in contrast to the flora on shrimp stored in air. The predominant hydrogen sulfide-producing organism, Pseudomonas putrefaciens, was present in low numbers on fresh shrimp but usually reached high numbers by day 8 of nitrogen storage. Further studies revealed that cysteine and cystine were the probable substrates in shrimp utilized by this organism for hydrogen sulfide production. When shrimp sterilized by irradiation were inoculated with P. putrefaciens and incubated in an atmosphere of nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide and the characteristic off-odors developed.",Applied microbiology,"['D000388', 'D000693', 'D001431', 'D002452', 'D003545', 'D003553', 'D033364', 'D004888', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D005519', 'D006862', 'D009584', 'D009812', 'D011549', 'D012034', 'D012758', 'D013053']","['Air', 'Anaerobiosis', 'Bacteriological Techniques', 'Cell Count', 'Cysteine', 'Cystine', 'Decapoda', 'Erysipelothrix', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Food Preservation', 'Hydrogen Sulfide', 'Nitrogen', 'Odorants', 'Pseudomonas', 'Refrigeration', 'Shellfish', 'Spectrophotometry']",Hydrogen sulfide production by Pseudomonas putrefaciens in shrimp experimentally packed in nitrogen.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000302', None, None, None, 'Q000096', None, None, 'Q000302', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'isolation & purification', None, None, None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, 'isolation & purification', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4596748,1974

5105681,"Concentrations resulting in 50% mortality, determined with brine shrimp (Artemia salina L.) larvae exposed to known mycotoxins for 16 hr, were (mug/ml): aflatoxin G(1), 1.3; diacetoxyscirpenol, 0.47; gliotoxin, 3.5; ochratoxin A, 10.1; and sterigmatocystin, 0.54. 4-Acetamido-4-hydroxy-2-butenoic acid gamma-lactone gave no mortality at 10 mug/ml. Used as a screening system involving discs saturated with solutions of known mycotoxins, the larvae were relatively sensitive to aflatoxin B(1), diacetoxyscirpenol, gliotoxin, kojic acid, ochratoxin A, rubratoxin B, sterigmatocystin, stemphone, and T-2 toxin. Quantities of 0.2 to 2 mug/disc caused detectable mortality. The larvae were only moderately sensitive to citrinin, patulin, penicillic acid, and zearalenone which were detectable at 10 to 20 mug/disc. They were relatively insensitive to griseofulvin, luteoskyrin, oxalic acid, and beta-nitropropionic acid. The disc screening method indicated that 27 out of 70 fungal isolates from foods and feeds grown in liquid or solid media produced chloroform-extractable toxic material. Examination of toxic extracts by thin-layer chromatography for 17 known mycotoxins showed that the toxicity of eight isolates could be attributed to aflatoxin B(1) and B(2), kojic acid, zearalenone, T-2 toxin, or ochratoxin A. Nine out of 32 of these fungal isolates grown in four liquid media yielded toxic culture filtrates from at least one medium. Chemical tests for kojic, oxalic, and beta-nitropropionic acids showed the presence of one or two of these compounds in filtrates of seven of these nine isolates.",Applied microbiology,"['D001230', 'D001681', 'D002725', 'D002855', 'D003445', 'D003470', 'D005374', 'D005516', 'D005658', 'D005670', 'D007202', 'D007814', 'D008722', 'D003904', 'D009026', 'D009089', 'D009183', 'D010407', 'D012623', 'D012997']","['Aspergillus', 'Biological Assay', 'Chloroform', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Crustacea', 'Culture Media', 'Filtration', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fungi', 'Fusarium', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Larva', 'Methods', 'Mitosporic Fungi', 'Mortality', 'Mucor', 'Mycotoxins', 'Penicillium', 'Seawater', 'Solvents']",Brine shrimp (Artemia salina L.) larvae as a screening system for fungal toxins.,"['Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000254', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', None, None]","['metabolism', None, None, None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'growth & development', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5105681,1971
