35908143,"Nickel (Ni) is a widespread metal that occurs in food and drinking water from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Oral exposure to Ni can induce a variety of adverse effects; the European Food Safety Authority established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 13 μg/kg bw and a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) of 4.3 μg/kg bw to assess the risk of allergic reactions upon acute exposure. This study, the first conducted in Armenia, aimed to assess the dietary exposure of the adult Yerevan population (1272 subjects of both sexes) to Ni in a total diet study (TDS). Detection of Ni was carried out using atomic absorption spectrometry. To determine food consumption values, a 24-h recall survey was used. Following the K-means clustering test, two clusters were determined for food product intake. For the risk characterization of acute oral exposure, the margin of exposure (MOE) was calculated using both deterministic and probabilistic (Monte Carlo method) approaches. The average total exposure was 4.396 μg/kg bw, with limited influence by age and gender. The main contributors were ""fruits and vegetables"" followed by ""bread and flour-based products"": the total intake would be 5.11 μg/kg bw for a woman with high consumption of fruits and vegetables. Hence, the estimated chronic dietary exposure was below the TDI, irrespective of age and gender groups, and including high consumers. However, acute oral exposure estimates led to MOE values of less than 30 for most food products, indicating potential health concerns for Ni-sensitized individuals. The Monte Carlo approach indicated that the probability of occurrence of MOE lower than 30 was very high in the case of beef/veal, pork and chicken meat, eggs, and fish, alongside vegetable sources such as buckwheat, tomato, watermelon/melon, and potatoes. The findings prompt an investigation of Ni sources in the target foods in the Caucasus area.",Biological trace element research,[],[],Risk Characterization of the Armenian Population to Nickel: Application of Deterministic and Probabilistic Approaches to a Total Diet Study in Yerevan City.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35908143,2022
35885243,"Understanding how food processing may modify allergen bioaccessibility and the evolution of immunologically active peptides in the gastrointestinal tract is essential if knowledge-based approaches to reducing the allergenicity of food are to be realised. A soy-enriched wheat-based pizza base was subjected to in vitro oral-gastro-duodenal digestion and resulting digests analysed using a combination of sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (MS). The digestion profile of pizza base resembled that of bread crust where higher temperatures during baking reduced protein solubility but still resulted in the generation of a complex mixture of peptides. MS profiling showed numerous peptides carrying IgE epitopes, and coeliac toxic motifs were in excess of 20-30 residues long and were only released after either 120 min of gastric digestion or a combination of gastric and duodenal digestion. In silico prediction tools showed an overestimated number of cleavage sites identified experimentally, with low levels of atypical peptic and chymotryptic cleavage sites identified particularly at glutamine residues. These data suggest that such alternative pepsin cleavage sites may play a role in digestion of glutamine-rich cereal foods. They also contribute to efforts to provide benchmarks for mapping in vitro digestion products of novel proteins which form part of the allergenicity risk assessment.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],The Fate of IgE Epitopes and Coeliac Toxic Motifs during Simulated Gastrointestinal Digestion of Pizza Base.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35885243,2022

Selection tools that can be applied early in the breeding cycle are needed to accelerate genetic gain for increased wheat production while maintaining or improving grain quality if demand from human population growth is to be fulfilled. Proteomics screening assays of wheat flour can assist breeders to select the best performing breeding lines and discard the worst lines.

34206002,"Celiac disease is activated by digestion-resistant gluten peptides that contain immunogenic epitopes. Sourdough fermentation is a potential strategy to reduce the concentration of these peptides within food. However, we currently know little about the effect of partial sourdough fermentation on immunogenic gluten. This study examined the effect of a single sourdough culture (representative of those that the public may consume) on the digestion of immunogenic gluten peptides. Sourdough bread was digested via the INFOGEST protocol. Throughout digestion, quantitative and discovery mass spectrometry were used to model the kinetic release profile of key immunogenic peptides and profile novel peptides, while ELISA probed the gluten's allergenicity. Macrostructural studies were also undertaken. Sourdough fermentation altered the protein structure, in vitro digestibility, and immunogenic peptide release profile. Interestingly, sourdough fermentation did not decrease the total immunogenic peptide concentration but altered the in vitro digestion profile of select immunogenic peptides. This work demonstrates that partial sourdough fermentation can alter immunogenic gluten digestion, and is the first study to examine the in vitro kinetic profile of immunogenic gluten peptides from sourdough bread.",Nutrients,"['D000941', 'D001939', 'D002446', 'D004063', 'D000939', 'D005285', 'D005983', 'D006801', 'D010455', 'D059748', 'D014908']","['Antigens', 'Bread', 'Celiac Disease', 'Digestion', 'Epitopes', 'Fermentation', 'Glutens', 'Humans', 'Peptides', 'Proteolysis', 'Triticum']",A Case Study of the Response of Immunogenic Gluten Peptides to Sourdough Proteolysis.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000178', None, None, None, 'Q000276', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'analysis', 'diet therapy', None, None, None, 'immunology', None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206002,2021

As the interactions of lactic acid bacteria with yeast is a key event in sourdough fermentation, we wished to investigate how yeast affects metabolism of lactic acid bacteria, thereby affecting protein degradation and antigenic response. In this study, three strains isolated from sourdough were selected for dough fermentation, namely Pediococcus acidilactici XZ31, Saccharomyces cerevisiae JM1 and Torulaspora delbrueckii JM4. The changes in dough protein during the fermentation process were studied. Protein degradation and antigenic response in dough inoculated with Pediococcus acidilactici XZ31 monoculture and co-culture with yeast were mainly evaluated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, ELISA and Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. The whole-genome transcriptomic changes in Pediococcus acidilactici XZ31 were also investigated by RNA sequencing. The results showed that water/salt soluble protein and Tri a 28/19 allergens content significantly decreased after 24 h fermentation. Co-culture fermentation accelerated the degradation of protein, and reduced the allergen content to a greater extent. RNA-sequencing analysis further demonstrated that the presence of yeast could promote protein metabolism in Pediococcus acidilactici XZ31 for a certain period of time.

In this study, the release to the oven of volatile compounds from five gluten-free breads (quinoa, teff and rice flours, and corn and wheat starches) and wheat bread during baking and toasting was measured in real-time using proton transfer reaction-time of flight-mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS). Baking showed different volatile release patterns that are described by bell-shaped curves, plateaus and exponential growths. Flour-based breads had the higher overall volatile release during baking, but also high ratios in the final bread, while starch-based breads showed high pyrazine releases due to moisture losses. Meanwhile, toasting promoted the release of volatile compounds from the bread matrix, but also the additional generation of volatiles from Maillard reaction and caramelisation.

The digestibility of these proteins, in isolation or when naturally present in the respective food matrix, has been evaluated with SDS-PAGE, LC-MS/MS and a spectrophotometric assay. Results from the food matrices showed lower extent of total protein GI digestion under simulated infant conditions, intermediate behaviour under fed state adult conditions and larger extent under fasted state adult conditions. This was also the case for isolated gliadin. However, isolated Ara h 1 only showed lower extent of proteolysis in the gastric phase under infant conditions, reaching a similar extent to both adult conditions over the course of the intestinal phase.

White bread was digested using the INFOGEST in vitro standardised digestion protocol from 0 to 240 min and subsequently analysed by SDS-PAGE, quantitative LC-MS/MS, untargeted LC-MS/MS and ELISA. The release profile of six gluten peptides was defined by quantitative LC-MS/MS; none were detected in the gastric phase, but rapidly peaked in the intestinal phase. These results were corroborated by the ELISA analysis. Untargeted proteomics identified 83 immunogenic peptides. Their qualitative concentrations were defined throughout digestion, demonstrating complex relationships through proteolysis.

The levels of metal(loid)s in 40 composite (120 sub-samples) injera samples, representing 4 types of market establishments in Addis Ababa, were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF). For ICP-MS analysis, the accuracy of the method was evaluated by the analysis of a certified reference material and recovery experiments. It was found that the correlations between the mean levels of Al and Fe and between Al and Mn in injera were highly significant (p < 0.001). It was also found that 1.5 fresh injeras would cover 48-75% of recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for Mg, 17-21% of RDA for K, 19-23% of RDA for Ca, and 60-72% of RDA for P for an adult group aged between 19 and 50.

31816892,"Wheat gluten proteins are responsible for the bread-making properties of the dough but also for triggering important gastrointestinal disorders. Celiac disease (CD) affects approximately 1% of the population in Western countries. The only treatment available is the strict avoidance of gluten in the diet. Interference RNA (RNAi) is an excellent approach for the down-regulation of genes coding for immunogenic proteins related to celiac disease, providing an alternative for the development of cereals suitable for CD patients. In the present work, we report a comparative study of the stimulatory capacity of seven low-gluten RNAi lines differing in grain gluten and non-gluten protein composition, relevant for CD and other gluten pathologies. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 35 patients with active CD were included in this study to assess the stimulatory response induced by protein extracts from the RNAi lines. Analysis of the proliferative response and interferon-gamma (INF-γ) release of PBMCs demonstrated impaired stimulation in response to all RNAi lines. The lower response was provided by lines with a very low content of α- and γ-gliadins, and low or almost devoid of DQ2.5 and p31-43 α-gliadin epitopes.

31732753,"An expressed HMW glutenin subunit Glu-Ay showed positive impacts on a range of wheat processing quality and yield traits. The grain protein compositions are significantly optimised for baking, resulting in a better breadmaking quality. The unique breadmaking properties of wheat flour are related to the quality and quantity of high-molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) present in the grain. In the current study, the silent 1Ay HMW-GS allele, present in most bread wheat cultivars, was replaced by the expressed 1Ay21* allele, which was introgressed into Australian bread wheat cultivar Lincoln by a backcrossing and selfing scheme. Stability of gene expression and the effect of the introgressed 1Ay21* subunit on protein composition, agronomic traits, flour functionality, and breadmaking quality were studied using BC4F5 grain grown in glasshouse and field. Field phenotyping and grain quality testing showed that the 1Ay21* gene conferred significant improvements to a range of traits, including an increase in grain protein content by up to 9%, UPP% by up to 24%, bread volume by up to 28%. The glasshouse experiment and one of the field trials showed positive 1Ay21* effects on yield, while one field trial showed one significant effects. This indicates that expression of the 1Ay21* gene has the potential of simultaneously increasing protein content and grain yield under certain environment.

The dough composition, thermal treatment applied during baking, low moisture, and high rate of consumption make biscuits important contributors to daily exposure to acrylamide in Western diets. Acrylamide was determined by LC-ESI-MS/MS in 80 commercial biscuits marketed in Spain. The mean acrylamide content was 343 μg kg-1 (from <20 to 2144 μg kg-1). Rye, teff and oat-based biscuits exhibited the highest content (2144, 1559 and 1424 μg kg-1, respectively). 70% of the samples were below the benchmark level established by the EU Regulation 2017/2158. Compared to our previous prospective study in 2007 on the Spanish market, acrylamide has experienced an important decline (45%) in wheat-based formulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies applied in the sector. However, when all samples were considered, a slight non-significant decrease (18%) was observed. This fact suggests that the reformulation of traditional recipes with innovative cereals and ingredients could increase the acrylamide content in biscuits despite the mitigation strategies applied.

The OAVs of most aroma compounds varied greatly between a rice and a wheat bread. In particular, 2-aminoacetophenone with a grape-like, medicinal aroma was characteristic for rice bread crumb and crust, while maltol was only relevant in wheat bread crust. Ehrlich pathway products varied in their concentration between the bread crumbs and were correlated with the contents of their corresponding free amino acid precursors in the flours and doughs. The analysis of rice flour revealed that only a few aroma compounds were retained in the bread. Consequently, the bread making process has a high relevance in aroma compound formation.

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) bread doughs were prepared using LAB strains belonging to different Lactobacillus species and changes in phenolic acid, carotenoid content and antioxidant capacity were evaluated. Two L. plantarum strains out of six were able to significantly increase carotenoid content in the dough, suggesting that a higher mobilization/solubilisation of these antioxidant compounds occurs.

We performed the first integrated proteome analysis of wheat glume and awn in response to water deficit. Water deficit caused a significant decrease in important agronomic traits and grain yield. A total of 120 and 77 differentially accumulated protein (DAP) spots, representing 100 and 67 unique proteins responsive to water deficit, were identified by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) in glumes and awns, respectively, of the elite Chinese bread wheat cultivar Zhongmai 175. The DAPs of both organs showed similar functional classification and proportion and were mainly involved in photosynthesis, detoxification/defense, carbon/energy metabolism, and proteometabolism. Comparative proteome analyses revealed many more drought-responsive DAP spots in glumes than in awns, which indicate that glumes underwent more proteome changes in response to water deficit. The main DAPs involved in photosynthesis and carbon metabolism were significantly downregulated, whereas those related to detoxification/defense and energy metabolism were markedly upregulated under water deficit.

30381010,"Due to favourable climate condition, Italy is a prominent producer of different wheat varieties. Several wheat baked goods are produced, but the most typical Italian foods, like pasta, pizza and bread, are made of durum and common wheat flour. Because of the great importance of wheat in the Italian food market, authenticity represents an essential quality parameter not only for the producers and regulatory bodies but also for consumers. The aim of our study was to test the effectiveness of an unconventional non-targeted method for the discrimination of Triticum species using direct analysis real time-high-resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS). For this purpose, 60 wheat samples including durum, common and hulled wheat varieties were collected over two consecutive harvest years. Chemometric evaluation revealed an optimal sample clustering according to the wheat species and the presence of 18 significant markers able to discriminate the groups. The discrimination power obtained is promising since the use of DART-HRMS can significantly reduce the analysis time compared to chromatographic techniques. A plausible future commercial and industrial scenario could see the application of this analytical approach especially to evaluate the risk of substitution of higher value wheat species with lower value flours.","Food additives & contaminants.

30230644,"In wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain yield and grain protein content are negatively correlated, making the simultaneous increase of the two traits challenging. Apart from genetic approaches, modification of nitrogen fertilization offers a feasible option to achieve this aim. In this study, a range of traits related to nitrogen-use efficiency in six Australian bread wheat varieties were investigated under different nitrogen treatments using 3-year multisite field trials. Changes in the individual storage protein composition were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. Our results indicated that wheat grain yield and grain protein content reacted similarly to nitrogen availability, with grain yield being slightly more sensitive than grain protein content, and that genotype is a vital determinant of grain protein yield. Measurement of the glutamine synthetase activity of flag leaves and developing grains revealed that high nitrogen availability prompted the participation of glutamine in biological processes. In addition, a more significant accumulation of gluten macropolymer was observed under the high-nitrogen treatment from 21 days post-anthesis, and the underlying mechanism was elucidated by a comparative proteomics study. A yeast two-hybrid experiment confirmed this mechanism. The results of this study revealed that peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) was SUMOylated with the assistance of small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 and that high nitrogen availability facilitated this connection for the subsequent protein polymerization.

30131141,"Although wheat endogenous lipids strongly impact bread quality, knowledge on their detailed distribution throughout the different stages of straight dough bread making is lacking. We here compared the lipid populations in hexane [containing free lipids (FLs)] and water-saturated butanol extracts [containing bound lipids (BLs)] of wheat flour, freshly mixed and fermented doughs, and bread crumb using high-performance liquid-chromatography [for nonpolar lipids, i.e. mainly free fatty acids (FFA) and triacylglycerols] and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (for polar lipids). Freshly mixed doughs had lower FL and higher BL levels than flour, a phenomenon referred to as lipid-binding. Furthermore, probably due to the disintegration of flour particles, the overall extractability of nonpolar lipids was higher in freshly mixed dough than in flour. Dough fermentation decreased the extractability of glycolipids, but increased that of nonpolar lipids and phospholipids. We hypothesize that these phenomena result from stretching of the gluten network due to gas cell expansion, which leads to the replacement of some lipids associated with gluten proteins by others. Baking increased the extractability of bound lysophospatidylcholine (LPC) levels, but decreased that of free FFA. This is probably due to in situ dissociation of amylose-LPC inclusion complexes and formation of amylose-FFA inclusion complexes during bread baking and cooling, respectively. The approach and ESI-MS/MS methodology we developed provided valuable insights regarding the distribution of lipids at the different stages of bread making.

These proteins are involved mainly in energy, N and protein metabolism, carbon metabolism, and starch biosynthesis. Subcellular localization prediction and fluorescence confocal microscopic analysis showed that the DAPs identified were localized mainly in the cytosol and chloroplast. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a greater proteomic difference among grain developmental periods than between the high-N and control groups. Protein-protein interaction analysis highlighted a complex network centered around enzymes involved in energy, N and protein metabolism, and starch biosynthesis.

To gain more specific information about the role of glutenins in wheat dough, the two major subunits of glutenin, high- and low-molecular-weight (HMW and LMW) glutenins, were extracted, isolated, and identified by mass spectrometry. Antibodies for HMW and LMW glutenins were developed using the proteomic information on the characterized glutenin subunits. The antibodies were found to be specific to each subunit by western immunoblots and were then conjugated to quantum dots (QDs) using site-click conjugation, a new method to keep antibody integrity.

The purified wEro1 monomer, which contained two conserved redox active motif sites, bound to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor with a molecular weight of ∼47 kDa. wEro1 catalyzed the reduction of both bound and free FAD, and its reduction activity of free FAD reached 7.8 U/mg. Moreover, wEro1 catalyzed the oxidation of dithiothreitol and wheat protein disulfide isomerase (wPDI). Both glutathione and the reduced ribonuclease could work as electron donors for wEro1 in catalyzing the oxidation of wPDI. Additionally, wEro1 supplementation improved the CSB qualities with an increased specific volume of CSB and decreased crumb hardness, which was attributed to water-insoluble wheat proteins increasing and gluten network strengthening.

Therefore, selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) was used. SIFT-MS is an easy-to-use and promising technique in the field of food and flavor analysis. Volatile compounds of crumb samples from the breads with sourdough were measured and compared with those of reference bread crumb samples. In general, sourdough addition had a positive effect on the concentrations of the volatile compounds measured by SIFT-MS. Furthermore, a trend toward higher concentrations of several volatiles was seen upon the addition of sourdoughs that were fermented up to 72h, compared to the addition of sourdoughs that were fermented for a shorter time. Ethanol was the major volatile compound identified tentatively, next to alcohols, aldehydes, esters, terpenes, and heterocyclic compounds. Also acetoin/ethyl acetate could be identified, but these compounds could not be distinguished. Higher alcohols showed an increase upon the use of sourdough fermented for a long time. High concentrations of acetic acid were found in breads made with Gluconobacter oxydans IMDO A845-initiated sourdough, indicating its potential for sourdough production.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) patterns indicated that ovalbumin was surprisingly not incorporated in glutenins by covalent bond, whereas size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography showed that glutenin macropolymer content in glutenins increased slightly. Furthermore, dynamic rheology experiments indicated ovalbumin led to a decrease inG' andG″ of dough. Based on molecular dynamic simulation and SDS-PAGE results, it was inferred that ovalbumin was not hydrolyzed by endopeptidases during dough fermentation and crosslinked to gluten proteins during steaming.

Deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (DON-3-glucoside) is a DON plant conjugate that is widely found in cereal products. As DON accumulation in the field seems unavoidable, it is important to investigate all of the conditions that affect its stability during food processing. One of the most consumed cereal product around the world is bread, however the published information about DON stability in bread shows a large variability of results because a huge amount of factors affect DON and its modified forms. So, the aim of this research was to study the fate of DON and its modified forms through the breadmaking process with the addition of xylanase and α-amylase at different fermentation temperatures. Moreover, different α-amylase and xylanase concentrations were added to the dough to be fermented. To quantify DON and its derived forms in the samples, liquid chromatography with double mass spectrophotometer was used. DON was reduced during fermentation and baking; however, the reduction at each step was related to the fermentation temperature. The presence of α-amylase and xylanase caused increases in DON during fermentation and during early baking. DON-3-glucoside was slightly reduced after fermentation and was widely increased (>80%) after baking. Deepoxy-deoxynivalenol (DOM-1) increased during the breadmaking process.

Moniliformin is extracted with water and quantified with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and its presence confirmed with liquid chromatography-Orbitrap-high-resolution mass spectrometry. The method was validated for flour, bread, pasta and maize samples in terms of linearity, matrix effect, recovery, repeatability and limit of quantification. Quantification was conducted by matrix-matched calibration. Positive samples were confirmed by standard addition. Recovery ranged from 77 to 114% and repeatability from 1 to 14%. The limit of quantification, defined as the lowest concentration tested at which the validation criteria of recovery and repeatability were fulfilled, was 10 μg/kg. The method was applied to 102 cereal-based food samples collected in the Netherlands and Germany. Moniliformin was not detected in bread samples. One of 22 flour samples contained moniliformin at 10.6 μg/kg. Moniliformin occurred in seven out of 25 pasta samples at levels around 10 μg/kg.

We carried out a proteomic study using the total grain proteins from two low-gliadin wheat lines, obtained by RNAi, and the untransformed wild type as reference. The impact of silencing on both target and on non-target proteins was evaluated. Because of the great protein complexity, we performed separate analyses of four kernel protein fractions: gliadins and glutenin subunits, and metabolic and CM-like proteins, by using a classical 2D electrophoresis gel based approach followed by RP-HPLC/nESI-MS/MS. As a result of the strong down-regulation of gliadins, the HMW-GS, metabolic and chloroform/methanol soluble proteins were over-accumulated in the transgenic lines, especially in the line D793, which showed the highest silencing of gliadins. Basing on these data, and considering that metabolic proteins and chloroform/methanol soluble proteins (CM-like), such as the α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor family, β-amylase and serpins, were related to wheat allergens, further in vivo analysis will be needed, especially those related to clinical trials in controlled patients, to determine if these lines could be used for food preparation for celiac or other gluten intolerant groups.",Journal of proteomics,"['D001939', 'D002851', 'D015180', 'D020868', 'D005903', 'D010940', 'D030821', 'D040901', 'D053719', 'D014908']","['Bread', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gliadin', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Proteomics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triticum']",Comparative proteomic analysis of two transgenic low-gliadin wheat lines and non-transgenic wheat control.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'analysis', None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28625740,2018

Mycotoxins are agricultural contaminants of fungal origin occurring at all latitudes worldwide and being characterized by acute and chronic effects on human health and animal wellness, depending on the species sensitivity. The major mycotoxins of food concern are aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A, the first for its toxicity, and the second for its recurrent occurrence.

28478307,"Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum (Desf.) Husn.) is an economically important crop used for the production of semolina, which is the basis of pasta and other food products. Its grains provide proteins and starch for human consumption. Grain development is a key process in wheat physiology; it is highly affected by a number of enzymes that control the metabolic processes governing accumulation of starch and storage proteins and ultimately grain weight. Most of these enzymes are present in the albumin/globulin grain fraction, which represents about a quarter of total seed proteins. With the aim to describe the dynamic profile of the albumin/globulin fraction during durum wheat grain development, we performed a proteomic analysis of this subproteome using a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based approach and compared six developmental stages. A total of 285 differentially (237 over- and 48 under-) represented spots was identified by nanoLC-ESI-LIT-MS/MS, which were associated with 217 non-redundant Triticum sequence entries. Quantitative protein dynamics demonstrated that carbon metabolism, energy, protein destination/storage, disease/defense and cell growth/division functional categories were highly affected during grain development, concomitantly with progressive grain size increase and starch/protein reserve accumulation. Bioinformatic interaction prediction revealed a complex network of differentially represented proteins mainly centered at enzymes involved in carbon and protein metabolism. A description of 18 proteins associated with wheat flour human allergies was also obtained; these components showed augmented levels at the last developmental stages.

The 33-mer peptide from α2-gliadin has frequently been described as the most important CD-immunogenic sequence within gluten. However, from more than 890 published amino acid sequences of α-gliadins, only 19 sequences contain the 33-mer. In order to make a precise assessment of the importance of the 33-mer, it is necessary to elucidate which wheat species and cultivars contain the peptide and at which concentrations. This paper presents the development of a stable isotope dilution assay followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantitate the 33-mer in flours of 23 hexaploid modern and 15 old common (bread) wheat as well as two spelt cultivars. All flours contained the 33-mer peptide at levels ranging from 91-603 μg/g flour. In contrast, the 33-mer was absent (<limit of detection) from tetra- and diploid species (durum wheat, emmer, einkorn), most likely because of the absence of the D-genome, which encodes α2-gliadins.

30645894,"The research is aimed at obtaining a concentrate of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in liposomal form and developing possible ways of PUFA application in manufacturing functional food products. The PUFA concentrate was obtained from the fat of the Baikal seal by method of complexing with urea. We prepared a liposomal form of PUFA concentrate by evaporating organic solvent from the solution of lipids to form a thin lipid film with addition of buffer solution and further extrusion of the obtained emulsion. We defined the size of liposomal particles by method of turbidimetry. We identified the fatty acid composition of the samples by gas-liquid chromatography using a chromatographymass spectrometer. Biomedical research was conducted on 30 adult male Wistar rats with initial weight of 130-150 g. We induced atherogenic experimental hyperlipemia in rats by adding 5% cholesterol, 0.3% of 6-methyl-2-thiouracil, 1% cholic acid and 5% of lard to their normal diet for 21 days. We used an automatic biochemical analyzer to define total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in blood serum. As a result of the experiment, we obtained a concentrate from the seal fat with content of essential PUFA 12.2% of total fatty acids in which the ratio of ω-6:ω-3 was 1.3:1. We obtained the liposomal form of the PUFA concentrate, with the average size of the liposomes ranging from 144 to 158 nm. We have established that the blood serum of the animals with induced hyperlipidemia, which orally took the liposomal form of PUFA concentrate for 14 days in a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight, showed the decrease of total cholesterol content of LDL and VLDL, while HDL increased to the parameters in intact animals. This indicated a normalization of the lipid profile in rats and the lipid-lowering effect of the concentrate. Also, we have studied the possibility of enriching wheat bread with essential fatty acids by replacing some part of the water with the liposomal form of PUFA concentrate. The use of this additive increased the output volume of bread by 14%, intensified the crust color and didn't affect the organoleptic indicators of bread quality. Fatty acid analysis of the lipids in bread showed that after adding 3 g of PUFA concentrate in liposome form per 100 g of flour increased the content of ω-3 PUFA by 3.2 fold (191 mg per 100 g of bread), with the ratio of ω-6:ω-3 PUFA being 5.8:1. Thus, bread enriched with PUFA concentrate in liposome form can be positioned as a functional food product that contains ω-3 PUFA in an amount of 19.1% of the recommended daily intake in 100 g of final product and also as a product with optimal PUFA ratio of ω-6:ω-3.",Voprosy pitaniia,[],[],[Development of liposomal form of polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrate: ways of using in production of functional foods].,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30645894,2019

As the complexity of the wheat genome is unravelled, determining how it is used to build the protein machinery of wheat plants is a key next step in explaining detailed aspects of wheat growth and development. The specific functions of wheat organs during vegetative development and the role of metabolism, protein degradation and remobilisation in driving grain production are the foundations of crop performance and have recently become accessible through studies of the wheat proteome. We present a large scale, publicly accessible proteome mapping of wheat consisting of 24 organ and developmental samples. Tissue specific sub-proteomes and ubiquitously expressed markers of the wheat proteome are identified, alongside hierarchical assessment of protein functional classes, their presence in different tissues and correlations between the abundance of functional classes of proteins. Gene-specific identifications and protein family relationships are accounted for in the organisation of the data and 202 new protein-coding transcripts identified by proteogenomic mapping.

A proper risk assessment of those substances requires the availability of robust occurrence data; in this respect concerns have been raised regarding the reliability of results obtained with the currently available methods to determine those substances in processed food. This article presents an indirect analytical procedure for the simultaneous determination of 3-MCPDEs, 2-MCPDEs and GEs in a wide variety of food products after extraction by pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) and determination by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). For the differentiation of MCPDEs and GEs, the latter were first converted to monobromopropanediol esters (MBPDEs) in acid aqueous solution of sodium bromide. MCPDEs and MBPDEs were then hydrolysed under acidic conditions followed by derivatisation of the released free (non-esterified) form in ethyl acetate with phenyl boronic acid (PBA). Quantification of the analytes was carried out using the isotopic labelled analogues of both MCPDEs and GEs. Limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) were in the range of 7-17mgkg(-1) and 13-31mgkg(-1) respectively, while the working range of the method was between LOQ and 1850mgkg(-1) expressed on fat basis.

27450514,"This study dealt with the influence of a crucial pH value of 4.0 on the microbiota of spontaneously fermented backslopped liquid wheat sourdoughs. Two spontaneously fermented wheat sourdough fermentation experiments were carried out, one without control of the pH and one with the pH kept constant at pH4.0, both during nine backslopping steps. In each case, two additional backslopping steps were carried out, with the pH kept constant at 4.0 and with free pH, respectively. Keeping the pH constant at 4.0 changed the microbial community dynamics and metabolite kinetics of the sourdough fermentations. A slower prevalence of sourdough-specific Kazachstania yeasts occurred. Nevertheless, in both experiments, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lb. plantarum/pentosus/paraplantarum, and Kazachstania exigua/bulderi/barnettii prevailed ultimately. The lactic acid and ethanol concentration profiles were affected positively by keeping the pH constant at a minimum of 4.0 as well as the l- and d-lactic acid ratio profile, a potential biological marker for sourdough stability and maturity.

By comparing the differentially accumulated proteins from two cultivars (UC1110 and PI 610750) and their derivatives, as well as the F10 recombinant inbred line population differing in cold-tolerance, a total of 20 common protein spots representing 16 unique proteins were successfully identified using 2-DE method. Of these, 14 spots had significantly enhanced abundance in the cold-sensitive parental cultivar UC1110 and its 20 descendant lines when compared with the cold-tolerant parental cultivar PI 610750 and its 20 descendant lines. Six protein spots with reduced abundance were also detected. The identified protein spots are involved in stress/defense, carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, energy metabolism, and photosynthesis. The 20 differentially expressed protein spots were chosen for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to investigate expression changes at the RNA level. The results indicated that the transcriptional expression patterns of 11 genes were consistent with their protein expression models. Among the three unknown proteins, Spot 20 (PAP6-like) showed high sequence similarities with PAP6. qRT-PCR results implied that cold and salt stresses increased the expression of PAP6-like in wheat leaves. Furthermore, VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing)-treated plants generated for PAP6-like were subjected to freezing stress, these plants had more serious droop and wilt, an increased rate of relative electrolyte leakage, reduced relative water content (RWC) and decreased tocopherol levels when compared with viral control plants. However, the plants that were silenced for the other two unknown proteins had no significant differences in comparison to the BSMV0-inoculated plants under freezing conditions.

Overall, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and Flame Ionization Detection revealed a wax coverage of flag leaf blades (16 μg/cm(2)) a third that of peduncles (49 μg/cm(2)). Flag leaf blade wax was dominated by 1-alkanols, while peduncle wax contained primarily β-diketone and hydroxy-β-diketones, thus suggesting differential regulation of the acyl reduction and β-diketone biosynthetic pathways in the two analyzed organs. The characteristic chain length distributions of the various wax compound classes are discussed in light of their individual biosynthetic pathways and biosynthetic relationships between classes. Along with previously reported wheat wax compound classes (fatty acids, 1-alkanols, 1-alkanol esters, aldehydes, alkanes, β-diketone, hydroxy-β-diketones, alkylresorcinols and methyl alkylresorcinols), esters of 2-alkanols and three types of aromatic esters (benzyl, phenethyl and p-hydroxyphenethyl) are also reported. In particular, 2-heptanol esters were identified. Detailed analyses of the isomer distributions within 1-alkanol and 2-alkanol ester homologs revealed distinct patterns of esterified acids and alcohols, suggesting several wax ester synthases with very different substrate preferences in both wheat organs.

27236463,"The use of sourdough fermented with specific strains of antifungal lactic acid bacteria can reduce chemical preservatives in bakery products. The main objective of this study was to investigate the production of antifungal carboxylic acids after sourdough fermentation of quinoa and rice flour using the antifungal strains Lactobacillus reuteri R29 and Lactobacillus brevis R2Δ as bioprotective cultures and the non-antifungal L. brevis L1105 as a negative control strain. The impact of the fermentation substrate was evaluated in terms of metabolic activity, acidification pattern and quantity of antifungal carboxylic acids. These in situ produced compounds (n=20) were extracted from the sourdough using a QuEChERS method and detected by a new UHPLC-MS/MS chromatography. Furthermore, the sourdough was applied in situ using durability tests against environmental moulds to investigate the biopreservative potential to prolong the shelf life of bread. Organic acid production and TTA values were lowest in rice sourdough. The sourdough fermentation of the different flour substrates generated a complex and significantly different profile of carboxylic acids. Extracted quinoa sourdough detected the greatest number of carboxylic acids (n=11) at a much higher concentration than what was detected from rice sourdough (n=9). Comparing the lactic acid bacteria strains, L. reuteri R29 fermented sourdoughs contained generally higher concentrations of acetic and lactic acid but also the carboxylic acids. Among them, 3-phenyllactic acid and 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid were present at a significant concentration. This was correlated with the superior protein content of quinoa flour and its high protease activity. With the addition of L. reuteri R29 inoculated sourdough, the shelf life was extended by 2 days for quinoa (+100%) and rice bread (+67%) when compared to the non-acidified controls. The L. brevis R2Δ fermented sourdough bread reached a shelf life of 4 days for quinoa (+100%) and rice (+33%). However, the shelf life was similar to the chemically acidified control indicating that the preservation effect of the carboxylic acids seems to have a minor contribution effect on the antifungal activity in gluten-free breads.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D019342', 'D000935', 'D061046', 'D001939', 'D002208', 'D027465', 'D005285', 'D005433', 'D005520', 'D061353', 'D005658', 'D007773', 'D019344', 'D007778', 'D012275', 'D053719']","['Acetic Acid', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Biological Control Agents', 'Bread', 'Caproates', 'Chenopodium quinoa', 'Fermentation', 'Flour', 'Food Preservatives', 'Food Storage', 'Fungi', 'Lactates', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lactobacillus', 'Oryza', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Antifungal sourdough lactic acid bacteria as biopreservation tool in quinoa and rice bread.,"['Q000378', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000382', 'Q000378', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None]","['metabolism', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'microbiology', 'metabolism', 'microbiology', None, 'microbiology', 'pharmacology', None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27236463,2017

Seven healthy men followed a week-long low-fiber diet (17 g/d) and HFD (44 g/d) in a randomized crossover design. A test meal containing 50 g of the available carbohydrates from wheat bread was served as breakfast after each week. Alveolar exhaled breath samples were analyzed at fasting state and 30, 60, and 120 minutes after this meal parallel to plasma glucose, insulin, and serum lipids. We used solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for detecting changes in 15 VOCs.

27041305,"An alternative method to quantify 40 volatile compounds in wheat bread crumb is proposed. It consists of a Soxhlet extraction with a mixture of dichloromethane and diethyl ether containing lipases and a subsequent concentration with Vigreux column. It is the first time that lipases are added to transform the fat into free fatty acids and glycerol, which elute at the end of the chromatogram after the analytes, avoiding problems in the chromatography due to fat residues, such as dirtiness in the injector, column clogging or overlapping peaks. The extract is most easily analysed by GC/MS, using a standard addition method to correct matrix effect.

In total, 138 and 127 differentially expressed protein (DEP) spots representing 116 and 113 unique DEPs were identified in the embryo and endosperm, respectively. Among them, 54 (31%) DEPs were commonly present in both organs while 62 (35%) and 59 (34%) DEPs occurred only in the embryo and endosperm, respectively. Embryonic DEPs are primarily stress-related proteins and involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, while those from the endosperm are related primarily to carbohydrate metabolism and storage. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the proteome differences in the endosperm caused by different cultivars were greater than those by development stages, while the differences in the embryo showed the opposite pattern. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed a complex network centered primarily on enzymes involved in carbohydrate and protein metabolism. The transcriptional levels of fourteen important DEPs encoding genes showed high similarity between organs and cultivars. In particular, some key DEPs of the endosperm, such as phosphoglucomutase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), and sucrose synthase (SUS), showed significantly upregulated expression, indicating their key roles in starch biosynthesis and grain yield.

The objective of this study was to link LMW-GS genes and haplotypes characterized using well known Glu-A3, Glu-B3, and Glu-D3 gene-specific primers to their protein products in a single wheat variety. A total of 36 LMW-GS genes and pseudogenes were amplified from the Korean cultivar Keumkang. These include 11 Glu-3 gene haplotypes, two from the Glu-A3 locus, two from the Glu-B3 locus, and seven from the Glu-D3 locus. To establish relationships between gene haplotypes and their protein products, a glutenin protein fraction was separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) and 17 protein spots were analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). LMW-GS proteins were identified that corresponded to all Glu-3 gene haplotypes except the pseudogenes.

26765256,"High molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) are important seed storage proteins in wheat (Triticum aestivum) that determine wheat dough elasticity and processing quality. Clarification of the defined effectiveness of HMW-GSs is very important to breeding efforts aimed at improving wheat quality. To date, there have no report on the expression silencing and quality effects of 1Bx20 and 1By20 at the Glu-B1 locus in wheat. A wheat somatic variation line, AS208, in which both 1Bx20 and 1By20 at Glu-B1 locus were silenced, was developed recently in our laboratory. Evaluation of agronomic traits and seed storage proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) indicated that AS208 was highly similar to its parental cultivar Lunxuan987 (LX987), with the exception that the composition and expression of HMW-GSs was altered. The 1Bx20 and 1By20 in AS208 were further identified to be missing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Based on the PCR results for HMW-GS genes and their promoters in AS208 compared with LX987, 1Bx20 and 1By20 were speculated to be deleted in AS208 during in vitro culture. Quality analysis of this line with Mixograph, Farinograph, and Extensograph instruments, as well as analysis of bread-making quality traits, demonstrated that the lack of the genes encoding 1Bx20 and 1By20 caused various negative effects on dough processing and bread-making quality traits, including falling number, dough stability time, mixing tolerance index, crude protein values, wet gluten content, bread size, and internal cell structure. AS208 can potentially be used in the functional dissection of other HMW-GSs as a plant material with desirable genetic background, and in biscuit making industry as a high-quality weak gluten wheat source.

26717969,"The conversion of parent free amino acids into alcohols by an enzymatic deamination, decarboxylation, and reduction caused by microbial enzymes was first reported more than 100 years ago and is today known as the Ehrlich pathway. Because the chiral center at the carbon bearing the methyl group in l-isoleucine should not be prone to racemization during the reaction steps, the analysis of the enantiomeric distribution in 2-methylbutanal, 2-methylbutanol, and 2-methylbutanoic acid as well as in the compounds formed by secondary reactions, such as ethyl 2-methylbutanoate and 2-methylbutyl acetate, are an appropriate measure to follow the proposed degradation mechanism in the Ehrlich reaction. On the basis of a newly developed method for quantitation and chiral analysis, the enantiomers of the five metabolites were determined in a great number of fermented foods. Whereas 2-methylbutanol occurred as pure (S)-enantiomer in nearly all samples, a ratio of almost 1:1 of (S)- and (R)-2-methylbutanal was found. These data are not in agreement with the literature suggesting the formation of 2-methylbutanol by an enzymatic reduction of 2-methylbutanal. Also, the enantiomeric distribution in 2-methylbutanoic acid was closer to that in 2-methylbutanol than to that found in 2-methylbutanal, suggesting that also the acid is probably not formed by oxidation of the aldehyde as previously proposed. Additional model studies with (S)-2-methylbutanal did not show a racemization under the conditions of food production or during workup of the sample for volatile analysis. Therefore, the results establish that different mechanisms might be responsible for the formation of aldehydes and acids from the parent amino acids in the Ehrlich pathway.

Experiment was carried out on male Wistar rats with initial weight 140-180 g. After a quarantine during the preparatory period rats for 14 days were accustomed to the partial (50%) replacement of the standard diet by bakery products with standard compound­ing. Then, 7 groups of rats were formed: the 1st group of rats (control group, n=10) continued to receive bakery products of a standard composition; groups with the 2nd on 7th (experimental, n=8 in everyone) received enriched bakery products: the 2nd group - with blueberry powder; the 3rd group - with mountain ash powder; the 4th group - with sea-buckthorn powder; the 5th group - with flour of a pine nut; the 6th group - with rice bran oil; the 7th group - with pumpkin oil. The intensity of free radical oxidation and antioxidant activity (by chemiluminescence method), activity of superoxide dismutase and level of secondary oxidation products reacted with thiobarbituric acid (by spectrophotometry) were monitored in rat blood serum. It has been shown that the use of bakery products with different compounding in the animal diet had different effects on indicators of prooxidant-antioxidant system of blood serum. Bakery products containing sea buckthorn pomace powder, flour of pine nut and rice bran oil reduced intensity of free radical oxidation in rat blood serum by 36.0, 24.6 and 18.8%, respectively.

The Method Developer evaluation for the validation of the GlutenTox Pro Test Kit (Biomedal Diagnostics, Sevilla, Spain) for the detection of gluten in foods and on surfaces was conducted at Biomedal, S. L., Camas, Sevilla, Spain. The GlutenTox Pro test method was evaluated by testing the following: cross-reactivity, interference, specificity and sensitivity, robustness, stability, lot-to-lot variation, food matrix, and environmental surface. To evaluate the performance of the GlutenToxPro test for the detection of gluten, 10 matrixes were selected: rice flour, bread/biscuit, rolled oat, pâté, and yogurt (and a second bread matrix for incurred sampled testing) for the food matrix study and food-grade painted wood, plastic, rubber, sealed ceramic, and stainless steel for the environmental surface matrix study. For the food matrix study, 30 replicates were evaluated at six spiked levels of gluten (0, 3, 8, 15, 25, and 45 ppm) against four detection thresholds (5, 10, 20, and 40 ppm) for each food matrix. Additionally, 10 replicates were evaluated at a concentration of 10,000 ppm using all four detection thresholds only for rice flour matrix. Three replicates of each concentration level of gluten were analyzed using paired samples by the AOAC OMA 2012.01 reference method for each food matrix. For the environmental surface study, 30 replicates were evaluated at a low spike level of gluten (16 ng/16 cm2), five replicates at a high spike level of gluten (400 ng/16 cm2), and five replicates at an unspiked control level (0 ng/16 cm2) for each surface matrix. Upon completion of testing, the probability of detection values and confidence intervals were calculated and plotted versus the concentration level as determined by the reference method when applicable. An independent laboratory evaluation of the GlutenTox Pro Test Kit with rice flour and stainless steel environmental surface was conducted at Q Laboratories, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH).

In this context, a targeted proteomic approach based on liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) technique was proposed to assess the presence of celiotoxic cereals, namely wheat, oats, barley and rye, in raw and processed food products. To this aim, unique marker peptides were properly selected in order to distinguish between the different cereal types. A revised cocktail solution based on reducing and denaturing agents was exploited for prolamin extraction from raw and processed food; in addition, defatting with hexane was carried out for sample clean-up, allowing to largely reduce problems related to matrix effect. Method validation on fortified rice flour showed good analytical performance in terms of sensitivity (limits of detection in the 2-18 mg kg(-1) range). However, poor trueness was calculated for self-made incurred bread (between 3 and 30% depending on the peptide), probably due to baking processes, which reduce gluten extractability. Thus, it is evident that in the case of processed foods further insights into sample treatment efficiency and reference materials for protein calibration are required to obtain accurate gluten determination.

Here, we report the effectiveness of seven plasmid combinations, encompassing RNAi fragments from α-, γ-, ω-gliadins, and LMW glutenin subunits, for silencing the expression of different prolamin fractions. Silencing patterns of transgenic lines were analysed by gel electrophoresis, RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), whereas gluten immunogenicity was assayed by an anti-gliadin 33-mer monoclonal antibody (moAb). Plasmid combinations 1 and 2 downregulated only γ- and α-gliadins, respectively. Four plasmid combinations were highly effective in the silencing of ω-gliadins and γ-gliadins, and three of these also silenced α-gliadins. HMW glutenins were upregulated in all but one plasmid combination, while LMW glutenins were downregulated in three plasmid combinations. Total protein and starch contents were unaffected regardless of the plasmid combination used. Six plasmid combinations provided strong reduction in the gluten content as measured by moAb and for two combinations, this reduction was higher than 90% in comparison with the wild type. CD epitope analysis in peptides identified in LC-MS/MS showed that lines from three plasmid combinations were totally devoid of CD epitopes from the highly immunogenic α- and ω-gliadins.

These translocation lines were characterized by in situ hybridization and using molecular markers. In addition, reverse phase chromatography (HPLC) analysis was carried out to evaluate the carotenoid content and both 7Hchα∙7AL and 7AS∙7Hchβ disomic translocation lines. The carotenoid content in 7Hchα∙7AL and 7AS∙7Hchβ disomic translocation lines was higher than the wheat-7Hch addition line and double amount of carotenoids than the wheat itself. A proteomic analysis confirmed that the presence of chromosome 7Hch introgressions in wheat scarcely altered the proteomic profile of the wheat flour. The Psy1 (Phytoene Synthase1) gene, which is the first committed step in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, was also cytogenetically mapped on the 7Hchα chromosome arm.

Resolution was set at 50 000 full width at half maximum (FWHM) to achieve the right compromise between an adequate scan speed and selectivity, allowing for the limitations related to the necessary generic sample preparation approach. An exact mass with tolerance of 5 ppm and minimum peak threshold of 10 000 units were fixed as the main identification conditions, including retention time and isotopic pattern as additional criteria devoted to greatly reducing the risk of false-positive findings. The full validation for all the target analytes was performed: linearity, intermediate repeatability and recovery (28 analytes within 70-120%) were positively assessed; furthermore, limits of quantification between 5 and 100 µg kg(-1) (with most of the analytes having a limit of detection below 6 µg kg(-1)) indicate good performance, which is compatible with almost all the regulatory needs. Naturally contaminated and fortified mini-cakes, prepared through combined use of industrial and pilot plant production lines, were analysed at two different concentration levels, obtaining good overall quantitative results and providing preliminary indications of the potential of full-scan HRMS cluster analysis.

Among differentially expressed proteins, 22 were upregulated, while 21 proteins were downregulated in RS111 compared to CS.

Thirty-nine out of all the extracted volatiles were fully identified, whereas for 95 other volatiles a tentative identification was proposed, to give a complete as possible profile of wheat bread volatile compounds. The use of an array of ten structurally and physicochemically similar internal standards allowed to markedly improve method precision with respect to previous HS-SPME/GC-MS methods for bread volatiles. Good linearity of the method was verified for a selection of volatiles from several chemical groups by calibration with matrix-matched extraction solutions. This simple, rapid, precise and sensitive method could represent a valuable tool to obtain semi-quantitative information when investigating the influence of technological factors on volatiles formation in wheat bread and other bakery products.

The screen was applied to flour samples from 150 bread wheats grown at a single site in 2005, providing the largest sample set to date. Additionally, screening of 26 selected cultivars grown for two further years in the same location and in three additional European locations in the third year (2007) provided six widely different environments to allow estimation of the environmental (E) and G x E effects on asparagine levels. Asparagine concentrations in the 150 genotypes ranged from 0.32 to 1.56 mg/g dry matter in wholemeal wheat flours. Asparagine levels were correlated with plant height and therefore, due to recent breeding activities to produce semi-dwarf varieties, a negative relationship with the year of registration of the cultivar was also observed. The multisite study indicated that only 13% of the observed variation in asparagine levels was heritable, whilst the environmental contribution was 36% and the GxE component was 43%.

Artificial saliva, gastric juice and intestinal juice were successively pumped into a mini-column, packed with bread (maintained at 37 °C) connected on-line to the nebulizer of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrument equipped with a collision-reaction interface (CRI) using hydrogen as reaction gas to minimize carbon- and chlorine-based polyatomic interferences. In contrast to the conventional batch method to which it was compared, this approach provides real-time monitoring of potentially toxic elements that are continuously released during leaching. Mass balance for both methods was verified at the 95% confidence level. Results obtained from the whole wheat brown and white bread showed that the majority of Cr, Cd and Pb was leached by gastric juice but, in contrast, the majority of As was leached by saliva. While there was higher total content for elements in whole wheat bread than in white bread, a higher percentage of elements were bio-accessible in white bread than in whole wheat bread. Both the on-line and batch methods indicate that 40-98% of toxic elements in bread samples are bio-accessible.

CD-patients have to maintain a gluten-free diet and are therefore dependent on reliable testing and labeling of gluten-free products. So far, the R5-ELISA is the approved method to detect if food products can be labeled gluten-free. Because the R5-ELISA detects gluten in general, there is a demand for an improved detection method that quantifies specifically CD-epitopes. Therefore, we developed a new method for detection and quantification of CD-epitopes, based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. This method enables targeted label free comparative analysis of the gluten proteins present in different wheat varieties and species, and in wheat-based food products.

The performance of these procedures was evaluated for precision, accuracy, and LOD of the elements. It was established that the application of aqua regia allows determining elements with LOD within 0.1-42 ng/mL, precision of 0.2-4.1%, and accuracy better than 5%. Furthermore, good agreement between measured and certified values of a National Institute of Standards and Technology certified reference material of wheat flour (SRM 1567a) was found.

An in vitro multistep enzymatic digestion system simulating gastric, duodenal and colon phases was used to understand the fate of acrylamide in bakery and fried potato products. Acrylamide levels gradually decreased through gastric, duodenal and colon phases during in vitro digestion of biscuits. At the end of digestion, acrylamide reduction was between 49.2% and 73.4% in biscuits. Binary model systems composed of acrylamide and amino acids were used to understand the mechanism of acrylamide reduction. High-resolution mass spectrometry analyses confirmed Michael addition of amino acids to acrylamide during digestion. In contrast to bakery products, acrylamide levels increased significantly during gastric digestion of fried potatoes. The Schiff base formed between reducing sugars and asparagine disappeared rapidly, whereas the acrylamide level increased during the gastric phase. This suggests that intermediates like the Schiff base that accumulate in potatoes during frying are potential precursors of acrylamide under gastric conditions.

The functionally important gluten proteins of wheat are transported by two distinct routes to the protein bodies where they are stored: vesicles that bud directly off the ER and transport through the Golgi. However, little is known about the processing of glutenin and gliadin proteins during these steps or the possible impact on their properties. In plants, the RabD GTPases mediate ER-to-Golgi vesicle transport. Available sequence information for Rab GTPases in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium and bread wheat was compiled and compared to identify wheat RabD orthologs. Partial genetic sequences were assembled using the first draft of the Chinese Spring wheat genome. A suitable candidate gene from the RabD clade (TaRabD2a) was chosen for down-regulation by RNA interference (RNAi), and an RNAi construct was used to transform wheat plants. All four available RabD genes were shown by qRT-PCR to be down-regulated in the transgenic developing endosperm.

Cysteine residues of gliadins mainly form intramolecular disulfide bonds, although α-gliadins with odd numbers of cysteine residues have also been reported. Gliadins are generally regarded to possess globular protein structure, though recent studies report that the α/β-gliadins have compact globular structures and γ- and ω-gliadins have extended rod-like structures.

24844464,"Breadsticks are pencil-sized sticks of dry bread widely consumed as a pre-meal appetiser. They are basically wheat-based snacks, which makes them a good matrix to evaluate mycotoxin contamination, since wheat is very susceptible to fungal attack. In this sense, the fast, selective and sensitive gas chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (GC-QqQ-MS/MS) method proposed here allows simultaneous determination of deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, fusarenon-X, diacetoxyscirpenol, nivalenol, neosolaniol, HT-2 and T-2 toxin in breadsticks after QuEChERS extraction and clean-up. The performance of the method was assessed with respect to European Commission Regulations by studying the selectivity and specificity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), linearity, matrix effect, accuracy, precision and trueness. Satisfactory results in terms of validation parameters were obtained for all selected mycotoxins (recovery range of 70-110%, RSD < 10%, LOQ <40 µg kg(-1)). The trueness of the method was supported by using certified reference material (DON 1062 ± 110 µg kg(-1)). The method was successfully used to evaluate the occurrence of the studied Fusarium toxins in 61 breadstick samples. A total of 64% of the samples showed mycotoxin contamination, DON being the most frequently detected toxin. Nonetheless, mean levels obtained were far below the maximum levels permitted by European Union legislation. An additional goal was to carry out a risk-characterisation approach to DON by comparing probable daily intake and provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI).

24812068,"The bioavailability of whole-grain rye-derived phytochemicals has not yet been comprehensively characterized, and different baking and manufacturing processes can modulate the phytochemical composition of breads and other rye products. The aim of our study was to find key differences in the phytochemical profile of plasma after the consumption of 3 breads containing rye bran when compared with a plain white wheat bread control. Plasma metabolite profiles of 12 healthy middle-aged men and women were analyzed using LC quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis while fasting and at 60 min, 120 min, 240 min, and 24 h after consuming a meal that contained either 100% whole-grain sourdough rye bread or white wheat bread enriched with native unprocessed rye bran or bioprocessed rye bran. White wheat bread was used as the control. The meals were served in random order after a 12-h overnight fast, with at least 3 d between each occasion. Two sulfonated phenylacetamides, hydroxy-N-(2-hydroxyphenyl) acetamide and N-(2-hydroxyphenyl) acetamide, potentially derived from the benzoxazinoid metabolites, were among the most discriminant postprandial plasma biomarkers distinguishing intake of breads containing whole-meal rye or rye bran from the control white wheat bread. Furthermore, subsequent metabolite profiling analysis of the consumed breads indicated that different bioprocessing/baking techniques involving exposure to microbial metabolism (e.g., sourdough fermentation) have a central role in modulating the phytochemical content of the whole-grain and bran-rich breads.

However, the formation of some Maillard reaction-derived chemical hazards, such as acrylamide (AA) and N(ε) -(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) in cookies is also a significant consequence of baking processing from a food safety standpoint. This study investigated the effects of baking conditions on the formation of AA and CML, as well as the antioxidant activity (AOA) of cookies. Cookies were baked at various baking temperatures (155 to 230 °C) and times (1.5 to 31 min). AA and CML contents were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The highest level of AA was obtained in the cookies baked at 155 °C/21 min and 205 °C/11 min (328.93 ± 3.10 μg/kg and 329.29 ± 5.29 μg/kg), while the highest level of CML was obtained in the cookies baked at 230 °C/1.5 min (118.05 ± 0.21 mg/kg). AA was prone to form at relatively low temperature range (155 to 205 °C), however, CML at relatively high temperature range (205 to 230 °C). The CML content was much higher than the AA content in the same set of cookies, by about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. The AOA of cookies increased at more severe baking conditions. According to the AA and CML content, AOA and sensory properties of cookies, the temperature-time regime of 180 °C/16 min might be a compromised selection.

Postprandial metabolic responses were compared after the intake of refined wheat (RWB), whole-meal rye (WRB), and refined rye (RRB) breads. In addition, associations between the metabolic profile in fasting serum and the postprandial concentration of insulin in response to different breads were investigated. Nineteen postmenopausal women with normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance participated in a randomized, controlled, crossover meal study. The test breads, RWB (control), RRB, and WRB, providing 50 g of available carbohydrate, were each served as a single meal. The postprandial metabolic profile was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance and targeted LC-mass spectrometry and was compared between different breads using ANOVA and multivariate models. Eight amino acids had a significant treatment effect (P < 0.01) and a significant treatment × time effect (P < 0.05). RWB produced higher postprandial concentrations of leucine (geometric mean: 224; 95% CI: 196, 257) and isoleucine (mean ± SD: 111 ± 31.5) compared with RRB (geometric mean: 165; 95% CI: 147, 186; mean ± SD: 84.2 ± 22.9) and WRB (geometric mean: 190; 95% CI: 174, 207; mean ± SD: 95.8 ± 17.3) at 60 min respectively (P < 0.001). In addition, 2 metabolic subgroups were identified using multivariate models based on the association between fasting metabolic profile and the postprandial concentration of insulin. Women with higher fasting concentrations of leucine and isoleucine and lower fasting concentrations of sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines had higher insulin responses despite similar glucose concentration after all kinds of bread (cross-validated ANOVA, P = 0.048). High blood concentration of branched-chain amino acids, i.e., leucine and isoleucine, has been associated with the increased risk of diabetes, which suggests that additional consideration should be given to bread proteins in understanding the beneficial health effects of different kinds of breads. The present study suggests that the fasting metabolic profile can be used to characterize the postprandial insulin demand in individuals with normal glucose metabolism that can be used for establishing strategies for the stratification of individuals in personalized nutrition.

24679076,"Here, we conducted the first large-scale leaf phosphoproteome analysis of two bread wheat cultivars by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Altogether, 1802 unambiguous phosphorylation sites representing 1175 phosphoproteins implicated in various molecular functions and cellular processes were identified by gene ontology enrichment analysis. Among the 1175 phosphoproteins, 141 contained 3-10 phosphorylation sites. The phosphorylation sites were located more frequently in the N- and C-terminal regions than in internal regions, and ∼70% were located outside the conserved regions. Conservation analysis showed that 90.5% of the phosphoproteins had phosphorylated orthologs in other plant species. Eighteen significantly enriched phosphorylation motifs, of which six were new wheat phosphorylation motifs, were identified. In particular, 52 phosphorylated transcription factors (TFs), 85 protein kinases (PKs), and 16 protein phosphatases (PPs) were classified and analyzed in depth. All the Tyr phosphorylation sites were in PKs such as mitogen-activated PKs (MAPKs) and SHAGGY-like kinases.

24274280,"Acrylamide in food has drawn worldwide attention since 2002 due to its neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects. These influences brought out the dual polar and non-polar characters of acrylamide as they enabled it to dissolve in aqueous blood medium or penetrate the non-polar plasma membrane. In the current work, a simple HPLC/UV system was used to reveal that the penetration of acrylamide in non-polar phase was stronger than its dissolution in polar phase. The presence of phosphate salts in the polar phase reduced the acrylamide interaction with the non-polar phase. Furthermore, an eco-friendly and costless coupling of the HPLC/UV with ionic liquid based ultrasonic assisted extraction (ILUAE) was developed to determine the acrylamide content in food samples. ILUAE was proposed for the efficient extraction of acrylamide from bread and potato chips samples. The extracts were obtained by soaking of potato chips and bread samples in 1.5 mol L(-1) 1-butyl-3-methylimmidazolium bromide (BMIMBr) for 30.0 and 60.0 min, respectively and subsequent chromatographic separation within 12.0 min using Luna C18 column and 100% water mobile phase with 0.5 mL min(-1) under 25 °C column temperature at 250 nm. The extraction and analysis of acrylamide could be achieved within 2h. The mean extraction efficiency of acrylamide showed adequate repeatability with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 4.5%. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation were 25.0 and 80.0 ng mL(-1), respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was tested by recovery in seven food samples giving values ranged between 90.6% and 109.8%. Therefore, the methodology was successfully validated by official guidelines, indicating its reliability to be applied to analysis of real samples, proven to be useful for its intended purpose. Moreover, it served as a simple, eco-friendly and costless alternative method over hitherto reported ones.",Talanta,"['D020106', 'D001939', 'D002853', 'D005506', 'D052578', 'D011198', 'D052616', 'D014465']","['Acrylamide', 'Bread', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Ionic Liquids', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Ultrasonics']",Eco-friendly ionic liquid based ultrasonic assisted selective extraction coupled with a simple liquid chromatography for the reliable determination of acrylamide in food samples.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24274280,2014

The alkylresorcinol metabolites 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5-DHBA) and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (3,5-DHPPA) have been proposed as exposure biomarkers of whole-grain (WG) wheat and rye intake. However, the profile of alkylresorcinol metabolites is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolism of alkylresorcinols in mice and in humans, while further determining urinary pharmacokinetics of the novel alkylresorcinol metabolites to explore their potential as biomarkers of WG wheat intake. Utilization of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach resulted in 10 alkylresorcinol metabolites identified in mice and in humans, including 3 phenolic acids and 7 of their phase II conjugates. Among them, 2 novel metabolites were discovered: 5-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (3,5-DHPPTA) and 2-(3,5-dihydroxybenzamido)acetic acid (3,5-DHBA glycine). The structures of these 2 metabolites were confirmed by comparing with authentic standards synthesized in-house. In the pharmacokinetic study, a group of 12 volunteers consumed a polyphenolic-restricted diet for 4 d before ingesting WG wheat bread containing 61 mg of alkylresorcinols. Urine samples were collected for 32 h, and alkylresorcinol metabolites were quantified with HPLC-coulometric electrode array detection. The mean urinary excretion rates and mean apparent half-life of 3,5-DHPPTA, 3,5-DHBA glycine, 3,5-DHBA, and 3,5-DHPPA at each time point were determined. Our results suggest that 3,5-DHPPTA and 3,5-DHBA glycine may be used in combination with 3,5-DHBA and 3,5-DHPPA as potential biomarkers to increase the accuracy of recording WG wheat and rye intake in epidemiologic studies. Further validation of 3,5-DHPPTA and 3,5-DHBA glycine as potential biomarkers is warranted.

The research describes RtXyl purification from sorghum-induced submerged liquid cultures of this moderately thermophilic, aerobic, ascomycete fungus. The purified enzyme is a single subunit protein with a molecular mass of 42 kDa and exhibits glycosyl hydrolase family-10-like activity over a broad pH and temperature range. Optimal activity was measured at pH 6.0 and 65 °C respectively, which is suitable for bread making applications. Substrate specificity studies revealed that RtXyl is purely xylanolytic with no side-activities against other plant polysaccharides. The RtXyl catalytic efficiency (K cat/K m) was highest with oats spelt xylan (810.90 mg mL(-1) s(-1)), wheat arabinoxylan (809.52 mg mL(-1) s(-1)) and beechwood xylan (417.40 mg mL(-1) s(-1)) with less efficiency towards insoluble oats spelt xylan (236.40 mg mL(-1) s(-1)). Hydrolysis products analysed by thin layer chromatography yielded a range of xylosaccharides, predominantly xylotriose and xylobiose. RtXyl application in a basic wheat bread recipe at low dosages (0.297 XU/g) showed its suitability to increase loaf volume by 8.0 % compared with the control bread.

The method was optimised and validated to achieve low LODs. Ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IC-ICPMS) was used for arsenic speciation. The main quality parameters were established. To expand the applicability of the method, different cereal products were analysed: bread, biscuits, breakfast cereals, wheat flour, corn snacks, pasta and infant cereals. The total and inorganic arsenic content of 29 cereal-based food samples ranged between 3.7-35.6 and 3.1-26.0 μg As kg(-1), respectively.

24054621,"Being common in chromatographic techniques internal standard method is rarely applied in electrochemical stripping determinations. One of the reasons for such rare use of this elegant quantification method is because optimal conditions of accumulation at the electrode for individual compounds producing a reproducible signal may vary significantly. These criteria are much stricter when selenium is in question due to very complex mechanism of its accumulation at mercury electrodes which implies simultaneous cathodic mercury dissolution and chemical reaction. Elements that are in the analytical step stripped cathodically from mercury electrodes are rare, further limiting the application of the internal standard method when electrochemical selenium determination is in question. In this work the possibility of using sulphide for selenium quantification by chronopotentiometric stripping analysis was investigated. Optimal experimental parameters were defined in two-component systems. Dimensionless factors defining the ratio of proportionality constants of the two elements were calculated for different selenium concentration ranges at different sulphide contents. Sulphide content that was chosen as adequate for selenium concentrations reasonably to be expected in food samples was 500 µg/dm(3). Determined detection limit of chronopotentiometric stripping determination of selenium by using a sulphide as an internal standard was 0.04 µg/dm(3) (RSD=7.6%; n=5).

24015675,"The hexaploid genome of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is large (17 Gb) and repetitive, and this has delayed full sequencing and annotation of the genome, which is a prerequisite for effective quantitative proteomics analysis. Aware of these constraints we investigated the most effective approaches for shotgun proteomic analyses of bread wheat that would support large-scale quantitative comparisons using iTRAQ reagents. We used a data set that was generated by two-dimensional LC-MS of iTRAQ labeled peptides from wheat leaves. The main items considered in this study were the choice of sequence database for matching LC-MS data, the consistency of identification when multiple LC-MS runs were acquired, and the options for downstream functional analysis to generate useful insight. For peptide identification we examined the extensive NCBInr plant database, a smaller composite cereals database, the Brachypodium distachyon model plant genome, the EST-based SuperWheat database, as well as the genome sequence from the recently sequenced D-genome progenitor Aegilops tauschii. While the most spectra were assigned by using the SuperWheat database, this extremely large database could not be readily manipulated for the robust protein grouping that is required for large-scale, multirun quantitative experiments. We demonstrated a pragmatic alternative of using the composite cereals database for peptide spectra matching. The stochastic aspect of protein grouping across LC-MS runs was investigated using the smaller composite cereals database where we found that attaching the Brachypodium best BLAST hit reduced this problem. Further, assigning quantitation to the best Brachypodium locus yielded promising results enabling integration with existing downstream data mining and functional analysis tools. Our study demonstrated viable approaches for quantitative proteomics analysis of bread wheat samples and shows how these approaches could be similarly adopted for analysis of other organisms with unsequenced or incompletely sequenced genomes.

23895732,"The effect of salinity on mitochondrial properties was investigated by comparing the reference wheat variety Chinese Spring (CS) to a salt-tolerant amphiploid (AMP). The octoploid AMP genotype was previously generated by combining hexaploid bread wheat (CS) with the diploid wild wheatgrass adapted to salt marshes, Lophopyrum elongatum. Here we used a combination of physiological, biochemical, and proteomic analyses to explore the mitochondrial and respiratory response to salinity in these two genotypes. The AMP showed greater growth tolerance to salinity treatments and altered respiration rate in both roots and shoots. A proteomic workflow of 2D-DIGE and MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry was used to compare the protein composition of isolated mitochondrial samples from roots and shoots of both genotypes, following control or salt treatment. A large set of mitochondrial proteins were identified as responsive to salinity in both genotypes, notably enzymes involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species.

23881399,"Wheat grain storage protein (GSP) content and composition are the main determinants of the end-use value of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain. The accumulation of glutenins and gliadins, the two main classes of GSP in wheat, is believed to be mainly controlled at the transcriptional level through a network of transcription factors. This regulation network could lead to stable cross-environment allometric scaling relationships between the quantity of GSP classes/subunits and the total quantity of nitrogen per grain. This work conducted a genetic mapping study of GSP content and composition and allometric scaling parameters of grain N allocation using a bread wheat worldwide core collection grown in three environments. The core collection was genotyped with 873 markers for genome-wide association and 167 single nucleotide polymorphism markers in 51 candidate genes for candidate association. The candidate genes included 35 transcription factors (TFs) expressed in grain. This work identified 74 loci associated with 38 variables, of which 19 were candidate genes or were tightly linked with candidate genes. Besides structural GSP genes, several loci putatively trans-regulating GSP accumulation were identified. Seven candidate TFs, including four wheat orthologues of barley TFs that control hordein gene expression, were associated or in strong linkage disequilibrium with markers associated with the composition or quantity of glutenin or gliadin, or allometric grain N allocation parameters, confirming the importance of the transcriptional control of GSP accumulation. Genome-wide association results suggest that the genes regulating glutenin and gliadin compositions are mostly distinct from each other and operate differently.

We report herein a proteomic study on the bread wheat mutant strain 5660M underlying spike development inhibition. A total of 121 differentially expressed proteins, which were involved in cold stress response, protein folding and assembly, cell-cycle regulation, scavenging of ROS, and the autonomous pathway were identified using MS/MS and database searching. We found that cold responsive proteins were highly expressed in the mutant in contrast to those expressed in the wild-type line. Particularly, the autonomous pathway protein FVE, which modulates flowering, was dramatically downregulated and closely related to the spike development inhibition phenotype of 5660M. A quantitative RT-PCR study demonstrated that the transcription of the FVE and other six genes in the autonomous pathway and downstream flowering regulators were all markedly downregulated. The results indicate that spike development of 5660M cannot complete the floral transition. FVE might play an important role in the spikes development of the wheat.

With the exception of beverages and oil samples, a simple extraction with acetonitrile:water 80:20 (0.1% formic acid) was applied. Fruit juice, wine and beer samples were simply diluted with water containing 0.1% formic acid. Oil samples were partitioned with acetonitrile/hexane in order to remove fats. Analyses were made by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry with triple quadrupole. Validation was carried out in all selected matrices using blank samples spiked at two analyte concentrations. Extraction recoveries between 70 and 120% and relative standard deviations lower than 20% were obtained for the wide majority of analyte-matrix combinations. Matrix-matched calibration was used for a correct quantification in order to compensate for matrix effects. Limits of quantification were lower than maximum permitted levels for every regulated mycotoxin-matrix combination. The acquisition of three SRM transitions per compound allowed the unequivocal confirmation of positive samples, supported by the accomplishment of ion intensity ratios and retention time when compared with reference standards.

23614011,"Interspecific hybrids are commonplace in agriculture and horticulture; bread wheat and grapefruit are but two examples. The benefits derived from interspecific hybridisation include the potential of generating advantageous transgressive phenotypes. This paper describes the generation of a new breed of wine yeast by interspecific hybridisation between a commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast strain and Saccharomyces mikatae, a species hitherto not associated with industrial fermentation environs. While commercially available wine yeast strains provide consistent and reliable fermentations, wines produced using single inocula are thought to lack the sensory complexity and rounded palate structure obtained from spontaneous fermentations. In contrast, interspecific yeast hybrids have the potential to deliver increased complexity to wine sensory properties and alternative wine styles through the formation of novel, and wider ranging, yeast volatile fermentation metabolite profiles, whilst maintaining the robustness of the wine yeast parent. Screening of newly generated hybrids from a cross between a S. cerevisiae wine yeast and S. mikatae (closely-related but ecologically distant members of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto clade), has identified progeny with robust fermentation properties and winemaking potential. Chemical analysis showed that, relative to the S. cerevisiae wine yeast parent, hybrids produced wines with different concentrations of volatile metabolites that are known to contribute to wine flavour and aroma, including flavour compounds associated with non-Saccharomyces species. The new S. cerevisiae x S. mikatae hybrids have the potential to produce complex wines akin to products of spontaneous fermentation while giving winemakers the safeguard of an inoculated ferment.",PloS one,"['D001628', 'D002851', 'D015825', 'D003433', 'D004275', 'D005285', 'D005434', 'D005453', 'D006824', 'D010641', 'D016133', 'D012150', 'D059808', 'D012440', 'D012441', 'D012997', 'D013045', 'D027843', 'D014835', 'D014920']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromosomes, Fungal', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA, Ribosomal', 'Fermentation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polyphenols', 'Saccharomyces', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Solvents', 'Species Specificity', 'Vitis', 'Volatilization', 'Wine']",Introducing a new breed of wine yeast: interspecific hybridisation between a commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast and Saccharomyces mikatae.,"[None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000382']","[None, None, 'genetics', None, 'genetics', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, 'physiology', None, 'microbiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23614011,2013

23596967,"A multicompartmental nontargeted LC-MS metabolomics approach was used to study the metabolic responses on plasma and urine of hypercholesterolemic pigs after consumption of diets with contrasting dietary fiber composition (whole grain rye with added rye bran versus refined wheat). To study the metabolic responses, we performed a supervised multivariate data analyses used for pattern recognition, which revealed marked effects of the diets on both plasma and urine metabolic profiles. Diverse pools of metabolites were responsible for the discrimination between the diets. Elevated levels of phenolic compounds and dicarboxylic acids were detected in urine of pigs after rye consumption compared to refined wheat. Furthermore, consumption of rye was characterized by lower levels of linoleic acid derived oxylipins and cholesterol in the plasma metabolic profiles. These results indicate that higher consumption of nonrefined dietary fiber is reflected in higher excretion of phenolic compounds and dicarboxylic acids in urine and lower levels of linoleic acid derived oxylipins and cholesterol in plasma, which can be linked to beneficial health effects of rye components. On the other hand, pro-inflammatory lipid mediators were detected in higher concentration after rye consumption compared to refined wheat, which is opposite to what would be expected. These may indicate that even though a positive lowering effect with respect to cholesterol and fatty acids was achieved, this effect of rye dietary fiber was not sufficient to prevent inflammation in pigs. Moreover, we performed an alignment of the metabolic profiles between the breads consumed by pigs, plasma, and urine with the purpose to follow the metabolic fate of the compounds and to identify their pathways. One metabolite was identified in all three compartments, 16 metabolites were similar between bread and plasma, 3 were similar between plasma and urine, and 2 were similar between bread and urine.

Secoisolariciresinol, lariciresinol, pinoresinol, 7-hydroxymatairesinol, syringaresinol, isolariciresinol, secoisolariciresinol diglycoside, lariciresinol monoglycoside, pinoresinol mono-, di- and triglycoside, sesaminol, sesaminol triglycoside, sesamolinol and sesamolinol diglycoside were identified. Moderate heating at 100°C did not degrade the lignan aglycones and glycosides in dry foods. In contrast, heating was responsible for the better extractability of the lignans. If samples with high moisture content were heated, the degradation of the lignans in sesame seeds and rye was observed already at 100°C. Higher roasting temperatures caused degradation of aglycones and glycosides. Especially at 250°C, lignans were degraded rapidly in sesame seeds and rye but not in flax seeds.",Food chemistry,"['D003296', 'D019597', 'D006358', 'D017705', 'D013058', 'D012434', 'D012639', 'D031685']","['Cooking', 'Flax', 'Hot Temperature', 'Lignans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Secale', 'Seeds', 'Sesamum']","Effect of thermal heating on some lignans in flax seeds, sesame seeds and rye.","['Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['methods', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23411317,2013

High and moderate consumption of bread and crackers, potatoes, meat and meat products, milk and dairy products, and pizza and hamburger resulted in significantly lower odds ratios for blood lead levels than their low consumption. However, consumption of salted fish, white fish, green vegetables, white and yellow vegetables, coffee, and alcohol resulted in significantly higher odds ratios of blood lead and cadmium.

23330715,"Starch has unique physicochemical characteristics among food carbohydrates. Starch contributes to the physicochemical attributes of food products made from roots, legumes, cereals, and fruits. It occurs naturally as distinct particles, called granules. Most starch granules are a mixture of 2 sugar polymers: a highly branched polysaccharide named amylopectin and a basically linear polysaccharide named amylose. The starch contained in food products undergoes changes during processing, which causes changes in the starch molecular weight and amylose to amylopectin ratio. The objective of this study was to develop a new, simple, 1-step, and accurate method for simultaneous determination of amylose and amylopectin ratio as well as weight-averaged molecular weights of starch in food products. Starch from bread flour, canned peas, corn flake cereal, snack crackers, canned kidney beans, pasta, potato chips, and white bread was extracted by dissolving in KOH, urea, and precipitation with ethanol. Starch samples were solubilized and analyzed on a high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) system. To verify the identity of the peaks, fractions were collected and soluble starch and beta-glucan assays were performed additional to gas chromatography analysis. We found that all the fractions contain only glucose and soluble starch assay is correlated to the HPSEC fractionation.

Nowadays, analytical strategies for the detection of DON are well developed, but there are gaps for what concerns a correct identification, quantification and toxicological evaluation of the respective metabolites, mainly related to detoxifying actions via plant metabolism or to processing technologies and also referred to as ""masked"" mycotoxins. Here, we report the development of a liquid chromatography/linear ion trap mass spectrometry method capable of determining deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (DON-3G), which is the main known DON metabolite, in different processed cereal-derived products. Samples were extracted with a mixture of methanol/water (80:20; v/v) and cleaned up using immunoaffinity columns. Chromatographic separation was performed using a core-shell C(18) column with an aqueous acetic acid/methanol mixture as the mobile phase under gradient conditions. The method was in-house validated on a bread matrix as follows: matrix-matched linearity (r(2)>0.99) was established in the range of 10-200 μg kg(-1); trueness expressed as recovery was close to 90%; good intermediate precision (overall RSD<9%) and adequate detection quantitation limits (4 and 11 μg kg(-1), respectively) were achieved. Furthermore, applying a metrology approach based on intralaboratory data, the estimated measurement expanded uncertainty was determined to be equal to 29%.

In analytical conditions, the pH value of the run buffer was similar to that of the hydrolyzed samples, which helps in avoiding interactions of the analyte with silanol groups of the inner wall of the fused silica capillary. In all previous CE methods proposed in literature, no SPE treatment has been used. The method has been applied to the analysis of food products, such as flour, having low amounts of furosine. Flour samples of different origin (wheat, chestnut, lupin, einkorn, chickpeas) have been investigated. Different food products such as pasta, milk, and tigelle bread (a typical Italian unleavened bread) were also analyzed. Some of the samples have also been analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC, and when compared to CE-MS, data obtained showed good agreement. CE-MS, in comparison to HPLC, showed advantages in terms of time of analysis and cost. The validation procedure provided good values for LOD and LOQ (respectively 0.07 and 0.25 mg L(-1) ), recovery (77 and 97%), and precision investigated in terms of intraday repeatability (RSD%: 4-6% for peak areas; 1-2% for migration times) and intermediate precision (below 16% for peak areas, and below 7% for migration times).

32480776,"Various genetic-based approaches including mutant population screens, microarray analyses, cloning and transgenesis have broadened our knowledge of gene function during meiosis in plants. Nonetheless, these genetic tools are not without inherent limitations. One alternative approach to studying plant meiosis, especially in polyploids such as Triticum aestivum L. (bread wheat), is proteomics. However, protein-based approaches using proteomics have seldom been described, with only two attempts at studying early plant meiosis reported. Here, we report the investigation of early bread wheat meiosis using proteomics. Five differentially expressed protein spots were identified using 2D gel electrophoresis (2DGE) on protein extracts from four pooled stages of meiosis and three genotypes (Chinese Spring wild-type, ph1b and ph2a wheat mutant lines). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) identification of peptides from these protein spots led to the isolation and characterisation of the full-length clones of a wheat Speckle-type POZ protein, an SF21-like protein and HSP70, and a partial coding sequence of a hexose transporter. Significantly, the putative functions of the Speckle-type POZ protein and HSP70 were confirmed using in vitro DNA binding assays. Through the use of a 2DGE proteomics approach, we show that proteomics is a viable alternative to genetic-based approaches when studying meiosis in wheat. More significantly, we report a potential role for a Speckle-type POZ protein and a HSP70 in chromosome pairing during the early stages of meiosis in bread wheat.",Functional plant biology : FPB,[],[],Preliminary characterisation of two early meiotic wheat proteins after identification through 2D gel electrophoresis proteomics.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32480776,2020

Consumption data for the selected foodstuffs were collected by means of a food-frequency questionnaire. The studied population was grouped by age in infants, children, adolescents and adults; and exposure to OTA through the specified foodstuffs, and through wine and coffee, was assessed. Exposure assessment was done through deterministic and probabilistic modelling of the contamination and consumption data.

In this study, we examined how the in vivo starch digestibility is reflected by the glycemic response, because this response is often used to predict starch digestibility. Ten healthy male volunteers [age 21 ± 0.5 y, BMI 23 ± 0.6 kg/m² (mean ± SEM)] participated in a cross-over study, receiving three different meals: pasta with normal wheat bran (PA) and bread with normal (CB) or purple wheat bran (PBB). Purple wheat bran was added in an attempt to decrease the rate of starch digestion. The meals were enriched in ¹³C and the dual isotope technique was applied to calculate the rate of appearance of exogenous glucose (RaE). The ¹³C-isotopic enrichment of glucose in plasma was measured with GC/combustion/isotope ratio MS (IRMS) and liquid chromatography/IRMS. Both IRMS techniques gave similar results. Plasma glucose concentrations [2-h incremental AUC (iAUC)] did not differ between the test meals. The RaE was similar after consumption of CB and PBB, showing that purple wheat bran in bread does not affect in vivo starch digestibility. However, the iAUC of RaE after men consumed PA was less than after they consumed CB (P < 0.0001) despite the similar glucose response. To conclude, the glycemic response does not always reflect the in vivo starch digestibility.

Extraction and clean-up was performed using immunoaffinity columns and ZEA was detected and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorescence detection. A specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was administered to 1264 individuals by trained interviewers to estimate the consumption of the relevant foods. The results showed that the occurrence of ZEA in food marketed in Catalonia was infrequent. Sliced bread, corn snacks and sweet corn were the commodities where it was most often present. In considering the contamination levels and food consumption estimates, the dietary intake of ZEA by the Catalonian population was estimated to be considerably lower than the temporary tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 200 ng ZEA kg(-1) bw day(-1).",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"['D002846', 'D002851', 'D004781', 'D004967', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D009183', 'D013030', 'D013050', 'D015025']","['Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Estrogens', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Mycotoxins', 'Spain', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Zearalenone']","Occurrence of zearalenone, an oestrogenic mycotoxin, in Catalonia (Spain) and exposure assessment.","[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22155269,2012

White bread and with addition of 15, 30, or 45% of bran was baked in a bakery by traditional methods, with addition of yeasts and rye leaven, from flour made of wheat, Tonacja variety. Concentrations of calcium, magnesium, manganese, zinc, copper, and iron were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Bread was enzymatically digested in vitro without and with the addition of Bifidobacterium bifidum KD6 (inoculum 10(6) CFU/cm(3)) and percentages of minerals released were determined. The concentration of minerals released during enzymatic digestion varied depending upon the element, quantity of bran, and presence of bacteria. Increase in bran content decreased release of elements. Bifidobacterium bifidum KD6 enhanced amounts of magnesium and zinc released from all types of bread, while manganese and copper rose only from white bread with 15% bran addition.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between blood cadmium concentration (BCdC) and food consumption, nutrients intake (Ca, Fe, Zn, vitamin C, and vitamin D), tobacco smoking, and some other variables (age, body mass index, and residence) in 243 adults living in the Italian island of Sardinia (Sassari Province). Specifically, we hypothesized that offal consumption contributes to Cd intakes and blood levels. The BCdC was quantified by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, and information on personal data was collected through questionnaires. Smoke significantly contributed to the BCdC (P < .001). Nonsmoker subjects who eat offal showed significantly higher BCdC (P = .04). Moreover, slightly higher BCdCs were also observed in nonsmoker subjects who eat rice, fish, and bread. The BCdC positively correlated with age of subjects (r = 0.144; P = .025) and offal daily intake in nonsmokers (r = 0.393; P < .001). The intake of Ca was negatively correlated (r = -0.281; P = .001) with the BCdC in females.

21938472,"Bread is one of the major constituents of the human diet and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most important cereal for bread making. The gluten proteins (glutenins and gliadins) are recognised as important components affecting the processing quality of wheat flour. In this research, we investigated a particular glutenin subunit allele in an Australian cultivar, H45. Based on protein and DNA assays, the Glu-B1 allele of H45 seems to be Glu-B1al, an allele that includes a functional duplication of a gene encoding an x-type high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit, and is thought to increase dough strength through overexpression of that subunit. Yet H45 does not have the dough properties that would be expected if it carries the Glu-B1al allele. After confirming that H45 overexpresses Bx subunits and that it has relatively low un-extractable polymeric protein (an indicator of weak dough), we cloned and sequenced two Bx genes from H45. The sequences of the two genes differ from each other, and they each differ by four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the sequence that has been reported for the Glu-B1al x-type glutenin genes of the Canadian wheat cultivar Glenlea. One of the SNPs leads to an extra cysteine residue in one of the subunits. The presence of this additional cysteine may explain the dough properties of H45 through effects on cross-linkage within or between glutenin subunits. We propose that the Glu-B1 allele of H45 be designated Glu-B1br, and we present evidence that Glu-B1br is co-inherited with low un-extractable polymeric protein.",TAG.

The detection capabilities of this novel method were demonstrated by analyzing incurred material containing milk, egg, soy, peanut, hazelnut, walnut, and almond. Bread was chosen as a model matrix. To assess the influence of baking on the method's performance, analysis was done before and after baking. The same samples were analyzed with ELISA test kits from ELISA Systems, Morinaga, Neogen, and r-Biopharm. Peanut, hazelnut, walnut, and almond could be detected with both ELISA and LC/MS/MS regardless of whether the product was baked or not.

21844700,"Complex groups of proteins determine the unique functional properties of wheat flour and are sometimes responsible for food intolerances and allergies in individuals that consume wheat products. Transgenic approaches can be used to explore the functions of different flour proteins, but are limited to the few wheat cultivars that can be transformed and also by the lack of detailed information about genes and proteins expressed in grain from those cultivars. The US bread wheat Butte 86 has been extensively characterized and a comprehensive proteome map was developed in which flour proteins were distinguished by mass spectrometry and associated with specific gene sequences. Here, this information has been used to design an RNA interference construct to silence the expression of genes encoding omega gliadins that trigger the food allergy wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). The construct was introduced into immature embryos from Butte 86 using biolistics and bialaphos-resistant plants were regenerated. Stable transformation and inheritance of the transgene were confirmed by PCR. Analysis of proteins in grain from transgenic plants demonstrated that the omega-5 gliadins were either absent or substantially reduced relative to non-transformed controls. The ability to genetically transform Butte 86 makes it possible to alter flour composition in a targeted manner in a commercial US wheat cultivar and should accelerate future research on flour quality and immunogenic potential.",GM crops,"['D000485', 'D052179', 'D020868', 'D005903', 'D030821', 'D016133', 'D014170', 'D014908']","['Allergens', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gliadin', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Triticum']",Transformation of the US bread wheat 'Butte 86' and silencing of omega-5 gliadin genes.,"['Q000235', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235']","['genetics', None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'genetics', 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21844700,2012

Mycotoxin fragmentation patterns obtained by high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) were investigated to obtain quantitative and confirmatory information (two characteristic masses per mycotoxin) using Orbitrap™-based high-resolution mass spectrometry. LC-HRMS (full-scan) detection carried out by HCD allows the monitoring of the pseudo-molecular ion and an additional characteristic fragment (for each mycotoxin) with mass accuracy in the range 0.1-3.9 ppm, meeting current European regulatory requirements for LC-MS confirmatory analysis. A sample preparation procedure based on polymeric solid-phase extraction cartridges was applied, allowing recoveries higher than 74% for nine mycotoxins, with a relative standard deviation lower than 13%. Detection limits in the range 0.5-3.4 µg kg(-1) were obtained for three cereal matrices. A critical comparison between the proposed method and a validated method based on triple quadrupole mass spectrometry showed similar performance in terms of detection limits, recoveries and repeatability, and matrix effects. Based on an efficient sample extraction and clean-up, the LC-HCD-HRMS method reported here represents a reliable and robust alternative tool for mycotoxin analysis in food matrices as compared with well-established triple quadrupole-based approaches.","Food additives & contaminants.

The aim of this study was to profile the phenolic content of 16 old and 6 modern Italian wheat varieties, cropped in the same location and growing season. High variability was observed among the investigated wheat genotypes, both in the free and bound phenolic extracts. The total polyphenol content ranged from 885.5 to 1715.9 μmol GAE/100 g of grain and, on average, the bound fraction contributed for 72.0% to the total phenolic content. As regards the flavonoid content, the free fraction ranged from 50.7 to 106.1 μmol CE/100 g of grain and the bound fraction from 78.3 to 148.9 μmol CE/100 g of grain. Moreover, the interpretation of the mass spectra allowed the characterization of 34 phenolic compounds (104 including isomer forms) belonging to the phenolic acid, flavonoid, coumarin, stilbene, proanthocyanidin and lignan chemical classes. HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS analysis highlighted remarkable differences in the phytochemical fingerprints of old and modern wheat varieties. Six ancient wheat genotypes (Bianco Nostrale, Frassineto, Gentil Rosso, Gentil Rosso Mutico, Marzuolo d'Aqui, Verna) showed phenolic profiles with a number of total compounds and isomer forms much higher than that identified in the modern cultivars.

Several samples were collected during the pasta-making process (dough, extruded, dried, and cooked pasta) and tested for their riboflavin content by a high-performance liquid chromatography method. The applied approaches resulted in a considerable increase of vitamin B2 content (about 2- and 3-fold increases in pasta and bread, respectively), thus representing a convenient and efficient food-grade biotechnological application for the production of vitamin B2-enriched bread and pasta.

Optimised sample preparation prior to analysis involved addition of (13)C(5) labelled internal standards, treatments with α-amylase and rat serum, solid-phase extraction using aromatic-selective cartridges and ultra-filtration. Analytes were separated on a Waters ACQUITY HSS T3 column during a 6-min run and analysed by positive ion electrospray selected reaction monitoring MS/MS. Standard calibration curves for the two analytes were linear over the range of 0.018-14 μg FA/g of fresh bread (r(2) = 0.997) and 9.3-900 ng 5-MTHF/g of fresh bread (r(2) = 0.999). The absolute recoveries were 90% and 76% for FA and 5-MTHF, respectively. Intra-day coefficients of variation were 3% for FA and 18% for 5-MTHF.

Samples were extracted with a mixture of acetonitrile/water (84:16, v/v) and cleaned up through a polymeric solid-phase extraction column. Detection and quantification of the nine mycotoxins were performed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS), using fully (13)C-isotope-labelled mycotoxins as internal standards. The method was validated in-house for five different cereal processed products, namely barley, oat and durum wheat flours, rye- and wheat-based crisp bread. Recoveries and repeatability of the whole analytical procedure were evaluated at contamination levels encompassing the EU maximum permitted levels for each tested mycotoxin. Recoveries ranged from 89 to 108% for deoxynivalenol, from 73 to 114% for aflatoxins, from 85 to 114% for T-2 and HT-2 toxins, from 64 to 97% for zearalenone, from 74 to 102% for ochratoxin A.

Ancient cultivars of wheat are gaining interest today but nothing is known about their allergenicity. Many wheat proteins have been reported as causative food allergens, including some prolamin-type gluten proteins, and salt soluble proteins of the albumin/globulin (A/G) type. The objective of this work is to obtain information about the allergenicity of the salt soluble A/G fraction of an ancient diploid cultivar compared with a standard hexaploid bread wheat cultivar using 20 sera from patients with wheat allergy. Differences in the IgE reactivity of sera towards the two genotypes were quantified by ELISA. Qualitative differences in IgE-binding proteins were searched after 1D or 2D electrophoresis.

The reduction of mould growth in bakery products is thus of crucial importance and there is great interest to develop safe and efficient strategies for this purpose. In this study Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM19280 has been shown to produce a wide spectrum of antifungal compounds active against common bread spoilage fungi. Among the indicator moulds, Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium culmorum were the most sensitive organisms. Several antifungal compounds were found to be present in synthetic medium inoculated with L. amylovorus DSM19280 strain, some of them being reported here for the first time. Wheat doughs fermented with L. amylovorus DSM19280 had good rheological properties and the breads thereof were of high quality as shown by rheofermentometer and texture analyser measurements. The results were compared with those obtained with a control non-antifungal L. amylovorus DSM20531(T) strain, a non-acidified and a chemically acidified dough. The quality of sourdough and bread fermented with L. amylovorus DSM 19280 was comparable to that obtained by using L. amylovorus DSM20531 (T). Additionally, breads were evaluated for the ability to retard the growth of Fusarium culmorum FST 4.05, Aspergillus niger FST4.21, Penicillium expansum FST 4.22, Penicillium roqueforti FST 4.11 and fungal flora from the bakery environment. The biological preservation of bread with L. amylovorus DSM 19280 was also compared to the most commonly used antifungal agent Calcium propionate.

20975830,"The bread-making quality of wheat is strongly influenced by multiple low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) proteins expressed in the seeds. However, the organization, recombination and expression of LMW-GS genes and their functional mechanism in bread-making are not well understood. Here we report a systematic molecular analysis of LMW-GS genes located at the orthologous Glu-3 loci (Glu-A3, B3 and D3) of bread wheat using complementary approaches (genome wide characterization of gene members, expression profiling, proteomic analysis). Fourteen unique LMW-GS genes were identified for Xiaoyan 54 (with superior bread-making quality). Molecular mapping and recombination analyses revealed that the three Glu-3 loci of Xiaoyan 54 harbored dissimilar numbers of LMW-GS genes and covered different genetic distances. The number of expressed LMW-GS in the seeds was higher in Xiaoyan 54 than in Jing 411 (with relatively poor bread-making quality). This correlated with the finding of higher numbers of active LMW-GS genes at the A3 and D3 loci in Xiaoyan 54. Association analysis using recombinant inbred lines suggested that positive interactions, conferred by genetic combinations of the Glu-3 locus alleles with more numerous active LMW-GS genes, were generally important for the recombinant progenies to attain high Zeleny sedimentation value (ZSV), an important indicator of bread-making quality. A higher number of active LMW-GS genes tended to lead to a more elevated ZSV, although this tendency was influenced by genetic background. This work provides substantial new insights into the genomic organization and expression of LMW-GS genes, and molecular genetic evidence suggesting that these genes contribute quantitatively to bread-making quality in hexaploid wheat.

DON concentrations in flour, wheat and selected foods made from them under commercially relevant conditions were compared by GC with electron capture detection. Average concentrations (n = 9/item) in cookies, crackers and pretzels ranged from 61% (cookies) to 111% (pretzels) compared with flour (100% = 0.46 μg g⁻¹). Lesser amounts were found in donuts and bread: their respective DON concentrations were 44% and 30% that of flour. Mass balance estimates for DON (μg g⁻¹ flour equivalents) ranged from 50% (bread = 0.23 μg g⁻¹ flour equivalents) to 120% (donuts), indicating that dilution by recipe ingredients contributed to DON reductions in bread and accounted for all of the apparent reduction in donuts. Mass balance estimates averaged 76% (crackers) to 107% (pretzels) for the other flour products. DON concentrations were higher in cereal flakes (0.55 μg g⁻¹ in the finished product and 0.58 μmg g⁻¹ on a mass balance basis) than in wheat (0.40 μg g⁻¹), suggesting that DON concentrations might increase during processing of wheat cereals under some conditions. In summary, DON concentrations of finished food products were reduced ≥ 50% only in bread and donuts. Reduction in bread resulted from a combination of DON ‘loss’ and dilution by recipe ingredients whereas the reduction in donuts was due entirely to dilution.

The extraction is carried out with 75:25 (v/v) tetrahydrofuran:water, a solvent mixture that provides an appropriate balance of hydrogen bonding, dispersion and dipole-dipole interactions to efficiently extract PFCs with chains containing 4-14 carbon atoms from foods. This mixture provided recoveries above 85% from foods including vegetables, fruits, fish, meat and bread; and above 75% from cheese. Clean-up with a weak anion exchange resin and Envi-carb SPE, which were coupled in line for simplicity, was found to minimize matrix effects (viz. enhancement or suppression of electrospray ionization). The target analytes (PFCs) were resolved on a perfluorooctyl phase column that proved effective in separating mass interferences for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in fish and meat samples. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative electrospray ionization mode and used to record two transitions per analyte and one per mass-labeled method internal standard. The target PFCs were quantified from solvent based calibration curves. The limits of detection (LODs) were as low as 1-5 pg analyte g(-1) food; by exception, those for C(4) and C(5) PFCs were somewhat higher (25-30 pg g(-1)) owing to their less favourable mass response. To the best of our knowledge these are among the best LODs for PFCs in foods reported to date. The analysis of a variety of foods revealed contamination with PFCs at levels from 4.5 to 75 pg g(-1) in 25% of samples (fish and packaged spinach). C(10)-C(14) PFCs were found in fish, which testifies to the need to control long-chain PFCs in this type of food.

For this reason 7 brands of potato and 8 brands of corn products (10 each) were collected, crashed and after preparing the extracts of each sample, using LC-MS-MS spectrometry for measuring acrylamide amount. Results showed that in different brands of potato and corn products there were different amounts (244-1688 microg/kg) and (<30-410 microg/kg) of acrylamide, respectively.

In the near future, maximum levels for these trichothecenes will be regulated by the European Commission as announced in EU (VO) 1881/2006. For the implementation of these maximum levels, more data on occurrence and behaviour of T-2 and HT-2 toxins in primary agricultural products as well as during cleaning treatment and food processing are needed. In the current work, we determined the T-2/HT-2 concentrations in four oat cultivars (Aragon, Dominik, Ivory, Pergamon) from ten different agricultural sites in Germany, grown in cultivar studies in 2007. The grains were de-hulled, oat meal was prepared, and bread with 20% oat meal and 80% wheat flour was baked. In the cereal-processing chain, samples were taken at various steps and subsequently analysed for their T-2/HT-2 content. We employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and an immunological screening method (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA)) for T-2/HT-2 determination. Detection limits were between 1 and 10 microg kg(-1) in different matrices. T-2/HT-2 concentrations determined by ELISA in oat samples from ten different agricultural sites in Germany were between 9 and 623 microg kg(-1). The median and 90th percentile were 48 and 191 microg kg(-1) T-2/HT-2, respectively. One site showed six times higher T-2/HT-2 levels than the other sites, where concentrations ranged from 322 to 623 microg kg(-1). In 80% of the samples the cultivars Pergamon and Ivory had the lowest concentration of T-2 and HT-2 toxins. Using LC-MS for T-2/HT-2 determination, cleaning of the raw material did not lead to significant reductions of T-2 and HT-2 levels, whereas de-hulling led to a reduction of over 90%. Boiling of oat meal produced from cleaned raw material to yield 'porridge' resulted in varying T-2/HT-2 levels in experimental replicates. No major reduction of T-2/HT-2 levels in cooked porridge was obtained. Standardized baking experiments using 20% oat meal showed that T-2 and HT-2 toxins are relatively stable during the baking process, probably due to their temperature stability.","Food additives & contaminants.

20455161,"Fusarium mycotoxins are a relevant problem in the cereal supply chain at a worldwide level, with wheat, maize and barley being the main contaminated crops. Mould growth can happen in the pre-harvest phase and also during transport and storage due to ineffective drying conditions. Among Fusarium toxins, deoxynivalenol (DON) is considered the most important contaminant in wheat due to its widespread occurrence. In the last years the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Commission have frequently expressed opinions on Fusarium toxins, setting limits, regulations and guidelines in order to reduce their levels in raw materials and food commodities. In particular, European legislation (Reg. 1881/2006) sets the maximum limit for DON in flour and bread as 750 and 500 microg kg(-1) respectively. Relatively few studies have taken into account the loss of trichothecenes during processing, focusing on how processing factors may influence their degradation. In particular, the description of DON behaviour during bread-making is very difficult, since complex physico-chemical modifications occur during the transformation of the raw ingredients into the final product. In the present study, we studied how DON concentration may be influenced by modifying bread-making parameters, with a special emphasis on the fermentation and baking stages, starting from a naturally contaminated flour at both pilot and industrial scales. Exploiting the power of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach to consider the great complexity of the studied system, the obtained model shows satisfying goodness-of-fit and prediction, suggesting that the baking step (time/temperature ranges) is crucial for minimizing native DON level in bread.","Food additives & contaminants.

19747607,"Several lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genera Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Weissella have been introduced to wheat sourdough baking for in situ production of exopolysaccharides. This is considered a novel method for improving the shelf-life, volume and nutritional value of bread without additives. However, in situ production of exopolysaccharides during sourdough fermentation is challenged by simultaneous acidification due to metabolic activities of the bacteria, which may significantly diminish the positive technological impact of exopolysaccharides. In this study, the growth, activity and in situ production of dextran by Weissella confusa VTT E-90392 in wheat sourdoughs were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of dextran-enriched sourdoughs, at the addition level of 43%, on the subsequent bread quality was established. W. confusa efficiently produced dextran from the added sucrose in wheat sourdough without strong acid production. A new specific enzyme-assisted method for in situ analysis of dextran in sourdoughs was developed. With this method, we could for the first time proof significant (11-16 g/kg DW) production of polymeric dextran in sourdoughs. Concomitant formation of shorter isomaltooligosaccharides by W. confusa was also detected. The produced dextran significantly increased the viscosity of the sourdoughs. Application of dextran-enriched sourdoughs in bread baking provided mildly acidic wheat bread with improved volume (up to 10%) and crumb softness (25-40%) during 6 days of storage. Hence, W. confusa is a promising new strain for efficient in situ production of dextrans and isomaltooligosaccharides in sourdoughs without strong acidification.",Food microbiology,"['D001939', 'D002852', 'D015169', 'D003911', 'D005433', 'D005504', 'D005511', 'D006244', 'D006863', 'D056584', 'D011786', 'D013395', 'D014908', 'D014783']","['Bread', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Dextrans', 'Flour', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Hardness', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leuconostocaceae', 'Quality Control', 'Sucrose', 'Triticum', 'Viscosity']",In situ production and analysis of Weissella confusa dextran in wheat sourdough.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, None]","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19747607,2010

Jinan 177 (JN177) was investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Of a set of 93 (root) and 65 (leaf) differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 34 (root) and six (leaf) DEPs were cultivar-specific. The remaining DEPs were salinity/drought stress-responsive but not cultivar-specific. Many of the DEPs were expressed under both drought and salinity stresses. The amounts of stress-responsive DEPs between SR3 and JN177 were almost equivalent, whereas only some of these DEPs were shared by the two cultivars. Overall, the number of salinity-responsive DEPs was greater than the number of drought-responsive DEPs. And most of the drought-responsive DEPs also responded to salinity. There are both similarities and differences in the responses of wheat to salinity and drought. A parallel transcriptomics analysis showed that the correlation between transcriptional and translational patterns of DEPs was poor.

The aim of this work was to study the variation of the levels of OTA, deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) and nivalenol (NIV) during the bread-making process. This was done by using wheat flour spiked with different levels of toxins. Mycotoxin levels were controlled after fermentation of the dough with yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and after further baking at different temperature-time combinations. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the results showed a significant reduction in OTA level (p < 0.05) during fermentation of the dough. The reduction ranged between 29.8% and 33.5%, depending on the initial concentration of toxin in the flour. During this period, the level of the other mycotoxins studied was not modified. By contrast, in the baking phase there were significant changes in the levels of the four mycotoxins, although the reduction was similar under all the baking conditions. Considering all the temperature-time conditions tested, it can be concluded that during the baking period the average reduction of OTA, NIV, 3-ADON, and DON was 32.9%, 76.9%, 65.6%, and 47.9%, respectively.","Food additives & contaminants.

Triplicate runs of each product were manufactured by commercial food manufacturers between September 2006 and May 2007 with iodized and non-iodized salt. Triplicate samples were taken at various steps during processing of each food and analysed for moisture and iodine content. Iodine concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry following an alkaline digestion. Iodine, at the equivalent of 25-65 mg of iodine per kg salt, was 100% retained in each of the selected foods from the time of mixing to the final product. These results imply that all iodine added via salt at the time of manufacture is available for consumption but not necessarily bioavailable. These data can be used for modelling the impact of strategies to increase iodine exposure.

Biofortification of food crops is the best approach for alleviating the micronutrient deficiencies. Identification of germplasm with high grain Fe and Zn and understanding the genetic basis of their accumulation are the prerequisites for manipulation of these micronutrients. Some wild relatives of wheat were found to have higher grain Fe and Zn concentrations compared with the cultivated bread wheat germplasm. One accession of Triticum boeoticum (pau5088) that had relatively higher grain Fe and Zn was crossed with Triticum monococcum (pau14087), and a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population generated from this cross was grown at 2 locations over 2 years.

Oat (Avena sativa) seed extracts exhibited a high degree of antifungal activity and could be used directly on rye bread to prevent the formation of P. roqueforti colonies. Proteins in the oat seed extracts were fractionated by column chromatography and proteins in fractions containing antifungal activity were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and database searches. Identified antifungal candidates included thaumatin-like proteins, 1,3-beta-glucanase, permatin precursor, pathogenesis-related protein type 1, and chitinases of class I and II. Class I chitinase could be specifically removed from the extracts and was found to be indispensable for 50% of the P. roqueforti inhibiting activity. The purified class I chitinase has a molecular weight of approximately 34 kDa, optimal chitinase activity at pH 7, and exists as at least two basic isoforms (pI values of 7.6 and 8.0). Partial sequencing of the class I chitinase isoforms by LC-MS/MS revealed a primary structure with high similarity to class I chitinases of wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and rye (Secale cereale). Oat, wheat, barley, and rye seed extracts were compared with respect to the abundance of the class I chitinase and decrease in antifungal activity when class I chitinase is removed.

Proteomic analyses showed that, during seed development, several classes of endosperm proteins were differentially accumulated in the transformed endosperm. As a result of the strong increase in the amount of the transgenic protein, the endogenous glutenin subunit, all subclasses of gliadins, and metabolic as well as chloroform/methanol soluble proteins were diminished in the transgenic genotype. The differential accumulation detected by proteomic analyses, both in mature and developing seeds, was paralleled by the corresponding changes in transcript levels detected by microarray experiments. Our results suggest that the most evident effect of the strong overexpression of the transgenic glutenin gene consists in a global compensatory response involving a significant decrease in the amounts of polypeptides belonging to the prolamin superfamily.

The absence of urinary flavan-3-ol metabolites after ingestion of 200 mg of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate indicates that there is no removal of the 3-O-galloyl group in vivo, and hence, this does not account for the high urinary recovery of (epi)gallocatechin metabolites after ingestion of Polyphenon E. Increasing the intake of Polyphenon E, by feeding doses of 200, 500, and 1500 mg, led to increased urinary excretion of (epi)catechin metabolites but not metabolites of (epi)gallocatechin. Coingestion of 200 mg of Polyphenon E with bread, cheese, or glucose did not significantly modify the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of flavan-3-ols. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the same would occur when flavan-3-ols are ingested with more complex food matrices.",The Journal of nutrition,"['D000328', 'D001682', 'D002392', 'D004041', 'D004305', 'D005260', 'D005419', 'D005502', 'D018565', 'D006801', 'D007081', 'D008297', 'D015394', 'D013662']","['Adult', 'Biological Availability', 'Catechin', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flavonoids', 'Food', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Ileostomy', 'Male', 'Molecular Structure', 'Tea']",Bioavailability of polyphenon E flavan-3-ols in humans with an ileostomy.,"[None, None, 'Q000008', 'Q000493', None, None, 'Q000008', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'administration & dosage', 'pharmacokinetics', None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18641203,2008

To prepare an effective immunogen compound for acrylamide, N-acryloxysuccinimide (NAS) was conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) at a high molar ratio of 21.2:1. Antisera were obtained by immunization of rabbits with additional booster injections of the NAS-BSA conjugate after the regular process. The IgGs purified by an ammonium sulfate precipitation method were further fractionated with a BSA-immobilized immunoaffinity column. The affinity constant between the collected antibody and coated antigen (NAS-ovalbumin) is found to be 6.7 x 10(7) L mol(-1). Asparagine, the key precursor of acrylamide formation in foods, showed negligible cross-reactivity to the antibody.

Different parameters, such as the amount of immunoreagents, type of the materials, composition of the blocking solution and of the detector reagent mixture, were investigated to provide the optimum assay performance. The experimental results demonstrated that such a visual test had an indicator range rather than a cut-off value. Thus, tests for DON determination with two different indicator ranges of 250-500 and 1000-2000 microg kg(-1) were designed. The method allowed detection of DON at low and high concentration levels, which could be useful for research and practical purposes. The assay applied to spiked wheat and pig feed samples demonstrated accurate and reproducible results. The applicability of the developed lateral-flow test was also confirmed under real field conditions. The test strips prepared in Belgium were sent to Mexico, where they were used for the screening of DON contamination in different bread wheat entries from Fusarium Head Blight inoculated plots. The results were compared with those obtained by ELISA and LC-MS/MS. A poor correlation between ELISA and LC-MS/MS was observed. Visual results of the dipstick tests were in a good agreement with the results of the LC-MS/MS method. Coupled with a simple and fast sample preparation, this qualitative one-step test based on the visual evaluation of results did not require any equipment. Results could be obtained within 10 min.

Regardless of whether the grains were naturally infected or artificially inoculated by Fusarium spp. in the field, the fractions obtained from the grain-cleaning procedure contained the highest mycotoxin levels. During milling the highest concentrations of deoxynivalenol were found in the bran, the lowest in the reduction flours. Baking at 210 degrees C for 14 min had no significant effect on deoxynivalenol levels. The rheological properties of dough measured by fermentograph, maturograph, oven rise recorder, and laboratory baking test were carried out, and based on the obtained results the influence of mycotoxin content on rheological behaviour was investigated.","Food additives & contaminants.

Samples were extracted using acidic conditions and the extracts subjected to an automated solid-phase clean up using combined cation exchange/reversed-phase sorbent cartridges (Oasis-MCX). Subsequent chromatographic separation and analysis was performed by liquid chromatography (LC) with fluorescence detection (FLD) and by LC with mass spectrometric detection (MS/MS). The ergot alkaloid (EAs) content of a sample was defined as the sum of the 16 alkaloids ergometrin(in)e, ergosin(in)e, ergotamin(in)e, ergostin(in)e, ergocornin(in)e, α-ergocryptin(in)e, β-ergocryptin(in)e and ergocristin(in)e. Comparability of results obtained by LC-FLD and LC-MS/MS was satisfactory, but varied for different alkaloids. The use of dihydro-ergocristine as an internal standard considerably improved the reliability of analytical data from LC-MS/MS. Compared with earlier data (Baumannet al., 1985) for median levels of ergot alkaloids in rye flour (140 ng/g) and bread (21.3 ng/g) from Switzerland, the median values for ergot alkaloids in rye flour collected in 2001 (n=13) and in 2005 (n=2) were 172 ng/g and 160 ng/g, respectively.

18215649,"The spontaneous formation of the neurotoxic carcinogen acrylamide in a wide range of cooked foods has recently been discovered. These foods include bread and other bakery products, crisps, chips, breakfast cereals, and coffee. To date, the diminutive size of acrylamide (71.08 Da) has prevented the development of screening immunoassays for this chemical. In this study, a polyclonal antibody capable of binding the carcinogen was produced by the synthesis of an immunogen comprising acrylamide derivatised with 3-mercaptobenzoic acid (3-MBA), and its conjugation to the carrier protein bovine thyroglobulin. Antiserum from the immunised rabbit was harvested and fully characterised. It displayed no binding affinity for acrylamide or 3-MBA but had a high affinity for 3-MBA-derivitised acrylamide. The antisera produced was utilised in the development of an ELISA based detection system for acrylamide. Spiked water samples were assayed for acrylamide content using a previously published extraction method validated for coffee, crispbread, potato, milk chocolate and potato crisp matrices. Extracted acrylamide was then subjected to a rapid 1-h derivatisation with 3-MBA, pre-analysis. The ELISA was shown to have a high specificity for acrylamide, with a limit of detection in water samples of 65.7 microgkg(-1), i.e. potentially suitable for acrylamide detection in a wide range of food commodities.

The method, using liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS/MS), allowed unambiguous identification of the selected trichothecenes at low microg per kg levels in such complex food matrices. A clean-up procedure, based on reversed phase SPE Oasis HLB columns, was used, allowing good recoveries for all studied trichothecenes. In particular, NIV recoveries significantly improved compared to those obtained by using Mycosep #227 columns for clean-up of the extracts. Limits of detection in the various investigated matrices ranged 2.5-4.0 microg kg(-1) for NIV, 2.8-5.3 microg kg(-1) for DON, 0.4-1.7 microg kg(-1) for HT-2 and 0.4-1.0 microg kg(-1) for T-2. Mean recovery values, obtained from cereals and cereal products spiked with NIV, DON, HT-2 and T-2 toxins at levels from 10 to 1000 microg kg(-1), ranged from 72 to 110% with mean relative standard deviation lower than 10%. A systematic investigation of matrix effects in different cereals and cereal products was also carried out by statistically comparing the slopes of standard calibration curve with matrix-matched calibration curve for each of the four toxins and the eight matrices tested. For seven of the eight matrices tested, statistically significant matrix effects were observed, indicating that, for accurate quantitative analysis, matrix-matched calibration was necessary.

17874237,"This paper describes the extension of a previously published method based on liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) from 39 to currently 87 analytes. Besides the mycotoxins for which regulated concentrations exist, the method now comprises not only almost all mycotoxins for which standards are commercially available, but also a number of other important metabolites produced by fungi involved in food spoilage. The method is based on a single extraction step using an acidified acetonitrile/water mixture followed by analysis of the diluted crude extract. Method performance characteristics were determined after spiking breadcrumbs as model matrix at multiple concentration levels. With very few exceptions, coefficients of variation of the whole procedure of <5% and repeatabilities at the highest spiking level of <7% were obtained. Limits of detection ranged between 0.02 and 225 microg kg(-1). The quantitative determination of ergopeptides was disturbed by epimerization due to the acidic conditions. From the remaining 77 analytes, the apparent recoveries of nine substances deviated significantly from the CEN target range of 70-110% due to incomplete extraction and/or matrix effects. In principle, the latter can be compensated for by the application of matrix-matched calibration. The developed method was applied to 18 moldy samples (including bread, fruits, vegetables, jam, cheese, chestnuts and red wine) from private households. This study revealed the great value of the described method: 37 different fungal metabolites were identified at concentrations of up to 33 mg kg(-1), and some of these have never been reported before in the context of moldy food products.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002853', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005658', 'D053719']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Fungi', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",A liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric multi-mycotoxin method for the quantification of 87 analytes and its application to semi-quantitative screening of moldy food samples.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379']","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17874237,2008

We studied whether urinary metabolites of AA could be candidate biomarkers of AA intake and internal dose in mice following dietary crisp bread administration or sc injection. The crisp bread was experimentally baked to contain three different concentrations of AA: 0.19, 1.02, and 2.65 mg/kg, giving dietary exposures to AA of 0.024 +/- 0.002, 0.14 +/- 0.02, and 0.29 +/- 0.04 mg/kg bodyweight (bw)/day (mean +/- SD), respectively. A linear relationship was found between dietary AA exposure and urinary AA metabolites. On average, 55% of the ingested dose was recovered as urinary AA metabolites, and the molar proportions between the urinary metabolites showed similar proportions for the different doses. Urine AA metabolites were measured after sc injection of AA at doses of 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg bw, and the urinary recovery for the three lowest doses was 54%. With the highest dose, 80% was recovered in urine, and the changed pattern of urinary metabolites indicated saturation of the metabolic conversion of AA to glycidamide. These results indicate that urinary metabolites of AA are good biomarkers of AA intake and internal dose up to 5 mg/kg bw/day. After sc injection of [(14)C]AA, 92% of the radioactivity was found in the urine and 2% in feces, liver, blood, and intestinal content (6% was not detected), demonstrating that sc AA was highly systemically available, that the major part AA metabolites was excreted, and that a significant portion of urinary AA metabolites (most likely glyceramide) was not accounted for by the present analytical method.

Higher levels of BaP were detected in fried chicken (5.25-5.55 BaP microg/kg) and smoked dried beef (5.47 microg/kg) compared to relatively lower levels measured in sesame oil (0.36 microg/kg) and peanut (0.44 microg/kg).

Proteins from flour with short-tearing gluten, including the water-soluble and salt-soluble fraction, had a loose spatial structure. Gluten fractions of this gluten (gliadin and glutenin) were characterized by a more compact and elongated structure compared to normal gluten.

Samples taken at all refreshment steps were used for determination of the present microbiota. Furthermore, an extensive metabolite target analysis of more than 100 different compounds was performed through a combination of various chromatographic methods including liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The establishment of a stable microbial ecosystem occurred through a three-phase evolution within a week, as revealed by both microbiological and metabolite analyses. Strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus rossiae, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus paraplantarum were dominating some of the sourdough ecosystems. Although the heterofermentative L. fermentum was dominating one of the wheat sourdoughs, all other sourdoughs were dominated by a combination of obligate and facultative heterofermentative taxa. Strains of homofermentative species were not retrieved in the stable sourdough ecosystems. Concentrations of sugar and amino acid metabolites hardly changed during the last days of fermentation. Besides lactic acid, ethanol, and mannitol, the production of succinic acid, erythritol, and various amino acid metabolites, such as phenyllactic acid, hydroxyphenyllactic acid, and indolelactic acid, was shown during fermentation. Physiologically, they contributed to the equilibration of the redox balance.

Immunological (R5 antibody-based sandwich and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and R5 antibody-based Western blot), two-dimensional electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight, strong-cation-exchange-liquid chromatography/capillary liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight [SCX-LC/CapLC-ESI-Q-TOF], and high-pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry) analyses were used to determine the gluten concentration. Assays based on the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and gamma interferon production by PBMCs and intestinal T-cell lines (iTCLs) from 12 celiac disease patients were used to determine the protein toxicity of the pepsin-trypsin digests from fermented wheat dough (sourdough). As determined by R5-based sandwich and competitive ELISAs, the residual concentration of gluten in sourdough was 12 ppm. Albumins, globulins, and gliadins were completely hydrolyzed, while ca. 20% of glutenins persisted. Low-molecular-weight epitopes were not detectable by SCX-LC/CapLC-ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry and R5-based Western blot analyses. The kinetics of the hydrolysis of the 33-mer by lactobacilli were highly efficient. All proteins extracted from sourdough activated PBMCs and induced gamma interferon production at levels comparable to the negative control.

Hydrolysis was investigated either by the use of baker's yeast bread treated with digestive enzymes and VSL#3, an experimental design that mimicked the activity of probiotics during gut colonization, or by the use of VSL#3 as a starter for dough fermentation, an experimental design that mimicked the predigestion of wheat flour proteins during food processing. Albumins, globulins, and gliadins extracted from wheat flour and chemically acidified and started dough and total proteins extracted from breads were analyzed by immunoblotting with pooled sera from patients with an allergy to wheat. Hydrolysis of wheat flour proteins was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). Mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization-time of flight was used to identify some immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding proteins. As shown by immunoblotting with sera from allergic patients, several IgE-binding proteins persisted after treatment of baker's yeast bread by pepsin and pancreatin. The signal of all these IgE-binding proteins disappeared after further treatment by VSL#3. As shown by SDS-PAGE and related immunoblotting and 2DE analyses, when VSL#3 was used as a starter for bread making, it caused a marked degradation of wheat proteins, including some IgE-binding proteins such as the putative transcription factor APFI and wheat alpha-amylase inhibitors.

17203506,"Wheat proteinaceous alpha-amylase inhibitors (alpha-AIs) are increasingly investigated for their agronomical role as natural defence molecules of plants against the attack of insects and pests, but also for their effects on human health. The wheat genomes code for several bioactive alpha-AIs that share sequence homology, but differ in their specificity against alpha-amylases from different species and for their aggregation states. Wheat alpha-AIs are traditionally classified as belonging to the three classes of tetrameric, homodimeric and monomeric forms, each class being constituted by a number of polypeptides that display different electrophoretic mobilities. Here we describe a proteomic approach for the identification of bioactive alpha-AIs from wheat and, in particular, a 3-D technique that allows to best identify and characterize the dimeric fraction. The technique takes advantage of the thermal resistance of alpha-AIs (resistant to T > 70 degrees C) and consists in the separation of protein mixtures by 2-D polyacrylamide/starch electrophoresis under nondissociating PAGE (ND-PAGE, first dimension) and dissociating (urea-PAGE or U-PAGE second dimension) conditions, followed by in-gel spontaneous reaggregation of protein complexes and identification of the alpha-amylase inhibitory activity (antizymogram, third dimension) using enzymes from human salivary glands and from the larvae of Tenebrio molitor coleopter (yellow mealworm). Dimeric alpha-AIs from Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) were observed to exist as heterodimers. The formation of heterodimeric complexes was also confirmed by in vitro reaggregation assays carried out on RP-HPLC purified wheat dimeric alpha-AIs, and their bioactivity assayed by antizymogram analysis. The present 3-D analytical technique can be exploited for fast, full-fledged identification and characterization of wheat alpha-AIs.",Electrophoresis,"['D000818', 'D002851', 'D019281', 'D015180', 'D006801', 'D010940', 'D020543', 'D012469', 'D013712', 'D014908', 'D000516']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dimerization', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Plant Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Salivary Glands', 'Tenebrio', 'Triticum', 'alpha-Amylases']",Full-fledged proteomic analysis of bioactive wheat amylase inhibitors by a 3-D analytical technique: Identification of new heterodimeric aggregation states.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000201', 'Q000201', 'Q000737', 'Q000037']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'enzymology', 'enzymology', 'chemistry', 'antagonists & inhibitors']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17203506,2007

17151887,"One of the major factors contributing to the failure of new wheat varieties is seasonal variability in end-use quality. Consequently, it is important to produce varieties which are robust and stable over a range of environmental conditions. Recently developed sample preparation methods have allowed the application of FT-IR spectroscopic imaging methods to the analysis of wheat endosperm cell wall composition, allowing the spatial distribution of structural components to be determined without the limitations of conventional chemical analysis. The advantages of the methods, described in this paper, are that they determine the composition of endosperm cell walls in situ and with minimal modification during preparation. Two bread-making wheat cultivars, Spark and Rialto, were selected to determine the impact of environmental conditions on the cell-wall composition of the starchy endosperm of the developing and mature grain, focusing on the period of grain filling (starting at about 14 days after anthesis). Studies carried out over two successive seasons show that the structure of the arabinoxylans in the endosperm cell walls changes from a highly branched form to a less branched form. Furthermore, during development the rate of restructuring was faster when the plants were grown at higher temperature with restricted water availability from 14 days after anthesis with differences in the rate of restructuring occurring between the two cultivars.",Planta,"['D002473', 'D004777', 'D012639', 'D013055', 'D013997', 'D014908']","['Cell Wall', 'Environment', 'Seeds', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Time Factors', 'Triticum']",The effect of environment on endosperm cell-wall development in Triticum aestivum during grain filling: an infrared spectroscopic imaging study.,"['Q000378', None, 'Q000166', None, None, 'Q000166']","['metabolism', None, 'cytology', None, None, 'cytology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17151887,2007

It could be demonstrated that acrylamide content in bread strongly depends on the cultivar, with extremes differing by a factor of 5.4 due to marked differences in free asparagine and crude protein contents. Nitrogen fertilization also resulted in elevated amino acid and protein contents, thus increasing acrylamide levels from 10.6 to 55.6 mug/kg. Independent of fertilization, harvest year turned out to be another factor influencing acrylamide formation. Breads produced from 2003 flours showed significantly higher acrylamide contents than those of 2004, which was ascribed to favorable light and temperature conditions during the cultivation period, thus enhancing amino acid and protein contents. Sprouting of the grain also resulted in significantly higher acrylamide levels, which was attributed to elevated enzyme activities and the formation of precursors from protein and starch.

The nature and shape of the pressure-area compression isotherms of the lipid monolayer in the presence of puroindolines in the subphase depended on the concentration of protein. A distinct phase separation occurred, when the concentration of protein in the subphase increased. The interfacial elasticity of the lipid monolayer in the presence of puroindolines in the subphase was higher than the pure lipid. Injection of protein beneath the preexisting lipid monolayer resulted in the increase of surface pressure due to the penetration of proteins. The extent of penetration depended on the nature of lipid head groups as well as on the initial surface pressure. The penetration of puroindolines to lipid monolayer was observed to be zero after crossing a critical initial surface pressure. The magnitude of the critical initial surface pressure for anionic lipids was significantly higher than the zwitterionic and nonionic lipids.

16848540,"Binding of selected volatile butter flavor compounds to wheat vs soy-containing crackers was studied by inverse gas chromatography (IGC), sensory evaluation, and equilibrium sorption measurements. IGC data showed greater binding of gamma-butyrolactone and butyric acid to both types of crackers than either diacetyl or hexanal, possibly due to the involvement of stronger binding forces such as hydrogen bonding and even ionic forces in the case of butyric acid. The presence of soy proteins did not affect binding of diacetyl and hexanal but increased binding of strongly interacting compounds gamma-butyrolactone and especially butyric acid, probably through enhanced matrix polarity. In agreement with the IGC data, sensory evaluation results showed that the headspace aroma intensities were similar between the two diacetyl-flavored crackers, while they significantly differed between the butyric acid-flavored crackers.

16813309,"Sunn pest (or cereal bug) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae and Scutelleridae) infestations of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., in the grain filling stage have the potential to adversely affect the quality of harvested grain for bread making. In the absence of resistant wheat cultivars, producers must rely on chemical control to protect their crop from sunn pest infestations. To implement an efficient environment friendly control strategy, there is a need to pinpoint the relationships between the timing of the bug attack and gluten degradation. Recent outbreaks of Eurygaster maura (L.) in northwestern Italy have increased the local concern toward this problem. A 3-yr study was carried out by caging plants of two bread wheat cultivars, characterized by different seed texture and bread-making quality, and introducing adults of E. maura in four periods corresponding to different grain filling stages: heading, early milk-ripe, milk-ripe, and late milk-ripe. The degree of bread-making quality depletion was assessed by analytical and biochemical methods and related to the attack period. Using analysis of variance, significant differences were found in the quality traits of kernels attacked by E. maura in different grain filling stages, the maximum damage occurring with bug feeding at the late milk-ripe stage. Biochemical investigations on gluten confirmed analytical results; in grain samples infested at the late milk-ripe stage, SDS gel electrophoresis revealed the degradation of some components of the high-molecular-weight glutenins, and high-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed a breakdown of the first peak of the insoluble fraction, mainly containing polymeric proteins highly related to dough strength.",Journal of economic entomology,"['D000383', 'D000818', 'D001939', 'D020062', 'D006790', 'D012639', 'D013997', 'D014908']","['Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Bread', 'Heteroptera', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Seeds', 'Time Factors', 'Triticum']",Impact of Eurygaster maura (Heteroptera: Scutelleridae) feeding on quality of bread wheat in relation to attack period.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16813309,2006

16512258,"Simultaneous Determination of Vitamins.--Klejdus et al. described a simultaneous determination of 10 water- and 10 fat-soluble vitamins in pharmaceutical preparations by liquid chromatography-diode-array detection (LC-DAD). A combined isocratic and linear gradient allowed separation of vitamins in 3 distinct groups: polar, low-polar, and nonpolar. The method was applied to pharmaceutical preparations, fortified powdered drinks, and food samples, for which results were in good agreement with values claimed. Heudi et al. described a separation of 9 water-soluble vitamins by LC-UV. The method was applied for the quantification of vitamins in polyvitaminated premixes used for the fortification of infant nutrition products. The repeatability of the method was evaluated at different concentration levels and coefficients of variation were <6.5%. The concentrations of vitamins found in premixes with the method were comparable to the values declared. A disadvantage of the methods mentioned above is that sample composition has to be known in advance. According to European legislation, for example, foods might be fortified with riboflavin phosphate or thiamin phosphate, vitamers which are not included in the simultaneous separations described. Vitamin B2.--Viñas et al. elaborated an LC analysis of riboflavin vitamers in foods. Vitamin B2 can be found in nature as the free riboflavin, but in most biological materials it occurs predominantly in the form of 2 coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Several methods usually involve the conversion of these coenzymes into free riboflavin before quantification of total riboflavin. According to the authors, there is growing interest to know flavin composition of foods. The described method separates the individual vitamers isocratically. Accuracy of the method is tested with 2 certified reference materials (CRMs). Vitamin B5.-Methods for the determination of vitamin B5 in foods are limited because of their low sensitivity and poor selectivity. Pakin et al. proposed a post-column derivatization of pantothenic acid as a fluorescent compound and used this principle in a specific and sensitive method for the determination of free and bound pantothenic acid in a large variety of foods. A French laboratory invited European laboratories to participate in a series of collaborative studies for this method, which will be carried out in 2005/2006. A more sophisticated method was described by Mittermayer et al. They developed an LC-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method for the determination of vitamin B5 in a wide range of fortified food products. Application of the method to various samples showed consistent results with those obtained by microbiology. Vitamin B6.-Method 2004.07, an LC method for the analysis of vitamin B6 in reconstituted infant formula, was published by Mann et al. In contrast with this method, which quantifies vitamin B6 after converting the phosphorylated and free vitamers into pyridoxine, Viñas et al. published an LC method which determines 6 vitamin B6 related compounds, the 3 B6 vitamers, their corresponding phosphorylated esters, and a metabolite. Accuracy was determined using 2 CRMs. Results were within the certified ranges. Vitamin C.-Franke et al. described an extensive study to vitamin C and flavonoid levels of fruits and vegetables consumed in Hawaii. Vitamin C was determined by measuring ascorbic acid in its reduced state by LC and coulometric detection along with UV absorbance detection at 245 nm. No attempts were made to assess levels of dehydroascorbic acid. Most recent research revealed that cell uptake of dehydroascorbic acid is unlikely to play a major role, which may explain the very low vitamin C activity of orally administered L-dehydroascorbic acid in rats. The food levels found by Franke et al. are variably lower, higher, or equal in comparison to other studies. Iwase described a method for the determination of ascorbic acid in foods using L-methionine for the pre-analysis sample stabilization. Electrochemical detection was used for the quantification. Traditionally, metaphosphoric acid was proven to be a useful dissolving agent for the determination of ascorbic acid. However, it dissolves in water very slowly, it is hygroscopic, and accurate weighing is not easy. Adjustment at pH 2-3 takes a long time. It appeared to be possible to replace metaphosphoric acid by 0.2% phosphoric acid. Methionine played an important role on the stability of ascorbic acid. The method seemed to be applicable to the routine analysis of ascorbic acid in foods. Folic Acid.-Microbiological analysis of total folate in foods is often considered as the golden standard compared to other methods based on, for example, LC. Koontz et al. showed results of total folate concentrations measured by microbiological assay in a variety of foods. Samples were submitted in a routine manner to experienced laboratories that regularly perform folate analysis fee-for-service basis in the United States. Each laboratory reported the use of a microbiological method similar to the AOAC Official Method for the determination of folic acid. Striking was, the use of 3 different pH extraction conditions by 4 laboratories. Only one laboratory reported using a tri-enzyme extraction. Results were evaluated. Results for folic acid fortified foods had considerably lower between-laboratory variation, 9-11%, versus >45% for other foods. Mean total folate ranged from 14 to 279 microg/100 g for a mixed vegetable reference material, from 5 to 70 microg/100 g for strawberries, and from 28 to 81 microg/100 g for wholemeal flour. One should realize a large variation in results, which might be caused by slight modifications in the microbiological analysis of total folate in foods or the analysis in various (unfortified) food matrixes. Furthermore, optimal combination of enzymes and reaction conditions may vary depending on the composition of the food. Padrangi and Laborde showed recently that treatment with alpha-amylase had no significant effect on measured folate in spinach, although addition of protease significantly increased the release of folate. LC/MS applications gain increasing attention because of their specificity. Rychlik used stable isotope dilution assays for the determination of the folate content of broccoli and bread. Compared to data in the literature and food data bases, amounts were significantly lower. Pawlosky et al., however, found comparable values for 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid and folic acid by HPLC analysis with fluorescent detection and HPLC/MS. Among samples analyzed were CRMs and broccoli. Besides folic acid, other water-soluble vitamins were also determined by LC/MS/MS by Leporati et al. The method was applied to the quantitative analysis of the natural content of vitamins in typical Italian pasta samples, as well as in fortified pasta samples produced for the U.S. market. Biotin.-A paper from Staggs et al. included the assertion that existing biotin data in food composition tables are inaccurate because the majority are based on bioassays with all relevant disadvantages. Data in most cases are overestimated with consequences for recommendations for dietary biotin intake. An HPLC/avidin-binding assay was used to analyze 87 foods to support the hypothesis mentioned.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002623', 'D002853', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005527', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D020349', 'D025101', 'D014815', 'D014867']","['Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Food, Fortified', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Vitamin B 6', 'Vitamins', 'Water']",Water-soluble vitamins.,"['Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['methods', None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512258,2006
16438318,"Acrylamide is formed in high-carbohydrate foods during high temperature processes such as frying, baking, roasting and extrusion. Although acrylamide is known to form during industrial processing of food, high levels of the chemical have been found in home-cooked foods, mainly potato- and grain-based products. This chapter will focus on the effects of cooking conditions (e.g. time/temperature) on acrylamide formation in consumer-prepared foods, the use of surface color (browning) as an indicator of acrylamide levels in some foods, and methods for reducing acrylamide levels in home-prepared foods. As with commercially processed foods, acrylamide levels in home-prepared foods tend to increase with cooking time and temperature. In experiments conducted at the NCFST, we found that acrylamide levels in cooked food depended greatly on the cooking conditions and the degree of ""doneness"", as measured by the level of surface browning. For example, French fries fried at 150-190 degrees C for up to 10 min had acrylamide levels of 55 to 2130 microg/kg (wet weight), with the highest levels in the most processed (highest frying times/temperatures) and the most highly browned fries. Similarly, more acrylamide was formed in ""dark"" toasted bread slices (43.7-610.7 microg/kg wet weight), than ""light"" (8.27-217.5 microg/kg) or ""medium"" (10.9-213.7 microg/kg) toasted slices. Analysis of the surface color by colorimetry indicated that some components of surface color (""a"" and ""L"" values) correlated highly with acrylamide levels. This indicates that the degree of surface browning could be used as an indicator of acrylamide formation during cooking. Soaking raw potato slices in water before frying was effective at reducing acrylamide levels in French fries. Additional studies are needed to develop practical methods for reducing acrylamide formation in home-prepared foods without changing the acceptability of these foods.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"['D020106', 'D000178', 'D002241', 'D002853', 'D003296', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D019649', 'D006358', 'D013058', 'D008956', 'D035281', 'D011198', 'D013696', 'D013997']","['Acrylamide', 'Acrylamides', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cooking', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Food Industry', 'Hot Temperature', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Models, Chemical', 'Plant Tubers', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",Effects of consumer food preparation on acrylamide formation.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16438318,2006
16438316,"Many bakery products sold in the UK such as crumpets, batch bread and Naan might be expected to show high levels of acrylamide because they have strong Maillard colours and flavours. However, analysis of commercial products has shown that the highest levels of acrylamide are seen in dry biscuit type products. With the exception of spiced products such as ginger cake, moist high sugar products (e.g. cakes and fruit loaves) show relatively low levels of acrylamide, even in darkly browned crusts. This is in contrast to bread where acrylamide levels in excess of 100 microg/kg are common in the crust region, but are diluted by low levels in the crumb. Acrylamide levels in bread are significantly raised by domestic toasting, but other products such as crumpets and Naan bread have been found to be less sensitive. A mathematical model has been developed (and validated against tests on model dough) which shows that once obvious recipe differences are allowed for, the key factor limiting acrylamide levels is crust moisture.

16362275,"A previous study in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) identified two candidate genes controlling a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) GluBx. These candidates were Glu-B1-1, the structural gene coding for Glu1Bx, and the B homoeologous gene coding for SPA (spa-B), a seed storage protein activator. The goal of this study was to identify the best candidate gene for this QTL. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are an abundant source of DNA polymorphisms that have been successfully used to identify loci associated with particular phenotypes. As no linkage disequilibrium was detected between Glu-B1-1 and spa-B, we performed an association study to identify the individual gene responsible for the QTL. Six SNPs, three located in Glu-B1-1 and three in spa-B, were genotyped by mass spectrometry in a collection of 113 bread wheat lines. These lines were also evaluated for protein content as well as the total quantity of HMW-GSs and of each HMW-GS in seed samples from two harvest years.

The within-laboratory reproducibility meets the official performance criteria for verifying 3-MCPD at the 20 microg kg(-1) limit stipulated by the European Community for soy sauce. The limit of quantification was below 5 microg kg(-1) for all the foodstuffs analysed. This method offers a valuable alternative to the draft CEN European Standard: instead of diethyl ether, much safer ethyl acetate is used; derivatization is more selective; and reagents are common stable chemicals. This method was successfully applied to toasted bread, savoury crackers, cheese, soups, including vegetable-based soups, meat products such as salami, vegetable oils, sauces, soy sauce and related products. Upon checking the method performance in the case of vegetable oils, the unexpected presence of monobromopropanediols was detected.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D001939', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D005990', 'D010938', 'D011409', 'D015203', 'D045730', 'D000517']","['Bread', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Glycerol', 'Plant Oils', 'Propylene Glycols', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Soy Foods', 'alpha-Chlorohydrin']","Determination of 3-chloropropane-1,2-diol as its 1,3-dioxolane derivative at the microg kg-1 level: application to a wide range of foods.","['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000031', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods', 'analogs & derivatives', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16356881,2006

The occurrence of acrylamide in food matrices devoid of common precursors such as meat supports an additional formation pathway. Gluten was recovered from wheat flour by water extraction. Starch, reducing sugars and amino acids were removed using alpha-amylase and NaCl solution and were completely absent in the purified gluten fraction. The gluten was dry heated at temperatures ranging from 160 to 240 degrees C for 8 to 12 min and analyzed for acrylamide and cinnamic amide using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Acrylamide could be detected up to 3997 microg/kg gluten dry weight. Cinnamic amide was detected and unambiguously identified in the gluten samples, thus confirming the proposed formation of acrylamide from proteins. After gluten addition to bread roll dough, protein pyrolysis to form acrylamide in the complex food matrix was assessed. Contents of asparagine and reducing sugars were diminished due to the addition of the gluten. In contrast to the expectation with respect to the well-established common formation mechanism of acrylamide, it increased from 53.4 to 63.9 microg/kg (+20%), which was in good correlation with the higher proportion of gluten. As demonstrated by the t-test, the increase in acrylamide was significant when comparing 0 and 15% gluten addition. Additionally, cinnamic amide could be found in crusts of bread rolls.

15912342,"Chromosome 7E from Lophopyrum ponticum carries a valuable leaf rust resistant gene designated Lr19. This gene has not been widely used in common wheat breeding because of linkage with the yellow pigment gene Y. This gene tints flour yellow, reducing its appeal in bread making. However, a high level of yellow pigment is desirable in durum wheat breeding. We produced 97 recombinant chromosomes between L. ponticum transfer 7D.7E#1 and its wheat homoeologues, using the ph1b mutation that promotes homoeologous pairing. We characterized a subset of 37 of these lines with 11 molecular markers and evaluated their resistance to leaf rust and the abundance of yellow pigment. The Lr19 gene was mapped between loci Xwg420 and Xmwg2062, whereas Y was mapped distal to Xpsr687, the most distal marker on the long arm of chromosome 7. A short terminal 7EL segment translocated to 7A, including Lr19 and Y (line 1-23), has been transferred to durum wheat by backcrossing. The presence of this alien segment significantly increased the abundance of yellow pigment. The Lr19 also conferred resistance to a new durum leaf rust race from California and Mexico that is virulent on most durum wheat cultivars. The new durum lines with the recombinant 7E segment will be useful parents to increase yellow pigment and leaf rust resistance in durum wheat breeding programs. For the common wheat breeding programs, we selected the recombinant line 1-96, which has an interstitial 7E segment carrying Lr19 but not Y.

The method consisted of the release of protein-bound dityrosine by hydrolysis in 4 mol/L hydrochloric acid/8.9 mol/L propionic acid for 24 h at 110 degrees C after addition of the internal standard, cleanup by C(18) solid-phase extraction, and HPLC-MS/MS. The limit of detection of dityrosine was 80 ng/g of sample (0.22 nmol/g), and the limit of quantitation was 270 ng/g of sample (0.75 nmol/g). The method was sensitive enough to analyze wheat flour and dough and to study the effect of flour improvers on the dityrosine content. Furthermore, the effect of the mixing time was studied. The dityrosine concentration in the flour was 0.66 nmol/g. After we mixed a dough to peak consistency, the dityrosine concentration doubled and remained constant on further mixing. Overdoses of hydrogen peroxide and hexose oxidase (HOX, E.C. 1.1.3.5) resulted in a strongly increased dityrosine content, whereas no increase of the dityrosine concentration was found after the addition of ascorbic acid and potassium bromate. Calculation of the percentage of dimeric tyrosine showed that less than 0.1% of the tyrosine residues of wheat protein were cross-linked. Therefore, dityrosine residues seem to play only a very minor role in the structure of wheat gluten.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000429', 'D000975', 'D001205', 'D001939', 'D001959', 'D002851', 'D005433', 'D006861', 'D013058', 'D016877', 'D014908', 'D014443']","['Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Antioxidants', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Bread', 'Bromates', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flour', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oxidants', 'Triticum', 'Tyrosine']",Quantitation of dityrosine in wheat flour and dough by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,"['Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000032', 'Q000494', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000494', 'Q000379', 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000031']","['pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'analysis', 'pharmacology', 'methods', 'analysis', 'pharmacology', 'methods', 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'analogs & derivatives']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15796572,2005
15764332,"Norharman and harman are two heterocyclic beta-carboline (9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole) alkaloids with biological and potential toxicological activity that appear in foodstuffs and environmental sources. To assess the occurrence and distribution of these compounds and to estimate the exposure levels based on the detected amounts, numerous samples of foodstuffs and cigarette smoke were analysed by solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence. The levels found of beta-carbolines were highly variable. Low processed foodstuffs (i.e. milk, yoghurt, uncooked meats and fish) did not contain norharman and harman above the detection limit. Others, however, contained relatively high concentrations (at the tens of ng g(-1) or microg l(-1) level) depending on the processing conditions as, for example, 'well-done' cooked meat and fish. The highest amounts of norharman and harman were found in brewed coffee (29-207 microg l(-1)), sauces (soy sauce and Tabasco, among others; 4-252 microg l(-1)), 'well done' cooked meat and fish (57-160 ng g(-1)), toasted bread (42-160 ng g(-1)), and fermented alcoholic beverages (n.d.-41 mug l(-1)). beta-Carbolines also occurred in a high amount in the mainstream of cigarette smoke (207-2780 ng/cigarette), which is an important contributor to daily exposure to these compounds. Based on these results, it is concluded that the daily exposure to beta-carbolines in humans might be from tens to hundreds of micrograms, with cigarette smoke, coffee, certain seasonings, cooked foods and alcoholic beverages, in this order, being the major contributors. Many other foodstuffs might also contribute with minor amounts of norharman and harman.

15763665,"In this work, we first investigated if the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Albimonte can be defined as ""shoot cadmium excluder""--by comparing the cadmium (Cd) content in leaves and roots and by calculating the shoot-to-root Cd concentration ratio. Furthermore, we evaluated if the exposure to Cd excess could generate oxidative stress in leaves and roots of this cv., in terms of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) accumulation, NAD(P)H oxidation rate, and variations in reduced glutathione (GSH) content and peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7) activity. Finally, we surveyed possible quali- quantitative differences in thiol-peptide compound pattern between roots and leaves, in order to verify whether phytochelatins (PCs) and related thiol-peptides could contribute in limiting the Cd-induced oxidative stress. Unambiguous characterisation of PCs and related forms present in the root samples was obtained by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and ESI-tandem MS (ESI-MS/MS). Our results indicate that in leaves the stress generated by the low accumulation of Cd (due to a moderate translocation in planta) seems to be counteracted by the antioxidant response and by the PC biosynthesis. On the contrary, in roots, in spite of the elevated presence of PCs and related thiol-peptide-compounds, the excess of Cd causes a decline in the antioxidant protection of the organ, with the consequent generation of considerable amounts of H(2)O(2), a direct agent of oxidative stress.",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,"['D002104', 'D004789', 'D005978', 'D006861', 'D013058', 'D008667', 'D009249', 'D018384', 'D009195', 'D054811', 'D018515', 'D018517', 'D014908']","['Cadmium', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metalloproteins', 'NADP', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Peroxidase', 'Phytochelatins', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Roots', 'Triticum']",Oxidative stress and phytochelatin characterisation in bread wheat exposed to cadmium excess.,"['Q000633', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000502', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000187']","['toxicity', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'physiology', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15763665,2005

The analysis was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) using deuterium-labeled acrylamide as internal standard. Acrylamide was stable in most matrixes (cookies, cornflakes, crispbread, raw sugar, potato crisps, peanuts) over time. However, slight decreases were determined for dietary biscuits (83-89%) and for licorice confection (82%). For coffee and cacao powder, a significant decrease occurred during storage for 3 or 6 months, respectively. Acrylamide concentrations dropped from 305 to 210 microg/kg in coffee and from 265 to 180 microg/kg in cacao powder. On the contrary, acrylamide remained stable in soluble coffee as well as in coffee substitutes. Reactions of acrylamide with SH group-containing substances were assumed as the cause for acrylamide degradation in coffee and cacao. Spiking experiments with acrylamide revealed that acrylamide concentrations remained stable in baby food, cola, and beer; however, recovery levels dropped in milk powder (71%), sulfurized apricot (53%), and cacao powder (17%).

About 70 components were detected in each of the fractions examined by the combined use of these two techniques, with 18 components common to both fractions. Analysis of the fractions after alkylation with 4-vinylpyridine allowed determination of the number of the cysteines present in about 40 subunits. The proteins detected were tentatively classified based on the relative molecular masses and number of cysteine residues. Cross-contamination was found in both B- and C- fractions, along with the presence of D-type LMW-GS.

To investigate the folate status in young Japanese women (n=340, 20-22 y), I determined the serum folate and total homocysteine (tHcy), and examined the influence of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism on folate status in a subgroup of 252 of the women. I calculated folate consumption based on records of food intake weighed over 3 d using the standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan (5th revised edition) and the US Food Composition Table based on the USDA nutrient database excluding fortification. Serum folate and total homocysteine (tHcy) levels were determined by chemiluminescent-competitive protein binding assay and HPLC, respectively.

The main sources of dietary folate were vegetables, green tea and bread. Serum folate levels were significantly correlated with folate intake (r=0.249, p<0.001). Serum tHcy levels were above 15 micromol/L in four participants.

H. pomatia was selected from several enzymes based on its ability to hydrolyze isolated lignan glucosides. After ether extraction samples were analyzed and quantified against secoisolariciresinol-d8 and matairesinol-d6. The method was optimized using model products: broccoli, bread, flaxseed, and tea.

We report the development of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to identify bread wheat genotypes carrying HMW glutenin allele composition of Glu-1 complex loci (Glu-A1, Glu-B1 and Glu-D1) by capillary electrophoresis(CE) with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. Two triplex primer sets of HMW glutenin subunit genes were examined. An automated and rapid CE-LIF technique is helpful in the multiplex PCR optimization process. Two fluorescent intercalating dyes (EnhanCE, and YO-PRO-1) are compared for detection of DNA fragments. Amplified DNA fragments of HMW glutenin Glu-1 genes were well separated both by agarose slab-gel electrophoresis and CE, and revealed minor differences between the sequences of 1Ax2*, 1Axnull, 1Bx6, 1Bx7, 1Bx17 and 1Dx5 genes. Moreover, CE technique requires samples of smaller volumes in comparison to slab-gel electrophoresis, and data can be obtained in less than 20 min.

Bidi17) of bread wheat were conducted using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC/ESI-MS). For all three proteins, MALDI-TOFMS analysis showed that the isolated fractions contained a second component with a mass about 650 Da lower than the major component. The testing and correction of the gene-derived amino acid sequences of the three proteins were performed by direct MALDI-TOFMS analysis of their tryptic peptide mixture. Analysis of the digest was performed by recording several MALDI mass spectra of the mixture at low, medium and high mass ranges, optimizing the matrix and the acquisition parameters for each mass range. Complementary data were obtained by RP-HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of the tryptic digest. This resulted in coverage of about 98% of the sequences. In contrast to the gene-derived data, the results obtained demonstrate the insertion of the sequence QPGQGQ between Trp716 and Gln717 of subunit 1Bx7 (cv.

In order to relate the incorporation and distribution of foliar N and S fertilisers at the post-anthesis stage to the quality of wheat, 15N and 34S isotopes were used as tracers. The incorporation of these tracers in different plant parts (leaves, stems, ears) and in each storage protein fraction (gliadins, HMW and LMW glutenin subunits) was determined by isotopic ratio mass spectrometry coupled with an elemental analyser (EA-IRMS). By this means, the true recovery coefficient of N and S (TRCNfertiliser and TRCSfertiliser) and the N and S derived from fertilisers (Ndff and Sdff) could be determined. The TRCNfertiliser and TRCSfertiliser values of the different plant parts provide evidence of the applied N and S assimilation and translocation from wheat leaves to the seeds. The determination of Ndff and Sdff incorporated into storage proteins shows the efficiency and the influence of N and S incorporation into each storage protein fraction. Moreover, a favourable stage for fertiliser application can be determined by the TRCNfertiliser values in the grain and in the whole plant.

For the determination of the high molecular weight thiols, a method was developed that involved derivatization of dough with Ellman's reagent, removal of excess reagent by dialysis, micro-Osborne fractionation, release of the label by reduction, and determination of reduced Ellman's reagent by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Mixing of flour without AA led to a decrease of the glutathione and an increase of the cysteine concentration.

At the beginning of stem elongation, wheat plants were caged regardless of the presence or absence of indigenous cereal aphids. Half of the caged plants were artificially infected with Diuraphis noxia. The number of D noxia and Rhopalosiphum padi individuals on plants destined for flour preparation was approximately 150 aphids per tiller at peak population. The number of Sitobion avenae individuals was ca 25 aphids per tiller. Bread-making quality of wheat flour is determined primarily by the protein content, the gluten proteins (gliadins, glutenins) being the prime factors. The absolute amounts and/or the relative proportion of gliadins and glutenins are very important in dough making and in determining baking quality. Flour from grains originating from plants infected naturally with cereal aphids indigenous to Hungary, and flour infected artificially with D noxia, were analysed for glutenin and gliadin content using size exclusion HPLC. It was found that aphid infection had a significant effect on the gliadin/glutenin ratio, which was significantly lower in wheat flour prepared from aphid-infected plants than in that from uninfected control. The most significant decrease in gliadin/glutenin ratio was caused by D noxia infection, followed by R padi and then S avenae. As the gliadin/glutenin ratio was significantly lower in flour made from aphid-infected wheat seeds, it can be supposed that aphid feeding results in decreased bread making quality of wheat flour.",Pest management science,"['D000818', 'D001042', 'D002851', 'D005433', 'D005903', 'D005983', 'D014908']","['Animals', 'Aphids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flour', 'Gliadin', 'Glutens', 'Triticum']",Glutenin and gliadin contents of flour derived from wheat infested with different aphid species.,"[None, 'Q000254', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000031', 'Q000378']","[None, 'growth & development', None, 'analysis', 'metabolism', 'analogs & derivatives', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12701703,2003

For both proteins, MALDI-TOFMS analysis showed that the isolated fractions contained a second component with a mass about 500-540 Da lower than the major component. The testing and correction of the gene-derived amino acid sequences of both proteins were performed by direct MALDI-TOFMS analysis of their tryptic peptide mixture and analysis of the digests was performed by recording several MALDI mass spectra of the mixture at low, medium and high mass ranges, optimising the matrix and the acquisition parameters for each mass range. Complementary data were obtained by RP-HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of the tryptic digest. This resulted in the coverage of the whole protein sequences except for two short fragments (T1 and T8), which are identical in the two homologous subunits, and for an additional dipeptide (T14) in subunit 1Dy12, which were not detected. It also demonstrated that, in contrast to the gene-derived data, the sequence of subunit 1Dy12 does not include the dipeptide Gly-Gln between residues Gln(454) and Pro(455), and that the lower mass components present in both fractions correspond to the same sequences lacking short peptides that are probably lost from the protein N- or C-termini.

Fruits and vegetables are the rich sources of these vitamins. However, there are considerable cooking losses of vitamins, and information on vitamin contents of cooked foods is essential for assessing the adequacy of vitamin intakes. Secondly, there is a growing trend to consume ready-to-eat foods such as stuffed pancakes (samosa, patties), pastries, French fries; replacing traditional foods for lunch or dinner like roti, vegetable curry, bread, non-vegetarian items. Ready-to-eat foods are considered to give empty calories rather than a balanced diet. A study was undertaken to estimate ascorbic acid, folic acid, riboflavin, thiamine and beta-carotene of 263 cooked food samples and 260 meals representing dietary patterns of Asia, Africa, Europe, USA and Latin America by spectrophotometry and photoflurometry. A broad range of beta-carotene (84-2038 mcg%), riboflavin (0.01-0.48 mg%), thiamine (0.04-0.36 mg%), vitamin C (1-28 mg%) and folate (26-111 mcg%) was observed in individual foods. Bakery products and sweets were found to be poor sources and green leafy vegetables and fruits were good sources of these five vitamins.

EPS production during sourdough fermentation has the potential to affect rheological properties of the dough as well as the volume, texture, and keepability of bread. Its in situ production by L. sanfranciscensis LTH2590 was demonstrated during sourdough fermentation after the hydrolysis of water soluble polysaccharides. In wheat and rye doughs with sucrose addition the concentration of fructose in the hydrolysate of polysaccharides was significantly higher than that in the hydrolysate of control doughs or doughs without sucrose addition. EPS production by L. sanfranciscensis in wheat doughs was confirmed by the determination of delta (13)C values of water soluble polysaccharides after the addition of naturally labeled sucrose, originating from C(3)- and C(4)-plants. In rye doughs, evidence for EPS production with the isotope technique could be demonstrated only by the determination of delta (13)C values of fructose from water soluble polysaccharides. In addition to EPS formation from sucrose, sucrose hydrolysis by L. sanfranciscensis in wheat and rye sourdoughs resulted in an increase of mannitol and acetate concentrations and in accumulation of glucose.

11588904,"The tocopherols, the major vitamers of vitamin E, are believed to play a role in the prevention of human aging-related diseases such as cancer and heart disease, yet little is known concerning determinants of their plasma concentrations. Evidence from animal studies suggests that the dietary source of gamma-tocopherol can significantly affect plasma levels of this tocopherol as well as its functional vitamin E activity. To determine whether plasma levels of tocopherols in humans are similarly altered, a study was undertaken in which subjects (n = 9) were fed muffins containing equivalent amounts of gamma-tocopherol from sesame seeds, walnuts, or soy oil. We observed that consumption of as little as 5 mg of gamma-tocopherol per day over a three-day period from sesame seeds, but not from walnuts or soy oil, significantly elevated serum gamma-tocopherol levels (19.1% increase, p = 0.03) and depressed plasma beta-tocopherol (34% decrease, p = 0.01). No significant changes in baseline or postintervention plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, or carotenoids were seen for any of the intervention groups. All subjects consuming sesame seed-containing muffins had detectable levels of the sesame lignan sesamolin in their plasma.

Glutenin subunits have no definitive structural differences that can be directly correlated to their ability to form gluten and affect dough formation or breadmaking quality. Many protein structural studies, as well as mixing and baking studies, have postulated that disulfide bonds are present in the gluten structure and contribute to the process of dough formation through the process of disulfide-sulfhydryl exchange.

However, the role of dietary intake of BaP and cancer in humans is not clear. We created a BaP database of selected food products that could be linked to Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs) to estimate BaP intake. BaP levels were measured for each food line-item (composite samples) which consisted of a variety of foods in a FFQ. Composite sample parts were derived from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) which represents the most common food items consumed by the general population. Meat samples were cooked by different techniques in controlled conditions, and by various restaurants and fast-food chains. Non-meat products were purchased from the major national supermarket chains. The quantities of BaP were measured using a thin-layer chromatography (TLC)/spectrofluorometer technique and were highly correlated with both BaP (r=0.99) [corrected] and sum of carcinogenic PAH (r=0.98) measured by HPLC technique. We linked our database to the results from a FFQ and estimated the daily BaP intake of various food items in 228 subjects in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The highest levels of BaP (up to about 4 ng BaP/g of cooked meat) were found in grilled/barbecued very well done steaks and hamburgers and in grilled/barbecued well done chicken with skin. BaP concentrations were lower in meats that were grilled/barbecued to medium done and in all broiled or pan-fried meat samples regardless of doneness level. The BaP levels in non-meat items were generally low. However, certain cereals and greens (e.g. kale, collard greens) had levels up to 0.5 ng/g. In our population, the bread/cereal/grain, and grilled/barbecued meat, respectively, contributed 29 and 21 percent to the mean daily intake of BaP.

The spectra recorded on flour samples, obtained from seeds of four bread and five durum wheats, show high-intensity absorption bands due to aromatic amino acids of wheat proteins and low-intensity bands due to chromophores bound to low-molecular-weight compounds. The intensity of these last bands is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding chromophores present in the flour; thus, it can be used to measure the content of the compounds containing the chromophore(s). In particular, a quantitative determination of the carotenoids actually present in the flours is made, obtaining information on the original content of the seeds. This determination is important, as, for example, xanthophylls are well-known antioxidants and free-radical scavengers involved in aging processes of seeds. Reflectance measurements on powder samples are far more economic in terms of time and materials consumption than methods such as extraction and HPLC analysis of extracts and, in addition, give an evaluation of the overall content of carotenoids with absorption bands in the spectral range 450-500 nm.

The trichothecenes deoxynivalenol (DON), 3- and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-,15-ADON), nivalenol (NIV), fusarenon-X (FUS-X), T-2 toxin (T-2) and HT-2 toxin (HT-2) were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry following clean-up by a two stage solid-phase extraction. Detection limits ranged between 2 and 12 micrograms/kg. Based on all samples, the incidence of DON, HT-2, T-2, 3-ADON, 15-ADON, and NIV was at 71, 18, 4, 4, 4 and 2%, respectively; the average contents in positive samples were at 103, 16, 14, 17, 24 and 109 micrograms/kg, respectively. Fus-X was not detected in any sample. A lower (P < 0.05) DON content was found in baby and infant foods as well as in cookies and cakes compared to bread. Overall, based on the incidence and level of all six toxins, the degree of contamination was lowest in baby and infant foods. Foods produced from either white or whole grain flour did not differ (P > 0.05) with regard to the incidence and level of DON. In foods produced from cereals of organic production both the incidence and median content of DON was lower compared to conventional production.

10858697,"This paper reports the compilation of a food composition database for phylloquinone (vitamin K1) derived from the direct analysis of foods, recipe calculation and the assignment of values based on food similarities. All the basic and other food items used in these calculations had been analysed by HPLC and about 170 of the items had been obtained and assayed in the UK. Recipe calculations took account of the cooking method and changes in water and fat content. Currently, approximately 1501 food items with Royal Society of Chemistry/Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food food codes have been allocated a vitamin K1 value, and a further 282 new recipe codes are included in the database. Representative values from each food group are reported together with an indication of the potential variation. Detailed examples of some recipe calculations are included, and also the impact of changing the type of fat in recipes. Vitamin K1 is associated with, and most abundant in, photosynthetic tissues of plants. Accordingly, the highest concentrations (3000-6000 micrograms/kg) are found in dark-green leafy vegetables and herbs, such as kale, parsley, spinach and green cabbage. Intermediate concentrations (1000-2000 micrograms/kg) are found in plants with paler leaves such as white cabbage and lettuce or in green, non-leafy vegetables such as broccoli and brussel sprouts. Fats and oils contain variable amounts of vitamin K1 with the highest concentrations (300-1300 micrograms/kg) in soyabean, rapeseed and olive oils and the margarines based on them. Other foods such as dairy products, meat dishes and cereal-based foods (bread, biscuits, cakes, desserts etc.), although not in themselves particularly rich in vitamin K1 (< 200 micrograms/kg), may contribute significantly to intakes when consumption of green vegetables is poor.

EPR spectroscopy of orange-brown melanoidins, which were isolated from heated aqueous solutions of bovine serum albumin and glycolaldehyde, revealed the protein-bound 1,4-bis(5-amino-5-carboxy-1-pentyl)pyrazinium radical cation (CROSSPY) as a previously unknown type of cross-linking amino acid leading to protein dimerization. To verify their formation in foods, wheat bread crust and roasted cocoa as well as coffee beans, showing elevated nonenzymatic browning, were investigated by EPR spectroscopy. An intense radical was detected, which, by comparison with the radical formed upon reaction bovine serum albumin with glycolaldehyde, was identified as the protein-bound CROSSPY.

Samples were analyzed for carbohydrates and organic acids using high-performance liquid chromatography. Analytical data for each food were pooled and compared to the results of the sugar food. The amount of lactic acid produced 30 min after ingestion was highest with the potato chips and lowest with the corn flakes. Potato starch contributed more readily to oral lactic acid production than wheat or corn starch. A direct linear relationship existed between lactic acid production and the presence of oral glucose produced from starch, which occurred via the metabolites maltotriose and maltose.

Data on mothers' milk FA and dietary habits which allowed food selection were recently published (Rocquelin et al., 1998). Most foods were locally produced. Food samples were collected at local markets, bleached if necessary to avoid microbial degradation, and stored at +4 degrees C or -20 degrees C. They were lyophilized upon their arrival in the laboratory before lipid analyses. FA composition of food lipids was determined by capillary gas chromatography. Staple diets included low-fat, high-carbohydrate foods (processed cassava roots, wheat bread) and high-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) foods: soybean oil (high in 18 : 2 n-6 and alpha-18 : 3 n-3), bushbutter (dacryodes edulis), peanuts, avocado (high in fat and 18 : 2 n-6), freshwater and salt-water fish (high in LC n-3 and/or n-6 PUFA), and leafy green vegetables (low in fat but very high in alpha-18 : 3 n-3). Their frequent consumption by nursing mothers provided enough EFA to meet requirements due to lactation. It also explains why mothers' breast milk was rich in C8-C14 saturated FA (26% of total FA) and in n-6, n-3 PUFA (respectively 15.0% and 2.4% of total FA) highly profitable for breastfed infants' development.

The objective of this study was to develop molecular markers associated with the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) putatively conferring durable leaf rust resistance in Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell. A population of 77 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from 'Parula' (resistant) and 'Siete Cerros' (moderately susceptible) was used. Bulked segregant analysis was done using random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) with DNA enriched for low-copy sequences using hydroxyapatite chromatography. Out of 400 decamer primers screened, 3 RAPD markers were identified between the bulk of the most resistant and the bulk of the most susceptible lines. These were cloned and used as probes on the RILs in Southern hybridizations. Two probes revealed two tightly linked loci. One-way analysis of variance showed that these two loci, and another revealed by the third probe, were linked to QTLs controlling leaf rust resistance based on data taken from 2 years of replicated field trials. Cytogenetic analysis placed the two tightly linked loci on the long arm of chromosome 7B. The third probe detected loci located on the short arms of chromosomes 1B and 1D. It is suggested that the QTL detected on 7BL may well be homoeoallelic to Lr34.",Genome,[],[],Detection of quantitative trait loci associated with leaf rust resistance in bread wheat.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18464825,2012

8937567,"An enzymatic method is described for measuring L-dehydroascorbic acid in perchloric acid extracts of biological samples. The enzyme used in the assay was glutathione dehydrogenase (glutathione:dehydroascorbate oxidoreductase), which was purified from wheat flour using three column chromatography steps. The enzyme catalyzes the reduction of dehydroascorbic acid by glutathione, and the ascorbic acid product is measured spectrophotometrically at 265 nm. The assay is a fast (about 2 min) and simple two-step procedure. First, a mixture of extract and buffer is set to zero absorbance against air in a spectrophotometer. Second, a solution of glutathione dehydrogenase and glutathione is added and the absorbance after 2 min is used in a formula to calculate nmol dehydroascorbic acid/g or ml sample [513.8(Abs-0.013) x factor for dilution of extract]. The formula was derived from a calibration graph using pure L-dehydroascorbic acid standards. Pure L-dehydroascorbic acid was prepared from pure L-ascorbic acid, and the ascorbate oxidase used to catalyze the reaction was removed by ultrafiltration. Commercial L-dehydroascorbic acid (Aldrich) was unsuitable for use as a standard because the purity was only 56-67% in comparison to laboratory-prepared L-dehydroascorbic acid. The sensitivity of the assay was such that when dehydroascorbic acid was added to healthy human blood plasma during extraction with perchloric acid at the level of 7.5 nmol/ml plasma the dehydroascorbic acid could be measured with complete recovery. Low levels of dehydroascorbic acid were detected in fresh fruits and vegetables.

Each sample was inoculated with a toxigenic strain of Penicillium verrucosum and monitored for ochratoxin A formation. When ochratoxin A had reached a level of 60 micrograms/kg, the samples were milled into ten fractions which were analysed for ochratoxin A by an HPLC method with immunoaffinity column clean-up. Each straight-run white flour was baked into bread which was analysed in the same way. Relationships between ochratoxin A levels in naturally-contaminated wheat and the products of milling and baking were established. The recovery of ochratoxin A in wholemeal compared with the cleaned wheat was essentially complete and no significant loss occurred on baking white or wholemeal flour into bread. Recoveries in the straight-run white flours, however, were only approximately one-third for the hard wheat and two-thirds for the soft wheat of the ochratoxin A in the uncleaned wheat. The reason for this was that a much higher proportion of the ochratoxin A was found in the bran and offal fractions from hard wheat than from soft. Conversely, a much higher proportion of the ochratoxin A was found in the reduction flour from soft wheat than from hard. Scouring was examined as a possible method of decontamination of wheat prior to milling. This process removes a proportion of the pericarp (bran coat) prior to milling.

7571865,"Spelt wheat (Triticum spelta L.) has not been investigated for the toxicity on coeliac disease patients until now. Because clinical studies are out of considerations for ethical reasons, spelt wheat and coeliac-active bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were compared by the analysis of N-terminal sequences of alpha-gliadins, which have been proposed to be responsible for the toxic effect. The gliadin fractions of the spelt wheats 'Roquin' and 'Schwabenkorn' and of the bread wheat 'Rektor' were preparatively separated by RP-HPLC and major alpha-gliadin components were then compared by N-terminal sequence analysis. The results did not reveal any significant difference between spelt and bread wheats within the first 25 positions. For the determination of sequences further from the N-terminus, the gliadin fractions of the spelt wheats were hydrolyzed with pepsin and trypsin. The resulting peptides were successively separated by gel permeation chromatography and RP-HPLC. Those peptides derived from the N-terminal part of alpha-gliadins were identified by reference peptides isolated previously from bread wheat [this journal 194: 229 (1992)]. Retention times upon RP-HPLC and amino acid compositions of corresponding peptides confirmed the identity of spelt and bread wheat concerning the N-terminal sequences of alpha-gliadins from position 3 to 56. For these reasons, it can be concluded that spelt wheat is a coeliac-toxic cereal and has to be avoided by coeliac patients.",Zeitschrift fur Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung,"['D000595', 'D002446', 'D002851', 'D005903', 'D006801', 'D008969', 'D010446', 'D013045', 'D014908']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Gliadin', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Species Specificity', 'Triticum']",[Spelt wheat and celiac disease].,"[None, 'Q000503', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000145']","[None, 'physiopathology', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'classification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7571865,1995
7596676,"There is limited information on the bioavailability of Fe in infant weaning foods, mainly because of the difficulties of measuring Fe utilization directly in infants. The aim of this study was to develop a safe and relatively noninvasive method for studying Fe bioavailability (measured as percent Fe incorporation into red blood cells) in infants using 54Fe, 57Fe, and 58Fe stable isotopes. Four commonly used weaning foods were selected for study, labeled extrinsically with 57Fe- or 58Fe-enriched ferrous sulfate, and fed to five female and five male 9-mo-old fasting infants, using a multiple-dosing technique. Each food was given three times, labeled with one isotope, with a fruit juice drink containing 50 mg of ascorbic acid, and three times, labeled with a different isotope, with an ascorbic acid-free drink. Fourteen days after the last test meal, a blood sample was obtained from a heel-prick, spiked with a known amount of 54Fe, digested, and purified by ion exchange; isotopic enrichment and total Fe content were measured by quadrupole thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The proportion of administered dose of isotope circulating in the blood was calculated from an estimate of blood volume. The geometric mean bioavailability (range) was 3.0% (1.2-9.5%) in a proprietary dehydrated vegetable product, 3.0% (1.1-21.2%) in Weetabix whole-wheat breakfast cereal, 3.1% (1.2-15.4%) in wholemeal bread, and 4.3% (1.7-10.3%) in baked beans.

7517165,"The selenium concentration in foods grown and consumed and in plasma, red blood cells, and toenails of people living in the district of Chita in the transbaikalian part of Russia were studied in August 1991. Preliminary results from the area have suggested low selenium intakes and the possible occurrence of cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease) in the population. A low selenium concentration in foods grown locally was found: mean selenium concentration in wheat grains was 1, 5, and 28 micrograms/kg, respectively, in three villages studied, that of oats was between 3-6 micrograms/kg, and of cow's milk 10-27 micrograms/kg dry matter. The selenium concentration of bread was considerably higher, between 87-337 micrograms/kg dry wt, presumably because wheat imported from the US had been used for baking. Occasional samples of pork, beef, and mutton contained between 32-218 micrograms selenium/kg dry wt. Low selenium concentrations were observed in samples of soil and river water. The mean plasma selenium concentration of 52 persons was 1.02 mumol/L, including 33 children and 19 adult subjects. The selenium concentrations in red blood cells and toenails were 1.95 mumol/L and 0.61 mg/kg, respectively. No symptoms of heart disease caused by selenium deficiency were observed. It is concluded that the selenium status of people was fairly good thanks to the contribution to dietary intake of imported wheat with a high selenium content.

The sample was at first digested with mixture of concentrated acids (H2SO4 + HNO3 + HClO4) in teflon vessels and then finished in platinum dishes. Solutions of the destroyed samples was kept in polethylene bottles. The methods was checked by recovery tests. In the 8-hydroxyguinoline-extraction-method about 88.5% to 106.5% of the added aluminium was determined and in the AAS method it was of 75% to 100%. The highest level of aluminium was found in the eas: from 445 to 1522 mg/kg (mean 879 mg/kg) and then in herb-fruit teas (consisting of dried herbs and fruits of sloe plum, briar-rose juneberry Aronia etc.) from 45 to 379 mg Al/kg of dry matter.

The optimum experimental conditions for colour development have been assessed. Absorbance measurements were made at 529 nm in the presence of 0.4% m/V citric acid. The calibration graph was linear for 0-6 micrograms ml-1 of sorbic acid with a slope of 0.131 A micrograms-1 ml. The recoveries of sorbic acid at concentrations of 164-557 micrograms ml-1 ranged from 96 to 103%.

3120804,"Durum wheat proteins have been considered as a model because of the very clear-cut relationship previously evidenced between the electrophoretic type '42' or '45' of the components that are coded by the Gli-B1 chromosome locus and the intrinsic quality (gluten viscoelasticity) of cultivars. The proteins from 4 cultivars were subjected to sequential extraction and separated into five groups, respectively, in: NaCl, EtOH (gliadins-I), EtOH + mercaptoethanol (ME) (gliadins-II), AcOH + ME (glutenins-I) and SDS + ME (glutenins-II) and characterized using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), SDS-PAGE and 2-dimensional (NEPHGE X SDS - PAGE) electrophoretic systems. EtOH-soluble fractions were also separated by ion-exchange chromatography, each fraction being characterized in PAGE and SDS-PAGE and its composition in major bands determined by densitometry. From the ratio of each chromatographic fraction and of each solubility group, an estimation of the major bands or electrophoretic zones was also made in respect to the whole proteins. In 'type 45' cultivars, it was shown that only 67% of the EtOH-soluble fraction (although considered as classical gliadins) had a monomeric character, giving rise to discrete bands in PAGE systems. The remainder (33%) were aggregated fractions, essentially those referred to as low molecular weight glutenins (LMWG), that migrate, upon reduction only, in SDS-PAGE systems. LMWG make up 27% of total proteins and are revealed as a strong triplet in the 44,500-51,500 MW region, in gliadin-I and especially in gliadin-II groups. In type '42' cultivars, the LMWG ratio is reduced about by half (18% of EtOH soluble fraction, 14% of total proteins). This difference, coupled with their aggregative behavior, leads to their consideration as the major functional markers of gluten quality, gliadins 42/45 being genetic markers only. Without excluding possible physicochemical differences between different LMWG allelic types, it is hypothesized that quantitative differences could explain by themselves the quality differences between the two durum wheat genetic types. Concerning the other aggregative fractions, like high molecular weight glutenin (HMWG) subunits in glutenin-I and II groups, they do not show (unlike bread wheats) quantitative or qualitative differences large enough to play a major role in explaining genetic differences in durum wheat gluten characteristics. It is recommended, especially for physicochemical studies of wheat quality, to rely on a protein classification based on monomeric or aggregative characteristics, instead of Osborne's scheme based only on fractionation by solubility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Biochimie,"['D002852', 'D003720', 'D004548', 'D004591', 'D005903', 'D005983', 'D008970', 'D010940', 'D014908', 'D014783']","['Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Densitometry', 'Elasticity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gliadin', 'Glutens', 'Molecular Weight', 'Plant Proteins', 'Triticum', 'Viscosity']",Characterization and quantification of low molecular weight glutenins in durum wheats.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3120804,1988

The carcinogenicity of NMAMBA was shown by the induction of forestomach carcinomas and liver tumors in mice and rats. Another new nitrosamine, N-2-methylpropyl-N-methylacetonyl nitrosamine, was isolated in millet and wheat flour after similar treatment. Some species of fungi not only can reduce nitrates to nitrites but also can increase the amount of secondary amines in the moldy foods and provide favorable conditions for the synthesis of nitrosamines. Some fungi may utilize primary amines to synthesize nitrosamines in appropriate culture mediums. Furthermore, the cornmeal may naturally contain trace amounts of nitrosamines, as detected by a gas chromatography/thermoenergy analyzer. Prolonged feeding of F. moniliforme-inoculated cornbread alone also induced the development of forestomach carcinoma in rats. This indicates the occurrence of potential carcinogens, perhaps certain Fusarium mycotoxins, in the moldy cornbread in addition to the carcinogenic nitrosamines. Another nitroso compound, Roussin red methylester (di-mu-methanethiolatotetranitrosodiiron) was found in pickled vegetables that are eaten daily in the Linxian (China) area. Roussin Red may provide NO-2 ions, which would react readily with secondary amines to form nitrosamines.

Some fractionation took place during milling: up to two-fold increases in DON concentrations were observed in shorts and feed flour fractions, while lesser increases were found in the bran from wheat 2 (none for bran from wheat 1); there was some correlation of ash concentration with DON levels in the flour streams from GRL pilot milling of the two wheats.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D001939', 'D005433', 'D005516', 'D008401', 'D012717', 'D014255', 'D014908']","['Bread', 'Flour', 'Food Microbiology', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Trichothecenes', 'Triticum']",Distribution of the trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin) during the milling of naturally contaminated hard red spring wheat and its fate in baked products.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6537355,1985
6682077,"Human blood was examined for the presence of volatile nitrosamines. Nitrosamines were detected by chemiluminescence and mass spectrometry after separation from blood by distillation and solvent extraction. N-nitrosodimethylamine was detected in all but one of 51 blood samples taken from 23 different people, at concentrations from the detection limit (0.1 microgram/litre) to 1.4 microgram/litre with a mean concentration of 0.5 microgram/litre. N-Nitrosodiethylamine was detected in 11 samples, the detection limit being 0.1 microgram/litre. No other volatile nitrosamines were detected. After a test meal of bacon, spinach, bread and beer, the concentration of N-nitrosodimethylamine increased. There was no appreciable difference between the nitrosamine concentrations in the blood of laboratory workers and in the blood of other people. Salivary nitrite concentrations measured semi-quantitatively concurrently with blood sampling varied considerably but showed no apparent correlation with blood nitrosamine levels. Measurements in rabbits given a continuous infusion of N-nitrosodimethylamine gave a clearance rate approximately equal to the blood flow through the liver and a volume of distribution of 1.2 litre/kg body weight.

The aqueous incubation medium contained sodium nitrite (10 mg/l) and potassium thiocyanate to mimic the incoming flux of saliva, as well as pepsin, sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid, reflecting the composition of gastric juice. After incubation for 2 hr at 37 degrees C, volatile N-nitrosamines and N-nitrosamino acids were determined in the reaction mixtures. Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was present in the incubation mixtures of smoked mackerel (8.5 micrograms per portion), canned herring (0.66 micrograms per portion) and beer (0.70 micrograms per 'portion'). Smaller amounts per portion, sometimes of other nitrosamines as well, were observed with canned salmon and anchovy, mustard, yoghurt and coffee brew. Negative results were obtained for canned tuna, soya sauce, ketchup, white bread, 'nasi goreng', tea brew and cocoa milk. Nitrosamino acids were detected in the reaction mixtures of smoked mackerel (58 micrograms per portion), soya sauce (24 micrograms per portion) and canned salmon (6.9 micrograms per portion) and in smaller amounts in those of canned herring, anchovy and cocoa milk. In order to reduce the number of analyses to be performed, most products have been studied only after incubation, so that the nitrosamines and nitrosamino acids found may already have been present -- wholly or partly -- in the original products, before incubation.

1086165,"In the survey described by Al-Mufti et al. (see page 23) blood and hair samples were analysed for total mercury by modified atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The hair samples were divided into 2.5-cm segments and analysed consecutively. The mean blood levels were 34 ng/ml and 7 ng/ml, respectively in those who had and those who had not eaten contaminated bread.Corresponding mean maximum hair mercury values were 136 mug/g and 5 mug/g, respectively. Hair mercury values provided a better discrimination between different categories of exposure than blood mercury values at the time the survey was performed, some months after the end of the outbreak. Those persons who had not eaten contaminated bread but who lived in the area of high exposure had hair mercury values between the values of those who had eaten and those who had not eaten contaminated bread and who lived in the area of low exposure. Sequential estimation of mercury in 2.5-cm segments of hair in women gave information on the period of accumulation of mercury more than 1 year before the time of collection of the samples. It was possible to show an approximate relationship between the maximum hair mercury value and the amount of contaminated bread eaten. The match between the blood mercury level and the severity of poisoning was poor, owing to the length of time that had elapsed between the onset of poisoning and the sampling. With hair mercury, while the group results showed a good relation to the severity of poisoning, in individual cases the match was less good, especially in those persons where an insufficient length of hair was available for analysis.
