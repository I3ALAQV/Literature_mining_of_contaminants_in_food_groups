35206026,"Spices and aromatic herbs have always had great historical importance in human nutrition. Their use has been documented for centuries as a rich source of bioactive compounds; they have been used for their health benefits and also for flavoring or coloring food. However, despite the many health properties linked to the use of spices and aromatic herbs, these can represent biological hazards and can contain chemical substances of concern. Certainly, monitoring potential health hazards in spices and aromatic herbs includes microbiological safety and also the content of inorganic substances: both represent a key step. This research aims at monitoring the compliance of various spices and aromatic herbs from a non-European country market (namely: black cumin seeds, Iranian Tokhme Sharbati, clove buds, Shahjeera, Abbaszadeh saffron, organic fenugreek, whole black pepper, cinnamon, Abthul Ahmar (Asario), Ajwan seeds, whole coriander seeds, black sesame seeds, Sabja seeds) with the current European Union (EU) and WHO regulations, when available, regarding mineral and microbiological parameters. In particular, microbiological assays using rapid and conventional methods, and trace mineral determination by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were performed. Results show the safety of the tested spices, given that the microbiological parameters were within the legal microbiological criteria set by the European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2073/2005 and its amendment Regulation (EC) No. 1441/2007. With reference to potentially toxic Cd, Pb, As, Hg, these were within the limits set by the European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006 and its amendments, Regulation (EU) No. 1317/2021 and Regulation (EU) No. 1323/2021, and WHO. According to EU regulations, for Pb content, 2 samples out of 16 showed values different from the set limits.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Mineral and Microbiological Analysis of Spices and Aromatic Herbs.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35206026,2022
33241389,"Medicinal herbs are the ancient, traditional way of treating many diseases and are now considered the first natural source of pharmaceutical active ingredients. Therefore, it is very important to focus on the hygiene of these plants so as to make sure they are safe for consumption. This work aimed to monitor the common heavy and radioactive elements in some commonly used herbs: anise, chamomile, clover, cumin, coriander, fennel, roselle, rosemary, sage, and thyme. A total of 12 elements were measured including 2 radionuclides, Al, As, Cd, Hg, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, Sr, Th, U, and V. Heavy metals are ecologically and biologically important, and may be involved in some health disorder symptoms within the human body. Samples were digested with a microwave digester and measurements were completed with ICP-MS/MS in Helium mode to increase sensitivity, lower the background, and avoid interferences. Method validation and verification were performed through the spiking process at 2.0 µg/kg level, and then RSD, LOD, and LOQ were calculated. Recoveries ranged from 93-103% for all elements and RSD% from 2.8-9.6%. Hg and Th were not detected in all samples, while U was detected in some sample of anise, rosemary, sage, and thyme, and ranged from 0.018-0.048 mg/kg. As was detected in anise, fennel, roselle, and rosemary, and ranged from 0.0.031-5.88 mg/kg.

The method, named ionic liquid-based ultrasound-enhanced air-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction (IL-USE-AALLME), is based upon withdrawing and pushing out a mixture of an aqueous sample and an IL (as the extraction solvent) for several times into a conical test tube using a single syringe, placed in an ultrasound bath (as the enhancing mass transfer agent) during the extraction process. Different effective parameters were studied, and at the optimized conditions, limits of detection, linear dynamic ranges, and enrichment factors were ranged from 0.9 to 2.2 μg L(-1), 3.0 to 1023 μg L(-1), and 20 ± 2 to 22 ± 2, respectively. After optimization, the method was successfully applied to determine Pb(2+), Cu(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), and Cr(3+) in different biological (hair and nail), vegetable (coriander, parsley, and tarragon), fruit juice (apple, orange, and peach), and water (tap, mineral, and wastewater) samples.

25658149,"The analysis of aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1 and G2) and ochratoxin A (OTA) was performed in processed spices marketed in Penang, Malaysia, using immunoaffinity columns and HPLC equipped with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FD). The processed powdered spices analysed include dried chilli, fennel, cumin, turmeric, black and white pepper, poppy seed, coriander, 'garam masala', and mixed spices for fish, meat and chicken curry. Two different studies were carried out. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.01 ng g(-1) for each aflatoxin (AF) and 0.10 ng g(-1) for OTA (signal-to-noise ratio = 3:1). In the first study, 34 commercial processed spices analysed with a mean level, range and incidence of positive samples for total AF were 1.61 ng g(-1), 0.01-9.34 ng g(-1) and 85%, respectively, and for AFB1 were 1.38 ng g(-1), 0.01-7.68 ng g(-1) and 85%, respectively. The mean level, range and incidence of positive samples for OTA were 2.21 ng g(-1), 0.14-20.40 ng g(-1) and 79%, respectively. Natural co-occurrence of AF and OTA was found in 25 (74%) samples. In the second study of 24 commercial processed spices, the mean level, range and incidence of positive samples for total AF were 8.38 ng g(-1), 0.32-31.17 ng g(-1) and 88%, respectively, and for AFB1 were 7.31 ng g(-1), 0.32-28.43 ng g(-1) and 83%, respectively.

24779766,"Coriander, used as a common food seasoning, contains linalool as the main constituent of its essential oil. In this study, we tested the effect of linalool vis-à-vis that of a conventional chemotherapeutic drug, cyclophosphamide, against solid S-180 tumor-bearing Swiss albino mice. Tumor volume, cell count, cell cycle phase distribution, apoptosis, and proliferation markers indicate that linalool has potent antitumor activity. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that induction of oxidative stress might be responsible for the anticancer effect of linalool. However, interestingly, unlike cyclophosphamide, linalool did not induce myelosuppression or hepatotoxicity in mice as evident from bone marrow cell count, status of hepatic oxidative stress/antioxidant enzymes, and histopathology. Thus, linalool exerted prooxidant effect in tumor tissue and an antioxidant effect in liver. This is also supported by the expression of Nrf-2 and p21, which are considered to be important players in response to oxidative stress. Moreover, administration of linalool modulated the proliferation of spleen cells in tumor-bearing mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide. Finally, the detection of linalool in sera and tumor tissues by HPLC confirmed its bioavailability. In conclusion, linalool showed differential cytotoxicity towards tumor and normal cells in contrast to cyclophosphamide, which is uniformly toxic to both.

They could be contaminated by heavy metals in many ways including irrigation by sewage water and industrial effluents sewage sludge, vehicular emissions, industrial waste and atmospheric deposition. In this study, we sought to determine if some vegetables (cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, lettuce, potatoes, onions, carrots, persian leeks, dill, spinach, coriander, parsley) grown locally in the suburban of Isfahan city and sold in the urban markets are contaminated with cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb). Vegetables were sampled from August to October 2010. After washing, they were oven-dried and digested using three-acid mixture (70% HNO3, 65% HClO4 and 70% H2SO4). Analyzes of the heavy metals was performed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. To validate the assay method, intra-day and inter-day variation studies were performed. The concentrations (μg/g) of heavy metals in the samples ranged from 0.00 to 3.66 for Cd, 0.00 to 6.00 for Cr and 0.00 to 7.14 for Pb. The highest concentration of heavy metals was for Pb. The results showed that the amount of Cd, Cr and Pb of some samples exceeded the recommended levels. The amount of Cd in cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes with skin, carrots, and spinach was significantly higher in the samples collected from Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms than those of Dorche farms. Also, the amount of Cr in onion, carrots, and spinach was significantly higher in samples collected from Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms than those of Dorche farms. However, the amount of Pb in the carrots and leek was significantly higher in the samples collected from Dorche farms than those of Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms. It can be concluded from the findings of this study that the amounts of Cd, Cr, and Pb were higher than the acceptable levels recommended by WHO/FAO. Also, higher amount of Cd and Cr in some samples collected from Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms compared to that of the samples collected from Dorche farms may indicate the influence of contaminants that enter ZayadeRood River as it passes Isfahan.

The various components were identified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy. The effect of the various oil components on the viability of different cell lines (HepG2, Caco2, NIH3t3, MCF7 and Hek293) was examined using MTT assay. Linalool was the most potent and HepG2 cells the most sensitive. A 50% and 100% decrease in the viability of HepG2 was obtained at 0.4 microM and 2 microM linalool, respectively. Whereas none of the other components exerted a significant effect at concentrations lower than 50 microM, myrcene and nerolidol, the structural analogues of linalool, were more potent at 100 microM than the other components decreasing HepG2 viability to 26%. The biochemical effect of linalool on mitochondria isolated from HepG2 showed a concentration-dependent inhibition in complexes I and II activities of the respiratory chain, and a time-dependent decrease in ATP level. In addition, a time-dependent decrease in glutathione (GSH) level and in the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium was obtained, indicating increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Pretreatment with the antioxidants: N-acetyl cysteine (2mM), Trolox (100 microM) and different flavonoids (50 microM) was partially protective against the linalool-induced cell death; the most effective response was that of rutin and apigenin which restored 91% of HepG2 viability.

18622950,"Controversy exists regarding the possible protective role of carotenoids against cancer. Evidence is mainly against all-E-beta-carotene, while there is no evidence against other carotenoids or against mixtures of beta-carotene stereoisomers. Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets. Population consumption patterns of carotenoid isomers using a comprehensive database are used to improve our understanding in disease prevention.

14611155,"Crude vegetable oils are usually oxidatively more stable than the corresponding refined oils. Tocopherols, phospholipids (PL), phytosterols, and phenols are the most important natural antioxidants in crude oils. Processing of vegetable oils, moreover, could induce the formation of antioxidants. Black cumin (Nigella sativa L.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), and niger (Guizotia abyssinica Cass.) crude seed oils were extracted with n-hexane and the oils were further fractionated into neutral lipids (NL), glycolipids (GL), and PL. Crude oils and their fractions were investigated for their radical scavenging activity (RSA) toward the stable galvinoxyl radical by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry and toward 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical by spectrophotometric method. Coriander seed oil and its fractions exhibited the strongest RSA compared to black cumin and niger seed oils. The data correlated well with the total content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, unsaponifiables, and PL, as well as the initial peroxide values of crude oils. In overall ranking, RSA of oil fractions showed similar patterns wherein the PL exhibited greater activity to scavenge both free radicals followed by GL and NL, respectively. The positive relationship observed between the RSA of crude oils and their color intensity suggests the Maillard reaction products may have contributed to the RSA of seed oils and their polar fractions. The results demonstrate the importance of minor components in crude seed oils on their oxidative stability, which will reflect on their food value and shelf life.

Aspergillus flavus (24 isolates), and Aspergillus parasiticus (16 isolates) were the predominant aflatoxin-producing moulds isolated from both processed meat products and spices. Aflatoxins were absent in fresh meat, canned meat, salami, beefsteak and minced meat. The contamination of processed meat with aflatoxin was shown to correlate with the addition of spices to fresh meat.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D016604', 'D000348', 'D000818', 'D001230', 'D001231', 'D001232', 'D001234', 'D002855', 'D003212', 'D004534', 'D005516', 'D008460', 'D008461', 'D010407']","['Aflatoxin B1', 'Aflatoxins', 'Animals', 'Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'Aspergillus fumigatus', 'Aspergillus niger', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Condiments', 'Egypt', 'Food Microbiology', 'Meat', 'Meat Products', 'Penicillium']",Occurrence of aflatoxins and aflatoxin-producing moulds in fresh and processed meat in Egypt.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000302', 'Q000302', 'Q000302', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000302']","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', 'isolation & purification', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1778268,1992
2238837,"Chemical changes due to gamma-irradiation were investigated in 11 pure aroma compounds typically found in spices. Samples were irradiated with doses of 0, 10, and 50 kGy. The irradiation source was 60Co. Irradiated samples and unirradiated controls were analyzed by gas chromatography alone and coupled with mass spectrometry. Significant changes due to the irradiation occurred only in (+/-)-linalool and alpha-terpineol, which are typical components of, for example, coriander and bay leaf. Their total amounts decreased by about 4-13% and some minor peaks increased as a result of irradiation. However, different results may be obtained when the spices themselves are irradiated.",Zeitschrift fur Lebensmittel-Untersuchung und -Forschung,"['D002849', 'D003212', 'D005514', 'D005720', 'D008401', 'D009812', 'D009822']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Condiments', 'Food Irradiation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Odorants', 'Oils, Volatile']",The effects of gamma-irradiation on some pure aroma compounds of spices.,"[None, 'Q000528', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'radiation effects', None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2238837,1990
1698760,"A total of 244 samples of cereals (wheat flour, rice, and maize), pulses (arhar, moong, gram, lentil, and black gram), spices (turmeric, chili, coriander, and black pepper), vegetables (potato, onion, spinach, cabbage, brinjal, and tomato), fruits (mango, guava, apple, and grape), milk, butter, Deshi ghee, and edible oils (vegetable, mustard, groundnut, and sesame) collected from different cities of Northern Province (Utter Pradesh) were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography for the presence of organochlorine pesticide residues. Residues of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) were detected in about 85% of the total samples of cereals, spices, milk, butter, Deshi ghee, and edible oils analyzed in the present study. However, the residue levels were either very small (less than 0.06 ppm) or not detected at all in pulses, vegetables, and fruits as compared with very high concentrations in wheat flour (4.42 and 0.12 ppm), butter (1.19 and 4.85 ppm), mustard oil (1.26 and 2.42 ppm), Deshi ghee (1.10 and 3.84 ppm), vegetable oil (1.02 and 0.59 ppm), groundnut oil (0.51 and 1.49 ppm), and chili (0.48 and 1.92 ppm). The levels of HCH and DDT residues detected in rice, maize, turmeric, corlander, black pepper, and all the vegetables and fruits were also lower than those found in wheat flour, oil, and fat samples analyzed in the present study. These findings suggest that a restricted and controlled use of such persistent pesticides may be useful for decreasing their contamination levels in different food items.",Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,"['D000818', 'D002079', 'D002417', 'D002849', 'D003212', 'D003634', 'D002523', 'D005504', 'D005638', 'D001556', 'D007306', 'D008892', 'D009821', 'D010573', 'D014675']","['Animals', 'Butter', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Condiments', 'DDT', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Analysis', 'Fruit', 'Hexachlorocyclohexane', 'Insecticides', 'Milk', 'Oils', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Vegetables']","Organochlorine pesticide residues in different Indian cereals, pulses, spices, vegetables, fruits, milk, butter, Deshi ghee, and edible oils.","[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000031', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analogs & derivatives', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1698760,1990
3040629,"Seven different spices (thyme, cinnamon, coriander, caraway, pimento, paprika, black pepper) were treated by gamma radiation at an absorbed dose of 10 kGy, and the effect on chemical quality was determined. The effects of this dose were assessed by spectrophotometric analysis of some water-soluble constituents of spices (carbohydrates; carbonyl compounds) and on the content of water-insoluble steam-volatile oils. The colour of paprika and the content of piperine in pepper held in different packaging materials were measured in unirradiated and irradiated samples as a function of storage time. In all cases irradiation does not bring about any distinct qualitative or quantitative chemical changes based on spectrophotometric analysis of spice extracts.","International journal of radiation applications and instrumentation.
