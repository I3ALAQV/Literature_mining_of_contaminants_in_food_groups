36627477,"Technological advances and socioeconomic development of Bangladesh are leading to the best choice between branded and non-branded powdered spices. But toxic metal issues can be another factor to elect them. So lead (Pb) exposure and its consequence on the human body for these two categories of four common spices have been ascertained here. A validated laboratory method using hot plate digestion and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) has been used for that. The obtained mean concentration of Pb in branded and non-branded spice powders followed the decreasing order of turmeric > coriander > red chili > cumin powder and turmeric > red chili > cumin > coriander powder, respectively, where, in any analysis mode, the non-branded items are potentially ahead of Pb exposure. The market-based mean concentration between these two categories was not a significant difference (t-test). Approximately 90% of the spice samples have shown within the maximum allowable limit by Bangladesh Standard. The sum of estimated daily intake indicated that most of the city market (67%) for non-branded items and some branded (33%) samples have crossed the maximum tolerable daily intake (> 0.21 mg/kg). So, the human health risk assumption for the inhabitant of studied areas suggests there is no significant level of risk for them due to the consumption of spices regarding non-carcinogenic risk factor (THQ and total THQ) and carcinogenic risk factor (CR). But the development of a quality control process for loose spice powders as well as toxic metal screening from raw materials to finish products urgently needed and continuous monitoring with identifying the source of toxic metal is highly recommended.",Biological trace element research,[],[],Lead Exposure of Four Biologically Important Common Branded and Non-branded Spices: Relative Analysis and Health Implication.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36627477,2023

35206026,"Spices and aromatic herbs have always had great historical importance in human nutrition. Their use has been documented for centuries as a rich source of bioactive compounds; they have been used for their health benefits and also for flavoring or coloring food. However, despite the many health properties linked to the use of spices and aromatic herbs, these can represent biological hazards and can contain chemical substances of concern. Certainly, monitoring potential health hazards in spices and aromatic herbs includes microbiological safety and also the content of inorganic substances: both represent a key step. This research aims at monitoring the compliance of various spices and aromatic herbs from a non-European country market (namely: black cumin seeds, Iranian Tokhme Sharbati, clove buds, Shahjeera, Abbaszadeh saffron, organic fenugreek, whole black pepper, cinnamon, Abthul Ahmar (Asario), Ajwan seeds, whole coriander seeds, black sesame seeds, Sabja seeds) with the current European Union (EU) and WHO regulations, when available, regarding mineral and microbiological parameters. In particular, microbiological assays using rapid and conventional methods, and trace mineral determination by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were performed. Results show the safety of the tested spices, given that the microbiological parameters were within the legal microbiological criteria set by the European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2073/2005 and its amendment Regulation (EC) No. 1441/2007. With reference to potentially toxic Cd, Pb, As, Hg, these were within the limits set by the European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006 and its amendments, Regulation (EU) No. 1317/2021 and Regulation (EU) No. 1323/2021, and WHO.

Therefore, it is very important to focus on the hygiene of these plants so as to make sure they are safe for consumption. This work aimed to monitor the common heavy and radioactive elements in some commonly used herbs: anise, chamomile, clover, cumin, coriander, fennel, roselle, rosemary, sage, and thyme. A total of 12 elements were measured including 2 radionuclides, Al, As, Cd, Hg, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, Sr, Th, U, and V. Heavy metals are ecologically and biologically important, and may be involved in some health disorder symptoms within the human body.

To test this hypothesis, cumin was added to the maternal diet in the last month of gestation. Preference for artificial milk containing p-cymene, one of the chemosensory compounds of cumin, was tested within the first two days after birth in maternally deprived lambs born from mothers fed a cumin-flavored diet (Cumin group), or an unflavored diet (Control group). Aromatic profile of AF from cumin-fed mothers was analyzed by GC-MS/MS to determine whether p-cymene could be detected. While the control group avoided the flavored artificial milk on day 1, the Cumin group did not and showed a preference for the cumin-scented formula on day 2. GC-MS/MS profile of AF revealed that four of the main volatile cumin compounds, p-cymene, p-cymenene, β-pinene and γ-terpinene were present in variable amounts in all samples, p-cymene being the most frequently detected.

31029699,"The cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is one of the most important ectoparasites for livestock in tropical and subtropical areas around the world. This tick economically impacts cattle production by reducing weight gain and milk production. Moreover, it is a vector of pathogens causing diseases such as babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Conventional tick control relies mainly on the use of chemical acaricides; however, their intensive use has led to the rapid appearance of resistant tick populations. It is therefore necessary to look for alternative tick control products. In that sense, plant extracts might represent a promising source of new acaricides. Previously, we reported a significant acaricide effect of essential oils from selected plant species. In the present study, we used a mixture design approach to develop phyto-formulations by combining individual essential oils. We produced several mixtures at 10% containing different proportions of individual essential oils (ranging from 0 to 1) from cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), cumin (Cuminum cyminum) and allspice (Pimenta dioica) and tested their acaricidal activity against R. microplus ticks by means of larval packet test (LPT) and adult immersion test (AIT) assays. The optimal mixture predicted against R. microplus was composed of 66%, 17% and 17% of essential oils from C. zeylanicum, C. cyminum and P. dioica, respectively. We generated an estimated response surface contour plot that estimates 80%-100% acaricidal efficacy. In the optimal mixture 34 compounds were identified, which represent 98.65% of the total composition, with cinnamaldehyde (37.77%), β-caryophyllene (13.92%), methyl eugenol (12.27%) and cuminaldehyde (8.99%) being the major components. Next, we developed emulsions by combining the optimal mixture with several surfactants and determined particle size, Zeta potential, stability and bioactivity. Emulsions containing 2% and 5% Tween 20 or Tween 80 remain stable after 14 days at 54 °C. Finally, optimized emulsion retained a high acaricidal activity against larval and adult R. microplus ticks. Taken together, our findings showed the usefulness of mixture design method for the development of essential oil mixtures with potent acaricidal activity.

28300025,"The study was conducted to investigate matrix interferences using QuEChERS sample preparation to understand whether the dilution of matrix and/or the grouping of commodities can eliminate the need for selective individual matrix-matched standards in LC with tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis, and whether the calibration graph based on only one matrix can be used for quantification in the other matrixes. Matrix effects (MEs) were studied by comparing the slopes of calibration curves of the matrix-matched standards (diluted with mobile phase) vis-à-vis the solvent-based standards. The present study showed that MEs were dependent on the nature of both the commodity and the analyte. Among the test matrixes, the highest variability in ME was recorded in capsicum. Most of the pesticides showed signal suppression in tomato, capsicum, and cumin matrixes. In brinjal matrix, the signal of most of the pesticides showed slight enhancement. Due to the similar nature of the MEs in tomato and capsicum, these two commodities can be grouped together. Considering analyte variability, acetamiprid, 3-hydroxy carbofuran, dichlorvos, dimethoate, and spinosyn A and D showed no significant ME (≤20%) in tomato. Very high MEs (2360.9 and 1250.8%) were observed for quizalofop-p-tefuryl and tebuconazole, respectively. To check the effect of dilution in minimizing the ME, cucumber and brinjal matrixes were diluted 10×, and calibration curves were drawn with five concentration levels. It was found that about 60% of the total analyzed pesticides showed MEs ≤20%. In cumin, MEs ranged from -5.3% for triazophos to 661% for thiacloprid. Most of the pesticides showed recoveries in the acceptable range of 70-130% with calibration curves from both matrixes. To compensate for MEs, it is suggested that (1) tomato and capsicum matrixes, which show similar trends, can be grouped together; and (2) cucumber matrix, when diluted 10×, can be used to prepare calibration curves for the quantification of pesticides in various fruiting and cucurbit vegetable matrixes by LC-MS/MS.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002853', 'D005506', 'D010573', 'D017365', 'D053719', 'D014675']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Spices', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vegetables']",Evaluation of Matrix Effects in Multiresidue Analysis of Pesticide Residues in Vegetables and Spices by LC-MS/MS.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28300025,2017

Initial analyses also indicated the presence of almond. Subsequent research showed that the presence of peanut and almond did not fully explain the analytical results for the cumin samples. Using a combination of mass spectrometry, DNA-based methods (i.e., PCR and Sanger DNA Sequencing), microscopy, and antibody-based technologies (i.e., ELISA, Western blot analysis, and a novel xMAP multiplex assay) the presence of peanut was confirmed. Screening for secondary sources of adulteration (e.g., tree nuts, mahleb, peach, and cherry) supported the assessment that the cumin contained multiple contaminants.

The TAG structure ultimately determines the final physical properties of the oils and the position of FAs in the TAG molecule affects the digestion; absorption and metabolism; and physical and technological properties of TAGs. Fixed oils from the fruits of dill (Anethum graveolens), caraway (Carum carvi), cumin (Cuminum cyminum), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), anise (Pimpinella anisum), carrot (Daucus carota), celery (Apium graveolens), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), and Khella (Ammi visnaga), all from the Apiaceae family, were extracted at room temperature in chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) using percolators. Crude lipids were fractionated by solid phase extraction to separate neutral triacylglycerols (TAGs) from other lipids components. Neutral TAGs were subjected to transesterification process to convert them to their corresponding fatty acids methyl esters (FAMES) using 1% boron trifluoride (BF₃) in methanol. FAMES were analyzed by gas chromatography-quadrupole time of flight (GC-QTOF) mass spectrometry. Triglycerides were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight (LC-QTOF) mass spectrometry. Petroselinic acid was the major fatty acid in all samples ranging from 57% of the total fatty acids in caraway up to 82% in fennel.

No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, genistein and biochanin A.

14611155,"Crude vegetable oils are usually oxidatively more stable than the corresponding refined oils. Tocopherols, phospholipids (PL), phytosterols, and phenols are the most important natural antioxidants in crude oils. Processing of vegetable oils, moreover, could induce the formation of antioxidants. Black cumin (Nigella sativa L.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), and niger (Guizotia abyssinica Cass.) crude seed oils were extracted with n-hexane and the oils were further fractionated into neutral lipids (NL), glycolipids (GL), and PL. Crude oils and their fractions were investigated for their radical scavenging activity (RSA) toward the stable galvinoxyl radical by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry and toward 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical by spectrophotometric method. Coriander seed oil and its fractions exhibited the strongest RSA compared to black cumin and niger seed oils. The data correlated well with the total content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, unsaponifiables, and PL, as well as the initial peroxide values of crude oils. In overall ranking, RSA of oil fractions showed similar patterns wherein the PL exhibited greater activity to scavenge both free radicals followed by GL and NL, respectively. The positive relationship observed between the RSA of crude oils and their color intensity suggests the Maillard reaction products may have contributed to the RSA of seed oils and their polar fractions. The results demonstrate the importance of minor components in crude seed oils on their oxidative stability, which will reflect on their food value and shelf life.

Using Ames-test with Salmonella TA 98 and TA 100 proved high cytotoxic effects due to pure safrole and black pepper volatile oil in both of them. The degradation of safrole was obvious after drying of the washed seeds of black pepper especially at 70 degrees C for 30 min or with sun-drying. Also, high irradiation doses (20 and 30 kGy) caused high degradation of more than 90% of the initial toxic concentration in black pepper. Whereas, microwave caused same effects at 75 s, but unfortunately, the powder was burned due to moisture absence. Boiling whole seeds or powder of black pepper during cooking for few minutes (1-5 min) were more efficient in decreasing safrole content. Finally, these results proved that the mutagenicity of some spices due to presence of safrole can be destructed during drying of the washed seeds or during cooking either with or without any additional treatment as irradiation.
