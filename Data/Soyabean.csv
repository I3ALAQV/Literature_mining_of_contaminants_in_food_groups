35163533,"The need to feed 9.9 billion people by 2050 will require the coordination of farming practices and water utilization by nutrient-dense plants and crops. High levels of lead (Pb), a toxic element that can accumulate in plants, can lead to toxicity in humans. With the development of novel treatment technologies, such as atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) and engineered nanoparticles (NPs), the time to germination and levels of heavy metals in food and feed commodities can be reduced. This study provides insight into the impact of plasma-activated water (PAW) on the germination rates and effects of soybean seeds, and the resultant combination effects of zinc oxide uptake in the presence of lead. Soybean seedlings were watered with PAW (treated for 3, 5, and 7 min at 30, 50, and 70 kV), and the germination and growth rate were monitored for 10 days. The germinated seedlings were then grown hydroponically in a nutrient solution, and the biomass of each example was measured. The PAW treatment that resulted in the best growth of soybean seeds was then exposed to Pb and zinc-oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) to investigate heavy metal uptake in the presence of nanoparticles. After acid digestion, the rate of heavy metal uptake by the soybean plants was evaluated using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The PAW seeds grew and germinated more quickly, demonstrating that the plasma therapy had an effect. The rate of heavy metal uptake by the plants was also shown to be 5x lower in the presence of ZnONP.",International journal of molecular sciences,"['D000383', 'D018525', 'D018527', 'D053768', 'D019216', 'D058626', 'D036226', 'D012639', 'D013025', 'D013054', 'D015034']","['Agriculture', 'Germination', 'Hydroponics', 'Metal Nanoparticles', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Plasma Gases', 'Seedlings', 'Seeds', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Zinc Oxide']",Effect of High-Voltage Atmospheric Cold Plasma Treatment on Germination and Heavy Metal Uptake by Soybeans (,"[None, 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'drug effects', None, None, 'analysis', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35163533,2022
34465490,"Tempe is an Indonesian fermented food prepared from soybean or other non-soy legumes. Non-soy legumes based tempes have been reported to have a nutritional profile different from that of soybean-based tempe. However, a comprehensive study of the metabolite and sensory profiles of legume tempes has not been conducted. This study investigated the metabolite profile of legumes before and after fermentation using a metabolomic approach and its relation to the sensory profile. Four different legumes, namely red kidney bean, soybean, cowpea bean, and jack bean, and four kinds of tempe prepared from the abovementioned legumes were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. These tempe samples were fermented in two different production places, Japan and Indonesia. In total, 83 metabolites were annotated from all samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the samples were separated based on their type (legume and tempe) along PC1 with a 36.3% variance, in which sugars and amino acids significantly contributed to the separation. In addition, samples were separated along PC2 with a 17.2% variance based on the different production places. The combination of 75% soybean and 25% red kidney bean (75S:25R) could increase the concentrations of amino acids that were initially low in soybean tempe. The 75S:25R tempe showed no significant differences in taste and texture preference compared to the 100% soybean tempe, based on sensory result. These findings provide evidence that metabolomics could be used to identify the differences between tempes from different legumes.",Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,"['D007887', 'D005285', 'D008401', 'D007214', 'D055432', 'D045730', 'D013025']","['Fabaceae', 'Fermentation', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Indonesia', 'Metabolomics', 'Soy Foods', 'Soybeans']",Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling and sensory profile of Indonesian fermented food (tempe) from various legumes.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465490,2021
34152133,"Unintentional missing of shrimp and soybean allergen information on precautionary food allergen labeling often occurs in sauce products. To avoid food allergies, sensitive and time-saving analytical methods are urgently needed. However, the currently reported methods usually employed labeled peptides for isotope internal standard quantitation, and the matrix effect caused by protein extraction or digestion can not be corrected. In this study, a labeled peptide-free standard addition method was developed for simultaneous determination of shrimp and soybean in sauce products using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Through the rational selection of stable peptides, satisfying mean recoveries and relative standard deviations of the chosen peptides are achieved. The limit of quantifications of each peptide ranged from 0.25 to 5 μg tropomyosin/g sauce and from 1 to 10 μg Gly m 6/g sauce, respectively. Using the labeled peptide-free UHPLC-MS/MS method, not only ideal experimental results were obtained surpassing those obtained with labeled peptides, but also the reagents were economized and shortening of the sample preparation time was achieved.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000485', 'D002851', 'D010455', 'D013025', 'D053719']","['Allergens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Peptides', 'Soybeans', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Labeled Peptide-Free UHPLC-MS/MS Method Used for Simultaneous Determination of Shrimp and Soybean in Sauce Products.,"[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152133,2021
33729245,"Plant-based drinks as a substitute for animal milk consumption are crucial products in the food industry. Soy and rice drinks are the most successful milk substitutes but are low in fiber and protein contents, respectively, whilst being rich in sugars. Generally, an improvement is foreseen; thus, apart from supplement addition, a natural occurring strategy is functionalizing the drinks by beneficial bacteria fermentation. The aim of this work is to develop novel plant-based drinks assessing different mixtures of soy and rice milks fermented with single or multi-strain probiotics (Lactobacillus fermentum, L. plantarum, L. helveticus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and B. longum). The drinks were characterized to study bacterial performances, by means of culture-dependent and -independent techniques, and their volatilome, by means of solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) analysis. Through multivariate analysis, these features were investigated and correlated to define accurate descriptors of the produced functional drinks. The results showed that combined drinks and multi-strain fermentation generated higher-value products. For example, combined drinks in comparison with single ones had a lower amount of toxic 2-acetyl-3,5-dimethylfuran and higher abundances of desirable compounds such as 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy and butanoic acid. Multivariate analysis of volatile metabolites and physiological parameters could offer a novel approach to assess the quality of functional plant-based drinks and result in a decisional tool for industrial applications.",Food & function,"['D001628', 'D005285', 'D005516', 'D006801', 'D041941', 'D012275', 'D019936', 'D013025', 'D055549']","['Beverages', 'Fermentation', 'Food Microbiology', 'Humans', 'Milk Substitutes', 'Oryza', 'Probiotics', 'Soybeans', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Volatilome changes during probiotic fermentation of combined soy and rice drinks.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729245,2021
32052448,"Red oncom, a fermented product from solid waste of soybean curd process, and black oncom, a similar fermented product but made from defatted peanut cake, have been known to have umami taste. Umami fractions of red oncom and black oncom that are responsible for umami taste have not been investigated yet. The objective of this research was to characterize umami fractions obtained by ultrafiltration and chromatography of both oncoms. The first step, water-soluble extracts of oncoms were ultrafiltered using a membrane with cutoff 3,000 Da and followed by gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G-25) to obtain umami fractions. Ultrafiltration fractions of red oncom (molecular weight [MW] less than 3,000 Da) and black oncom (MW more than 3,000 Da) had an intense umami taste. The further fractionation by gel filtration chromatography linked to taste dilution analysis yielded umami fractions. Chemical characterization revealed that free glutamic acid, free phenylalanine, and peptides containing their residual amino acids were present in the fractions.

31940983,"Food plants contain hundreds of bioactive phytochemicals arising from different secondary metabolic pathways. Among these, the metabolic route of the amino acid Tryptophan yields a large number of plant natural products with chemically and pharmacologically diverse properties. We propose the identifier ""indolome"" to collect all metabolites in the Tryptophan pathway. In addition, Tryptophan-rich plant sources can be used as substrates for the fermentation by yeast strains to produce pharmacologically active metabolites, such as Melatonin. To pursue this technological development, we have developed a UHPLC-MS/MS method to monitor 14 Tryptophan, Tryptamine, amino-benzoic, and pyridine metabolites. In addition, different extraction procedures to improve the recovery of Tryptophan and its derivatives from the vegetal matrix were tested. We investigated soybeans, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and spirulina because of their botanical diversity and documented healthy effects. Four different extractions with different solvents and temperatures were tested, and water extraction at room temperature was chosen as the most suitable procedure to extract the whole Tryptophan metabolites pattern (called by us ""indolome"") in terms of ease, high efficiency, short time, low cost, and sustainability. In all plant matrices, Tryptophan was the most abundant indole compound, while the pattern of its metabolites was different in the diverse plants extracts. Overall, 5-OH Tryptamine and Kynurenine were the most abundant compounds, despite being 100-1000-fold lower than Tryptophan. Melatonin was undetected in all extracts, but sesame showed the presence of a Melatonin isomer. The results of this study highlight the variability in the occurrence of indole compounds among diverse food plants. The knowledge of Tryptophan metabolism in plants represents a relevant issue for human health and nutrition.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D002853', 'D028464', 'D005504', 'D013058', 'D012639', 'D031685', 'D013025', 'D014364']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cucurbita', 'Food Analysis', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Seeds', 'Sesamum', 'Soybeans', 'Tryptophan']",LC-MS/MS-Based Profiling of Tryptophan-Related Metabolites in Healthy Plant Foods.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31940983,2020

30442926,"Phytoestrogens are plant-derived compounds found in a variety of foods, most notably, soy. These compounds have been shown to improve immuno-metabolic health, yet mechanisms remain uncertain. We demonstrated previously that dietary phytoestrogen-rich soy (SOY) rescued metabolic dysfunction/inflammation following ovariectomy (OVX) in female rats; we also noted remarkable shifts in gut microbiota in SOY vs control diet-fed rats. Importantly, specific bacteria that significantly increased in those fed the SOY correlated positively with several favorable host metabolic parameters. One mechanism by which gut microbes might lead to such host effects is through production of bacterial metabolites. To test this possibility, we utilized non-targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) to assess the fecal metabolome in those previously studied animals. Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) revealed clear separation of fecal metabolomes based on diet and ovarian state. In particular, SOY-fed animals had greater fecal concentrations of the beneficial bacterial metabolite, S-equol, which was positively associated with several of the bacteria upregulated in the SOY group.

In addition, the potential allergenicity of FSBM was assessed by conducting in vitro competitive inhibition ELISA and oral sensitization and challenge of a BALB/c mice model. The results indicated that the total amino acid content increased and soy protein was degraded into polypeptides with low molecular weights that were derived from the hydrolysis of the allergen sequences N232-D383, G253-I265, E169-S215, G68-G98, A365-I375, and V153-A167. Moreover, the FSBM group exhibited a lower in vitro immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding capacity than the SBM group. The BALB/c model indicated that the FSBM group manifested milder damage to the intestine, lower mMCP-1 and IgE levels, and higher IFN-γ levels as compared to the SBM group.

This study evaluated the water extract of soybean meal, a low-cost compound system, in mediating the laccase catalyzed degradation of a model contaminant of emerging concern, sulfadimethoxine (SDM), and demonstrated it as a promising alternative mediator for soil and water remediation. Removal of 73.3% and 65.6% was achieved in 9 h using soybean meal extract (SBE) as the mediating system for laccase-catalyzed degradation of sulfadimethoxine at the concentration of 1 ppm and 10 ppm, respectively.

28294226,"Soy is an important component of the human diet thanks to its nutritional value and high protein content; however, it also represents a risk for allergenic consumers due to its potential to trigger adverse reactions in sensitized individuals. The putative correlation between immunoreactivity and resistance to the human gastrointestinal (GI) digestion has drawn attention to investigating soybean proteins digestibility. In this work, we provided further insights into this field by performing in vitro simulated GI digestion experiments directly on ground soybean seeds, to provide more realistic results obtained from the digestion of the whole food matrix. Soybean digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by untargeted HPLC-MS/MS analysis and the final data were software treated to enable protein/peptide identification. The latter allowed monitoring the proteolytic degradation of the main soybean proteins during the gastric and duodenal phases. In particular, β-conglycinin and trypsin inhibitors showed the highest resistance to the combined activity of GI enzymes, showing a partial degradation at the end of the duodenal phase as ascertained by the strong electrophoretic bands displayed at 50 kDa and 20 kDa, respectively. Glycinin subunits also presented, even if to a lower extent, resistance to the complete proteolytic degradation, as demonstrated by polypeptide fragments with molecular weight lower than 20 kDa displayed in the gel at the end of duodenal digestion. In addition, by bioinformatics analysis it was demonstrated that the GI resistant fragments of the allergenic proteins, β-conglycinin and glycinin, retained in their primary structure linear epitopes potentially able to trigger an immunoreaction when exposed to the intestinal mucosa. Moreover, such resistant peptides also presented a structural homology with epitope sequences recognized in other legume species, presenting a potential risk of adverse cross-reaction for a larger category of allergic consumers.",Food & function,"['D000595', 'D004386', 'D005753', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D008969', 'D010449', 'D030262', 'D013025', 'D053719']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Duodenum', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Soybean Proteins', 'Soybeans', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Insight into the gastro-duodenal digestion resistance of soybean proteins and potential implications for residual immunogenicity.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28294226,2017

Despite strong evidence supporting its beneficial use in agriculture, there are concerns that chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, could present a risk to terrestrial ecosystems and human health. Triclosan is one of the most commonly detected compounds in biosolids. To date, laboratory studies indicate that triclosan likely poses a de minimis risk to field crops; however, these studies were either conducted under unrealistic exposure conditions or only assessed 1 or 2 formulations of biosolids. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of triclosan on field crops in soils amended with 4 different formulations of biosolids (liquid, dewatered, compost, and alkaline-hydrolyzed), containing both background and spiked triclosan concentrations, following best management practices used in the province of Ontario. Three crop species (corn, soybean, and spring wheat) were evaluated using several plant growth endpoints (e.g., root wet mass, shoot length, shoot wet/dry mass) in 70-d to 90-d potted soil tests. The results indicated no adverse impact of triclosan on any crop-biosolids combination. Conversely, amending soil with biosolids either enhanced or had no negative effect, on the growth of plants.

27626287,"Dietary isoflavones, daidzein and genistein are of huge interest in the nutraceutical field due to their practical application to postmenopause complications. This study is the first report an efficient method to prepare isoflavone rich soybean leaves (soyleaves) which is an edible food stuff in Asian countries. The preharvest treatment of ethylene highly stimulated the level of isoflavone in soyleaves. Annotation and quantification of metabolites were determined by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS and HPLC. Phenolic metabolites of soyleaves are mostly kaempferol glycosides, but not dietary isoflavones. The accumulated isoflavones by ethylene treatment were determined to be daidzin 1, genistin 2, malonyldaidzin 3 and malonylgenistin 4, which were easily hydrolyzed to daidzein and genistein by β-glucosidase. Total content of dietary isoflavones was increased up to 13854 μg/g. The most suitable condition was estimated to be 250 μg/g ethylene or 200 μg/g ethephon (ethylene donor) treatment at the R3 growth stage. The ratio of daidzein and genistein glycosides was approximately 5 to 3. The accumulated isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes were identified within the transcriptome of soyleaves tissues at 1 day after treatment of ethephon. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis of these genes indicated significantly higher expression of CHS, CHI, IFS, HID, IF7GT, and IF7MaT compared to control leaves. These findings suggest that ethylene activates a set of structural genes involved in isoflavonoid biosynthesis, thereby leading to enhanced production of isoflavones in soybean plants.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002851', 'D018076', 'D005030', 'D019833', 'D005960', 'D006027', 'D007529', 'D018515', 'D018749', 'D013025', 'D053719', 'D001617']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Ethylenes', 'Genistein', 'Glucosides', 'Glycosides', 'Isoflavones', 'Plant Leaves', 'RNA, Plant', 'Soybeans', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'beta-Glucosidase']",Ethylene Induced a High Accumulation of Dietary Isoflavones and Expression of Isoflavonoid Biosynthetic Genes in Soybean (Glycine max) Leaves.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000096', 'Q000737', 'Q000302', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'biosynthesis', 'chemistry', 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27626287,2017

However, the biological activities of okara ingredients have not yet been fully understood, and the effectiveness of okara as a functional food seems necessary to be further evaluated. Then the effect of okara extract on angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was examined in vitro, and the extract was shown to cause the inhibition of ACE activity in a manner depending on its concentration. Kinetic analysis indicated that this enzyme inhibition was accompanied by an increase in the Km value without any change in Vmax. Further studies suggested that putative inhibitory substances contained in the extract might be heat stable and dialyzable, and recovered mostly in the peptide fraction obtained by a spin-column separation and a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation. Therefore, the extract was speculated to contain small-size peptides responsible for the inhibitory effect of okara extract on ACE activity, and could be expected to improve the hypertensive conditions by reducing the production of hypertensive peptide.",Journal of dietary supplements,"['D000704', 'D000804', 'D000806', 'D000959', 'D005591', 'D002851', 'D006801', 'D006973', 'D010455', 'D010936', 'D030262', 'D013025']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Angiotensin II', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Peptides', 'Plant Extracts', 'Soybean Proteins', 'Soybeans']",Soy Pulp Extract Inhibits Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Activity In Vitro: Evidence for Its Potential Hypertension-Improving Action.,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000188', 'Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000737']","[None, 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'methods', None, None, 'drug therapy', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27558170,2017

A cDNA library was constructed from seven stages of developing soybean seeds to investigate candidate allergens. We searched the library for cDNAs encoding a seed-specific biotinylated protein (SBP) based on its allergenicity in boiled lentils. A full-length cDNA clone was retrieved and expressed as a 75.6-kDa His-tagged recombinant protein (rSBP) in Escherichia coli. Western immunoblotting of boiled bacterial extracts demonstrated specific IgE binding to rSBP, which was further purified by metal affinity and anion exchange chromatographies. Of the 23 allergic sera screened by ELISA, 12 contained IgEs specific to the purified rSBP. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a predominantly unordered structure consistent with SBP's heat stability. The natural homologues (nSBP) were the main proteins isolated from soybean and peanut embryos after streptavidin affinity purification, yet they remained low-abundance proteins in the seed as confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Using capture ELISAs, the soybean and peanut nSBPs were bound by IgEs in 78 and 87% of the allergic sera tested. The soybean nSBP was purified to homogeneity and treatments with different denaturing agents before immunoblotting highlighted the diversity of its IgE epitopes. In vitro activation of basophils was assessed by flow cytometry in a cohort of peanut-allergic children sensitized to soybean. Stronger and more frequent (38%) activations were induced by nSBP-soy compared to the major soybean allergen, Gly m 5.

Additionally, the antiobesity effects of CLM and fermented-CLM (FCLM) were studied based on the analysis of plasma from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The levels of cyanidin and the glycosides of luteolin, quercetin, and cyanidin derived from L. caerulea were decreased, whereas the levels of luteolin and quercetin were increased during fermentation. Isoflavone glycosides and soyasaponins originating from the soybean were decreased, whereas their aglycones such as daidzein, glycitein, and genistein were increased. As for prenylated flavonoids from C. tricuspidata, these metabolites were decreased at the early stage of fermentation, and were increased at end of the fermentation. In terms of the functional food product, various metabolites derived from diverse natural products in CLM had complementary effects and demonstrated higher antioxidant and pancreatic lipase inhibition activities after fermentation; these activities were closely related to flavonoid aglycones including genistein, daidzein, glycitein, luteolin, and quercetin. In an in vivo experiment, several clinical parameters affected by HFD were improved by the administration of either CLM or FCLM, but there was a difference in the antiobesity effects. The levels of lysoPCs with C20:4, C16:0, and C22:6 were significantly attenuated by CLM administration, while the attenuated levels of lysoPCs with C20:4 and C18:2 were significantly restored by FCLM administration. These metabolites may explain the above-mentioned differences in antiobesity effects. Although only the changes in plasma lysophospholipids could not fully explain antiobesity effects between non-fermented and fermented plant mixtures from our results, we suggest that metabolomics approach could provide a way to reveal the metabolite alterations in the complex fermentation process and understand the differences or changes in bioactivity according to fermentation.

Results showed numerous proteins exhibiting wide ranges of isoelectric points and relative molecular masses. When IgE immunoreactivities of 18 food allergy patients were individually tested in 1 and 2D western-blots, a very diversified IgE repertoire was observed, reflecting extensive cross-reactivities but also co-sensitizations. Besides already well known and characterized allergens, mass spectrometry analysis allowed the identification of 22 allergens undescribed until now: 10 in peanut, 2 in soybean, 3 in sesame and 7 in lentil. Three allergens are legume storage proteins and the others belong to transport proteins, nucleotide binding proteins and proteins involved in the regulation of metabolism. Seven proteins are potentially similar to allergens described in plants and fungi and 11 are not related to any known allergen.

The candidate certified reference material, NMIJ CRM 7509-a, that was prepared from the raw soybeans containing target pesticides (diazinon, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos, and permethrin) was used as the test sample. Forty participants submitted two sets of analytical results along with the details of the analytical method and conditions they applied. Two types of assigned values were established for each target pesticide: one was derived from the analytical results of the participants, and the other was provided from the analytical results by isotope-dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS). The latter values were 7.4-16% higher than the former values, plausibly because the analytical values from the IDMS measurements were not affected by the recovery ratio of the target pesticides during the analytical process. Thus, two kinds of z-scores were calculated for individual participants using the corresponding assigned values: one (z1-score) showed the relative performance score for the present PT and the other (z2-score) could be used for evaluation of the trueness of their analytical methods.

25463210,"In most cases of mycotoxin detection, quantitation is critical while immunochromatographic strip tests are qualitative in nature. Moreover, the sensitivity of this technique is questioned. In order to overcome these limitations, an ultrasensitive and quantitative immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for rapid and sensitive quantitation of ochratoxin A (OTA) was developed. The assay was based on a competitive format and its sensitivity was improved by using a sensitive and selective OTA monoclonal antibody (OTA-mAb). The visible ICA results were obtained within 15 min, and in addition to visual examination, they were read by the rapid color intensity portable strip reader. The visual and computational detection limits (vLOD and cLOD, respectively) for ochratoxin A were 0.2 and 0.25 ng mL(-1), respectively. These values were lower than those reported by previous studies in a range 5-2500 folds. For validation, contaminated samples including wheat, maize, rice and soybean were assayed by ICA and a standard high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results were in good agreement for both ICA and HPLC methods. The average recoveries of the HPLC were in the range 72-120% while the ICA values were from 76 to 104%, confirming the accuracy and sensitivity of this method.","Journal of chromatography.

There is a need to deplete the vicilins from maize embryo extracts for enhanced proteomics analysis. We here reported a chloroform-assisted phenol extraction (CAPE) method for vicilin depletion. By CAPE, maize embryo proteins were first extracted in an aqueous buffer, denatured by chloroform and then subjected to phenol extraction. We found that CAPE can effectively deplete the vicilins from maize embryo extract, allowing the detection of low-abundance proteins that were masked by vicilins in 2-DE gel. The novelty of CAPE is that it selectively depletes abundant storage proteins from embryo extracts of both monocot (maize) and dicot (soybean and pea) seeds, whereas other embryo proteins were not depleted. CAPE can significantly improve proteome profiling of embryos and extends the application of chloroform and phenol extraction in plant proteomics.

Individuals of the three species were provided with a preweighed dry soybean seed and allowed to feed for 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 d, after which the remaining seed was analyzed for any change in weight, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate concentration. Lipids, carbohydrates, and seed weights were reduced by bug feeding, and the reduction was directly proportional to feeding duration. H. halys was found to be the most voracious feeder, reducing soybean seed weight by 42% after 24 d of feeding. There was a significant interaction between species and feeding duration for changes in nutritional components. Seeds fed on by H. halys had the highest incremental increase in protein content (13%) after 24 d of feeding, followed by those fed on by R. pedestris and P. hybneri. However, carbohydrates and lipid content of the soybean seeds fed by the tested insect species were found to decrease significantly.

Therefore, accumulation of the α' subunit of β-conglycinin in rice seeds could lead to the production of new functional rice that could promote human health.

Oral administration of the transgenic rice containing the α' subunit exhibited a hypocholesterolemic activity in rats; the serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were significantly reduced when compared to those of the control rice (var. a123). The cholesterol-lowering action by transgenic rice accumulating the α' subunit induces a significant increase in fecal bile acid excretion and a tendency to increase in fecal cholesterol excretion.

25743385,"A validation study was performed on a multiresidue method for determination of pesticide residues in agricultural products according to the method validation guideline of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. FASRAC (Food Automatic Analytical Systems for Residual Agricultural Chemicals) automatically performs extraction of pesticide residues from agricultural products with acetonitrile, filtration, constant volume, mixing with the use of air, mixing acetonitrile with buffer solvent, separation, and dehydration with sodium sulfate. The extract was purified with a GC/NH2 column. For wheat flour and soybeans, a purification step with a C18 column was added before a GC/NH2 column. After removal of the solvent, the extract was resolved in n-hexane/acetone solvent for GC-MS/MS analysis. In the case of manual analysis, pesticide residues were analyzed according to official multiresidue methods and purification steps were the same as in FASRAC. Recovery tests were performed with wheat flour, soybeans, spinach and apples, by addition of 302 pesticides at the concentrations 0.01 mg/kg. The results indicate that automatic extraction using FASRAC is superior to manual analysis in trueness, repeatability and within-run reproducibility. Specially, automatic extraction using FASRAC is superior to manual analysis in trueness because it is optimized in various respects, for example reextraction at salting-out.",Shokuhin eiseigaku zasshi.

Mycotoxin analysis of aflatoxins (AFs), zearalenone (ZEA), fumonisins (FBs) and ochratoxin A (OTA) was done by HPLC-FLD (high performance liquid chromatography with postcolumn fluorescence derivatization), alternariol and alternariol monomethyl ether with HPLC-UV (HPLC with UV detection), trichothecenes (deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, fusarenon X, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol were analyzed by GC-ECD (gas chromatography with electron capture detector). Fungal colonization was more frequently found for samples from América, Saladillo and Trenque Lauquen than for samples from General Villegas and Trenel; a total of 1,401 fungal isolates were obtained from the soybean seeds. The most commonly identified fungal genera were Alternaria, Sclerotinia, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Phomopsis and Fusarium. Alternaria alternata, A.tenuissima, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium citrinum, Fusarium verticillioides and F.semitectum were the predominant toxigenic fungal species.

The aim of this study was to separate and purify and to identify antifungal compounds of bacterium associated with novel entomopathogenic nematode and check the antifungal property of identified compound in particular food model systems. The antifungal compound was purified using silica gel column chromatography, TLC and HPLC and its structure was elucidated using NMR (¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, ¹H-¹H COSY, ¹H-¹³C HMBC), HRMS and Marfey's method. Based on the spectral data, the active compounds were identified as diketopiperazine [cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu)]. The antifungal activity of cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) was studied by MIC and paper disk assay against Aspergillus flavus MTCC 277 and Aspergillus niger MTCC 282 and best MIC value of 8μg/ml was recorded against A. flavus. Cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) strongly inhibit mycelia growth of fungus and thereby affecting aflatoxin production. To investigate the potential application of the cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) and to eliminate fungal spoilage in food and feed, soybean and peanut were used as models. White mycelia and dark/pale green spores of A. flavus were observed in the control soybeans after 2-day incubation. However the fungal growth was not observed in soybeans treated with cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu). Almost the same result was observed for peanuts treated with cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) for A. niger. The cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) was nontoxic to two normal human cell lines (FS normal fibroblast and L231 lung epithelial) up to 200μg/ml.

23281487,"At the present, no secreted phospholipase A₂ (sPLA₂) from soybean (Glycine max) was investigated in detail. In this work we identified five sequences of putative secreted sPLA₂ from soybean after a BLAST search in G. max database. Sequence analysis showed a conserved PA2c domain bearing the Ca²⁺ binding loop and the active site motif. All the five mature proteins contain 12 cysteine residues, which are commonly conserved in plant sPLA₂s. We propose a phylogenetic tree based on sequence alignment of reported plant sPLA₂s including the novel enzymes from G. max. According to PLA₂ superfamily, two of G. max sPLA₂s are grouped as XIA and the rest of sequences as XIB, on the basis of differences found in their molecular weights and deviating sequences especially in the N- and C-terminal regions of the isoenzymes. Furthermore, we report the cloning, expression and purification of one of the putative isoenzyme denoted as GmsPLA₂-XIA-1. We demonstrate that this mature sPLA₂ of 114 residues had PLA₂ activity on Triton:phospholipid mixed micelles and determine the kinetic parameters for this system. We generate a model based on the known crystal structure of sPLA₂ from rice (isoform II), giving first insights into the three-dimensional structure of folded GmsPLA₂-XIA-1. Besides describing the spatial arrangement of highly conserved pair HIS-49/ASP-50 and the Ca⁺² loop domains, we propose the putative amino acids involved in the interfacial recognition surface.

22830612,"Fusarium equiseti and Fusarium semitectum represent the most abundant species in the Fusarium complex isolated from flowers, soybean pods and seeds in Argentina. The aim of the present study was to assess the production of major type A and type B trichothecenes (diacetoxyscirpenol, neosolaniol, T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin, nivalenol, deoxynivalenol) and zearalenone by 40 F. equiseti and 22 F. semitectum isolates on rice culture. Mycotoxins were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection after derivatisation with 1-anthronylnitrile for type A trichothecenes (i.e. diacetoxyscirpenol, neosolaniol, T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin), by HPLC with UV detection for type B trichothecenes (i.e. nivalenol and deoxynivalenol), and by TLC for zearalenone. A total of 22 of 40 F. equiseti isolates produced diacetoxyscirpenol, nivalenol and ZEA alone or in combination, whereas only two of 20 F. semitectum isolates were nivalenol and ZEA producers. Both Fusarium species did not produce any deoxynivalenol, neosolaniol, T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin. The variable retention in toxigenicity displayed by both fungal species suggests that these species have a saprophytic lifestyle in the soybean agroecosystem in Argentina.","Food additives & contaminants.

The P34 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) as an inclusion body under the induction of 0.8 mmol/L isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After purification with His-Bind affinity chromatography, the purity quotient of the recombinant protein was over 92 %, and its molecular weight (approximately 33 kDa) was very close to that of the native soybean P34. The polyclonal antibody (pAB) against P34 was prepared with the purified recombinant P34. The generated pAB, named as pAB-P34, exhibited high specificity to the P34 protein of the soybean meal. The indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) based on pAB-P34 was established to determine the P34 content of soybean products. The CVs of the recovery tests of P34 were less than 7.77 %, which indicated that iELISA had high reproducibility and accuracy.

All VLYB showed high values of apparent viscosity and water holding capacity. During fermentation, lactic acid bacteria consumed glucose, fructose, and malic acid, which was supplied with grape must. Compared to control vegetable yogurt-like beverages (CVYLB), without bacterial inoculum, an increase of total free amino acids (FAA) was found during fermentation and storage. Also the concentration of polyphenolic compounds and ascorbic acid (ASC) was higher in VLYB compared to CVYLB. This was reflected on the antioxidant activity.

Two syringe-driven chelating columns (SDCCs), Nobias Chelate PB-1M and InertSep ME-1, were investigated in the present experiment. The results of the pH dependence of Mo removal rates showed that separation of Cd and Mo could be obtained at pH conditions over 7.

Furthermore, it was found that InertSep ME-1 was more effective for separating Cd from the interfering elements, with removal rates approximately 100% for Mo, Zr, and Sn while the recovery of Cd was approximately 100%. The optimized SPE operations were as follows: 0.6 mL of NH(4)OH was added into each 10 mL of digested sample solution; the sample solution was loaded into each pre-cleaned SDCCs at a flow rate of 5 mL min(-1); after 5 mL of ultrapure water was passed through the SDCC for washing, 2 mL of 0.3M HNO(3) was passed through to elute Cd and the eluent was subjected to ICP-MS measurement.

A fractionation procedure was set up to create multiple fractions of the feed, which were subsequently analysed by NMR and UPLC-TOF/MS operating in positive mode. Comparison of the profiles revealed that the most apparent differences came from the isoflavones in the soy as well as a compound with a molecular mass of 441.202 (M + 1)⁺, which was identified as N,N'-diferuloylputrescine (DFP) and came from the corn. Whether the observed differences in effects are due to the higher levels of isoflavones and DFP is unclear, as is the fact whether the observed differences are typical for organic or conventional produced corn and soy. However, this study shows that this metabolomics approach is suitable for detecting potential differences between products, even in levels of compounds that would have been overlooked with a more targeted approach.

20625716,"Lunasin, a cancer-preventive peptide, was isolated from soybean, barley, and wheat. Previous studies showed that this 43-amino acid peptide has the ability to suppress chemical carcinogen-induced transformation in mammalian cells and skin carcinogenesis in mice. In this study, we attempted to use the Escherichia coli T7 expression system for expression of lunasin. The lunasin gene was synthesized by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with the use of vector pET29a. The recombinant lunasin containing his-tag at the C-terminus was expressed in soluble form which could be purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. After 4 h, the expression level is above 4.73 mg of recombinant his-tagged lunasin/L of Luria-Bertani broth. It does not affect the bacterial growth and expression levels. This is the first study that successfully uses E. coli as a host to produce valuable bioactive lunasin. The result of in vitro bioassay showed that the purified recombinant lunasin can inhibit histone acetylation. Recombinant lunasin also inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and nitric oxide production).

In the present study, analysis of 148 soybean genotypes for sucrose and total raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) contents revealed a higher variation (4.80-fold) for sucrose than for RFOs content (2.63-fold). High-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed ranges of 0.64-2.53 and 2.09-7.1 mmol/100 g for raffinose and stachyose contents, respectively. As information concerning the environmental effects on the sucrose and RFOs content in soybean seeds is not available, we also investigated a set of seven genotypes raised at widely different geographical locations for these quality traits. Sucrose content was found to be significantly higher at cooler location (Palampur); however, differences observed for raffinose and stachyose contents across the growing locations were genotype-dependent.

18192686,"The tissue concentrations of the female sex hormone 17beta-estradiol (E2) and its reactive catechol metabolites such as 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-HO-E2) play important roles in hormonal carcinogenesis. They are influenced by the activity of local enzymes involved in the metabolic activation and inactivation of E2. In the mammary gland, catechol estrogens are predominately inactivated by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Food supplements containing the soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein are consumed because they are believed to protect from breast cancer; however, this proposed benefit is controversial. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of soy isoflavones on the gene expression and activity of COMT in cultured human mammary adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells. Levels of COMT messenger RNA (mRNA) were determined by reverse transcription/competitive polymerase chain reaction and COMT activity was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the methylation products of both the model substrate quercetin and the physiological relevant substrate 4-HO-E2. Our study demonstrates for the first time that soy isoflavones at hormonally active concentrations cause a significant reduction of both COMT mRNA levels and COMT activity as well as of the methylation of 4-HO-E2. Experiments using the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780 support a role of the ER in the isoflavone-induced down-regulation of COMT expression. Thus, this study not only demonstrates that hormonally active concentrations of soy isoflavones inhibit the detoxification of catechols in this human breast cancer cell line but also implies that diet might influence COMT activity to a greater extent than heretofore recognized.",Carcinogenesis,"['D001943', 'D002394', 'D045744', 'D049109', 'D004032', 'D004958', 'D002393', 'D005260', 'D000077267', 'D015972', 'D006801', 'D008954', 'D008956', 'D011960', 'D013025']","['Breast Neoplasms', 'Catechol O-Methyltransferase', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Diet', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens, Catechol', 'Female', 'Fulvestrant', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Chemical', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Soybeans']",Soy isoflavones decrease the catechol-O-methyltransferase-mediated inactivation of 4-hydroxyestradiol in cultured MCF-7 cells.,"['Q000188', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000031', 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","['drug therapy', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18192686,2008

To evaluate the potential health risk of AFB1 to Koreans posed by food consumption, we determined the natural occurrence of AFB1 in food and estimated the excess risk for liver cancer through dietary exposure to AFB1. A total of 694 food samples collected from six different regions of South Korea were analyzed for their AFB, content. One hundred four of the 694 samples were found to give positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) readings for AFB1 and were further investigated with high-performance liquid chromatography. Thirty-two samples, including 2 maize samples, 3 soybean products, 20 peanut samples, nut samples, and their products, and 7 spices, were found to be contaminated with AFB1 (4.6% incidence), up to 48.6 microg kg(-1). The level of AFB1 contamination in 28 of the 32 food products was below 10 microg kg(-1), which is the legal tolerance limit in Korea. From data on daily food consumption, the exposure dose of AFB1 was estimated to be 6.42 x 10(-7) mg kg(-1) body weight (bw) day(-1). The major contributors to the dietary intake of AFB1 were soybean paste and soy sauce, which composed 91% of the total exposure to AFB1. The excess risk of liver cancer for those exposed to AFB1 through food intake was estimated to be 5.78 x 10(-6) for hepatitis B-negative individuals and 1.48 x 10(-4) for hepatitis B-positive individuals.

Flour dough containing soy flour at 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% was fried in corn oil at 180 degrees C for 2.5 min, and a total of 60 fryings were performed every 30 min. The oxidation of oil was determined by contents of free fatty acids (FFA), conjugated dienoic acids (CDA), polar compounds, and p-anisidine values (PAV). Tocopherols and phospholipids (PLs) in the oil were determined by HPLC. Tocopherols were present in corn oil at 1000 ppm before frying and increased after the first frying of dough containing soy flour due to tocopherol transfer from soy-flour-added dough to the oil during frying. However, as the oil repeated frying, tocopherol contents decreased and its degradation rate was higher in the oil that fried soy-flour-added dough than in the oil that fried the dough without soy flour. PL was not detected in corn oil before and after frying. As the oil repeated frying, FFA, CDA, and polar compounds contents, and PAV of frying oil increased due to the oil oxidation. The values were higher in the oil which fried soy-flour-added dough than in the oil fried the dough without soy flour, indicating the acceleration of oil oxidation by soy flour added to dough.

17678570,"Soya isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, are the focus of numerous studies investigating their potential effects on health and results remain controversial. Bioavailability is clearly a crucial factor influencing their bioefficacy and could explain these discrepancies. This study aimed at assessing: (1) the isoflavone content of sixty-nine European soya-derivative products sold on the French market; (2) the bioavailability of isoflavones comparing supplement with food. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited in a randomized two-way crossover trial and received 35 mg isoflavones equivalent aglycone either through supplements or through cheese, both containing different patterns of isoflavone conjugates and different daidzein:genistein ratios. A specific ELISA method was used to assess the plasma and urinary concentrations of isoflavones and thus the pharmacokinetic parameters, which were then normalized to mg of each isoflavone ingested. Results showed that the normalized Cmax of daidzein (P = 0.002) and similarly the normalized AUC0 --> infinity and Cmax of genistein (P = 0.002) from soya-based capsules were higher than that from soya-based cheese. In conclusion, this work completes studies on isoflavone bioavailability and presents new data regarding isoflavone concentrations in soya-derivative products. Assuming that isoflavone conjugation patterns do not influence isoflavone bioavailability, this study shows that isoflavones contained in capsules are more bioavailable than those contained in soya-based cheese.

16684499,"Soybeans are a rich source of protein and a key feed ingredient in livestock production, but lack sufficient levels of cysteine and methionine to meet the nutritional demands of swine or poultry as feed components. Although engineering the sulfur assimilatory pathway could lead to increased sulfur-containing amino acid content, little is known about this pathway in legumes. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of soybean ATP sulfurylase (ATPS), which acts as the metabolic entry point into the sulfur assimilation pathway. Analysis of the ATPS clone isolated from a soybean seedling cDNA library revealed an open-reading frame, encoding a 52 kDa polypeptide with an N-terminal chloroplast/plastid transit peptide, which was related to the enzymes from Arabidopsis, potato, human, and yeast. Soybean ATP sulfurylase was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. Based on gel-filtration chromatography, the enzyme functions as a 100 kDa homodimer. Analysis of genomic DNA by Southern blotting revealed that multiple genes encode ATP sulfurylase in soybean. Analysis of the transcript profiles retrieved from a soybean EST database indicated that ATP sulfurylase mRNA was most abundant in root tissue. Cold treatment induced mRNA accumulation and enhanced the specific activity of ATP sulfurylase in root tissue.

16245725,"A strategy for rapid in situ elimination of interfering substances that are present in extracts of food samples during assay is described in this article. The novel feature of this method is that the sample purification is carried out as a part of the assay, and a separate sample cleanup step is not required. The assay procedure involves the sequential addition of standard or sample, cleaning solutions, and aflatoxin B1-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (AFB1-HRP) over antibody-spotted zones of a membrane, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate for visualization. We have determined that trifluoroacetic acid and propionic acids at concentrations of 100 mM are highly effective for cleaning groundnut, wheat, corn, and poultry feed samples and that NaHCO3 (100 mM) is successful in cleaning processed soybean. In all cases, subsequent washing was performed with phosphate-buffered saline solution to facilitate the removal of traces of adhering interfering substances. A batch of 12 samples can be analyzed within 8 min either by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards or, more precisely, by densitometry. The method was tested for the analysis of AFB1 in groundnut, wheat, corn, processed soybean, chili, and poultry feed. The detection limit obtained was 5 microg/kg, except for chili, where it was 10 microg/kg. The average recoveries from different noninfected food samples spiked with AFB1 at concentrations of 5 to 100 microg/kg were between 99 and 105%. The values obtained for infected corn and groundnut samples correlated well with the estimates obtained by high-pressure liquid chromatography.

Dietary RDP was gradually decreased by replacing solvent soybean meal and urea with lignosulfonate-treated soybean meal. The purine metabolites xanthine and hypoxanthine were present in digesta and microbial samples and were assumed to be of microbial origin. The sum of the purines and their metabolites (adenine, guanine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine) were defined as total purines (TP) and used as a microbial marker. Decreasing dietary RDP from 13.2 to 10.6% of dry matter (DM) reduced microbial nonammonia N (NAN) flows estimated using TP (from 415 to 369 g/d), 15N (from 470 to 384 g/d), AA profiles (from 392 to 311 g/d), and PD (from 436 to 271 g/d). Averaged across diets, microbial NAN flows were highest when estimated using TP and 15N (398 and 429 g/d), lowest when using PD (305 g/d), and intermediate when using AA profiles (360 g/d) as microbial markers.

The fluorescent properties of NFX were examined both free in solution and in MLV, using anisotropy and fluorescence quenching measurements. The latter data was treated with a chemometric method to deconvolute the overlapped spectra of zwitterionic and neutral species of NFX in equilibrium at this pH.

15913016,"A major, often unrecognized variable regulating plant growth in semi-closed environment is air contaminant. The vapor of propylene glycol (PG), which was used as coolant in growth chambers, has been found to be toxic to corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) plants. PG solution leaked from a valve packing system and volatilized to vapor, which was trapped in a semi-closed growth chamber. Symptoms of leaf edge chlorosis, later developing into necrosis, were observed on the third day of emergence or on the third day after moving healthy plants into the chamber. For young soybean plants, symptoms were slightly different from those observed in corn plants; the chlorosis symptoms were not uniformly distributed on all leaves. Some soybean leaves curled up and others had white spots. This problem was identified by using a portable photoionization detector to obtain instantaneous readings of total volatile organic compound concentrations inside the chambers. The presence of PG in selected chambers was verified using sample collection with solid phase microextraction (SPME) followed by analysis with multi-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry (MD-GC-MS).

The potential effects of genistein on the sensory and chemical quality of fish muscle may affect the full utilization of soybean meal as an alternative protein in aquaculture diets. Fingerling trout fed commercial diets containing 0, 500, 1000, or 3000 ppm pure genistein were analyzed after 6 and 12 months of feeding. Genistein was extracted by enzymatic digestions in Tris buffer and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Moisture, fat, protein, ash, and tristimulus color of the fillets were determined. The extent of lipid oxidation occurring in fillets harvested after 12 months of feeding was studied by measurements of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) after 4 and 8 days of refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C. Triangle tests were performed to determine if there were any detectable sensory differences. A dietary genistein content of 3000 ppm led to the deposition of approximately 5.4 pmol of genistein/mg of fillet. Triangle test panelists were unable to detect any significant (p < or = 0.05) differences between the fillets from trout fed the 0 and 3000 ppm genistein concentrations. Moisture, ash, and protein content were influenced by time of harvest, while color was unaffected.

No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, genistein and biochanin A.

Seeds were exposed to a nutrient solution containing 50 microM of one of two radiolabeled compounds, and plant organs were harvested separately after 18 days of growth. In wheat, uptake of [14C]-2,4-DCP was 16.67 +/- 2.65 and 15.50 +/- 2.60% of [14C]-2,4-DCA. In soybean, uptake of [14C]-2,4-DCP was significantly higher than [14C]-2,4-DCA uptake, 38.39 +/- 2.56 and 18.98 +/- 1.64%, respectively. In the case of [14C]-2,4-DCP, the radioactivity absorbed by both species was found mainly associated with roots, whereas [14C]-2,4-DCA and related metabolites were associated with aerial parts, especially in soybean. In wheat, nonextractable residues represented 7.8 and 8.7% of the applied radioactivity in the case of [14C]-2,4-DCP and [14C]-2,4-DCA, respectively. In soybean, nonextractable residues amounted to 11.8 and 5.8% of the total radioactivity for [14C]-2,4-DCP and [14C]-2,4-DCA, respectively. In wheat, nonextractable residues were nearly equivalent to extractable residues for [14C]-2,4-DCP, whereas they were greater for [14C]-2,4-DCA. In soybean, the amount of extractable residues was significantly greater for both chemicals. However, in both species, nonextractable residues were mainly associated with roots. Isolation of soluble residues was next undertaken using excised shoots (wheat) or excised fully expanded leaves including petioles (soybean).

Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables. The average nitrite contents in various vegetables were about 0.6 mg kg(-1), and the values were not significantly different among most vegetables.

Cows were fed total mixed rations containing (dry matter basis) 44% corn silage, 22% alfalfa silage, 2% urea, and 31% concentrate. The basal diet contained 31% high-moisture corn; equal N from one of four protein supplements was added to the other diets at the expense of corn: 9% solvent soybean meal (SSBM), 10% expeller soybean meal (ESBM), 5.5% blood meal (BM), and 7% corn gluten meal (CGM). Omasal sampling was used to quantify total AA N (TAAN) and nonammonia N (NAN) flows from the rumen. Estimates of RUP were made from differences between total and microbial N flows, including a correction for RUP in the basal diet. Modifying a spectrophotometric assay improved total purine recovery from isolated bacteria and omasal samples and gave estimates of microbial TAAN and NAN flows that were similar to a standard HPLC method. Linear programming, based on AA patterns of the diet and isolated omasal bacteria and ruminal protozoa, appeared to overestimate microbial TAAN and NAN flows compared to the purine assays. Yields of microbial TAAN and NAN determined using any method was not affected by diet and averaged 32 to 35 g NAN per kilogram of organic matter truly digested in the rumen.

The fragmentations by these anthocyanins of DNA to oligonucleosomal-sized fragments, that is a characteristic of apoptosis, were observed to be concentration-dependent. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an antioxidant, suppressed the fragmentation of DNA by these anthocyanins.

11836067,"Phytoestrogens, plant-derived nonsteroidal estrogens found in high abundance in most soy food products, have been studied for their potential beneficial effects against hormone-dependent cancers and age-related diseases. However, little is known about the influence of phytoestrogens on the brain or behavior. This brief review describes mainly our own studies in rodents that have examined the influence of dietary soy isoflavones on certain aspects of brain structure, learning, memory and anxiety along with the brain androgen-metabolizing enzyme, aromatase. These studies used a commercially available diet rich in phytoestrogens (Phyto-rich) vs. a custom diet relatively free of phytoestrogens (Phyto-free). The phytoestrogen content of each diet was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, circulating plasma phytoestrogen levels were quantified by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy and concentrations of phytoestrogens in specific brain regions were measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA). Our studies showed that brain aromatase levels were not significantly altered by phytoestrogen diet treatments in perinatal, maternal or adult rats. However, volumes of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) were significantly affected by the Phyto-free diet treatment in male rats during adulthood, where SDN-POA volumes were smaller compared to Phyto-rich male values. Additionally, the Phyto-rich diet fed to adult male and female rats produced anxiolytic effects as assessed in the elevated plus maze vs. Phyto-free fed animals. Finally, when learning and memory parameters were examined in a radial arm maze testing visual-spatial memory (VSM), the diet treatments significantly changed the typical sexually dimorphic pattern of VSM. Specifically, adult Phyto-rich fed females outperformed Phyto-free fed females, while in males on the same diets, the opposite pattern of maze performance was observed. When female vs. male performance was compared, Phyto-rich females executed the VSM task in a manner similar to that of Phyto-free fed males, while Phyto-free fed female's VSM was comparable to Phyto-rich males. These results indicate that consumption of dietary phytoestrogens resulting in very high plasma isoflavone levels (in many cases over a relatively short interval of consumption in adulthood) can significantly alter sexually dimorphic brain regions, anxiety, learning and memory. The findings of these studies identify the biological actions of phytoestrogens, specifically isoflavones and their metabolites, found in animal soy-containing diets on brain and behavior and implicate the importance of phytoestrogens given the recognized significance of estrogens in brain and neural disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, especially in women.",Neurotoxicology and teratology,"['D000818', 'D001522', 'D001921', 'D004968', 'D005260', 'D007529', 'D008297', 'D048789', 'D028321', 'D051381', 'D020318', 'D017207', 'D013025']","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain', 'Estrogens, Non-Steroidal', 'Female', 'Isoflavones', 'Male', 'Phytoestrogens', 'Plant Preparations', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Soybeans']",Neurobehavioral effects of dietary soy phytoestrogens.,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000494', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11836067,2002

The present study describes the short-term effects of dietary phytoestrogens on regulatory behaviors (food/water intake, locomotor activity and body weight), prostate weight, prostate 5alpha-reductase enzyme activity, reproductive hormone levels, and testicular steroidogenic acute regulatory peptide (StAR) levels in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were fed either a phytoestrogen-rich diet containing approximately 600 microg/g isoflavones (as determined by HPLC) or a phytoestrogen-free diet. After 5 weeks of consuming these diets, plasma phytoestrogen levels were 35 times higher in animals fed the phytoestrogen-rich vs phytoestrogen-free diets. Body and prostate weights were significantly decreased in animals fed the phytoestrogen-rich diet vs the phytoestrogen-free fed animals; however, no significant change in prostate 5alpha-reductase enzyme activity was observed between the treatment groups. Locomotor activity levels were higher in the phytoestrogen-rich vs the phytoestrogen-free animals during the course of the treatment interval. Plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels were significantly lower in the animals fed the phytoestrogen-rich diet compared with animals fed the phytoestrogen-free diet. However, there were no significant differences in plasma LH or estradiol levels between the diet groups. Testicular StAR levels were not significantly different between the phytoestrogen-rich vs the phytoestrogen-free fed animals. These results indicated that consumption of dietary phytoestrogens resulting in very high plasma isoflavone levels over a relatively short period can significantly alter body and prostate weight and plasma androgen hormone levels without affecting gonadotropin or testicular StAR levels.

We previously demonstrated that PCC, an ethanol extract of a commercial soybean processing by-product, repressed induced genomic DNA damage in mammalian cells. PCC was separated into a series of chemically defined fractions and two fractions (PCC70 and PCC100) repressed mutagen-induced damage.

In parallel, biomass estimation through plate counts in selective media for cellulolytic and saprotrophic fungi was also performed all throughout a soybean crop or middle growth cycle of wheat. As an enzymatic method, the fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolytic activity of the samples was determined. Owing to the high relationship exhibited by FDA hydrolysis with organic carbon and total nitrogen content of soil, the enzymatic activity was correlated with the microbial biomass estimated through marker lipids or plate counts.

In view of the importance of fermented foods in the Korean diet and the significant level of ethyl carbamate expected, we determined ethyl carbamate concentrations in some of the staple food items and estimated the daily intake for the Korean population. Ethyl carbamate in commercial samples of kimchi, soy sauce, vinegar, soybean paste, and alcoholic beverages were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/selective ion monitoring (GC-MS/SIM). Homemade soy sauce and kimchi were also analysed. The maximum ethyl carbamate concentrations observed were 73 micrograms/kg in soy sauce, 7.9 micrograms/kg in soybean paste, 2.5 micrograms/l in vinegar, 16.2 micrograms/kg in kimchi and 15.4 mu/l in Korean traditional alcoholic beverages. Combining these values with the average daily food intake data, we estimated that the maximum daily exposure of Korean population to ethyl carbamate is 2.8 micrograms/day, which is not a negligible amount considering the 'virtually safe dose' derived by animal experiment ranges between 1.2 and 4.8 micrograms/day.

10858697,"This paper reports the compilation of a food composition database for phylloquinone (vitamin K1) derived from the direct analysis of foods, recipe calculation and the assignment of values based on food similarities. All the basic and other food items used in these calculations had been analysed by HPLC and about 170 of the items had been obtained and assayed in the UK. Recipe calculations took account of the cooking method and changes in water and fat content. Currently, approximately 1501 food items with Royal Society of Chemistry/Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food food codes have been allocated a vitamin K1 value, and a further 282 new recipe codes are included in the database. Representative values from each food group are reported together with an indication of the potential variation. Detailed examples of some recipe calculations are included, and also the impact of changing the type of fat in recipes. Vitamin K1 is associated with, and most abundant in, photosynthetic tissues of plants. Accordingly, the highest concentrations (3000-6000 micrograms/kg) are found in dark-green leafy vegetables and herbs, such as kale, parsley, spinach and green cabbage. Intermediate concentrations (1000-2000 micrograms/kg) are found in plants with paler leaves such as white cabbage and lettuce or in green, non-leafy vegetables such as broccoli and brussel sprouts. Fats and oils contain variable amounts of vitamin K1 with the highest concentrations (300-1300 micrograms/kg) in soyabean, rapeseed and olive oils and the margarines based on them. Other foods such as dairy products, meat dishes and cereal-based foods (bread, biscuits, cakes, desserts etc.), although not in themselves particularly rich in vitamin K1 (< 200 micrograms/kg), may contribute significantly to intakes when consumption of green vegetables is poor.

The lipid backbones of mammalian GluCer (sphingosine, d18:1(delta4), and ceramide) induce cell death (apoptosis) and inhibit colon carcinogenesis, it is critical to know the structures of GluCer present in plants as a first step toward understanding this potential link between diet and cancer. This study characterized the molecular species of GluCer from soybean and wheat by low-resolution, high-resolution and tandem mass spectrometry. Soybean GluCer was comprised primarily (>95%) of ceramide with 4,8-sphingadiene (d18:2(delta4,delta8)) and alpha-hydroxypalmitic acid (h16:0); the remainder had the same backbone with h18:0, h20:0, h22:0 and h24:0 fatty acids. Wheat GluCer had three major ceramide, d18:2(delta4,delta8) with h16:0, d18:1(delta8) with h16:0 and d18: 2(delta4,delta8) with h20:0, and smaller amounts of other homologs. These backbones differ from those of mammalian sphingolipids, which often have a delta4-double bond (but rarely a delta8-double bond), and have alpha-hydroxy fatty acids in only some cases. Previously unexplained fragmentations that were diagnostic for the type of sphingoid base backbone (i.e. by homolytic cleavage of the doubly allylic C-6-C-7 bond to yield a stable distonic allylic radical cation and an allylic radical neutral) were also identified.

Our study revealed that some of the plants contained high concentrations of total pipecolic acid, and a higher portion of L-isomer than D-isomer. Loading tests demonstrated that plasma levels and urinary excretion of D-isomer increased significantly 2 h after soybean juice ingestion. Plasma lysine levels showed a similar increase to that of D-isomer. These findings suggest that plasma pipecolic acid, particularly the D-isomer, originates mainly from the catabolism of dietary lysine by intestinal bacteria rather than by direct food intake and that D- and L-isomer may have different mechanisms of metabolism. Moreover, these findings may be important for clarifying the pathogenesis of peroxisomal disorders.",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,"['D002851', 'D004032', 'D006801', 'D008239', 'D010875', 'D010945', 'D013025', 'D013056', 'D013237']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diet', 'Humans', 'Lysine', 'Pipecolic Acids', 'Plants, Edible', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Stereoisomerism']",Origin of D- and L-pipecolic acid in human physiological fluids: a study of the catabolic mechanism to pipecolic acid using the lysine loading test.,"['Q000379', None, None, 'Q000008', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['methods', None, None, 'administration & dosage', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10509903,1999

Cereal and pulse samples were collected from open markets in north-eastern China, and analyzed by inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS) for two potentially hazardous heavy metals--lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd). The average Pb level in cereals (31.3 ng Pb/g as a geometric mean) and that of pulses (25.7 ng Pb/g) were similar to each other with no significant difference. Among the cereals, Pb contents were higher in foxtail millet (54.3 ng/g) and lower in maize (35.4 ng Pb/g; grain and flour in combination), wheat flour (28.8 ng Pb/g) and rice flour (22.7 ng Pb/g). Lead levels in two important types of pulses, kidney bean and soybean (24.6 and 30.8 ng Pb/g, respectively), were comparable to the levels in rice and wheat. In contrast, Cd levels were substantially higher in pulses (55.7 ng Cd/g) than in cereals (9.2 ng Cd/g), and among the pulses, Cd in soybean (55.7 ng Cd/g) was significantly higher than that in kidney bean (23.8 ng Cd/g).

Two DNA breaking components in the ethyl acetate extract of soy sauce were identified as fragrant components, 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone (DMHF) and 4-hydroxy-2(or 5)-ethyl-5(or 2)-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (HEMF), in addition to the previously characterized DNA breaking fragrant component 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (HMF) (Hiramoto et al., 1996b). Characterization of DNA breaking activity of HEMF was performed, and the mechanisms for the breaking were considered. HEMF cleaved the single strands of supercoiled pBR 322 DNA at pH 7.4 dose dependently and time dependently. DNA breaking was inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, hydroxyl radical scavengers, spin trapping agents and metal chelators, and enhanced by Fe(III) ion. Electron spin resonance-spin trapping technique revealed the generation of hydroxyl radical. Hence, active oxygen species derived from interaction of HEMF with metal ions and oxygen participated in the cleavage.

9492344,"Equol is an isoflavonoid phytoestrogen produced from the soy isoflavone daidzein by gut microflora. Not all humans produce equol from daidzein, presumably due to differences in colonic bacterial populations among individuals. Previously, smaller studies reported that approximately 30% of participants excreted equol when consuming soy. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of equol excreters in a larger sample and to examine what dietary components might influence the tendency to be an equol excreter. Thirty men and thirty women consumed a soy protein beverage containing 22 mg genistein and 8 mg daidzein for 4 days as a supplement to their habitual diets. The mean daily nutrient content of their habitual intakes was determined from 4-day food records. On Day 4, participants provided a 24-hour urine collection. Urinary isoflavonoid (genistein, daidzein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) excretion was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Twenty-one of the 60 participants (35%) excreted equol (> 2000 nmol/day) after 3 days of consuming the soy supplement. Daily equol excretion ranged from 2,134-20,301 nmol/day in the excreters and 21-233 nmol/day in the nonexcreters. There was no difference in equol excreter prevalence between men (43%) and women (27%). Daily excretion of daidzein, genistein, and O-desmethylangolensin was similar between equol excreters and nonexcreters and between men and women. Among the women, equol excreters consumed a significantly higher percentage of energy as carbohydrate and greater amounts of plant protein and dietary fiber, both as soluble and insoluble fiber compared to nonexcreters. Such differences were not observed in the men, who overall had significantly higher fiber intakes than the women. These data suggest that, among women, dietary fiber or other components of a high-fiber diet may promote the growth and/or the activity of bacterial populations responsible for equol production in the colon.","Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

8655094,"It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 mg/person, respectively.

8886128,"The isoflavonoids in soy, genistein and daidzein, have been proposed to contribute an important part of the anti-cancer effect of soy. Although there have been many interesting studies on the effects of isoflavones on biochemical targets in tissue culture experiments, in most cases the concentrations used by investigators have exceeded 10 microM. However, based on simple pharmacokinetic calculations involving daily intake of isoflavones, absorption from the gut, distribution to peripheral tissues, and excretion, it is unlikely that blood isoflavone concentrations even in high soy consumers could be greater than 1-5 microM. Experiments designed to evaluate these pharmacological principles were carried out in anesthetized rats with indwelling biliary catheters and in human volunteers consuming soy beverages. The data from these experiments indicate that genistein is efficiently absorbed from the gut, taken up by the liver and excreted in the bile as its 7-O-beta-glucuronide. Re-infused genistein 7-O-beta-glucuronide was also well absorbed from the gut, although this occurred in the distal small intestine. In human subjects fed a soy beverage for a period of two weeks, plasma levels of genistein and daidzein, determined by HPLC-mass spectrometry, ranged from 0.55-0.86 microM, mostly as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In summary, genistein is well absorbed from the small intestine and undergoes an enterohepatic circulation. Although the plasma genistein levels achievable with soy food feeding are unlikely to be sufficient to inhibit the growth of mature, established breast cancer cells by chemotherapeutic-like mechanisms, these levels are sufficient to regulate the proliferation of epithelial cells in the breast and thereby may cause a chemopreventive effect.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"['D000818', 'D000972', 'D001646', 'D004341', 'D004354', 'D004791', 'D005260', 'D019833', 'D006801', 'D007408', 'D007529', 'D008297', 'D015394', 'D008517', 'D011505', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D013025']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Bile', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Isoflavones', 'Male', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phytotherapy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Soybeans']",Soy isoflavonoids and cancer prevention.

7891207,"Antioxidant biofactor: AOB is a unique processed grain food. It is a yellow-green powder. It contains the following extracts: germ extracts, soybean, rice bran, tear grass, sesame, wheat, citron, green tea, green leaf extract, and malted rice. These materials were slowly roasted under a powdered oure at less than 60 degrees C and fermented with Aspergillus oryzae over 3 days to transform each ingredient into low molecular weight substances. These conditions were different by each material, environmental humidity and temperature. It probably contains a variety of substances having antioxidant activity including flavonoids, alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, and tannins. We investigated its antioxidative properties using electron spin resonance (ESR) and autoxidation of rat brain homogenates. The superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and the stable free radical, diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of AOB was investigated using ESR spectrometry. In an in vitro study, a suspension of AOB was added directly to a superoxide generating system (hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase; HX/XO) and investigated using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trapping agent. At final concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/ml, AOB dose-dependent scavenging activity was observed as 0.103, 0.619, and 1.369 U/ml, respectively. A concentration of 1.0 mg/ml completely scavenged DMPO-OOH signals; 1.0 mg/ml of AOB inhibited the DMPO-OH signal generated by Fenton's reaction, but its inhibitory effect was not competitive, and was inhibition of the Fenton's reaction. 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/ml of AOB were significantly inhibited the DPPH radical. In an in vivo study, rats were fed AOB orally at doses of 1 or 5 g/day for 24 h or for 3 days and the superoxide scavenging activity was measured in plasma. With the administration of 1 g/day for 3 days, the superoxide scavenging activity was about 1.8 times that of the control group fed a basal diet; 1.5 times the control with 5 g/day for 1 day, and 2.6 times the control with 5 g/day for 3 days, all of which represented significant increases in superoxide scavenging activity. AOB strongly inhibited the autoxidation of rat brain homogenates in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. However, each ingredient before roast and fermentation little inhibited lipid peroxidation. Roasting and fermentation with A. oryzae way be important to transform each ingredient into low molecular weight substances.

The influence of different concentration characteristics on the fumigation and the decomposition of phosphine residues was investigated in accordance with the fumigation technique. At the beginning the concentration increases, and after attaining the maximum gradually decreases to zero. The level of residues during the fumigation as well as the behaviour of residues during the storage of the fumigated products was monitored with a gas chromatographic method. The residues correlate with the concentration of phosphine, they also pass through a peak. The rate of decomposition of residues which had been formed in the phase of increasing concentration is greater than the rate of residues of equal magnitude which had been formed during the decreasing phase. When the concentration is even the maximum residue occurs later than the maximum concentration; when there is a steep trend both maximums coincide. This behaviour can be explained by the sorption and diffusion of phosphine. A comparison is made with the phosphine concentration which occurs during fumigation in practice. The parameters which produce a constant concentration trend with only one maximum and a non constant trend with an often increasing and decreasing concentration are discussed. The different behaviour of residues in these cases is described.

The amino acid profile from each source was scored against three reference patterns, each based on an estimate of human essential amino acid requirements. Protein quality ratings based on chemical score were variable. Both the chemical score and predicted first-limiting amino acid for a given protein often differed with data source and choice of reference pattern. Some of the predictions contradicted those previously validated by bioassays. The variability in protein quality ratings was reduced somewhat by expressing the data as essential amino acid indices. But this also reduced the degree of difference in protein quality among the various proteins. Although the amino acid profile of food proteins provides an important perspective on their nutritive value, it appears that the imprecision and uncertain accuracy of routine hydrolysis and analytical procedures confound the use of amino acid data for regulating protein quality.

557975,"A glucose acceptor was isolated from soya beans by extraction with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), followed by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography of the extract. This acceptor could not be distinguished from liver dolichyl monophosphate by t.l.c. It could replace dolichyl monophosphate as a mannose acceptor with a liver enzyme and its glucosylated derivative could replace dolichyl monophosphate glucose as a glucose donor in the same system. These results, together with those already reported [Pont Lezica, Brett, Romero Martinez & Dankert (1975) Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun. 66, 980-987], indicate that the acceptor from soya bean is a dolichyl monophosphate. Gel filtration of its glucosylated derivative on Sephadex G-75 in the presence of sodium deoxycholate indicated that the acceptor contained 17 or 18 isoprene units. An enzyme preparation from pea seedlings was shown to use endogenous acceptors to form lipid phosphate sugars containing mannose and N-acetylglucosamine from GDP-mannose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Chromatographic and degradative techniques indicated that the compounds formed were lipid monophosphate mannose, lipid pyrophosphate N-acetylglucosamine, lipid pyrophosphate chitobiose and a series of lipid pyrophosphate oligosaccharides containing both mannose and N-acetylglucosamine. None of these compounds was degraded by catalytic hydrogenation, and so the lipid moiety in each case was probably an alpha-saturated polyprenol.
