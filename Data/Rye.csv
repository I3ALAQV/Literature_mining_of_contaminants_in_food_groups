35173144,"Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disorder induced by consuming gluten proteins from wheat, barley, and rye. Glutens resist gastrointestinal proteolysis, resulting in peptides that elicit inflammation in patients with CeD. Despite well-established connections between glutens and CeD, chemically defined, bioavailable peptides produced from dietary proteins have never been identified from humans in an unbiased manner. This is largely attributable to technical challenges, impeding our knowledge of potentially diverse peptide species that encounter the immune system. Here, we develop a liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric workflow for untargeted sequence analysis of the urinary peptidome. We detect over 600 distinct dietary peptides, of which ~35% have a CeD-relevant T cell epitope and ~5% are known to stimulate innate immune responses. Remarkably, gluten peptides from patients with CeD qualitatively and quantitatively differ from controls. Our results provide a new foundation for understanding gluten immunogenicity, improving CeD management, and characterizing the dietary and urinary peptidomes.",Nature communications,"['D000595', 'D002446', 'D002853', 'D018984', 'D005983', 'D001467', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D020543', 'D012434', 'D013601', 'D014908', 'D014556']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Glutens', 'Hordeum', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Proteome', 'Secale', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Triticum', 'Urine']",An efficient urine peptidomics workflow identifies chemically defined dietary gluten peptides from patients with celiac disease.,"[None, 'Q000276', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000276', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'immunology', None, 'immunology', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'immunology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35173144,2022
34848764,"Prolamins, alcohol soluble storage proteins of the Triticeae tribe of Gramineae family, are known as gliadin, secalin and hordein in wheat, rye and barley respectively. Prolamins were extracted from fifteen cultivars using DuPont protocol to study their physiochemical, morphological and structural characteristics. SDS-PAGE of prolamins showed well resolved low molecular weight proteins with significant amount of albumin and globulin as cross-contaminant. The β-sheet (32.72-37.41%) and β-turn (30.36-37.91%) were found higher in gliadins, while α-helix (20.32-28.95%) and random coil (9.05-10.28%) in hordeins. The high colloidal stability as depicted by zeta-potential was observed in gliadins (23.5-27.0 mV) followed secalins (11.2-16.6 mV) and hordeins (4.1-7.8 mV). Surface morphology by SEM illustrated the globular particle arrangement in gliadins, sheet like arrangement in secalins and stacked flaky particle arrangement in hordeins fraction. TEM studies showed that secalin and hordein fractions were globular in shape while gliadins in addition to globular structure also possessed rod-shaped particle arrangement. XRD pattern of prolamin fractions showed the ordered crystalline domain at 2θ values of 44.1°, 37.8° and 10.4°.

34449959,"The development of crop varieties that are resistant to lodging is a top priority for breeding programmes. Herein, we characterize the rye mutant ´Stabilstroh' ('stable straw') possessing an exceptional combination of high lodging resistance, tall posture and high biomass production. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging displayed the 3-dimensional assembly of vascular bundles in stem. A higher number of vascular bundles and a higher degree of their incline were the features of lodging-resistant versus lodging-prone lines. Histology and electron microscopy revealed that stems are fortified by a higher proportion of sclerenchyma and thickened cell walls, as well as some epidermal invaginations. Biochemical analysis using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry further identified elevated levels of lignin, xylan, zinc and silicon as features associated with high lodging resistance. Combined effects of above features caused superior culm stability. A simplistic mathematical model showed how mechanical forces distribute within the stem under stress. Main traits of the lodging-resistant parental line were heritable and could be traced back to the genetic structure of the mutant. Evaluation of lodging-resistant wheat 'Babax' ('Baviacora') versus contrasting, lodging-prone, genotype ´Pastor´ agreed with above findings on rye.

32854310,"Food allergies are a global food challenge. For correct food labelling, the detection and quantification of allergens are necessary. However, novel product formulations and industrial processes produce new scenarios, which require much more technological developments. For this purpose, OMICS technologies, especially proteomics, seemed to be relevant in this context. This review summarises the current knowledge and studies that used proteomics to study food allergens. In the case of the allergenic proteins, a wide variety of isoforms, post-translational modifications and other structural changes during food processing can increase or decrease the allergenicity. Most of the plant-based food allergens are proteins with biological functions involved in storage, structure, and plant defence. The allergenicity of these proteins could be increased by the presence of heavy metals, air pollution, and pesticides. Targeted proteomics like selected/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) have been very useful, especially in the case of gluten from wheat, rye and barley, and allergens from lentil, soy, and fruit. Conventional 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting have been further widely used. For animal-based food allergens, the widely used technologies are 1D and 2-DE immunoblotting followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF, and more recently LC-MS/MS, which is becoming useful to assess egg, fish, or milk allergens.

31921226,"The consumption of wheat, rye, and barley may cause adverse reactions to wheat such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity, or wheat allergy. The storage proteins (gluten) are known as major triggers, but also other functional protein groups such as α-amylase/trypsin-inhibitors or enzymes are possibly harmful for people suffering of adverse reactions to wheat. Gluten is widely used as a collective term for the complex protein mixture of wheat, rye or barley and can be subdivided into the following gluten protein types (GPTs): α-gliadins, γ-gliadins, ω5-gliadins, ω1,2-gliadins, high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits of wheat, ω-secalins, high-molecular-weight secalins, γ-75k-secalins and γ-40k-secalins of rye, and C-hordeins, γ-hordeins, B-hordeins, and D-hordeins of barley. GPTs isolated from the flours are useful as reference materials for clinical studies, diagnostics or in food analyses and to elucidate disease mechanisms. A combined strategy of protein separation according to solubility followed by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography was employed to purify the GPTs according to hydrophobicity. Due to the heterogeneity of gluten proteins and their partly polymeric nature, it is a challenge to obtain highly purified GPTs with only one protein group. Therefore, it is essential to characterize and identify the proteins and their proportions in each GPT. In this study, the complexity of gluten from wheat, rye, and barley was demonstrated by identification of the individual proteins employing an undirected proteomics strategy involving liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic and chymotryptic hydrolysates of the GPTs. Different protein groups were obtained and the relative composition of the GPTs was revealed. Multiple reaction monitoring liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used for the relative quantitation of the most abundant gluten proteins. These analyses also allowed the identification of known wheat allergens and celiac disease-active peptides. Combined with functional assays, these findings may shed light on the mechanisms of gluten/wheat-related disorders and may be useful to characterize reference materials for analytical or diagnostic assays more precisely.",Frontiers in plant science,[],[],"Characterization and Relative Quantitation of Wheat, Rye, and Barley Gluten Protein Types by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31921226,2020

For predisposed people, gluten presents epitopes able to stimulate T-cells causing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, among others unrelated to the gastrointestinal system. The only treatment for CD is to maintain a gluten-free diet, not exceeding 20 mg/kg of gluten, what is generally considered the safe amount for celiacs. Due to this context, it is very important to identify and quantify the gluten content of food products. ELISA is the most commonly used method to detect gluten traces in food. However, by detecting only prolamins, the results of ELISA tests may be underestimated. For this reason, more reliable and sensitive assays are needed to improve gluten quantification. Because of high sensitivity and the ability to detect even trace amounts of peptides in complex matrices, the most promising approaches to verify the presence of gluten peptides in food are non-immunological techniques, like liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Different methodologies using this approach have been developed and described in the last years, ranging from non-targeted and exploratory analysis to targeted and specific methods depending on the purpose of interest. Non-targeted analyses aim to define the proteomic profile of the sample, while targeted analyses allow the search for specific peptides, making it possible to quantify them. This review aims to gather and summarize the main proteomic techniques used in the identification and quantitation of gluten peptides related to CD-activity and gluten-related allergies.",Frontiers in plant science,[],[],Modern Approaches in the Identification and Quantification of Immunogenic Peptides in Cereals by LC-MS/MS.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798614,2020
31681788,"The safety of oats for people with celiac disease remains unresolved. While oats have attractive nutritional properties that can improve the quality and palatability of the restrictive, low fiber gluten-free diet, rigorous feeding studies to address their safety in celiac disease are needed. Assessing the oat prolamin proteins (avenins) in isolation and controlling for gluten contamination and other oat components such as fiber that can cause non-specific effects and symptoms is crucial. Further, the avenin should contain all reported immunogenic T cell epitopes, and be deliverable at a dose that enables biological responses to be correlated with clinical effects. To date, isolation of a purified food-grade avenin in sufficient quantities for feeding studies has not been feasible. Here, we report a new gluten isolation technique that enabled 2 kg of avenin to be extracted from 400 kg of wheat-free oats under rigorous gluten-free and food grade conditions. The extract consisted of 85% protein of which 96% of the protein was avenin. The concentration of starch (1.8% dry weight), β-glucan (0.2% dry weight), and free sugars (1.8% dry weight) were all low in the final avenin preparation. Other sugars including oligosaccharides, small fructans, and other complex sugars were also low at 2.8% dry weight. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the proteins in these preparations showed they consisted only of oat proteins and were uncontaminated by gluten containing cereals including wheat, barley or rye. Proteomic analysis of the avenin enriched samples detected more avenin subtypes and fewer other proteins compared to samples obtained using other extraction procedures. The identified proteins represented five main groups, four containing known immune-stimulatory avenin peptides. All five groups were identified in the 50% (v/v) ethanol extract however the group harboring the epitope DQ2.5-ave-1b was less represented. The avenin-enriched protein fractions were quantitatively collected by reversed phase HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Three reverse phase HPLC peaks, representing ~40% of the protein content, were enriched in proteins containing DQ2.5-ave-1a epitope. The resultant high quality avenin will facilitate controlled and definitive feeding studies to establish the safety of oat consumption by people with celiac disease.",Frontiers in nutrition,[],[],Preparation and Characterization of Avenin-Enriched Oat Protein by Chill Precipitation for Feeding Trials in Celiac Disease.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681788,2020
31629960,"Gluten, a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye, is the trigger of celiac disease, an immune disorder that affects about 1% of people worldwide. The toxicity of partially hydrolyzed gluten (PHG) in fermented products is less well understood due to the significant analytical challenges in PHG characterization. In this project, an N-terminal labeling mass spectrometry method, terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), was optimized for the in-depth analysis of PHG and validated using a test protease (trypsin) with known cleavage specificity. Gluten N-termini in test and control groups were labeled with heavy and light formaldehyde, respectively. Trypsin-generated neo N-termini were identified by exhibiting an MS1 Log2 H:L peak area ratio with a significant difference (p < .01) from zero and native N-termini with no significant difference from zero (p > .01). Using this strategy, all abundant, theoretical, test protease-generated peptides in exemplar alpha/beta gliadins and gamma gliadins were identified. SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first study that modified and evaluated TAILS analysis for the analysis of partially hydrolyzed gluten proteins. The evaluation indicated that the TAILS analysis could be modified and expanded to the identification of multiple protease cleavage sites in gluten proteins and is worth further evaluation as a novel strategy for the analysis of natural hydrolysis of gluten in food processes. This strategy also may be further applied to characterize a broader range of partially hydrolyzed allergens in foods and provide reference for their safety assessment to both industry and regulatory authorities.",Journal of proteomics,"['D000595', 'D005983', 'D001467', 'D006801', 'D006868', 'D007553', 'D010446', 'D017385', 'D053719', 'D014908']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Glutens', 'Hordeum', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Sequence Homology', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triticum']",Evaluation of N-terminal labeling mass spectrometry for characterization of partially hydrolyzed gluten proteins.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","[None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629960,2021
31614625,"Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten that is associated with gastrointestinal issues, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption. Gluten is a general name for a class of cereal storage proteins of wheat, barley, and rye that are notably resistant to gastrointestinal digestion. After ingestion, immunogenic peptides are subsequently recognized by T cells in the gastrointestinal tract. The only treatment for CD is a life-long gluten-free diet. As such, it is critical to detect gluten in diverse food types, including those where one would not expect to find gluten. The utility of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using cereal-specific peptide markers to detect gluten in heavily processed food types was assessed. A range of breakfast products, including breakfast cereals, breakfast bars, milk-based breakfast drinks, powdered drinks, and a savory spread, were tested. No gluten was detected by LC-MS in the food products labeled gluten-free, yet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measurement revealed inconsistencies in barley-containing products. In products containing wheat, rye, barley, and oats as labeled ingredients, gluten proteins were readily detected using discovery proteomics. Panels comprising ten cereal-specific peptide markers were analyzed by targeted proteomics, providing evidence that LC-MS could detect and differentiate gluten in complex matrices, including baked goods and milk-based products.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D001315', 'D018554', 'D062408', 'D002853', 'D002523', 'D004797', 'D005504', 'D005983', 'D001467', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D040901', 'D014908']","['Australia', 'Avena', 'Breakfast', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Analysis', 'Glutens', 'Hordeum', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Proteomics', 'Triticum']",Assessing the Utility of Multiplexed Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry for Gluten Detection in Australian Breakfast Food Products.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614625,2020

The dough composition, thermal treatment applied during baking, low moisture, and high rate of consumption make biscuits important contributors to daily exposure to acrylamide in Western diets. Acrylamide was determined by LC-ESI-MS/MS in 80 commercial biscuits marketed in Spain. The mean acrylamide content was 343 μg kg-1 (from <20 to 2144 μg kg-1). Rye, teff and oat-based biscuits exhibited the highest content (2144, 1559 and 1424 μg kg-1, respectively). 70% of the samples were below the benchmark level established by the EU Regulation 2017/2158. Compared to our previous prospective study in 2007 on the Spanish market, acrylamide has experienced an important decline (45%) in wheat-based formulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies applied in the sector. However, when all samples were considered, a slight non-significant decrease (18%) was observed. This fact suggests that the reformulation of traditional recipes with innovative cereals and ingredients could increase the acrylamide content in biscuits despite the mitigation strategies applied.

31333027,"Rye, wheat, and barley contain gluten, proteins that trigger immune-mediated inflammation of the small intestine in people with celiac disease (CD). The only treatment for CD is a lifelong gluten-free diet. To be classified as gluten-free by the World Health Organization the gluten content must be below 20 mg/kg, but Australia has a more rigorous standard of no detectable gluten and not made from wheat, barley, rye, or oats. The purpose of this study was to devise an LC-MS/MS method to detect rye in food. An MS-based assay could overcome some of the limitations of immunoassays, wherein antibodies often show cross-reactivity and lack specificity due to the diversity of gluten proteins in commercial food and the homology between rye and wheat gluten isoforms.

31246975,"Gluten is a complex of proteins present in barley, wheat, rye and several varieties of oats that triggers celiac disease in genetically predisposed subjects. Gluten is notoriously difficult to digest by mammalian proteolytic enzymes and therefore, proline-rich digestion-resistant peptides contain multiple immunogenic epitopes. Prolyl endopeptidases (PEP) hydrolyse internal proline residues on the carboxyl side of peptides and have been proposed for food gluten detoxification and as oral enzyme supplementation for celiacs. The aim of this study was to identify new gluten-degrading microbial enzymes with the potential to reduce gluten immunogenicity by neutralizing its antigenic epitopes. Using a gluten-degrading colony screening approach, a bacterial isolate (2RA3) displaying the highest glutenase activity was selected, characterized and its genome completely sequenced. The identification through 16S rDNA gene sequencing showed a 99,1% similarity to Chryseobacterium taeanense. Hydrolysis of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) was further monitored, over a 48-hour period, by colony encapsulation in gliadin-containing microspheres, followed by detection with the G12 anti-GIP monoclonal antibody. Glutenase activity was detected in the extracellular medium of 2RA3 cultures, where gel electrophoresis and gliadin zymography revealed the presence of a ~50 kDa gluten-degrading enzyme. Nano-ESI-Q-TOF of the excised active band identified 7 peptides contained in the protein product predicted for an open reading frame (ORF) in the 2RA3 genome. Based on sequence similarity to the PEP family, the new enzyme was named PEP 2RA3. The PEP 2RA3 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from C. taeanense 2RA3, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminally His-tagged recombinant protein and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein, with predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point of 78.95 kDa and 6.8, respectively, shows PEP activity with standard chromogenic substrates, works optimally at pH 8.0 and 30°C and remains stable at pH 6.0 and 50°C, indicating a potential use in gluten-containing food process applications.

The automatic online clean-up took place during the HILIC-separation in the first dimension (YMC-Pack Diol; 2.1 × 100 mm; 5 μm, 120 Å). Here, polar matrix compounds were retained, while the majority of the analyte scope eluted in a fraction at the beginning of the analytical run.

In this article, we investigate the effect of quercetin 3β-D-rutinoside (rutin) supplementation, at the level of 5⁻50 mg per 100 g, of rye-buckwheat biscuits on the formation of phenolics and volatile Maillard reaction products (MRPs) such as pyrazines, furfuryl alcohol and furfural, determined by headspace solid phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC⁻MS), in addition to the effect on the antioxidant capacity. The study confirmed that rutin was stable under baking conditions as showed by its content in rye-buckwheat biscuits. Supplementation of biscuits with increasing amounts of rutin resulted in the progressive increase of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity measured by DPPH and OxHLIA assays, but it had no effect on their sensory quality. From the eighteen compounds identified by HS-SPME/GC⁻MS in the volatile fraction of biscuits were quantitated as a compounds-of-interest: methylpyrazine, ethylpyrazine, 2,3-; 2,5- and 2,6-dimethylpyrazines, as well as furfural, furfuryl alcohol and hexanal. The rutin supplementation of biscuits might be one of the factors to influence the formation of both desirable volatile compounds and undesirable toxic compounds. In conclusion, this study indicates for the significant role of polyphenols on the formation of volatile compounds in biscuits with possible future application in the development of healthy bakery products with high antioxidant capacity.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000975', 'D019612', 'D005504', 'D008401', 'D015416', 'D010636', 'D064209', 'D012431', 'D055549']","['Antioxidants', 'Fagopyrum', 'Food Analysis', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Maillard Reaction', 'Phenols', 'Phytochemicals', 'Rutin', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']","Determination of Antioxidant Capacity, Phenolics and Volatile Maillard Reaction Products in Rye-Buckwheat Biscuits Supplemented with 3β-d-Rutinoside.","['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862064,2019
30810038,"2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) is a key odorant in many foods, such as aromatic rice and wheat bread, with a very low odor threshold of 0.05 μg/L in water. The small molecule with a popcornlike, roasty odor is generated biologically or by Strecker degradation within the Maillard-reaction cascades during thermal food processing with methylglyoxal and 1-pyrroline as the main direct precursors. Numerous gas-chromatographic methods for the analysis of 2-AP have been published, but the reactivity of the compound leads to discrimination or degradation during sample workup. We developed a novel derivatization method for 2-AP with o-phenylenediamine followed by HPLC-MS/MS analysis of the resulting stable quinoxaline. The precision (7%), repeatability (14%), recovery (92%), linearity (0.79-500 μg/kg), limit of detection (LOD, 0.26 μg/kg), and limit of quantitation (LOQ, 0.79 μg/kg) were validated for rice matrix and were excellent as compared with those of methods published before. With the novel method, 2-AP levels in typical foods like aromatic rice (131 μg/kg), wheat bread (18 μg/kg), brown bread (18 μg/kg), rye bread (18 μg/kg), and popcorn (38 μg/kg) were determined.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001939', 'D002851', 'D005504', 'D009812', 'D012275', 'D011758', 'D053719', 'D014908']","['Bread', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Odorants', 'Oryza', 'Pyrroles', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triticum']",Efficient Analysis of 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline in Foods Using a Novel Derivatization Strategy and LC-MS/MS.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810038,2019
30776456,"Cereal grain proteomics can provide valuable information regarding plant growth, nutritional status, adaptation to environmental stresses, and the role that grain proteins play in health disorders, such as coeliac disease. In this study liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to compare the barley proteome after extraction using seven protocols, with and without defatting and protein precipitation steps that aimed to remove interfering secondary metabolites. Tris-HCl and urea buffers yielded 1405 and 1483 proteins (~79% overlap) from barley (cv Sloop). Inclusion of a pre-extraction defatting step yielded 1336 (Tris-HCl) and 1286 (urea) proteins (~74% overlap). Whilst post-extraction TCA/acetone protein precipitation negatively impacted protein recovery, yielding 673 (Tris-HCl) and 734 (urea) proteins. Alcohol-based extraction yielded a lower number of proteins (645), but notably this extraction method co-extracted and enriched the gluten and α-amylase trypsin inhibitors. Based on these preliminary results, proteins were extracted from two selected cultivars of wheat, rye, barley and oats using three extraction protocols. Bioinformatic analyses of the identified proteins provide evidence that the choice of extraction buffer enriches different protein functional classes. The selection of the protein extraction protocol directly influences the identified cereal grain proteome composition, thus affecting the downstream biological interpretation of data. SIGNIFICANCE: LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis revealed that both Tris-HCl and urea-based extraction yielded a similar suite of proteins from cereal grains with remarkable (70-80%) overlap. Yet the peptides derived from the proteins differed, rendering these extraction buffers complementary, in particular resulting in improved protein sequence coverage.

A large level of genetic diversity for anthocyanin content and composition in the grain of different species was observed. In rye, recessive mutations in six genes (vi1...vi6) lead to the absence of anthocyanins in all parts of the plant. Moreover, dominant genes of anthocyanin synthesis in aleurone (gene C) and pericarp (gene Vs) also affect the color of the grain. Reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to study anthocyanins in 24 rye samples. A lack of anthocyanins in the lines with yellow and brown grain was determined. Delphinidin rutinoside and cyanidin rutinoside were found in the green-seeded lines. Six samples with violet grains significantly varied in terms of anthocyanin composition and content. However, the main aglycone was cyanidin or peonidin in all of them. Monosaccharide glucose and disaccharide rutinose served as the glycoside units. Violet-seeded accession forms differ in the ratio of the main anthocyanins and the range of their acylated derivatives. The acyl groups were presented mainly by radicals of malonic and sinapic acids. For the colored forms, a profile of the revealed anthocyanins with the indication of their contents was given.

29487607,"Used as a hardening agent in lead bullets, antimony (Sb) has become a major contaminant in shooting range soils of some countries including Switzerland. Soil contamination by Sb is also an environmental problem in countries with Sb-mining activities such as China and Bolivia. Because of its toxicity and relatively high mobility, there is concern over the risk of Sb transfer from contaminated soils into plants, and thus into the food chain. In particular there is very little information on the environmental behavior of methylated antimony, which can be produced by microbial biomethylation of inorganic Sb in contaminated soils. Using a new extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) method, we investigated antimony speciation in roots and shoots of wheat, fescue, rye, and ryegrass plants exposed to trimethyl antimony(V) (TMSb), antimonite (Sb(III)), and antimonate (Sb(V)) in hydroponics. The total root Sb concentrations followed the order Sb(III) treatment > Sb(V) treatment > TMSb treatment, except for fescue. Shoot Sb concentrations, however, did not differ among the three treatments. In the Sb(V) treatment small quantities of TMSb were found in the roots, whereas no TMSb was detected in the roots of Sb(III)-treated plants. In contrast, similar concentrations of TMSb were found in the shoots in both inorganic Sb treatments. The results indicate that biomethylation of Sb may occur in plants. In the TMSb treatment TMSb was the major Sb species, but the two inorganic Sb species were also found both in shoots and roots along with some unknown Sb species, suggesting that also TMSb demethylation may occur within plant tissues. The results furthermore indicate that methylated Sb is more mobile in plants than inorganic Sb species. Knowledge about this is important in risk assessments of Sb-contaminated sites, as methylation may render Sb more toxic than inorganic Sb, as it is known for arsenic (As).",Frontiers in plant science,[],[],Uptake and Transformation of Methylated and Inorganic Antimony in Plants.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29487607,2020
29425234,"Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disorder of the upper small intestine caused by the ingestion of storage proteins (prolamins and glutelins) from wheat, barley, rye, and, in rare cases, oats. CD patients need to follow a gluten-free diet by consuming gluten-free products with gluten contents of less than 20 mg/kg. Currently, the recommended method for the quantitative determination of gluten is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the R5 monoclonal antibody. Because the R5 ELISA mostly detects the prolamin fraction of gluten, a new independent method is required to detect prolamins as well as glutelins. This paper presents the development of a method to quantitate 16 wheat marker peptides derived from all wheat gluten protein types by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The quantitation of each marker peptide in the chymotryptic digest of a defined amount of the respective reference wheat protein type resulted in peptide-specific yields. This enabled the conversion of peptide into protein type concentrations. Gluten contents were expressed as sum of all determined protein type concentrations.

Based on the pesticide levels recovered from each of the different millings and the corresponding particle size distributions, it was confirmed that smaller average particle sizes increase the extraction efficiency up to 31%, with all other factors equal. The cereals milled at room temperature produced lower pesticide extraction efficiencies compared with cereals milled when still frozen, especially for heat-sensitive pesticides.

In order to make a precise assessment of the importance of the 33-mer, it is necessary to elucidate which wheat species and cultivars contain the peptide and at which concentrations. This paper presents the development of a stable isotope dilution assay followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantitate the 33-mer in flours of 23 hexaploid modern and 15 old common (bread) wheat as well as two spelt cultivars. All flours contained the 33-mer peptide at levels ranging from 91-603 μg/g flour. In contrast, the 33-mer was absent (<limit of detection) from tetra- and diploid species (durum wheat, emmer, einkorn), most likely because of the absence of the D-genome, which encodes α2-gliadins. Due to the presence of the 33-mer in all common wheat and spelt flours analysed here, the special focus in the literature on this most immunodominant peptide seems to be justified.",Scientific reports,"['D002853', 'D005433', 'D005903', 'D016056', 'D010455', 'D012680', 'D053719', 'D014908']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Flour', 'Gliadin', 'Immunodominant Epitopes', 'Peptides', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triticum']",Quantitation of the immunodominant 33-mer peptide from α-gliadin in wheat flours by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28327674,2018
28234993,"Gluten proteins from wheat, rye, barley and, in rare cases, oats, are responsible for triggering hypersensitivity reactions such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy. Well-defined reference materials (RM) are essential for clinical studies, diagnostics, elucidation of disease mechanisms and food analyses to ensure the safety of gluten-free foods. Various RM are currently used, but a thorough characterization of the gluten source, content and composition is often missing. However, this characterization is essential due to the complexity and heterogeneity of gluten to avoid ambiguous results caused by differences in the RM used. A comprehensive strategy to isolate gluten protein fractions and gluten protein types (GPT) from wheat, rye, barley and oat flours was developed to obtain well-defined RM for clinical assays and gluten-free compliance testing. All isolated GPT (ω5-gliadins, ω1,2-gliadins, α-gliadins, γ-gliadins and high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits from wheat, ω-secalins, γ-75k-secalins, γ-40k-secalins and high-molecular-weight secalins from rye, C-hordeins, γ-hordeins, B-hordeins and D-hordeins from barley and avenins from oats) were fully characterized using analytical reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), N-terminal sequencing, electrospray-ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS) and untargeted LC-MS/MS of chymotryptic hydrolyzates of the single GPT.

27873003,"The fungus Claviceps purpurea produces highly toxic ergot alkaloids and accumulates these in the hardened bodies of fungal mycelium. These so-called sclerotia, or ergot bodies, replace the crop seed of infected plants, which can include numerous important food- and feedstuff such as rye and wheat. While several studies have explored details of the infection process and development of ergot bodies, little information is available on the spatial distribution of the mycotoxins in the sclerotia. Here we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) at a lateral resolution of 35 μm to visualize the distribution of two representative alkaloids, ergocristine and ergometrine, produced by Ecc93 and Gal 310 variants of C. purpurea, respectively, after infection of rye. To improve cryosectioning of this fragile biological material tissue with complex texture, we developed a practical embedding protocol based on cellulose polymers. The MALDI-MS images recorded from the so produced intact tissues sections revealed that ergometrine exhibited a relatively homogeneous distribution throughout the ergot body, whereas ergocristine was found to be enriched in the proximal region. This finding can be correlated to the morphological development of sclerotia as ergot alkaloids are only produced in the sphacelial stage. The ability to localize toxins and other secondary metabolites in intact sections of crop-infecting fungi with high lateral resolution renders MALDI-MSI a powerful tool for investigating biosynthetic pathways and for obtaining a deeper understanding of the parasite-host interaction.

27469368,"Gluten are proline- and glutamine-rich proteins present in wheat, barley, and rye and contain the immunogenic sequences that drive celiac disease (CD). Rothia mucilaginosa, an oral microbial colonizer, can cleave these gluten epitopes. The aim was to isolate and identify the enzymes and evaluate their potential as novel enzyme therapeutics for CD. The membrane-associated R. mucilaginosa proteins were extracted and separated by DEAE chromatography. Enzyme activities were monitored with paranitroanilide-derivatized and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptide substrates, and by gliadin zymography. Epitope elimination was determined in R5 and G12 ELISAs. The gliadin-degrading Rothia enzymes were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS as hypothetical proteins ROTMU0001_0241 (C6R5V9_9MICC), ROTMU0001_0243 (C6R5W1_9MICC), and ROTMU0001_240 (C6R5V8_9MICC). A search with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool revealed that these are subtilisin-like serine proteases belonging to the peptidase S8 family. Alignment of the major Rothia subtilisins indicated that all contain the catalytic triad with Asp (D), His (H), and Ser (S) in the D-H-S order. They cleaved succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-paranitroanilide, a substrate for subtilisin with Pro in the P2 position, as in Tyr-Pro-Gln and Leu-Pro-Tyr in gluten, which are also cleaved. Consistently, FRET substrates of gliadin immunogenic epitopes comprising Xaa-Pro-Xaa motives were rapidly hydrolyzed. The Rothia subtilisins and two subtilisins from Bacillus licheniformis, subtilisin A and the food-grade Nattokinase, efficiently degraded the immunogenic gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide and the immunodominant epitopes recognized by the R5 and G12 antibodies.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are recommended for gluten analysis to monitor the compliance of gluten-free products to the Codex threshold of 20 mg gluten/kg. However, due to the specific features of each gluten ELISA test kit, the results often deviate systematically and largely depend on the characteristics of the antibody. This comprehensive study assessed the specificities and sensitivities of three monoclonal (R5, G12, and Skerritt) and two polyclonal antibodies to the alcohol-soluble prolamin and alcohol-insoluble glutelin fractions of gluten from wheat, rye, and barley, all of which harbor CD-active epitopes. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography served as independent reference method to quantify gluten protein concentrations and allow comparisons of different gluten fractions within one kit and between kits. Wheat prolamins were detected quite accurately by all antibodies, but high variability between antibody specificities and sensitivities was observed for rye and barley prolamins and rye glutelins, and the largest discrepancies were found for wheat and barley glutelins. The gluten content (sum of prolamins and glutelins) was either overestimated up to six times (rye) or underestimated up to seven times (barley). Overestimation of gluten contents may unnecessarily limit the availability of gluten-free products, but underestimation represents a serious health risk for CD patients. It is important to consider these differences between antibodies used in kits and consider what each kit is capable of measuring, especially with samples where the source of gluten is unknown.

26994601,"Accurate, reliable and sensitive detection methods for gluten are required to support current EU regulations. The enforcement of legislative levels requires that measurement results are comparable over time and between methods. This is not a trivial task for gluten which comprises a large number of protein targets. This paper describes a strategy for defining a set of specific analytical targets for wheat gluten. A comprehensive proteomic approach was applied by fractionating wheat gluten using RP-HPLC (reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography) followed by a multi-enzymatic digestion (LysC, trypsin and chymotrypsin) with subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. This approach identified 434 peptide sequences from gluten. Peptides were grouped based on two criteria: unique to a single gluten protein sequence; contained known immunogenic and toxic sequences in the context of coeliac disease. An LC-MS/MS method based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for the specific detection of the target peptides. The SRM based screening approach was applied to gluten containing cereals (wheat, rye, barley and oats) and non-gluten containing flours (corn, soy and rice). A unique set of wheat gluten marker peptides were identified and are proposed as wheat specific markers.",Journal of proteomics,"['D015415', 'D002446', 'D002851', 'D005983', 'D040901', 'D013045', 'D053719', 'D014908']","['Biomarkers', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Glutens', 'Proteomics', 'Species Specificity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triticum']",Defining the wheat gluten peptide fingerprint via a discovery and targeted proteomics approach.,"['Q000032', 'Q000209', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'etiology', None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26994601,2017
26988518,"Phenolic compounds in beer have received considerable interest. Besides the more typical phenolic acids and flavonoids, beer contains also lesser-known compounds, such as hordatines, their agmatine precursors and other phenolamines. Current work shows that beers brewed from wheat or rye malts, in addition to barley malts, contain benzoxazinoids, a group of nitrogen containing secondary metabolites typical to wheat and rye. In this work, HPLC-DAD was used for the quantification of major benzoxazinoids in 32 wheat and four rye beers. Of the wheat beers 22 samples and all of the rye beers contained benzoxazinoids, or their breakdown products. Concentrations of DIBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one) (as aglycon) varied from 1.7 to 21.9mg/l in wheat beers and from 5.6 to 31.6mg/l in rye beers. Breakdown products BOA (benzoxazolin-2-one), found in 15 beers, and MBOA (6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2-one), found in two beers, were measured at concentrations ranging from 2.4 to 10.7mg/l and 8.4 to 10.5mg/l, respectively. Identification of benzoxazinoids by UPLC-QTOF MS was done on selected beers. Benzoxazinoid profiles varied greatly between different wheat beers, and compared to rye beers the chemical diversity of benzoxazinoids was higher. As far as the authors know, this is the first time that other benzoxazinoids, rather than just the decomposition products BOA or MBOA, have been reported in beer. The results also show that benzoxazinoids can be present in beer glycosylated with three or four hexose units.",Food chemistry,"['D001515', 'D048588', 'D001583', 'D002851', 'D062385', 'D013058', 'D010936', 'D012434', 'D014908']","['Beer', 'Benzoxazines', 'Benzoxazoles', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Hydroxybenzoates', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Plant Extracts', 'Secale', 'Triticum']",Determination of benzoxazinoids in wheat and rye beers by HPLC-DAD and UPLC-QTOF MS.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26988518,2016
26947163,"The analysis of ergot alkaloids is generally performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to fluorescence detection (FLD) or mass selective detection. As for monitoring only the sum of ergot alkaloids is relevant, a fast and easy screening method for the determination of the total alkaloid content was developed using planar solid phase extraction (pSPE). Applying pSPE, recently introduced for pesticide residue analysis in fruits and vegetables (Oellig and Schwack, 2011) and tea (Oellig and Schwack, 2012), all ergot alkaloids are concentrated in a target zone followed by detection as the sum. The herein presented method includes an ammonium acetate buffered extraction step, followed by a fast liquid-liquid partitioning pre-cleaning before pSPE is performed on high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) amino plates with a single methanol development to separate the ergot alkaloids from the remaining matrix and to collect them in a single zone. For quantitation, the native fluorescence was used after dipping the plate in n-hexane/paraffin solution for fluorescence enhancement. Limits of detection and quantitation of 0.07 and 0.24 mg/kg rye, respectively, expressed as ergocristine, were well below the currently applied quality criterion limit for rye. Near-100% recoveries were obtained at relevant spiking levels for different rye flour samples. Hence, the fast pSPE-FLD is an efficient and reliable method to screen for the total ergot alkaloid content in rye and a rapid alternative to the HPLC determination of individual alkaloids and to summing them up. HPTLC-MS additionally enables the identification of the ergot alkaloid composition by a single mass spectrum, when utilized as a fingerprint, offering an easy differentiation of Secale cornutum from different origins.",Journal of chromatography.

Although it is hypothesized that structural complexity and abundance of these feruloylated arabinoxylan side-chains may contribute, among other factors, to resistance of plant cell walls to enzymatic degradation, quantitative profiling approaches for these structural units in plant cell wall materials have not been described yet. Here we report the development and application of a rapid and robust method enabling the quantitative comparison of feruloylated side-chain profiles in cell wall materials following mildly acidic hydrolysis, C18-solid phase extraction (SPE), reduction under aprotic conditions, and liquid chromatography with diode-array detection/mass spectrometry (LC-DAD/MS) separation and detection. The method was applied to the insoluble fiber/cell wall materials isolated from 12 whole grains: wild rice (Zizania aquatica L.), long-grain brown rice (Oryza sativa L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), kamut (Triticum turanicum Jakubz.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), spelt (Triticum spelta L.), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), maize (Zea mays L.), popcorn (Zea mays L. var. everta), oat (Avena sativa L.)

Between 51 and 96% of the total esterified monomeric ferulates were represented in the quantified compounds captured in the feruloylated side-chain profiles, which confirms the significance of these structures to the global arabinoxylan structure in terms of quantity.

By using calibration standards in cucumber matrix, recovery and precision were calculated in lettuce, orange and wheat for 109 pesticides at 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) in two sets of samples: one with and one without clean-up. For both spiking levels, 80-82% of the pesticides in the non-cleaned extracts and 80-84% of the pesticides in the cleaned extracts were within the acceptable recovery range of 70-120%. Precision data for both levels showed that 95% of the pesticides in the non-cleaned extracts and 93-95% of the pesticides in the cleaned extracts had RSDs below 20%. Recovery and precision data were determined using a two tailed t-test (p = 0.05). By using calibration standards in the respective matrix, we studied if the non-cleaned calibration standards gave an extra matrix effect compared with the cleaned standards by using the slope from calibration graphs and plotting the calculated extra matrix effect minus 100 for each compound. The results showed that for 79% of the pesticides, the extra matrix effect minus 100 was within the acceptable range of -20% to 20%. Five European Union proficiency tests on rye, mandarin, rice, pear and barley, respectively, from 2010 to 2012 were reanalysed omitting the clean-up step and showed satisfactory results. At least 70 injections of non-cleaned extracts were made without detecting any increased need for maintenance during the experimental period. Analysing non-cleaned QuEChERS extracts of lettuce, orange and wheat are possible under the conditions described in this paper because recovery, precision and specificity showed satisfactory results compared with samples subjected to traditional dispersive clean-up.

Proteins in the oat seed extracts were optimized for their amylolytic activities. Oat extract with amylolytic activity was separated by SDS-PAGE and a major protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa was subjected to tryptic digestion. The generated amino acid sequences were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS) and database searches. These sequences were used to identify a partial cDNA from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of A. sativa L. Based upon EST sequences, a predicted full-length gene was identified, with an open reading frame of 1464 bp encoding a protein of 488 amino acid residues (AsBAMY), with a theoretical molecular mass of 55 kDa identified as a β-amylase belonging to the plant β-amylase family. Primary structure of oat β-amylase (AsBAMY) protein indicated high similarity with other β-amylase from other cereals such as wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and rye (Secale cereale) with two conserved Glu residues (E184 and E378) assigned as the “putative” catalytic residues which would act as an acid and base pair in the catalytic process.

To this aim, unique marker peptides were properly selected in order to distinguish between the different cereal types. A revised cocktail solution based on reducing and denaturing agents was exploited for prolamin extraction from raw and processed food; in addition, defatting with hexane was carried out for sample clean-up, allowing to largely reduce problems related to matrix effect. Method validation on fortified rice flour showed good analytical performance in terms of sensitivity (limits of detection in the 2-18 mg kg(-1) range). However, poor trueness was calculated for self-made incurred bread (between 3 and 30% depending on the peptide), probably due to baking processes, which reduce gluten extractability. Thus, it is evident that in the case of processed foods further insights into sample treatment efficiency and reference materials for protein calibration are required to obtain accurate gluten determination.

Here, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we investigated the proteomics profiles from grains of wheat genotypes, Rye selection 111 (RS111) and Chinese spring (CS), which differ in their size. Significant differences in protein expression were found, including 33 proteins uniquely present in RS111 and 32 only in CS, while 54 proteins were expressed from both genotypes. Among differentially expressed proteins, 22 were upregulated, while 21 proteins were downregulated in RS111 compared to CS. Functional classification revealed their role in energy metabolism, seed storage, stress tolerance and transcription. Further, protein interactive network analysis was performed to predict the targets of identified proteins. Significantly different interactions patterns were observed between these genotypes with detection of proteins such as Cyp450, Sus2, and WRKY that could potentially affect seed size.

25795397,"Celiac disease (CD) is a food-related disease caused by certain gluten peptides containing T-cell stimulating epitopes from wheat, rye, and barley. CD-patients have to maintain a gluten-free diet and are therefore dependent on reliable testing and labeling of gluten-free products. So far, the R5-ELISA is the approved method to detect if food products can be labeled gluten-free. Because the R5-ELISA detects gluten in general, there is a demand for an improved detection method that quantifies specifically CD-epitopes. Therefore, we developed a new method for detection and quantification of CD-epitopes, based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. This method enables targeted label free comparative analysis of the gluten proteins present in different wheat varieties and species, and in wheat-based food products. We have tested our method by analyzing several wheat varieties that vary in CD-epitope content, as was shown before using immunoblotting and specific monoclonal antibodies. The results showed that a modern bread wheat variety Toronto contained the highest amounts of CD immunogenic peptides compared with the older bread wheat variety Minaret and the tetraploid wheat variety Dibillik Sinde.

25454134,"Gluten is the collective name for a class of proteins found in wheat, rye, barley and oats. Eating gluten triggers an inappropriate auto-immune reaction in ∼70 million people globally affected by coeliac disease, where the gut reacts to gluten proteins and this triggers an immune response, resulting in intestinal inflammation and damage. Gluten-free foods are now commonplace, however, it is difficult to accurately determine the gluten content of products claiming to be gluten-free using current methodologies as the antibodies are non-specific, show cross-reactivity and have different affinities for the different classes of gluten. The measurement of gluten in processed products is further confounded by modifications to the proteins that occur during processing and in some case hydrolysis of the proteins. In this study, LC-MS/MS was used to profile whole beer, and two beer fractions representing hydrolysed hordeins (<30 kDa) and hordein peptide fragments (<10 kDa). Subsequently, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) MS enabled the relative quantification of selected peptide fragments in beer and revealed that certain classes of hordein were prone to hydrolysis (B- and D-hordein). Furthermore, select beers contained very high levels of gluten-derived fragments. Strikingly, those beers that contained high levels of B-hordein fragments gave near zero values by ELISA. The hydrolysed fragments that persist in beer show a dose-dependent suppression of ELISA measurement of gluten despite using a hordein standard for calibration of the assay. The development of MS-based methodology for absolute quantification of gluten is required for the accurate assessment of gluten, including hydrolysed forms, in food and beverages to support the industry, legislation and to protect consumers suffering from CD.",Journal of chromatography.

However, in beverages or food suffering complex hydrolytic processes as beers, the relative proportion of reactive peptides for celiac patients and the analytical techniques may differ, because of the diversity of the resulting peptide populations after fermentations. A beer below 20 parts per million of gluten but yet detectable levels of gluten peptides by anti-gliadin 33-mer antibodies (G12 and A1) was analyzed. We identified and characterized the relevant peptides for either antibody recognition or immunoactivity in celiac patients. The beer was fractionated by HPLC. The relative reactivity of the different HPLC fractions to the G12/A1 antibodies correlated to the reactivity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 14 celiac individuals. Peptides from representative fractions classified according to the relative reactivity to G12/A1 antibodies were identified by mass spectrometry. The beer peptides containing sequences with similarity to those of previously described G12 and A1 epitopes were synthesized and confirmed significant reactivity for the antibodies. The most reactive peptides for G12/A1 also confirmed the highest immunogenicity by peripheral blood mononuclear cell activation and interferon γ production from celiac patients.

Because of these features, LAESI-MSI may be the method of choice for spatially-resolved food analysis. In this work, LAESI time-of-flight MSI was investigated for macroscopic and microscopic imaging of pesticides, mycotoxins, and plant metabolites on rose leaves, orange and lemon fruit, ergot bodies, cherry tomatoes, and maize kernels. Accurate mass ion-map data were acquired at sampling locations with an x-y center-to-center distance of 0.2-1.0 mm and were superimposed onto co-registered optical images. The spatially-resolved ion maps of pesticides on rose leaves suggest co-application of registered and banned pesticides. Ion maps of the fungicide imazalil reveal that this compound is only localized on the peel of citrus fruit. However, according to three-dimensional LAESI-MSI the penetration depth of imazalil into the peel has significant local variation. Ion maps of different plant alkaloids on ergot bodies from rye reveal co-localization in accordance with expectations. The feasibility of using untargeted MSI for food analysis was revealed by ion maps of plant metabolites in cherry tomatoes and maize-kernel slices. For tomatoes, traveling-wave ion mobility (TWIM) was used to discriminate between different lycoperoside glycoalkaloid isomers; for maize quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) was successfully used to elucidate the structure of a localized unknown.

The aim of our study was to find key differences in the phytochemical profile of plasma after the consumption of 3 breads containing rye bran when compared with a plain white wheat bread control. Plasma metabolite profiles of 12 healthy middle-aged men and women were analyzed using LC quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis while fasting and at 60 min, 120 min, 240 min, and 24 h after consuming a meal that contained either 100% whole-grain sourdough rye bread or white wheat bread enriched with native unprocessed rye bran or bioprocessed rye bran. White wheat bread was used as the control. The meals were served in random order after a 12-h overnight fast, with at least 3 d between each occasion.

24717363,"Changes in serum metabolic profile after the intake of different food products (e.g., bread) can provide insight into their interaction with human metabolism. Postprandial metabolic responses were compared after the intake of refined wheat (RWB), whole-meal rye (WRB), and refined rye (RRB) breads. In addition, associations between the metabolic profile in fasting serum and the postprandial concentration of insulin in response to different breads were investigated. Nineteen postmenopausal women with normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance participated in a randomized, controlled, crossover meal study. The test breads, RWB (control), RRB, and WRB, providing 50 g of available carbohydrate, were each served as a single meal. The postprandial metabolic profile was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance and targeted LC-mass spectrometry and was compared between different breads using ANOVA and multivariate models. Eight amino acids had a significant treatment effect (P < 0.01) and a significant treatment × time effect (P < 0.05). RWB produced higher postprandial concentrations of leucine (geometric mean: 224; 95% CI: 196, 257) and isoleucine (mean ± SD: 111 ± 31.5) compared with RRB (geometric mean: 165; 95% CI: 147, 186; mean ± SD: 84.2 ± 22.9) and WRB (geometric mean: 190; 95% CI: 174, 207; mean ± SD: 95.8 ± 17.3) at 60 min respectively (P < 0.001). In addition, 2 metabolic subgroups were identified using multivariate models based on the association between fasting metabolic profile and the postprandial concentration of insulin. Women with higher fasting concentrations of leucine and isoleucine and lower fasting concentrations of sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines had higher insulin responses despite similar glucose concentration after all kinds of bread (cross-validated ANOVA, P = 0.048). High blood concentration of branched-chain amino acids, i.e., leucine and isoleucine, has been associated with the increased risk of diabetes, which suggests that additional consideration should be given to bread proteins in understanding the beneficial health effects of different kinds of breads. The present study suggests that the fasting metabolic profile can be used to characterize the postprandial insulin demand in individuals with normal glucose metabolism that can be used for establishing strategies for the stratification of individuals in personalized nutrition.

A total of 80 samples: barley, oat, rye, and wheat were collected and tested in the accredited laboratory. Among 180 pesticides, 10 active substances were detected. Banned pesticides, such as DDTs, γ-HCH, aldrin and diazinon were found in cereal grain. Chlorpyrifos methyl and pirimiphos methyl were the most frequently detected residues. No residues were found in 77.5% of the samples, 13.75% contained pesticide residues at or below MRLs, and 8.75% above MRLs. The greatest percentage of samples with residues (29%) was noted for wheat, and the lowest for rye (20%). Obtained data were used to estimate potential health risks associated with exposure to these pesticides. The highest estimated daily intakes (EDIs) were as follows: 789% of the ADI for aldrin (wheat) and 49.8% of the ADI for pirimiphos methyl (wheat and rye). The acute risk from aldrin and tebuconazole in wheat was 315.9% and 98.7% ARfD, respectively. The results show that despite the highest EDIs of pesticide residues in cereals, the current situation could not be considered a serious public health problem.

24259554,"Biomarkers of dietary intake are prominent tools in nutritional research. The alkylresorcinol metabolites 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5-DHBA) and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (3,5-DHPPA) have been proposed as exposure biomarkers of whole-grain (WG) wheat and rye intake. However, the profile of alkylresorcinol metabolites is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolism of alkylresorcinols in mice and in humans, while further determining urinary pharmacokinetics of the novel alkylresorcinol metabolites to explore their potential as biomarkers of WG wheat intake. Utilization of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach resulted in 10 alkylresorcinol metabolites identified in mice and in humans, including 3 phenolic acids and 7 of their phase II conjugates. Among them, 2 novel metabolites were discovered: 5-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)pentanoic acid (3,5-DHPPTA) and 2-(3,5-dihydroxybenzamido)acetic acid (3,5-DHBA glycine). The structures of these 2 metabolites were confirmed by comparing with authentic standards synthesized in-house. In the pharmacokinetic study, a group of 12 volunteers consumed a polyphenolic-restricted diet for 4 d before ingesting WG wheat bread containing 61 mg of alkylresorcinols. Urine samples were collected for 32 h, and alkylresorcinol metabolites were quantified with HPLC-coulometric electrode array detection. The mean urinary excretion rates and mean apparent half-life of 3,5-DHPPTA, 3,5-DHBA glycine, 3,5-DHBA, and 3,5-DHPPA at each time point were determined. Our results suggest that 3,5-DHPPTA and 3,5-DHBA glycine may be used in combination with 3,5-DHBA and 3,5-DHPPA as potential biomarkers to increase the accuracy of recording WG wheat and rye intake in epidemiologic studies. Further validation of 3,5-DHPPTA and 3,5-DHBA glycine as potential biomarkers is warranted.

A solid-phase extraction and cleanup method based on sodium-neutralized strong cation exchange (Na(+)-SCX) was developed to quantitate 12 priority ergot alkaloids in rye flour and wheat germ oil by HPLC fluorescence analysis. Sample preparation is achieved by omitting acidic and alkaline conditions enabling minimized epimerization, which is necessary to determine ergot alkaloids according to their natural distribution in foods. Ergot alkaloids are eluted from SCX-column by forming ion pairs using a sodium hexanesulfonate containing solution which prevents epimerization for at least 96 h. Method validation yielded recoveries of 80-120% (rye flour) and 71-96% (wheat germ oil) with a maximum limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 2.0 μg kg(-1) per ergot alkaloid for both matrices.

23946349,"Two phenolic acids, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and 3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)- propanoic acid (DHPPA), are the major metabolites of cereal alkylresorcinols (ARs). Like their precursors, AR metabolites have been suggested as biomarkers for intake of whole-grain wheat and rye and as such could aid the understanding of diet-disease associations. This study estimated and compared pharmacokinetic parameters of ARs and their metabolites in rats and investigated differences in metabolite formation after ingestion of different AR homologs. Rats were i.v. infused for 30 min with 2, 12, or 23 μmol/kg DHBA or DHPPA or orally given the same amounts of the AR homologs, C17:0 and C25:0. Repeated plasma samples, obtained from rats for 6 h (i.v.) or 36 h (oral), were simultaneously analyzed for ARs and their metabolites by GC-mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by population-based compartmental modeling and noncompartmental calculation. A 1-compartment model best described C25:0 pharmacokinetics, whereas C17:0 and AR metabolites best fitted 2-compartment models. Combined models for simultaneous prediction of AR and metabolite concentration were more complex, with less reliable estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters. Although the AUC of C17:0 was lower than that of C25:0 (P < 0.05), the total amount and composition of AR metabolites did not differ between rats given C17:0 or C25:0. The elimination half-life of ARs and their metabolites increased with length of the side chain (P-trend < 0.001) and ranged from 1.2 h (DHBA) to 8.8 h (C25:0).

Processing of whole cereal grains by the method produced representative test portions for the analysis of deoxynivalenol (DON). Method validation data, as well as the successful participation in various international proficiency tests, demonstrated the analytical method produced accurate and precise results. The evaluated method was used to monitor DON, 3- and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, nivalenol (NIV), T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol, and fusarenon-X in shipments of Canadian wheat, durum, barley, corn, rye, and oats transported between August 1, 2010, and July 31, 2012. DON was the most frequently measured trichothecene, found in 231 of the 303 samples at concentrations up to 2.34 mg/kg; NIV was the next most frequently observed trichothecene, but its occurrence was limited to barley. Concentrations of DON were significantly associated with wheat class and grade. The median DON concentration in durum (0.09 mg/kg) was lower than that for hard red spring (0.21 mg/kg). Lower grades of wheat also contained higher median concentrations of DON than higher grades, supporting the current use of Fusarium damaged kernels as a grading factor to manage DON.

This technology combines a unique microarray, prepared by covalent immobilization of target analytes or derivatives on diamino-poly(ethylene glycol) functionalized glass slides, with a dedicated chemiluminescence readout by a CCD camera. In a first stage, we aimed for the parallel detection of aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, and fumonisins in cereal samples in a competitive indirect immunoassay format. The method combines sample extraction with methanol/water (80:20, v/v), extract filtration and dilution, and immunodetection using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibodies. The total analysis time, including extraction, extract dilution, measurement, and surface regeneration, was 19 min. The prepared microarray chip was reusable for at least 50 times. Oat extract revealed itself as a representative sample matrix for preparation of mycotoxin standards and determination of different types of cereals such as oat, wheat, rye, and maize polenta at relevant concentrations according to the European Commission regulation. The recovery rates of fortified samples in different matrices, with 55-80 and 58-79%, were lower for the better water-soluble fumonisin B1 and deoxynivalenol and with 127-132 and 82-120% higher for the more unpolar aflatoxins and ochratoxin A, respectively.

23606126,"Fusarium mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) can occur in cereals conjugated to glucose and probably also to other sugars. These conjugates, which are often referred to as ""masked mycotoxins"", will not be detected with routine analytical techniques. Furthermore, it is suspected that the parent toxin may again be released after hydrolysis in the digestive tracts of animals and humans. Today, our knowledge of the occurrence of these compounds in cereal grains is limited. In this paper, a LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of DON, deoxynivalenol-3-β-D-glucoside (DON-3-glucoside), 3 acetyl-DON, nivalenol, fusarenon-X, diacetoxyscirpenol, HT-2 toxin, and T-2 toxin in naturally (n = 48) and artificially (n = 30) contaminated cereal grains (wheat, barley, oat, rye triticale) is reported. The method has also been applied to whole fresh maize plant intended for production of maize silage (n = 10). The samples were collected from the harvest years 2006-2010, The results show that DON-3-glucoside and DON co-occurred in cereal grains and, especially in several of the highly contaminated samples, the concentration of the glucoside can be relatively high, corresponding to over 37 % of the DON concentration. The DON-3-glucoside levels in both the naturally and in the artificially grain inoculated with Fusarium were second only to DON, and were generally higher than those of the other tested trichothecenes, which were found at low concentrations in most samples, in many cases even below the detection limit of the method. This argues for the importance of taking DON-3-glucoside into account in the ongoing discussion within the European Community concerning exposure re-evaluations for setting changed values for the tolerable intake for DON. Our results indicate that, in the naturally contaminated grains and in the Fusarium infested cereal grains (winter and spring wheat, oat, triticale), the concentration level of DON-3-glucoside is positively correlated to the DON content. When the DON concentration is high, then the content of DON-3-glucoside will most probably also be high and vice versa.",Mycotoxin research,"['D018554', 'D002853', 'D003718', 'D002523', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D005670', 'D005960', 'D001467', 'D013058', 'D012434', 'D014255', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Avena', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Denmark', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fusarium', 'Glucosides', 'Hordeum', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Secale', 'Trichothecenes', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Occurrence of different trichothecenes and deoxynivalenol-3-β-D-glucoside in naturally and artificially contaminated Danish cereal grains and whole maize plants.,"['Q000382', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000032', 'Q000382', 'Q000737']","['microbiology', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'microbiology', None, 'microbiology', 'analysis', 'microbiology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23606126,2013

23596967,"A multicompartmental nontargeted LC-MS metabolomics approach was used to study the metabolic responses on plasma and urine of hypercholesterolemic pigs after consumption of diets with contrasting dietary fiber composition (whole grain rye with added rye bran versus refined wheat). To study the metabolic responses, we performed a supervised multivariate data analyses used for pattern recognition, which revealed marked effects of the diets on both plasma and urine metabolic profiles. Diverse pools of metabolites were responsible for the discrimination between the diets. Elevated levels of phenolic compounds and dicarboxylic acids were detected in urine of pigs after rye consumption compared to refined wheat. Furthermore, consumption of rye was characterized by lower levels of linoleic acid derived oxylipins and cholesterol in the plasma metabolic profiles. These results indicate that higher consumption of nonrefined dietary fiber is reflected in higher excretion of phenolic compounds and dicarboxylic acids in urine and lower levels of linoleic acid derived oxylipins and cholesterol in plasma, which can be linked to beneficial health effects of rye components. On the other hand, pro-inflammatory lipid mediators were detected in higher concentration after rye consumption compared to refined wheat, which is opposite to what would be expected. These may indicate that even though a positive lowering effect with respect to cholesterol and fatty acids was achieved, this effect of rye dietary fiber was not sufficient to prevent inflammation in pigs. Moreover, we performed an alignment of the metabolic profiles between the breads consumed by pigs, plasma, and urine with the purpose to follow the metabolic fate of the compounds and to identify their pathways. One metabolite was identified in all three compartments, 16 metabolites were similar between bread and plasma, 3 were similar between plasma and urine, and 2 were similar between bread and urine.

Baking cookies resulted in degradation of EAs (2-30 %) and a shift in the epimeric ratio toward the (S)-epimer for all EAs. The applied digestion model led to a selective toxification of ergotamine and ergosine, two ergotamine-type EAs.

22794797,"This article describes a substantially improved multi-residue method for the determination of a large number of pesticides in cereal samples (wheat, rye, barley, oats, maze, buckwheat etc.) and various animal feeds. The sample preparation method and the GC-MS/MS acquisition method were modified to accommodate new complex cereal and feed matrices and to extend the existing analytical scope to 167 pesticides. The co-extractives were reduced by the joint use of primary secondary amine (PSA) and octadecyl (C18), 75 mg and 50 mg/1 mL of acetonitrile extract, in the presence of MgSO(4), and thus the optimal recovery and analytical selectivity were obtained simultaneously. The new cleanup procedure was faster and easier to handle than our previously applied cleanup procedure. The overall recoveries of the pesticides from buckwheat and rye at the three spiking levels of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.25 mg kg(-1) were 96 ± 9% with relative standard deviations of 10 ± 4% on average. At the lowest spiking level of 0.01 mg kg(-1), 137 of 167 pesticide residues (82%) fulfilled the validation criteria with recoveries in the range of 70-120% and RSDs less or equal 20% whereas in the previous approach it was 93 out of 140 analytes (66%). The developed method was implemented in a routine analysis of approximately 900 real samples, providing an increased scope of the analysis, improved analytical performance parameters and improved ruggedness versus the previous approach. A total of 17% analyzed samples contained pesticide residues.

For this purpose, an efficient molecular distillation procedure was developed for the extraction of analytes, and α-T3-spiked and thermally oxidized natural lipids (lard and wheat germ oil) and α-T3-rich foods (wholemeal rye bread and oil from dried brewer's spent grain) were investigated through HPLC-DAD-F. The following α-T3 oxidation products were extractable from lipid matrices along with tocochromanols: α-tocotrienolquinone (α-T3Q), α-tocotrienolquinone-4a,5-epoxide (α-T3Q-4a,5-E), α-tocotrienolquinone-7,8-epoxide (α-T3Q-7,8-E), 7-formyl-β-tocotrienol (7-FβT3), and 5-formyl-γ-tocotrienol (5-FγT3).

The (15)N(3)-labeled enniatins and beauvericin were biosynthesized by feeding two Fusarium strains Na(15)NO(3) and subsequently isolated from the fungal culture. The chemical structures of the biosynthesized products were characterized by LC-MS/MS and (1)H NMR. Standard solutions of (15)N(3)-labeled beauvericin, enniatin A, and enniatin A1 were accurately quantitated by quantitative NMR. On the basis of the use of the labeled products as internal standards, stable isotope dilution assays were developed and applied to various food samples using LC-MS/MS. The sample extracts were directly injected without any tedious cleanup procedures. The limits of detection were 3.9, 2.6, 3.7, 1.9, and 4.4 μg/kg for enniatins A, A1, B, and B1 and beauvericin, respectively.

22560244,"Fine and ultrafine metallic particulate matters (PMs) are emitted from metallurgic activities in peri-urban zones into the atmosphere and can be deposited in terrestrial ecosystems. The foliar transfer of metals and metalloids and their fate in plant leaves remain unclear, although this way of penetration may be a major contributor to the transfer of metals into plants. This study focused on the foliar uptake of various metals and metalloids from enriched PM (Cu, Zn, Cd, Sn, Sb, As, and especially lead (Pb)) resulting from the emissions of a battery-recycling factory. Metal and metalloid foliar uptake by various vegetable species, exhibiting different morphologies, use (food or fodder) and life-cycle (lettuce, parsley and rye-grass) were studied. The mechanisms involved in foliar metal transfer from atmospheric particulate matter fallout, using lead (Pb) as a model element was also investigated. Several complementary techniques (micro-X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry) were used to investigate the localization and the speciation of lead in their edible parts, i.e. leaves. The results showed lead-enriched PM on the surface of plant leaves. Biogeochemical transformations occurred on the leaf surfaces with the formation of lead secondary species (PbCO(3) and organic Pb). Some compounds were internalized in their primary form (PbSO(4)) underneath an organic layer.

22530555,"This research focuses on the overall extraction process of alkylresorcinols (ARs) from uncooked grains and baked products that have been processed with wheat, corn, rice, and white flour. Previously established extraction methods developed by Ross and colleagues, as well as a semiautomated method involving accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), were applied to extract ARs within freshly ground samples. For extraction of alkylresorcinols, nonpolar solvents such as ethyl acetate have been recommended for the extraction of uncooked foods, and polar solvents such as 1-propanol:water (3:1 v/v) have been recommended for the extraction of baked foods that contain rye, wheat, or other starch-rich grains. A comparison of AR extraction methods has been investigated with the application of gas chromatography and a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) to quantify the AR content. The goal of this research was to compare the rapid accelerated solvent extraction of the alkylresorcinols (ASE-AR) method to the previous manual AR extraction methods. Results for this study as well as the investigation of the overall efficiency of ASE-AR extraction with the use of a spiking study indicated that it can be comparable to current extraction methods but with less time required.

On an average, the rye starch granules were larger than those of wheat starch. The former had very comparable gelatinisation temperatures and enthalpies, but slightly lower gelatinisation temperatures than wheat starch. Under standardised conditions, they retrograded to a lesser extent than wheat starch. The lower gelatinisation temperatures and tendencies of the rye starches to retrograde originated probably from their higher levels of short amylopectin (AP) chains [degree of polymerisation (DP) 6-12] and their lower levels of longer chains (DP 13-24) than observed for wheat starch. The rapid visco analysis differences in peak and end viscosities between the rye starches as well as between rye and wheat starches were at least partly attributable to differences in the levels of AP short chains and in average amylose molecular weight.

Bread was enzymatically digested in vitro without and with the addition of Bifidobacterium bifidum KD6 (inoculum 10(6) CFU/cm(3)) and percentages of minerals released were determined. The concentration of minerals released during enzymatic digestion varied depending upon the element, quantity of bran, and presence of bacteria. Increase in bran content decreased release of elements. Bifidobacterium bifidum KD6 enhanced amounts of magnesium and zinc released from all types of bread, while manganese and copper rose only from white bread with 15% bran addition.

This paper examines the matrix effect of glyphosate liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (LC/ESI-MS) analysis in wheat and rye. The matrix effect (ionization suppression) was found to be dependent on sample particle size taken for the extraction. If samples are ground to very small particles severe ionization suppression occurs. For lower glyphosate contents (<1 mg/kg) the signal may even be suppressed by more than 90%. The matrix effect was found to be dependent on the matrix - rye showed significantly stronger ionization suppression than wheat, although these matrices are not very different. The matrix effect also depends on the concentration of glyphosate in the post-extraction spiked samples. It is demonstrated that the isotope-labelled standard (13)C(2)-glyphosate undergoes different ionization suppression than glyphosate and is therefore not efficient in compensating for matrix effect.

Samples were extracted with a mixture of acetonitrile/water (84:16, v/v) and cleaned up through a polymeric solid-phase extraction column. Detection and quantification of the nine mycotoxins were performed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS), using fully (13)C-isotope-labelled mycotoxins as internal standards. The method was validated in-house for five different cereal processed products, namely barley, oat and durum wheat flours, rye- and wheat-based crisp bread. Recoveries and repeatability of the whole analytical procedure were evaluated at contamination levels encompassing the EU maximum permitted levels for each tested mycotoxin. Recoveries ranged from 89 to 108% for deoxynivalenol, from 73 to 114% for aflatoxins, from 85 to 114% for T-2 and HT-2 toxins, from 64 to 97% for zearalenone, from 74 to 102% for ochratoxin A.

21329430,"Owing to its extensive use in the human diet, wheat is among the most common causes of food-related allergies and intolerances. Allergies to wheat are provoked by ingestion, inhalation or contact with either the soluble or the insoluble gluten proteins in wheat. Gluten proteins, and particularly the gliadin fraction, are also the main factor triggering celiac disease, a common enteropathy induced by ingestion of wheat gluten proteins and related prolamins from oat, rye and barley in genetically susceptible individuals. The role of gliadin and of its derived peptides in eliciting the adverse reactions in celiac disease are still far from being completely explained. Owing to its unique pathogenesis, celiac disease is widely investigated as a model immunogenetic disorder. The structural characterization of the injuring agents, the gluten proteins, assumes a particular significance in order to deepen the understanding of the events that trigger this and similar diseases at the molecular level. Recent developments in proteomics have provided an important contribution to the understanding of several basic aspects of wheat protein-related diseases. These include: the identification of gluten fractions and derived peptides involved in wheat allergy and intolerance, including celiac disease, and the elucidation of their mechanism of toxicity; the development and validation of sensitive and specific methods for detecting trace amounts of gluten proteins in gluten-free foods for intolerant patients; and the formulation of completely new substitute foods and ingredients to replace the gluten-based ones. In this article, the main aspects of current and prospective applications of mass spectrometry and proteomic technologies to the structural characterization of gluten proteins and derived peptides are critically presented, with a focus on issues related to their detection, identification and quantification, which are relevant to the biochemical, immunological and toxicological aspects of wheat intolerance.",Expert review of proteomics,"['D000485', 'D002446', 'D005903', 'D005983', 'D006801', 'D055315', 'D040901', 'D014908', 'D021182']","['Allergens', 'Celiac Disease', 'Gliadin', 'Glutens', 'Humans', 'Prolamins', 'Proteomics', 'Triticum', 'Wheat Hypersensitivity']",Proteomic analysis in allergy and intolerance to wheat products.,"['Q000145', 'Q000175', 'Q000009', 'Q000009', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000009', 'Q000175']","['classification', 'diagnosis', 'adverse effects', 'adverse effects', None, 'analysis', None, 'adverse effects', 'diagnosis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21329430,2011

20627948,"The effects of 50 microM cadmium (Cd) or copper (Cu) ions on the supramolecular conformation of the light-harvesting pigment-protein complex of PSII (LHCII) isolated from rye seedlings were studied. It was found that the action of these two metal ions on the LHCII structure and organization is dissimilar. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements indicated inhibition or stimulation of formation of parallel beta-structures and aggregates in the presence of Cd or Cu ions, respectively. The Chl a fluorescence excitation spectra of LHCII extracted from Cd-treated plants showed that the decreased aggregation of complexes was correlated with a decline in efficiency of quenching of excitation energy. From the results of mass spectrometry, changes in LHCII aggregation in the presence of Cd ions might be based on decreases in the molecular mass of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 proteins. An increase in the content of LHCII aggregates under Cu ion excess was associated with changes in the LHCII xanthophyll pigment pool. In the complexes isolated from Cu-treated plants, all-trans violaxanthin and 9'-cis neoxanthin content declined and the simultaneous appearance of the fraction of 9-cis violaxanthin was observed. 9-cis violaxanthin formation under Cu ion excess might facilitate LHCII inter-trimer interaction and, therefore, aggregation of complexes. RLS (resonance light scattering) spectra indicated that the excitonic interaction between Chl molecules and between Chls and xanthophylls was responsible for the effective dissipation of excitation energy in LHCII isolated from Cu-treated plants.

20560983,"Currently the only treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet excluding food products containing wheat, rye and barley. There is, however, only scarce evidence as to harmful effects of rye in coeliac disease. To confirm the assumption that rye should be excluded from the coeliac patient's diet, we now sought to establish whether rye secalin activates toxic reactions in vitro in intestinal epithelial cell models as extensively as wheat gliadin. Further, we investigated the efficacy of germinating cereal enzymes from oat, wheat and barley to hydrolyse secalin into short fragments and whether secalin-induced harmful effects can be reduced by such pretreatment. In the current study, secalin elicited toxic reactions in intestinal Caco-2 epithelial cells similarly to gliadin: it induced epithelial cell layer permeability, tight junctional protein occludin and ZO-1 distortion and actin reorganization. In high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS), germinating barley enzymes provided the most efficient degradation of secalin and gliadin peptides and was thus selected for further in vitro analysis. After germinating barley enzyme pretreatment, all toxic reactions induced by secalin were ameliorated. We conclude that germinating enzymes from barley are particularly efficient in the degradation of rye secalin. In future, these enzymes might be utilized as a novel medical treatment for coeliac disease or in food processing in order to develop high-quality coeliac-safe food products.",Clinical and experimental immunology,"['D018554', 'D018938', 'D002446', 'D002462', 'D003599', 'D002523', 'D017097', 'D018525', 'D005903', 'D005983', 'D001467', 'D006801', 'D007413', 'D008565', 'D062793', 'D010434', 'D010446', 'D010447', 'D010539', 'D010750', 'D012434', 'D019108', 'D014908', 'D014357', 'D062826']","['Avena', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Edible Grain', 'Electric Impedance', 'Germination', 'Gliadin', 'Glutens', 'Hordeum', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Occludin', 'Pepsin A', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Permeability', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Secale', 'Tight Junctions', 'Triticum', 'Trypsin', 'Zonula Occludens-1 Protein']",Degradation of coeliac disease-inducing rye secalin by germinating cereal enzymes: diminishing toxic effects in intestinal epithelial cells.,"['Q000201', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000276', 'Q000276', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000166', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', None]","['enzymology', None, 'immunology', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'enzymology', None, None, 'immunology', 'immunology', 'enzymology', None, 'cytology', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20560983,2010

The steryl ferulates were analyzed using HPLC. The genotype and growing location significantly affected the content and composition of wheat steryl ferulates, whereas the year of growth did not result in considerable variation. Less variation was observed in rye, due to fewer genotypes. Campestanyl and sitostanyl ferulates were the main species in both cereals.

This manuscript describes and validates an alternative approach based on normal-phase liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry for the quantification of alkylresorcinols in human plasma. The method requires neither SPE nor chemical derivatization and has a shortened run time compared to GC/MS. Normal- and reversed-phase columns and various mobile phases were evaluated with and without previous SPE of the samples. Normal-phase chromatography allowed separation of AR from the interfering triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and sterols and enabled detection of AR even without SPE of the samples. The described method has instrumental lower limits of detection in the 25-75 pg range, and lower limits of quantification in the 75-250 pg range. Pooled human plasma and (2)H(4)-nonadecylresorcinol (internal standard) was applied to calibrate the method in the 20-12 000 nM range. The overall method showed intra-batch precision of 8.6% and an averaged accuracy of 100.2%. Applications for diverse human plasma samples are presented and are compared with the results determined by GC/MS.

Analyses of broad ranges of foods point to cereal based foods being important sources of betaine and choline, however to date there has been no detailed analysis of these compounds in cereal flours or cereal products. An analytical method based on optimization of an existing extraction followed by LC-MS/MS analysis was used to analyze 47 plasma samples, 32 cereal flours and cereal fractions, and 51 cereal products. For the method validation LLOQ, recovery, inter- and intraday repeatability were all performed. Whole-grain wheat and rye flours, and products based on these were the best whole cereal sources of betaine (747-1508 microg/g) and to a lesser extent choline (76-159 microg/g), while the bran fraction contained the highest concentrations of betaine and free-choline (2350-2899 microg/g and 366-384 microg/g respectively). Refined wheat flour and products contained lower concentrations, while rice and maize contained only very low and no detectable amounts of betaine respectively (0-10 microg/g), and low amounts of free-choline (<31 microg/g). These results were mirrored in cereal products analyzed, with whole-grain wheat or rye-based cereal products having the highest concentrations of the two metabolites. Plasma concentrations for betaine and free-choline in a group of 47 subjects ranged from 15.2-66.3 and 9.8-18.5 micromol/L respectively, within the range of previous reports.

A significant reason for the inconsistent evidence could be methodological problems regarding accurate assessment of whole-grain intake.

Our aim was to overcome the methodological problems in previous questionnaire-based studies, by using AR as exposure measurement when studying the incidence of endometrial cancer. ARs were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in stored plasma samples from 177 endometrial cancer cases and a subcohort of 152 women, all originating from the same prospective cohort study. Incidence of endometrial cancer according to plasma levels of AR was estimated in a Cox regression model. No associations between plasma levels of AR and endometrial cancer were observed. Body mass index or use of hormone replacement therapy of the participants did not modify the association.

19733738,"Liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry--LC/ESI/MS--a primary tool for analysis of low volatility compounds in difficult matrices--suffers from the matrix effects in the ESI ionization. It is well known that matrix effects can be reduced by sample dilution. However, the efficiency of simple sample dilution is often limited, in particular by the limit of detection of the method, and can strongly vary from sample to sample. In this study matrix effect is investigated as the function of dilution. It is demonstrated that in some cases dilution can eliminate matrix effect, but often it is just reduced. Based on these findings we propose a new quantitation method based on consecutive dilutions of the sample and extrapolation of the analyte content to the infinite dilution, i.e. to matrix-free solution. The method was validated for LC/ESI/MS analysis of five pesticides (methomyl, thiabendazole, aldicarb, imazalil, methiocarb) in five matrices (tomato, cucumber, apple, rye and garlic) at two concentration levels (0.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1)). Agreement between the analyzed and spiked concentrations was found for all samples. It was demonstrated that in terms of accuracy of the obtained results the proposed extrapolative dilution approach works distinctly better than simple sample dilution. The main use of this approach is envisaged for (a) method development/validation to determine the extent of matrix effects and the ways of overcoming them and (b) as a second step of analysis in the case of samples having analyte contents near the maximum residue limits (MRL).",Analytica chimica acta,[],[],Combating matrix effects in LC/ESI/MS: the extrapolative dilution approach.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733738,2009

Satisfactory recoveries were obtained (70-110%) and precision (expressed as relative standard deviation) was typically below 15% with very few exceptions. Quantification of samples was carried out with matrix-matched standards calibration.

Oat (Avena sativa) seed extracts exhibited a high degree of antifungal activity and could be used directly on rye bread to prevent the formation of P. roqueforti colonies. Proteins in the oat seed extracts were fractionated by column chromatography and proteins in fractions containing antifungal activity were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and database searches. Identified antifungal candidates included thaumatin-like proteins, 1,3-beta-glucanase, permatin precursor, pathogenesis-related protein type 1, and chitinases of class I and II. Class I chitinase could be specifically removed from the extracts and was found to be indispensable for 50% of the P. roqueforti inhibiting activity. The purified class I chitinase has a molecular weight of approximately 34 kDa, optimal chitinase activity at pH 7, and exists as at least two basic isoforms (pI values of 7.6 and 8.0). Partial sequencing of the class I chitinase isoforms by LC-MS/MS revealed a primary structure with high similarity to class I chitinases of wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and rye (Secale cereale). Oat, wheat, barley, and rye seed extracts were compared with respect to the abundance of the class I chitinase and decrease in antifungal activity when class I chitinase is removed.

The 6 ergot alkaloids studied have been defined by the European Food Safety Authority as those that are the most common and physiologically active. The purity of the standards was investigated by means of liquid chromatography with diode array detection, electrospray ionization, and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-TOF-MS). All of the standards assessed showed purity levels considerably above 98% apart from ergocristinine (94%), ergosine (96%), and ergosinine (95%). Also discussed is the optimization of extraction conditions presented in a recently published method for the quantitation of ergot alkaloids in food samples using solid-phase extraction with primary secondary amine (PSA) before LC/MS/MS. Based on the results obtained from these optimization studies, a mixture of acetonitrile with ammonium carbonate buffer was used as extraction solvent, as recoveries for all analyzed ergot alkaloids were significantly higher than those with the other solvents. Different sample-solvent ratios and extraction times showed just minor influences in extraction efficacy. Finally, the stability of the ergot alkaloids in both raw cereals and cereal-based processed food extracts was studied. According to these studies, extracts should be prepared and analyzed the same day or stored below ambient temperatures. Barley and rye extracts, which were stored at 4 and 15 degrees C after PSA cleanup, proved to be stable overnight. However, storage over a period of 14 days at 4 degrees C resulted in significant epimerization, which was most pronounced in rye and particularly for ergocornine, ergocryptine, and ergocristine.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002523', 'D004876', 'D005506', 'D001467', 'D007202', 'D007536', 'D010936', 'D012015', 'D012434', 'D012997']","['Edible Grain', 'Ergot Alkaloids', 'Food Contamination', 'Hordeum', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Isomerism', 'Plant Extracts', 'Reference Standards', 'Secale', 'Solvents']",Determination of ergot alkaloids: purity and stability assessment of standards and optimization of extraction conditions for cereal samples.,"['Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19202797,2009
19025885,"Erythrocyte alkylresorcinols (5-alkyl-1,3-dihydroxybenzenes) are potential biomarkers of wholegrain wheat and rye intake. However, their high-throughput quantitative analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is hindered by the time-consuming sample preparation and, more importantly, by interfering compounds that still remain after sample cleanup. In the present work we describe a gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) method for the rapid and reliable quantification of alkylresorcinols in erythrocyte samples. The performance of the GC/MS/MS method is compared with that of GC/MS. The main characteristics of the method are: lower limits of detection: 2-10 microg/L standard solution; lower limits of quantification: 6-30 microg/L standard solution; linearity coefficients: 0.9611-0.9888; linear ranges: 2-20 microg/L in erythrocytes; and intra-day precisions (n = 6): 4-13% at endogenous analyte levels in non-spiked erythrocytes. Tandem mass spectrometry showed greatly improved selectivity over single-stage mass spectrometry in the case of erythrocyte samples, eliminating all interferences detectable in single-stage MS and enabling simple peak integration for quantification. Moreover, increased selectivity resulted in GC separation speeded up by a factor of two, allowing the duplicate analysis of over 40 samples per day. This GC/MS/MS method is suggested as an improved alternative to GC/MS for the quantification of alkylresorcinols in erythrocytes for assessing wholegrain wheat and rye intake.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D015415', 'D002849', 'D004435', 'D004912', 'D006801', 'D011237', 'D015203', 'D012118', 'D012434', 'D021241', 'D053719', 'D014908']","['Biomarkers', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Eating', 'Erythrocytes', 'Humans', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Resorcinols', 'Secale', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triticum']",Gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis of alkylresorcinols in red blood cells.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None]","['analysis', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19025885,2009

People with celiac disease (CD) must avoid wheat, rye, and barley proteins and products that contain them. These proteins are capable of initiating damage to the absorptive lining of the small intestine in CD patients, apparently as a consequence of undesirable interactions with the innate and adaptive immune systems. In this study, starch surface-associated proteins were extracted from four commercial wheat starches, fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis, and identified by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. More than 150 proteins were identified, many of which (for example, histones, purothionins, and glutenins) had not been recognized previously as starch-associated. The commercial starches were analyzed by the R-5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method to estimate the amount of harmful gluten protein present. One of these starches had a low gluten content of 7 ppm and actually fell within the range proposed as a new Codex Alimentarius Standard for naturally gluten-free foods (maximum 20 ppm).

18348046,"Mycotoxin analysis is usually carried out by high performance liquid chromatography after immunoaffinity column cleanup or in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. These methods normally involve determination of single compounds only. EU legislation already exists for the aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and patulin in food, and legislation will come into force for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and the fumonisins in 2007. To enforce the various legal limits, it would be preferable to determine all mycotoxins by routine analysis in different types of matrices in one single extract. This would also be advantageous for HACCP control purposes. For this reason, a multi-method was developed with which 33 mycotoxins in various products could be analysed simultaneously. The mycotoxins were extracted with an acetonitrile/water mixture, diluted with water and then directly injected into a LC-MS/MS system. The mycotoxins were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and detected using an electrospray ionisation interface (ESI) and tandem MS, using MRM in the positive ion mode, to increase specificity for quality control. The following mycotoxins could be analysed in a single 30-min run: Aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, alpha-zearalenol, alpha-zearalanol, beta-zearalanol, sterigmatocystin, cyclopiazonic acid, penicillic acid, fumonisins B1, B2 and B3, diacetoxyscirpenol, 3- and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, zearalanone, ergotamin, ergocornin, ergocristin, alpha-ergocryptin, citrinin, roquefortin C, fusarenone X, nivalenol, mycophenolic acid, alternariol and alternariol monomethyl ether. The limit of quantification for the aflatoxins and ochratoxin A was 1.0 microg kg(-1) and for deoxynivalenol 50 microg kg(-1). The quantification limits for the other mycotoxins were in the range 10-200 microg kg(-1). The matrix effect and validation data are presented for between 13 and 24 mycotoxins in peanuts, pistachios, wheat, maize, cornflakes, raisins and figs. The method has been compared with the official EU method for the determination of aflatoxins in food and relevant FAPAS rounds. The multi-mycotoxin method has been proven by the detection of more than one mycotoxin in maize, buckwheat, figs and nuts. The LC-MS/MS technique has also been applied to baby food, which is subject to lower limits for aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A, ergot alkaloids in naturally contaminated rye and freeze-dried silage samples.","Food additives & contaminants.

The comparison of the 2-DE profiles of 16 doubled haploid lines, with or without the 1BL.1RS translocation, revealed quantitative and qualitative proteic variations in prolamins and other endosperm proteins. Eight spots were found specifically in lines having the 1BL.1RS translocation; 16 other spots disappeared from the same lines. Twelve spots, present in both genotypes, met the criteria for up- or down-regulated spots. In translocated genotypes, a highly overexpressed spot, identified as a gamma-gliadin with nine cysteine residues, suggests that the lack of LMW-GS induced by 1BL.1RS is counterbalanced by an overexpression of a relatively similar prolamin.

The method comprised acid hydrolysis and lipid extraction followed by alkaline saponification, prior to analysis by HPLC. In addition, the fatty acid profile of the foods was determined via total lipid extraction, fatty acid derivitisation and GC analysis. In general, beta-sitosterol was the most prevalent phytosterol, ranging in concentration from 24.9 mg/100 g in pumpkin seed to 191.4 mg/100 g in peas. Squalene identified in all foods examined in this study, was particularly abundant in pumpkin seed (89.0 mg/100 g). The sum of alpha- and beta+ gamma-tocopherols ranged from 0.1 mg/100 g in rye to 15.9 mg/100 g in pumpkin seeds.

It could be demonstrated that acrylamide content in bread strongly depends on the cultivar, with extremes differing by a factor of 5.4 due to marked differences in free asparagine and crude protein contents. Nitrogen fertilization also resulted in elevated amino acid and protein contents, thus increasing acrylamide levels from 10.6 to 55.6 mug/kg. Independent of fertilization, harvest year turned out to be another factor influencing acrylamide formation. Breads produced from 2003 flours showed significantly higher acrylamide contents than those of 2004, which was ascribed to favorable light and temperature conditions during the cultivation period, thus enhancing amino acid and protein contents. Sprouting of the grain also resulted in significantly higher acrylamide levels, which was attributed to elevated enzyme activities and the formation of precursors from protein and starch.

16212427,"Dietary gluten proteins from wheat, rye, and barley are the primary triggers for the immuno-pathogenesis of Celiac Sprue, a widespread immune disease of the small intestine. Recent molecular and structural analyses of representative gluten proteins, most notably alpha- and gamma-gliadin proteins from wheat, have improved our understanding of these pathogenic mechanisms. In particular, based on the properties of a 33-mer peptide, generated from alpha-gliadin under physiological conditions, a link between digestive resistance and inflammatory character of gluten has been proposed. Here, we report three lines of investigation in support of this hypothesis. First, biochemical and immunological analysis of deletion mutants of alpha-2 gliadin confirmed that the DQ2 restricted T cell response to the alpha-2 gliadin are directed toward the epitopes clustered within the 33-mer. Second, proteolytic analysis of a representative gamma-gliadin led to the identification of another multivalent 26-mer peptide that was also resistant to further gastric, pancreatic and intestinal brush border degradation, and was a good substrate of human transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Analogous to the 33-mer, the synthetic 26-mer peptide displayed markedly enhanced T cell antigenicity compared to monovalent control peptides. Finally, in silico analysis of the gluten proteome led to the identification of at least 60 putative peptides that share the common characteristics of the 33-mer and the 26-mer peptides. Together, these results highlight the pivotal role of physiologically generated, proteolytically stable, TG2-reactive, multivalent peptides in the immune response to dietary gluten in Celiac Sprue patients. Prolyl endopeptidase treatment was shown to abolish the antigenicity of both the 33-mer and the 26-mer peptides, and was also predicted to have comparable effects on other proline-rich putatively immunotoxic peptides identified from other polypeptides within the gluten proteome.",Journal of proteome research,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D002446', 'D002853', 'D019992', 'D004305', 'D000939', 'D019204', 'D017353', 'D005903', 'D005983', 'D001467', 'D006801', 'D007249', 'D013058', 'D008871', 'D008969', 'D016296', 'D009154', 'D010455', 'D010940', 'D000085822', 'D000091345', 'D011506', 'D040901', 'D051381', 'D011994', 'D012434', 'D012697', 'D013601', 'D011503', 'D014908']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Databases as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epitopes', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gliadin', 'Glutens', 'Hordeum', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microvilli', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Peptides', 'Plant Proteins', 'Prolyl Oligopeptidases', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Secale', 'Serine Endopeptidases', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transglutaminases', 'Triticum']",Identification and analysis of multivalent proteolytically resistant peptides from gluten: implications for celiac sprue.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000166', 'Q000737', 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'cytology', 'chemistry', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16212427,2006

15977033,"In the present study, selenium-enriched plant biomass was investigated to evaluate the ability of rye seedlings to take up, and assimilate, inorganic selenium. Two different analytical approaches were used. Electrophoretic separation (SDS-PAGE) of proteins extracted from 75Se-labelled biomass was used to investigate the biotransformation of selenite into organic forms of the element. Ion-pair chromatography coupled with ICP-MS detection was chosen for the analysis of selenium species, enzymatically extracted from the plant biomass. The results of three enzymatic hydrolysis procedures and three sequential enzymatic extractions procedures are compared. The most effective single extraction was proteolysis (using protease type XIV), giving an overall extraction efficiency of 48%. However, for combinations of enzymes, the most effective was cellulase (Trichoderma viride) followed by sequential extraction of the solid pellet using protease type XIV, giving an extraction efficiency of 70%. The complementary data from the electrophoretic fractionation of proteins, and the HPLC separation of Se-species in the proteolytic digests, reveal the existence of large number of selenium-containing compounds in the rye seedling plant biomass. The results showed the complete biotransformation of inorganic selenium into organic forms during germination of the rye seedlings. HPLC-ICP-MS analysis of extracts from the plant biomass did not show the presence of selenate or selenite. At the time of this study, the lack of suitable organic-MS facilities meant that it was not possible to characterise them fully.

15969508,"To monitor chemical reactions between ferulate and proteins during breadmaking, 8-(14)C-(E)-ferulic acid-(d-galactopyranose-6'-yl)ester was synthesized as a radiotracer and added to wheat and rye flour prior to breadmaking. Breads were lyophilized, extracted by means of a modified Osborne fractionation, and the radioactivity of the fractions was determined by scintillation analysis. The major portion of the radioactivity remained in the water-soluble fraction. However, a significant enrichment of the tracer was also detected in the prolamin and glutelin fractions in comparison to the control experiment. Separation of the prolamin fraction by RP-HPLC and scintillation measurement of the fractions gave evidence for a chemical modification of the tracer. To determine the structure of the reaction product, the prolamin fractions were completely hydrolyzed to free amino acids by means of an enzyme cocktail, and the digests were studied by LC-MS. In one fraction, a newly formed compound was detected. Comparison of its chromatographic and mass spectrometric behavior with a synthetic reference compound gave evidence that the newly identified compound was a dehydroferulic acid-tyrosine cross-link. It is likely that this cross-link represented a covalent linkage between arabinoxylans and cereal proteins.

In this report, the stability of DIBOA is studied in two soils from crop lands of wheat cv. Astron and cv. Ritmo. These varieties were selected by their concentrations of DIBOA and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-(2H)-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA) from aerial parts and by the bioactivities of their aqueous extracts in the growth of wheat coleoptile sections. The degradation rate of DIBOA in these soils was measured in laboratory tests during 90 h by high-pressure liquid chromatography methods. These analyses demonstrate that DIBOA was transformed primarily into 2-benzoxazolinone (BOA). This transformation was similar in both soil types with an average half-life of 43 h. The degradation studies for BOA show its biotransformation to 2-aminophenoxazin-3-one (APO) with a half-life of 2.5 days. Therefore, BOA is an intermediate product in the biotransformation from DIBOA to APO in these wheat crop soils and is consistent with previous findings.

They are formed by the conversion of dietary precursors such as secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol lignans by the colonic microflora. The identification of lignins, cell-wall polymers structurally related to lignans, as precursors of mammalian lignans is reported here for the first time. In study 1, rats were fed rye or wheat bran (15% diet) for 5 d. Untreated brans and brans extracted with solvents to remove lignans were compared. ENL was estimated in urine samples collected for 24 h by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. ENL urinary excretion was reduced from 18.6 to 5.3 nmol/d (n=8; P<0.001) when lignans were removed from rye bran and from 30.5 to 6.2 nmol/d (P<0.001) when they were removed from wheat bran. These results suggest that lignins, embedded in the cell wall and retained in the bran during solvent extraction, account for 26-32% of the ENL formed from cereal brans. In study 2, rats were fed a deuterated synthetic lignin (0.2% diet) together with wheat bran (15%) for 3 d.

Quantitative immunoassays for detecting the related rye ergot alkaloid, ergotamine, are described in the literature, but those assays are relatively insensitive for DHES. This paper describes competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for measuring the DHES concentration in grains and mixed animal feed. The assays were developed using a DHES specific mouse monoclonal antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against DHES conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Recoveries of between 77 and 103% were obtained from spiked grain using a simple, one step extraction with 70% methanol. Both the monoclonal and the polyclonal assays are capable of detecting DHES concentrations above 0.01 mg/kg, but quantification is most reliable at concentrations of 0.1 mg/kg or higher.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000821', 'D002851', 'D002967', 'D002523', 'D004797', 'D004879', 'D005506', 'D012680']","['Animal Feed', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Claviceps', 'Edible Grain', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Ergotamines', 'Food Contamination', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",Determination of dihydroergosine in sorghum ergot using an immunoassay.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12822923,2003
12797742,"An affinity-based purification procedure with the immobilized family 11 Bacillus subtilis endoxylanase XynA allowed us to obtain high yields of highly pure endoxylanase inhibitor fractions from rye, barley, and durum wheat. In contrast, no inhibitors interacting with the B. subtilis endoxylanase affinity column are present in corn, buckwheat, rice, and oats. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and inhibitor specificity showed that the isolated inhibitors belonged to the TAXI endoxylanase inhibitor family, thus providing a view on the diversity of this cereal inhibitor family. The isolated inhibitors are basic proteins of ca. 40 kDa, occurring in two molecular forms, with pI values of ca. 8.5 (durum wheat) and ca. 9.0 (rye, barley). They are, in general, strong inhibitors of family 11 endoxylanases but not of family 10 endoxylanases. Because cereal endogenous endoxylanases belong to the latter family, this probably indicates that they do not influence cereal metabolic processes. For the first time, endoxylanase inhibitors, similar to TAXI I and TAXI II from wheat, were isolated from durum wheat and characterized. For each cereal, high-resolution cation exchange chromatography revealed the presence of multiple isoinhibitors, each of which occurs in two molecular forms.

These foods were chosen for their relevance in human and animal nutrition and prepared as they are usually eaten by humans. As confirmed by further investigations the precaecal digestibility is a valuable measure for determining the availability of native B-vitamins. Therefore, pigs were fitted with an end-to-end ileo-rectal anastomosis for digesta passing straight from ileum to rectum, thus avoiding endogenous vitamin synthesis by the colon. Three weeks after surgery the digestibility experiments were carried out during which the animals were fed various experimental diets for a period of 12 days and digesta were collected quantitatively twice a day during the final 5 days of this period. The concentration of vitamin B6 in foods and chyme was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Precaecal digestibility of vitamin B6 from all tested food sources ranged from 51 to 91% in the following order: cabbage diet > banana diet > fish diet > milk powder diet > brewer's yeast diet > soybeans diet > soybean meal diet > egg diet/corn diet > barley diet > wheat bran diet > rye diet.

Rye wholemeals contained significantly higher concentrations of total and soluble dietary fiber (TDF and SDF, respectively), total and water-extractable arabinoxylan (TAX and WEAX, respectively), and beta-glucan than did wheat. Significant positive correlations were obtained between rye wholemeal extract viscosity and SDF content (r = 0.90, p < 0.05) and WEAX content (r = 0.89, p < 0.05). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of water extracts of rye wholemeals revealed the presence of a high molecular weight fraction (HMWF), which was found in higher concentration in the ryes than in wheat. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.84, p < 0.05) was observed between HMWF content (expressed as a proportion of the total carbohydrate in water extracts) and extract viscosity of rye wholemeals. Treatment of a rye wholemeal extract with xylanase, followed by GPC, indicated that the HMWF consisted primarily of WEAX. Successive treatment of a rye wholemeal extract with alpha-amylase, lichenase, protease, and xylanase confirmed that the viscosity of the extract was primarily related to its content of WEAX.

A fast method for identification of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties has previously been developed, which combines analysis of alcohol-soluble wheat proteins (gliadins) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry with neural networks. Here we have applied the same method for the identification of both barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.) varieties. For barley, 95% of the mass spectra were correctly classified. This is an encouraging result, since in earlier experiments only a grouping into subsets of varieties was possible.

11260160,"Patients with wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis experience severe allergic reactions when exercising after ingestion of wheat. The major wheat allergen associated with these reactions is a omega-5 gliadin, and patients following a gluten-free diet have remained free of symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine whether allergens cross-reacting with wheat omega-5 gliadin are present in rye, barley and oats. Sera from 23 adult patients with wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis were examined. Cereal allergens cross-reacting with wheat omega-5 gliadin were identified by immunoblot inhibition. The cross-reactive allergens were purified by gel filtration and reversed-phase chromatography and submitted to amino acid sequencing. Cross-reactivity was further studied by IgE ELISA and ELISA inhibition, and in vivo reactivity by skin prick testing. In immunoblotting rabbit anti-omega-5 gliadin antibodies bound to 70 kDa and 32 kDa proteins in rye and a 34-kDa protein in barley, but not to proteins in oats. N-terminal sequencing identified these proteins as rye gamma-70 secalin, rye gamma- 35 secalin and barley gamma-3 hordein, correspondingly. In ELISA 21/23 (91%) patients with wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis showed IgE antibodies to purified gamma-70 secalin, 19/23 (83%) to gamma-35 secalin and 21/23 (91%) to gamma-3 hordein. In ELISA inhibition omega-5 gliadin inhibited over 90% of the IgE binding of pooled patient sera to solid-phase gamma-secalins and gamma-3 hordein. Skin prick testing gave positive reactions to gamma-70 secalin in 10/15 (67%) patients, to gamma-35 secalin in 3/15 (20%) patients and to gamma-3 hordein in 7/15 (47%) patients. The results of this study show that gamma-70 and gamma-35 secalins in rye and gamma-3 hordein in barley cross-react with omega-5 gliadin, a major allergen in wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis.

Nutrient digestibilities for the total digestive tract and at various sites of small intestine were measured during the period from day 18 to 20 of age and at day 21 of age, respectively, using a marker technique. Jejunal and ileal supernatant viscosity increased in an exponential manner as dietary pentosan concentration was increased. This increase was more pronounced in tallow fed birds but was also found in enzyme treated groups albeit at a much lower level. Xylanase activity was still detectable in the ileum of birds fed enzyme supplemented diets but its activity was found to decrease as dietary pentosan content increased. Digestibility of crude protein and that of some amino acids at the terminal ileum was decreased as dietary pentosan content was increased and significantly improved by xylanase addition. No fat effect and no interactions were detected at this site. In contrast, measurements made over the whole gastrointestinal tract showed significantly lower protein and amino acid digestibility values for tallow fed birds, and significant higher enzyme effects especially in diets with higher pentosan concentrations.

The method was extended to include mepiquat in the present study. Quantitation was done by the internal standards method, using mass chromatograms of the most intense daughter ions of mepiquat (m/z 98), chlormequat (m/z 58), and [13C]-chlormequat (m/z 61, internal standard).

The 30-kD protein had an isoelectric point of 9.3 or higher. A sequence of 19 amino acids at the NH2 terminus showed 84.2% identity with an internal sequence of 15-kD grain-softness protein, friabilin. High-performance anion-exchange chromatography and gel-permeation analysis of the hydrolysis products indicated the preferential hydrolysis of highly branched structures by the enzyme; wheat arabinoxylan and rye (Secale cereale) arabinoxylan (high arabinose to xylose ratios) were hydrolyzed more efficiently by this enzyme than oat (Avena sativa) spelt xylan (low arabinose to xylose ratios). The release of the hydrolysis products as a function of time suggested that the endoxylanolytic activity was associated with the release of arabinose units from the polysaccharides, suggesting that the enzyme action is similar to that by endoxylanases from Ceratocystis paradoxa, Aspergillus niger, and Neurospora crassa. Although the enzyme released arabinose from arabinoxylan, it did not hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside. From the above, it follows that the enzyme, called arabinoxylanase, differs from most microbial endoxylanases and from an endoxylanase purified earlier from wheat flour.",Plant physiology,"['D000595', 'D018554', 'D002850', 'D002852', 'D005433', 'D005658', 'D007700', 'D008969', 'D008970', 'D010446', 'D010940', 'D012434', 'D017386', 'D013379', 'D014908', 'D014990', 'D014995']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Avena', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Flour', 'Fungi', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Plant Proteins', 'Secale', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Triticum', 'Xylans', 'Xylosidases']",Identification and characterization of a novel arabinoxylanase from wheat flour.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000201', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000201', 'Q000378', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'enzymology', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'enzymology', 'metabolism', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9414565,1998

These components were characterized by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, immunoblotting using a coeliac serum and microsequencing analysis. This allowed the identification of a group of secalins with different molecular masses according to their N-terminal amino-acid sequence: one omega-type secalin of 40 kDa (omega 1-40); three gamma-type secalins, one of 70 kDa (gamma-70) and two of 35 kDa (gamma-35); as well as two low molecular mass glycoproteins of 15 and 18 kDa, all exhibiting coeliac serum antigenicity. Moreover, four additional rye components, including two low molecular mass proteins, which did not react with coeliac sera, have also been identified.

The 1BL/1RS wheat-rye chromosomal translocation derived from the Russian cultivars 'Kavkaz' and 'Aurora' has been among the most common means of accessing useful rye genes. Unfortunately, deleterious wheat quality effects are often associated with the presence of 1RS. The identification of genetic backgrounds capable of alleviating the deleterious effects of 1RS is crucial for its continued exploitation. End-use quality parameters and flour protein composition, as measured by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) of 373 wheat lines, derived from seven 1BL/1RS breeding populations, were analyzed. In all populations, significant quality defects were detected in 1BL/1RS lines compared to non-1RS sister lines. The detrimental quality effects resulted from alteration of the ratio of flour protein composition, especially, decreased glutenin concentrations, and increased salt-water soluble protein concentrations. The end-use quality of 1BL/1RS lines, however, was highly dependent on genetic backgrounds. The potential exists for improvement in quality through crosses between 1RS lines with high glutenin, or low salt-water soluble protein concentrations, and non-1RS lines with strong dough properties.

Current methods of analysis for DON and related trichothecene mycotoxins involve gas chromatography with electron capture detection, thin-layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Improved sensitivity and selectivity for DON, as well as for the related compounds nivalenol and fusarenon-X, are made possible by the use of high-performance liquid chromatography with online, postcolumn photolysis and oxidative amperometric detection (HPLC-hv-EC). Conditions are optimized with respect to residence time in the photolytic reactor, applied potentials, mobile phase pH, and chromatographic parameters for the separation of DON, nivalenol, and fusarenon-X, and the technique is found to be linear over a range of 10 ppb-2 ppm with minimum detection limits on the order of 1-2 ng on-column (10-20 ppb). Since these compounds are not electroactive in the absence of photolysis, an additional mode of specificity is realized in addition to the chromatographic retention time and the dual-electrode response ratio.

Mean levels between 0.33 mg/kg and 0.27 mg/kg DON could be detected in barley, rye and oat. Of the wheat samples, 58% contained ZEA with a maximum of 1.560 mg/kg. The highest levels of ZEA were detected in samples which also showed high concentrations of DON. The NIV and T-2 toxin levels were comparatively low. Thirty percent of the samples showed NIV concentrations between 0.04 mg/kg and 0.29 mg/kg and 38% contained between 0.005 and 0.60 mg/kg of T-2.

After extraction and preliminary cleanup chromatography with n-hexane or chloroform, the mycotoxins ochratoxin A, citrinin, penicillic acid, sterigmatocystin, and zearalenone were easily separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using toluene-ethyl acetate-90% formic acid (6 + 3 + 1) developing solvent. In chemical confirmatory methods, the developed chromatogram was exposed to vapors of pyridine, acetic anhydride, or a mixture, or the mycotoxins were over-spotted. With this treatment, ochratoxin A, citrinin, penicillic acid, and zearalenone were converted to new fluorescent compounds, and observed under 365 nm light after re-chromatography with the same developing solvent. Sterigmatocystin was confirmed chemically using TLC plates impregnated with 0.6N H2SO4 or 10% oxalic acid in methanol.

Using the ELISA method, three coeliac sera with elevated antibody titres against gliadins and two control sera with low titres were tested for IgG antibodies against the main groups of wheat proteins (acetic acid soluble glutenins, salt soluble albumins and globulins and alcohol soluble gliadins), eight fractions of gliadin and the alcohol soluble proteins of barley, rye, oat, maize and rice. As rice contained little alcohol soluble protein, a test against acid soluble rice proteins was included. In all three patient sera, titres higher than or equal to that for crude gliadin were found for wheat glutenin and for gliadin fractions seven and eight, both containing alpha gliadins. Similar high titres were found when these coeliac sera were tested against rye, barley and oat prolamines. Maize prolamines gave only low titres and no antibodies could be detected against rice proteins, in line with the tolerance of these latter two cereals by patients with coeliac disease. It would appear that sera from coeliac patients react with more than one antigenic fraction of protein in wheat and other cereals.

7219518,"By means of atomic absorption spectrometry, the authors determined the cadmium, zinc, copper and manganese contents in potatoes and cereals from three territories differently burdened by heavy-metal immissions (rural region, overcrowded urban region, region with non-ferrous metal industry). Of these elements, cadmium was most enriched, followed (by a wide margin) by zinc and copper, whereas the manganese level was slightly higher in the burdened region II (compared to the burdened region I) and somewhat lower in the burdened region III. Compared to normal values (0.035--0.080 p.p.m.), i. e., values found in non-burdened regions, the cadmium contents were some 2- to 6-fold higher in air-dry samples of wheat, barley and rye from the burdened regions, some 30-fold higher in oats, and some 3- to 4-fold higher in potatoes (normal values, on a dry-weight basis, (0.140 p.p.m.). As to cereals, the zinc levels were, at the most, some 2-fold higher than the normal values (29--34 p.p.m.), the copper contents were, at the most, some 1.5-fold higher than the normal values (4.1 bis 4.8 p.p.m.), whereas the manganese levels (normal values, 14--30 p.p.m.) were less by half. In potatoes, the zinc contents were but slightly higher than the normal values (18.5 p.p.m., on a dry-weight basis), the copper levels (4.6 p.p.m., on a dry-weight basis) were some 2-fold higher, and the manganese contents (7.2 p.p.m., on a dry-weight basis) were somewhat reduced. On an average 26% (region with non-ferrous metal industry) or 13% (normal region) of the heavy metals are removable from potatoes by washing. On the basis of the results obtained and of data from the literature, an estimate is calculated for the expected values in territories differently burdened by heavy-metal immissions.

575906,"An outbreak of mortality in a flock of mutton merino sheep in which 109 out of 568 sheep died in the south-western Cape Province, is described. It was characterized by haemorrhagic septicaemia, anaemia, leucocytopaenia and haemorrhagic tendencies. Mortalities followed unseasonal and heavy summer rain, extended over a period of 6 months and were associated with the uninterrupted consumption of sheep cubes processed on the farm severly fungus-infested wheat, barley and rye straw for a period of at least one month. The main clinical signs occurred in two phases: an elevated body temperature, listlessness, epistaxis and intermittent haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first phase of the outbreak, and a progressively worsening anaemia, leucocytopaenia and less severe haemorrhagic tendencies and a terminally elevated body temperature during the second phase. The predominant autopsy findings were purpuric haemorrhage on serosal and mucosal surfaces and in most of the organs, enterorrhagia and severe pulmonary congestion and oedema during the first stage; anaemia was the predominant sign during the second stage - widespread haemorrhage still occurred but was less extensive. Pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from most of the animals autopsied during the first stage. Histologically the most salient features were atrophy and necrosis of the lymphoid tissue, aplastic anaemia and a markedly impaired inflammatory response. Extensive post-natal lamb mortalities, probably due to an Escherichia coli infection precipitated by the toxicosis, occurred during the outbreak. Toxigenic strains of Stachybotrys chartarum were isolated from the wheat and barley straw. Diethyl ether extracts of the wheat straw, sheep cubes and S. chartarum culture material elicited positive skin tests in rats following intradermal injection and the presence of 12,13-epoxytrichothecenes in these extracts were confirmed by thin layer chromatography. In feeding trials sheep cubes and wheat straw caused the death of 4/4 one-day-old Pekin ducklings and weanling Wistar rats in six and nine days, respectively.
