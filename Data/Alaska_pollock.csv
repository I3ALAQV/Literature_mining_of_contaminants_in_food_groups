20546388,"Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) is the U.S.A.'s largest commercial fishery, with an annual catch of over 1 million tons. During pollock processing, the skins are discarded or made into fish meal, despite their value for gelatin production. The absence of gelatin-processing facilities in Alaska necessitates drying of the skins before transport to decrease the moisture content, but conventional hot-air drying is expensive. This study evaluated a less energy-intensive technology, the use of desiccants for reducing water weight in pollock skins prior to shipment. To ensure that the functional properties of gelatin obtained from dried pollock skins were not affected during desiccation, gelatins were prepared from each skin-drying treatment and compared with gelatin extracted from air-dried pollock skins. None of the desiccation treatments decreased the gel strength of pollock skin gelatin, nor were there major differences in gelling temperature or viscosity among the gelatin solutions. This suggests that pollock skins can be economically stabilized for transport to a gelatin-processing facility through the use of regenerable desiccants that are already common in the food industry.",Journal of food science,"['D000596', 'D000818', 'D003890', 'D055119', 'D005511', 'D005524', 'D048388', 'D005780', 'D005782', 'D006863', 'D007220', 'D008970', 'D011786', 'D012867', 'D013053', 'D013718', 'D044366', 'D014783', 'D014867']","['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Desiccation', 'Elastic Modulus', 'Food Handling', 'Food Technology', 'Gadiformes', 'Gelatin', 'Gels', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Industrial Waste', 'Molecular Weight', 'Quality Control', 'Skin', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Tensile Strength', 'Transition Temperature', 'Viscosity', 'Water']",Dehydration of pollock skin prior to gelatin production.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'methods', None, 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20546388,2010
17995718,"Recombinant chum salmon cystatin (RC) expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified by His-select nickel affinity chromatography. The specific inhibitory activities of RC against papain and cathepsin L were 7.45 and 10.24 U/mg, respectively. RC was stable over pH 5.0 to 7.0 and at temperature below 65 degrees C. RC was used to prevent the gel weakening of Alaska pollock surimi. RC at 100 microg/g showed the highest inhibitory activity against the autolysis of surimi based on the analysis of TCA-soluble peptides. As the concentration of RC increased, both the breaking force and deformation of modori gel greatly increased (P < 0.05). The addition of RC resulted in less expressible drip, which coincided with the increase of whiteness. More myosin heavy chain (MHC) was retained as the addition of RC increased. Therefore, RC could prevent the degradation of proteins in Alaska pollock surimi and was better than egg white (EW). Thus, RC could be applied to Alaska pollock surimi to prevent gel weakening and RC at 100 microg/g was the optimal concentration.",Journal of food science,"['D000818', 'D002403', 'D002846', 'D015891', 'D015853', 'D004305', 'D005396', 'D005511', 'D005782', 'D006863', 'D010206', 'D011994', 'D012441', 'D013696']","['Animals', 'Cathepsins', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cystatins', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fish Products', 'Food Handling', 'Gels', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Papain', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Temperature']",Application of recombinant chum salmon cystatin to Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) surimi to prevent gel weakening.,"[None, 'Q000037', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000037', 'Q000494', None, None]","[None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', None, None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'pharmacology', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17995718,2007
