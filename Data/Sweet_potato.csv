35347716,"Fermentation of eight vegetables was studied as an alternative for reclamation of surplus volumes. Fermentation performance was predicted by comparing the amounts of acid that could be produced from the intrinsic sugar content with that buffered by the fresh vegetable matrices prior to reaching an inhibitory pH for fermentative microbes (3.30). Native fermentations were brined with 345.0 mM sodium chloride, 40.0 mM calcium chloride, 6.0 mM potassium sorbate, and vinegar to adjust the initial pH to 4.70. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis, pH, and carbon dioxide measurements and spiral plating on selective media were employed to monitor the progress of fermentations. The average colony counts for yeast and/or molds and Enterobacteriaceae declined to undetectable levels from 3.6 ± 1.5 log CFU/ml within 7 days of fermentation. The fermentation of sugars produced lactic, acetic, succinic, and/or malic acids, and ethanol. As predicted, the fermentation of vegetables with low sugar content, such as broccoli, green leaf lettuce, and green pea proceeded to completion. The fermentation of vegetables with a moderate sugar content, such as green bell pepper, red ripened tomato, and green bean were incomplete at pH 3.1 ± 0.2. The fermentation of high sugar vegetables including sweet potato and corn were expected and observed to be incomplete. It is concluded that the intrinsic sugar content and buffer capacity of surplus vegetables are relevant parameters in obtaining complete fermentations. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Vegetables are the second most wasted commodity in the United States and a substantial constituent of the global food waste. Development of fermentation to reclaim surplus vegetables from farms, grocery stores, and farmer's markets offers opportunities to ameliorate economic losses and environmental impact and add value to waste. The research described here suggests that a fraction of vegetables could be fermented in cover brines while others, with high sugar content, need specialized handling. Evidently, optimization of vegetable fermentation with starter cultures and added buffers represent an opportunity to stimulate complete bioconversions useful for reclaiming surplus volumes.",Journal of food science,[],[],Vegetable fermentations brined with low salt for reclaiming food waste.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35347716,2022
34677020,"Starch occurs naturally in the form of semicrystalline granules, and is composed of two types of carbohydrate molecules, amylose (AM) and amylopectin (AP). Starch granules and starch molecules have sizes in the range of 1-100 μm and 20-250 nm, respectively; these size ranges are among the key factors affecting the functional properties of starch. Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) is a size-based separation technique. The major difference between AF4 and dynamic light scattering or microscopy techniques is that AF4 enables the separation of particles based on their size; consequently, the elution profile can be converted to the size distribution of the samples. In the last two decades, AF4 systems, when coupled online with multiangle light scattering (MALS) and differential refractive index (dRI) detectors (AF4-MALS-dRI), have demonstrated to be applicable for the size characterization of starch at the molecular level. Unlike size exclusion chromatography (SEC), AF4 systems use an open channel that does not require a stationary phase or packing materials. Thus, the shear scission of AP molecules during AF4 separation is minimized. The size detection range of a commercial AF4 system ranges from 1 nm to 10 μm, which is smaller than the size range of starch granules. In this study, a home-made AF4 system was developed, and its capability for the size characterization of starch granules extracted from sweet potato, lotus seed, and rice was investigated. The performance of the developed AF4 system was evaluated by running a mixture of polystyrene (PS) with diameter of 2, 6, 12, and 20 μm, respectively. Baseline separation of four PS samples was achieved, and the resolution for 6 μm PS and 12 μm PS was 1.40. The detection limit of the developed AF4 system was higher than that of commercial AF4 systems. Thus, the developed AF4 system is promising for the separation and characterization of starch granules. The effect of the composition of the carrier liquid on the AF4 separation of starch granules was also studied. Moreover, the accuracy of AF4 in terms of size characterization of the starch granules was evaluated by optical microscopy (OM). The results revealed that the type of dispersant and viscosity of the carrier liquid affect the accuracy of size characterization of the starch granules. The size distribution of rice starch granules obtained using a carrier liquid containing 0.01% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (used as a dispersant), 0.02% (w/v) NaN",Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,"['D000688', 'D031521', 'D008970', 'D012031', 'D013213']","['Amylose', 'Fractionation, Field Flow', 'Molecular Weight', 'Refractometry', 'Starch']",[Development of an asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation system for the size characterization of starch granules].,"[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34677020,2021
34641353,"Volatile compounds are the main chemical species determining the characteristic aroma of food. A procedure based on headspace solid-phase microextraction (HP-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed to investigate the volatile compounds of sweet potato. The experimental conditions (fiber coating, incubation temperature and time, extraction time) were optimized for the extraction of volatile compounds from sweet potato. The samples incubated at 80 °C for 30 min and extracted at 80 °C by the fiber with a divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) coating for 30 min gave the most effective extraction of the analytes. The optimized method was applied to study the volatile profile of four sweet potato cultivars (Anna, Jieshu95-16, Ayamursaki, and Shuangzai) with different aroma. In total, 68 compounds were identified and the dominants were aldehydes, followed by alcohols, ketones, and terpenes. Significant differences were observed among the volatile profile of four cultivars. Furthermore, each cultivar was characterized by different compounds with typical flavor. The results substantiated that the optimized HS-SPME GC-MS method could provide an efficient and convenient approach to study the flavor characteristics of sweet potato. This is the basis for studying the key aroma-active compounds and selecting odor-rich accessions, which will help in the targeted improvement of sweet potato flavor in breeding.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D008401', 'D027723', 'D009812', 'D052617', 'D013649', 'D013696', 'D055549']","['Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Ipomoea batatas', 'Odorants', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Taste', 'Temperature', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Optimization of HS-SPME for GC-MS Analysis and Its Application in Characterization of Volatile Compounds in Sweet Potato.,"['Q000379', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032']","['methods', 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641353,2021
34287964,"In this study, anthocyanins were extracted and purified from purple sweet potato anthocyanins (PSPA) and the alleviative effect of PSPA on doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity was investigated. High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) results showed that 10 kinds of substances were identified in PSPA and the PSPA was mainly composed of cyanidin (62.9%) and peonidin (21.46%). In in vitro experiments, PSPA reduced the excessive release of inflammatory factors (NO and TNF-α) induced by DOX and decreased the secretion of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) caused by myocardial injury. In in vivo experiments, PSPA inhibited the release of NO and MDA levels in heart tissue. Meanwhile, mice treated with PSPA decreased the levels of LDH, CK, TNF-α, and TMAO in serum and heart tissue when compared with the DOX group. In addition, the histopathological results of the heart tissue also showed a protective effect of PSPA on the pathological changes in heart. These results provide a reference for the application of PSPA as a functional food to intervene in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The effects of anthocyanins from purple sweet potato anthocyanins (PSPA) on doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity were investigated in vitro and in vivo.

33431342,"Sweet potato shochu oil is one of the by-products of sweet potato shochu production. We investigated the functionality and industrial use of shochu oil as a food-derived raw material. Because of the increased incidence of self-consciousness in people owing to thinning hair, in this study, we examined the hair growth-inducing effects of shochu oil. Minoxidil, the only topical medication approved for hair growth treatment in Japan, was used as a control for the evaluation of hair growth-promoting activity of shochu oil. Human follicle dermal papilla cells treated with shochu oil showed upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that shochu oil induced the activation of the hair growth cycle. In vivo, epidermal treatment with shochu oil also promoted hair growth in C3H mice. More than 35 components were detected in shochu oil via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The main components, accounting for 98.5% of shochu oil, were as follows, in order of decreasing concentration: ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl oleate, ethyl stearate, ethyl caprate, ethyl laurate, ethyl myristate, and ethyl α-linolenate. Among these, ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate, and ethyl α-linolenate promoted hair growth in C3H mice. These results indicate that shochu oil can be used as a hair restorer.

Four laboratories, 1 principal laboratory and 3 collaborating laboratories, conducted instrument comparison (limit of detection [LOD], limit of quantification [LOQ], and linear dynamic range [LDR] on 24 data sets), in-house method comparison (accuracy and precision on 120 data sets), and interlaboratory comparison (reproducibility on 528 data sets using Horwitz equation analysis). Matrices tested included 2 types of pet food jerky treats (chicken and sweet potato), bovine blood, and bovine liver and kidney. The instrument comparison study confirmed that ICP-MS provided the sensitivity necessary for the analysis of all heavy metals tested at concentrations below the level of concern for routine diagnostic testing.

Carotenoids were identified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) while the folate was estimated using a microbial assay. An obvious decline was observed in total carotenoids after heating. Nevertheless, the content of provitamin compound β-carotene exhibited incredible stability during steaming and α-carotene multiplied in certain varieties, evidencing that SPRs could be an efficient way for addressing Vitamin A deficiency (VAD). As for the total folate contents, two varieties were found no significant loss after thermal process while the others showed a significant decrease. The results indicated that steaming process led to generally loss of both carotenoids and folate while the α-carotene and β-carotene were well preserved.

By using LC-MS analysis, 12 types of anthocyanins were found in the purple sweet potato alcoholic beverage (PSPFAB); these were based on cyanidin and peonidin as aglycones. The anthocyanins in young PSPFAB mainly consisted of acylates. The acylated anthocyanins, however, degraded gradually with aging. Cyanidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside and peonidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside were found to be major anthocyanins in the PSPFAB after two years of aging. Moreover, 52 kinds of volatile components were detected in PSPFAB by GC-MS analysis. Alcohol and ester substances constituted a major proportion of these volatile components of PSPFAB. After two years of aging, levels of high-alcohols such as 1-pentanol remarkably decreased to below the detection limit, while the level of total esters increased significantly.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether polyphenol oxidase (PPO), an important eggplant enzyme, acts as an allergen. The proteins of eggplant peel extract were separated on phenyl-Sepharose (PS), and analyzed by skin prick test (SPT), ELISA and IgE-immunoblotting; the components were analyzed for PPO activity, presence of protein-bound copper, and recognition by rabbit polyclonal anti-sweet potato PPO antiserum. LC-MS/MS and in silico analysis were employed to identify the separated allergens and prediction of IgE epitopes. Eggplant allergens were separated into 5 components (PS1-PS5), of which component PS2 exhibited high specific PPO activity. SPT and ELISA with PPO-rich pool (PS2) were positive in all 6 eggplant-allergic subjects; the 43, 64 and 71kDa proteins displayed strong IgE-binding ability. The 64 and 71kDa IgE-binding proteins show PPO activity, presence of copper, and recognition by anti-sweet potato PPO antiserum, clearly identifying them as PPOs; the 43kDa protein appears to be a degradation product of the 64 or 71kDa proteins based on enzymic activity and recognition by PPO antiserum. The 64kDa protein upon further resolution by SDS-PAGE displayed two components (identified as eggplant PPO1 and PPO4 by LC-MS/MS). Based on bioinformatics approaches, PPO4 has been identified as an allergen since it harbors an IgE epitope. This study clearly demonstrates that the 64 and 71kDa allergens in eggplant peel are PPOs based on enzymic activity and recognition by PPO antiserum; the 64kDa copper-containing protein is identified as one of the several eggplant allergens (Sola m PPO4).

24053411,"Native to tropical America, Ipomoea batatas has been cultivated for over 5000 years in Mexico. The yellow-skinned tuber crop variety, with an orange flesh, has a higher nutritional value than potato. Raw sweet potato can cause a purge due to its resin glycoside content. Purification of the chloroform-soluble resin glycosides from the roots of this variety was accomplished by preparative-scale HPLC, which allowed for the collection of six oligosaccharides, batatin VII (1) and batatinosides VII-IX (2-4), all of novel structure, together with the known resin glycosides pescaprein I and batatinoside IV. High-field NMR spectroscopy and FAB mass spectrometry were used to characterize each structure, identifying operculinic acid A for compounds 2 and 4, and simonic acid B for 3, as their pentasaccharide glycosidic cores.

23979675,"Sweet potatoes are a staple in the diet of some people and an excellent source of minerals. Metal monitoring in food, like sweet potatoes, provides basic information on safety aspects in regulatory processes as well as nutritional values. One hundred five samples of three varieties of sweet potatoes were randomly obtained from supermarkets, farmers markets, and farmers' plots in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). The edible portion (pulp) was the only part considered for analysis. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine the contents of sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn), while the levels of chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The mean concentrations were 500 Na, 4409 K, 564 Ca, 609 Mg, 1.291 Cu, 6.554 Fe, 2.324 Mn, 2.348 Zn, 0.028 Cr, 0.048 Ni, 0.001 Cd, and 0.003 Pb mg/kg, respectively. Potassium presented the highest contents in all varieties of sweet potatoes. Iron was the most abundant microelement. The orange fleshed sweet potato variety offered greater nutritional contributions to the recommended intakes than the rest of the varieties studied. The estimated mean daily intake of Ni (0.72 mg/day) detected in our samples was highly consistent with other studies. Average daily intakes of Cd (0.015 μg/day) and Pb (0.045 μg/day) were below toxicological reference values.

23870978,"This paper develops a rapid analysis method for adulteration identification of a popular traditional Chinese food, lotus root powder (LRP), by near-infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics. 85 pure LRP samples were collected from 7 main lotus producing areas of China to include most if not all of the significant variations likely to be encountered in unknown authentic materials. To evaluate the model specificity, 80 adulterated LRP samples prepared by blending pure LRP with different levels of four cheaper and commonly used starches were measured and predicted. For multivariate quality models, two class modeling methods, the traditional soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) and a recently proposed partial least squares class model (PLSCM) were used. Different data preprocessing techniques, including smoothing, taking derivative and standard normal variate (SNV) transformation were used to improve the classification performance. The results indicate that smoothing, taking second-order derivatives and SNV can improve the class models by enhancing signal-to-noise ratio, reducing baseline and background shifts. The most accurate and stable models were obtained with SNV spectra for both SIMCA (sensitivity 0.909 and specificity 0.938) and PLSCM (sensitivity 0.909 and specificity 0.925). Moreover, both SIMCA and PLSCM could detect LRP samples mixed with 5% (w/w) or more other cheaper starches, including cassava, sweet potato, potato and maize starches. Although it is difficult to perform an exhaustive collection of all pure LRP samples and possible adulterations, NIR spectrometry combined with class modeling techniques provides a reliable and effective method to detect most of the current LRP adulterations in Chinese market.

Among these, chlorogenic acids (CGAs) received considerable attention for their wide distribution and part of human diet with potential biological effects. CGAs (71 compounds), being esters of derivatives of cinnamic acids with quinic acid are widely distributed in plant materials. Coffee is among the highest found in plants, ranging from 4 to 14%. Besides, these are reported in plant foods such as apples, pears, carrot, tomato, sweet potato, Phyllostachys edulis, oilseeds, Prunus domestica L, cherries, and eggplant. The traditional Chinese medicinal plants such as flowers and buds of Lonicera japonica Thunb and the leaves of Eucommia ulmodies contained CGAs as bioactive compound. These play an important role in the formation of roasted coffee flavor and have a marked influence on coffee cup quality. CGAs are considered as main precursors of coffee flavor and pigments. Recent technological advancements in the separation and purification of CGAs such as molecular-imprinted polymer technique; microwave-assisted extraction; pH gradient counter current chromatography has also been described.

Evidence is mainly against all-E-beta-carotene, while there is no evidence against other carotenoids or against mixtures of beta-carotene stereoisomers. Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets.

17995676,"Phenolic acids in commercially important sweet potato cultivars grown in the United States were analyzed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid were well separated with an isocratic elution in less than 25 min compared to about 120 min for analyzing and re-equilibrating the column with a gradient method. The isocratic elution order of these caffeoylquinic acid derivatives was confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Chlorogenic acid was the highest in root tissues, while 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and/or 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid were predominant in the leaves. Steam cooking resulted in statistically nonsignificant increases in the concentration of total phenolics and all the individual phenolic acids identified.

16205940,"Simon extracts are vitamin K(1)-rich food materials extracted from the leaves of the Simon sweet potato. Although vitamin K is known to stimulate bone formation, we postulated that Simon extracts also contain unknown biological compounds having the ability to regulate bone resorption. Here we prepared the vitamin K-free fraction from the Simon extracts and investigated the ability of this fraction on the differentiation of osteoclasts. A remarkable inhibitory effect of osteoclastogenesis was observed when osteoclast precursors were treated with this fraction in rat bone marrow culture systems as well as in a pure differentiation system using murine osteoclast precursor cell line. The vitamin K-free Simon extracts markedly suppressed severe bone destruction mediated by abundant osteoclasts associated with adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that the vitamin K-free Simon extracts contained three types of low molecular weight inhibitors for osteoclastogenesis; caffeic acid, chlorogenic acids and isochlorogenic acids. Among these substances, caffeic acid showed the most powerful inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis. Caffeic acid significantly suppressed expression of NFATc1, a key transcription factor for the induction of osteoclastogenesis.

11758899,"A marked greening observed in some foods such as sweet potato, burdock, and others during food processing was shown to be due to green pigment formation by the condensation reaction of two molecules of chlorogenic acid or caffeic acid ester with one molecule of a primary amino compound under aeration in alkaline solution. Reduction of the green pigment by ascorbic acid or NaBH4 gave a yellow product, which readily turn green and then blue in air. The reduced and acetylated product of the green pigment was identified to be a novel trihydroxy benzacridine derivative, and the yellowish ethanol solution of this product immediately turned green upon addition of butyl amine or diluted alkali. Therefore, the green pigment was assumed to be an oxidized quinone type product of trihydroxy benzacridine. This identification of the structure was supported by the correspondence of the measured absorption spectra with those calculated by the molecular orbital method. A possible charge transfer complex between products of different oxidation steps in green solution was proposed.","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","['D000107', 'D000166', 'D002109', 'D002726', 'D002850', 'D003116', 'D004952', 'D005511', 'D009682', 'D010084', 'D010860', 'D013056', 'D014675']","['Acetylation', 'Acridines', 'Caffeic Acids', 'Chlorogenic Acid', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Color', 'Esters', 'Food Handling', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Pigments, Biological', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Vegetables']",Structure of green pigment formed by the reaction of caffeic acid esters (or chlorogenic acid) with a primary amino compound.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11758899,2002
11735447,"Cylindrical pieces of potato, sweet potato, kohlrabi, radish, and pear were interposed between a pair of electrodes, and a direct current was applied. A special custom-made apparatus enabled the use of differently shaped electrodes. The electrical field was applied for 1 min at 40 V/cm and caused a reduction in specimen weight by a minimal value of 2.7% of initial weight in sweet potato to a maximum 38.4% in pear. The affected area of the tissue resembled the shape of the electrode. Pores were produced in the tissue (from the anode side), possibly promoting slow release of minerals and other cell components from the contracted specimens. From the cathode side, cell ""sealing"" could be observed. Weight loss was dependent on the mechanical properties of the nontreated vegetative tissue specimens. After confirmation that all samples pass through induced electrical shrinkage, further work, executed only on potato, demonstrated that after electrical treatment the samples were less brown (higher L values). In addition, a dependence of weight loss on current intensity, electrode diameter, and surface ratio between the electrode and specimen was shown. The reduction in weight loss could be useful for initial drying of vegetative materials. Indirect proof of a decrease in enzyme activity as a result of electrical field application could be beneficial in replacing traditional methods for browning prevention.",Biotechnology progress,"['D004156', 'D055598', 'D002627', 'D003116', 'D004548', 'D004566', 'D004574', 'D005519', 'D005638', 'D008855', 'D008903', 'D013056', 'D014675']","['Catechol Oxidase', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Color', 'Elasticity', 'Electrodes', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Food Preservation', 'Fruit', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Minerals', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Vegetables']",Physicochemical properties and structural changes in vegetative tissues as affected by a direct current electrical field.,"['Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000033', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000033']","['analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'anatomy & histology', None, 'chemistry', None, 'anatomy & histology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11735447,2002

15739468,"Sweet potato root tissue, when infected with different pathogens, invaded by insects, or irritated by certain chemicals, turns black-brown and produces and accumulates a large amount of furanoterpenoids such as ipomeamarone, ipomeamaronol, ipomeanine and 4-ipomeanol, which are toxic to animals. The furanoterpenoids from sweet potato root tissues infected with Ceratocystis fimbriata were extracted with ether. The extract solution was washed with 5% Na2CO3 and followed with distilled water and dried with dehydrated sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). The resulting ether extract was evaporated and the residue (crude sample) was dissolved in a small volume of chloroform. The determination of furanoterpenoid toxins was made on the plates at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C respectively. The chloroform-soluble fraction was spotted on a silica gel G thin-layer plate and developed using different solvent systems, n-hexane and ethylacetate (4:1, V/V) , benzene and methanol (9:1, V/V) and petroleum ether and ethylacetate (2:1, V/V), until the solvent front migrated 10 cm from the starting spots. After development, Ehrlich's reagent was sprayed on the plate to detect the compounds. In the experiment, pure ipomeamarone and ipomeamaronol were used as standards. Thin-layer chromatograms on silica gel plates showed the furanoterpenoids were resolved effectively. The repeatability of Rf value was good. The resolution was the best in the solvent systems of benzene-methanol and petroleum ether-ethylacetate at 20 degrees C. After spraying Ehrlich's reagent, ipomeamarone (C) appeared as a light pink spot which soon changed to a dark gray, ipomeamaronol (A) as a purple red spot, compound B and D as a purple red and a gray spot respectively.
