35314979,"Carnosine is a naturally occurring dipeptide and a functional component in foods, while also showing health-promoting effects. Generally, food-derived carnosine is quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We have developed a method for quantifying carnosine in foods using microbial enzymes, β-Ala-Xaa dipeptidase (BapA) and histidine ammonia-lyase (HAL). The carnosine concentrations in extracts of chicken, pork, beef, bonito, and tuna were determined via both HPLC and enzymatic determination. The carnosine contents measured via enzymatic determination were in agreement with those determined via conventional HPLC analysis. Relative standard-deviation values of the conventional HPLC method and the enzymatic determination of carnosine in foods were 0.728-5.76% and 0.504-4.58%, respectively. The recovery of carnosine in food extracts via enzymatic determination was 97-103%. Therefore, the developed enzymatic determination technique using BapA and HAL can be used for the determination of carnosine in meats and fishes with comparable accuracy to that of conventional HPLC analysis.",Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002336', 'D002417', 'D004150', 'D005399', 'D006638', 'D008460', 'D016958']","['Animals', 'Carnosine', 'Cattle', 'Dipeptidases', 'Fishes', 'Histidine Ammonia-Lyase', 'Meat', 'Pseudomonas putida']",Enzymatic determination of carnosine in meat and fish using β-Ala-Xaa dipeptidase and histidine ammonia-lyase derived from Pseudomonas putida NBRC100650.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35314979,2022
34985214,"Chlorpropham is a plant growth regulator and a herbicide. It is commonly used in the post-harvest treatment of potato to inhibit germination. It can also be used for flower thinning and fruit thinning of fruit trees, and for controlling annual gramineous weeds and a few broad-leaved weeds. Improper or excessive use of chlorpropham in crop cultivation will affect the safety of animal-derived food and impair human health through the food chain and water cycle. Therefore, accurate quantification of chlorpropham is imperative for risk assessment and mitigating risks to food safety. A method based on solid phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS) was established for the determination of chlorpropham in animal-derived food. First, the pretreatment conditions were optimized. To purify the samples and remove impurities, SPE column cartridges with different packing materials such as PXC, PXA, Florisil, and PLS were investigated. Based on the retention of chlorpropham, the ProElut PLS SPE column was selected as the pretreatment purification column. The washing solution and eluents were then optimized. When water was used as the washing solution, chlorpropham remained adsorbed on the SPE column and was not eluted along with other water-soluble substances. When the proportion of acetonitrile exceeded 40%, chlorpropham adsorbed on the filler of the SPE column could be gradually washed down. Acetonitrile-water solution(30∶70, v/v) was used for washing the SPE column. The elution ability of seven eluents for chlorpropham on the SPE column was then investigated. Among them, pure methanol, pure acetonitrile, and 1% (v/v) formic acid-methanol showed better elution effect. Considering that acetonitrile was used in the sample extraction, it was chosen as the mobile phase eluent. Subsequently, the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters were optimized. By examining the ionization cracking of chlorpropham, the quasimolecular ions and corresponding fragmentations in the chlorpropham primary MS were determined. The separation effect of three C18 columns was investigated. Based on the retention ability and peak effect of chlorpropham on the column, the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) column was used for chlorpropham separation. The response of chlorpropham in the positive and negative ionization modes was investigated and optimized. The results showed that the response was better in the positive ion mode than that in the negative ion mode. After optimizing the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters, the sensitivity of the method was improved. Finally, the analytes were separated on the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) under a gradient elution program using acetonitrile and 0.2% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution as the mobile phases. The analytes were detected in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode under positive electrospray ionization (ESI",Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002748', 'D002851', 'D006801', 'D008892', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chlorpropham', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Milk', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",[Determination of chlorpropham residues in animal-derived foods by solid phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry].,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34985214,2022

In this study, mepiquat formation in meat (pork and beef) and vegetables (potatoes and broccoli) was investigated via HPLC-MS/MS; the investigated cooking methods were oven baking, pan cooking, deep frying, and microwaving. The results showed that, among all foods, oven-baked potatoes showed the highest mepiquat level of 1064 μg/kg, which appeared after 20 min at 240 °C. The residual rates of mepiquat precursors, pipecolic acid (PipAc), betaine, choline, and trigonelline, were determined in oven-baked potatoes to investigate their correlation with mepiquat formation. The PipAc levels reduced by 99.8% at 260 °C after 30 min of oven baking, exhibiting a significantly high decomposition rate.

34753973,"Nine odorless laboratory-collected hydro-distilled aqueous extracts (basil, calendula, centrifuged oregano, corn silk, laurel, oregano, rosemary, spearmint, thyme) and one industrial steam-distilled oregano hydrolate acquired as by-products of essential oils purification were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against three Salmonella Typhimurium strains (4/74, FS8, FS115) at 4 and 37 °C. Susceptibility to the extracts was mainly plant- and temperature-dependent, though strain dependent effects were also observed. Industrial oregano hydrolate eliminated strains immediately after inoculation, exhibiting the highest antimicrobial potential. Hydro-distilled extracts eliminated/reduced Salmonella levels during incubation at 4 °C. At 37 °C, oregano, centrifuged oregano, thyme, calendula and basil were bactericidal while spearmint, rosemary and corn silk bacteriostatic. A strain-dependent effect was observed for laurel. The individual or combined effect of marinades and edible coatings prepared of industrial hydrolate and hydro-distilled oregano extracts with or without oregano essential oil (OEO) was tested in pork meat at 4 °C inoculated with FS8 strain. Lower in situ activity was observed compared to in vitro assays. Marinades and edible coatings prepared of industrial oregano hydrolate + OEO were the most efficient in inhibiting pathogen. Marination in oregano extract and subsequent coating with either 50% oregano extract + OEO or water + OEO enhanced the performance of oregano extract.

TM concentrations in commercial pet foods (n = 100) as well as in ingredients used in their composition (n = 100) were analyzed and compared to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maximum tolerable level (MTL), and the TM concentrations found in the different sources of carbohydrate, protein, and fat were compared. The TM concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma with optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Concentrations above the MTL for aluminum, mercury, lead, uranium, and vanadium were observed in both dog and cat foods, and the percentage of dog foods that exceeded the MTL of these TM were: 31.9%; 100%; 80.55%; 95.83%; and 75%, respectively, and in cat foods: 10.71%; 100%; 32.14%; 85.71%; 28.57%, respectively. The MTL values of these TMs and the mean values in dog foods (mg/kg dry matter basis) (MTL [mean ± standard deviation]) were: aluminum: 200 (269.17 ± 393.74); mercury: 0.27 (2.51 ± 1.31); lead: 10 (12.55 ± 4.30); uranium: 10 (76.82 ± 28.09); vanadium: 1 (1.35 ± 0.69), while in cat foods were: aluminum: 200 (135.51 ± 143.95); mercury: 0.27 (3.47 ± 4.31); lead: 10 (9.13 ± 5.42); uranium: 10 (49.83 ± 29.18); vanadium: 1 (0.81 ± 0.77).

34677016,"As among the most widely used pesticides in agriculture, plant growth regulators (PGRs) have a positive influence on plants. However, the overuse of PGRs may induce toxicity in food and even be hazardous to human health. Numerous studies have investigated the presence and residues of PGRs on vegetables and fruits. Animal-derived foods are one of the most dominant food sources providing nutrients to fulfil the daily dietary intake, and could also be potentially contaminated by PGRs. However, there is little information on PGR residues in animal-derived foods. Standardization also lacks among the techniques for PGR determination in animal-derived foods, thereby restricting the further establishment of pesticide usage and food safety regulations. Therefore, in this study, a rapid and effective method for analyzing chlormequat chloride, thidiazuron, and paclobutrazol in animal-derived food samples was established.

Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was employed to detect PCP levels in these food matrices. PCP was found in all food categories, but the average contamination levels were low, ranging from 0.40 µg/kg wet weight (ww) (hen eggs) to 5.85 µg/kg ww (offals). However, higher concentrations of PCP were detected (P < 0.05) in animal source food from the North region. Additionally, a temporal declining trend was observed in this four-year consecutive survey. The estimated human dietary exposure of PCP to population groups, including the general population and subgroups (male and female, children, and adults), was found to be far below the permissible daily intake (3 µg/kg body weight).

32925990,"Microbiological purity control of food products is of great importance in the food industry. Contaminated food is often characterized by a deteriorated taste, smell, and appearance, and when consumed, it can pose a threat to human health and life. Also, contamination incurs huge financial losses to the food industry. Different methods are used for identification of the microorganisms isolated from food, which are based on phenotypic, immunologic, genetic, and spectroscopic techniques. Unfortunately, these methods have the following disadvantages: laborious, time-consuming, requiring a well-trained spectrometer operator with specialist knowledge, or very accurate, but complicated, and extremely expensive. In recent years, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been gaining increasing importance in the field of food microbiology. Unlike other techniques used for microorganisms identification, MALDI-TOF MS is more rapid, accurate and cost-efficient, and easy to perform.

32854180,"Game meat has been underutilized, while it offers the potential to diversify not only the human diet but also increase food production and the nutritional value of meat products. This study aimed to determine the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of the digested game meats (venison and boar meat) compared with those of livestock meats (beef and pork). Through the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size chromatography results, we found that the digested products from each meat had different molecular weights. The ACE inhibitory ratio in all tested samples had gradually increased following by the enzyme treatments. ACE inhibitory ratios and the half maximal inhibitory concentration values indicated that digested venison was the most potent inhibitor of ACE activity, followed by the digested boar meat. The level of anserine in digested venison was higher than that in the other meats, but the carnosine level was lower. Through fractionations and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, five ACE inhibitory peptides were identified from the digested venison. Of these peptides, Isoleucine-Lysine- Glutamic Acid-Valine-Threonine-Glutamic Acid-Arginine (IKEVTER) demonstrated the highest ACE inhibitory activity. Therefore, the game meat is food that is believed potentially to offer high bioactivities, particularly antihypertensive forces.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],"Isolation, Evaluation, and Identification of Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptides from Game Meat.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854180,2020

However, the usage of methenolone in sports is banned for its doping effects. Several methods have been reported to monitor the content of methenolone in serum and urine samples, but a highly sensitive detection system has not been developed for the determination of methenolone in animal source food due to its constituent complexity. In this study, a novel detection system was developed to quantify the contents of both free and conjugated methenolone in animal source food including pork, beef, mutton, milk, and eggs by using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) coupled with delicate pretreatment procedures. The conjugated methenolone in the above food samples was released by dual enzyme digestion, and the total methenolone was extracted by 1% formic acid in acetonitrile, followed by the purification using a PRiME HLB column or QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) salt.

32134068,"The most significant cost driver for efficient bio-production of edible animal proteins is the cell culture media, where growth factors account for up to 96% of the total cost. The culture media must be serum-free, affordable, contain only food-grade ingredients, be efficient to promote cell growth and available in massive quantities. The commercially available serum substitutes are expensive and not necessarily food-grade. Identifying inexpensive food-safe alternatives to serum is crucial. By-products from food production are available in massive quantities, contain potential factors that can promote growth and are promising ingredients for serum replacement. The main goal of this study was to explore if food-grade by-product materials can be used as growth promoting agents in skeletal muscle cell culture to develop a tailor-made serum free media. Different by-products, including chicken carcass, cod backbone, eggshell membrane, egg white powder and pork plasma were enzymatically or chemically hydrolyzed. The hydrolysates in addition to lyophilized pork plasma and yeast extract were further characterized by size-exclusion chromatography, elemental combustion analysis and degree of hydrolysis. The materials were used as supplement to or replacement of commercial serum and further evaluated for their effect on metabolic activity, cell proliferation and cell cytotoxicity in muscle cells cultured in vitro. Our results indicate that none of the materials were cytotoxic to the skeletal muscle cells. Hydrolysates rich in peptides with approximately 2-15 amino acids in length were shown to improve cell growth and metabolic activity. Of all the materials tested pork plasma hydrolysates and yeast extract were the most promising. Pork plasma hydrolysates increased metabolic activity by 110% and cell proliferation with 48% when cultured in serum-free conditions for 3 days compared with control cells cultured with full serum conditions. Most interestingly, this response was dependent on both material and choice of enzyme used.

31931892,"Brominated flame retardants (BFR) are primarily used as flame retardant additives in insulating materials. These lipophilic compounds can bioaccumulate in animal tissues, leading to human exposure via food ingestion. Although their concentration in food is not yet regulated, several of these products are recognised as persistent organic pollutants; they are thought to act as endocrine disruptors. The present study aimed to characterise the occurrence of two families of BFRs (hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)) in hen eggs and broiler or pig meat in relation to their rearing environments. Epidemiological studies were carried out on 60 hen egg farms (34 without an open-air range, 26 free-range), 57 broiler farms (27 without an open-air range, 30 free-range) and 42 pig farms without an open-air range in France from 2013 to 2015. For each farm, composite samples from either 12 eggs, five broiler pectoral muscles or three pig tenderloins were obtained. Eight PBDE congeners and three HBCDD stereoisomers were quantified in product fat using gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, or high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The frequencies of PBDE detection were 28% for eggs (median concentration 0.278 ng/g fat), 72% for broiler muscle (0.392 ng/g fat) and 49% for pig muscle (0.403 ng/g fat). At least one HBCDD stereoisomer was detected in 17% of eggs (0.526 ng/g fat), 46% of broiler muscle (0.799 ng/g fat) and 36% of pig muscle (0.616 ng/g fat). Results were similar in concentration to those obtained in French surveillance surveys from 2012 to 2016. Nevertheless, the contamination of free-range eggs and broilers was found to be more frequent than that of conventional ones, suggesting that access to an open-air range could be an additional source of exposure to BFRs for animals. However, the concentration of BFRs in all products remained generally very low. No direct relationship could be established between the occurrence of BFRs in eggs and meat and the characteristics of farm buildings (age, building materials). The potential presence of BFRs in insulating materials is not likely to constitute a significant source of animal exposure as long as the animals do not have direct access to these materials.",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,"['D000383', 'D000818', 'D002645', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D000072480', 'D005411', 'D005602', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D008460', 'D013552']","['Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Farms', 'Flame Retardants', 'France', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Meat', 'Swine']",Do farming conditions influence brominated flame retardant levels in pig and poultry products?,"[None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931892,2020

31300856,"Cysteine is a crucial amino acid, found in a huge amount in protein-rich foods. We focused our research to determine the amount of free cysteine consumed highly in foods such as pork, beef, poultry, eggs, dairy, red peppers, soybeans, broccoli, brussels sprouts, oats, and wheat germs. A newly designed carbazole-pyridine-based fluorescent probe (CPI) has been introduced for quantitative estimation of cysteine (Cys) with a ""turn on"" fluorescence in some popular processed food samples chosen from our daily diet. CPI shows both naked eye and UV-visible color changes upon interaction with cysteine. The binding approach between CPI and Cys at biological pH has been thoroughly explored by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. From Job's plot analysis, 1:1 stoichiometric reaction between CPI and Cys is observed with a detection limit of 3.8 μM. NMR, ESI mass spectrometry, and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) study enlightens the formation of more stable product CPI-Cys. The ""turn on"" response of the probe CPI occurs due to the interruption of intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) process upon reacting with cysteine. Moreover, CPI is a very stable, cost-effective compound and exhibits excellent real-time selectivity towards Cys over all other comparative biorelevant analytes.

Notably, the incorporation of PRE or BRE increased the thickness, light barrier property and antioxidant activity of CS film. Moreover, the water vapor barrier property and tensile strength of CS-PRE and CS-BRE films first increased and then decreased with the increase of extract content. Due to abundant anthocyanins in the extract, CS-PRE and CS-BRE films were pH-sensitive in different buffer solutions.

Prothioconazole is a broad-spectrum thiocarbamate fungicide. It can rapidly metabolize to prothioconazole-desthio in different matrixes. Rapid and effective methods for the determination of prothioconazole-desthio in five kinds of different animal food were developed. Samples were extracted with acetonitrile or acetonitrile/water and determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The limit of detection and limit of quantification values of prothioconazole-desthio were 0.015 and 0.05 mg/kg for porcine liver and kidney, 0.0015 and 0.005 mg/kg for pork, and 0.003 and 0.01 mg/kg for eggs, together with 0.0012 and 0.004 mg/kg for milk of the detected method, respectively.

In this context, the great necessity of developing rapid and nondestructive techniques for fat and FAs analyses has been highlighted. Measurement techniques based on near-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and hyperspectral imaging have provided interesting and promising results for fat and FAs prediction in varieties of foods.

The progressive release of the feed ban required the development of new analytical methods to determine the exact origin of PAPs from meat and bone meal. We set up a promising MS-based method to determine the species and the source (legal or not) present in PAPs: a TCA-acetone protein extraction followed by a cleanup step, an in-solution tryptic digestion of 5 h (with a 1:20 protein/trypsin ratio), and mass spectrometry analyses, first without any a priori, with a Q-TOF, followed by a targeted triple-quadrupole analysis. Using this procedure, we were able to overcome some of the major limitations of the official methods to analyze PAPs, detecting and identifying prohibited animal products in feedstuffs by the monitoring of peptides specific for cows, pigs, and sheep in PAPs.

26886706,"It has been reported that isolated dietary soy and meat proteins have distinct effects on physiology and liver gene expression, but the impact on protein expression responses are unknown. Because these may differ from gene expression responses, we investigated dietary protein-induced changes in liver proteome. Rats were fed for 1 week semisynthetic diets that differed only regarding protein source; casein (reference) was fully replaced by isolated soy, chicken, fish, or pork protein. Changes in liver proteome were measured by iTRAQ labeling and LC-ESI-MS/MS. A robust set totaling 1437 unique proteins was identified and subjected to differential protein analysis and biological interpretation. Compared with casein, all other protein sources reduced the abundance of proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism and Pparα signaling pathway. All dietary proteins, except chicken, increased oxidoreductive transformation reactions but reduced energy and essential amino acid metabolic pathways. Only soy protein increased the metabolism of sulfur-containing and nonessential amino acids. Soy and fish proteins increased translation and mRNA processing, whereas only chicken protein increased TCA cycle but reduced immune responses. These findings were partially in line with previously reported transcriptome results. This study further shows the distinct effects of soy and meat proteins on liver metabolism in rats.

24942090,"Melatonin has been identified in primitive photosynthetic bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals including humans. Vegetables, fruits, cereals, wine, and beers all contain melatonin. However, the melatonin content in meats has not been reported previously. Here, for the first time, we report melatonin in meats, eggs, colostrum, and in other edible food products. The levels of melatonin measured by HPLC, in lamb, beef, pork, chicken, and fish, are comparable to other food stuffs (in the range of ng/g). These levels are significantly higher than melatonin concentrations in the blood of vertebrates.

DEHA was assessed as part of the Government of Canada's Chemicals Management Plan. The main source of exposure for most age groups was expected to be food. Although the margin of exposure from food and beverages is considered to be adequately protective, the Government of Canada committed to performing targeted surveys of DEHA in foods and food packaging materials to better define Canadian exposure to DEHA through dietary intake. In order to determine whether more-comprehensive targeted surveys on DEHA in foods should be conducted, 26 food composite samples from the 2011 Canadian total diet study were selected and analyzed for DEHA using a method based on solvent and dispersive solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These 26 food composites include cheese, meat, poultry, fish, and fast foods, and PVC films were likely used in packaging the individual foods used to make the composites. DEHA was detected in most of the meat, poultry, and fish composite samples, with the highest concentration found in ground beef (11 μg/g), followed by beef steak (9.9 μg/g), freshwater fish (7.8 μg/g), poultry liver pâté (7.4 μg/g), fresh pork (6.9 μg/g), cold cuts and luncheon meats (2.8 μg/g), veal cutlets (2.1 μg/g), roast beef (1.3 μg/g), lamb (1.2 μg/g), and organ meats (0.20 μg/g).

Polynesian outliers are islands on the fringe of Remote Oceania that were inhabited by a back migration of populations from Polynesia during prehistory. As a result of admixture with nearby island communities, little is known about the social structure and social diversity of the prehistoric inhabitants of Taumako. The distribution of prestige grave goods within the Namu cemetery has been used as evidence to support the premise that Taumakoan social structure was stratified like Polynesian societies. Here we test the hypothesis that ""wealthy"" individuals and males will display isotopic ratios indicative of the consumption of ""high status"" foods in the Pacific islands such as pork, chicken, sea turtle, and pelagic fish. The isotope results suggest the δ(34) S values were diagenetically altered, possibly an effect of volcanism. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios indicate that the diet of all the individuals included a mixture of C3 terrestrial plant foods (likely starchy staples such as yam, taro, and breadfruit, in addition to nuts) and a variety of marine resources, including reef and pelagic fish.

For that, several foods including beans, soy beans, whole rice, beef, pork, potato, and cassava were pressure-cooked and analyzed for the furan content by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry preceded by a headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME-GC/MS). Furan was not found above the limit of quantification in the pressure-cooked samples. No furan has either been found in reheated samples after 24 hours under cold storage. Although levels up to 173 μg/kg were already reported for commercial canned/jarred foods, it seems that the cooking in a pressure cooker may not represent a concern in relation to the occurrence of furan in foods.

This has led to the development of models relating tissue δ²H and δ¹⁸O values to those of water, with potential application in a number of fields. However, the strength and ubiquity of the influence of environmental water on protein isotope ratios across taxonomic groups, and thus the relevance of predictive models, is an open question. Here we report strong co-variation of δ²H and δ¹⁸O values across a suite of terrestrial and aquatic animal meats purchased in American food markets, including beef, poultry (chicken and turkey), chicken eggs, pork, lamb, freshwater fish, and marine fish. Significant isotope co-variation was not found for small collections of marine bivalves and crustaceans. These results imply that isotopic signals from environmental water were propagated similarly through most of the diverse natural and human-managed foodwebs represented by our samples. Freshwater fish had the largest variation in δ²H and δ¹⁸O values, with ranges of 121‰ and 19.2‰, respectively, reflecting the large isotopic variation in environmental freshwaters. In contrast marine animals had the smallest variation for both δ²H (7‰ range, crustaceans) and δ¹⁸O (3.0‰ range, bivalves) values.

The results showed the following: (1) when slaughtered at week 23, the TEQ for DG1 pigs (0.66±0.21pg/g fat) was under the EU limit of 1pg PCDD/F-TEQ/g fat; (2) PCDD/F congener-specific first-order elimination rates were linearly correlated with their toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs), and the rates were significantly dose-dependent for the more toxic congeners (TEF≥0.1).

MEL and CYA in egg, pork, liver, kidney and pork, shrimp, sausage casing, honey, soybean milk, soybean powder and dairy product were extracted using acetonitrile/water, defatted with hexane and isolated using MCT solid phase extraction column. The residues were separated upon a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column and analyzed by electrospray ionization under negative-positive switched mode on a triplequadrupole mass spectrometry. The selected reaction monitoring was performed on [M+H](+) of m/z 127.9 to provide the transition of 127>85 and 127>68 (MEL) while the [M-H](-) of m/z 127.1 was selected as the precursor ion for CYA resulting in product ions m/z 85 and 42.

The method was based on the microextraction of SAs in 300-mg muscle samples with 1 mL of a supramolecular solvent made up of reverse micelles of decanoic acid (DeA) and posterior determination of SAs in the extract by LC/fluorescence detection, after in situ derivatization with fluorescamine. Recoveries were quantitative (98-109%) and matrix-independent, no concentration of the extracts was required, the microextraction took about 30 min and several samples could be simultaneously treated. Formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic groups of the solvent and the target SAs (hydrogen donor and acceptor sum between 9 and 11) were considered as the major forces driving microextraction. The method was validated according to the European Union regulation 2002/657/EC. Analytical performance in terms of linearity, selectivity, trueness, precision, stability of SAs, decision limit and detection capability were determined. Quantitation limits for the different SAs ranged between 12 μg kg(-1) and 44 μg kg(-1), they being nearly independent of matrix composition.

20227703,"This work describes a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) procedure for multiplex screening, ultratrace quantification and reliable confirmation of barbital series residues in animal-derived food matrices. The method is developed based on a distinct dependency of the electrospray ionization (ESI) response of nine structural homologues on LC eluent properties and gas-phase ion chemistry during the ESI process. The ""wrong-way-round"" negative ionization aspect has been explored to optimize the compatibility of the hyphenated LC-MS/MS technique, which facilitates detection limits at 30-100-fold lower than 0.01 ppm without derivatization or post-column basification step. A mobile phase using methanol modified with 0.01% acetic acid is adopted to achieve an approximately 2-9-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio over the results under suboptimal conditions. There is no significant differential matrix effects or deuterium isotope effects on chromatographic retention and ESI responsiveness at all levels across the different analyte-matrix pairs. Mean recoveries ranged from 79.6% (barbital) to 108% (secobarbital) at fortified levels of 0.5-20 ng/g within relative standard deviations less than 11%. Between-run repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility were 3-11% and 5-13%, respectively. An ion ratio criterion for valid detection limit data for simultaneous screening of homologous multiresidues in complex sample matrices is proposed.

The concentrations of manganese, copper, molybdenum, zinc, iron, selenium, cadmium and lead were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after microwave digestion. Mean values and their respective coefficients of variation were calculated from the measured concentrations. The concentrations found for cadmium and lead ranged from 0.6 to 3.9 μg/100 g and 1.0 to 2.1 μg/100 g, respectively. Concentrations ranged between 0.5 and 3.3 mg/100 g for iron, 0.7 and 5.1 mg/100 g for zinc, 9 and 44 μg/100 g for selenium, 3.1 and 16.7 μg/100 g for manganese, 0.3 and 132 μg/100 g for copper and 0.9 and 3.2 μg/100 g for molybdenum. Differences found for the concentrations in meat from different species as well as between the individual meat cuts were notable for iron, zinc, selenium and copper. Manganese concentrations were found to vary unsystematically within muscles and species. Molybdenum concentrations were higher in chicken meat in comparison with the mammalian meats. The highest coefficients of variation were found for manganese (13% to 142%) and copper (13% to 224%), while the lowest was found for zinc (4% to 45%).

18986150,"The effects of cooking processes commonly used by the population of Catalonia (Spain) on total arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) concentrations in various foodstuffs were investigated. All food samples were randomly acquired in local markets, big supermarkets, and grocery stores of Reus (Catalonia). Foods included fish (sardine, hake, and tuna), meat (veal steak, loin of pork, breast and thigh of chicken, and steak and rib of lamb), string bean, potato, rice, and olive oil. For each food item, two composite samples were prepared for metal analyses, whose levels in raw and cooked (fried, grilled, roasted, and boiled) samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The highest concentrations of As, Hg, and Pb (raw and cooked samples) were mainly found in fish, with a clear tendency, in general, to increase metal concentrations after cooking. However, in these samples, Cd levels were very close to their detection limit. In turn, the concentrations of metals in raw and cooked meat samples were detected in all samples (As) or only in a very few samples (Cd, Hg, and Pb). A similar finding corresponded to string beans, rice, and olive oil, while in potatoes, Hg could not be detected and Pb only was detected in the raw samples. In summary, the results of the present study show that, in general terms, the cooking process is only of a very limited value as a means of reducing metal concentrations.

Development of a simple and sensitive method for the determination of SAs residues in food of animal origin, therefore, is of great significance. An on-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) method using multiwalled carbon nanotubes as sorbent coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for simultaneous determination of 10 sulfonamides (SAs) in eggs and pork was developed. The adsorptive potential of carbon nanotubes for solid-phase extraction of sulfonamides was investigated for the first time in the present paper. To on-line interface solid-phase extraction with HPLC, a conventional sample loop on the six-port injector valve of the HPLC was replaced by a preconcentration column packed with carbon nanotubes. The analytes in water solution were preconcentrated onto the preconcentration column and subsequently eluted with mobile phase of methanol-water (22:78). The developed on-line solid-phase extraction method for HPLC permitted the current HPLC separation and the next preconcentration proceeded in parallel, and thus allows one determination finished within 35 min.

Smaller areas of Laos and Cambodia were also sprayed with Agent Orange between 1962 and 1971 from fixed-wing aircraft. In 2001, 28 food samples consisting of meat, fish, and dairy products were collected in sprayed and nonsprayed areas of Laos and analyzed for dioxins, dioxinlike dibenzofurans, and selected polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry at laboratories in Germany and Canada. Low levels of dioxin and other dioxinlike substances were found in Laotian food, similar to levels present in recent exported Vietnamese food to United States. Vietnam is geographically adjacent to Laos. Total dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) levels were similar in samples from sprayed and non-sprayed areas, ranging from 0.009 to 0.851 pg/g or parts per trillion (ppt) in sprayed Sepone, and from 0.022 to 0.537 pg/g or ppt wet weight in non sprayed Vientiane.

Ochratoxin A is suspected of playing a role in the Balkan Endemic Nephropathy, a nephropathology described in Balkan areas where ochratoxin A is often found in cereals and in pork-derived products. In North Africa like Tunisia where high incidence of chronic interstitial nephropathies of unknown aetiology are pointed out, the involvement of ochratoxin A was suspected but contradictory studies on the degree of human exposure did not succeed in evidencing the role of ochratoxin A. In the present work, sera from 47 volunteers hospitalised for nephropathic damages including bladder tumours (21 people), and from 62 patients hospitalised for disorders other than nephropathic ones, were analysed for ochratoxin A contents. The determination of ochratoxin A in sera was done by a validated immunoaffinity-HPLC method. Sera from unaffected population exhibited percentages of 74.2%, 22.6% and 3.2% containing ranges of ochratoxin A as <0.10-0.5 microg/l, 0.51-1.0 microg/l and above 1.0 microg/l respectively.

The volunteers also provided three daily total volume 8-h urine samples for the duration of the study for the assessment of 1-hydroxypyrene, a biomarker of pyrene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure. Mean recoveries were 83 and 75%, respectively, for pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene in food. Daily dietary pyrene doses varied from 0.7 to 3 microg. Excluding two outliers consisting of meals containing charbroiled pork and beef, pyrene content in the meals estimated from the published literature data was correlated to the measured pyrene, but overestimated the actual concentration by ca. 70%. Despite the identical ingested doses of pyrene, there was a 50-76% (coefficient of variation) interindividual variability in the daily-excreted amount of 1-hydroxypyrene. Urinary excretion of this metabolite was not correlated with ingested dose of pyrene under the normal feeding conditions used in this study. Bioavailability, enzymatic polymorphism, and differences in enterohepatic cycling of the metabolite may contribute to the observed variability. It was calculated that dietary pyrene intake accounts for between 87.5 and 99.8% of the sum of dietary and inhalation intake.

Laboratory-cooked beef, pork, and chicken are capable of producing tens of nanograms of MeIQx, IFP, and PhIP per gram of meat and smaller amounts of other heteroyclic amines. Well-done restaurant-cooked beef, pork, and chicken may contain PhIP and IFP at concentrations as high as tens of nanograms per gram and MeIQx at levels up to 3 ng/g. Although well-done chicken breast prepared in the laboratory may contain large amounts of PhIP, a survey of flame-grilled meat samples cooked in private homes showed PhIP levels in beef steak and chicken breast are not significantly different (P=0.36). The extremely high PhIP levels reported in some studies of grilled chicken are not seen in home-cooked samples.Many studies suggest individuals may have varying susceptibility to carcinogens and that diet may influence metabolism, thus affecting cancer susceptibility. To understand the human metabolism of PhIP, we examined urinary metabolites of PhIP in volunteers following a single well-done meat exposure. Using solid-phase extraction and LC/MS/MS, we quantified four major PhIP metabolites in human urine. In addition to investigating individual variation, we examined the interaction of PhIP with a potentially chemopreventive food. In a preliminary study of the effect of broccoli on PhIP metabolism, we fed chicken to six volunteers before and after eating steamed broccoli daily for 3 days. Preliminary results suggest that broccoli, which contains isothiocyanates shown to induce Phases I and II metabolism in vitro, may affect both the rate of metabolite excretion and the metabolic products of a dietary carcinogen.

11417661,"The 2-alkylcyclobutanone method was adopted as a European Standard (EN1785) and MAFF Validated Method (MAFF V37) in 1996 for the detection of irradiated food containing fat. As the method requires a relatively long period (ca 2 days) of time for extraction of the 2-alkylcyclobutanones from a foodstuff, a means was sought to increase the speed at which these irradiation markers could be isolated while at the same time decreasing the amount of organic solvents required. Thus, the technique of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was investigated. Results showed that SFE can be used for the rapid extraction (60 min) of lipid from irradiated foods such as chicken, pork, liquid whole egg, ground beef, and from the seeds of irradiated mango and papaya with only 10 mL n-hexane being necessary for collection of the extracted sample. A method was also developed whereby the 2-alkylcyclobutanones can be selectively extracted from irradiated foods without prior extraction of the lipid. The sample extract, in 10 mL n-hexane, is purified through a Florisil SPE cartridge which is washed with 10 mL n-hexane and the 2-alkylcyclobutanones eluted with 10 mL 2% diethyl ether in n-hexane before analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 2-Dodecylcyclobutanone and 2-tetradecylcyclobutanone were selectively extracted from irradiated chicken meat, liquid whole egg, ground beef, and mango as well as from beef burgers and baked products containing irradiated ground beef and liquid whole egg, respectively.

The theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) of oestradiol-17beta by consumption of cattle meat is calculated to be 4.3 ng. Following the use of oestradiol-containing growth-promoting agents, TMDI is increased by a factor of 4.6 to 20 ng oestradiol-17beta, assuming that single dosage and 'good animal husbandry' are observed. Pork and poultry probably contain similar amounts of oestrogens as untreated cattle. The mean concentration of oestradiol-17beta in whole milk is estimated at 6.4 pg/ml. Scarce data available on eggs report up to 200 pg/g oestradiol-17beta. The risk evaluation of oestrogenic growth-promoting agents is limited by analytical uncertainties. Residues of oestradiol-17alpha and the importance of oestrogen conjugates are widely unknown. The performance of mass spectrometry still needs to be improved for confirmation of oestrogen concentrations in most food. At present, the potential relevance of oestradiol acyl esters, the actual daily production rate of oestradiol in prepubertal children, and the role of oestradiol metabolites in cancer are obscure.

10350440,"Meats, such as beef, pork, poultry, and fish, cooked at high temperatures produce heterocyclic aromatic amines, which have been implicated indirectly as etiological agents involved in colorectal and other cancers in humans. This study examined the urinary excretion of a mutagenic/carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amine, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), among 45 African-American, 42 Asian-American (Chinese or Japanese), and 42 non-Hispanic white male residents of Los Angeles who consumed an unrestricted diet. Total PhIP (free and conjugated) was isolated from overnight urine collections, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, and then quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Geometric mean levels of PhIP in Asian-Americans and African-Americans were approximately 2.8-fold higher than in whites. The urinary excretion levels of PhIP were not associated with intake frequencies of any cooked meat based on a self-administered dietary questionnaire, in contrast to our earlier finding (Ji et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 3: 407-411, 1994) of a positive and statistically significant association between bacon intake and the urinary level of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) among this same group of study subjects. Although there is a statistically significant association between urinary levels of PhIP and MeIQx (2-sided P = 0.001), 10 subjects (8%) displayed extreme discordance between urinary PhIP and MeIQx levels. Several factors, including variable contents of heterocyclic aromatic amines in food, enzymic and interindividual metabolic differences, and analytical methodology determine the degree of concordance between the urinary excretion levels of PhIP and MeIQx. Accordingly, urinary excretion levels of a single heterocyclic aromatic amine can only serve as an approximate measure of another in estimating exposure to these compounds in humans consuming unrestricted diets.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology","['D000328', 'D001213', 'D044383', 'D006801', 'D007093', 'D015141', 'D008297', 'D008460', 'D009369', 'D011810', 'D011795', 'D044465']","['Adult', 'Asian Americans', 'Blacks', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles', 'Los Angeles', 'Male', 'Meat', 'Neoplasms', 'Quinoxalines', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Whites']","Urinary excretion of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in White, African-American, and Asian-American men in Los Angeles County.","[None, None, None, None, 'Q000652', 'Q000453', None, 'Q000009', 'Q000208', 'Q000652', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'urine', 'epidemiology', None, 'adverse effects', 'ethnology', 'urine', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10350440,1999

The choice of foods, including beef, pork, poultry, game, fish, egg and sausages, was based on an investigation of an elderly population in Stockholm participating in an analytical epidemiological case-control study on cancer risks after intake of heterocyclic amines. The food items were prepared using normal household cooking practices, and to reflect the wide range of surface browning of the cooked dishes that would be encountered in this population, four cooking temperatures were used in the range 150-225 degrees C. For all food samples, the total amount of heterocyclic amines formed at 150 degrees C was less than 1 ng/g cooked product, and at 175 degrees C less than 2 ng/g. The highest concentrations of heterocyclic amines were detected in fillet of pork, reindeer meat and chicken breast fried at 200 and 225 degrees C and their corresponding pan residues. The total sum of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo-[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine was about 1 microgram per 100 g portion (including pan residues) for reindeer meat and chicken breast, and between 1.9 and 6.3 micrograms per 100-g portion for fillet of pork.

We believe that literature estimates of 20:4(n-6) intake of 200-1000 mg/d are too high, possibly because of incorrect values in food composition tables where high amounts of 20:4(n-6) are recorded in margarines, some vegetable products and animal fat. We assessed the 20:4(n-6) content of common Australian foods and found that the 20:4(n-6) levels (on a 100-g edible basis), were 891 mg and 390 mg, respectively, for duck and chicken egg yolks, 294 mg for liver, 153 mg for kidney, 75 mg for skinless turkey, 56 mg for lean pork, 49 mg for lean lamb, 31 mg for chicken breast, 56 mg for chicken legs and 35 mg for lean beef. Eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5(n-3)] levels were < 10 mg/100 g in chicken meat, turkey meat, emu meat and chicken eggs, whereas the values for 20:5(n-3) for beef, lamb, liver, kidney and duck egg yolk ranged from 11 to 138 mg/100 g food. Applying our current 20:4(n-6) measurements to previously determined food intakes of Australian adults determined in an Australiawide survey in 1983, we estimated the mean 20:4(n-6) intake for Australian adult males to be 130 mg/d and females 96 mg/d.

7517165,"The selenium concentration in foods grown and consumed and in plasma, red blood cells, and toenails of people living in the district of Chita in the transbaikalian part of Russia were studied in August 1991. Preliminary results from the area have suggested low selenium intakes and the possible occurrence of cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease) in the population. A low selenium concentration in foods grown locally was found: mean selenium concentration in wheat grains was 1, 5, and 28 micrograms/kg, respectively, in three villages studied, that of oats was between 3-6 micrograms/kg, and of cow's milk 10-27 micrograms/kg dry matter. The selenium concentration of bread was considerably higher, between 87-337 micrograms/kg dry wt, presumably because wheat imported from the US had been used for baking. Occasional samples of pork, beef, and mutton contained between 32-218 micrograms selenium/kg dry wt. Low selenium concentrations were observed in samples of soil and river water. The mean plasma selenium concentration of 52 persons was 1.02 mumol/L, including 33 children and 19 adult subjects. The selenium concentrations in red blood cells and toenails were 1.95 mumol/L and 0.61 mg/kg, respectively. No symptoms of heart disease caused by selenium deficiency were observed. It is concluded that the selenium status of people was fairly good thanks to the contribution to dietary intake of imported wheat with a high selenium content.

2017211,"Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are common contaminants of processed food, usually at trace levels. These hydrocarbons are products of combustion and pyrolysis, and are present in petroleum and coal, and in products derived from them. Most polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are not carcinogenic, but some of them are, and a few are potent inducers of skin and lung tumors in mice. Their carcinogenic properties have not been fully explored, but they seem to be less potent by ingestion or inhalation, and they are known as a group to produce cancer in humans. The most effective carcinogens among them are those with 5 or 6 fused rings, and these tend to be less prevalent in mixtures than the 3- and 4-ring hydrocarbons, most of which are not carcinogenic. Sophisticated analytical methods, using solvent extraction and chromatography have been developed to detect and measure polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons at levels of 1 in 10(9) (1 part per billion) or less, and these have been applied to the measurement of individual compounds in foods, as well as in products of combustion and pyrolysis. Wood smoke and smoked foods contain the carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene at levels of 1 ppb, and other hydrocarbons; liquid smoke has lower levels. Crude vegetable oils have higher concentrations, but purified 'deodorized' oils have benzo[a]pyrene levels near 1 ppb. Sausages cooked over burning logs had as much as 200 ppb benzo[a]pyrene. Charcoal-broiled steaks and ground meat had benzo[a]pyrene concentrations up to 50 micrograms/kg, while less fatty pork and chicken had lower concentrations (up to 10 micrograms/kg). It was probable that the rendered fat dripped on to the hot charcoal and pyrolyzed to form quantities of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, which rose with the smoke to deposit on the meat. Therefore, oven cooking or cooking with a heat source above the meat, or segregation of the meat from the smoke resulted in food containing negligible amounts of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Modifications of cookings practices accordingly would greatly reduce exposure to this group of carcinogens.",Mutation research,"['D000818', 'D015197', 'D002417', 'D003296', 'D005506', 'D006358', 'D008460', 'D011083', 'D013552']","['Animals', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Cattle', 'Cooking', 'Food Contamination', 'Hot Temperature', 'Meat', 'Polycyclic Compounds', 'Swine']",The formation and occurrence of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons associated with food.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2017211,1991

A total of 34% were found to have the capacity to produce ochratoxin A; 14.5% had concentrations greater than 1.0 mg/kg. In 1988, 1200 blood samples were obtained from swine destined for slaughter in western Canada. High-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that 3.6% of the 194 blood samples collected in February and March and 4.2% of the 1006 collected in May, June and July had concentrations of ochratoxin A that exceeded 20 ng/ml. In a subsequent survey of porcine blood carried out in 1989-90, 16-65% of the samples had detectable levels of ochratoxin A, at mean concentrations of 5.4-19.4 ng/ml.

2591018,"Creatine or one of 15 amino acids were mixed with minced pork before broiling at 200 degrees C. Total mutagenic activity and reversed-phase HPLC-separated mutagenicity profiles were determined for the crust and pan residue of all samples and also in the aerosol fraction of the smoke formed during cooking of the creatine-fortified samples. Addition of 5% (w/w) creatine increased the total mutagenicity 4-fold without changing the mutagenicity profile of either crust, pan residue or aerosol. Amino acid addition (1% w/w) increased the total mutagenicity between 1.5 (lysine) and 43 times (threonine). In most cases the mutagenicity profiles of crust and pan residues were changed by amino acid addition. Dry-heated mixtures of amino acids and creatine were all mutagenic with a 250-fold range between the amino acids. The production of known food mutagens in these mixtures was analyzed by LC-MS of HPLC-fractionated mutagenic peaks. Serine, threonine, phenylalanine, alanine, leucine and tyrosine were all shown to give rise to one of the known food mutagens 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) or 2-amino-trimethylimidazopyridine (TMIP). Lyophilized and subsequently fried meat patties and a heated powder of lyophilized meat juice were both mutagenic, with mutagenicity profiles similar to the regular meat crust, showing that water is not a prerequisite for mutagen formation in meat. MeIQx, 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-di-MeIQx) and PhIP were shown, by LC-MS, to be present in the dry-heated meat juice. It is concluded that creatine and free amino acids are the main reactants of the mutagen-forming reactions that occur during frying of meat.

3553187,"The existence in invertebrates, unicellular eukaryotes, and prokaryotes of materials that resemble several vertebrate peptide hormones led to the suggestion that these peptide messengers may have arisen earlier in evolution than had previously been thought. Consistent with this hypothesis, we describe here material in two plants, spinach and Lemma gibba G3, that is very similar to mammalian insulin, yet distinctive. In each of the early purification steps, which consisted of acidic methanol chloroform extraction and sequential chromatography on C-18 hydrophobic resin, Sephadex G-50, CM-Sepharose, and a short C-3 high performance liquid chromatography column, the immunoactive material from plants resembled the common vertebrate insulins. The protein nature of the material was suggested by its destruction by Pronase but not by the inactivated enzyme. In addition, on TSK chromatography it eluted in a position similar to that of insulin, i.e. equivalent to a protein of 6000 daltons. Using an isocratic high performance liquid chromatography system, the plant immunoactivity eluted earlier, and thus was more hydrophilic, than most of the common mammalian insulins, including pork insulin. The interaction of the plant material with anti-insulin antibodies in a radioimmunoassay was confirmed by using an affinity column of anti-insulin antibodies which adsorbed the plant immunoactivity at neutral pH, and released the material with acid elution. Using a quantitative double radioimmunoassay, the plant insulin-like material was distinguished immunologically from chicken insulin. Although the plant insulin-like material is clearly distinct from pork insulin chromatographically, and from chicken insulin immunologically, it resembles vertebrate insulins in its overall configuration. The plant insulin-like material bound to insulin receptors on IM-9 lymphocytes and stimulated glucose oxidation and lipogenesis in isolated adipocytes from young rats. The bioactivity was neutralized in the presence of anti-insulin antibodies, but not in the presence of normal guinea pig IgG. The role of this insulin-like material in plants is unknown but its existence is consistent with an early evolutionary origin of the insulin messenger peptide family. Alternatively we cannot exclude a later convergent development of this family or introduction of vertebrate DNA into plants.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D001681', 'D002460', 'D002851', 'D007328', 'D007330', 'D010944', 'D011402', 'D011863', 'D011972']","['Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Antibodies', 'Plants', 'Pronase', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Receptor, Insulin']",Partial purification and characterization of an insulin-like material from spinach and Lemna gibba G3.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000276', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'immunology', 'analysis', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3553187,1987

With the methods adopted the following were examined in the plasma: total cholesterol, triglycerides, total fat and beta-lipoproteins. After bleeding the birds, extracts from the aorta intima and media and maturing egg cell yolk balls were made by the method of Folch et al., and then they were analysed with thin-layer chromatography on silica gel (Kieselgel-Fertigplatten DC Merck). Following densimetric measurements, the results obtained were statistically analysed, tabled and plotted in chromatograms. In general, almost a double concentration increase in the total cholesterol and fat, triglycerides and beta-lipoproteins was observed in comparison with control group. In the aorta analysed chromatographically, the mean level of phospholipids, free fatty acids, triglycerides and ester cholesterol increased almost twice, and that of monoglycerides ten times. In egg cell yolk more than a double increase in the level of phospholipids, triple of monoglycerides and over triple of free cholesterol and fatty acids, over quadruple of triglycerides and over sevenfold of free cholesterol was observed.
