35531409,"Consumption of soybean-based foods is affected by the flavor of the legume; due to the presence of undesirable compounds called ""beany flavors"". To solve this problem, the influence of solid state fermentation by lactobacilli on the production of volatile compounds in soybean paste was determined. The volatile's production was measured by gas chromatography. Forty compounds were identified in the different soybean pastes studied. The results showed that fermentation stimulates the production of desirable volatile compounds in foods such as ketones (22-75%) and decreased unpleasant compounds (10-84%).The consumers acceptance study showed that a group of participants (30% approximately) preferred the fermented samples associated with sweet and acid aroma like yogurt. In conclusion, the fermentation positively influences the generation of desirable volatile compounds and completely reduces hexanal in one sample. Therefore, fermentation with the studied strains is a valid strategy to modify the aroma profile of a soybean-based food matrix.",Journal of food science and technology,[],[],Aroma compounds and consumer acceptability of soybean paste fermented by lactobacilli.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35531409,2022

34964911,"In recent years, the use of bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus species has received much attention in different areas, including using as probiotics, food preservation, and as broad antimicrobial spectrum activity. In this study, a bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strain was isolated from traditional yogurt. The isolate was identified by morphological, biochemical, 16S rRNA analyses, and designated as Latilactobacillus curvatus LAB-3H. The primary antimicrobial activity of the isolate was evaluated on Micrococcus luteus PTCC 1408 by the agar gel diffusion method. The growth of L. curvatus LAB-3H in MRS broth at 37 °C and its antimicrobial activity against Lactobacillus casei ATCC 39,392 was evaluated. In batch culture analysis, bacteriocin production starts at the early exponential growth phase and continues to the middle of the stationary phase about (660 AU/ml) at 28 h and pH 3.8. Bacteriocin produced by L. curvatus LAB-3H showed antibacterial activity against some selected foodborne pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes PTCC1294, Bacillus cereus PTCC1857, Staphylococcus aureus PTCC1917, and Escherichia coli PTCC1276. For purification of bacteriocin, ammonium sulfate precipitation and cation exchange chromatography methods were used. The maximum antimicrobial activity observed was about 3985.15 AU/mg of protein, which was a 249.22-fold increase, and 5.21% yield compared with that in the cell-free supernatant.

34760249,"Flaxseed oil as a natural ingredient has many health benefits due to the rich contents of omega-3 fatty acids. However, its use in food formulations is limited because of low aqueous solubility, easy oxidation owing to the unsaturated nature of the fatty acids such as omega-3. The aim of this study was to prepare a stable nanoemulsion containing flaxseed oil and investigate the fortification of yogurt with this nanoemulsion compared with fortification with bulk flaxseed oil. The nanoemulsion of flaxseed oil-in-water was obtained by low-energy emulsification method. Optimized nanoemulsion contains 3% (w/w) flaxseed vegetable oil, 36% (w/w) surfactant, 10% (w/w) co-surfactant, and 51% (w/w) deionized water as a continuous phase. The result of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the optimal size was about 60 nm, which was stayed stable for 11 months. The results of gas chromatography (GC) indicated that the amount of omega-3 in nanoemulsion containing flaxseed oil was 27.3% and 19.8% after 7 days and 11 months, respectively. The turbidity results indicated the transparency of nanoemulsion after 11 months as well. The results of centrifuge experiments and thermal stress cycles exhibited that the optimized nanoemulsion was physically stable without any sign of creaming, phase separation, and cracking. In addition, pH and acidity of the yogurt fortified with nanoemulsion containing flaxseed oil were 4.22 and 1.41 wt%, respectively. In conclusion, fortifying yogurt with the nanoemulsion containing flaxseed oil can be considered as a solution to increase solubility, bioavailability, and protection of omega-3.",Food science & nutrition,[],[],Yogurt fortified with omega-3 using nanoemulsion containing flaxseed oil: Investigation of physicochemical properties.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34760249,2021

In this study, the PCL-microcapsules loaded with OLs polyphenols extract powder were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectrometry analysis. Their total phenolic (TPC), total flavonoid (TFC) contents, and antioxidant activities (DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS), and polyphenols stability were measured after oral, gastric, and intestinal steps of in vitro digestion. PCL-microcapsules were utilized in formulating novel functional yogurt containing 0, 25, 50, and 75 mg of TPC estimated as mg GAE (added as PCL-microcapsules) per 100g yogurt. All yogurt samples were evaluated for their pH, acidity, syneresis, viscosity, and color during storage. In vitro digestion significantly affected the phenolic composition in non-encapsulated extract whereas it had a lower impact on encapsulated phenolics. Higher protection was provided for encapsulated OLs extract and their higher release was observed at the intestinal phase. Unlike the undigested OLs extract, which had a TPC of 490 mg GAE/100 g, lower values of TPC (136 and 289 mg GAE/100 g) were obtained for non-encapsulated and encapsulated OLs extract, respectively, in the intestinal fluids.

Previous human intervention studies identified several biomarkers for dairy foods in blood and urine using non-targeted metabolomics. We evaluated the robustness of these biomarkers in a free-living cohort in the Netherlands using both single- and multi-marker approaches. Plasma and urine from 246 participants (54 ± 13 years) who completed a food frequency questionnaire were analyzed using liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The targeted metabolite panel included 37 previously-identified candidate biomarkers of milk, cheese, and/or yoghurt consumption. Associations between biomarkers and energy-adjusted dairy food intakes were assessed by a 'single-marker' generalized linear model, and stepwise regression was used to select the best 'multi-marker' panel. Multi-marker models that also accounted for common covariates better captured the subtle differences for milk (urinary galactose, galactitol; sex, body mass index, age) and cheese (plasma pentadecanoic acid, isoleucine, glutamic acid) over single-marker models. No significant associations were observed for yogurt.

In recent years, a growing development in the food industry of dairy products with higher protein content has emerged in the national market. Métodos: the present work analyzed the nutritional information, protein content, and amino acid profile of high protein yogurts. Five main brands of high-protein yogurt (PY) were selected, as was a sample of regular yogurt (RY), and one of whey protein isolate (WP), which underwent a proximal analysis and amino acid profile by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: it was observed that the protein content of the analyzed YP ranged between 7.2 and 15.1 g/portion, representing 6.8 % to 11 % of total content, twice the content of YBAT (3,4 %). Regarding carbohydrates and fats, these were found to range between 6.25 and 13.5 g/serving and 0.9 and 5.3 g/serving, respectively. Leucine content of the PY varied between 0.6 and 1.5 g/portion, which was higher than RY (0.3 g/portion) and lower than WP (2.2 g/portion). The sum of essential amino acids was found to be between 3 and 6.9 g/portion in PY, 1.7 g/serving y 8.5 g/serving in WP.

Off-flavors generated during 90-d ambient storage (25 °C) of PDY from reconstituted skim milk were investigated by sensory evaluation, volatile component analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-olfactometry. Rancid off-flavor was induced by increased fatty acid concentration due to fat decomposition by heat-stable lipase. Masking of off-flavors was inhibited by degradation of diacetyl, which originally contributed to yogurt-like flavors. Maillard reaction particular to ambient storage of PDY resulted in changes in the furaneol and sotolon levels, which may be involved in enhancement of off-flavors. Finally, our findings indicated that production of 4-vinylguaiacol may be involved in off-flavor development.

33138259,"Tryptophan (TRP) is an essential amino acid which cannot be synthesized by humans and animals, but has to be supplied by exogenous sources, notably through the diet. The bulk of dietary TRP flows into the synthesis of body's proteins, but the TRP metabolism also involves several biochemical reactions (i.e., serotonin and kynurenine pathways). Defects in the TRP transport mechanism or catabolism are related to a large number of clinical abnormalities. Therefore, dietary TRP intake is necessary not only for the body's growth but also for most of the body's metabolic functions. Among protein-based foods, milk proteins provide a relatively high amount of TRP. In this paper, a rapid chromatographic method for TRP determination in yoghurt, by ultra high performance liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column with fluorescence detection (280 nm Ex; 360 nm Em), is provided.

32925990,"Microbiological purity control of food products is of great importance in the food industry. Contaminated food is often characterized by a deteriorated taste, smell, and appearance, and when consumed, it can pose a threat to human health and life. Also, contamination incurs huge financial losses to the food industry. Different methods are used for identification of the microorganisms isolated from food, which are based on phenotypic, immunologic, genetic, and spectroscopic techniques. Unfortunately, these methods have the following disadvantages: laborious, time-consuming, requiring a well-trained spectrometer operator with specialist knowledge, or very accurate, but complicated, and extremely expensive. In recent years, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been gaining increasing importance in the field of food microbiology. Unlike other techniques used for microorganisms identification, MALDI-TOF MS is more rapid, accurate and cost-efficient, and easy to perform. Thus, this method can be applied in the food industry to quickly and accurately identify microorganisms, which is crucial for controlling the quality of food products.

The retention capacity of WPA differed from the one of WPI for three out of seven aroma compounds detected in HS-GC. Incorporating WPA in fat-free yogurts tended to decrease the release of hydrophobic aroma compounds such as 2-nonanone or methyl-cinnamate. The magnitude of the differences between the partition coefficients of yogurts enriched in WPI or WPA was lower than in aqueous solutions, which is likely to be due to the higher complexity of the food matrix and potential interactions with other ingredients.

Therefore, much interest has been given to natural food additives, namely colourants. In this work, a bilberry extract was primarily characterized in terms of anthocyanin compounds by UPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn, and its colouring capacity was further compared with a synthetic anthocyanin colourant (E163) in different yogurt formulations. The prepared samples were evaluated in different periods (0 and 7 days) for nutritional profile, individual fatty acids, soluble sugars and external colour to determine the effects of each additive. Overall, the major anthocyanin compounds in bilberry were malvidin glycoside and delphinidin glycoside derivatives. With regard to the prepared yogurts, all samples maintained the nutritional profile, individual fatty acids and soluble sugars, independent of storage time. Nonetheless, bilberry extracts showed lower colouring capacity when compared to that of E163, despite the higher stability of bilberry extract throughout the storage time, when compared to that of E163.

Functional yoghurt fortified with DPP in three forms was prepared and their physicochemical, microstructure, texture and sensory characteristics were assessed. The micro morphology was explored via Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed for functional groups detection. Phenolic compounds were detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) while fatty acids were identified via Gas Liquid Chromatography (GLC). Cytotoxicity of DPP nanocapsules was evaluated against RPE1 cell line (BJ1). The Egyptian date palm pollen grains evaluation revealed its rich content of protein and carbohydrate (36.28 and 17.14 g/ 100g), high content of Fe, Zn and Mg (226.5, 124.4 and 318 mg/100g), unsaturated fatty acids ω-3, ω-6 and ω-9 (8.76, 20.26 and 7.11 g/100g, which was increased by ethanol extraction) and phenolic compounds especially catechin (191.73 μg/mL) which was pronounced in DPP antioxidant potentials (IC50 35.54 mg/g).

31514309,"There is mounting evidence that the consumption of fermented dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt is associated with a reduced risk of type II diabetes. This effect is greater than in fresh milk and differs between cheese and yoghurt. However, the molecular components responsible for the effect are not known. We tested the hypothesis that the lipid and/or glyceride profiles of yoghurts and cheeses are distinct from one another and fresh milk. We developed a novel sample preparation technique for high-fat samples that can be used with Direct Infusion-Mass Spectrometry. We found that the lipid and glyceride profiles of cheddars from the UK, Ireland and France, and hard cheeses from Sweden and Italy were similar to one another but distinct from unfermented dairy products. The lipid and glyceride profile of yoghurts was varied and included types that may be similar to fresh milk. Several odd-chain-containing triglycerides were more abundant, while a variety of others were less abundant, in fermented milk samples. Phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were more abundant in cheeses, with evidence that the phosphatidylethanomine profile is re-modelled in a way that reflects the bacterial cell envelope. We concluded that a combination of microorganismal metabolism, concentration of the lipid/glyceride fraction and oxidation during fermentation contribute to the observed lipid profile if fermented dairy foods. These differences in the lipid and glyceride profile provide a new avenue for understanding why different fermented dairy foods show a different association with reduced disease risk compared to unfermented dairy.",Nutrients,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D003924', 'D005285', 'D005516', 'D005989', 'D006801', 'D000081362', 'D008055', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D009753', 'D015014']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Fermentation', 'Food Microbiology', 'Glycerides', 'Humans', 'Lipidomics', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Nutritive Value', 'Yogurt']",Fermentation of Milk into Yoghurt and Cheese Leads to Contrasting Lipid and Glyceride Profiles.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'metabolism', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514309,2020

31206188,"Oak wood is used in barrels for wine aging. During aging, polyphenols are transferred from the barrels to the liquid. Although the bioactivity of oak polyphenols in wines has been extensively studied, no investigation exists on their toxicological properties, which limits their use as functional safe ingredients for other products. In this work, the chemical composition of a polyphenolic extract of Quercus crassifolia bark (QCBe) was studied by GC-MS. Its antibacterial properties on probiotic and pathogenic bacteria and its subacute-oral toxicity were determined as a way to understand the potential impact from its addition to fermented food as a functional ingredient. QCBe shows a selective inhibition of Escherichia coli compared with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophylus. According to the toxicity evaluation, the subacute no-observed-adverse-effect-level was achieved at 11 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the subacute lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level for kidney damage was at 33 mg/kg bw/day. These results suggest that, given the fact an adverse effect was observed after subacute administration of this extract, further longer term toxicological studies are needed to provide sufficient safety evidence for its use in humans. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Mexico's yogurt market is growing which creates opportunities for the development of some yogurt products as functional foods. As a first step to evaluate its potential use in yogurt formulation, the antibacterial effect of a Quercus crassifolia polyphenolic extract (QCBe) on probiotic bacteria and its subacute-oral toxicity in rats were studied. A low inhibition on probiotic bacteria growth was observed after QCBe addition to Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophylus cultures. Exposure to QCBe for a subacute duration resulted in renal injury in rats at dosages greater than or equal to 33 mg/kg/bw/day.

The HPLC chromatographic pigment pattern corresponding to the betaxanthin-rich extract revealed the presence of four betaxanthins, of which indicaxanthin (proline-betaxanthin) accounts for around 85%. A betaxanthin-rich water-soluble food colorant from cactus pears fruits was produced by spray-drying microencapsulation using maltodextrin as a wall material. The resulting powder was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and its apparent color was analyzed by spectrometry. The stability of the microcapsules was examined at +20, +4 and -20 °C in the dark during six months of storage. The degradation of betaxanthins was delayed by microencapsulation and their colorant stability increased at lower temperatures. The potential application of the colorant microcapsules was successfully assessed in two food model systems: a yogurt and a soft-drink. Both foods presented an attractive pale yellow color. Pigment retention and color parameters were investigated during storage under controlled conditions. Slight changes in the pigment retention, in both model systems, pointed to excellent preservation in the dark, even after 28 days at 4 °C. However, the presence of light contributed to betaxanthin deterioration. Spray-drying microencapsulation succeeds in reducing volumen of the pigment extract and can be easy in storage and delivery of the powders.

29172090,"Lead exposure remains an important public health problem. Contaminated foods may act as a source of lead exposure, while certain nutrients may reduce lead absorption. We examined the cross-sectional associations of dietary patterns and the intake of several nutrients and foods with blood (Pb-B) and urinary (Pb-U) lead concentrations in children (5-8y) from Montevideo, Uruguay. From two 24-hour recalls completed by caregivers, we derived the mean daily intake of select nutrients and food groups (dairy, milk, fruit, root vegetables, foods rich in heme and non-heme iron), as well as ""nutrient dense"" and ""processed"" food patterns. Pb-B (n=315) was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry; Pb-U (n=321) using ICP-MS. Pb-U was adjusted for specific gravity and log-transformed to approximate a normal distribution. Iron deficiency (ID) and dietary variables were tested as predictors of Pb-B and log-Pb-U in covariate-adjusted regressions. Median [5%, 95%] Pb-B and Pb-U were 3.8 [0.8-7.8] μg/dL and 1.9 [0.6-5.1] μg/L, respectively; ~25% of Pb-B above current U.S. CDC reference concentration of 5μg/dL. ID was associated with 0.75μg/dL higher Pb-B, compared to non-ID (p<0.05). Consumption of root vegetables was not associated with Pb-B or log-Pb-U. Higher scores on the nutrient-dense pattern were related with higher Pb-Bs, possibly due to consumption of green leafy vegetables. Dietary intake of iron or iron-rich foods was not associated with biomarkers of lead. Conversely, children consuming more calcium, dairy, milk and yogurt had lower Pb-B and log-Pb-U. Our findings appear consistent with existing recommendations on including calcium-rich, but not iron- or vitamin-C-rich foods in the diets of lead-exposed children, especially where the consumption of these foods is low.",Environment international,"['D002648', 'D002947', 'D003611', 'D004032', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D005260', 'D005638', 'D006801', 'D000090463', 'D007854', 'D008297', 'D009752', 'D014583', 'D014675']","['Child', 'Cities', 'Dairy Products', 'Diet', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Iron Deficiencies', 'Lead', 'Male', 'Nutritional Status', 'Uruguay', 'Vegetables']",Nutritional status and diet as predictors of children's lead concentrations in blood and urine.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000097', None, None, None, None, 'Q000097', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, 'blood', None, None, None, None, 'blood', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172090,2018

Commercial yogurts are produced using standard starters while, in the production of non-commercial yogurt, the microbiota is quite different since yogurts are used as starter for years. To determine the final characteristics of the fermented product it is necessary to know the biochemical properties of the starter cultures, such as acidity, aroma and flavor. This can only be achieved by identifying and characterizing the bacteria in starter cultures. In our study, 208 non-commercial yogurt samples were collected from 9 different locations in Anatolia, southern Turkey. Their pH and lactic acid bacteria profiles were analyzed. Isolated bacteria were identified by MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser sesorption-ionization time-of-flight, mass spectrometry), which is a fast and reliable method for identification of bacterial isolates compared to classical laboratory methods. In this study, 41% of the isolates were identified by using this method, which is 99.9% and 34.0% confidence. The isolates contained two genera (Enterococcus and Lactobacillus) and four species. Afterwards, the four lactic acid bacteria were characterized physiologically and biochemically and we found that they differed from lactic acid bacteria used in commercial yogurt production.

28518086,"Proton Transfer Reaction (PTR), combined with a Time-of-Flight (ToF) Mass Spectrometer (MS) is an analytical approach based on chemical ionization that belongs to the Direct-Injection Mass Spectrometric (DIMS) technologies. These techniques allow the rapid determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), assuring high sensitivity and accuracy. In general, PTR-MS requires neither sample preparation nor sample destruction, allowing real time and non-invasive analysis of samples. PTR-MS are exploited in many fields, from environmental and atmospheric chemistry to medical and biological sciences. More recently, we developed a methodology based on coupling PTR-ToF-MS with an automated sampler and tailored data analysis tools, to increase the degree of automation and, consequently, to enhance the potential of the technique. This approach allowed us to monitor bioprocesses (e.g. enzymatic oxidation, alcoholic fermentation), to screen large sample sets (e.g. different origins, entire germoplasms) and to analyze several experimental modes (e.g. different concentrations of a given ingredient, different intensities of a specific technological parameter) in terms of VOC content. Here, we report the experimental protocols exemplifying different possible applications of our methodology: i.e. the detection of VOCs released during lactic acid fermentation of yogurt (on-line bioprocess monitoring), the monitoring of VOCs associated with different apple cultivars (large-scale screening), and the in vivo study of retronasal VOC release during coffee drinking (nosespace analysis).",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"['D001331', 'D003069', 'D005285', 'D005504', 'D005838', 'D006801', 'D019344', 'D027845', 'D013058', 'D009296', 'D011522', 'D055549', 'D015014']","['Automation', 'Coffee', 'Fermentation', 'Food Analysis', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid', 'Malus', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Nasal Cavity', 'Protons', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Yogurt']","PTR-ToF-MS Coupled with an Automated Sampling System and Tailored Data Analysis for Food Studies: Bioprocess Monitoring, Screening and Nose-space Analysis.","[None, None, None, 'Q000295', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000235', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, 'instrumentation', None, None, 'analysis', 'genetics', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28518086,2018

Among antifungal LAB, Lactobacillus harbinensis K.V9.3.1Np showed a remarkable antifungal activity for the bioprotection of fermented milk without modifying their organoleptic properties (Delavenne et al., 2015). The aim of the present study was to elucidate the action mechanism of this bioprotective strain against the spoilage yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. To do so, yeast viability, membrane potential, intracellular pH (pHi) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were assessed using flow cytometry analyses after 3, 6 and 10days incubation in cell-free supernatants. The tested supernatants were obtained after milk fermentation with yogurt starter cultures either in co-culture with L. harbinensis K.V9.3.1Np (active supernatant) or not (control supernatant). Scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) was used to monitor yeast cell morphology and 9 known antifungal organic acids were quantified in both yogurt supernatants using high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Yeast growth occurred within 3days incubation in control supernatant, while it was prevented for up to 10days by the active supernatant. Interestingly, between 66 and 99% of yeast cells were under a viable but non-cultivable (VNC) state despite an absence of membrane integrity loss. While ROS production was not increased in active supernatant, cell physiological changes including membrane depolarization and pHi decrease were highlighted. Moreover, morphological changes including membrane collapsing and cell lysis were observed. These effects could be attributed to the synergistic action of organic acids. Indeed, among the 8 organic acids quantified in active supernatant, five of them (acetic, lactic, 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic, hexanoic and 2-hydroxybenzoic acids) were at significantly higher concentrations in the active supernatant than in the control one.

For these reasons, nano-liposome was used to nano-encapsulate fish oil in this study and encapsulated fish oil was utilized in fortifying yogurt. Physicochemical properties of produced yogurt including pH, acidity, syneresis, fatty acid composition, peroxide value as well as sensory tests were investigated during three weeks storage at 4°C. Nano-liposome encapsulation resulted in a significant reduction in acidity, syneresis and peroxide value.

The volatile compounds were extracted and analyzed by SPME-GC-MS and cheese odour and aroma profiles were studied by descriptive sensory analysis. Control cheese was made only with a mesophilic starter and experimental cheeses with L. reuteri were made with and without glycerol. The addition of L. reuteri INIA P572 to milk enhanced the formation of six volatile compounds. Despite the changes in the volatile compounds profile, the use of L. reuteri INIA P572 did not noticeably affect the sensory characteristics of cheese. On the other hand, the addition of L. reuteri INIA P572 coupled with 30mM glycerol enhanced the formation of twelve volatile compounds, but decreased the formation of five ones. The use of the biopreservation system did not affect overall odour and aroma quality of cheese although it resulted in a significant decrease of the odour intensity scores. In addition, this cheese received significant higher scores for ""cheesy"" aroma and significant lower scores for the aroma attributes ""milky"", ""caramel"" and ""yogurt-like"". The first two axes of a principal component analysis (PCA) performed for selected volatile compounds and sensory characteristics, accounting for 75% of the variability between cheeses, separated cheeses made with L. reuteri INIA P572 and glycerol from the rest of cheeses, and also differentiated control cheese from cheeses made with L. reuteri INIA P572 from day 60 onward. Our results showed that the reuterin-producing L. reuteri INIA P572 strain, when coupled with glycerol, may be a suitable biopreservation system to use in cheese without affecting odour and aroma quality.

Conventional methods to detect melamine in foods, such as Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), are sensitive but they are time-consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. In this research, near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging technique combined with regression coefficient of partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was used to detect melamine particles in milk powders easily and quickly. NIR hyperspectral reflectance imaging data in the spectral range of 990-1700nm were acquired from melamine-milk powder mixture samples prepared at various concentrations ranging from 0.02% to 1%. PLSR models were developed to correlate the spectral data (independent variables) with melamine concentration (dependent variables) in melamine-milk powder mixture samples. PLSR models applying various pretreatment methods were used to reconstruct the two-dimensional PLS images. PLS images were converted to the binary images to detect the suspected melamine pixels in milk powder. As the melamine concentration was increased, the numbers of suspected melamine pixels of binary images were also increased. These results suggested that NIR hyperspectral imaging technique and the PLSR model can be regarded as an effective tool to detect melamine particles in milk powders.

The Method Developer evaluation for the validation of the GlutenTox Pro Test Kit (Biomedal Diagnostics, Sevilla, Spain) for the detection of gluten in foods and on surfaces was conducted at Biomedal, S. L., Camas, Sevilla, Spain. The GlutenTox Pro test method was evaluated by testing the following: cross-reactivity, interference, specificity and sensitivity, robustness, stability, lot-to-lot variation, food matrix, and environmental surface. To evaluate the performance of the GlutenToxPro test for the detection of gluten, 10 matrixes were selected: rice flour, bread/biscuit, rolled oat, pâté, and yogurt (and a second bread matrix for incurred sampled testing) for the food matrix study and food-grade painted wood, plastic, rubber, sealed ceramic, and stainless steel for the environmental surface matrix study. For the food matrix study, 30 replicates were evaluated at six spiked levels of gluten (0, 3, 8, 15, 25, and 45 ppm) against four detection thresholds (5, 10, 20, and 40 ppm) for each food matrix. Additionally, 10 replicates were evaluated at a concentration of 10,000 ppm using all four detection thresholds only for rice flour matrix. Three replicates of each concentration level of gluten were analyzed using paired samples by the AOAC OMA 2012.01 reference method for each food matrix. For the environmental surface study, 30 replicates were evaluated at a low spike level of gluten (16 ng/16 cm2), five replicates at a high spike level of gluten (400 ng/16 cm2), and five replicates at an unspiked control level (0 ng/16 cm2) for each surface matrix. Upon completion of testing, the probability of detection values and confidence intervals were calculated and plotted versus the concentration level as determined by the reference method when applicable.

The method is based on the simultaneous protein precipitation and AFM1 extraction, by salt-induced liquid-liquid extraction (SI-LLE), followed by an online solid-phase extraction (online SPE) coupled to ultra-high-pressure-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis to the automatic pre-concentration, clean up and sensitive and selective determination of AFM1. The main parameters affecting the extraction efficiency and accuracy of the analytical method were studied in detail. In the optimal conditions, acetonitrile and NaCl were used as extraction/denaturant solvent and salting-out agent in SI-LLE, respectively. After centrifugation, the organic phase (acetonitrile) was diluted with water (1:9 v/v) and purified (1mL) by online C18 cartridge coupled with an UHPLC column. Finally, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition mode was applied to the detection of AFM1. Validation studies were carried out on different dairy products (whole and skimmed cow milk, yogurt, goat milk, and powder infant formula), providing method quantification limits about 25 times lower than AFM1 maximum levels permitted by EU regulation 1881/2006 in milk and dairy products for direct human consumption. Recoveries (86-102%) and repeatability (RSD<3, n=6) meet the performance criteria required by EU regulation N. 401/2006 for the determination of the levels of mycotoxins in foodstuffs. Moreover, no matrix effects were observed in the different milk and dairy products studied. The proposed method improves the performance of AFM1 analysis in milk samples as AFM1 determination is performed with a degree of accuracy higher than the conventional methods.

26182471,"A rapid method for the simultaneous determination of vitamins A, D3 and E in infant formula and adult nutritions has been developed using online two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC). First of all, C8 and polar embedded C18 columns were chosen as the first and second dimensional column respectively according to hydrophobic-subtraction model, which constituted excellent orthogonal separation system. The detection wavelengths were set at 263 nm for vitamin D3, 296 nm for vitamin E and 325 nm for vitamin A. The purification of vitamin D3 and quantifications of vitamins A and E were completed simultaneously in the first dimensional separation using the left pump of Dual Gradient LC (DGLC) with methanol, acetonitrile and water as mobile phases. The heart-cutting time window of vitamin D3 was confirmed according to the retention time of vitamin D3 in the first dimensional separation. The elute from the first dimensional column (1-D column) which contained vitamin D3 was collected by a 500 µL sample loop and then taken into the second dimensional column (2-D column) by the right pump of DGLC with methanol, acetonitrile and water as mobile phases. The quantification of vitamin D3 was performed in the second dimensional separation with vitamin D2 as internal standard. At last, this method was applied for the analysis of the three vitamins in milk powder, cheese and yogurt. The injected sample solution with no further purification was pre-treated by hot-saponification using 1. 25 kg/L KOH solution and extracted by petroleum ether solvent. The recoveries of vitamin D3 spiked in all samples were 75.50%-85.00%. There was no statistically significant difference for the results between this method and standard method through t-test.

25547312,"The present study was conducted to evaluate the lactic acid- and acetaldehyde-producing abilities of lactic acid bacterial species isolated from traditionally manufactured Turkish yogurts using HPLC. The lactic acid bacterial species purified from the yogurts were the 2 most widely used species in industrial yogurt production: Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. These bacteria have the ability to ferment hexose sugars homofermentatively to generate lactic acid and some carbonyl compounds, such as acetaldehyde through pyruvate metabolism. The levels of the compounds produced during fermentation influence the texture and the flavor of the yogurt and are themselves influenced by the chemical composition of the milk, processing conditions, and the metabolic activity of the starter culture. In the study, morphological, biochemical, and molecular characteristics were employed to identify the bacteria obtained from homemade yogurts produced in different regions of Turkey. A collection of 91 Strep. thermophilus and 35 L. bulgaricus strains were investigated for their lactic acid- and acetaldehyde-formation capabilities in various media such as cow milk, LM17 agar, and aerobic-anaerobic SM17 agar or de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar. The amounts of the metabolites generated by each strain in all conditions were quantified by HPLC. The levels were found to vary depending on the species, the strain, and the growth conditions used. Whereas lactic acid production ranged between 0 and 77.9 mg/kg for Strep. thermophilus strains, it ranged from 0 to 103.5 mg/kg for L. bulgaricus. Correspondingly, the ability to generate acetaldehyde ranged from 0 to 105.9 mg/kg in Strep. thermophilus and from 0 to 126.9 mg/kg in L. bulgaricus. Our study constitutes the first attempt to determine characteristics of the wild strains isolated from traditional Turkish yogurts, and the approach presented here, which reveals the differences in metabolite production abilities of the wild lactic acid bacteria strains, holds the potential for the selection of the most desirable strains to be used as starters in commercial yogurt manufacture in the future.

24856400,"A new and sensitive determination method was developed for bovine lactoferrin in dairy products including infant formulas based on the signature peptide by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography and triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry under the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The simple pretreatment procedures included the addition of a winged peptide containing the isotope-labeled signature peptide as internal standard, followed by an enzymatic digestion with trypsin. The signature peptide was chosen and identified from the tryptic hydrolyzates of bovine lactoferrin by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry based on sequence database search. Analytes were separated on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH 300 C18 column and monitored by MS/MS in seven minutes. Quantitative result bias due to matrix effect and tryptic efficiency was corrected through the use of synthetic isotope-labeled standards. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0.3 mg/100 g and 1.0 mg/100 g, respectively. Bovine lactoferrin within the concentration range of 10-1000 nmol L(-1) showed a strong linear relationship with a linear correlation coefficient (r) of >0.998. The intra- and inter-day precision of the method were RSD<6.5% and RSD<7.1%, respectively.

The procedure is based on (i) separation of the intact esters via reversed-phase ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography; (ii) detection by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry; and (iii) quantitation using selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Employing a C8 column, phytostanyl fatty acid esters sharing the same stanol nucleus could be separated according to the esterified fatty acids while esters with different stanol moieties could be distinguished via SIM based on the formation of an intense fragment ion [M - fatty acid + H](+). The suitability of the approach was demonstrated using different types of enriched foods reflecting the diversity in potential matrices (skimmed milk drinking yogurt, margarine, and soft-cheese-style spread).

In this study, the interaction between different proteolytic strains of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was investigated in terms of microbial growth, acidification and changes in the biochemical composition of milk during set-yoghurt fermentation. A complementary metabolomics approach was applied for global characterization of volatile and non-volatile polar metabolite profiles of yoghurt associated with proteolytic activity of the individual strains in the starter cultures. The results demonstrated that only non-proteolytic S. thermophilus (Prt-) strain performed proto-cooperation with L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The proto-cooperation resulted in significant higher populations of the two species, faster milk acidification, significant abundance of aroma volatiles and non-volatile metabolites desirable for a good organoleptic quality of yoghurt. Headspace SPME-GC/MS and (1)H NMR resulted in the identification of 35 volatiles and 43 non-volatile polar metabolites, respectively.

24456594,"L-Pyroglutamic acid succinimidyl ester (L-PGA-OSu) and its isotopic variant (L-PGA[d5]-OSu) were newly synthesized and evaluated as the chiral labeling reagents for the enantioseparation of amino acids, in terms of separation efficiency by reversed-phase chromatography and detection sensitivity by ESI-MS/MS. The enantiomers of amino acids were easily labeled with the reagents at 60°C within 10 min in an alkaline medium containing triethylamine. Although all the diastereomers derived from 18 proteolytic amino acids could not be satisfactorily separated, the pairs of 9 amino acids were completely separated by reversed-phase chromatography using the small particle (1.7 μm) ODS column (Rs=1.95-8.05). The characteristic daughter ions, i.e., m/z 84.04 and m/z 89.04, were detected from all the derivatives by the collision induced dissociation of the protonated molecular ions. A highly sensitive detection at a low-fmol level (0.5-3.2 fmol) was also obtained from the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) chromatograms. An isotope labeling strategy using light and heavy L-PGA-OSu for the differential analysis of the DL-amino acids in different sample groups is also presented in this paper. The differential analysis of biological sample (i.e., human serum) and food product (i.e., yogurt) were tried to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The ratios of the DL-amino acids in human serum samples, spiked with the different concentrations of D-amino acids, were determined by the procedures using L-PGA-OSu and L-PGA[d5]-OSu. The D/L ratios in the two sample groups at different concentrations of amino acids were similar to the theoretical values. Furthermore, the ratios of D/L-alanine values in different yogurt products were comparable to the ratios obtained from the d/l values using only light reagent (i.e., L-PGA-OSu).

Linear responses for BCM5 and BCM7 (R(2)=0.9985 and 0.9986, respectively) was observed in the range 0.01-10ng/μL. The method limits of detection (MLDs) in yoghurt extracts were found to be 0.5 and 0.25ng/g for BCM5 and BCM7, respectively. Analyses of spiked samples were used to provide confirmation of accuracy and precision of the analytical method. Recoveries relative to the surrogate standards of these spikes were in the range of 95-106% for BCM5 and 103-109% for BCM7. Precision from analysis of spiked samples was expressed as relative standard deviation (%RSD) and values were in the range 1-16% for BCM5 and 1-6% for BCM7. Inter-day reproducibility was between 2.0-6.4% for BCM5 and between 3.2-6.1% for BCM7. The validated isotope dilution LC-MS/MS method was used to measure BCM5 and BCM7 in ten commercial and laboratory prepared samples of yoghurt and milk. Neither BCM5 nor BCM7 was detected in commercial yoghurts. However, they were observed in milk and laboratory prepared yoghurts and interestingly their levels decreased during processing.

The quality and quantity of retronasal aroma released during food consumption affect the exposure time of olfactory receptors to aroma stimuli, which can influence nutritional and hedonic characteristics, as well as consumption behaviors. In yogurts, fruit preparation formulation can be a key factor to modulate aroma stimulation. In this context, the impact of size and hardness of fruit pieces in fat-free pear yogurts was studied. Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) was used to allow sensitive and on-line monitoring of volatile odorous compound release in the breath during consumption. In parallel, a trained panel used sensory profile and Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) methods to characterize yogurt sensory properties and their dynamic changes during consumption. Results showed that the size of pear pieces had few effects on aroma release and perception of yogurts, whereas fruit hardness significantly influenced them. Despite the fact that yogurts presented short and similar residence times in the mouth, this study showed that fruit preparation could be an interesting formulation factor to enhance exposure time to stimuli and thus modify food consumption behaviors.

23515856,"Viili has been traditionally regarded as healthy food; viili exopolysaccharides (VEPS) function as antioxidants, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms, especially its immune functions, remain largely unclear. To assess VEPS's immunological roles, VEPS were separated by Sevage's method and purified by anion exchange chromatography. Cell proliferation, phagocytosis, releases of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and iNOS protein by Western blotting, and morphology by scanning electron microscopy in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/VEPS-stimulated and non-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages were analyzed. VEPS increased cell proliferation at 50-200 μg/mL. The uptake of neutral red for the indication of phagocytosis and releases of NO, IL-6, and IL-1β were enhanced after exposure to LPS and VEPS. Gene expressions of iNOS, IL-6, and IL-1β and protein expressions of iNOS were increased with VEPS. The RAW264.7 cell treated with VEPS became flattened, a strong indication of the activation of macrophages. We concluded that VEPS promoted the activation of macrophages in which NO, IL-6, and IL-1β were involved; the release of NO and other cytokines may eventually activate lymphocytes, increasing nonspecific (innate) and specific immunity in humans.

All VLYB had values of pH lower than 4.0 and both selected starters remained viable at ca. 8.4 log cfu/g throughout storage. All VLYB showed high values of apparent viscosity and water holding capacity. During fermentation, lactic acid bacteria consumed glucose, fructose, and malic acid, which was supplied with grape must. Compared to control vegetable yogurt-like beverages (CVYLB), without bacterial inoculum, an increase of total free amino acids (FAA) was found during fermentation and storage.

An appropriate sample clean-up using solid-phase extraction (SPE) allowed detection of a large number of low-molecular-mass bioactive peptides by reversed-phase microLC-TOF-MS. The preliminary identification was solely based on the experimental monoisotopic molecular mass values (M(exp)). Later, we evaluated the correlations between predicted normalized elution time (NET) and experimental normalized retention times (t(r)') values to describe the retention behavior of the proposed sequences. The assistance of retention prediction proved to be useful to improve reliability of the identification, avoiding misinterpretations and solving some identity conflicts.

We have examined the possibility of distinguishing different commercial cyanide samples through the δ(13)C and δ(15)N values and developed a protocol for the isotope analysis of cyanide extracted from several matrices as food and medicine. Several cyanide precipitates were tested for the isotope analysis. The results show that cupric ferrocyanide Cu(2)[Fe(CN)(6)] is the most appropriate precipitate for the analysis. Thirteen batches of KCN and nine batches of NaCN chemicals were randomly chosen from different suppliers. The cyanides were converted to cupric ferrocyanide and then analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry coupled to elemental analysis (EA-IRMS). The isotopic signature of the commercial samples varied from -51.96 to -25.77 ‰ for δ(13)C and from -4.51 to +3.81 ‰ for δ(15)N, highlighting the potential of applying EA-IRMS technique to identify cyanide from different batches and sources. The influence of the cyanide extraction and isolation from spiked matrix on the isotopic analysis was also studied. Three matrices: orange juice, yogurt drink and a medicine were tested. In many cases, the isotopic analysis results obtained from the original cyanides precipitates and those isolated from the matrices showed a good accordance, especially for δ(15)N.

This review outlines the production of the major flavor compounds in yogurt fermentation and the analysis techniques, both instrumental and sensory, for quantifying the volatile compounds in yogurt. The volatile compounds that have been identified in plain yogurt are summarized, with the few key aroma compounds described in detail. Most flavor compounds in yogurt are produced from lipolysis of milkfat and microbiological transformations of lactose and citrate. More than 100 volatiles, including carbonyl compounds, alcohols, acids, esters, hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds, sulfur-containing compounds, and heterocyclic compounds, are found in yogurt at low to trace concentrations. Besides lactic acid, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetoin, acetone, and 2-butanone contribute most to the typical aroma and flavor of yogurt. Extended storage of yogurt causes off-flavor development, which is mainly attributed to the production of undesired aldehydes and fatty acids during lipid oxidation.

A range of different dairy matrices was manufactured from raw milk in a pilot plant and subjected to in vitro digestion using an infant gut model. Digestion products were identified using MS and immunochemical techniques. Results obtained showed that CNs were able to resist digestion, particularly κ- and αs(2)-CN. Resistant areas were identified and corresponded to fragments hydrophobic at pH 3.0 (gastric conditions) and/or carrying post-translational modifications (phosphorylation and glycosylation).

20432097,"The case of isopropylthioxanthone (ITX) showed conclusively that the ingredients of ultraviolet printing inks may migrate into packaged foodstuffs. For multilayered materials like beverage cartons, the only way that mass transfer can occur is by the so-called set-off effect. In contrast, in the case of rigid plastics like yoghurt cups, two other methods of mass transfer, permeation and gas phase, have to be considered. In cooperation with producers of ink, plastic cups and yoghurt, a project was conducted in order to elucidate the mass transfer of ink ingredients. In addition, the influence of storage time and the age of ultraviolet lamps on the migration level was examined. The suitability of 50% ethanol as a simulant for yoghurt was also tested. ITX was chosen as a model migrant, as it is easily detectable. Furthermore, the migration of two other substances, the photo-initiator 2-methyl-4'-(methylthio)-2-morpholinopropiophenone (MTMP) and the amine synergist ethyl-4-(dimethylamino)benzoate (EDAB), which may be used in combination with ITX, was studied. Before being filled with yoghurt or 50% ethanol, the printed cups were stored under different contact conditions, with and without contact between the inner layer and the printed surfaces, in order to distinguish between the possible mass transfer ways. All analyses were performed by means of high performance liquid chromatography with diode array and fluorescence detection (HPLC-DAD/FLD). It was shown that contamination with ITX and EDAB occurs via set-off and that the degree of migration increases with lamp age and storage time of the unfilled cups. Migration of MTMP was not detectable. The results show that besides the careful selection of the appropriate raw materials for printing ink, a close monitoring of the process also plays a major role in migration control. In addition, the results proved that 50% ethanol is a suitable simulant for yoghurt.","Food additives & contaminants.

These attributes provide lactoferricin and other natural bioactive peptides with the potential to be functional food ingredients that can be used by the food industry in a variety of applications. At present, commercial uses of these types of compounds are limited by the scarcity of information on their ability to survive food processing environments.

Analysis of the hydrolysis products isolated from these experiments indicates degradation of this peptide near neutral pH by lactic acid bacteria-associated peptidases, the extent of which was influenced by the bacterial strain used. However, the data also showed that compared to other milk-derived bioactive peptides that undergo complete degradation under these conditions, the 25-amino acid lactoferricin is apparently more resistant, with approximately 50% of the starting material remaining after 4 h of incubation.

In addition, the enantiomeric composition of 11 atropisomeric PCB has been determined for the first time in this type of product, using heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatography and 2 enantioselective columns for the unambiguous determination of both enantiomers. Results showed a deviation from the racemic composition for PCB 135, 136, 176, 171, and 183 in the samples analyzed. Whereas PCB 135, 136, and 176 showed an enrichment of the first eluted enantiomer, congeners 171 and 183 showed an enrichment of the first or second eluted enantiomer depending on the dairy product and species. The remaining congeners analyzed (PCB 84, 91, 95, 132, 149, and 174) did not present a clear enrichment of any of the enantiomers.

18048371,"The paper describes a mechanistic mathematical model for aroma release in the oropharynx to the nasal cavity during food consumption. The model is based on the physiology of the swallowing process and is validated with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization coupled with mass spectrometry measurements of aroma concentration in the nasal cavity of subjects eating flavored yogurt. The study is conducted on 3 aroma compounds representative for strawberry flavor (ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, and ethyl hexanoate) and 3 panelists. The model provides reasonably accurate time predictions of the relative aroma concentration in the nasal cavity and is able to simulate successive swallowing events as well as imperfect velopharyngeal closure. The most influent parameters are found to be the amount of the residual product in the pharynx and its contact area with the air flux, the volume of the nasal cavity, the equilibrium air/product partition coefficient of the volatile compound, the breath airflow rate, as well as the mass transfer coefficient of the aroma compound in the product, and the amount of product in the mouth.

Interestingly, there has been an increased consumption of dietary supplements containing this element in the form of either inorganic or organic compounds. The effect of using selenium as a dietary supplement in yogurt has been evaluated. For this purpose, different concentrations of inorganic Se (ranging from 0.2 to 5000 microg g(-1)) have been added to milk before the fermentation process. Biotransformation of inorganic Se into organic species has been carefully evaluated by ion-exchange, reversed-phase, or size-exclusion chromatography, coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Yogurt fermentation in the presence of up to 2 microg g(-1) of Se(IV) produces a complete incorporation of this element into proteins as has been demonstrated applying a dialysis procedure. Analysis by SEC-ICP-MS showed that most of them have a molecular mass in the range of 30-70 kDa.

17566979,"Several studies have described the synthetic preparation of Sb(V) complexes with organic ligands, but only recently was such a complex identified to exist in beverages stored in PET containers. In the present study, we have investigated by using HPLC-ICPMS and HPLC-ES-MS(/MS), the formation of Sb(V) complexes in various biological (urine) and food matrixes (yoghurt and juice) spiked with noncomplexed inorganic Sb(V). Our results show that Sb(V) complex formation is matrix dependent and that several Sb(V) complexes form to a considerable extent in these matrixes. The results also suggest that the existence of Sb(V) complexes in natural samples may have previously been overlooked due to analytical method limitations, mainly chromatographic, but also detection limitations when hydride generation is used. To overcome some of these limitations, we have developed chromatographic methods suitable for preserving Sb-organic ligand complexes during their separation. When applying this mild nondestructive chromatographic method, we were able to identify novel Sb complexes in yoghurt spiked with inorganic Sb(V), i.e., 1:1 Sb(V)-citrate, 1:1 Sb(V)-lactate, 1:2 Sb(V)-lactate, and other Sb(V)-lactate complexes. This is the first characterization of Sb(V)-lactate complexes. Detailed studies on the hydride generation (HG) efficiency of Sb(V) complexes showed that Sb(V) complexes of high stability, such as Sb(V)-citrate, Sb(V)-(adenosine)n and Sb(V)-(lactate)n (n = 1 or 2), are nondetectable by HG-ICPMS. Furthermore, Sb(V) complexes formed in natural biological and food matrixes were only partly detectable by HG-ICPMS, confirming limitations of analytical methods based on HG volatilization and subsequent stibine detection in natural samples containing complexing ligands with affinity toward Sb(V).",Analytical chemistry,"['D000965', 'D002851', 'D002951', 'D005504', 'D007773', 'D011092', 'D011093', 'D021241', 'D015014']","['Antimony', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Citrates', 'Food Analysis', 'Lactates', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Polyethylene Terephthalates', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Yogurt']",Identification of Sb(V) complexes in biological and food matrixes and their stibine formation efficiency during hydride generation with ICPMS detection.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None]","['analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17566979,2007

A special focus was placed on the recovery rates of the isolation procedure and on robust quantitation by LC-MS. For these purposes protein internal standards were employed. The observed recovery rates of beta-lactoglobulin from various samples ranged from 100% for whole milk to just over 50% for a strongly processed yogurt-based baby food product. The influence of processing was investigated in greater detail, showing that an increasing intensity of the applied heat treatment resulted in an increasing loss of beta-lactoglobulin.

A good way to raise the CLA content in the diet without a radical change in eating habits seems to be the enrichment of commonly consumed food products with CLA supplements. This study analyzed the total fatty acid content and the CLA isomer composition of 6 commercially available CLA-fortified dairy products during processing and 10 wk of refrigerated storage. Research was carried out by combining gas chromatography and silver-ion HPLC. The tested samples were a CLA oil supplement, and several skim milk dairy products fortified with the supplement (milk, milk powder, fermented milk, yogurt, fresh cheese, and milk-juice blend). The CLA oil supplement was added such that the consumer received 2.4 g/d of CLA by consuming 2 servings.

These major isomers were not significantly affected by processing but a decrease in total CLA in fresh cheese samples was detected after 10 wk of refrigerated storage. Refrigerated storage and thermal treatment resulted in significant decreases or disappearance of some of the minor CLA isomers and a significant increase of trans, trans isomers from both cis, trans, trans, cis, and cis, cis isomers especially in CLA-fortified milk powder but also in fermented milk, yogurt, and milk-juice blend.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D002849', 'D002851', 'D005410', 'D005511', 'D005527', 'D007536', 'D044243', 'D008892', 'D013997']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flame Ionization', 'Food Handling', 'Food, Fortified', 'Isomerism', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk', 'Time Factors']",Hot topic: Fatty acid and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer composition of commercial CLA-fortified dairy products: evaluation after processing and storage.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17430905,2008

The method is based on the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) technique with hot water as extractant. After dispersing samples of milk and yoghurt on sand, target compounds were eluted from the MSPD column by passing through it 5 mL of water acidified with 30 mmol/L formic acid and heated at 70 degrees C. After pH adjustment and filtration, a volume of 200 microL of the aqueous extract was directly injected into the LC column. MS data acquisition was generally performed in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, selecting two precursor ion to product ion transitions for each target compound. Hot water appeared to be an efficient extracting medium, since absolute recoveries of the analytes in milk and yoghurt were respectively 68-86% and 82-96%. The method proved to be robust as matrix effects, even though present, did not affect significantly the accuracy of the method, as evidenced by analyzing six different batches of both milk and yoghurt. Using roxithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic not used in veterinary medicine) as surrogate internal standard, the accuracy of the method at three different spike levels of the analytes in milk and yoghurt was 86-107% (RSDs not larger than 10%) and 97-117% (RSDs not larger than 13%), respectively.

16512246,"A new sensitive and low-cost method that combines continuous acid extraction, online preconcentration, and flame atomic absorption spectrometry for cadmium determination at microg levels in solid and semisolid milk products is described. A continuous ultrasound-assisted extraction system is used to carry out the dynamic acid extraction step. The acid extract is preconcentrated online on a minicolumn packed with a chelating resin (Chelite P, with aminomethylphosphoric acid groups), and the retained cadmium is eluted with hydrochloric acid and continuously monitored by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. An experimental design (Plackett-Burman 2-6*3/16) is used to optimize the continuous extraction and the preconcentration step. The method allowed a total sampling frequency of 28 samples/h.

Pigments were extracted from four native maize varieties (Arrocillo, Peruano, Purepecha and Cónico), which possess a high anthocyanin concentration in the pericarp. Pericarp and aleurone layer were mechanicallly removed from grain using a Strong-Scott barley pearled. Yields of pericarp and aleurone layer fraction (PALF) were evaluated. Total anthocyanin content in this fraction was determined by a conventional spectrophotometric method and the anthocyanin profile was obtained by HPLC. One mg of anthocyanin extracts from the PALF was added to 100 g of a commercial plain yogurt. Yogurt samples were kept under refrigerated conditions and color and pH were monitored every 5 days interval, during three weeks. The yields of PALF were 48.4%, 55.1%, 40.2%, and 40.0% for Arrocillo, Peruano, Cónico and Purepecha varieties, respectivelly. The highest total anthocyanin content (259.4 mg of anthocyanins/100 g sample) was observed in Peruano PALF. The color of yogurts dyed with each of the four extracts was different. Yogurts dyed with Peruano and Arrocillo extracts showed a more intense reddish tone than those dyed with Cónico and Purepecha.

Effect of culture, medium, and their interaction on flavor was assessed and compared by sensory descriptive analysis and headspace volatile analysis by proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry. In general, the aroma of fermented whey was similar to that of whey separated from fermented milk, indicating a favorable possibility of substituting milk with whey in the manufacture of fermented milk-like beverages. Starter culture significantly affected most sensory characteristics of the products. Key volatile compounds for the characteristic flavor of yogurt, such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl, were not significantly affected by medium when fermented with the yogurt culture, and reached similar levels in both systems. Volatile analysis results were consistent with the results of the sensory evaluation, indicating the high reliability of proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry in detecting important volatile compounds for aroma.

Flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Retention time of CoQ10 was 10.9 +/- 0.1 min. The method was sensitive [limit of detection (LOD) = 0.2 mg/kg], reproducible [relative standard deviation (RSD) = 3:0%), and linear up to 25 mg/kg (R > 0.999). LC/MS analysis was performed on a LUNA C18 3 microm, 150 x 4.6 mm column, using mobile phase consisting of ethanol-dioxane-acetic acid (9 + 1 + 0.01, v/v/v), flow rate was 0.6 mL/min, and the retention time of CoQ10 was 4.1 +/- 0.1 min.

The concentration of the H2B1a component of IVM was analysed in these dairy products using an HPLC method with fluorescence detection. The mean recovery of the method was, depending on the matrix, between 87 and 100%. Limits of detection in the order of only 0.1 microg H2B1a/kg of product were achieved. Maximum concentrations of IVM were detected mostly at 2 d after drug administration to the ewes. The highest concentration of IVM was found on day 2 in 60-day ripened cheese (96 microg H2B1a/kg cheese). Secondary whey was the matrix with the lowest concentration of IVM (<0.6 microg H2B1a/ kg). Residue levels fell below the limits of detection between day 5 (for secondary whey) and day 25 (for all cheese samples). In the matrices investigated, linear correlations between daily concentrations of IVM, milk fat and solid content were evident. During yoghurt production, fermentation and thermal stability of IVM was observed. During cheese production, approximately 35% of the IVM, present in the raw (bulk) milk samples, was lost.

14694818,"Cow milk and dairy products supply essential inorganic elements for humans, and constitute the most important source of bioavailable calcium in our diet. In order to obtain data about mineral nutrient composition of dairy products that are produced and sold in Argentina, the contents of Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Zn and Cu in whole and low fat fluid milk, dried milk and yogurt were analyzed. P was assessed by a colorimetric method, and the other elements by atomic absorption spectroscopy. In raw milk, the mineral content shows a certain degree of variability, in addition to the variability introduced by the different processing conditions, in order to meet the requirements prescribed by trade regulations and to produce dairy products. In all cases, skimming increases the concentration of mineral nutrients, which is especially remarkable in Ca contained in skimmed milk powder. In yogurt, added milk solids like dried milk or evaporated milk appreciably increase the mineral content, even more so if ultrafiltrates are used. These ultrafiltrates increase the Ca/P ratio, which probably improves Ca bioavailability.

Fluorescence analysis is suggested as a new rapid method for measuring riboflavin content in yogurt. Fluorescence landscapes with excitation wavelengths from 270 to 550 nm and emission wavelengths in the range 310 to 590 nm were obtained from front-face fluorescence measurements directly on yogurt samples during two storage experiments over a period of 5 wk at 4 degrees C. Yogurts were stored in two different packaging materials (polylactate and polystyrene) and under fluorescent light (3500 lux) or in darkness. Principal Component Analysis of unfolded fluorescence emission spectra revealed systematic changes in fluorescence signal throughout the storage period, strongly related to the storage conditions, i.e. storage time and differences in packaging materials. Correlation between fluorescence spectra and riboflavin content determined by the standard AOAC fluorometric method was evaluated using a Partial Least Square Regression model. The regression model showed a good ability to predict riboflavin in plain yogurt with a high correlation (R = 0.99) and a prediction error of 0.092 microgram riboflavin/g.

11358181,"Dioxins/furans are ubiquitous environmental contaminants whose primary route of human exposure occurs via the consumption of fatty foods of animal origin. The US FDA conducted a market basket survey of dairy products and commercial fish and shellfish to obtain data on levels of 17 dioxin/furan congeners (2, 3, 7, 8-congeners) in the US. The dairy products sampled included various cheeses (American, cheddar, Swiss, cottage), ice cream, yogurt, butter, and milk. The finfish and shellfish (molluscs and crustacea) sampled are those marine species consumed in the greatest amounts and include canned tuna, shrimp, cod, blue crab, and oysters. Catfish was sampled because it is the dominant aquaculture species. Samples were collected in 1995/96 and analysis for 17 dioxin/furan congeners was performed by high-resolution gas chromatography following extraction and clean-up. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for each congener in each food were reported. Point estimates of exposure were calculated using a 3-day (1-day diary plus 2-day recall) food consumption survey for eaters-only and for the general population (USDA/CSFII, 1989-92). Toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) were used to derive overall dioxin/furan toxicity equivalents (TEQ) for each sample food. Mean estimates of TEQ exposure for each food were derived using five values for non-detects (ND = 0; ND = 1/2 LOD or LOQ, ND = LOD or LOQ) on both a total sample and eaters-only basis. Using zero and the LOD provide lower and upper bounds on the range of estimated exposure, respectively. The bounds on mean dioxin intakes (pg/person/day) calculated for consumers of specific foods were estimated as follows (using zero or LOD for non-detects): butter (0.5-11), cheese (1.6-3.2), ice cream (4-19), yogurt (0.8-28), catfish (148-150), fish (other than catfish) (0.03-9), crustacea (32-35), mollusks (16.1-16.6), and shrimp (0.09-4.5). Exposure estimates derived by the five ND-methods are strongly dependent on the LOD and LOQ and represent upper bound estimates of exposure.

11037230,"Heat (85 degrees C for 20 min) and pressure (600 MPa for 15 min) treatments were applied to skim milk fortified by addition of whey protein concentrate. Both treatments caused > 90 % denaturation of beta-lactoglobulin. During heat treatment this denaturation took place in the presence of intact casein micelles; during pressure treatment it occurred while the micelles were in a highly dissociated state. As a result micelle structure and the distribution of beta-lactoglobulin were different in the two milks. Electron microscopy and immunolabelling techniques were used to examine the milks after processing and during their transition to yogurt gels. The disruption of micelles by high pressure caused a significant change in the appearance of the milk which was quantified by measurement of the colour values L*, a* and b*. Heat treatment also affected these characteristics. Casein micelles are dynamic structures, influenced by changes to their environment. This was clearly demonstrated by the transition from the clusters of small irregularly shaped micelle fragments present in cold pressure-treated milk to round, separate and compact micelles formed on warming the milk to 43 degrees C. The effect of this transition was observed as significant changes in the colour indicators. During yogurt gel formation, further changes in micelle structure, occurring in both pressure and heat-treated samples, resulted in a convergence of colour values. However, the microstructure of the gels and their rheological properties were very different.

10794640,"A quick headspace GC method for quantification of volatiles was developed, involving only minor sample preparation. Yogurt flavor compounds could be quantified in the micrograms per kilogram to milligrams per kilogram range without any difficulty, despite the complex matrix. Volatiles of traditional acidic and mild, less acidic yogurts were compared, and important differences were found for acetaldehyde, 2,3-butanedione, and 2,3-pentanedione. Concentrations of 2,3-butanedione and 2,3-pentanedione increased 2-3-fold in mild, less acidic yogurts compared to traditional acidic ones. This is due to accumulation of the precursors of the diketones, 2-acetolactate and 2-acetohydroxybutyrate, during fermentation in mild, less acidic yogurt. These precursors are subsequently converted to the corresponding diketones during storage. On the contrary, acetaldehyde formation was reduced in the mild yogurt, due to growth differences between the lactic acid bacteria used for fermentation of the milk.

Detection and quantification of CMP was performed by an inhibition Elisa procedure. No trace of CMP was detected in the ileum of volunteers after the ingestion of the casein meal. The results showed that CMP appears in the jejunal effluents within the first 20 min after meal ingestion at a level varying from meal to meal. During digestion of whey protein, CMP appeared rapidly as a single peak and in high amounts, whereas it is discharged slowly in moderate proportions with the casein meal. These results demonstrate that CMP is emptied from the stomach in significant amounts during milk products digestion and support the hypothesis that food-born peptides could exert a physiological function.

The highest no-effect-level (NOEL) for estrogenic activity was 80 ppm in the diet, corresponding to a daily intake of 13.3 mg F2L5250/kg. Although it is unlikely that such estrogenic tetramers would occur in commercial polystyrene, the Styrene Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) sponsored the current extensive project to address any concern that human consumption of styrene oligomers migrating from polystyrene containers into food, e.g., from packaged yoghurt, or from the use of EPS coffee cups and related products, might affect human health. To ensure confidentiality and compliance with the highest scientific and regulatory standards, the entire project was conducted without knowledge of the oligomer migrates tested, and all activities were managed and audited under a contract between the SSC and a third party, Argus International. This paper describes the preparation and analyses of the 23 representative polystyrenes [9 general purpose polystyrenes (GPPS), 8 high impact polystyrenes (HIPS) and 6 expandable polystyrenes (EPS)] evaluated for estrogenicity in an in vivo uterotrophic assay in immature female rats. The polystyrene samples were chosen to represent food packaging applications. They were obtained from participating European Polystyrene Manufacturers, coded at the TNO Nutrition and Food Research Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands (TNO) and sent to BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany for preparation of test bars (GPPS and HIPS) or test foam parts (EPS). The prepared polystyrene test bars or test foam parts were submitted to elution with 50% aqueous (v/v) ethanol for 10 days at 40 degrees C, a procedure which simulates an exposure at ambient temperature for several weeks and represents an exaggeration in comparison with yogurt, for which directive 85/572/EEC1 defines 3% aqueous acetic acid as the official food simulant. To further exaggerate the potential concentration of the possible migrates, the surface/volume ratio selected for elution was the maximum experimentally possible, i.e., approximately 56 dm2/kg food for the GPPS and HIPS bars and approximately 38 dm2/kg food for the EPS foam, representing a multiple of approximately 9 (GPPS and HIPS) and 6 (EPS), times the conventional surface/volume ratio of 6 dm2/kg. These obtained styrene oligomer migrates were then diluted to 25% aqueous (v/v) ethanol, a concentration that could be tolerated by the test animals. After dilution, the low and high concentrations represented multiples of 0.5 and 4.6 (GPPS and HIPS) and 0.5 and 3.2 (EPS) the conventional surface/volume ratio, respectively. These levels simulated daily human consumption of 500 or 5,000 g of food for the GPPS and HIPS samples and of 500 or 3,150 g of food for the EPS samples, respectively.

AFM1 was detected in 136 (86%) of the milk samples (in amounts ranging from < 1 ng/liter to 108.5 ng/liter; mean level: 10.19 ng/liter), in 81 (84%) of the dry milk samples (in amounts ranging from < 1 ng/liter to 101.3 ng/kg; mean level: 21.77 ng/kg), and in 91 (80%) of the yogurt samples (in amounts ranging from < 1 ng/liter to 496.5 ng/liter; mean level: 18.08 ng/liter). Altogether, only two samples of milk, two samples of yogurt, and one sample of dry milk had levels of AFM1 exceeding the Swiss legal limits, which are the most restrictive in the world. AFM1 contamination levels in milk and yogurt samples collected in the period of November to April were ca. four times as high as those in samples collected in the period of May to October.

Food protein value can be adversely affected by these reactions, and in particular lysine, an essential amino acid having on its side chain a free amino group, can be converted to nonbioavailable N-substituted lysine or blocked lysine. by acid hydrolysis of epsilon-deoxyketosyl compounds, furosine is formed. In this paper furosine prepared from milk-based commercial products has been evaluated by use of a recently developed HPLC method using a microbore column and phosphate buffer as the mobile phase at controlled temperature. Furosine levels have been used, together with protein, total amino acids, and lysine content, as an estimate of protein quality of a few different products such as cooked-cream dessert, yogurt mousse, white chocolate, milk chocolate, milk chocolate with a soft nougat and caramel center, milk chocolate with a whipped white center, chocolate spread, part-skim milk tablets, milk-based dietetic meals, and baby foods. The protein content of the analyzed products ranged from 34.3 gxkg(-1) (milk nougat) to 188.4 g x kg(-1) (milk tablets). The Maillard reaction caused a loss in available lysine that varied from 2.5% (cooked cream) to 36.2% (condensed milk).

The amount of folate-binding protein (FBP) was analysed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Unprocessed milk and pasteurised milk were found to contain similar amounts, 211 and 168 nmol/l, of FBP, respectively. UHT-processed milk and Yoghurt naturelle, both processed at temperatures above 90 degrees C, contained only 5.2 and 0.2 nmol/l FBP, respectively. As an indication of the protein-binding capacity free and protein-bound folates were analysed after charcoal treatment using the radio-protein binding assay method (RPBA). These results indicated that all folates in unprocessed milk and pasteurised milk were protein-bound, while folates in UHT-processed milk and Yoghurt naturelle occurred freely which is supported by our findings on FBP. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that unprocessed milk, pasteurised milk, UHT-processed milk and Yoghurt naturelle contained 44.8 +/- 2.1 (n = 10), 41.1 +/- 0.9 (n = 10), 36.1 +/- 1.8 (n = 10) and 35.6 +/- 9.1 micrograms/l (n = 10) 5-methyltetrahydrofolates (5-CH3THF), respectively, after deconjugation. Corresponding values for total milk folates analysed using radio-protein binding assay were 80.4 +/- 0.9 (n = 10), 64.2 +/- 2.7 (n = 10), 48.2 +/- 1.8 (n = 10) and 54.0 +/- 8.2 micrograms/l (n = 10), respectively. Hence, both methods indicated significant (P < 0.05) losses of 5-CH3THF as a result of pasteurisation, UHT processing and fermentation, compared with unprocessed milk. In spite of apparent discrepancies in folate concentrations obtained using the two different methods, these results support the equimolar ratio of FBP and folates in unprocessed and pasteurised milk when data on 5-CH3THF, obtained using HPLC were corrected for differences in recovery. Thus, heat processing of milk not only reduced the amount of 5-CH3 THF significantly, but also changed the concentration of FBP and the folate-binding capacity of FBP, which may have implications on the bioavailability of milk folates.",International journal of food sciences and nutrition,"['D000818', 'D002352', 'D002606', 'D002851', 'D005285', 'D058973', 'D005492', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D011956', 'D013763', 'D015014']","['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Charcoal', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fermentation', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Tetrahydrofolates', 'Yogurt']","Effect of milk processing on the concentration of folate-binding protein (FBP), folate-binding capacity and retention of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.","[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8844253,1996

The breakfast consisted of orange juice (150 mL), fruit yogurt (250 mL), two cheese sandwiches, one boiled egg, and one cup of coffee with milk and sugar. Ethanol was determined in venous blood at various times after the start of drinking by headspace gas chromatography. All subjects felt less intoxicated when alcohol was ingested after breakfast compared with drinking on an empty stomach. The peak BAC (+/- SD) was 67 +/- 9.5 mg/dL (ethanol + food) compared with 104 +/- 16.5 mg/dL when the drinking occurred after an overnight fast (P < 0.001).

The time required to metabolize the dose of ethanol was approximately two hours shorter after the subjects had eaten breakfast. These results suggest that food in the stomach before drinking not only leads to a lowering of the peak BAC and diminishes the feelings of intoxication, but also boosts the rate of ethanol metabolism.

The method also allows the determination of aspartame's major decomposition products: diketopiperazine, aspartyl-phenylalanine, and phenylalanine. Samples are extracted or diluted with water and filtered. Complex matrixes are centrifuged or clarified with Carrez solutions. An aliquot of the extract is analyzed on a reversed-phase muBondapak C18 column using 0.0125M KH2PO4 (pH 3.5)-acetonitrile ([85 + 15] or [98 + 2]) as mobile phase. Detection is performed by UV absorbance at 214 nm. Recoveries ranged from 96.1 to 105.0%. Decomposition of the sweetener was observed in most food samples. However, the total aspartame values (measured aspartame + breakdown products) were within -10% and +5% of the declared levels. The repeatabilities and the repeatability coefficients of variation were, respectively, 1.00 mg/100 g and 1.34% for products containing less than 45 mg/100 g aspartame and 4.11 mg/100 g and 0.91% for other products.
