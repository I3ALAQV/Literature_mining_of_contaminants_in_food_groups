34366473,"Groundnut oil (GNO)/peanut oil is one of the agro-food products with great economic value and hence an attractive target for adulteration and mislabeling. Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) are markers of choice for DNA fingerprinting studies as they exhibit high polymorphism due to variable number of repeats. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate and optimize a method for DNA isolation from groundnut oil and study the possibility of using the isolated DNA for molecular traceability using SSR markers. Four methods to isolate DNA from groundnut oil were evaluated. All the four methods were modified CTAB protocols, but differed in procedures for extraction, buffer compositions, amount of oil used and DNA carriers. For molecular traceability of oils, extraction and recovery of DNA from edible oil is a key step, especially in refined oils. A method that employed DNA enrichment prior to extraction with CTAB buffer yielded amplifiable DNA from cold pressed GNO, crude hexane extracted GNO and refined GNO. The optimized method for isolation of DNA from groundnut oil is simple, efficient, less costly and reproducible when compared to chromatography and spectroscopy based techniques.",Journal of food science and technology,[],[],"Evaluation of DNA extraction methods for molecular traceability in cold pressed, solvent extracted and refined groundnut oils.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366473,2021

30791635,"Diverse peanut varieties are widely cultivated in China. However, few studies have investigated the effects of germination on the phenolic profiles and antioxidant activities of specific Chinese peanut cultivars. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of germination on total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant activity, and phenolic profiles of seven peanut cultivars in China. The TPC, TFC, and antioxidant activities were determined by spectrophotometry, while phenolic profiles were analyzed by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). The results found that germination significantly increased TPC, TFC, and antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity was found to be closely related to TPC in germinated peanut extracts, which indicates that phenolics are the main contributors of antioxidants in germinated peanuts. In addition, germination induced significant changes in polyphenolic profiles. In the analyzed samples, 36 phenolic compounds were identified in which most were flavonoids. Overall, these findings highlight that germinated peanuts can be a good natural source of natural antioxidants for human consumption and functional food development.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Comparison of the Phenolic Profiles of Soaked and Germinated Peanut Cultivars via UPLC-QTOF-MS.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791635,2020

The extraction procedure based on QuEChERS followed by low-temperature freezing and dispersive cleanup steps was validated in two oil matrices for 87 pesticides of different classes. Linearity, expressed as coefficient of variation, was within the acceptable range.

Though xylanase production from lignocellulosic materials (LCMs) by solid-state fermentation (SSF) is well known, the XOS formed during growth is not recovered due to its conversion to xylose by β-xylosidase and subsequent bacterial metabolism. A new strain, Bacillus subtilis KCX006, was exceptionally found to synthesize β-xylosidase-free endo-xylanase and multiple xylan debranching enzymes constitutively in the presence of LCMs. Absence of β-xylosidase resulted in accumulation of XOS during growth of KCX006 on LCMs. Therefore, this strain was used for simultaneous production of xylanase and XOS from agro-residues in solid-state fermentation (SSF). Partial purification of XOS from culture supernatant using activated charcoal followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed xylobiose to xylotetraose formed as the major products. Among various LCM substrates, wheat bran and groundnut oil-cake supported highest xylanase and XOS production at 2158 IU/gdw and 24.92 mg/gdw, respectively.

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) ratio in a contaminated sample is generally greater than 50% of total aflatoxin (sum of aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, and G2). In Malawi, the aflatoxin occurrence ratios were determined by examining LC-MS/MS and HPLC fluorescence detection (FLD) data of 156 naturally contaminated raw maize and 80 groundnut samples collected in 2011 and 2012. Results showed that natural aflatoxin occurrence ratio differed. In 47% of the samples, the concentration of AFG1 was higher than that of AFB1.

The assay procedure involves the sequential addition of standard or sample, cleaning solutions, and aflatoxin B1-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (AFB1-HRP) over antibody-spotted zones of a membrane, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate for visualization. We have determined that trifluoroacetic acid and propionic acids at concentrations of 100 mM are highly effective for cleaning groundnut, wheat, corn, and poultry feed samples and that NaHCO3 (100 mM) is successful in cleaning processed soybean. In all cases, subsequent washing was performed with phosphate-buffered saline solution to facilitate the removal of traces of adhering interfering substances. A batch of 12 samples can be analyzed within 8 min either by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards or, more precisely, by densitometry. The method was tested for the analysis of AFB1 in groundnut, wheat, corn, processed soybean, chili, and poultry feed. The detection limit obtained was 5 microg/kg, except for chili, where it was 10 microg/kg. The average recoveries from different noninfected food samples spiked with AFB1 at concentrations of 5 to 100 microg/kg were between 99 and 105%. The values obtained for infected corn and groundnut samples correlated well with the estimates obtained by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The absence of a sample extraction step reduces the cost and labor involved in the assay. The method may be potentially applicable to the assay of other mycotoxins and environmental pollutants.",Journal of food protection,"['D016604', 'D000821', 'D010367', 'D002212', 'D002254', 'D003257', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D007118', 'D007202', 'D011422', 'D015203', 'D012680', 'D013025', 'D013997', 'D014269', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Aflatoxin B1', 'Animal Feed', 'Arachis', 'Capsicum', 'Carbonates', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Immunoassay', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Propionates', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Soybeans', 'Time Factors', 'Trifluoroacetic Acid', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']","In situ sample cleanup during immunoassay: a simple method for rapid detection of aflatoxin B, in food samples.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'pharmacology', None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', None, 'pharmacology', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'pharmacology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16245725,2005

14697037,"A simple analytical device has been developed for performing noninstrumental immunofiltration-based assay on a batch of samples. The device consists of membrane strips, with antibody-immobilized zones, attached to a polyethylene card. A moist filter paper placed between the membrane and the polyethylene card acts as the absorbent body. The device was used to estimate very low concentrations of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) present in food samples by using an improved catalyzed reporter deposition (Super-CARD) method of signal amplification involving biotinylated tyramine (B-T) and avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. 4-chloro-1-naphthol was used as the substrate for visualization. Semiquantitative results are obtained by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards. Quantitative estimation is possible by densitometric analysis (detection limit 0.25 pg/spot, 0.01 ng mL(-1)). Dilute samples can be assayed by in situ concentration with improved dose-response characteristics. A batch of 12 extracted samples can be analyzed in a single test card within 12 min. Spiked and contaminated samples of groundnut, corn, wheat, cheese, and chilli were analyzed without sample cleanup. The matrix interferences were eliminated by using appropriate dilution of the aqueous methanol extracts. Mean recoveries from different food samples were between 91 and 104%.

12661024,"Maize oil commands a premium price and is thus a target for adulteration with cheaper vegetable oils. Detection of this activity presents a particular challenge to the analyst because of the natural variability in the fatty acid composition of maize oils and because of their high sterol and tocopherol contents. This paper describes a method that allows detection of adulteration at concentrations of just 5% (m/m), based on the Mahalanobis distances of the principal component scores of the delta(13)C values of major and minor vegetable oil components. The method makes use of a database consisting of delta(13)C values and relative abundances of the major fatty acyl components of over 150 vegetable oils. The sterols and tocopherols of 16 maize oils and 6 potential adulterant oils were found to be depleted in (13)C by a constant amount relative to the bulk oil. Moreover, since maize oil contains particularly high levels of sterols and tocopherols, their delta(13)C values were not significantly altered when groundnut oil was added up to 20% (m/m) and it is possible to use the values for the minor components to predict the values that would be expected in a pure oil; therefore, comparison of the predicted values with those obtained experimentally allows adulteration to be detected. A refinement involved performing a discriminant analysis on the delta(13)C values of the bulk oil and the major fatty acids (16:0, 18:1 and 18:2) and using the Mahalanobis distances to determine the percentage of adulterant oil present. This approach may be refined further by including the delta(13)C values of the minor components in the discriminant analysis thereby increasing the sensitivity of the approach to concentrations at which adulteration would not be attractive economically.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D002247', 'D003314', 'D005227', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D012680', 'D013261', 'D024505', 'D003313']","['Carbon Isotopes', 'Corn Oil', 'Fatty Acids', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sterols', 'Tocopherols', 'Zea mays']",High-resolution detection of adulteration of maize oil using multi-component compound-specific delta13C values of major and minor components and discriminant analysis.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12661024,2003
