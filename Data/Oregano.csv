35293514,"Increasing the rates of drug resistant bacteria, having adverse effects and also high costs of antibiotics lead to essential oils (EOs) with antibacterial properties have gained importance. The present study was predicted to evaluate antibacterial activity of cinnamon, lavender, tea tree, lemon, coconut, oregano, mint, laurel and eucalyptus EOs alone and in combination. Chemical components of effective EOs were examined through gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assays were used to identify antibacterial effects of EOs against bacterial strains. The Fractional Inhibitory Concentration index (FICI) of the binary combinations of EOs was determined by checkerboard method. Carvacrol, linalool, linalyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, cinnamaldehyde, terpinen-4-ol and p-cymene were found main components of EOs. Oregano, cinnamon and tea tree EOs exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity with the MIC range between 0.03125-1.00% (v/v). Tea tree/lavender and cinnamon/lavender mixtures showed a synergistic effect against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Oregano with tea tree and laurel exhibited a synergistic effect against Staphylococcus aureus.

34829641,"Culinary spices and herbs have been used to impart a characteristic flavour and aroma in food due to their appealing fragrance. Recently, bioactive compounds from herbs, especially phenolics, have gained much attention due to their potential health outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize and quantify the phenolic compounds from 10 widely used Australian-grown herbs (oregano, rosemary, bay, basil, sage, fenugreek, dill, parsley, mint and thyme). For this purpose, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for the complete profiling of polyphenolic compounds and quantification of abundant phenolic compounds was completed with high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA). Polyphenols from Australian-grown herbs were estimated through total phenolic content (TP), total flavonoids (TF) and total tannins (TT) along with their in-vitro antioxidant activities. Oregano and mint were estimated with the highest value of TP (140.59 ± 9.52 and 103.28 ± 8.08 mg GAE/g, milligram gallic acid equivalent/gram) while rosemary and mint had the highest TF (8.19 ± 0.74 and 7.05 ± 0.43 mg QE (quercetin equivalent)/g). In this study, eighty-four (84) phenolic compounds were screened and confirmed through LC-MS/MS by comparing their masses and fragmentation pattern with published libraries.

34753973,"Nine odorless laboratory-collected hydro-distilled aqueous extracts (basil, calendula, centrifuged oregano, corn silk, laurel, oregano, rosemary, spearmint, thyme) and one industrial steam-distilled oregano hydrolate acquired as by-products of essential oils purification were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against three Salmonella Typhimurium strains (4/74, FS8, FS115) at 4 and 37 °C. Susceptibility to the extracts was mainly plant- and temperature-dependent, though strain dependent effects were also observed. Industrial oregano hydrolate eliminated strains immediately after inoculation, exhibiting the highest antimicrobial potential. Hydro-distilled extracts eliminated/reduced Salmonella levels during incubation at 4 °C. At 37 °C, oregano, centrifuged oregano, thyme, calendula and basil were bactericidal while spearmint, rosemary and corn silk bacteriostatic. A strain-dependent effect was observed for laurel. The individual or combined effect of marinades and edible coatings prepared of industrial hydrolate and hydro-distilled oregano extracts with or without oregano essential oil (OEO) was tested in pork meat at 4 °C inoculated with FS8 strain. Lower in situ activity was observed compared to in vitro assays. Marinades and edible coatings prepared of industrial oregano hydrolate + OEO were the most efficient in inhibiting pathogen. Marination in oregano extract and subsequent coating with either 50% oregano extract + OEO or water + OEO enhanced the performance of oregano extract.

33714458,"Nowadays, most of the screening methods in food manufacturing are based on spectroscopic techniques. Ambient Mass Spectrometry is a relatively new field of analytical chemistry which has proven to offer similar speed and ease-of-use when compared to other fingerprinting techniques, alongside the advantages of good selectivity, sensitivity and chemical information. Numerous applications have been explored in food authenticity, based either on the target detection of adulteration markers or, less frequently, on the development of multivariate classification models. The aim of the present work was to evaluate and compare the capabilities of Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) and Atmospheric Solid Analysis Probe (ASAP) Mass Spectrometry (MS) for the high-throughput authenticity screening of commercial herbs and spices products. The gross addition of bulking material to dried Mediterranean oregano was taken as case study. First, a pilot sample set, constituted by authentic dried oregano, olive leaves (a frequently reported adulterant) and mixtures thereof at different levels (i.e. 10, 20, 30 and 50% w/w) was used. Each sample was fingerprinted by both ambient-MS techniques. After appropriate pre-processing, the whole mass spectra were used for the subsequent multivariate data analysis. Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy was adopted as classification algorithm and the model was challenged with both new authentic oregano and in-house prepared blends. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of DART-MS and ASAP-MS used in full scan mode and coupled to chemometric modelling as rapid fingerprinting approach for food authentication. Although both the techniques provided satisfactory results, ASAP-MS clearly showed greater potential, leading to reproducible, diagnostic feature-rich mass spectra. For this reason, ASAP-MS was further tested under a more convoluted scenario, where the training and validation sets were enlarged with additional authentic oregano samples and a wider range of adulterant species, respectively. Overall good results were achieved, with 93% model predictive accuracy, and screening detection capability estimated between 5-20% (w/w) addition, depending on the adulterant considered with the only exception of majorana. Investigation of Q residuals could highlight the statistically-relevant chemical markers which could be tentatively annotated by coupling the ASAP probe with a high resolution mass analyser. The results from the validation study confirmed the great potential of ASAP-MS in combination with chemometrics as fast MS-based screening solution and demonstrated its feasibility for classification model building.",Talanta,"['D004340', 'D005506', 'D013058', 'D031341', 'D017365']","['Drug Contamination', 'Food Contamination', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Origanum', 'Spices']",Critical evaluation of ambient mass spectrometry coupled with chemometrics for the early detection of adulteration scenarios in Origanum vulgare L.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33714458,2021

32474229,"To control Pseudomonas and Shewanella as important psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria in fish meat, we used ethanolic extracts of oregano (Origanum vulgare subsp. vulgare) and nettle (Urtica dioica), with phytochemical characterisation of the extracts and their bioactive compounds. Liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detection and electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry was used for qualitative compositional determination of the extracts. Four main compounds were identified in the oregano extract, with rosmarinic acid the most abundant, followed by three glycosylated phenolics, one of which is reported for the first time in O. vulgare: 4'-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-3',4'-dihydroxybenzyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. Six main compounds were identified in the nettle extract, as caffeoylmalic acid and five flavonoid glycosides. These oregano and nettle ethanolic extracts showed in-vitro antimicrobial activities against selected Pseudomonas and Shewanella strains in broth and fish meat homogenate when evaluated at two inoculum concentrations. The antimicrobial activities were more pronounced for the nettle extract at the lower inoculum concentration, and for both the Shewanella strains. Growth inhibition in the fish meat homogenate was evaluated at 3.13 mg/mL and 1.56 mg/mL at 5 °C. Again, the nettle extract showed greater antimicrobial activity, which was seen as the lowest maximum growth rate, followed by the oregano extract, which was inhibitory only at 3.13 mg/mL.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of potentially toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in spices marketed in Brazil. The fungal contamination was evaluated by direct plating for samples of clove, black and white peppers. Spread plate was used for the samples of rosemary, cinnamon, fennel, pepperoni pepper and oregano. Analyses were performed in triplicate in DG18 media with incubation at 25°C for 7days. The isolation and identification of fungi followed specific recommendations of culture media and incubation period for each genus. The presence of mycotoxins in spices was verified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to fluorescence. The frequency of species potentially toxigenic was high in white and black peppers with presence of both aflatoxigenic and ochratoxigenic fungi. Only rosemary and fennel showed contamination with aflatoxin B1 and there was a positive correlation (ρ<0.01) between the rosemary contamination with the presence of AFB1 and A. flavus. Even in the presence of ochratoxigenic fungi, ochratoxin A was not detected in the samples. The presence of natural components with antimicrobial activity could justify the low presence of mycotoxins, even in the presence of known toxigenic fungi in the samples.

Seven culinary spices including black pepper, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, ginger, Mediterranean oregano, rosemary, and turmeric were extracted with boiling water. Major chemical constituents were characterized by RP-HPLC-DAD method and antioxidant capacity was determined by measuring colorimetrically the extent to scavenge ABTS radical cations. Effects of spice extracts on the viability of 88 anaerobic and facultative isolates from intestinal microbiota were determined by using Brucella agar plates containing serial dilutions of extracts. A total of 14 phenolic compounds, a piperine, cinnamic acid, and cinnamaldehyde were identified and quantitated. Spice extracts exhibited high antioxidant capacity that correlated with the total amount of major chemicals. All spice extracts, with the exception of turmeric, enhanced the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. All spices exhibited inhibitory activity against selected Ruminococcus species.

27783121,"One critical challenge when developing a new antimicrobial packaging material is to demonstrate the mode of action of the antimicrobials incorporated into the packaging. For this task, several analytical techniques as well as microbiology are required. In this work, the antimicrobial properties of benzyl isothiocyanate, allyl isothiocyanate and essential oils of cinnamon and oregano against several moulds and bacteria have been evaluated. Benzyl isothiocyanate showed the highest antimicrobial activity and it was selected for developing the new active packaging material. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were successfully used to demonstrate the mode of action of benzyl isothiocyanate on Escherichia coli. Bacteria exhibited external modifications such as oval shape and the presence of septum surface, but they did not show any disruption or membrane damage. To provide data on the in vitro action of benzyl isothiocyanate and the presence of inhibition halos, the transfer mechanism to the cells was assessed using solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Based on the transfer system, action mechanism and its stronger antimicrobial activity, benzyl isothiocyanate was incorporated to two kinds of antimicrobial labels. The labels were stable and active for 140 days against two mould producers of ochratoxin A; Penicillium verrucosum is more sensitive than Aspergillus ochraceus. Details about the analytical techniques and the results obtained are shown and discussed.

Both herbs and spices fit these criteria perfectly and yet strategies to detect fraudulent adulteration are still far from robust. An FT-IR screening method coupled to data analysis using chemometrics and a second method using LC-HRMS were developed, with the latter detecting commonly used adulterants by biomarker identification. The two tier testing strategy was applied to 78 samples obtained from a variety of retail and on-line sources.

Amaranth, chitosan and starch edible films were formulated with essential oil concentrations of 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 2.00, or 4.00%. Antifungal activity was evaluated by determining the mold radial growth on agar media inoculated with A. niger and P. digitatum after exposure to vapors arising from essential oils added to amaranth, chitosan or starch films using the inverted lid technique. The modified Gompertz model adequately described mold growth curves (mean coefficient of determination 0.991 ± 0.05). Chitosan films exhibited better antifungal effectiveness (inhibition of A. niger with 0.25% of Mexican oregano and cinnamon EO; inhibition of P. digitatum with 0.50% EOs) than amaranth films (2.00 and 4.00% of cinnamon and Mexican oregano EO were needed to inhibit the studied molds, respectively). For chitosan and amaranth films a significant increase (p<0.05) of lag phase was observed among film concentrations while a significant decrease (p<0.05) of maximum specific growth was determined. Chitosan edible films incorporating Mexican oregano or cinnamon essential oil could improve the quality of foods by the action of the volatile compounds on surface growth of molds.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D027721', 'D000935', 'D001234', 'D048271', 'D002935', 'D005503', 'D005506', 'D018857', 'D005520', 'D032411', 'D008826', 'D009822', 'D010407', 'D010938', 'D010968', 'D013213', 'D013729', 'D014835']","['Amaranthus', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Aspergillus niger', 'Chitosan', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum', 'Food Additives', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Packaging', 'Food Preservatives', 'Lippia', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Penicillium', 'Plant Oils', 'Plasticizers', 'Starch', 'Terpenes', 'Volatilization']","Antifungal activity by vapor contact of essential oils added to amaranth, chitosan, or starch edible films.","[None, 'Q000494', 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000517', None, None, None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000187', 'Q000494', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', None, None, 'pharmacology', 'prevention & control', None, None, None, None, 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22100789,2012

For comparison purposes, they were arranged in groups as C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, and Candida non-albicans. The essential oils were obtained from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Breyn, Lippia graveolens HBK, Ocimum basilicum L., Origanum vulgare L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Salvia officinalis L., Thymus vulgaris L., and Zingiber officinale. The susceptibility tests were based on the M27-A2 methodology. The chemical composition of the essential oils was obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and by retention indices. The results showed that cinnamon, Mexican oregano, oregano, thyme, and ginger essential oils have different levels of antifungal activity. Oregano and ginger essential oils were found to be the most and the least efficient, respectively. The main finding was that the susceptibilities of fluconazole-resistant C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, and Candida non-albicans to Mexican oregano, oregano, thyme, and ginger essential oils were higher than those of the fluconazole-susceptible yeasts (P<0.05). In contrast, fluconazole-resistant C. albicans and Candida non-albicans were less susceptible to cinnamon essential oil than their fluconazole-susceptible counterparts (P<0.05).

18096925,"The aim of this experiment was to study the effect of the addition, to milk, of an essential oil (EO) obtained from the hydrodistillation of plants collected from a mountain natural pasture on the milk and cheese sensory properties. The EO was mainly composed of terpenoid compounds (67 of the 95 compounds identified) as well as ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, alkanes, and benzenic compounds. In milk, the addition of this EO at the concentration of 0.1 microL/L did not influence its sensory properties, whereas at 1.0 microL/L, sensory properties were modified. In cheeses, the effect of adding EO into milk was studied in an experimental dairy plant allowing the production of small Cantal-type cheeses (10 kg) in 3 vats processed in parallel. The control (C) vat contained 110 L of raw milk; in the other 2 vats, 0.1 microL/L (EO1) or 3.0 microL/L (EO30) of EO were added to 110 L of the same milk. Six replicates were performed. After 5 mo of ripening, chemical and sensory analyses were carried out on the cheeses, including determination of the volatile compounds by dynamic headspace combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The EO did not influence the sensory properties of the cheeses at the lower concentration (EO1). However, the EO30 cheeses had a more intense odor and aroma, both characterized as ""mint/chlorophyll"" and ""thyme/oregano."" These unusual odors and aromas originated directly from the EO added. In total, 152 compounds desorbing from cheese were found, of which 41 had been added with the EO; in contrast, 54 compounds of the EO were not recovered in the cheese. Few volatile compounds desorbing from cheeses, other than the added compounds, were affected by EO addition. Among them, 2-butanol, propanol, and 3-heptanone suggested a slight effect of the EO on lipid catabolism.

Films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the Gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria. PP films were more effective than PE/EVOH films. The atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside Petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (HS-SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analyses showed that the oregano-fortified PP films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified PP films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding PE/EVOH films. Shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. In addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet EU regulations regarding food contact materials.

For this purpose the antimicrobial activity of the active packaging containing cinnamon or oregano was evaluated against E. coli and S. aureus. The vapour phase activity and the direct contact between the antimicrobial agents themselves, or once incorporated in the packaging material, and the microbial cells have been studied. The direct contact was studied using a broth dilution method. The vapour phase was evaluated by using a new method which involves the use of a filter disk containing the EOs. Furthermore, the kill time assay was used to determine the exposure time for the maximum efficiency in packaging, and transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the antimicrobial activity and the possible mechanism of action against E. coli and S. aureus. Finally, the compounds absorbed by cells were identified. The results showed that the techniques used provide relevant information about the antibacterial activity of cinnamon and oregano in direct contact as well as in the vapour phase. The antimicrobial packaging showed a fast efficiency which supports its likely application as a food packaging material. Bacteria treated with EOs exhibit a wide range of significant abnormalities; these include formation of blebs, coagulation of cytoplasmatic constituents, collapse of the cell structure and lack of cytoplasmatic material.

17488023,"The aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. In a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (EOs)-cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and oregano (Origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis), molds (Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (Candida albicans). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were generally lower for oregano EO than for the thyme and cinnamon EOs, especially against the relatively resistant Gram-negative. The persistence of the EOs' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (PCA). More relevant chemicals were selected. In addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (S. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (A. flavus), and a yeast (C. albicans). Of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their MICs, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. To check for possible interactions between components present in the EOs, cinnamon EO was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme EO with thymol, and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified EOs using fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. Synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on A. flavus and for thymol on L. monocytogenes, S. choleraesuis, and A. flavus. In all other cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against S. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic.

Clove oil (eugenol) was the most inhibitory to the growth of A. parasiticus and F. moniliforme, followed by cinnamon (cinnamic aldehyde), oregano (thymol and carvacol) and mace oils (myristin). Neem and eucalyptus oil (cineole) did not affect fungal growth. The feasibility of implementing the results of this study to control mycotoxin toxicity was examined by costoring whole and ground cloves with mycotoxin-infected grain. Addition of both whole and ground cloves markedly reduced the aflatoxin contamination of the grain. These results clearly suggest that commonly occurring mycotoxigenic fungi can be controlled with clove oil (eugenol), thus spice oil successfully inhibited the growth of A. parasiticus and F. moniliforme, regulated the production of fumonisins. and prevented the formation of aflatoxins. The social implication of this finding is that rural communities can prevent the formation of fungal toxins in contaminated grain by simple measures.",Journal of food protection,"['D001230', 'D005054', 'D005511', 'D005516', 'D005670', 'D009183', 'D010938', 'D017365']","['Aspergillus', 'Eugenol', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fusarium', 'Mycotoxins', 'Plant Oils', 'Spices']",Spice oils for the control of co-occurring mycotoxin-producing fungi.,"['Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000096', 'Q000494', None]","['drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'methods', None, 'drug effects', 'biosynthesis', 'pharmacology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11952220,2002
