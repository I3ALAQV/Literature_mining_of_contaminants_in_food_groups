35324831,"Various analytical techniques for detecting mycotoxins have been developed in order to control their concentration in food and feed. Conventional analytical approaches for mycotoxin identification include thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography (GC). Rapid methods for mycotoxin analysis are also becoming increasingly relevant. One of the most common rapid methods for determining these compounds is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The current study aimed to compare three available ELISA kits for the detection and quantification of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 in spiked feed samples at known quantities. All three ELISA kits were validated and showed good performance with high recovery rates and LOD and LOQ values lower than the MRL. The developed HPLC-FL method was validated for all the compounds determining the accuracy, precision, linearity, decision limit, and detection capability with fairly good results. Unknown feed samples (corn, silage, pellet, barley, wheat, soya, and sunflower) were also tested using the best ELISA kit and HPLC, and the results were compared. Both ELISA and HPLC were proven to be suitable methods for mycotoxin analysis. The analytical technique should be determined primarily by the availability and number of samples.",Veterinary sciences,[],[],"Comparative Evaluation of Three Commercial Elisa Kits Used for the Detection of Aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 in Feedstuffs and Comparison with an HPLC Method.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35324831,2022
35248864,"We present an easy-to-use lateral flow immunoassay for rapid, precise and sensitive quantification of one of the most hazardous mycotoxins - ochratoxin A (OTA), which is widely present in food and agricultural commodities. The achieved limit of detection during the 20-min OTA registration is 11 pg/mL. The assay provides accurate results in both low- and high-concentration ranges. That is due to the extraordinary steepness of the linear calibration plot: 5-order dynamic range of concentrations causes almost a 1000-fold change in the signal obtained by electronic detection of magnetic biolabels using their non-linear magnetization. High specificity, repeatability, and reproducibility of the assay have been verified, including measuring OTA in real samples of contaminated corn flour. The developed assay is a promising analytical tool for food and feed safety control; it may become an express, convenient and high-precision alternative to the traditional sophisticated laboratory techniques based on liquid chromatography.",Food chemistry,[],[],Express high-sensitive detection of ochratoxin A in food by a lateral flow immunoassay based on magnetic biolabels.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35248864,2022

This study investigated composition of carotenoids in hairless canary seed (HCS) as a novel food and the effect of baking on carotenoids in bread and muffin made from HCS, wheat and corn. Three bread formulations made from wheat and HCS blends were evaluated and compared with control wheat bread. In addition, three low-fat muffin recipes prepared from HCS alone or in blends with corn were assessed. The fate of carotenoid compounds in breads and muffins was monitored after dry mixing, dough/batter formation and oven baking. Carotenoids in products were quantified using UPLC and their identification was confirmed based on LC-MS/MS. Hairless canary seed and corn were fairly rich in carotenoids with a total content of 7.6 and 12.9 µg/g, respectively, compared with wheat (1.3 µg/g).

35202122,"An immunoaffinity magnetic beads (IMBs) based automatic pretreatment method was developed for the quantitative analysis of deoxynivalenol (DON) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet detector (UPLC-UV). First, N-hydroxysuccinimide-terminated magnetic beads (NHS-MBs) with good magnetic responsivity and dispersibility were synthesized and characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and laser diffraction-based particle size analyzer. Then, the amino groups of anti-DON monoclonal antibody (mAb) and the NHS groups of NHS-MBs were linked by covalent bonds to prepare IMB, without any activation reagent. The essential factors affecting the binding and elution of DON were meticulously tuned. Under optimal conditions, DON could be extracted from a real sample and eluted from IMB by water, enabling environmentally friendly and green analysis. Hence, there was no need for dilution or evaporation prior to UPLC-UV analysis. DON in 20 samples could be purified and concentrated within 30 min by the mycotoxin automated purification instrument (MAPI), allowing for automated, green, high-throughput and simple clean-up. Recoveries at four distinct spiking levels in corn and wheat ranged from 92.0% to 109.5% with good relative standard deviations (RSD, 2.1-7.0%).

35169269,"Novel Immunological and Mass Spectrometry Methods for Comprehensive Analysis of Recalcitrant Oligosaccharides in AFEX Pretreated Corn Stover. Lignocellulosic biomass is a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel and is extensively used for developing bio-based technologies to produce products such as food, feed, fuel, and chemicals. The key to these technologies is to develop cost competitive processes to convert complex carbohydrates present in plant cell wall to simple sugars such as glucose, xylose, and arabinose. Since lignocellulosic biomass is highly recalcitrant, it must undergo a combination of thermochemical treatment such as Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX), dilute acid (DA), Ionic Liquid (IL) and biological treatment such as enzyme hydrolysis and microbial fermentation to produce desired products. However, when using commercial fungal enzymes during hydrolysis, only 75-85% of the soluble sugars generated are monomeric sugars, while the remaining 15-25% are soluble recalcitrant oligosaccharides that cannot be easily utilized by microorganisms. Previously, we successfully separated and purified the soluble recalcitrant oligosaccharides using a combination of charcoal and celite-based separation followed by size exclusion chromatography and studies their inhibitory properties on enzymes. We discovered that the oligosaccharides with higher degree of polymerization (DP) containing methylated uronic acid substitutions were more recalcitrant towards commercial enzyme mixtures than lower DP and neutral oligosaccharides. Here, we report the use of several complementary techniques that include glycome profiling using plant biomass glycan specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to characterize sugar linkages in plant cell walls and enzymatic hydrolysate, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) using structurally-informative diagnostic peaks offered by negative ion post-secondary decay spectra, gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to characterize oligosaccharide sugar linkages with and without derivatization. Since oligosaccharides (DP 4-20) are small, it is challenging to mobilize these molecules for mAbs binding and characterization. To overcome this problem, we have applied a new biotin-coupling based oligosaccharide immobilization method that successfully tagged most of the low DP soluble oligosaccharides on to a micro-plate surface followed by specific linkage analysis using mAbs in a high-throughput system. This new approach will help develop more advanced versions of future high throughput glycome profiling methods that can be used to separate and characterize oligosaccharides present in biomarkers for diagnostic applications.",Scientific reports,"['D000911', 'D018533', 'D001710', 'D002236', 'D002473', 'D002850', 'D004797', 'D000939', 'D008401', 'D006868', 'D008031', 'D009844', 'D010936', 'D018515', 'D019032', 'D000073893', 'D003313']","['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biomass', 'Biotin', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cell Wall', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrolysis', 'Lignin', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Leaves', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Sugars', 'Zea mays']",Understanding the structure and composition of recalcitrant oligosaccharides in hydrolysate using high-throughput biotin-based glycome profiling and mass spectrometry.,"['Q000276', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000276', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['immunology', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'methods', 'immunology', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35169269,2022
35124380,"Maize and grass silages are important dietary components for ruminant livestock that influence the quality of animal products for human consumption, such as milk, in many parts of the world. Infection of plants by fungi able to produce mycotoxins, either in the field or post-harvest, can result in a decrease of silage nutritional quality and, consequently, in milk quality. In this study, 45 maize and grass silage samples were collected from 25 dairy farms located in the north of Portugal. The occurrence of fungi was evaluated in samples, the most frequently isolated species being Aspergillus fumigatus, Dipodascus geotrichum, Mucor circinelloides, Penicillium paneum, and Aspergillus flavus. The mycotoxigenic profile of the fungal species was studied using the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry-ion trap-time-of-flight (UHPLC-MS-IT-TOF) detection. In addition, a new method based on a QuEChERS extraction followed by the UHPLC- tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) detection was developed for simultaneous analysis of 39 mycotoxins in silage. A high co-occurrence of Fusarium mycotoxins was found, although at low levels of contamination. Deoxynivalenol and beauvericin were found in more than 82% of maize silage samples.

Therefore, risk assessment from agricultural products in these areas was crucial to ensure the health of customers. However, the effects of geological background on distributions of heavy metals and their accumulation in plant remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the distributions of mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) in 1036 corn and rice samples collected from 9 locations in Guizhou province and to evaluate their health risks. The concentrations of Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Cr and Cu in these two crops were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and their health risk were estimated by the target risk quotient approaches. Results showed that the mean concentrations of Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Cr and Cu in corn and rice were 0.01, 0.07, 0.06, 0.27, 0.56 and 1.86 mg/kg which were lower than their respective maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) of 0.02, 0.20, 0.70, 0.20, 0.50 and 10.00 mg/kg except Pb and Cr. The concentrations of Cr and Cu in corn were higher than in rice while Cd, As and Pb in rice were higher than in corn. Moreover, the distributions of Hg, Cd and Cu in corn and rice samples were mainly observed from QDN located at southeast of Guizhou province while Pb, As and Cr were most detected at ZY, QXN and BJ areas, southwest zone. The hazard indices (HIs) values for corn and rice were 0.20 and 2.61. The high HIs (> 1) in rice indicated that the health risk of heavy metals in rice was relatively high and Pb was the major component that attributed to the risk, followed by Cd. These results could provide a reference for the distributions of heavy metals in agricultural products in Guizhou province under crop cultivation conditions, and to provide scientific basis for health risk assessment and ensure food safety.",Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,[],[],Distributions of Heavy Metals in Rice and Corn and Their Health Risk Assessment in Guizhou Province.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35088098,2022
34954830,"Ingredient interactions usually occur in food matrix, which may affect their functions and properties. This study aimed to investigate the interactive effects of mulberry and corn protein on pigment stability and zein digestibility. The interaction of main compounds in both ingredients, that is, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) and zein, was characterized via their structural, morphological, thermal stability, and digestible properties using multi-spectroscopic techniques, scanning electron microscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, and in vitro digestion models. Results showed that zein exhibited a strong binding affinity for C3G via van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds determined in fluorescence assays. The secondary structure of zein changed due to C3G binding, with a decrease in α-helix and an increase in β-sheet. The particle size of zein decreased after interacting with C3G. The zein complexation with mulberry anthocyanin-rich extracts in a simulative food system did not affect the digestibility of zein significantly but enhanced the thermal stability of pigments slightly. Specifically, anthocyanins did not change the susceptibility of zein to pepsin proteolysis, suggesting that binding sites of C3G might not be the cleavage sites of pepsins. These results provide important insight into the binding mechanism of zein and anthocyanins and might help guide the design of anthocyanin-based functional food. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Zein, as a storage protein widely distributed in corn flour, was commonly co-existing with anthocyanins in starchy food. This study provides insights into the molecular interactions between zein and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. However, the interaction might not impact the zein digestion but enhance anthocyanin thermal stability.

Nevertheless, although these compounds have extensively been studied in food and feed, only little is known about their occurrence and fate in soil and agro-environmental matrices, such as manure, sewage sludge, drainage water and sediments. Therefore, the aim of this review was to (i) resume available methods for quantifying mycotoxins in soil, (ii) describe the occurrence and quantities of mycotoxins in soil and related agro-environmental matrices, and (iii) discuss the environmental fate of these target compounds with specific focus on their leaching potential into groundwater.

34944482,"Zein is a type of prolamin storage protein that has a variety of biomedical and industrial applications. Due to the considerable genetic variability and polyploidity of the starting material, as well as the extraction methods used, the characterization of the protein composition of zein requires a combination of different analytical processes. Therefore, we combined modern analytical methods such as mass spectrometry (MS), Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), atomic force microscopy (AFM), or Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) for a better characterization of the extracted zein. In this study, we present an enhanced eco-friendly extraction method, including grinding and sieving corn seeds, for prolamins proteins using an ultrasonic extraction methodology. The use of an ultrasonic homogenizer, 65% ethanol extraction buffer, and 710 µm maize granulation yielded the highest protein extraction from all experimental conditions we employed. An SDS PAGE analysis of the extracted zein protein mainly revealed two intense bands of approximatively 20 and 23 kDa, suggesting that the extracted zein was mostly α-zein monomer. Additionally, MS analysis revealed as a main component the α-zein PMS2 (Uniprot accession no. P24450) type protein in the maize flour extract. Moreover, AFM studies show that extracting zein with a 65% ethanol and a 710 µm granulation yields a homogeneous content that could allow these proteins to be employed in future medical applications.

Furthermore, the resulting measurements performed under harsh tropical conditions (up to 38.4 °C and 91% relative humidity) in SSA, specifically Burkina Faso and Mozambique, were compared with the results from a well-established and validated LC-MS/MS-based reference method. The comparison of the on-site LFD results with the reference method showed a good agreement: 86.4% agreement, 11.8% non-agreement, and 1.8% invalid test results. To test the robustness of the cutoff tests, short- and long-term stability testing was carried out in Mozambique and Nigeria. For both experiments, no loss of test performance could be determined.

Due to the fact that pigmented corn flours contain biologically active and health-promoting phenolic and anthocyanin compounds, the objective of this study was to potentially define beneficial properties of flatbread by evaluating the acrylamide content determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) with a detection limit of 1.8 µg/kg and proximate composition by standard methods of six experimental flatbreads made from two white, two blue, one red, and one yellow corn flours obtained by milling commercial seeds. Acrylamide content was also determined in experimental flatbreads made from combinations in quinoa flour, wheat flour, and peanut meal with added broccoli or beet vegetables and of commercial flatbreads including tortillas and wraps. Proximate analysis of flatbreads showed significant differences in protein and fat but not in carbohydrate, mineral, and water content. The acrylamide content of 16 evaluated flatbreads ranged from 0 to 49.1 µg/kg, suggesting that these flatbreads have the potential to serve as low-acrylamide functional foods.

34600685,"Food authenticity relies on genuineness and reliability according to the information displayed on the package. Since the 18th century, when coffee became popularized in the West, adulteration began. Several methods have been developed to detect different kinds of frauds and they have evolved as demands increased and new technologies were introduced. The evolution of the science of coffee authenticity control in the past three centuries is reviewed, focusing on the discrimination between coffee and other foods or between coffee and its by-products. The earliest chemical and physical methods are presented followed by methods developed in the 20th and 21st centuries using microscopy, chromatography and spectroscopy associated with advanced statistical tools, and DNA-based methods. In addition to non-food material, before the 20th century, chicory was the most studied food-adulterant. From the 20th century on, corn, coffee by-products, and barley were the most studied, followed by chicory, rice and other food items. Matrix effects seem to be among the most challenging problems in these approaches, associated with variations in roast degree, particle size (particularly in spectroscopy-based methods), and lack of control over reference samples regarding species and purity. Limits of detection vary considerably within each category, with most limits being too high for commercial use. DNA-based methods appear to be promising to assess coffee authenticity, given that the limits of detection and quantification are low, and specificity is higher than in other methods. Nevertheless, as roast intensity increases, the sensitivity of the method decreases. So far, most reported methods have not been validated and only a few have been tested on commercial brands, except for those involving microscopy which has been highly used for monitoring coffee authenticity although not always efficiently enough.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D003069', 'D005506', 'D005607', 'D015203', 'D003313']","['Coffee', 'Food Contamination', 'Fraud', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Zea mays']",Three centuries on the science of coffee authenticity control.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600685,2021

This study aimed to investigate the impact of two potential NSLAB in Cheddar cheesemaking: Lactiplantibacillus plantarum RKG 2-212 a strain isolated both in corn silage and raw milk, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii RKG R10, a strain isolated after pasteurisation of milk from a farm using grass and legume silage, and corn silage. The whole genome of these two lactobacilli was first sequenced. Then, the thermoresistance was evaluated after treatment at 60 °C for 5 min and compared to reference strains. Both lactobacilli were highly thermoresistant compared to other three lactic acid bacteria which are Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris ATCC 19257 and SK11, and L. plantarum ATCC 14917 (P < 0.0001). They lost less than 1 log cfu/mL (Δlog) and their genome contained a great number of copy number of genes coding for heat shock protein. During a Pearce test activity simulating Cheddar cheesemaking, the two lactobacilli did not show interaction with the starter Lcc. lactis subsp. cremoris SK11, and their population remained stable. During a ripening simulation, L. delbrueckii RKG R10 had a slight loss in viability in cheese slurry samples incubated at 30 °C for 12 d. However, L. plantarum RKG 2-212 had considerable growth, from 6.51 to 8.3 log cfu/g. This growth was associated with the acidification of the slurries (P < 0.0001). The presence of the lactobacilli modified the profile of volatile compounds evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, accounting for 10.7% of the variation.

Previously it was considered to be one species occurring on all continents. However, phylogenetic analysis employing the GCPSR method (Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition) revealed the existence of 15 phylogenetic species within what is now recognised as the Fusarium graminearum Species Complex (FGSC) (Sarver et al. 2011). During 1996-2008, a MRIZP collection of FGSC isolates was established and isolates originating from wheat (5), maize (3) and barely (2) were selected for further study. Morphological features including the appearance of colonies and macroconidia (average size 38.5-53.1 × 4.6-5.4 µm, No 50) of all 10 isolates on PDA were consistent with descriptions of F. graminearum (O'Donnell et al. 2004, Leslie and Summerell 2006). Total DNA was isolated from mycelium removed from 7-day old colonies of single-spore isolates grown on PDA using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden). Further identification was based on amplification and sequencing of elongation factor TEF-1α, histone H3 and β-tubulin in both directions, with primers ef1/ef2, H3-1a/H3-1b and T1/T22, respectively (Jacobs et al. 2010). The sequences were deposited in NCBI under accession numbers MF974399 - MF974408 (TEF-1α), MG063783 - MG063792 (β-tubulin) and MF999139 - MF999148 (histone H3). Sequence analysis was performed using BLAST while genetic similarity was calculated using MEGA 6.0 software. Isolate 1339 originating from wheat (collected at the locality of Kikinda in 2006), shared 100% nucleotide identity with TEF-1α (DQ459745), histone H3 (DQ459728) and β-tubulin (DQ459643) of F. vorosii isolate NRRL37605 (Starkey et al. 2007). The remaining nine isolates were identified as F. graminearum as they shared 99% to 100% nucleotide similarity with F. graminearum NRRL 28439 (O'Donnell et al. 2004). Pathogenicity was tested using artificial inoculations of spikes during wheat flowering (Mesterhazy et al. 1999). Thirty classes were inoculated with each isolate, in three replicates. Inoculum was prepared from 7-day colonies on PDA, and 30 ml of a conidia suspension (1x105 conidia/ml) was used. Control plants were inoculated with sterile water. Three weeks after inoculation, typical Fusarium head blight symptoms were visible on inoculated plants, from which all 10 isolates were successfully reisolated. Control spikes remained symptomless. Disease severity was estimated on the 1-7 scale (Blandino et al. 2012). Average pathogenicity of the F. vorosii isolate 1339 was 1.9, and 2.4 -5.1 of F. graminearum isolates. Toxin production was determined using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Kernels inoculated with the 10 isolates were ground and tested for the presence of deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetyl derivatives 3ADON, 15ADON and NIV. F. vorosii isolate 1339 possessed the 15ADON chemotype, as well as eight F. graminearum isolates, while only one F. graminearum isolate was 3ADON chemotype. To date, F. vorosii has only been detected in Hungary on wheat (Toth et al. 2005) and Korea on barley, corn and rice (Lee et al. 2016).

34029958,"A statewide assessment of neonicotinoids in groundwater was conducted among a sample of public water supply wells in Iowa from October 2017 to August 2018. Samples from all the state's major aquifer groups were initially collected from 118 wells in 69 counties. Subsets of 55 untreated samples and 45 paired pre- and post-treatment samples were then collected in summer 2018, post-planting season for primarily corn and soybeans, to assess seasonal differences and the efficacy of treatment. Samples prepared using solid phase extraction were analyzed using LC/MS/MS for six neonicotinoids: acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, and a sulfoximine (i.e., sulfoxaflor). Clothianidin was the most frequently detected (34%, max: 13.4 ng/L), followed by thiamethoxam (14.4%, max: 20.6 ng/L), imidacloprid (13%, max: 2.3 ng/L), and dinotefuran (0.1%, max: 1.4 ng/L). Alluvial aquifers (unadjusted odds ratio (UOR) = 14.1; 95% CI (5.4-36.9), p=<0.0001), wells with confining layers <15 m (UOR = 13.5, 95% CI (4.8-38.4), p=<0.0001), and less than 19.4 m in depth (UOR = 20.0; 95% CI (6.5-58.0), p=<0.0001) had the greatest risk for contamination. In vulnerable aquifers, neonicotinoids were detected in 62% of winter and 46% of summer samples, with winter samples over 3 times (UOR = 3.2; 95% CI (1.2-8.8), p = 0.02) more likely to have at least two neonicotinoids detected. In 55 public water supply systems, the median concentrations of clothianidin (p = 0.6), imidacloprid (p = 0.7), and thiamethoxam (p = 0.7) were unchanged following treatment.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of processing factors on free ZEN and hidden ZEN. After zein was treated under different temperature and pH, ZEN was quantified in samples before and after in vitro digestion. The ratios of hidden to total ZEN in zein are decreased from 54.25% to 40.74% after thermal treatment and from 54.25% to 0 after alkaline treatment, respectively. Conversely, acid treatment increased the ratio of hidden to total ZEN from 54.25% to 100%.

As scarce information is available, the current study is aimed at collecting new data on the co-occurrence and the fate of the most frequent masked, modified and emerging mycotoxins and other second fungal metabolites in maize food products and by-products. Three maize lots, obtained in different growing seasons, were processed using two different degermination processes, a dry-degermination system or a tempering-degermination one, in order to compare the interaction between mycotoxins and the dry-milling management system. Whole grain before and after cleaning, and all the products and the by-products were sampled twice for each lot and were subjected to a multi-mycotoxin LC-MS/MS analysis. More than 30 mycotoxins and other fungal metabolites, including masked or modified forms, co-occurred in all the maize milling fractions. Grain cleaning reduced all the detected fungal metabolites by 1.2-2 times, compared to the grain before cleaning. Animal feed flour showed the highest content of almost all the mycotoxins and fungal metabolites, with a consequent negative impact on animal health. Considering that for all the mycotoxins and fungal metabolites an inverse relationship with particle size was observed, flaking grits represented the healthiest maize products with the least contamination level, while the abatement was always lower for maize flour. Furthermore, the metabolites were variably redistributed in the maize fractions. The total aflatoxins, kojic acid, deoxynivalenol and its modified form, culmorin, and its associated forms, butenolide, fusaproliferin, fusaric acid, fusarinolic acid and, in some cases, zearalenone and its modified forms, and fusarin C were found to be concentrated significantly in the germ.

The mixed-mode mechanism including molecular affinity adsorption (between aptamers and targets), hydrophilic interaction and ionic interaction (between stationary phase and targets) were adopted and provided a better flexibility in adjusting separation selectivity to reduce nonspecific adsorption with respect to the single mode. Preparation and characterization of aptamer-based affinity monoliths were investigated, The characterization of pore size distribution, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and the specificity and cross-reaction were also evaluated. As a result, the hydrophilic nature and negative charge on affinity monolith were obtained.

NIR was applied in the present research to quantify the contamination level of total FBs, i.e., fumonisin B1+fumonisin B2 (FB1+FB2), and ZEN in Brazilian maize. From a total of six hundred and seventy-six samples, 236 were analyzed for FBs and 440 for ZEN. Three regression models were defined: one with 18 principal components (PCs) for FB1, one with 10 PCs for FB2, and one with 7 PCs for ZEN. Partial least square regression algorithm with full cross-validation was applied as internal validation. External validation was performed with 200 unknown samples (100 for FBs and 100 for ZEN). Correlation coefficient (R), determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), standard error of prediction (SEP) and residual prediction deviation (RPD) for FBs and ZEN were, respectively: 0.809 and 0.991; 0.899 and 0.984; 659 and 69.4; 682 and 69.8; and 3.33 and 2.71.

Phytosterols, squalene, tocopherols, tocotrienols, and carotenoids were quantified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detector (HPLC-DAD) and Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in different lots of post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage collected from a bioethanol plant over a time-span of one year. Fat-soluble bioactives were present at high levels in corn oil, with a prevalence of plant sterols over tocols and squalene. Beta-sitosterol and sitostanol accounted altogether for more than 60% of total sterols. The carotenoid profile was that typical of corn, with lutein and zeaxanthin as the prevalent molecules. The unsaponifiable lipid fraction profile of thin stillage was qualitatively similar to that of post-fermentation corn oil but, in quantitative terms, the amounts of valuable biomolecules were much lower because of the very high dilution of this side stream. Results indicate that post-fermentation corn oil is a promising and sustainable source of health-promoting bioactive molecules. The concomitant presence of a variegate complex of bioactive molecules with high antioxidant potentialities and their potential multifaceted market applications as functional ingredients for food, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical formulations, make the perspective of their recovery a promising strategy to create new bio-based value chains and maximize the sustainability of corn dry-grind bioethanol biorefineries.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Corn Bioethanol Side Streams: A Potential Sustainable Source of Fat-Soluble Bioactive Molecules for High-Value Applications.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33276511,2020

Thus, the stability of pesticide residues in stored samples is required information for pesticide registration. We monitored the degradation rates of fluroxypyr and halosulfuron-methyl in maize straw, mature maize grain, and fresh corn matrices to evaluate their storage stability. Analytes were extracted and cleaned up with a modified Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) method and then detected with liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. We optimized the workflow by testing different clean-up sorbents, LC columns, and chromatographic methods. The linearity correlation coefficients of fluroxypyr and halosulfuron-methyl in the three matrices were ≥0.994. At three fortification levels, the mean recoveries of fluroxypyr and halosulfuron-methyl were 84.2-114.8% and 83.8-105.5% with relative standard deviations of 2.4-9.4% and 2.7-10.2%, respectively. Degradation of the two herbicides in the three matrices was less than 30% over the 70-day storage period, indicating fluroxypyr and halosulfuron-methyl are stable in the tested maize matrices when stored at -20 °C for at least 70 days.

In this paper, chitosan nanofibers prepared by freeze-drying were modified with aptamers for dispersive solid phase extraction (dSPE) of trace zearalenone. The morphology of achieved chitosan nanofibers was found to be uniform and continuous, and the length was at the micron level with about a 400 nm diameter. The immobilization capacity of the aptamer was as high as 10.1 μg on 5 mg chitosan nanofibers with good stability and repeatability, owing to the high specific surface area of nanofibers. The aptamer modified chitosan nanofibers (Apt-CNFs) showed specific selectivity to zearalenone with a selectivity coefficient of 2.65 compared to the scrambled oligonucleotide functionalized CNFs, and the selectivity factors over other analogs and reference compounds were from 1.57 to 50.0.

The sugar composition of various Australian honeys (Manuka, Jarrah, Marri, Karri, Peppermint and White Gum) was first determined to illustrate the variance depending on the floral origin. Two of the honeys (Manuka and Jarrah) were then artificially adulterated with six different sugar syrups (rice, corn, golden, treacle, glucose and maple syrup). The findings demonstrate that HPTLC sugar profiles, in combination with organic extract profiles, can easily detect the sugar adulterants. As major sugars found in honey, the quantification of fructose and glucose, and their concentration ratio can be used to authenticate the honeys.

The plants were grown in a growth chamber under recommended conditions and dosed by these chemicals for 19 days. The plant samples (stem transpiration stream) and solution in the exposure media were taken to measure transpiration stream concentration factor (TSCF). The plant samples were analyzed by a freeze-thaw centrifugation technique followed by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection. Measured average TSCF values were used to test a neural network (NN) model previously developed for predicting plant uptake based on physicochemical properties. The results indicated that moderately hydrophobic compounds including carbamazepine and lincomycin have average TSCF values of 0.43 and 0.79, respectively. The average uptake of DEET, estriol, acetaminophen, and bisphenol A was also measured as 0.34, 0.29, 0.22, and 0.1, respectively. The 2,4-dinitrotoluene was not detected in the stem transpiration stream and it was shown to degrade in the root zone. Based on these results together with plant physiology measurements, we concluded that physicochemical properties of the chemicals did predict uptake, however, the role of other factors should be considered in the prediction of TSCF. While NN model could predict TSCF based on physicochemical properties with acceptable accuracies (mean squared error less than 0.25), the results for 2,4-dinitrotoluene and other compounds confirm the needs for considering other parameters related to both chemicals (stability) and plant species (role of lipids, lignin, and cellulose).",The Science of the total environment,"['D001692', 'D018551', 'D016571', 'D018517', 'D018526', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Biological Transport', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Transpiration', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Investigating plant uptake of organic contaminants through transpiration stream concentration factor and neural network models.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181989,2020

A field experiment was therefore conducted to analyze the PA contents in the tissues of maize (Zea mays L.) plants grown on slash-and-burn and slash-and-mulch plots, previously dominated with Chromolaena odorata, using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The results revealed, in general, trace amounts of PAs in the maize tissues (i.e. roots, leaves and grains) at maturity while significantly higher levels were detected in the surface soils sampled before sowing (for both plots), 45 days after sowing (slash-and-burn plot) and 90 days after sowing (slash-and-mulch plot). These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the leaching out of PAs from C. odorata residues (e.g. mulch and ash particles) and taken up by maize tissues.

Baking showed different volatile release patterns that are described by bell-shaped curves, plateaus and exponential growths. Flour-based breads had the higher overall volatile release during baking, but also high ratios in the final bread, while starch-based breads showed high pyrazine releases due to moisture losses. Meanwhile, toasting promoted the release of volatile compounds from the bread matrix, but also the additional generation of volatiles from Maillard reaction and caramelisation. Interestingly, gluten-free breads presented higher losses of volatiles during baking than wheat bread, which could partially explain their weaker aroma.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Real-Time Monitoring of Volatile Compounds Losses in the Oven during Baking and Toasting of Gluten-Free Bread Doughs: A PTR-MS Evidence.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33092071,2020

Recently, the presence of modified forms of fumonisins in fumonisin-contaminated food products has been reported. In order to evaluate the health risk of modified forms of fumonisins to the Japanese population, we analyzed modified forms of fumonisins in corn-based products retailed in Japan. The modified and free forms of fumonisins in food samples were hydrolyzed by alkaline treatment. The resulting hydrolyzed fumonisins were quantified by LC-MS/MS, and total fumonisins (sum of modified and free forms) was calculated. A total of 166 samples of corn-based products were analyzed over two years. The relative ratios of mean total fumonisins to mean free fumonisins in the cornflakes, corn snacks, corn flour and powdered corn soup samples were 4.7, 2.8, 2.1 and 1.2, respectively. Total fumonisins in the residual solid of five cornflake and three corn snack samples obtained after extraction with methanol-water (3 : 1) were quantified. In the cornflakes and corn snacks samples, 56-72 and 83-98% of the modified forms of fumonisins were present in the residual solid, respectively. The average daily intake of fumonisins from cornflakes and corn snacks by the Japanese population was estimated at 1.1 to 3.9 ng/kg body weight/day when the results of free fumonisins were used for the estimate, but when the results of total fumonisins were used, average daily intake increased about three times and was estimated at 3.3 to 12.5 ng/kg body weigh/day.

32930255,"Aflatoxins (AFs), as the secondary metabolites of the toxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, are well known to be extremely harmful to humans and animals because of their high toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity. Recurring and increasing studies on AF ingestion incidents indicate that AF contamination is a serious food safety issue worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, the IAC method may be limited to some laboratories because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) clean-up method based on humic acids (HAs), which is followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAs could be directly used as a DSPE sorbent after simple treatment without any chemical modification. In the HA-DSPE, AFs could remain on the HA sorbent by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was retained on HA via only hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix could be sufficiently washed off by n-hexane, whereas the AFs could still be retained on HA; thus, the selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices were achieved. Under the optimal conditions of HA-DSPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.3% to 106.2% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices i.e. blended oil, mixed olive oil, tea oil, sunflower seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, rice oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. Minor matrix effects ranging from 89.3% to 112.9% were obtained for the four AFs, which were acceptable. Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.063 and 0.102 μg kg-1 completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union (EU), China, or other countries. The proposed methodology was further validated using a naturally contaminated peanut oil, and the results indicated that the accuracy of the HA-DSPE could match the accuracy of the referenced IAC. In addition, HA-DSPE can be used to directly treat diluted edible oil without liquid-liquid extraction and HA is cheap and can be easily obtained from the market worldwide; these advantages make the proposed methodology simple, low-cost, and accessible for the determination of AFs in edible oils.",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,"['D000348', 'D001230', 'D001231', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004042', 'D005504', 'D006812', 'D010938', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Aflatoxins', 'Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Humic Substances', 'Plant Oils', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Facile dispersive solid-phase extraction based on humic acid for the determination of aflatoxins in various edible oils.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930255,2021

The milk samples were placed into plastic tubes and stored at 4°C for a period of 0, 1, 3, and 7 d. Individual anthocyanin composition and UFA were detected by HPLC-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. The results indicated that pelargonidin (0.258 vs. 0.054 µg/mL), cyanidin (5.550 vs. 1.808 µg/mL), petunidin (0.464 vs. 0.107 µg/mL), delphinidin (2.061 vs. 0.123 µg/mL), and total anthocyanin (8.332 vs. 2.091 µg/mL) significantly decreased in response to increasing storage day. Of interest, purple corn pigment had a significant effect on most of the UFA (C14:1n-5, C16:1n-7, C18:1n-9, C18:2n-6, C18:3n-3, C18:3n-6, C20:2n-6, C20:3n-3, and C20:4n-6), except for C17:1n-7 and C20:3n-6. Specifically, various stronger positive correlations were noted for anthocyanin composition and UFA (pelargonidin and petunidin with C14:1n-5, C17:1n-7, C18:2n-6, C20:2n-6, C20:3n-3, and C20:4n-6; and cyanidin and total anthocyanins with C14:1n-5, C16:1n-7, C17:1n-7). Collectively, the current study suggested that the addition of anthocyanins from purple corn pigment had the potential to maintain UFA concentrations in milk during the storage period.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D000872', 'D005227', 'D005231', 'D061353', 'D008892', 'D010860', 'D003313']","['Animals', 'Anthocyanins', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Food Storage', 'Milk', 'Pigments, Biological', 'Zea mays']",Short communication: Effect of purple corn pigment on change of anthocyanin composition and unsaturated fatty acids during milk storage.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32684465,2020

However, the 3DXA are poorly extractable from grain tissue. This work aimed to determine the relative stability and extractability of sorghum 3-DXA vs anthocyanins from maize and cowpea under microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). UV-Vis and UPLC-MS/MS spectrometry were used to characterize the properties. The 3-DXA remained structurally stable to MAE conditions up to 1200 W/100 °C/30 min. MAE increased sorghum 3-DXA yield 100% versus control (3100 vs 1520 mg/g). On the other hand, both maize and cowpea anthocyanins were unstable and rapidly degraded under MAE. Cell wall-derived ferulate esters were detected in sorghum and maize MAE extracts, indicating cell wall degradation occurred during MAE. Thus the enhanced extraction of 3-DXA under MAE was due to their structural stability, along with improved diffusion from cell matrix due to microwave-induced sorghum cell wall disruption.",Food chemistry,"['D000872', 'D002851', 'D002853', 'D002523', 'D008872', 'D010936', 'D012639', 'D045868', 'D053719', 'D000070658', 'D003313']","['Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Microwaves', 'Plant Extracts', 'Seeds', 'Sorghum', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vigna', 'Zea mays']",Stability of 3-deoxyanthocyanin pigment structure relative to anthocyanins from grains under microwave assisted extraction.,"['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663754,2020

32612135,"Improvement of the food value of rice straw is urgently required in rice crop growing areas to mitigate pollution caused by rice straw burning and enhance the supply of high-quality forages for ruminants. The aims of the present study were to compare the effects of fresh corn Stover and rice straw co-fermented with probiotics and enzymes on rumen fermentation and establish the feasibility of increasing the rice straw content in ruminant diets and, by extension, reducing air pollution caused by burning rice straw. Twenty Simmental hybrid beef cattle were randomly allotted to two groups with ten cattle per group.

However, due its relatively low mechanical properties and water solubility, many inorganic compounds (e.g., bioactive glasses [BGs]) have been used in combination with zein to obtain composite materials with improved mechanical properties. Such inorganic additions provide further biological functionality to zein. In this work, fiber mats of zein with incorporation of BG and copper doped BG particles are successfully obtained by electrospinning. At first the electrospinnability of the blends is assessed, then the morphological and chemical characterization of the mats is done. Degradation study in cell culture medium (Dubelcco's modified Eagle's medium) reveals a sufficient strength of the fibers, which in turn is necessary for in vitro cellular studies. Cell culture studies using MG-63 and C2C12 cells show promising results, demonstrating increased cell proliferation and growth for fiber mats containing both types of BGs.

32392267,"Sweet corn juice is becoming increasingly popular in China. In order to provide valuable health-related information to consumers, the nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of raw and boiled purple sweet corn juices were herein investigated. Sugars, antinutrients, total free phenols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity were analyzed by conventional chemical methods. The viscosity and stability of juices were determined by Ubbelohde viscosity meter and centrifugation, respectively. Boiling process could elevate viscosity, stability and sugar content, and reduce antinutrients, total free phenols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity in corn juice. In addition, short time boiling efficiently reduced the degradation of anthocyanins during subsequent refrigeration. The content of amino acids, vitamin B1/B2 and E were detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry was used for the analysis of fatty acids and aroma compounds. Several aroma compounds not previously reported in corn were identified, including 1-heptanol, 2-methyl-2-butenal, (Z)-3-nonen-1-ol, 3-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3-hexadiene, and 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol. Interestingly, the boiling process had no apparent effect on the amino acids profile, but it caused a 45.8% loss of fatty acids in the juice by promoting the retention of fatty acids in the corn residue. These results provide detailed information that could be used for increasing consumers' knowledge of sweet corn juice, further development of sweet corn juice by food producers, and maize breeding programs.",PloS one,"['D000447', 'D000596', 'D000872', 'D000975', 'D002851', 'D008401', 'D019850', 'D010636', 'D010936', 'D012256', 'D013831', 'D003313']","['Aldehydes', 'Amino Acids', 'Anthocyanins', 'Antioxidants', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Heptanol', 'Phenols', 'Plant Extracts', 'Riboflavin', 'Thiamine', 'Zea mays']",Nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of purple sweet corn juice before and after boiling.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392267,2020

Food products made from natural ingredients such as corn and common bean might serve as alternatives for the treatment of UC. This study aimed to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of the consumption of a baked corn and bean snack (CBS) in an in vivo model of UC using 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) as inductor of colitis. CD-1 mice (45, n = 9/group) were randomly separated into 5 groups, treated for 6-weeks as follows: G1 (basal diet, BD), G2 (2% DSS), G3 (20 g CBS/body weight BW/day + BD), G4 (40 g CBS/BW/day + BD) and G5 (60 g CBS/BW/day + BD). BW, Disease Activity Index (DAI), and feces were collected throughout the treatment. After euthanasia, organs (spleen, liver, and colon) were excised and weighed. Feces were analyzed for β-glucuronidase (β-GLUC) activity and gas-chromatography. The colons were analyzed for histopathology, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and gene analysis. At the end of treatments, among the DSS-induced groups, G3 exhibited the lowest BW losses (11.5%), MPO activity (10.4%) and β-GLUC (8.6%). G4 presented the lowest DAI (0.88), relative spleen weight, and histological inflammation score (p < 0.05). Compared to G2, CBS consumption significantly (p < 0.05) reduced serum TNF-α, IL-10, and MCP-1 levels. The fecal metabolome analysis ranked 9-decenoic acid, decane, and butyric acid as the main contributors of pathways associated with the β-oxidation of fatty acids. G4 showed the highest fecal/cecal contents of short-chain fatty acids among all the DSS-induced groups. For the gene expression, G4 was clustered with G1, showing a differential inhibition of the pro-inflammatory genes Il1r1, Il1a, Tlr4, Tlr2, and Tnfrsf1b. In conclusion, CBS consumption decreased the inflammatory state and reduced the expression of the IL-1 receptor, TLR, and TNF-α-associated pathways in DSS-induced UC in CD-1 mice.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000818', 'D018932', 'D002908', 'D003092', 'D003093', 'D003106', 'D004195', 'D015536', 'D005227', 'D005243', 'D015870', 'D007249', 'D008297', 'D051379', 'D027805', 'D017472', 'D012639', 'D062410', 'D013154', 'D014409', 'D003313']","['Animals', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colitis', 'Colitis, Ulcerative', 'Colon', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fatty Acids', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Inflammation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phaseolus', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1', 'Seeds', 'Snacks', 'Spleen', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Zea mays']","Consumption of a baked corn and bean snack reduced chronic colitis inflammation in CD-1 mice via downregulation of IL-1 receptor, TLR, and TNF-α associated pathways.","[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000178', 'Q000178', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000178', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'diet therapy', 'diet therapy', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'diet therapy', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32331643,2021

32240053,"Salicylates are among the most known anti-inflammatory drugs, used both in human and veterinary medicine. They also occur naturally in plants. Residues of salicylic acid in tissues and eggs may occur after drug administration or exposure of animals to feed material with high salicylate content. An animal study was performed on laying hens. The birds received sodium salicylate or acetylsalicylic acid (10 mg/kg b.w.) for 7 days or were given corn containing 1.18 mg/kg of salicylic acid. Samples of liver, muscle and plasma were collected at 0, 4, 8, 24 and 72 h after treatment; eggs were collected daily for 14 days. Salicylic acid and its metabolites: gentisic acid, salicyluric acid and gentisuric acid were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. In both liver and muscle, the residues after administration of sodium salicylate were initially higher than for acetylsalicylic acid but they depleted at the same time. The deposition and depletion profile of salicylic acid in eggs was similar for groups receiving both drugs; the plateau level reached 248 ± 61.5 μg/kg and 275 ± 82.1 μg/kg. The concentration of salicylic acid in tissues and eggs of animals receiving salicylic acid was low. Gentisic acid was found in individual samples of liver, muscle and eggs from all treated groups. The exposure of hens to the salicylates at feed additive levels and to naturally occurring salicylates results in low residue concentrations and fast depletion of salicylic acid.

Batch experiments were conducted under different experimental conditions: CSL volumes, reaction times, desorption times, and microsphere recyclability. Results showed that 5 g of microspheres reacted with 5 mL of DON-polluted CSL for 5 min, the microspheres can be recycled 155 times, and the maximum DON adsorption for the microspheres was 2.34 μg/mL. During recycling, microspheres were regenerated by deionized water every time; after the microspheres were cleaned, DON in the deionized water was degraded by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 70 °C for 1 h at pH 12. The mechanism for physical adsorption and hydrogen bonding was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR).

However, literature demonstrates that contamination of these mycotoxins is highly skewed and bulk samples do not always represent accurately the overall contamination in a batch of corn. Single kernel analysis can provide an insightful level of analysis of the contamination of aflatoxin and fumonisin, as well as suggest a possible remediation to the skewness present in bulk detection. Current literature describes analytical methods capable of detecting aflatoxin and fumonisin at a single kernel level, such as liquid chromatography, fluorescence imaging, and reflectance imaging. These methods could provide tools to classify mycotoxin contaminated kernels and study potential co-occurrence of aflatoxin and fumonisin.

In this study, sterilized corn was inoculated with F. poae and incubated to allow fungal growth before being examined via liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to determine the concentrations of T-2/HT-2. Broilers were then fed with a mix of moldy corn and normal feed at different ratios to obtain different toxin doses. After 35 days, the contaminated feed was replaced with mycotoxin-free feed and the distribution and concentration of residual toxins in the tissues and organs of the chickens were examined at different time points. The results showed that at the time of feed replacement (0 h), T-2 residue was present at significantly higher concentrations in the lungs and small intestines than in other tissues (P < 0.05). In addition, T-2 concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner in the tissues of chickens in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups; however, the differences in concentration between the groups were not statistically significant. The HT-2 content (0 h) in the livers and small intestines was significantly higher than that in other tissues (P < 0.05). At 48 h post-feed replacement, the concentration of T-2 dropped below detectable levels in all tissues while HT-2 could still be detected at 192 h post-feed replacement.

Further, we explored various parameters of enzymatic detoxification in neutralized oil and analyzed tocopherols and sterols losses in the corn oil. In addition, the distribution of degraded products was demonstrated as well by Agilent 6510 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry.

To assess to what extent beef and dairy farms represent a source of hormones to the aquatic environment, surface water runoff samples from three beef and dairy farms that utilize best manure management practices were evaluated for hormone concentrations (estrogens, androgens, progestogens) and estrogenic activity. Runoff was collected from weirs at the edge of each of six study fields from March 2008 to March 2010 and was analyzed for hormone concentrations using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and for estrogenic activity using the E-screen bioassay. The majority of runoff events occurred in February and March when the soil was frozen. Progesterone and 4-androstenedione were the most frequently detected hormones (63% and 50%, respectively) and occurred at event loads up to 49,000 μg/ha and 26,000 μg/ha, respectively. Progesterone, 4-androstenedione, 17α-estradiol had the highest event load concentrations and were found at the field that sustained dairy cattle grazing during the winter and were likely due to application of excreta on frozen soil. The high progesterone event loads could lead to concentrations in receiving streams that exceed the lowest observable effects concentrations for fish. There was a consistent association with the elevated zearalenone presence and corn production. The synthetic hormones, 17α-trenbolone and 17β-trenbolone, were not detected in runoff from the beef farm that utilized trenbolone acetate implants, which is likely due to their short half lives. Estrogenic activity in runoff samples ranged from 0.09 to 133 ng/L estradiol equivalents, with 39% of runoff events exceeding the 2 ng/L predicted-no-effect-concentration for fish.

The survival of M. separata was extremely low and only around 2% insects can reach the adult stage on Ritter's diet. But, it can reach up to 100% if corn leaf powder (CLP) was mixed, and insects grew faster and gained more mass. After testing a set of mixtures of Ritter's diet and CLP, we found that 14.3% was the optimal proportion of CLP for making the artificial diet. We then used chloroform to extract CLP. Insect performance was still much better on Ch-extracted CLP diets than that on Ritter's diet, but it was poorer than that on the diets containing unprocessed CLP, suggesting that the essential factor(s) was only partially extracted from corn leaf. We then used methanol and dichloromethane, two solvents differing in their polarity, to process the extractions and analyzed the extracted chemicals using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Insects had a better performance on dichloromethane-extracted CLP diet in comparison to methanol-extracted one, indicating that the important factor(s) is more prone to methanol extraction. The reported recipe here is useful for the research on M. separata and possibly other grain-crop eating armyworms. The functions of the chemicals extracted from corn leaf tissue can be investigated in the future studies.",Journal of insect science (Online),"['D000818', 'D005526', 'D009036', 'D011679', 'D003313']","['Animals', 'Food, Formulated', 'Moths', 'Pupa', 'Zea mays']",A Semi-Synthetic Diet and the Potential Important Chemicals for Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).,"[None, None, 'Q000254', 'Q000254', None]","[None, None, 'growth & development', 'growth & development', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31725878,2020
31713694,"An enzyme-free fluorometric assay is described for the determination of zearalenone (ZEN). The method combines (a) catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA), (b) ultrahigh fluorescent light-up G-rich DNA sequences in proximity to silver nanoclusters (Ag NCs), and (c) the use of aptamers (Apt). In the presence of ZEN, the inhibit sequence (Inh) is released from the aptamer-trigger sequence (Apt-T) via the binding of ZEN and the aptamer of Apt-T. The free Apt-T acts as a switch that opens the hairpins H1 and H2 to generate H1-H2 complex. The released Apt-T is available to trigger the next round of CHA between H1 and H2. Finally, the hybridization between H1 and the Ag NCs probe (P) causes the G-rich sequence to be in close proximity to the dark Ag NCs encapsulated by P. This leads to highly efficient lighting up of the Ag NCs and the production of amplified fluorescence with excitation/emission peaks at 575/628 nm.

The cross-reactivity for all four mycotoxins were demonstrated to be low. Moreover, the test data were compared with HPLC-MS/MS confirmatory analysis results and good agreement was found between them. In conclusion, the SPR method for simultaneously detecting four mycotoxins has been developed with high sensitivity, good linearity and specificity, which can meet the detection requirements of cereal foods.",Food chemistry,"['D016604', 'D002851', 'D003429', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D006835', 'D057230', 'D009183', 'D009793', 'D012680', 'D020349', 'D053719', 'D014255', 'D014908', 'D003313', 'D015025']","['Aflatoxin B1', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cross Reactions', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Hydrazones', 'Limit of Detection', 'Mycotoxins', 'Ochratoxins', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Trichothecenes', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays', 'Zearalenone']","Simultaneous detection of aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol in corn and wheat using surface plasmon resonance.","['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000295', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'instrumentation', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351258,2019
31339301,"The frequent use of precautionary food allergen labeling (PAL) such as ""may contain"" frustrates allergic individuals who rely on such labeling to determine whether a food is safe to consume. One technique to study whether foods contain allergens is targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) employing scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). However, the applicability of a single MRM method to many commercial foods is unknown as complex and heterogeneous interferences derived from the unique composition of each food matrix can hinder quantification of trace amounts of allergen contamination. We developed a freely available, open source software package MAtrix-Dependent Interference Correction (MADIC) to identify interference and applied it with a method targeting 14 allergens. Among 84 unique food products, we found patterns of allergen contamination such as wheat in grains, milk in chocolate-containing products, and soy in breads and corn flours. We also found additional instances of contamination in products with and without PAL as well as highly variable soy content in foods containing only soybean oil and/or soy lecithin. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying LC-MS/MS to a variety of food products with sensitive detection of multiple allergens in spite of variable matrix interference.",Analytical chemistry,"['D000485', 'D002853', 'D005504', 'D057230', 'D053719']","['Allergens', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Limit of Detection', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Addressing Complex Matrix Interference Improves Multiplex Food Allergen Detection by Targeted LC-MS/MS.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000379', None, None]","['analysis', None, 'methods', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339301,2020
31293441,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the leading cause of chronic liver injury and the third most common reason for liver transplantations in Western countries. It is unclear so far how different fat sources in Western diets (WD) influence the development of NASH. Our study investigates the impact of non-trans fat (NTF) and corn oil (Corn) as fat source in a WD mouse model of steatohepatitis on disease development and progression. C57BL/6J wildtype (WT) mice were fed ""standard"" WD (WD-Std), WD-NTF or WD-Corn for 24 weeks. WT animals treated with WD-NTF exhibit distinct features of the metabolic syndrome compared to WD-Std and WD-Corn. This becomes evident by a worsened insulin resistance and elevated serum ALT, cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels compared to WD-Corn. Animals fed WD-Corn on the contrary tend to a weakened disease progression in the described parameters. After 24 weeks feeding with WD-NTF and WD-Std, WD-Corn lead to a comparable steatohepatitis initiation by histomorphological changes and immune cell infiltration compared to WD-Std. Immune cell infiltration results in a significant increase in mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, which is more pronounced in WD-NTF compared to WD-Std and WD-Corn. Interestingly the fat source has no impact on the composition of accumulating fat within liver tissue as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging of multiple lipid classes. The described effects of different fat sources on the development of steatohepatitis finally resulted in variations in fibrosis development. Animals treated with WD-NTF displayed massive collagen accumulation, whereas WD-Corn even seems to protect from extracellular matrix deposition. Noteworthy, WD-Corn provokes massive histomorphological modifications in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and severe accumulation of extracellular matrix which are not apparent in WD-Std and WD-NTF treatment. Different fat sources in WD-Std contribute to strong steatohepatitis development in WT mice after 24 weeks treatment. Surprisingly, corn oil provokes histomorphological changes in eWAT tissue. Accordingly, both WD-NTF and WD-Corn appear suitable as alternative dietary treatment to replace ""standard"" WD-Std as a diet mouse model of steatohepatitis whereas WD-Corn leads to strong changes in eWAT morphology.",Frontiers in physiology,[],[],The Influence of Different Fat Sources on Steatohepatitis and Fibrosis Development in the Western Diet Mouse Model of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH).,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293441,2020

Sixteen argan oil samples (100% pure-certified and other commercial argan oils), possible adulterating vegetable oils (i.e., olive, sunflower, corn, and soya oils), and virgin argan oil blended with olive, sunflower, corn, and soya oils at levels of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% were analyzed. Spectrophotometric CUPRAC, DPPH, and ABTS assays were applied. Discrimination of fraudulent argan oils from virgin samples was performed by utilizing orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) regression modeling with good sensitivity and specificity. We suggested [γ-toc/α-toc] value as a new first screening adulteration factor (AF) that could be used to assess fraudulent argan oil samples. The distinct decrement in AF value was observed by the increase of adulteration rate. The AF values for virgin argan oils were ranged from 11.8 (lower limit) to 18.6 (upper limit). The presence of β-sitosterol detected in commercial argan oils (with AF values out of limit values) was evaluated as fraudulent which was in accordance with the proposed assay.

It has been understood since the early 1980s that in most parts of Canada, the predominant chemotype of F. graminearum is 15ADON, and not the 3ADON chemotype mainly found in Europe and Asia. The discovery of F. graminearum strains that did not produce DON but the structurally related 7-α hydroxy, 15-deacetylcalonectrin (3ANX) and its hydrolysis product 7-α hydroxy, 3,15-dideacetylcalonectrin to (NX) demonstrated that we still have a lot to learn about this well studied but complicated fungus. We conducted a survey of maize and wheat samples from Ontario farms. In the 2015 crop year, we isolated 86 strains and tested a representative subset of 20 using the published genetic probes for assessing genotype. We also developed a targeted LC-MS/MS method for the identification and quantitation of known toxins from this species to determine chemotype. The results showed that 80% of our strains produced some 3ANX in addition to 15ADON and one strain produced 3ANX and no 15ADON. Comparison of chemical data with genotyping revealed that in more than 50% of the cases there was no clear agreement. These data demonstrate the importance of chemical analysis for understanding the toxigenic potential of strains, especially using a LC-MS method that is capable of differentiating 3ADON and 15ADON. For this collection, genotyping of isolates did not produce reliable information on the chemotype. This is the first report of 3ANX toxin production concurrently with 15ADON and suggests that the 3ANX producers in North America likely originated from the 15ADON background.",PloS one,"['D053898', 'D002853', 'D002523', 'D005670', 'D005838', 'D009183', 'D009864', 'D010935', 'D053719', 'D014255', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Biosynthetic Pathways', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Fusarium', 'Genotype', 'Mycotoxins', 'Ontario', 'Plant Diseases', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Trichothecenes', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']","Comparing genotype and chemotype of Fusarium graminearum from cereals in Ontario, Canada.","[None, None, 'Q000382', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000382', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000382', 'Q000382']","[None, None, 'microbiology', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, 'microbiology', None, 'analysis', 'microbiology', 'microbiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071188,2020

31004850,"A 2D LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of 350 pesticides, 16 mycotoxins as well as the growth regulators Chlormequat and Mepiquat was developed. The method is applicable to cereals and products thereof. Attention should be paid to the simultaneous analysis of the cereal-relevant mycotoxins aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2, ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone. Moreover, the tropane alkaloids atropine/scopolamine could be integrated into the final method. The samples were extracted with a mixture of acetonitrile/water (80:20), diluted with acetonitrile and injected into an LC-LC-MS/MS system. There were no further manual clean-up steps. The automatic online clean-up took place during the HILIC-separation in the first dimension (YMC-Pack Diol; 2.1 × 100 mm; 5 μm, 120 Å). Here, polar matrix compounds were retained, while the majority of the analyte scope eluted in a fraction at the beginning of the analytical run. This fraction was transferred to the second dimension by a packed loop interface (Agilent Zorbax SB-C8; 4.6 × 12.5 mm; 5 μm; 80 Å). On the second column (Phenomenex Synergi Fusion RP C18; 2 × 100 mm; 2.5 μm; 100 Å), the majority of the scope was separated by a typical RP-gradient. Only some of the polar pesticides could not be transferred to the second column. They eluted directly after the transfer step from the HILIC-column to the MS/MS. The final method was sensitive enough to meet all the regulated maximum levels for pesticides in cereals according to EU Regulation 396/2005 and those for contaminants according to EU Regulation 1881/2006. Above all, the method was so robust and accurate that nearly 90% of the pesticides and all the tested mycotoxins, growth regulators and tropane alkaloids fulfilled the validation criteria of the SANTE guideline document, although the demanding criteria are only applicable to pesticides. For the verification, eight proficiency tests were passed successfully: three for the pesticide analysis, three for the mycotoxin analysis, and two for the analysis of the tropane alkaloids. In addition to the already mentioned contaminants, the six most important ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine/ergotaminine) and two modified mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside and zearalenone-sulfate, also known as masked mycotoxins) were detected during the routine analysis of rye and corn samples.","Journal of chromatography.

30994936,"Pigmented maize has been extensively studied due to its high anthocyanin content. This study has been focused mainly on kernel, although the whole plant of purple corn is a potential source of anthocyanins. First, general parameters of extraction (solvent system, solvent-to-solid ratio, number of extractions, and acid type) were established depending on the total anthocyanins content. Then, three extraction methods to access anthocyanins were compared: maceration extraction (ME), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). Since the residual material still possessed an intense color, a further treatment was performed by application of enzymatic-assisted extraction (EAE). Three enzymatic cocktails (Xylanases, Celluclast, and Depol), pH, and temperature were evaluated to establish optimal reaction conditions. Subsequent analysis and identification of the anthocyanins obtained by four different extraction techniques were performed using HPLC and HPLC-mass spectrometry, respectively. The most efficient method was UAE using 20 min of ultrasound (100 W) preceded by sample treatment in the following conditions: ethanol/water/lactic acid mixture (80:19:1), two extractions, 1:10 solvent-to-solid ratio. As a result, anthocyanins from corn cob and corn husk were extracted at concentrations of 24.32 and 25.80 mg/gDW, respectively. No difference in the anthocyanins profile for samples extracted by three different methods was observed. However, an enhanced presence of cyanidin-3-(6''malonyl)glucoside was detected in the sample corresponding to the EAE method. Therefore, the Cahuacintle corn husk can be considered as a competitive source of anthocyanins with the available commercial sources. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The by-products obtained from Cacahuacintle purple corn can be potentially used as natural colorants thanks to their anthocyanins content. In this work, we established the most efficient extraction method of anthocyanins from corn husk and corn cob, and demonstrated that their anthocyanins profile is comparable to other Peruvian purple corns, which are currently used as natural colorants. Therefore, the extraction procedure described in this study might be scaled-up in an industrial process to get access to anthocyanins from undervalued wastes.",Journal of food science,"['D000872', 'D002851', 'D003116', 'D005524', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D010568', 'D010936', 'D018514', 'D012997', 'D013045', 'D003313']","['Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Color', 'Food Technology', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Peru', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Structures', 'Solvents', 'Species Specificity', 'Zea mays']",Extraction and Identification of Anthocyanins in Corn Cob and Corn Husk from Cacahuacintle Maize.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'methods', None, 'methods', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30994936,2019
30987373,"Nowadays, adulteration of honey is a frequent fraud that is sometimes motivated by the high price of this product in comparison with other sweeteners. Food adulteration is considered a deception to consumers that may have an important impact on people's health. For this reason, it is important to develop fast, cheap, reliable and easy to use analytical methods for food control. In the present research, a novel method based on headspace-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-IMS) for the detection of adulterated honey by adding high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has been developed. A Box-Behnken design combined with a response surface method have been used to optimize a procedure to detect adulterated honey. Intermediate precision and repeatability studies have been carried out and coefficients of variance of 4.90% and 4.27%, respectively, have been obtained. The developed method was then tested to detect adulterated honey. For that purpose, pure honey samples were adulterated with HFCS at different percentages (10-50%). Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) showed a tendency of the honey samples to be classified according to the level of adulteration. Nevertheless, a perfect classification was not achieved. On the contrary, a full classification (100%) of all the honey samples was performed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This is the first time the technique of HS-IMS has been applied for the determination of adulterated honey with HFCS in an automatic way.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],A Screening Method Based on Headspace-Ion Mobility Spectrometry to Identify Adulterated Honey.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987373,2020

30903174,"Use of botanicals and natural substances in consumer products has increased in recent years. Such extracts can contain protein that may theoretically represent a potential risk of IgE-mediated allergy. No method has yet been generally accepted or validated for assessment of the allergenic potential of proteins. For development of suitable methods datasets of allergenic and nonallergenic (or low allergenic) proteins are required that can serve, respectively, as positive and negative controls. However, data are unavailable on proteins that lack or have low allergenic potential. Here, low allergenic potential proteins are identified based on the assumption that proteins with established human exposure, but with a lack of an association with allergy, possess low allergenic potential. Proteins were extracted from sources considered to have less allergenic potential (corn, potato, spinach, rice, and tomato) as well as higher allergenic potential (wheat) regarding common allergenic foods. Proteins were identified and semi-quantified by label-free proteomic analysis conducted using mass spectrometry. Predicted allergenicity was determined using AllerCatPro (https://allercatpro.bii.a-star.edu.sg/). In summary, 9077 proteins were identified and semi-quantified from 6 protein sources. Within the top 10% of the most abundant proteins identified, 178 characterized proteins were found to have no evidence for allergenicity predicted by AllerCatPro and were considered to have low allergenic potential.

Herein, a novel, simple and label-free fluorescent aptasensor, based on quaternized tetraphenylethene salt (TPE-Z), graphene oxide (GO) and AFB1 aptamer, has been constructed to detect AFB1. In the presence of AFB1, AFB1 aptamer undergoes a conformational switch from single stranded structure to the AFB1/AFB1 aptamer complex upon target binding, which induces the release of TPE-Z/AFB1 aptamer from the surface of GO. Thus, the fluorescence of TPE-Z/AFB1 aptamer is recovered. The assay can be performed by simply mixing TPE-Z, AFB1 aptamer, the GO and the AFB1 samples with a detection limit of 0.25 ng/mL.

30828760,"In this paper, a fluorescent method was developed for ochratoxin A (OTA) detection that uses iron-doped porous carbon (MPC) and aptamer-functionalized nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs-Apt) as probes. In this method, the adsorbance of the NGQDs-Apt on the MPC due to a π-π interaction between the aptamer and the MPC results in the quenching of the fluorescence of the NGQDs-Apt. However, since OTA interacts strongly with the aptamer, the presence of OTA leads to the detachment of the NGQDs-Apt from the MPC, resulting in the resumption of fluorescence from the NGQDs-Apt. When exonuclease I (Exo I) is also added to the solution, this exonuclease specifically digests the aptamer, leading to the release of the OTA back into the solution. This free OTA then interacts with another MPC-NGQDs-Apt system, inducing the release of more NGQDs into the solution, which enhances the fluorescent intensity compared to that of the system with no Exo I. Utilizing this behavior of OTA in the presence of NGQDs-Apt, it was possible to detect concentrations of OTA ranging from 10 to 5000 nM, with a limit of detection of 2.28 nM. Our method was tested by applying it to the detection of OTA in wheat and corn samples. This method has four advantages: (1) the magnetic porous carbon is easy to prepare, its porosity enhances its loading capacity for NGQDs, it highly efficiently quenches the fluorescence of the NGQDs, and its magnetic properties facilitate the separation of the MPC from other species in solution; (2) applying double magnetic separation decreases the background signal; (3) Exo I digests the free aptamer effectively, which allows the resulting free OTA to induce the release of more NGQDs-Apt, ultimately enhancing the fluorescent signal; and (4) the proposed method presented high sensitivity and a wide linear detection range. This method may prove helpful in food safety analysis and new biosensor development (achieved by using different aptamer sequences to that used in the present work).

30798914,"Modern diets have become increasingly rich in fructose, for example through the addition of high-fructose corn syrup to many foods and drinks. It has been suggested that this might lead to hepatotoxicity, including the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. After entering hepatocytes via insulin-independent glucose transporter 2 transmembrane carrier proteins, fructose is phosphorylated to fructose-1-phosphate in a reaction catalysed by fructokinase (ketohexokinase). In turn, fructose-1-phosphate is hydrolysed by aldolase B to glyceraldehydes. Glyceraldehydes may enter gluconeogenesis via fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and fructose-6-phosphate; glyceraldehydes may also enter glycogenolysis via pyruvate. The last pathway involves conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Alternatively, pyruvate may be converted, via the action of the hepatic lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme LDH-5, into lactate. In liver damage, the LDH-5 isoenzyme becomes elevated, predominantly in serum/plasma. We therefore hypothesised that if dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity, there should be a positive correlation between erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate and plasma LDH-5. This hypothesis was tested by assaying venous blood samples taken from 39 patients at rest, three hours after eating. Quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectrometry following gel electrophoresis was used to assay erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate levels. Similarly, plasma LDH-5 concentrations were spectrophotometrically analysed, using the pyruvate-lactate reaction, following electrophoretic separation of the LDH isoenzymes. A significant positive correlation was found between the two variables (r = 0.44, p = 0.0047). This result, which supports our hypothesis, is evidence in favour of the possibility that dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity. In addition to being a marker of hepatic damage, LDH-5 may play a more direct epigenetic role in causing liver damage; acute hepatic injury is associated with nuclear translocation of LDH, causing the production of lactate from pyruvate in the nucleus; in turn, the lactate inhibits histone deacetylase and is associated with upregulation of genes associated with the damage response, leading to cell death.",Medical hypotheses,"['D000328', 'D000818', 'D044127', 'D004912', 'D005260', 'D005631', 'D005632', 'D005943', 'D066248', 'D006801', 'D007527', 'D007770', 'D000080864', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D051379', 'D010766', 'D010865', 'D017550']","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Erythrocytes', 'Female', 'Fructokinases', 'Fructose', 'Gluconeogenesis', 'High Fructose Corn Syrup', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase', 'Lactate Dehydrogenase 5', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared']",Fructose-associated hepatotoxicity indexed by the lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme LDH-5.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000009', None, 'Q000009', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'enzymology', None, 'metabolism', 'adverse effects', None, 'adverse effects', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798914,2019

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to create a robust aptamer-modified magnetic MIL-101 with covalent bonding for the magnetic separation and enrichment of ochratoxin A. The saturated adsorption of ochratoxin A by aptamer-modified magnetic MIL-101 was 7.9 times greater than that by magnetic metal-organic framework MIL-101 due to the former's high selective recognition as well as good stability. It could be used for extraction more than 12 times with no significant changes in the extraction efficiency. An aptamer-modified magnetic MIL-101-based method of magnetic solid-phase extraction combined with ultra high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry was developed for the determination of trace ochratoxin A with limit of detection of 0.067 ng/L. Ochratoxin A of 4.53-13.7 ng/kg was determined in corn and peanut samples. The recoveries were in the range 82.8-108% with a relative standard deviation (n = 5) of 4.5-6.5%.

30466136,"Zearalenone (ZEA) is a toxic metabolite of Fusarium genera that frequently contaminates cereal grains. India being a tropical country provides suitable conditions for fungal invasion to the cereals. In the absence of any regulatory limits for ZEA in India, the present study was carried out to analyze the contamination levels of ZEA in different cereal samples consumed by Indian population and its exposure assessment through intake. Out of 117 cereal samples comprising of wheat, rice, corn, and oats, 70 (84%) were found to be positive for ZEA contamination, among which 24 (33%) samples exceeded the permissible limits proposed by European Union when analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The positive samples were further validated by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS) analysis. Based on the quantitative estimation of ZEA contamination in cereals and their daily consumption values, the probable daily intake of ZEA was found to be 16.9- and 7.9-fold higher in rice and wheat samples, respectively, than the tolerable daily intake prescribed by European Food Safety Authority. The presence of ZEA at high levels indicates a higher exposure risk for Indian population as wheat and rice are staple foods in India. Thus, there is an immediate need to set the permissible levels of ZEA in India to safeguard the health of 1.34 billion people. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: High levels of ZEA contaminated wheat and rice samples suggest that the consumers are at a greater exposure risk. The study will help the Indian regulatory bodies to set the permissible level of ZEA in different cereal grains so as to safeguard the health of common masses.

30195545,"Beverage quality in the brewing industry is heavily influenced by ingredient properties. The contribution of raw ingredients such as yeast and hops to beer flavor is well understood. However, the influence of barley genotype and/or environment on flavor (the malt 'source') is largely unexplored. Here, a study was performed to determine (i) if there are metabolite differences among six commercial malt sources, (ii) if differences in malt chemistry are reflected in the chemistry of the beer, and (iii) if the differences in the beer chemistry impact sensory attributes of beer, through flavor and flavor stability. Six distinct sources of malts (six varieties from three maltsters) were brewed into six beers using a recipe designed to evaluate differences in flavor. Metabolomics and ionomics was used to characterize chemical variation among the six malts and beers using UHPLC- and HILIC-MS (non-volatile metabolites), HS-SPME/GC-MS (beer volatiles), and ICP-MS (malt metals). These analyses detected a total of 5042 compounds in malt, of which 217 were annotated and included amines, amino acids, fatty acids/lipids/fatty acyls, saccharides/glucosides/sugar acids/sugar alcohols, carboxylic acid derivatives, organic acids, phenolics/benzenoids, purines, pyrimidines/pyridines, terpenes, and organosulfurs. A total of 4568 compounds were detected in beer, of which 246 were annotated and included esters, aldehydes, and alcohols. Statistical analysis revealed chemical variation among the six malts (50/217 malt metabolites varied) and beers (150/246). The six beers were evaluated for flavor using a modified descriptive analysis for 45 sensory traits at 0, 4, and 8 weeks of storage at 4 °C. Principal component analysis of the sensory data revealed flavor differences among the six beers at 8 weeks, and the malt-type Full Pint was described as fruity and Meredith as corn chip. The metabolite and sensory data were integrated and revealed associations between flavor profiles in beer and the annotated malt and beer. The fruity or corn chip flavor profiles in beer were associated beer purines/pyrimidines, volatile ketones, amines, and phenolics, and malt lipids, saccharides, phenols, amines, and alkaloids. Taken together, these data support a role of malt source in beer flavor and flavor stability. As a raw ingredient, malting barley genotypes can be evaluated for a contribution to flavor, and this may be a future target for plant breeding, agronomy, and malting efforts to selectively improve flavor, flavor stability, and quality in beer.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000596', 'D001515', 'D003080', 'D061353', 'D008401', 'D001467', 'D008055', 'D059808', 'D052617', 'D000073893']","['Amino Acids', 'Beer', 'Cold Temperature', 'Food Storage', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hordeum', 'Lipids', 'Polyphenols', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Sugars']","Influence of malt source on beer chemistry, flavor, and flavor stability.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195545,2019

The EAA content and AA composition of the dietary protein source contribute to the differential muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of different proteins. Lower EAA contents and specific lack of sufficient leucine, lysine, and/or methionine may be responsible for the lower anabolic capacity of plant-based compared with animal-based proteins. We compared EAA contents and AA composition of a large selection of plant-based protein sources with animal-based proteins and human skeletal muscle protein. AA composition of oat, lupin, wheat, hemp, microalgae, soy, brown rice, pea, corn, potato, milk, whey, caseinate, casein, egg, and human skeletal muscle protein were assessed using UPLC-MS/MS. EAA contents of plant-based protein isolates such as oat (21%), lupin (21%), and wheat (22%) were lower than animal-based proteins (whey 43%, milk 39%, casein 34%, and egg 32%) and muscle protein (38%). AA profiles largely differed among plant-based proteins with leucine contents ranging from 5.1% for hemp to 13.5% for corn protein, compared to 9.0% for milk, 7.0% for egg, and 7.6% for muscle protein. Methionine and lysine were typically lower in plant-based proteins (1.0 ± 0.3 and 3.6 ± 0.6%) compared with animal-based proteins (2.5 ± 0.1 and 7.0 ± 0.6%) and muscle protein (2.0 and 7.8%, respectively).

29732500,"Plastic materials are widely used in food packaging applications; however, there is increased concern because of the possible release of undesirable components into foodstuffs. Migration of plastic constituents not only has the potential to affect product quality but also constitutes a risk to consumer health. In order to check the safety of food contact materials, analytical methodologies to identify potential migrants are required. In the first part of this work, a GC/MS screening method was developed for the identification of components from plastic packaging materials including intentionally and ""non-intentionally added substances"" (NIAS) as potential migrants. In the second part of this study, the presence of seven compounds (bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC), benzophenone (BP)) previously identified in packaging materials were investigated in food products (corn and potatoes snacks, cookies, and cakes). For this purpose, a suitable extraction method was developed and quantification was performed using GC-MS. The developed method was validated in terms of linearity, recovery, repeatability, and limits of detection and quantification. The spiked recoveries varied between 82.7 and 116.1%, and relative standard deviation (RSD) was in the range of 2.22-15.9%.

They comprised different extraction solvents, types of cleanup [solid-phase extraction, QuEChERS, and immunoaffinity (IMA)], and calibration approaches (external or matrix-matched). The percentage of mycotoxins with acceptable recovery, according to Regulation (EC) No. 401/2006, ranged from 9 to 100%. The approach giving the highest percentage of acceptable results was selected and further tested for corn, rice, and feed spiked at three different mycotoxin levels (low, medium, and high). The method is based on extraction with MeOH-water (70 + 30, v/v) and cleanup with two multiantibody IMA columns. For corn and rice spiked at low mycotoxin levels, a significant matrix effect was observed and was compensated by using 13C calibration. At higher mycotoxin levels (medium and high), matrix effects were negligible as no significant differences were observed for the majority of recovery results calculated by 13C calibration and external calibration.

A large level of genetic diversity for anthocyanin content and composition in the grain of different species was observed. In rye, recessive mutations in six genes (vi1...vi6) lead to the absence of anthocyanins in all parts of the plant. Moreover, dominant genes of anthocyanin synthesis in aleurone (gene C) and pericarp (gene Vs) also affect the color of the grain. Reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to study anthocyanins in 24 rye samples. A lack of anthocyanins in the lines with yellow and brown grain was determined. Delphinidin rutinoside and cyanidin rutinoside were found in the green-seeded lines. Six samples with violet grains significantly varied in terms of anthocyanin composition and content. However, the main aglycone was cyanidin or peonidin in all of them. Monosaccharide glucose and disaccharide rutinose served as the glycoside units. Violet-seeded accession forms differ in the ratio of the main anthocyanins and the range of their acylated derivatives. The acyl groups were presented mainly by radicals of malonic and sinapic acids. For the colored forms, a profile of the revealed anthocyanins with the indication of their contents was given.

A diet that includes seafood with a high omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid content, more specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are known to have numerous health benefits for consumers. Improved nutrient value of the offal may also attract new market opportunities for the aquaculture industry. Tilapia were cultured on different experimental feeds that contained various levels of n-3 fatty acids from either fish oil (FO) or algae meal (AM) that were used to replace corn oil. The experimental diets included a control (corn oil 6.3%), FO1%, FO3%, FO5%, AM1.75%, AM5.26%, and AM8.77%. All diets were formulated to be isocaloric, isonitrogenous, and isolipid. Three hundred and fifty tilapia with an initial mean weight of 158±2 g were cultured in a recirculating aquaculture system (seven diets replicated at the tank level, 14 tanks, 25 fish per tank).

29574560,"A fundamental step in addressing the global problem of mycotoxins is the development of highly sensitive, multi-class extraction and detection methods. This constitutes a field of research that has in recent years enjoyed a steady advance. Such methods, generally based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, are widely reported successfully detecting various mycotoxins in different food and feed samples. In this work, an innovative approach to multi-class mycotoxin control is proposed, offering specific advantages: a broader inclusion of more mycotoxin classes, robust and thorough extraction for all target compounds despite their varied chemical properties, and determination of all analytes from a single injection. The method involved the extraction and quantification of the main mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium fungi, as well as their reported derivatives, together with 12 other compounds most commonly produced by Claviceps purpurea. The popularly reported QuEChERS technique has been reduced to a simple ""salting-out liquid-liquid extraction"" (SO-LLE) to obtain the most efficient extraction of the aforementioned mycotoxin classes in a very short time. This is in particular extremely important in ensuring correct determination of individual ergot alkaloids, for which short and robust sample preparation as well as short analytical sequences were key for minimizing the epimerization during analysis. The analyses of wheat and maize samples were performed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Matrix-matched calibration curves were established and limits of quantification were below the maximum levels established by the EU regulation. The precision (repeatability and intermediate precision) was lower than 13% in all cases and recoveries ranged between 60 and 98% in maize and between 62 and 103% in wheat, fulfilling the current legislation. The method was applied to study the co-occurrence of these mycotoxins in wheat (n = 13) and maize (n = 15) samples from six European countries.

29493670,"Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NP) may be present in food packaging, which would put consumers at risk of NP ingestion. There is little information on the amount of ZnO NP that are present in food packaging and the effects of ZnO exposure on intestinal function. To estimate physiologically relevant ZnO exposures, foods that are naturally low in zinc (Zn), but are commonly packaged with ZnO NP, such as tuna, corn, and asparagus, were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). It was found that the Zn present in a serving of these foods is approximately one hundred times higher than the recommended dietary allowance. An in vitro model of the small intestine composed of Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells was used to investigate the effects of ZnO NP exposure. Cells were exposed to physiologically realistic doses of pristine NP in culture medium and to NP subjected to an in vitro digestion to better reflect the transformation that the NP may undergo once they enter the human GI tract. Uptake and/or transport of iron (Fe), Zn, glucose, and fatty acids were assessed and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) levels were measured before and after NP exposure. The findings show that there is a 75% decrease in Fe transport and a 30% decrease in glucose transport following ZnO NP exposure.

However, many determination methods focused on a single mycotoxin, highlighting the demand for on-site determination of multiple mycotoxins in a single run. We develop a multicolor-based immunochromatographic strip (ICS) for simultaneous determination of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), zearalenone (ZEN) and T-2 toxin in maize- and cereal-based animal feeds. The nanoparticles with different colors are conjugated with three monoclonal antibodies, which serve as the immunoassay probes. The decrease in color intensity is observed by the naked eyes, providing simultaneous quantification of three mycotoxins. The visible limits of detection for AFB1, ZEN and T-2 are estimated to be 0.5, 2, and 30 ng/mL, respectively. The cut-off values are 1, 10, and 50 ng/mL, respectively. Considerable specificity and stability are found using real samples. The results are in excellent agreement with those from high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.

Evaluation of toxicokinetic changes after AFB2a-Arg formation show that the product is highly stable in biological fluids, is not metabolized by P450 enzymes, is highly plasma protein bound, has low lipid solubility, and has poor intestinal permeability/high intestinal efflux compared to AFB1. Ames' test results show that at mutagenic concentrations of AFB1, AFB2a-Arg does not have any measurable mutagenic effect which was confirmed by DNA adduct identification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Having found them in all vegetable oils tested, we focused subsequent study on oil palm products. Analysis of the chlorine isotope mass pattern exhibited in high-resolution mass spectrometry enabled organochlorine compound identification in crude palm oils as constituents of wax esters, fatty acid, diacylglycerols, and sphingolipids, which are produced endogenously in oil palm mesocarp throughout ripening. Analysis of thermal decomposition and changes during refining suggested that these naturally present organochlorine compounds in palm oils and perhaps in other vegetable oils are precursors of 3-MCPD esters.

The content of selenium (Se) and toxic trace elements, including aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and tin (Sn), in crop samples was assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry after microwave digestion of the samples. The obtained data demonstrate that cultivation of crops on seleniferous soils significantly increased Se level in wheat, mustard, rice, and maize by a factor of more than 590, 111, 85, and 64, respectively. The study also showed that Se exposure affected toxic metal content in crops. In particular, Se-rich wheat was characterized by a significant decrease in Al, As, Ni, Pb, and Sn levels. The level of As, Cd, Ni, Pb, and Sn was significantly decreased in Se-rich rice, whereas As content was increased. In turn, the decrease in Al, As, Cd, Ni, Pb, and Sn levels in Se-rich maize was associated with a significant elevation of Hg content. Finally, Se-rich mustard was characterized by a significant increase in Al, As, and Hg levels, while the content of Ni, Pb, and Sn was significantly lower than the control levels.

28982416,"An efficient, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective method based on stable isotope dilution and LC tandem MS was developed for the determination of multimycotoxins in cereals. The samples were extracted using acetonitrile-water-acetic acid (70 + 29 + 1, v/v/v), followed by dilution and centrifugation without any further cleanup. The mycotoxins were separated on a C18 column. Interference due to matrix effects was efficiently compensated for with [13C]-labeled stable isotope internal standards. The method demonstrated excellent linear relations, with regression coefficients above 0.999. Spiked recoveries at three different concentrations ranged from 80.9 to 115.9%, and RSDs were below 14% for all mycotoxins. The trueness of the method was also verified by participating in two proficiency tests, and satisfactory z-scores (|z| < 1.1) were obtained. In addition, an international interlaboratory study was organized to evaluate the methods. Eight laboratories characterized recovery, repeatability, and reproducibility studies in wheat, maize, and barley. The interlaboratory results were analyzed according to ISO 5725-2.

The difficulty of quantifying HMF in complex fried food matrices encourages the development of new analytical methods. This paper provides a rapid, sensitive and environmentally-friendly analytical method for the quantification of HMF in corn chips using HPLC-DAD. Chromatographic separation resulted in a baseline separation for HMF in 3.7 min. Sample treatment for corn chip samples first involved a leaching process using water and afterwards a solid-phase extraction (SPE) using HLB-Oasis polymeric cartridges. Sample treatment optimisation was carried out by means of Box-Behnken fractional factorial design and Response Surface Methodolog y to examine the effects of four variables (sample weight, pH, sonication time and elution volume) on HMF extraction from corn chips.

28825819,"The detecting labels used for lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs) have been traditionally gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and, more recently, luminescent nanoparticles, such as quantum dots (QDs). However, these labels have low sensitivity and are costly, in particular, for trace detection of mycotoxins in cereals. Here, we provided a simple preparation procedure for amorphous carbon nanoparticles (ACNPs) and described multiplex LFAs employing ACNPs as labels (ACNP-LFAs) for detecting three Fusarium mycotoxins. The analytical performance of ACNPs in LFA was compared to GNPs and QDs using the same immunoreagents, except for the labels, allowing for their analytical characteristics to be objectively compared. The visual limit of detection for ACNP-LFAs in buffer was 8-fold better than GNPs and 2-fold better than QDs. Under optimized conditions, the quantitative limit of detection of ACNP-LFAs in maize was as low as 20 μg/kg for deoxynivalenol, 13 μg/kg for T-2 toxin, and 1 μg/kg for zearalenone.

28784473,"Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are superfine cellulose fibrils with a nanoscale diameter and have gained increasing attention due to their great potential in the food industry. However, the applications of CNFs in active food packaging are still limited. The objectives of this study were to develop biopolymer-based edible nanocomposite films using CNFs, corn starch, and chitosan, and to investigate the effect and mechanisms of CNFs on the active functions and properties of the nanocomposite films. Important functional properties of the films were measured and the films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Zetasizer. The results demonstrate that CNFs increased the rigidity of the films due to more hydrogen bonds being induced by CNFs (≥60%). Incorporating a high content of CNFs (≥60%) in the film resulted in enhanced filling effect on the structure of the biopolymer films, which significantly improved the light barrier, oxygen barrier and water vapor barrier capacities. As CNF content increased to 100%, the film opacity increased by 59%, while the peroxide value of corn oil protected with edible films was reduced by 23%. Furthermore, the antimicrobial properties of the edible films with 80% and 100% CNFs were increased by up to 2logCFU/g on day 8 in a beef model, due to more positive charges in the films and improved blocking effects on oxygen. These results demonstrate that CNFs can effectively enhance the antimicrobial effect and barrier properties of biopolymer-based nanocomposite films and have great potential in applications of active packaging for food products.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D002482', 'D048271', 'D005516', 'D018857', 'D005519', 'D006860', 'D008855', 'D053761', 'D057139', 'D036103', 'D010100', 'D010539', 'D018583', 'D000069466', 'D013056', 'D017550', 'D013213', 'D013499', 'D014867']","['Cellulose', 'Chitosan', 'Food Microbiology', 'Food Packaging', 'Food Preservation', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Nanocomposites', 'Nanofibers', 'Nanotechnology', 'Oxygen', 'Permeability', 'Pliability', 'Red Meat', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Starch', 'Surface Properties', 'Water']",Effect and mechanism of cellulose nanofibrils on the active functions of biopolymer-based nanocomposite films.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000382', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, 'microbiology', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28784473,2019

A total of 37 compounds were tentatively identified and semi-quantified. Aldehydes were the major group present in the samples. The total volatile concentration was low, reflecting the mild aroma of the samples. Partial least squares regression was performed to identify correlations between sensory characteristics and detected aroma compounds.

Components in the saliva may aid in food digestion, whereas other components are recognized by plants as cues to elicit defense responses. Despite the ecological and economical importance of these plant-feeding insects, knowledge of their saliva composition is limited to a few species. In this study, we identified the salivary proteins of larvae of the fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda; determined qualitative and quantitative differences in the salivary proteome of the two host races-corn and rice strains-of this insect; and identified changes in total protein concentration and relative protein abundance in the saliva of FAW larvae associated with different host plants. Quantitative proteomic analyses were performed using labeling with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 98 proteins were identified (>99% confidence) in the FAW saliva. These proteins were further categorized into five functional groups: proteins potentially involved in (1) plant defense regulation, (2) herbivore offense, (3) insect immunity, (4) detoxification, (5) digestion, and (6) other functions. Moreover, there were differences in the salivary proteome between the FAW strains that were identified by label-free proteomic analyses. Thirteen differentially identified proteins were present in each strain. There were also differences in the relative abundance of eleven salivary proteins between the two FAW host strains as well as differences within each strain associated with different diets. The total salivary protein concentration was also different for the two strains reared on different host plants.

Several analytical methods have been published in the literature dealing with mycotoxins determination in cereals. Nevertheless, in the present work, the aim was to propose an easy and effective system for the extraction of six of the main mycotoxins from corn meal and durum wheat flour, i.e., the main four aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and the mycoestrogen zearalenone. The developed method exploited magnetic solid phase extraction (SPE), a technique that is attracting an increasing interest as an alternative to classical SPE. Therefore, the use of magnetic graphitized carbon black as a suitable extracting material was tested.

28415016,"Antibiotics are used in ethanol production to discourage the growth of bacteria that would result in lower ethanol content and a lower quality product. A survey conducted by the FDA (FY 2010 Nationwide Survey of Distillers Grains for Antibiotic Residues, 2009 [1]) revealed that the residues of these antibiotics can remain in the distillers grains (DG) by-product, which is used as an animal feed ingredient. The low levels of antibiotic residues in DG could be a public health concern, as they could lead to antimicrobial resistance. To enable the quantitative determination of these antibiotics (erythromycin, penicillin G, virginiamycin M1 and virginiamycin S1), we developed a sensitive LC-MS/MS method. The residues were extracted from distillers grains with a mixture of acetonitrile and buffer followed by acetonitrile. The combined extract was diluted with water and washed with hexane. An aliquot was cleaned up on an Oasis HLB solid phase extraction cartridge. Extracts were analyzed by LC-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was successfully validated using a variety of different matrices such as corn DG, corn & milo DG, and deoiled corn DG. Absolute recoveries of the analytes ranged from 53 to 106%. Accuracy ranged from 90 to 101% based on calibration by matrix standards.

Furthermore, detected frequency and odor intensity method of GC-O were applied to select key odor compounds in steamed E. sinensis. The results showed male crabs (34.06%) had a higher edible yield than female crabs (32.42%). Hepatopancreas was the most abundant portion in both genders, which contained high lipid content. Higher contents of triacylglycerols, sterols, free fatty acids, and phosphatidylethanolamine in female crabs resulted in a significant higher total lipid content in females (40.05%) than in males (37.94%). Meanwhile, total monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids of female crabs had significant higher content than male crabs, and the ratio of docosahexaenoic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid of female crabs (1.26) showed higher value than male crabs (1.18), which indicated that female crabs had higher nutritional value than male crabs. For further analyses, unique odor compounds detected in female crabs showed a plant/vegetable-like odor, while sweety, corn-like odor in male crabs.

Despite strong evidence supporting its beneficial use in agriculture, there are concerns that chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, could present a risk to terrestrial ecosystems and human health. Triclosan is one of the most commonly detected compounds in biosolids. To date, laboratory studies indicate that triclosan likely poses a de minimis risk to field crops; however, these studies were either conducted under unrealistic exposure conditions or only assessed 1 or 2 formulations of biosolids. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of triclosan on field crops in soils amended with 4 different formulations of biosolids (liquid, dewatered, compost, and alkaline-hydrolyzed), containing both background and spiked triclosan concentrations, following best management practices used in the province of Ontario. Three crop species (corn, soybean, and spring wheat) were evaluated using several plant growth endpoints (e.g., root wet mass, shoot length, shoot wet/dry mass) in 70-d to 90-d potted soil tests. The results indicated no adverse impact of triclosan on any crop-biosolids combination. Conversely, amending soil with biosolids either enhanced or had no negative effect, on the growth of plants.

27988886,"Some naturally occurring cotton accessions contain commercially attractive seed oil fatty acid profiles. The likely causal factor for a high-oleate trait in pima cotton ( Gossypium barbadense ) accession GB-713 is described here. Vegetable oils are broadly used in the manufacture of many human and animal nutritional products, and in various industrial applications. Along with other well-known edible plant oils from soybean, corn, and canola, cottonseed oil is a valuable commodity. Cottonseed oil is a co-product derived from the processing of cottonseed fiber. In the past, it was used extensively in a variety of food applications. However, cottonseed oil has lost market share in recent years due to less than optimal ratios of the constituent fatty acids found in either traditional or partially hydrogenated oil. Increased awareness of the negative health consequences of dietary trans-fats, along with the public wariness associated with genetically modified organisms has created high demand for naturally occurring oil with high monounsaturate/polyunsaturate ratios. Here, we report the discovery of multiple exotic accessions of pima cotton that contain elevated seed oil oleate content. The genome of one such accession was sequenced, and a mutant candidate fatty acid desaturase-2 (FAD2-1D) gene was identified. The mutant protein produced significantly less linoleic acid in infiltrated Arabidopsis leaf assays, compared to a repaired version of the same enzyme. Identification of this gene provides a valuable resource.

In parallel to genomic analysis, we subjected the samples to gas chromatography analysis of fatty acid composition. While the PCR-CE assay proved equally efficient as gas chromatography analysis in detecting adulteration with soybean, palm, rapeseed, sunflower, sesame, cottonseed and peanut oils, it was superior to the widely utilized analytical chemistry approach in revealing the adulterant species and detecting small quantities of corn and safflower oils in olive oil.

Also, little is known about masked and emerging toxins and metabolites. 1926 samples from 52 countries were analysed for toxins and metabolites. Of 162 compounds detected, up to 68 metabolites were found in a single sample. A subset of 1113 finished feed, maize and maize silage samples containing 57 compounds from 2012 to 2015 from 44 countries was investigated using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEN) and fumonisins showed large increases of annual medians in Europe. Within a region, distinct trends were observed, suggesting importance of local meteorology and cultivars. In 2015, median DON concentrations increased to 1400 μ g·kg - 1 in Austria, but were stable in Germany at 350 μ g·kg - 1 . In 2014, enniatins occurred at median concentrations of 250 μ g·kg - 1 in Europe, at levels similar to DON and ZEN. The latter were frequently correlated with DON-3-glucoside and ZEN-14-sulfate. Co-occurrence of regulated toxins was frequent with e.g., enniatins, and moniliformin. Correlation was observed between DON and DON-3-glucoside and with beauvericin. Results indicate that considerably more than 25% of agricultural commodities could be contaminated with mycotoxins as suggested by FAO, although this is at least partly due to the lower limits of detection in the current survey.

27556579,"Host cell proteins (HCP) are a problematic set of impurities in downstream processing (DSP) as they behave most similarly to the target protein during separation. Approaching DSP with the knowledge of HCP separation behavior would be beneficial for the production of high purity recombinant biologics. Therefore, this work was aimed at characterizing the separation behavior of complex mixtures of HCP during a commonly used method: anion-exchange chromatography (AEX). An additional goal was to evaluate the performance of a statistical methodology, based on the characterization data, as a tool for predicting protein separation behavior. Aqueous two-phase partitioning followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis provided data on the three physicochemical properties most commonly exploited during DSP for each HCP: pI (isoelectric point), molecular weight, and surface hydrophobicity. The protein separation behaviors of two alternative expression host extracts (corn germ and E. coli) were characterized. A multivariate random forest (MVRF) statistical methodology was then applied to the database of characterized proteins creating a tool for predicting the AEX behavior of a mixture of proteins. The accuracy of the MVRF method was determined by calculating a root mean squared error value for each database. This measure never exceeded a value of 0.045 (fraction of protein populating each of the multiple separation fractions) for AEX. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Here, we report the maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) gene was able to confer drought tolerance and increase grain yield in transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants. The improved of drought tolerance was associated with higher levels of proline, soluble sugar, soluble protein, and higher water use efficiency. The transgenic wheat plants had also a more extensive root system as well as increased photosynthetic capacity during stress treatments. The increased grain yield of the transgenic wheat was contributed by improved biomass, larger spike and grain numbers, and heavier 1000-grain weight under drought-stress conditions. Under non-stressed conditions, there were no significant increases in these of the measured traits except for photosynthetic rate when compared with parental wheat. Proteomic research showed that the expression levels of some proteins, including chlorophyll A-B binding protein and pyruvate, phosphate dikinase, which are related to photosynthesis, PAP fibrillin, which is involved in cytoskeleton synthesis, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, which catalyzes methionine synthesis, were induced in the transgenic wheat under drought stress.

This paper reports the identification of two new triferulic acids. 8-O-4/8-5(cyclic)-triferulic acid was synthesized from ethyl ferulate under oxidative conditions using copper(II)-tetramethylethylenediamine [CuCl(OH)-TMEDA] as a catalyst, whereas 8-8(cyclic)/5-5-triferulic acid was isolated (preparative size exclusion chromatography, reversed-phase HPLC) from saponified insoluble maize fiber. Structures of both trimers were unambiguously elucidated by high-resolution LC-ToF-MS/MS and one- ((1)H) and two-dimensional (HSQC, HMBC, COSY, NOESY) NMR spectroscopy. The newly described trimers were identified by LC-MS/MS in alkaline hydrolysates of insoluble fibers from maize, wheat, and sugar beet, indicating that ferulic acid cross-links between cell wall polymers are more diverse than previously recognized. Saponification experiments also suggest that the newly identified 8-O-4/8-5(cyclic)-triferulic acid is the naturally occurring precursor of the previously identified 8-O-4/8-5(noncyclic)-triferulic acid in plant cell walls.

A fluorescent reagent [5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl)aminofluorescein] was dispersed in aqueous normal maize or wheat starch slurries (35%, w/v) for 0, 5, 10, 30, or 60min, after which reaction was initiated by increasing the pH to 11.5 and allowing reaction to proceed for 3h. With increasing lengths of infiltration, the reaction became increasingly homogeneous within the granule interior (matrix) and the AM:AP reactivity ratio increased (wheat starch), as assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and size-exclusion chromatography (refractive index and fluorescence detection), respectively. A longer reagent infiltration time also led to a more inhibited (i.e., cross-linked) pasting viscosity, suggesting that both granular and/or molecular reaction patterns were altered by varied reagent infiltration times to ultimately impact modified starch properties.",Carbohydrate polymers,"['D007202', 'D007700', 'D009824', 'D013213', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Indicators and Reagents', 'Kinetics', 'Ointments', 'Starch', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Impact of reagent infiltration time on reaction patterns and pasting properties of modified maize and wheat starches.,"['Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27474633,2018
27453985,"Immunoreagents with good results in the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are often unable to provide the required detection limit in the traditional competitive immunochromatographic assay. The solution may be either the production of new reagents or improving the test strip. In the latter case, the assay is often performed stepwise using additional liquid reagents, but this is a significant drawback for practical use. We introduce a test strip made as a dry chemical device that still provides the two-step immunochemical interactions - formation of a complex of specific antibodies with an antigen and its detection by a conjugate of antispecies antibodies with a nano-sized label. Analysis with this test strip is similar to that with ordinary test strips and requires no additional reagents and manipulation. The use of specific antibodies and marker as two separate components allows to improve the analytical parameters. The new test significantly lowers the limit of detection, making it possible to use antibodies previously ineffective in immunochromatography. The proposed approach was tested by determining zearalenone and aflatoxin B1 mycotoxins. The visual limit of detection for aflatoxin B1 decreased to 0.6ng/mL compared to 11ng/mL with an ordinary test strip. For zearalenone, a test strip was created with visual detection limit of 6ng/mL with reagents inefficient in the traditional test strip (which is not able to detect even 9μg/mL of zearalenone). Thus, the proposed approach allows obtaining 'dry', multi-stage, immunochromatographic test strips, providing a highly sensitive detection method.

27443207,"To ensure fair competition and to protect the horse's welfare, horses have to compete on their own merits, without any unfair advantage that might follow the use of drugs. Therefore, regulatory authorities list all substances that are not allowed in competition, including most anabolic-androgenic steroids. As zero-tolerance is retained, the question arose whether the consumption of mouldy feed could lead to the excretion of steroids, due to the biotransformation of plant phytosterols to steroids. A rapid ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analytical method, previously validated according to AORC (Association of Official Racing Chemists) and EC (European Commission) guidelines, was used to measure steroids in different sample types. Multiple mouldy feed samples were tested for the presence of steroids. The effect of digestion was tested by in vitro simulation of the horse's hindgut in batch incubations. In most feed samples no steroids were detected, even when the products were mouldy. Mouldy corn however showed to contain up to 3.0 ± 0.4 µg/kg AED (4-androstenedione), the main testosterone precursor. This concentration increased when mouldy corn (with added phytosterols) was digested in vitro. An herbal phytosupplement also showed to contain α-testosterone. These results demonstrate that it is important to caution against the consumption of any feed or (herbal) supplement of which the detailed ingredients and quantitative analysis are unknown. The consumption of mouldy corn should especially be avoided, not only from a horse health and welfare point of view, but also to avoid possible inadvertent positive doping results.

The experimental results show that all of their absorption peaks exist at 1.75, 1.62, 1.1, and 0.7 THz. Absorption intensity of cellulose powder, corn, wheat husk and reed were compared in some frequencies points. It finds that corn, wheat husk and reed have higher absorption intensity than cellulose powder in early frequency domain. However, absorption intensity of cellulose powder is the strongest at 1.62 THz. Cellulose content in corn, wheat husk and reed were detected by using the method of chemical analysis. The peaks of absorption coefficient are related to their cellulose content at this frequency. It shows that plant cellulose occur lattice vibration in the frequency. Deformation, bending, flexing, and other changes appear to their functional keys. Quantum chemical calculation was carried out by using density functional theory to cellulose and the structure diagram of cellulose molecular formula was obtained. It also finds some absorption peaks exist at 0.7, 1.1, and 1.75 THz. Characterization of cellulose clusters mainly includes CH2, OH, CH, and so on. Glucose hydroxyl radical on the ring is active in the cellulose chain. Where hydroxyl related chemical reaction can occur, Hydroxyl can also be integrated into the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bond. Terahertz wave can promote hydrogen bond vibration. This kind of vibration is weak in the intermolecular interaction. The vibration and rotating happen in dipole transition. The crystal lattice rotates and is absorptive in low frequency, and large molecular skeleton vibrates. All of them can show different intensity and position of the absorption peak in the terahertz band. Corn and cellulose were analyzed by infrared spectrum. The reverse and vibration mode of cellulose was discussed. The absorption peak is basically in line with its theoretical calculating result.

The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that environmental pollution by AAs and root uptake of AAs in the polluted soil may be one of the pathways by which AAs enter the human food chain. The hypothesis driving this study was that the decay of Aristolochia clematitis L., a AA-containing herbaceous plant that is found growing widespread in the endemic regions, could release free AAs to the soil, which could be taken up by food crops growing nearby, thereby transferring this potent human nephrotoxin and carcinogen into their edible parts. Using the highly sensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection method, we identified and quantitated in this study for the first time AAs in corn, wheat grain, and soil samples collected from the endemic village Kutles in Serbia.

The objective of this study was to assess the correlation between blood and brain concentrations of pyrethroids and neurobehavioral effects in the rat following an acute oral administration of the pyrethroids as a mixture. Male Long-Evans rats were administered a mixture of β-cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and cis- and trans-permethrin in corn oil at seven dose levels. The pyrethroid with the highest percentage in the dosing solution was trans-permethrin (31% of total mixture dose) while deltamethrin and esfenvalerate had the lowest percentage (3%). Motor activity of the rats was then monitored for 1h. At 3.5h post-dosing, the animals were euthanized and blood and brain were collected. These tissues were extracted and analyzed for parent pyrethroid using HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Cypermethrin and cis-permethrin were the predominate pyrethroids detected in blood and brain, respectively, at all dosage levels. The relationship of total pyrethroid concentration between blood and brain was linear (r=0.93).

The contribution to inorganic arsenic (i-As) intake was calculated from the mean i-As content of each food (calculated by applying conversion factors to total arsenic data) and the mean consumption per day. The primary contributors to inorganic arsenic intake were wheat flour, including its proportion in wheat flour-based products (breads, pasta and cookies), followed by rice; both foods account for close to 53% and 17% of the intake, respectively.

27146636,"Aflatoxins (AFs) are hepatocarcinogenic mycotoxins that can contaminate grains and oil seeds in tropical and sub-tropical areas and have been detected in maize and peanut products of Haiti. The first objective was to assess human exposure to AFs among Haitians at an urban hospital (GHESKIO) and a rural health centre (HCBH). The second objective was to test the association between AF exposure and reported dietary intake of potentially contaminated foods, such as maize, peanut products and milk. Measurement of urinary AFM1 by HPLC revealed that among 367 participants 14% and 22% at GHESKIO and HCBH, respectively, had detectable AFM1. The maximum and median AFM1 concentrations for all detected samples were 700 pg AFM1 ml(-1) and 11.7 pg ml(-1), respectively. Detection of AFM1 was significantly associated with peanut consumption (p < 0.05). Controlling for diet and age group in a logit model, patients who reported peanut consumption the day of the survey and patients from HCBH had greater log odds of excreting detectable AFM1 (p < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively); females had lower log odds (p = 0.020). Recalled frequency of consuming non-dairy animal-sourced foods, an indicator of diet quality, approached significance (p = 0.056) as an inverse predictor of urinary AFM1 detection. The findings augur the need for interventions that will improve food safety in Haiti and limit exposure to AFs, particularly among rural communities. ","Food additives & contaminants.

In this paper, a specific quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for the detection of CPFA in cheeses was developed, and the quality parameters of the method (limit of detection, limit of quantitation, and intralaboratory precision) were assessed. Limit of detection and quantitation of CPFA were, respectively, 60 and 200 mg/kg of cheese fat, and the intralaboratory precision, determined on three concentration levels, satisfied the Horwitz equation. This method was applied to 304 samples of PDO cheeses of certified origin, including Parmigiano Reggiano (Italy), Grana Padano (Italy), Fontina (Italy), Comté (France), and Gruyère (Switzerland). Results showed that CPFA were absent in all of the cheeses whose Production Specification Rules expressly forbid the use of silages (Parmigiano Reggiano, Fontina, Comté, and Gruyère). CPFA were instead present in variable concentrations (300-830 mg/kg of fat) in all of the samples of Grana Padano cheese (silages admitted). A mix of grated Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano was also prepared, showing that the method is able to detect the counterfeiting of Parmigiano Reggiano with other cheeses up to 10-20% Grana Padano content. These results support the hypothesis that CPFA can be used as a marker of silage feedings for cheeses, and the data reported can be considered a first attempt to create a database for CPFA presence in PDO cheeses.

27076452,"An improved bioanalytical method to determine pyrethroids from small-volume (300 μL) rat liver and muscle homogenates was developed, validated, and applied to small-animal studies. The method used dispersive SPE (d-SPE) to clean the samples, and GC negative chemical ion MS (GC-NCI-MS) to analyze the samples. High-quality trace analysis of pyrethroids in biological samples was necessary to assess the health risk of environmentally encountered levels. Currently used highly sensitive methods to measure pyrethroids have focused on large-volume samples related to environmental exposure (water, soil, food products) or urine; however, there are no validated methods for quantifying this class of compounds in small-volume rat liver and muscle tissue homogenates. Individual rat tissue homogenate samples (300 μL) were prepared by protein precipitation using hexane-saturated acetonitrile. The samples were mixed on a vortex mixer and decanted into a d-SPE tube containing octadecylsilyl (C18) and primary secondary amine (PSA) sorbents and magnesium sulfate. The samples were centrifuged before evaporation to dryness. Pyrethroids were extracted and reconstituted from the residue using toluene in advance of injection into an Agilent Model 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a Model 5973 quadrupole mass analyzer. Samples were ionized via electron capture in the negative ion mode using methane as a chemical ionization gas. Six qualifying ions were monitored using selected-ion monitoring for quantitation and verification of the analyte. Cis-permethrin was used as the internal standard. Method linearity was from 1 to 500 ng/mL for muscle and liver homogenates. The inter- and intraday precision and accuracy of the method were better than 20% at the lower LOQ and better than 15% over the remainder of the linear range.

To this end, global proteomic analysis employing LC-MS/MS of gluten-enriched extracts derived from 12 barley cultivars was undertaken, providing a foundation for the development of MS-based quantitative methodologies that would enable the detection of barley contamination in foods. Subsequently, a number of candidate barley-specific peptide markers were evaluated by multiple-reaction monitoring MS. From an initial panel of 26, 9 peptide markers were unique to barley, yet present in a wide range of barley varieties. The analytical method was then used to examine a range of breakfast cereals and was able to detect barley in a barley-based breakfast cereal and a muesli, but additionally allowed detection of contamination of cereals that were comprised of ancient grains and in commercially-sourced flours, including amaranth, chia, buckwheat, millet, rice, corn, oats, rye, spelt and green wheat (0.01-0.08%).

The enforcement of legislative levels requires that measurement results are comparable over time and between methods. This is not a trivial task for gluten which comprises a large number of protein targets. This paper describes a strategy for defining a set of specific analytical targets for wheat gluten. A comprehensive proteomic approach was applied by fractionating wheat gluten using RP-HPLC (reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography) followed by a multi-enzymatic digestion (LysC, trypsin and chymotrypsin) with subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. This approach identified 434 peptide sequences from gluten. Peptides were grouped based on two criteria: unique to a single gluten protein sequence; contained known immunogenic and toxic sequences in the context of coeliac disease. An LC-MS/MS method based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for the specific detection of the target peptides.

In vitro bioassays resulted in the identification of two resistant phenotypes that were highly HR (Rf: 40-170, based on EC50) and moderately MR (Rf: 10-20) resistant to carbendazim. Cross resistance studies with other fungicides showed that all mutant strains tested were also resistant to other BMZs, such as benomyl and thiabendazole, but retained their parental sensitivity to fungicides belonging to other chemical groups. A point mutation at codon 6 (His6Asn) was found in the β2-tubulin gene of MR isolates while another mutation at codon 200 (Phe200Tyr) was present in one MR and one HR isolates. Interestingly, low temperatures suppressed MBC-resistance in all isolates bearing the H6N mutation. The three-dimensional homology model of the wild-type and mutants of β-tubulins were constructed, and the possible carbendazim binding site was analyzed. Studies on fitness parameters showed that the mutation(s) for resistance to BMZs did not affect the mycelial growth rate whereas adverse effects were found in sporulation and conidial germination in most of the resistant mutants. Pathogenicity tests on corn cobs revealed that mutants were less or equally aggressive to the wild-type strain but expressed their BMZ-resistance after inoculation on maize cobs treated with MBC.

Administration of FB1 to pregnant LM/Bc mice induces exencephaly in embryos, and ingestion of FB1-contaminated food during early pregnancy is associated with increased risk for neural tube defects (NTDs) in humans. FB1 inhibits ceramide synthase enzymes in sphingolipid biosynthesis, causing sphinganine (Sa) and bioactive sphinganine-1-phosphate (Sa1P) accumulation in blood, cells, and tissues. Sphingosine kinases (Sphk) phosphorylate Sa to form Sa1P. Upon activation, Sphk1 associates primarily with the plasma membrane, while Sphk2 is found predominantly in the nucleus. In cells over-expressing Sphk2, accumulation of Sa1P in the nuclear compartment inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, causing increased acetylation of histone lysine residues. In this study, FB1 treatment in LM/Bc mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in significant accumulation of Sa1P in nuclear extracts relative to cytoplasmic extracts. Elevated nuclear Sa1P corresponded to decreased histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and increased histone acetylation at H2BK12, H3K9, H3K18, and H3K23. Treatment of LM/Bc MEFs with a selective Sphk1 inhibitor, PF-543, or with ABC294640, a selective Sphk2 inhibitor, significantly reduced nuclear Sa1P accumulation after FB1, although Sa1P levels remained significantly increased relative to basal levels. Concurrent treatment with both PF-543 and ABC294640 prevented nuclear accumulation of Sa1P in response to FB1. Other HDAC inhibitors are known to cause NTDs, so these results suggest that FB1-induced disruption of sphingolipid metabolism leading to nuclear Sa1P accumulation, HDAC inhibition, and histone hyperacetylation is a potential mechanism for FB1-induced NTDs.

Also the technology of a postcolumn additive to complement MS/MS ensure the high-selectivity determination. In this paper, a green and sensitive analytical method was developed for the enantioselective separation and determination of isofenphos-methyl enantiomers in foodstuff and soil by SFC-MS/MS. The enantioseparation was performed within 3.50 min using Chiralpak IA-3 column with CO2/isopropanol (90:10, v/v) as the mobile phase at 2.2 mL/min flow rate. The postcolumn compensation technology provided with 0.1% formic acid/methanol greatly improved the ionization efficiency of mass spectrometry. Column temperature, auto back pressure regulator pressure, and flow rate of compensation solvent were optimized to 30 °C, 2200 psi, and 0.1 mL/min, respectively. The QuEChERs method was adopted in this study, which mean recoveries of isofenphos-methyl enantiomers ranged from 75.7% to 111.4%, with relative standard deviations less than 11.3% at three concentration levels in all matrices. The limits of detection for both enantiomers varied from 0.02 μg/kg to 0.15 μg/kg, while the limit of quantification did not exceed 0.50 μg/kg.

The participants were recruited among employees from a Campus of the University of São Paulo, which provided food samples from their homes, as well as serum and urine samples four times every three months, from June 2011 until March 2012. The probable daily intake (PDI) of aflatoxin was estimated by using the results from analysis of food products collected by the time of samples collection, and data from a 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire. Analyses of AFB1 and AFM1 in food samples were conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Biomarkers in serum and urine were determined by tandem mass spectrometry. AFB1 and AFM1 were detected in 38 samples of cereals (28%, N=136) and 31 milk products (36%, N=86), respectively. AFB1-lysine and AFB1-N(7)-guanine and were not detected in serum or urine samples, respectively. However, AFM1 was found in 74 urine samples (65%), at mean levels in the 4 sampling times ranging from 0.37±0.23 to 1.70±2.88pg/mg creatinine. The mean PDI varied among different sampling times, ranging from 0.09±0.09 to 1.35±5.98ng/kg body weight/day. A modest though significant correlation (r=0.45; p=0.03; N=23) was found for the first time in Brazil between the AFM1 concentration in urine and the PDI for total aflatoxins (AFB1+AFM1) in sampling 1 (June 2011). Urinary AFM1 was confirmed as very sensitive for monitoring the human exposure to dietary aflatoxin. Further studies using serum and urinary biomarkers are needed to estimate the aflatoxin exposure of populations in higher risk areas in Brazil.

In this work, we describe a homologous and high-throughput multi-wavelength fluorescence polarization immunoassay (MWFPIA) for the multiplexed detection of mycotoxins. Three typical Fusarium mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON), T-2 toxin and fumonisin B1 (FB1), were labeled with different dyes. Tracers and specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were employed in the MWFPIA to simultaneously detect the three mycotoxins. Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection using MWFPIA were 242.0 μg kg(-1) for DON, 17.8 μg kg(-1) for T-2 toxin and 331.5 μg kg(-1) for FB1, providing sufficient sensitivity to meet the action levels of these three contaminants in maize as set by the European Union. The use of a methanol/water (2:3, v/v) mixture for sample pretreatment allowed recoveries ranging from 76.5-106.3%, with coefficients of variation less than 21.7%. The total time of analysis, including sample preparation, was less than 30 min. Twenty naturally contaminated maize samples were tested using MWFPIA and HPLC-MS/MS, with correlation coefficients (R(2)) of 0.97 for DON and 0.99 for FB1.

Their presence as contaminants in food systems has become a significant concern in recent years. For example, PAs are often found as contaminants in honey through pollen transfer. A validated method was developed for the quantification of four pyrrolizidine alkaloids and one pyrrolizidine alkaloid N-oxide in plants and honey grown and produced in British Columbia. The method was optimised for extraction efficiency from the plant materials and then subjected to a single-laboratory validation to assess repeatability, accuracy, selectivity, LOD, LOQ and method linearity. The PA content in plants ranged from1.0 to 307.8 µg/g with repeatability precision between 3.8 and 20.8% RSD. HorRat values were within acceptable limits and ranged from 0.62 to 1.63 for plant material and 0.56-1.82 for honey samples. Method accuracy was determined through spike studies with recoveries ranging from 84.6 to 108.2% from the raw material negative control and from 82.1-106.0 % for the pyrrolizidine alkaloids in corn syrup. Based on the findings in this single-laboratory validation, this method is suitable for the quantitation of lycopsamine, senecionine, senecionine N-oxide, heliosupine and echimidine in common comfrey (Symphytum officinale), tansy ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), blueweed (Echium vulgare) and hound's tongue (Cynoglossum officinale) and for PA quantitation in honey and found that PA contaminants were present at low levels in BC honey.","Food additives & contaminants.

Unsaturated FAMEs show significantly different gas phase absorption profiles than saturated ones, and these classes can be easily distinguished with the VUV detector. Another advantage includes differentiating cis/trans-isomeric FAMEs (e.g. oleic acid methyl ester and linoleic acid methyl ester isomers) and the ability to use VUV data analysis software for deconvolution of co-eluting signals. As a universal detector, VUV also provides high specificity, sensitivity, and a fast data acquisition rate, making it a powerful tool for fatty acid screening when combined with gas chromatography.

We determined actual sugar content by conducting a blinded laboratory analysis in infant formulas, breakfast cereals, packaged baked goods and yogurts. One hundred samples were sent to an independent laboratory for analysis via gas chromatography. Sugar content and composition was determined and total sugar was compared against nutrition labels. Of the 100 samples analyzed, 74% contained ≥20% of total calories per serving from added sugars. Nutrient label data underestimated or overestimated actual sugars and ~25% of all samples had actual total sugar values that were either <10% or >10% of labeled total sugar. Many products that are frequently marketed to and consumed by infants and young children contain sugars in amounts that differ from nutrition labels and often in excess of recommended daily levels.

26065425,"A critical assessment of three previously published indirect methods based on acidic hydrolysis using superacids for the determination of ""free"" and ""total"" deoxynivalenol (DON) was carried out. The modified mycotoxins DON-3-glucoside (D3G), 3-acetyl-DON (3ADON), and 15-acetyl-DON (15ADON) were chosen as model analytes. The initial experiments focused on the stability/degradation of DON under hydrolytic conditions and the ability to release DON from the modified forms. Acidic conditions that were capable of cleaving D3G, 3ADON, and 15ADON to DON were not found, raising doubts over the efficacy of previously published indirect methods for total DON determination. Validation of these indirect methods for wheat, maize, and barley using UHPLC-MS/MS was performed in order to test the accuracy of the generated results. Validation data for DON, D3G, 3ADON, and 15ADON in nonhydrolyzed and hydrolyzed matrices were obtained. Under the tested conditions, DON was not released from D3G, 3ADON, or 15ADON after hydrolysis and thus none of the published methods were able to cleave the modified forms of DON. In addition to acids, alkaline hydrolysis with KOH for an extended time and at elevated temperatures was also tested. 3ADON and 15ADON were cleaved under the alkaline pH caused by the addition of KOH or aqueous K2CO3 to ""neutralize"" the acidic sample extracts in the published studies. The published additional DON increase after hydrolysis may have been caused by huge differences in matrix effects and the recovery of DON in nonhydrolyzed and hydrolyzed matrices as well as by the alkaline cleavage of 3ADON or 15ADON after the neutralization of hydrolyzed extracts.

The oil spread test as a screening method was used to evaluate biosurfactant production by the yeast HG5 isolate. The 5.8s-rDNA analysis confirmed that the isolated yeast was related to Lachancea thermotolerans. We named this strain Lachancea thermotolerans strain BBMCZ7FA20 and its 5.8s-rDNA sequence was deposited in GenBank, NCBI under accession number of KM042082.1. The best precursor of biosurfactant production was canola oil and the sophorolipid amount was measured for 24.2 g/l.

The observed analytical values using isotope-labeled internal standards were more accurate for most target pesticides than that obtained using the external calibration method, but were still biased from the spiked concentrations when a matrix-free calibration solution was used for calibration. The respective calibration curves for each target pesticide were also prepared using matrix-free calibration solutions and matrix-matched calibration solutions with blank soybean extract. The intensity ratio of the peaks of most target pesticides to that of the corresponding isotope-labeled internal standards was influenced by the presence of the matrix in the calibration solution; therefore, the observed slope varied. The ratio was also influenced by the type of injection method (splitless or on-column).

25874803,"Aflatoxin B1 poses grave threats to food and feed safety due to its strong carcinogenesis and toxicity, thus requiring ultrasensitive rapid on-site determination. Herein, a portable immunosensor based on chromatographic time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay was developed for sensitive and on-site determination of aflatoxin B1 in food and feed samples. Chromatographic time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay offered a magnified positive signal and low signal-to-noise ratio in time-resolved mode due to the absence of noise interference caused by excitation light sources. Compared with the immunosensing performance in previous studies, this platform demonstrated a wider dynamic range of 0.2-60 μg/kg, lower limit of detection from 0.06 to 0.12 µg/kg, and considerable recovery from 80.5% to 116.7% for different food and feed sample matrices. It was found to be little cross-reactivity with other aflatoxins (B2, G1, G2, and M1). In the case of determination of aflatoxin B1 in peanuts, corn, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and mouse feed, excellent agreement was found when compared with aflatoxin B1 determination via the conversational high-performance liquid chromatography method. The chromatographic time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay affords a powerful alternative for rapid on-site determination of aflatoxin B1 and holds a promise for food safety in consideration of practical food safety and environmental monitoring.

Co-CFP temperature and a parameter called hydrogen to carbon effective ratio (H/C(eff) ratio) were examined for their effects on the relative content of aromatics. Experimental results showed that co-CFP temperature of 600 °C was optimal for the formation of aromatics and other organic pyrolysis products. Besides, H/C(eff) ratio had an important influence on product distribution. The yield of total organic pyrolysis products and relative content of aromatics increased non-linearly with increasing H/C(eff) ratio.

25849036,"A dose-response study was carried out to examine the carryover of zearalenone (ZEN), deoxynivalenol (DON) and their metabolites into bovine milk. Therefore, a feeding trial with 30 dairy cows fed with three different levels of Fusarium (FUS) toxin-contaminated maize was performed. A control group (0.02 mg ZEN kg(-1) dry matter (DM) and 0.07 DON kg(-1) DM) was compared with two groups fed contaminated diets. The first diet contained 0.33 mg ZEN kg(-1) DM and 2.62 mg DON kg(-1) DM (group FUS-50) and the second diet contained 0.66 mg ZEN kg(-1) DM and 5.24 mg DON kg(-1) DM (group FUS-100). For milk sample analysis, a new cost-efficient sample preparation method was developed for the simultaneous determination of ZEN, DON and their metabolites. The method comprised the separation of the milk fat followed by an SPE clean-up on Oasis HLB and a LC-MS/MS measurement. The less toxic metabolite de-epoxy-DON had the highest detected concentration (5.6 ng ml(-1) milk) in the milk samples obtained from the feeding trial. Additionally, ZEN (up to 0.29 ng ml(-1)), α-zearalenol (up to 0.17 ng ml(-1)), β-zearalenol (up to 0.95 ng ml(-1)) and DON (up to 2.5 ng ml(-1)) were detected in these samples. The milk toxin concentrations of cows fed the control diet were significantly lower compared with cows fed the contaminated diet. The calculated carryover rates ranged between 0 and 0.0075 for ZEN and metabolites and between 0 and 0.0017 for DON independent of exposure. It can be concluded that dietary toxin concentrations in the feed below or close to the current guidance values do not pose a risk for consumers due to negligible carryover rates.","Food additives & contaminants.

25793414,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) are mycotoxins produced by fungi of the genus Fusarium which frequently contaminate maize and grain cereals. Mycotoxin-contaminated feed endangers animal health and leads to economic losses in animal production. Several mycotoxin elimination strategies, including the use of commercially available DON and ZEN detoxifying agents, have been developed. However, frequently there is no scientific proof of the efficacy of such adsorbents and degrading products. We therefore tested 20 commercially available products claiming to detoxify DON and/or ZEN either by biodegradation (4 products) or a combination of degradation and adsorption (16 products) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at approx. pH 7. Under the applied conditions, a complete reduction of DON and consequent formation of the known non-toxic metabolite DOM-1 was exclusively observed in samples taken from the anaerobic degradation experiment of one product. For all other products, incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, a maximum DON reduction of 17% after 72 h of incubation was detected. Aerobic and anaerobic incubation of only one tested product resulted in complete ZEN reduction as well as in the formation of the less-toxic metabolites DHZEN and HZEN. With this product, 68-97% of the toxin was metabolised within 3 h. After 24 h, a ZEN reduction ≥ 60% was obtained with four additional products during aerobic incubation only. Six of the 20 investigated products produced α- and/or β-ZEL, which are metabolites showing similar oestrogenic activity compared to ZEN. Aerobic and anaerobic degradation to unknown metabolites with unidentified toxicity was obtained with 10 and 3 products, respectively.

25667313,"Tricin was recently discovered in lignin preparations from wheat (Triticum aestivum) straw and subsequently in all monocot samples examined. To provide proof that tricin is involved in lignification and establish the mechanism by which it incorporates into the lignin polymer, the 4'-O-β-coupling products of tricin with the monolignols (p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols) were synthesized along with the trimer that would result from its 4'-O-β-coupling with sinapyl alcohol and then coniferyl alcohol. Tricin was also found to cross couple with monolignols to form tricin-(4'-O-β)-linked dimers in biomimetic oxidations using peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide or silver (I) oxide. Nuclear magnetic resonance characterization of gel permeation chromatography-fractionated acetylated maize (Zea mays) lignin revealed that the tricin moieties are found in even the highest molecular weight fractions, ether linked to lignin units, demonstrating that tricin is indeed incorporated into the lignin polymer. These findings suggest that tricin is fully compatible with lignification reactions, is an authentic lignin monomer, and, because it can only start a lignin chain, functions as a nucleation site for lignification in monocots. This initiation role helps resolve a long-standing dilemma that monocot lignin chains do not appear to be initiated by monolignol homodehydrodimerization as they are in dicots that have similar syringyl-guaiacyl compositions. The term flavonolignin is recommended for the racemic oligomers and polymers of monolignols that start from tricin (or incorporate other flavonoids) in the cell wall, in analogy with the existing term flavonolignan that is used for the low-molecular mass compounds composed of flavonoid and lignan moieties.

The effectiveness of functional barrier layers was investigated in coloured polystyrene (PS) bowls due to their intended condition of use with hot liquids such as soups or stew. Migration experiments were performed over a 10-day period using USFDA-recommended food simulants (10% ethanol, 50% ethanol, corn oil and Miglyol) along with several other food oils. At the end of the 10 days, solvent dyes had migrated from the PS bowls at 12, 1 and 31,000 ng cm(-)(2) into coconut oil, palm kernel oil and Miglyol respectively, and in coconut oil and Miglyol the colour change was visible to the human eye. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed that the functional barrier was no longer intact for the bowls exposed to coconut oil, palm kernel oil, Miglyol, 10% ethanol, 50% ethanol and goat's milk. Additional tests showed that 1-dodecanol, a lauryl alcohol derived from palm kernel oil and coconut oil, was present in the PS bowls at an average concentration of 11 mg kg(-1). This compound is likely to have been used as a dispersing agent for the solvent dye and aided the migration of the solvent dye from the PS bowl into the food simulant. The solvent dye was not found in the 10% ethanol, 50% ethanol and goat's milk food simulants above their respective limits of detection, which is likely to be due to its insolubility in aqueous solutions. A disrupted barrier layer is of concern because if there are unregulated materials in the inner layers of the laminate, they may migrate to food, and therefore be considered unapproved food additives resulting in the food being deemed adulterated under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.","Food additives & contaminants.

29363933,"Mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA) is a widespread contaminant of raw cereal grains with nephrotoxic activity. Сereal-based baby foods (BF) are an important component of the infant diet. In Russia, the presence of OTA in grainbased BF is not allowed (<0.5 ng/kg), in the EU maximum limit of toxin in BF is 0.5 ng/kg. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) set for OTA a provisional tolerable weekly intake of 100 ng/kg bw; the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) – 120 ng/kg bw. The purpose of this study was to investigate the OTA content in BF (infant cereals and canned food) and assess the relevant risk to the health of children first year of life. The analysis of OTA was performed by immunoaffinity column clean-up and high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The limit of detection and limit of quantification for OTA were 0.10 and 0.50 ng/kg, respectively. The content of OTA in BF was represented as maximum (Max), mean (M), median (Мe) and 90 percentile (90%) of all samples. The 554 BF samples based on corn, rice, buckwheat, millet, wheat, oats, barley, and mixtures of cereals were studied. OTA was detected in 32 samples of BF: in 30 of the 312 samples of infant cereals (Max – 4.95 ng/kg; M – 0.09 ng/kg, Me and 90% – 0 ng/kg) and in 2 of the 242 samples of canned food (0.34 and 0.37 ng/kg). 20 samples of BF were contaminated with OTA above the maximum limit (≥0.50 ng/kg). BF, exhibited the highest incidence of OTA, were buckwheat-based (13 of 41 samples, Max – 2.52 ng/kg, M – 0.36 ng/kg, Me – 0 ng/kg, 90% – 1.57 ng/kg) and mixed-grain (12 of 115 samples, Max – 4.95 ng/kg, M – 0.10 ng/kg, Me – 0 ng/kg, 90% – 0.14 ng/kg) infant cereals. OTA was also detected in 2 of 40 samples of oat-based infant cereals (0.19 and 0.60 ng/kg), in 2 of 72 samples of rice-based infant cereals (0.18 and 0.48 ng/kg) and in 1 of 37 samples of wheat-based infant cereals (0.13 ng/kg). None of the 4 samples of corn-based and of the 3 samples of millet-based infant cereals contained OTA. Calculations showed that for infants the daily ochratoxin A dietary intake did not exceed 6.8 ng/kg bw. This value of OTA intake is below the levels, proposed as tolerable intake. Thus, one can conclude that cereal-based BF (infant cereals and canned food) are moderately contaminated with OTA and there is not a significant toxicological risk to the health of children of first year of life.

The synthesis mechanism of the h-MIMs has been studied. The h-MIMs exhibited bigger specific surface area and much higher binding capacity than the molecularly imprinted polymers prepared by precipitation polymerization (p-MIPs) and surface polymerization (s-MIPs). Besides, the adsorption rate of h-MIMs to prometryn was significantly higher than that of p-MIPs and s-MIPs. Owing to the hollow structure of the h-MIMs, more binding cavities were located on the inner and outer surfaces of the h-MIMs, which could facilitate the removal of template molecules from the polymers and the rebinding of the target molecules to the polymers. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limits of triazines are in the range of 0.08-0.16ngg(-1). At the spiked level (5ngg(-1)), the recoveries of triazines are in the range of 81±4% to 96±4%.

The optimal QB-ICA exhibits good dynamic linear detection for ZEN over the range of 0.125 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL with a median inhibitory concentration of 1.01±0.09 ng/mL (n=3). The detection limits for ZEN in a standard solution and real corn sample (dilution ratio of 1:30) are 0.0625 ng/mL and 3.6 µg/kg, respectively, which is much better than that of a previously reported gold nanoparticle-based ICA method. Forty-six natural corn samples are assayed using both QB-ICA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The two methods show a highly significant correlation (R(2)=0.92).

25463210,"In most cases of mycotoxin detection, quantitation is critical while immunochromatographic strip tests are qualitative in nature. Moreover, the sensitivity of this technique is questioned. In order to overcome these limitations, an ultrasensitive and quantitative immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for rapid and sensitive quantitation of ochratoxin A (OTA) was developed. The assay was based on a competitive format and its sensitivity was improved by using a sensitive and selective OTA monoclonal antibody (OTA-mAb). The visible ICA results were obtained within 15 min, and in addition to visual examination, they were read by the rapid color intensity portable strip reader. The visual and computational detection limits (vLOD and cLOD, respectively) for ochratoxin A were 0.2 and 0.25 ng mL(-1), respectively. These values were lower than those reported by previous studies in a range 5-2500 folds. For validation, contaminated samples including wheat, maize, rice and soybean were assayed by ICA and a standard high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results were in good agreement for both ICA and HPLC methods. The average recoveries of the HPLC were in the range 72-120% while the ICA values were from 76 to 104%, confirming the accuracy and sensitivity of this method.","Journal of chromatography.

25440660,"Two different approaches were used to improve the capabilities of solid sampling (SS) electrothermal vaporization (ETV) coupled to inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for the direct analysis of powdered rice. Firstly, a cooling step immediately before and after the vaporization step in the ETV temperature program resulted in a much sharper analyte signal peak. Secondly, point-by-point internal standardization with an Ar emission line significantly improved the linearity of calibration curves obtained with an increasing amount of rice flour certified reference material (CRM). Under the optimized conditions, detection limits ranged from 0.01 to 6ngg(-1) in the solid, depending on the element and wavelength selected. The method was validated through the quantitative analysis of corn bran and wheat flour CRMs. Application of the method to the multi-elemental analysis of 4-mg aliquots of real organic long grain rice (white and brown) also gave results for Al, As, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Se, Pb and Zn in agreement with those obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry following acid digestion of 0.2-g aliquots. As the analysis takes roughly 5min per sample (2.5min for grinding, 0.5-1min for weighing a 4-mg aliquot and 87s for the ETV program), this approach shows great promise for fast screening of food samples.

The mycotoxins are extracted with a mixture of methanol/water, diluted with water and 0.1% formic acid and then analyzed by LC-HESI-MS/MS in a single 12 min run in positive mode. Multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) is applied by using two abundant fragments for each mycotoxin. Matrix effects are compensated using external matrix-matched calibration curves. Recoveries, calculated by spiking blank maize samples, ranging from 95.2% to 113.4%, were in accordance with the performance criteria required by the European Commission and intraday reproducibility ranged from 4.2% to 13.2%.

We surveyed food intake and estimated the risk of exposures to aflatoxin and fumonisin mycotoxins for infants less than 6 months of age in Northern Tanzania. A total of 143 infants were progressively recruited and three follow-up visits were made at 1, 3 and 5 months of age. A 24-h dietary recall technique was used to estimate flour intake of infants who had been introduced to maize foods. Aflatoxins and fumonisins in the flours were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography technique. Exposure to aflatoxins or fumonisins was estimated using the deterministic approach. By the age of 3 months, 98 infants had started taking food; 67 of them, maize flours at levels ranging from 0.57 to 37.50 g per infant per day (average 8 g per infant per day). Fifty-eight per cent of 67 maize flour samples contained detectable aflatoxins (range 0.33-69.47 μg kg(-1) ; median 6 μg kg(-1) ) and 31% contained detectable fumonisins (range 48-1224 μg kg(-1) ; median 124 μg kg(-1) ). For infants who consumed contaminated flours, aflatoxin exposure ranged from 0.14 to 120 ng kg(-1) body weight (BW) per day (all above the health concern level of 0.017 ng kg(-1) BW per day as recommended by the European Food Safety Agency) and fumonisin exposure ranged from 0.005 to 0.88 μg kg(-1) BW per day.

STC is a precursor of the carcinogen aflatoxin B1 and exerts carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic effects. A reliable GC-MS-based analytical method using on-column injection was developed and validated to determine STC content in grain. In this method, STC was extracted with acetonitrile (84%), and the filtered extract was diluted with phosphate buffer before immunoaffinity column (IAC) cleanup. After elution and N2 evaporation, the sample containing STC was dissolved in acetone and injected into the GC-MS system without derivatization. Separation of STC was carried out by a capillary column (0.25 mm i.d.×30 m, 0.25 μm) with a deactivated pre-column (0.53 mm i.d.×0.6 m). The matrix effect was investigated in maize, wheat, and rice, and an insignificant matrix effect was observed after IAC cleanup.

There is a need to deplete the vicilins from maize embryo extracts for enhanced proteomics analysis. We here reported a chloroform-assisted phenol extraction (CAPE) method for vicilin depletion. By CAPE, maize embryo proteins were first extracted in an aqueous buffer, denatured by chloroform and then subjected to phenol extraction. We found that CAPE can effectively deplete the vicilins from maize embryo extract, allowing the detection of low-abundance proteins that were masked by vicilins in 2-DE gel. The novelty of CAPE is that it selectively depletes abundant storage proteins from embryo extracts of both monocot (maize) and dicot (soybean and pea) seeds, whereas other embryo proteins were not depleted. CAPE can significantly improve proteome profiling of embryos and extends the application of chloroform and phenol extraction in plant proteomics.

The biodiesel samples were prepared using n-propanol as an emulsifier, 10% (v/v) nitric acid as the aqueous phase, and biodiesel. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed to determine the microemulsion region with the specified components. The optimized conditions for microemulsion formation were 57.6% (v/v) n-propanol, 21.2% (v/v) biodiesel, and 21.2% (v/v) nitric acid solution. The stability of the microemulsified system was investigated using aqueous and organic standards, and the system was found to be stable for at least 240 min. The applied pyrolysis and atomization temperatures were 800 and 2000 °C, respectively, and 5 μg of aluminum was used as the chemical modifier. The obtained limits of detection and quantification were 0.2 and 0.5 μg kg(-1), respectively, and the characteristic mass was 1.6 pg. The precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation (% R.S.D., n = 10), was 2.5% for a sample with a cadmium concentration of 6.5 μg kg(-1). The accuracy was determined from addition and recovery experiments, with results varying from 93 to 108% recovery. This study demonstrates that the proposed method based on the use of a microemulsion formation in sample preparation can be applied as an efficient alternative for the determination of cadmium in biodiesel by GFAAS. Cadmium determination in biodiesel samples of different origins (soybean, corn, cotton, and sunflower) was evaluated after acid digestion using the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique, and the obtained results were compared to the results obtained using the proposed method.

Essential oil (EO) of oregano variety Mendocino (OMen), Cordobes (OCor), and Compacto (OCom), mint variety Inglesa (Mi), and Pehaujo (Mp), Suico (Sui); rosemary (Ro), and Aguaribay (Ag) were tested in vitro against 4 corn fungi: A. flavus (CCC116-83 and BXC01), P. oxalicum (083296), and P. minioluteum (BXC03). The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined. The chemical profiles of the EOs were analyzed by GC-MS. Lipid oxidation in cell membrane of fungi was determined by hydroperoxides and related with essential oil antifungal activity.

After 1, 3, 8, 15, 22 and 29 days, four piglets per group were slaughtered. The simultaneous determination of all analytes was carried out using a sensitive and selective in-house-validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method after sample preparation with Oasis™ HLB columns. ZEN, α-ZEL, DON and de-DON were detected in serum, whereas in liquor only ZEN, DON and de-DON were found at lower concentrations. In urine, all analytes were detected in considerably higher concentrations as in serum and liquor, whereby α- and β-ZAL could only be detected sporadically. Apart from ZEN in liquor and α- and β-ZAL in urine, the mycotoxin concentrations increased with increasing concentrations of Fusarium toxins in the diet. The toxin intake per kg body weight 3-4 h prior to slaughtering correlated well with the DON and the sum of DON and de-DON concentrations in all three specimens as well as with the ZEN, α-ZEL and the sum of ZEN and metabolite concentrations in urine. Due to the high correlation between the dietary DON concentration and the DON (r = 0.855) and the sum of DON and de-DON (r = 0.870) concentration in serum, the exposure to DON can be evaluated. Moreover, serum levels of these toxins indicative of an exceeding of the guidance value in feed can be established using the corresponding regression equations.

25350353,"Zein protein was extracted from the by-product corn gluten meal. The obtained zein protein was 1st hydrolyzed by 4 different proteases. The antioxidant activities of the hydrolysates or peptides were evaluated by free radical scavenging activity, metal ion chelating activity, and lipid peroxidation inhibitory capacity. Among hydrolysates produced, alkaline protease hydrolysates exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. A regression model was established by uniform design to optimize the alkaline protease hydrolysis conditions. The hydrolysates with molecular weight < 3 kDa obtained from ultrafiltration showed the highest antioxidant activities in all relevant assays. The hydrolysates with molecular weight <3 kDa were subsequently purified by gel filtration chromatography, and fraction F3 exhibited the highest antioxidant activities. Two peptides were identified from fraction F3 using LC-ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS as Pro-Phe (263.13 Da) and Leu-Pro-Phe (375.46 Da). These peptides exhibited good free radical scavenging activity and lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect.

For this purpose, a specific anti-ZEN monoclonal antibody (mAb), 4A3-F9, was obtained and identified. ZEN coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) via 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether was prepared as immunogen. The mAb showed low cross-reactivity with five ZEN analogues. Using an antibody preparation with a titer of ≥1:5.12 × 10(5), the cross-reactivity (CR) of the anti-ZEN monoclonal antibody with four of the analogues was <4%, except for zearalanone, which was 53.121%. The recovery rates of ZEN in spiked corn samples were in the range of 91.30-97.07% with coefficients of variation <5.32%. An immunochromatographic strip was developed using the specific anti-ZEN monoclonal antibody and applied to the screening of corn samples for ZEN residues. The test could be accomplished within 5-10 min. The sensitivity of the test strip in corn sample extract was confirmed to be 20 μg/kg by unaided visual assessment, and the IC50 was calculated as 3.4 ng/mL using a test strip reader.

To decrease the methanol content of the brewed wine, atmospheric and room-temperature plasma (ARTP) was used as a new mutagenesis tool to generate a mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with lower methanol content. Headspace gas chromatography was used to determine the identity and concentration of methanol with butyl acetate as internal standard in brewed wine. With 47.4% higher and 26.3% positive mutation rates were obtained, the ARTP jet exhibited a strong effect on mutation breeding of S. cerevisiae. The mutant S. cerevisiae S12 exhibited the lowest methanol content, which was decreased by 72.54% compared with that of the wild-type strain. Subsequently, the mutant S. cerevisiae S12 was used to ferment different combinations of malt and adjuncts for lower methanol content and higher alcoholic content. It was shown that the culture 6#, which was 60% malt, 20% wheat, and 20% corn, was the best combinations of malt and adjuncts, with the lowest methanol content (104.8 mg/L), and a relatively higher alcoholic content (15.3%, v/v). The optimal malt-adjunct culture 6#, treated with the glucoamylase dose of 0.04 U/mg of grain released the highest reducing sugars (201.6 mg/mL).

25266165,"The European corn borer (ECB) plays an important role in promoting Fusarium verticillioides infections and in the consequent fumonisin contamination in maize grain in temperate areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the ECB feeding activity could also affect the occurrence of emerging mycotoxins in maize kernels. During the 2008-10 period, natural infestation of the insect was compared, in field research, with the protection of infestation, which was obtained by using an entomological net. The ears collected in the protected plots were free from ECB attack, while those subject to natural insect attacks showed a damage severity that varied from 10% to 25%. The maize samples were analysed by means of an LC-MS/MS-based multi-mycotoxin method, which led to the detection of various metabolites: fumonisins (FUMs), fusaproliferin (FUS), moniliformin (MON), bikaverin (BIK), beauvericin (BEA), fusaric acid (FA), equisetin (EQU), deoxynivalenol (DON), deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (DON-3-G), zearalenone (ZEA), culmorin (CULM), aurofusarin (AUR) and butenolide (BUT). The occurrence of mycotoxins produced by Fusarium spp. of Liseola section was affected significantly by the ECB feeding activity. The presence of ECB injuries increased the FUMs from 995 to 4694 µg kg(-1), FUS from 17 to 1089 µg kg(-1), MON from 22 to 673 µg kg(-1), BIK from 58 to 377 µg kg(-1), BEA from 6 to 177 µg kg(-1), and FA from 21 to 379 µg kg(-1). EQU, produced by F. equiseti section Gibbosum, was also increased by the ECB activity, by 1-30 µg kg(-1) on average. Instead, the content of mycotoxins produced by Fusarium spp. of Discolor and Roseum sections was not significantly affected by ECB activity. As for FUMs, the application of a strategy that can reduce ECB damage could also be the most effective solution to minimise the other mycotoxins produced by Fusarium spp. of Liseola section.","Food additives & contaminants.

The HPLC method was used for the simultaneous determination of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), B2 (AFB2), G1 (AFG1) and G2 (AFG2) in various cereals and grains. Samples were extracted with 80:20 (v/v) methanol:water and purified using C18 (40-63 μm) solid-phase extraction cartridges. AFs were separated using a LiChroCART-RP-18 (5 μm, 250 × 4.0 mm(2)) column. The mobile phase consisted of methanol:acetonitrile:buffer (17.5:17.5:65 v/v) (pH 7.4) delivered at the flow rate of 1.0 mL min(-1) The fluorescence of each AF was detected at λex = 365 nm and λem = 435 nm. All four AFs were properly resolved within the total run time of 20 min. The established method was extensively validated as a final verification of the method development by the evaluation of selectivity (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2), linearity (R(2) ≥ 0.9994), precision (average SD ≤ 2.79), accuracy (relative mean error ≤ -5.51), robustness (p < 0.0080), ruggedness (p < 0.0100) and average recoveries (89.2-97.8%). The limits of quantification of AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2 were 0.080, 0.073, 0.062 and 0.066 ng g(-1), respectively. Finally, the developed method was applied for the analysis of AFs in 45 samples comprising rice (n = 20), wheat (n = 15) and maize (n = 10). The results showed that 65% of rice, 20% of wheat and 80% of maize samples were found contaminated with AFs. Thus, according to the achieved results, it is suggested that the newly developed HPLC method could be effectively applied for the routine analysis of the AFs in different cereals and grains.

25225408,"Although in modern societies fermented beverages are associated with socializing, celebration, and ritual, in ancient times they were also importa`nt sources of essential nutrients and potable water. In Mesoamerica, pulque, an alcoholic beverage produced from the fermented sap of several species of maguey plants (Agavaceae; Fig. 1) is hypothesized to have been used as a dietary supplement and risk-buffering food in ancient Teotihuacan (150 B.C. to A.D. 650). Although direct archaeological evidence of pulque production is lacking, organic residue analysis of pottery vessels offers a new avenue of investigation. However, the chemical components of alcoholic beverages are water-soluble, greatly limiting their survival over archaeological timescales compared with hydrophobic lipids widely preserved in food residues. Hence, we apply a novel lipid biomarker approach that considers detection of bacteriohopanoids derived from the ethanol-producing bacterium Zymomonas mobilis for identifying pulque production/consumption in pottery vessels. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry selected ion monitoring (m/z 191) of lipid extracts of >300 potsherds revealed characteristic bacteriohopanoid distributions in a subset of 14 potsherds. This hopanoid biomarker approach offers a new means of identifying commonly occurring bacterially fermented alcoholic beverages worldwide, including palm wine, beer, cider, perry, and other plant sap- or fruit-derived beverages [Swings J, De Ley J (1977) Bacteriol Rev 41(1):1-46].

Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) ratio in a contaminated sample is generally greater than 50% of total aflatoxin (sum of aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, and G2). In Malawi, the aflatoxin occurrence ratios were determined by examining LC-MS/MS and HPLC fluorescence detection (FLD) data of 156 naturally contaminated raw maize and 80 groundnut samples collected in 2011 and 2012. Results showed that natural aflatoxin occurrence ratio differed. In 47% of the samples, the concentration of AFG1 was higher than that of AFB1. The mean concentration percentages of AFB1/AFB2/AFG1/AFG2 in reference to total aflatoxins were found to be 47:5:43:5%, respectively. The AFG1 and AFB1 50/50 trend was observed in maize and groundnuts and was consistent for samples collected in both years.

25175039,"An LC-MS/MS ""dilute and shoot"" method for the determination of 295 fungal and bacterial metabolites was optimized and validated according to the guidelines established in the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs of the European Commission (SANCO) document No. 12495/2011. Four different types of food matrices were chosen for validation: apple puree for infants (high water content), hazelnuts (high fat content), maize (high starch and low fat content) and green pepper (difficult or unique matrix). Method accuracy and precision was evaluated using spiked samples in five replicates at two concentration levels. Method trueness was demonstrated through participation in various proficiency tests. Although the method covers a total number of 331 analytes, validation data were acquired only for 295 analytes, either due to the non-availability of analytical standards or due other reasons described in this paper. Concerning the apparent recovery, the percentage of 295 analytes matching the acceptable recovery range of 70-120% lied down by SANCO varied from 21% in green pepper to 74% in apple puree at the highest spiking level. At the levels close to limit of quantification only 20-58% of the analytes fulfilled this criterion. The extent of matrix effects was strongly dependent on the analyte/matrix combination. In general, the lowest matrix effects were observed in apple puree (59% of analytes were not influenced by enhancement/suppression at all at the highest validation level). The highest matrix effects were observed in green pepper, where only 10% of analytes did not suffer from signal suppression/enhancement. The repeatability of the method was acceptable (RSD≤20) for 97% of all analytes in apple puree and hazelnuts, for 95% in maize and for 89% in green pepper. Concerning the trueness of the method, Z-scores were generally between -2 and 2, despite a broad variety of different matrices.

To assess the exposure of Danish cattle to mycotoxins from maize silage, 99 samples of whole-crop maize (ensiled and un-ensiled) were analyzed for their contents of 27 mycotoxins and other secondary fungal metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method specifically targets the majority of common pre- and post-harvest fungi associated with maize silage in Denmark.

None of the samples contained mycotoxins above the EU recommended maximum concentrations for Fusarium toxins in cereal-based roughage. Thus, the present study does not indicate that Danish maize silage in general is a cause of acute single mycotoxin intoxications in cattle. However, 31 of the samples contained multiple analytes; two samples as much as seven different fungal metabolites.

LPS-binding protein (LBP) and antibodies (IgG1, IgG2, IgA, and IgM) against fungi were determined in blood using ELISA. Different populations of Lichtheimia corymbifera, Lichtheimia ramosa, Mucor, and Rhizopus were detected. L. corymbifera and L. ramosa were significantly more abundant in animals containing high glyphosate (>40 ng/ml) concentrations in urine. There were no significant changes in IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies toward isolated fungi that were related to glyphosate concentration in urine; however, IgA antibodies against L. corymbifera and L. ramosa were significantly lower in the higher glyphosate groups. Moreover, a negative correlation between IgM antibodies against L. corymbifera, L. ramosa, and Rhizopus relative to glyphosate concentration in urine was observed. LBP also was significantly decreased in animals with higher concentrations of glyphosate in their urine. In conclusion, glyphosate appears to modulate the fungal community.

The effective co-extraction of the mycotoxins under investigation was achieved in 4min by a double extraction approach, using water followed by methanol. Clean up of the extract was performed by a new multi-toxin immunoaffinity column. Analytical performance characteristics were evaluated through single laboratory validation. Raw wheat and maize, corn flakes and maize snacks were chosen as representative matrices for method validation. The validation assay was carried out at 50, 100 and 150% of EU maximum permitted levels for each mycotoxin. Statistical analysis of the results (ANOVA) provided the within laboratory reproducibility and the error contributions from repeatability, between day effects, and influences from different matrix composition. Recoveries generally higher than 70% were obtained for all tested mycotoxins with relative standard deviation (within laboratory reproducibility) lesser than 37%.

HPLC and ELISA were used to measure fumonisin levels. Results of the methods were highly correlated, but ELISA estimates were higher. Bt hybrids experienced less insect injury, Fusarium ear rot, and fumonisin contamination compared to non-Bt hybrids. WBC infestation increased fumonisin content compared to natural infestation in non-Bt and hybrids expressing Cry1Ab protein in five of eight possible comparisons; in Cry1F hybrids, WBC did not impact fumonisins. These results indicate that WBC is capable of increasing fumonisin levels in maize. Under WBC infestation, Cry1F mitigated this risk more consistently than Cry1Ab or non-Bt hybrids. Transgenically expressed Bt proteins active against multiple lepidopteran pests can provide broad, consistent reductions in the risk of fumonisin contamination.

24906357,"Turnout gear provides protection against dermal exposure to contaminants during firefighting; however, the level of protection is unknown. We explored the dermal contribution to the systemic dose of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other aromatic hydrocarbons in firefighters during suppression and overhaul of controlled structure burns. The study was organized into two rounds, three controlled burns per round, and five firefighters per burn. The firefighters wore new or laundered turnout gear tested before each burn to ensure lack of PAH contamination. To ensure that any increase in systemic PAH levels after the burn was the result of dermal rather than inhalation exposure, the firefighters did not remove their self-contained breathing apparatus until overhaul was completed and they were >30 m upwind from the burn structure. Specimens were collected before and at intervals after the burn for biomarker analysis. Urine was analyzed for phenanthrene equivalents using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a benzene metabolite (s-phenylmercapturic acid) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; both were adjusted by creatinine. Exhaled breath collected on thermal desorption tubes was analyzed for PAHs and other aromatic hydrocarbons using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We collected personal air samples during the burn and skin wipe samples (corn oil medium) on several body sites before and after the burn. The air and wipe samples were analyzed for PAHs using a liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. We explored possible changes in external exposures or biomarkers over time and the relationships between these variables using non-parametric sign tests and Spearman tests, respectively. We found significantly elevated (P < 0.05) post-exposure breath concentrations of benzene compared with pre-exposure concentrations for both rounds. We also found significantly elevated post-exposure levels of PAHs on the neck compared with pre-exposure levels for round 1. We found statistically significant positive correlations between external exposures (i.e. personal air concentrations of PAHs) and biomarkers (i.e. change in urinary PAH metabolite levels in round 1 and change in breath concentrations of benzene in round 2). The results suggest that firefighters wearing full protective ensembles absorbed combustion products into their bodies. The PAHs most likely entered firefighters' bodies through their skin, with the neck being the primary site of exposure and absorption due to the lower level of dermal protection afforded by hoods. Aromatic hydrocarbons could have been absorbed dermally during firefighting or inhaled during the doffing of gear that was off-gassing contaminants.

This work sought to quantify the GHG production and consumption at seven depths (0-30, 30-60, 60-90, 90-150, 150-200, 200-250 and 250-300 cm) in a long-term field experiment with a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system, and four N application rates (0; 200; 400 and 600 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) in the North China Plain. The gas samples were taken twice a week and analyzed by gas chromatography. GHG production and consumption in soil layers were inferred using Fick's law. Results showed nitrogen application significantly increased N2O fluxes in soil down to 90 cm but did not affect CH4 and CO2 fluxes. Soil moisture played an important role in soil profile GHG fluxes; both CH4 consumption and CO2 fluxes in and from soil tended to decrease with increasing soil water filled pore space (WFPS). The top 0-60 cm of soil was a sink of atmospheric CH4, and a source of both CO2 and N2O, more than 90% of the annual cumulative GHG fluxes originated at depths shallower than 90 cm; the subsoil (>90 cm) was not a major source or sink of GHG, rather it acted as a 'reservoir'.

Surface areas and pore volumes of the biochars were inversely correlated to the lignin content of raw biomass. The biochars derived from crop straws displayed more developed pore structure than wood char due to the higher lignin content of wood. Sorption capacity of the biochars to Cd(II) followed the order of corn straw>cotton straw>wheat straw>rice straw>poplar shaving, which was not strictly consistent with the surface area of the chars. The surface characteristics of chars before and after Cd(II) sorption were investigated with scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, which suggested that the higher sorption of Cd(II) on corn straw chars was mainly attributed to cation exchange, surface precipitation of carbonate, and surface complexation with oxygen-containing groups.

Proteins are hydrolyzed by 6M HCl (110°C for 24h), 4.2M NaOH (105°C for 20 h), or proteases. Analytical techniques that require high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) include pre-column derivatization with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan, 9-fluorenyl methylchloroformate, phenylisothiocyanate, naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde, 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate, and o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA). OPA reacts with primary AA (except cysteine or cystine) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol or 3-mercaptopropionic acid to form a highly fluorescent adduct. OPA also reacts with 4-amino-1-butanol and 4-aminobutane-1,3-diol produced from oxidation of proline and 4-hydroxyproline, respectively, in the presence of chloramine-T plus sodium borohydride at 60°C, or with S-carboxymethyl-cysteine formed from cysteine and iodoacetic acid at 25°C. Fluorescence of OPA derivatives is monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 455 nm, respectively. Detection limits are 50 fmol for AA. This technique offers the following advantages: simple procedures for preparation of samples, reagents, and mobile-phase solutions; rapid pre-column formation of OPA-AA derivatives and their efficient separation at room temperature (e.g., 20-25°C); high sensitivity of detection; easy automation on the HPLC apparatus; few interfering side reactions; a stable chromatography baseline for accurate integration of peak areas; and rapid regeneration of guard and analytical columns. Thus, the OPA method provides a useful tool to determine AA composition in proteins of animal tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle, liver, intestine, placenta, brain, and body homogenates) and foods (e.g., milk, corn grain, meat, and soybean meal).","Journal of chromatography.

The sample homogenate is subjected to clean-up using SPE, followed by analyte derivatization and ELISA detection. Accuracy, precision and linearity of the ELISA procedure have been validated using spiked samples. Analytical recovery ranged from 91.8% to 96.0% with coefficients of variation below 15%. Good linearity over a wide range of dilution and minimal assay drift was observed within a microtiter plate. IC50 value of the calibration curve was 110 ng/mL, with the limit of detection about 5 ng/mL and dynamic range from 10 to 1000 ng/mL. The high specificity of the ELISA was demonstrated by cross-reactivity study using 11 potential cross-reactants. A good correlation between the results obtained from the ELISA and GC-MS within the concentration range 120-1500 μg/kg was found in the chip samples (r=0.992, n=120).

24723378,"A method for the simultaneous analysis of 14 mycotoxins with the minimization of carryover was developed. Our verification experiments suggested that the carryover occurred due to the chelation of fumonisins with the metal. To wash the fumonisins from the metal, the inner surface of the injection needle was rinsed with 10 mM trisodium citrate and 1% formic acid in water/methanol/acetonitrile/isopropanol after each injection, and the analysis was performed on a metal-free Mastro C18 column. This approach remarkably minimized the carryover of fumonisins. Fourteen mycotoxins in samples were extracted with 2% acetic acid in water/acetonitrile and a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction kit, purified on a MultiSep 229 Ochra, and then quantified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Determinations performed using this method produced a linearity greater than 0.99 and recoveries ranging from 72.6 to 117.4%, with good intraday precision from 4.0 to 12.4%, and interday precision from 6.5 to 17.0%. The limits of detection ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 μg/kg, demonstrating that a highly sensitive method for the simultaneous analysis of mycotoxins over a wide range of concentrations was achieved with minimal carryover.

Isotope values were acquired using guard hair samples from bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in the Adirondack Park, NY, USA. Enrichment along the δ(13)C axis was expected to reflect the use of human sources of food (reflecting a corn subsidy), and by extension tolerance for human-modified environments, whereas enrichment along the δ(15)N axis was expected to reflect a higher level of carnivory (i.e. amount of animal-based protein in the diet) - two mechanisms by which these now sympatric species may achieve a dynamic coexistence. Although bobcats were the only obligate carnivore, all four species shared a similar δ(15)N space. In contrast, bobcat had a lower and distinct δ(13)C signature compared to foxes, consistent with the a priori expectation of bobcats being the species least tolerant of human activities. Isotope signatures for coyotes, which colonized the region in the 1920s, overlapped all three native carnivores, bobcats the least, gray fox the most, indicating their potential competitive influence on this suite of native carnivores.

The concentration of deoxynivalenol was, however, below the MAL with occurrence levels of 100 and 10% for its masked metabolite, deoxynivalenol glucoside. The bacterial metabolites had low concentrations and were not a source of concern. The storage structures significantly correlated positively or negatively (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05), respectively with the levels of grain contamination.

24631210,"National surveys of United States households and child care centers have demonstrated that pyrethroids are widely distributed in indoor habited dwellings and this suggests that co-exposure to multiple pyrethroids occurs in nonoccupational settings. The purpose of this research was to use an environmentally relevant mixture of pyrethroids to assess their cumulative effect on motor activity and develop kinetic profiles for these pyrethroids and their hydrolytic metabolites in brain and blood of rats. Rats were dosed orally at one of two levels (1.5× or 5.0× the calculated dose that decreases rat motor activity by 30%) with a mixture of cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, cis-/trans-permethrin, and β-cyfluthrin in corn oil. At 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24h after dosing, the motor activity of each animal was assessed and the animals sacrificed. Concentrations of pyrethroids in brain and blood, and the following metabolites: cis-/trans-dichlorovinyl-dimethylcyclopropane-carboxylic acid, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid, and cis-dibromovinyl-dimethylcyclopropane-carboxylic acid were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Using this pyrethroid mixture in rats, the results suggest there is greater metabolism of trans-permethrin prior to entering the systemic circulatory system. All pyrethroids had tissue half-lives (t1/2) of less than 5h, excepting esfenvalerate in brain. At early time points, relative pyrethroid brain concentrations approximated their dose mixture proportions and a sigmoidal Emax model described the relationship between motor activity decrease and total pyrethroid brain concentration. In blood, the t1/2's of the cyclopropane metabolites were longer than the phenoxybenzoic metabolites. However, relative to their respective precursors, concentrations of the phenoxybenzoic acids were much higher than concentrations of the cyclopropane metabolites. Brain concentrations of all metabolites were low relative to blood concentrations.

The aim of this research was to evaluate changes in protein solubility of extruded nixtamalized corn flour with and without different concentrations of xylanase enzyme (0.05, 0.075, and 0.1%, w/w). Soluble proteins of each corn flour were extracted and analyzed by SE-HPLC, while insoluble proteins were determined by the combustion method. In addition, each corn flour was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the extruded nixtamalized corn flour, with and without xylanase, increased the protein solubility, and this effect was lower in extruded nixtamalized corn flour with xylanase.

24547694,"Anthocyanins are important dietary components with diverse positive functions in human health. This study investigates effects of accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) on anthocyanin composition and extraction efficiency from blue wheat, purple corn, and black rice in comparison with the commonly used solvent extraction (CSE). Factorial experimental design was employed to study effects of ASE and MAE variables, and anthocyanin extracts were analyzed by spectrophotometry, high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (DAD), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry chromatography. The extraction efficiency of ASE and MAE was comparable with CSE at the optimal conditions. The greatest extraction by ASE was achieved at 50 °C, 2500 psi, 10 min using 5 cycles, and 100% flush. For MAE, a combination of 70 °C, 300 W, and 10 min in MAE was the most effective in extracting anthocyanins from blue wheat and purple corn compared with 50 °C, 1200 W, and 20 min for black rice. The anthocyanin composition of grain extracts was influenced by the extraction method. The ASE extraction method seems to be more appropriate in extracting anthocyanins from the colored grains as being comparable with the CSE method based on changes in anthocyanin composition. The method caused lower structural changes in anthocaynins compared with the MAE method. Changes in blue wheat anthocyanins were lower in comparison with purple corn or black rice perhaps due to the absence of acylated anthocyanin compounds in blue wheat. The results show significant differences in anthocyanins among the 3 extraction methods, which indicate a need to standardize a method for valid comparisons among studies and for quality assurance purposes.

In the present work, the effect of various nitrogen sources, such as monosodium glutamate (MSG), cornmeal, (NH4)₂SO₄, and NaNO₃, on Monascus fermentation was examined under different initial pH conditions. The composition of Monascus pigments and the final pH of fermentation broth after Monascus fermentation were determined. It was found that nitrogen source was directly related to the final pH and the final pH regulated the composition of Monascus pigments and the biosynthesis of citrinin. Thus, an ideal nitrogen source can be selected to control the final pH and then the citrinin biosynthesis. Citrinin-free orange pigments were produced at extremely low initial pH in the medium with (NH4)₂SO₄ or MSG as nitrogen source.

The affinity ligands were structural fragments of polysulfonate triazine dye Cibacron Blue 3GA (CB3GA) and represent novel lead scaffolds for designing synthetic affinity ligands. Solid phase chemistry was used to synthesize variants of CB3GA lead ligand. One immobilized ligand, bearing 4-aminobenzyl sulfonic acid (4ABS) linked on two chlorine atoms of the triazine ring (4ABS-Trz-4ABS), displayed high affinity for mAb 2G12. Absorption equilibrium, 3D molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulation studies were carried out to provide a detailed picture of the 4ABS-Trz-4ABS interaction with mAb 2G12. This biomimetic affinity ligand was exploited for the development of a facile two-step purification protocol for mAb 2G12. In the first step of the procedure, mAb 2G12 was purified on an S-Sepharose FF cation exchanger, and in the second step, mAb 2G12 was purified using affinity chromatography on 4ABS-Trz-4ABS affinity adsorbent.

Validated methods with a low limit of detection (LOD) are required to analyse these kinds of food. An analytical method for the determination of iAs, methylarsonic acid (MA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in cereal-based food and infant cereals is reported. The method was optimised and validated to achieve low LODs. Ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IC-ICPMS) was used for arsenic speciation. The main quality parameters were established. To expand the applicability of the method, different cereal products were analysed: bread, biscuits, breakfast cereals, wheat flour, corn snacks, pasta and infant cereals. The total and inorganic arsenic content of 29 cereal-based food samples ranged between 3.7-35.6 and 3.1-26.0 μg As kg(-1), respectively.

Commercially available test kits (two types of immunochromatographic kits and three types of ELISA kits) were used to assay three types of corn processing by-products and mixed feed. The results obtained with some kits were significantly different from those of LC-MS analysis. Since the differences might be caused by insufficient extraction of DON from samples, the extraction time of all kits was set to be 20 minutes, based on a study of the dependence of the amount of DON extracted on the shaking time. Moreover, the extract of corn processing by-products was acidic, resulting in inhibition of the antigen-antibody reaction, so neutralization and centrifugation processes were introduced to prevent denaturation of antibody. After these modifications, the recovery for all kits in assays of corn gluten meal was within the range of 80-120%, and all kits showed acceptable accuracy. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of repeatability tests for all kits was less than 11.3% for analyses of both corn processing by-products and mixed feeds, indicating good precision.

Each sample (n = 21) was analyzed for AA, DM, CP, crude fiber, crude fat, ash, NDF, ADF, trace minerals, and starch. Mean values (DM basis) were 0.88% Lys, 10.49% crude fat, 34.21% CP, and 4,722 kcal/kg GE. The standard deviations among sorghum DDGS plants were similar to those within plants for most nutrients. Results of these analyses were used to formulate diets for 2 nursery trials. The 2 experiments were conducted to determine the effects of adding sorghum DDGS (29.0% CP and 7.2% crude fat) to corn- or sorghum-based diets on nursery pig growth performance. In Exp. 1, 360 nursery barrows (6.8 kg and 26 d of age) were used in a 34-d study. Pigs were allotted to 1 of 8 dietary treatments with 5 pigs per pen and 9 pens per treatment. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 4 factorial with main effects of grain source (corn vs. sorghum) and sorghum DDGS (0, 15, 30, or 45%). Diets were formulated to 1.30 and 1.25% standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys in phases 1 and 2, respectively, but were not balanced for energy. Overall, there were no differences among pigs fed sorghum- or corn-based diets for ADG and ADFI; however, as sorghum DDGS increased from 0 to 45% of the diet, ADG decreased (linear, P < 0.01). There was a DDGS × grain source interaction (linear, P < 0.04) observed for G:F. In corn-based diets, pigs fed increasing sorghum DDGS had relatively similar G:F. However, in pigs fed sorghum-based diets, G:F was best for those fed 0% DDGS but was decreased in pigs fed 15, 30, or 45% sorghum DDGS. In Exp. 2, 180 nursery pigs (10.7 kg and 38 d of age) were used in a 21-d study with 6 pigs per pen and 5 pens per treatment. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial with main effects of grain source (corn vs. sorghum) and DDGS (0 vs. 30% corn or sorghum DDGS). Diets were formulated to 1.27% SID Lys and were not balanced for energy. Overall, there were no differences in ADG among pigs fed sorghum- or corn-based diets as well as no differences among pigs fed sorghum or corn DDGS.

Understanding the initiation and regulation of its expansion growth is essential for addressing the need for more food and fuel. We used mass spectrometry to identify proteins from auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA)-induced rapidly growing corn (Zea mays) coleoptiles to find possible candidates controlling this growth as well as the underlying cell wall and cuticle biosynthesis. Excised sections were incubated for 4 h in the absence or presence of IAA, protein extracted, and analyzed using LC-ESI-MS/MS. Of 86 proteins identified, 15 showed a predicted association with cell wall/cuticle biosynthesis or trafficking machinery; four identifications revealed novel proteins of unknown function. In parallel, real-time PCR indicated that the steady-state mRNA levels of genes with a known or predicted role in cell-wall biosynthesis increase upon treatment with auxin. Importantly, genes encoding two of the hypothetical proteins also show higher levels of mRNA; additionally, their gene expression is down-regulated as coleoptile growth ceases and up-regulated in expanding leaves. This suggests a major role of those novel proteins in the regulation of processes related to cell and organ expansion and thus plant growth.

The presence of phthalates, the major group of plasticizers, in edible items has gained increasingly more concern due to their endocrine disrupting property. In this study, 15 plasticizers in 21 edible vegetable oils purchased from a U.S. retail market were analyzed using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) were detected in all oil samples. Benzylbutyl phthalate (BzBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were detected at a rate of 95.2, 90.5, and 90.5%, respectively. The detection rates for all other plasticizers ranged from 0 to 57.1%. The content of total plasticizers in oil samples was determined to be 210-7558 μg/kg, which was comparable to the content range in oil marketed in Italy. Although no significant difference (p = 0.05) in the total content of plasticizer was observed among oil species (soybean, canola, corn, and olive), the wider range and higher average of total content of plasticizers in olive oil than other oil species indicated the inconsistence of plasticizer contamination in olive oil and a possible priority for quality monitoring. No significant difference (p = 0.05) in the total content of plasticizers was found among glass-bottle (n = 4), plastic-bottle (n = 14), and metal-can (n = 3) packaging, implying that oil packaging is not the major cause of plasticizer contamination. The daily intake amount of plasticizers contained in edible oil on this U.S. retail market constituted only a minimum percentage of reference dose established by US EPA, thus no obvious toxicological effect might be caused.

This study applied novel urinary multi-mycotoxin LC-MS/MS methods to determine multiple exposure biomarkers in the high oesophageal cancer region, Transkei, South Africa. Fifty-three female participants donated part of their maize-based evening meal and first void morning urine, which was analysed both with sample clean-up (single and multi-biomarker) and by a 'dilute-and-shoot' multi-biomarker method. Results were corrected for recovery with LOD for not detected. A single biomarker method detected fumonisin B1 (FB1) (87% incidence; mean±standard deviation 0.342±0.466 ng/mg creatinine) and deoxynivalenol (100%; mean 20.4±49.4 ng/mg creatinine) after hydrolysis with β-glucuronidase. The multi-biomarker 'dilute-and-shoot' method indicated deoxynivalenol-15-glucuronide was predominantly present. A multi-biomarker method with β-glucuronidase and immunoaffinity clean-up determined zearalenone (100%; 0.529±1.60 ng/mg creatinine), FB1 (96%; 1.52±2.17 ng/mg creatinine), α-zearalenol (92%; 0.614±1.91 ng/mg creatinine), deoxynivalenol (87%; 11.3±27.1 ng/mg creatinine), β-zearalenol (75%; 0.702±2.95 ng/mg creatinine) and ochratoxin A (98%; 0.041±0.086 ng/mg creatinine).

23957423,"In an effort to address the problem of rapid detection of aflatoxin in grain, particularly oilseeds, the current study assessed the spectral differences of aflatoxin production in kernels from a cornfield inoculated with spores from 2 different strains of toxigenic Aspergillus flavus. Aflatoxin production in corn from the same field due to natural infestation was also assessed. A small corn plot in Baton Rouge, La., U.S.A., was used during the 2008-growing season. Two groups of 400 plants were inoculated with 2 different inocula and 1 group of 400 plants was designated as controls. Any contamination detected in the controls was attributed to natural infestation. A subset of each group was imaged with a visible near infra red (VNIR) hyperspectral system under ultra violet (UV) excitation and subsequently analyzed for aflatoxin using affinity column fluorometry. Group differences were statistically analyzed. Results indicate that when all the spectral data across all groups were averaged, any potential differences between groups (treated and untreated) were obscured. However, spectral analysis based on contaminated ""hot"" pixel classification showed a distinct spectral shift/separation between contaminated and clean ears with fluorescence peaks at 501 and 478 nm, respectively. All inoculated and naturally infected control ears had fluorescence peaks at 501 nm that differed from uninfected corn ears. Results from this study may be useful in evaluating rapid, noninvasive instrumentation and/or methodology for aflatoxin detection in grain.

The water activity of all samples collected during the two seasons was <0.70. The total fungal populations of the maize from different regions in the two seasons was not significantly different (p > 0.05). Fusarium verticillioides, F. proliferatum and F. subglutinans predominated in different regions in both seasons based on molecular analyses. In the 2009/10 season, the isolates of these species all produced FB1, while in the 2010/11 season, very few produced FB1. A. flavus isolates (2009/10) were recovered from mountains and Senqu river valley samples while the 2010/11 isolates were predominantly from the foothills and northern lowlands. The mountain isolates of Aspergillus section Flavi produced the highest levels of AFB1 (20 mg kg(-1)). Aspergillus parasiticus was only isolated from the foothills, Senqu river valley and southern lowlands samples, and the AFB1 levels produced ranged from 'none detected' to 3.5 mg kg(-1). The Aspergillus ochraceous isolates were least frequently encountered in both seasons. In the 2009/10 season, the isolates from the northern lowlands produced ochratoxin A (OTA) in culture. No isolates of A. niger from different regions in both seasons produced any OTA. Multi-mycotoxin analyses of the maize samples were done for a range of mycotoxins. At least one sample from each region in both seasons was FB1-positive. FB1 levels for 2010/11 samples (7-936 μg kg(-1)) were higher than in the 2009/10 season (2-3 μg kg(-1)). In both seasons, the mountains registered the highest levels of FB1. Deoxynivalenol (DON) was recovered from all the samples analysed, with the highest mean contamination of 1,469 μg kg(-1) in samples from the northern lowlands. Moniliformin (MON) was detected from all agroecological zones in the two seasons (5-320 μg kg(-1) in 2009/10; 15-1,205 μg kg(-1) in 2010/11). Emerging toxins such as fusaproliferin (FUS) and beauvericin (BEA) were also detected. OTA was not detected in any of the samples analysed.

23929733,"Rapid, precise, and globally comparable methods for monitoring greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes are required for accurate GHG inventories from different cropping systems and management practices. Manual gas sampling followed by gas chromatography (GC) is widely used for measuring GHG fluxes in agricultural fields, but is laborious and time-consuming. The photo-acoustic infrared gas monitoring system (PAS) with on-line gas sampling is an attractive option, although it has not been evaluated for measuring GHG fluxes in cereals in general and rice in particular. We compared N2 O, CO2 , and CH4 fluxes measured by GC and PAS from agricultural fields under the rice-wheat and maize-wheat systems during the wheat (winter), and maize/rice (monsoon) seasons in Haryana, India. All the PAS readings were corrected for baseline drifts over time and PAS-CH4 (PCH4 ) readings in flooded rice were corrected for water vapor interferences. The PCH4 readings in ambient air increased by 2.3 ppm for every 1000 mg cm(-3) increase in water vapor. The daily CO2 , N2 O, and CH4 fluxes measured by GC and PAS from the same chamber were not different in 93-98% of all the measurements made but the PAS exhibited greater precision for estimates of CO2 and N2 O fluxes in wheat and maize, and lower precision for CH4 flux in rice, than GC. The seasonal GC- and PAS-N2 O (PN2 O) fluxes in wheat and maize were not different but the PAS-CO2 (PCO2 ) flux in wheat was 14-39% higher than that of GC. In flooded rice, the seasonal PCH4 and PN2 O fluxes across N levels were higher than those of GC-CH4 and GC-N2 O fluxes by about 2- and 4fold, respectively. The PAS (i) proved to be a suitable alternative to GC for N2 O and CO2 flux measurements in wheat, and (ii) showed potential for obtaining accurate measurements of CH4 fluxes in flooded rice after making correction for changes in humidity.

However, there are limited data on the presence of other mycotoxins. Two multimycotoxin LC-MS/MS methods were applied to good and moldy maize samples, as separated by the farmers themselves from the 2011 harvest. One method involved extract cleanup on multitoxin immunoaffinity columns before LC-MS/MS analysis for aflatoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEN), and T-2 and HT-2 toxins. The other method was based on a ""dilute-and-shoot"" approach for the above mycotoxins and a wide range of other fungal secondary metabolites. Both methods showed high incidences of fumonisins B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2) in good maize (100% for both by the first method, means were 2083 and 927 μg/kg for the two analogues; 93% for both by the second method, positive means of 2764 and 1050 μg/kg, respectively). All samples of moldy maize were contaminated (mean FB1 of 27.64 and 35.98 mg/kg, respectively; mean FB2 of 10.58 and 14.14 mg/kg, respectively). Comparison of the two methods for FB1 and FB2 over the entire range of samples gave R(2) values 0.9144 and 0.8859, respectively. Low levels of DON were found by both methods (positive means of 12 and 4.7 μg/kg in good maize, respectively, and of 14 and 5.8 μg/kg in moldy maize, respectively). ZEN was determined with positive means of 108 and 25 μg/kg in good maize, respectively, and of 111 and 135 μg/kg in moldy maize, respectively. No aflatoxins, OTA, or T-2 or HT-2 toxins were detected.

This effect was enhanced by enzyme-assisted catalytic branching with branching enzyme (BE) or combined BE and β-amylase (BB) catalyzed exo-hydrolysis. Carbons of the glycosidic α-1,6 linkages required high hydration rates before adopting uniform chemical shifts indicating solid-state disorder and poor water accessibility. Comparative analysis of wheat and waxy maize starches demonstrated that starches were similar upon gelatinization independent of botanical origin and that the torsion angles of the glycosidic linkages were averages of the crystalline A and B type structures.

Recently, corn-derived products such as Distiller's Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS), corn gluten feed and corn gluten meal have been introduced and used for mixed feed. However the actual occurrence of trichothecenes has not been sufficiently investigated. So, in this study, we analyzed DON and 6 other trichothecenes, i.e., 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3AcDON), 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15AcDON), T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, nivalenol, and fusarenon-X, in DDGS, corn gluten feed, corn gluten meal, and mixed feed containing corn-derived ingredients. The major trichothecenes identified in the samples tested were DON, 3AcDON and 15AcDON. In particular, DON, 3AcDON and 15AcDON were detected in most DDGS and corn gluten feed samples. Most samples of mixed feed contained DON and 15AcDON, but only one mixed feed sample contained 3AcDON. In contrast, corn gluten meal was contaminated with lower levels of these compounds than the other samples tested.

In this study, the presence of oleoyl-EFB₁ (EFB₁OA) and linoleoyl-EFB₁ (EFB₁LA) in raw maize is reported by means of a suitable LC-ESI-MS/MS method. In addition, the production of EFB₁ derivatives by three Fusarium verticillioides strains is described on malt extract-based media and on corn meal-based growth media. EFB₁OA and EFB₁LA were produced by all considered strains in corn meal medium, with EFB₁LA > EFB₁OA. On the contrary, EFB₁OA and EFB₁LA were never observed in Fusarium cultures grown on a malt extract medium, suggesting that the esterification of FB₁ can occur only in a complex matrix such as maize.","Food additives & contaminants.

AFB1 and the fungi that produce it can also contaminate the raw materials used for beer and wine manufacture, such as corn and grapes. Therefore, brewers must ensure strict monitoring to reduce the risk of contamination. In this study, the fate of AFB1 during the fermentation process was investigated using laboratory-scale bottom and top beer fermentation and wine fermentation. During fermentation, cool wort beer samples and wine must samples were artificially spiked with AFB1 and the levels of AFB1 remaining after fermentation were analyzed. AFB1 levels were unchanged during both types of fermentation used for beer but were reduced to 30% of their initial concentration in wine. Differential analysis of the spiked and unspiked wine samples showed that the degradation compound was AFB2a, a hydrated derivative of AFB1. Thus, the results showed that the risk of AFB1 carryover was still present for both types of beer fermentation but was reduced in the case of wine fermentation because of hydration.

A multi-component immunochromatographic assay (ICA) was developed for rapid and simultaneous determination of these three mycotoxins in agro-food. The strategy was performed based on the competitive immunoreactions between antibody-colloidal gold nanoparticle conjugate probes and mycotoxins or mycotixin antigens. Each monoclonal antibody specially recognize its corresponding mycotoxin and antigen, and there was no cross reactivity in the assay. Three mycotixin antigens were immobilized as three test lines in the nitrocellulose membrane reaction zone, which enable the simultaneous detection in one single test. The visible ICA results were obtained in 20 min. The visual detection limits of this strip test for the AFB1, OTA and ZEA were 0.25 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL, respectively. The assay was evaluated using spiked and naturally contaminated peanuts, maize and rice samples. The results were in accordance with those obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

23803568,"Corn tortillas are a staple in the diet among the Mexican population, and are traditionally produced through a process known as nixtamalization. This traditional process involves steeping whole-kernel corn in an alkaline solution overnight and then grinding the corn into dough (masa), which is then baked. While the masa is held before baking, significant microbial change can occur which leads to fermentation and spoilage. The objective of this research was to characterize and identify the microflora of nixtamalized corn masa from six different commercial tortilla mills throughout Guadalajara, Mexico. The identification of samples was conducted using the microbial identification system (MIS), which analyzes cellular fatty acids via gas chromatography to identify bacterial species. Lactic acid bacteria and aerobic mesophiles were the predominant organisms, with both groups having counts ranging from 10(4) to 10(7)cfu/g across all mills. Coliform populations were observed at counts of 10(2) to 10(3)cfu/g, while yeast and mold counts were typically less than 10(1)cfu/g. Some mills showed no presence of coliforms or yeast or mold. Streptococcus bovis and Lactobacillus oris were isolated from all mills, and were the most prevalent organisms representing 43% and 17% of all lactic acid bacteria isolated, respectively. S. bovis was also isolated on the aerobic tryptic soy plates and was the most prevalent species representing 19% of the total organisms from these aerobic plates.

23744114,"The combined effect of natural antioxidants and packaging materials on the quality decay of breakfast cereals during storage was evaluated. Corn flakes were produced on industrial scale, using different packages and adding natural tocopherols to the ingredients, and stored for 1 year. The samples were then submitted to sensory analysis and HS-solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME/GC/MS) analysis. The packaging had a significant influence on the sensory profile of the aged product: metallized polypropylene gave the highest levels of oxidation compounds and sensory defects. The sensory profile was improved using polypropylene and especially high-density polyethylene. Natural tocopherols reduced the sensory decay of the flakes and the oxidative evolution of the volatile profile. They gave the most remarkable improvement in polypropylene (either metallized or not) packs. Polypropylene showed a barrier effect on the scalping of volatiles outside of the pack. This led to higher levels of oxidation volatiles and faster rates of the further oxidative processes involving the volatiles.

The results were compared with the migration into real packs made of the same packaging material containing six test foods and stored over 9 months. For the direct contact, simulation at 60°C overestimated the maximum migration of the saturated hydrocarbons in the real packs by 73%. Simulation reflected hardly any effect by the plastic films and resulted in an overestimation of the maximum migration into the real packs by a factor of 5.1 and 27 for the polyethylene and the polypropylene film, respectively. Analogous simulation was performed with polenta (corn semolina) instead of Tenax®. Three main causes for this deviation were identified: (i) at 60°C, migration reached beyond n-C₃₅, whereas it ends at about n-C₂₄ in reality. (ii) Tenax® is a far stronger adsorbent than foods, resulting in almost complete extraction.

ENs are produced by several Fusariun strains including Fusarium subglutinans, Fusarium proliferatum and Fusarium tricinctum. Production of a mixture of ENs was performed by culturing F. tricinctum ITEM 9496 on white corn as substrate. The solid culture components were dried and subsequently extracted with water/methanol (50/50 v/v, 0.5% NaCl), homogenised, filtered, extracted by ethyl acetate and analysed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection (LC-DAD). The crude extract was first separated by low pressure liquid chromatography (LPLC) and then further purified by liquid chromatography (LC), resulting in six compounds with a purity higher than 95% as calculated by (1)H NMR, and with a yield of 30-300mg per compound. The chemical structures of the ENs were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The biological activity of the resulting ENs was determined using a mitochondrial respiration test. We discovered that all the ENs studied induced an increase in the mitochondrial respiration resulting in uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation. This effect was most likely due to flux of K(+) ions into the mitochondrial matrix. The order of potency of the ENs derivatives was: A1>B1>B>A>B4>J1.

23675783,"Rice, the staple food of south and east Asian counties, is considered to be hypoallergenic. However, several clinical studies have documented rice-induced allergy in sensitive patients. Rice proteins with molecular weights of 14-16, 26, 33, and 56 kDa have been identified as allergens. Recently, it was documented that the 56 kDa rice allergen was responsible for rice-induced anaphylaxis. The 14-16 kDa allergens have been identified as α-amylase inhibitors; the 26 kDa protein has been identified as α-globulin; and the 33 kDa protein has been identified as glyoxalase I. However, the identity of the 56 kDa rice allergen has not yet been determined. In this study, we demonstrate that serum from patients allergic to maize shows IgE binding to a 56 kDa protein that was present in both maize and rice but not in the oil seeds soybean and peanut. The 56 kDa IgE-binding protein was abundant in the rice endosperm. We have purified this protein from rice endosperm and demonstrated its reactivity to IgE antibodies from the serum of maize-allergic patients. The purified protein was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, resulting in identification of this rice allergen as granule-bound starch synthase, a product of the Waxy gene. Immunoblot analysis using protein extracts from a waxy mutant of rice revealed the absence of the 56 kDa IgE-binding protein. Our results demonstrate that the 56 kDa rice allergen is granule-bound starch synthase and raise the possibility of using waxy mutants of rice as a potential source of the hypoallergenic diet for patients sensitized to the 56 kDa rice allergen.

23614683,"Mycotoxins in foods have long been recognized as potential health hazards due to their toxic and carcinogenic properties. A simple and rapid method was developed to detect 26 mycotoxins (aflatoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins, trichothecenes, and ergot alkaloids) in corn, rice, wheat, almond, peanut, and pistachio products using high-performance liquid chromatography-triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry. Test portions of homogenized grain or nut products were extracted with acetonitrile/water (85:15, v/v), followed by high-speed centrifugation and dilution with water. Mean recoveries (± standard deviations) were 84 ± 6, 89 ± 6, 97 ± 9, 87 ± 12, 104 ± 16, and 92 ± 18% from corn, rice, wheat, almond, peanut, and pistachio products, respectively, and the matrix-dependent instrument quantitation limits ranged from 0.2 to 12.8 μg/kg, depending on the mycotoxin. Matrix effects, as measured by the slope ratios of matrix-matched and solvent-only calibration curves, revealed primarily suppression and were more pronounced in nuts than in grains. The measured mycotoxin concentrations in 11 corn and wheat reference materials were not different from the certified concentrations. Nineteen mycotoxins were identified and measured in 35 of 70 commercial grain and nut products, ranging from 0.3 ± 0.1 μg/kg (aflatoxin B1 in peanuts) to 1143 ± 87 μg/kg (fumonisin B1 in corn flour).

23606126,"Fusarium mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) can occur in cereals conjugated to glucose and probably also to other sugars. These conjugates, which are often referred to as ""masked mycotoxins"", will not be detected with routine analytical techniques. Furthermore, it is suspected that the parent toxin may again be released after hydrolysis in the digestive tracts of animals and humans. Today, our knowledge of the occurrence of these compounds in cereal grains is limited. In this paper, a LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of DON, deoxynivalenol-3-β-D-glucoside (DON-3-glucoside), 3 acetyl-DON, nivalenol, fusarenon-X, diacetoxyscirpenol, HT-2 toxin, and T-2 toxin in naturally (n = 48) and artificially (n = 30) contaminated cereal grains (wheat, barley, oat, rye triticale) is reported. The method has also been applied to whole fresh maize plant intended for production of maize silage (n = 10). The samples were collected from the harvest years 2006-2010, The results show that DON-3-glucoside and DON co-occurred in cereal grains and, especially in several of the highly contaminated samples, the concentration of the glucoside can be relatively high, corresponding to over 37 % of the DON concentration. The DON-3-glucoside levels in both the naturally and in the artificially grain inoculated with Fusarium were second only to DON, and were generally higher than those of the other tested trichothecenes, which were found at low concentrations in most samples, in many cases even below the detection limit of the method. This argues for the importance of taking DON-3-glucoside into account in the ongoing discussion within the European Community concerning exposure re-evaluations for setting changed values for the tolerable intake for DON. Our results indicate that, in the naturally contaminated grains and in the Fusarium infested cereal grains (winter and spring wheat, oat, triticale), the concentration level of DON-3-glucoside is positively correlated to the DON content. When the DON concentration is high, then the content of DON-3-glucoside will most probably also be high and vice versa.",Mycotoxin research,"['D018554', 'D002853', 'D003718', 'D002523', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D005670', 'D005960', 'D001467', 'D013058', 'D012434', 'D014255', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Avena', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Denmark', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fusarium', 'Glucosides', 'Hordeum', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Secale', 'Trichothecenes', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Occurrence of different trichothecenes and deoxynivalenol-3-β-D-glucoside in naturally and artificially contaminated Danish cereal grains and whole maize plants.,"['Q000382', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000032', 'Q000382', 'Q000737']","['microbiology', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', 'microbiology', None, 'microbiology', 'analysis', 'microbiology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23606126,2013

23571334,"A total of 1,280 1-d-old ducks were used in a study to investigate the effects of increasing aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) concentrations from naturally contaminated corn on young ducklings, and the effectiveness of a clay adsorbent (CA) to protect against those effects. Ducks were randomly allotted to 8 treatments (TRT) in a 4 × 2 factorial arrangement with 4 levels of AFB1 (0, 25, 50, and 100 μg/kg) and 2 levels of CA (0 and 0.1%) with 8 pens per TRT and 20 ducks per pen. All ducks were allowed ad libitum access to feed and water during the 21-d experiment. The ADG, ADFI, feed conversion rate, mortality, bill color, and CV of BW of each replicate were measured at the end of the study. Blood and tissue samples from 8 ducks per TRT were obtained on d 21 of the experiment to determine the serum immunoglobulin and protein concentrations, relative organ weights, and intestinal morphology. Average daily gain and relative weights of the liver, spleen, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius decreased linearly (P < 0.05) as dietary AFB1 increased. Serum proteins and intestinal villi heights and villus/crypt ratio followed the same pattern. Bill decolorization ratio, CV of BW, and mortality increased linearly (P < 0.05) as dietary AFB1 increased. Adding 0.1% CA to the diet improved (P < 0.05) the relative weights of the small intestine, spleen, and thymus, and the villus height and villus/crypt ratio of the duodenum and jejunum, as well as the serum IgG and IgM concentrations. Adding CA also reduced (P < 0.05) bill decolorization ratio, CV of BW, mortality, and serum IgA concentration.

First, the stability of chloramphenicol in soil was studied. The fate of chloramphenicol highly depends on soil type and showed a half-life of approximately one day in nonsterile topsoil. It was found to be more stable in subsoil and sterile soils. Second, the production of chloramphenicol in soil was studied, and it was confirmed that Streptomyces venezuelae can produce chloramphenicol at appreciable amounts in nonsterile soil. Third, a transfer study was carried out using wheat and maize grown on three different soils that were weekly exposed to aqueous chloramphenicol solutions at different levels. Chloramphenicol was taken up by crops as determined by chiral liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometric analysis, and the levels in crops were found to be bioavailability related.

Residues of pesticides applied on crops are often found in the food which can cause chronic effect on the health of humans who consume such products. The aim of this study is to measure pesticides residues in maize and cowpea and compare the values with stablished safety limits. A total of 37 pesticides comprising 15 organochlorines, 13 organophosphorus and 9 pyrethroids pesticides were identified in maize and cowpea samples obtained from farms in Ejura. Analytical methods included solvent extraction of the pesticide residues and their subsequent quantification using gas chromatograph equipped with Electron Capture Detector and Pulse Flame Photometric Detector after clean-up on alumina/activated charcoal column. The results showed that the mean concentration of pesticides in maize ranged from 0.001 to 0.103 mg kg(-1) for organochlorine pesticides, 0.002-0.019 mg kg(-1) for organophosphorus pesticides and 0.002-0.028 mg kg(-1) for pyrethroids pesticides. In cowpea the mean concentration ranged from 0.001 to 0.108 mg kg(-1) for organochlorine pesticides, 0.002-0.015 mg kg(-1) for organophosphorus pesticides and 0.001-0.039 mg kg(-1) for pyrethroids pesticides. Maximum Residue Limits for β-HCH, β-endosulfan, p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD were exceeded in both maize and cowpea samples. Health risk estimation revealed that residues of heptachlor, dieldrin, endrin, β-endosulfna, γ-chlordane and chlorfenvinphos found in maize exceeded the Acceptable Daily Intake.

Numerous dogs died on additional farms, but those dogs were not included in the study. The farmers acquired the contaminated maize products, in the form of whole corn grain or as corn meal, from the same supplier. The corn product was mixed with meat that was left over from home or commercial rations to form corn polenta, which was fed to the dogs. Necropsy was performed on 3 dogs. Two of the dogs died after a few days of refusing food, showing anorexia, polydipsia, icteric mucous membranes, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena, and bleeding of the skin, eye, ear, and mouth. The primary necropsy findings included jaundice, hemorrhages in several organs, and yellowish enlarged liver with enhanced lobular pattern. The dog that experienced chronic ascites had a yellowish liver with reduced volume, irregular surface, and increased consistency. The main histological findings included hepatocyte fatty degeneration, biliary duct hyperplasia, cholestasis and, in the chronic case, hepatic fibrosis.

Starch-based sugar syrups, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), glucose syrup (GS) and saccharose syrups (SS), which are produced from beet or canes, can be used for adulterating honey. In this study, adulterated honey samples were prepared with the addition of HFCS, GS and SS (beet sugar) at a ratio of 0%, 10%, 20%, 40% and 50% by weight. (13)C/(12)C analysis was conducted on these adulterated honey samples using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer in combination with an elemental analyser (EA-IRMS). As a result, adulteration using C(4) sugar syrups (HFCS and GS) could be detected to a certain extent while adulteration of honey using C(3) sugar syrups (beet sugar) could not be detected. Adulteration by using SS (beet sugar) still has a serious detection problem, especially in countries in which beet is used in manufacturing sugar.

Citrate and malate, which are present in many foods, also formed Fe(III) complexes but they did not interfere the chromatographic detection of EDTA. The method allowed determination of EDTA in foods at concentrations as low as 0.01 mmol/kg.

To ensure animal health and safe food and feed production, the European Commission has recommended increased monitoring of the co-occurrence of deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, ochratoxin A, fumonisin B(1) and B(2), T-2 and HT-2 toxin in feed. Thus, there is a need for an analytical method that enables their simultaneous detection and quantification. This paper describes the development and in-house validation of such a method, in which the mycotoxins were extracted from spiked and naturally contaminated cereal-based compound feed, corn and wheat. The extracts were divided into two aliquots where one was diluted and then analysed directly and the other was cleaned by using MultiSep(®)226 and then diluted and analysed. Separation and detection was achieved with LC-ESI-MS/MS by using a triple quadrupole instrument in the SRM mode. The precision (in terms of intra-day repeatability and inter-day reproducibility), accuracy, linearity, apparent recovery and expanded measurement uncertainty in feed, corn and wheat were evaluated. The LODs ranged from 1.0 to 72 μg/kg, and the LOQs ranged from 2.5 to 115 μg/kg. The apparent recovery was higher than 86% for all the mycotoxins, and the precision was better than that defined by the Horwitz equation for all concentrations. Proficiency test materials were analysed to assess the accuracy of the method, and the results were satisfactory for all seven mycotoxins. The method will be used to monitor the occurrence of these mycotoxins in products intended for animal feeding in Sweden.","Food additives & contaminants.

23330715,"Starch has unique physicochemical characteristics among food carbohydrates. Starch contributes to the physicochemical attributes of food products made from roots, legumes, cereals, and fruits. It occurs naturally as distinct particles, called granules. Most starch granules are a mixture of 2 sugar polymers: a highly branched polysaccharide named amylopectin and a basically linear polysaccharide named amylose. The starch contained in food products undergoes changes during processing, which causes changes in the starch molecular weight and amylose to amylopectin ratio. The objective of this study was to develop a new, simple, 1-step, and accurate method for simultaneous determination of amylose and amylopectin ratio as well as weight-averaged molecular weights of starch in food products. Starch from bread flour, canned peas, corn flake cereal, snack crackers, canned kidney beans, pasta, potato chips, and white bread was extracted by dissolving in KOH, urea, and precipitation with ethanol. Starch samples were solubilized and analyzed on a high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) system. To verify the identity of the peaks, fractions were collected and soluble starch and beta-glucan assays were performed additional to gas chromatography analysis. We found that all the fractions contain only glucose and soluble starch assay is correlated to the HPSEC fractionation.

Most volatiles decreased in concentration with both increasing HFCS and storage time. Furfural significantly increased in concentration in all adulterated honeys and 1,3-butanediol, acetonitrile, and heptane in some adulterated honeys. During storage, the volatiles that increased were maltol, furfural, 5-methylfurfural, and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural in all honeys and also acetic acid and 1-octen-3-ol levels in some honeys. Soft independent modeling by class analogy (SIMCA) was used to differentiate the volatile profiles of adulterated honeys from fresh and stored honeys.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of ITCs (allyl, benzyl and phenyl) on the stability of FB(1), FB(2) and FB(3). Firstly, PBS solutions at three pH levels (4, 7 and 9) were prepared and added with pairs of one FB (1 mg/L) plus one ITC (1 mg/L). Then, gaseous ITC was used to fumigate corn kernels and corn flour contaminated with FBs produced by Gibberella moniliformis CECT 2987 in situ. Mycotoxin levels were evaluated using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in tandem (LC-MS/MS), while products formed from the reaction of FBs and ITCs were examined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry-linear ion trap (LC-MS-LIT). The reduction of FB(1) and FB(2) in solution ranged from 42 to 100% on a time-dependent manner. This variance was greatly influenced by pH.

23275133,"The analysis of deoxynivalenol (DON) in silage samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) often leads to an overestimation. To better analyze DON in rice and corn silages using a commercially available ELISA kit, a cleanup method using a MultiSep #226 column was developed. As a result, overestimation of DON by the influence of specific cross-reaction with acetyldeoxynivalenol (AcDON) was confirmed. In samples where AcDON was not detected by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), no samples showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in DON amounts between ELISA with cleanup and LC-MS analysis. For the recovery study, blank silage was spiked with 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg DON. The mean recoveries of DON determined by ELISA with cleanup and LC-MS analysis were 112 and 96%, respectively, and the relative standard deviation for the repeatability (RSDr) were 8.2 and 9.8%, respectively. No samples showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in DON concentration determined by either ELISA or LC-MS analysis. A collaborative study to validate this rapid method was carried out using four samples, two rice and two corn silage, by 10 participating laboratories. Each sample was analyzed using blind duplicates. The mean values of DON detected were 1.5-2.3 mg/kg, RSDr and the relative standard deviation for the reproducibility (RSDR) were 4.1-12.7 and 7.6-23.4%, respectively, and the HorRat values were 0.5-1.6. Therefore, the overestimation of DON by the influence of nonspecific cross-reaction with sample matrix was reduced by the cleanup method using a MultiSep #226 column, and analysis of DON in silage was improved.

Bioinformatics analysis of these fractions revealed porphobilinogen deaminase, a DNA-binding protein, and a putative S1 peptidase that increased in abundance with increasing α-amylase activity; with a putative ATP/GTP binding protein decreasing in abundance with increasing pancreatic α-amylase activity. Changes in these fractions may represent adaptations of the pancreas in domestic cattle that are associated with differences in α-amylase activity.","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

23271177,"In this study, we developed a novel tool for purifying two mycotoxins, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and zearalenone (ZEN), in feed. This system utilized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against AFB1 and ZEN, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Among ten MNPs with different diameters and functional groups, a 100-nm diameter MNP (fMA) conjugated to an amine group (-NH(2)) was found to be optimum for coupling with mAbs. The optimal mAb concentrations for coupling to the fMA along with mycotoxin purification capacities of the fMA-mAb conjugates (fMA-AFB1 and fMA-ZEN) were determined. A comparison of mean recovery rates (from corn and product X feed) between the fMA-mAb conjugates and immunoaffinity columns (IAC-AFB1 and IAC-ZEN) showed that the rate for fMA-AFB1 (90~92% and 81~88%) was higher (p > 0.05) than that of IAC-AFB1 (81~84% and 72~78%) for AFB1 (5, 10, 15 ng/mL), and the rate for fMA-ZEN (99~100% and 92~94%) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that of IAC-ZEN (86~88% and 81~88%) for ZEN (10, 25, 50 ng/mL) except at a concentration of 10 ng/mL, demonstrating the remarkable purification efficiency of the novel fMA-mAb method. Additionally, mycotoxin purification was much faster using our novel method (approx. 5 min) than the IAC-based technique (>30 min).

Several factors, such as the pH of derivatization buffer, concentration and flow rate of derivatization reagents, excitation wavelength, emission wavelength, which affected the detection of fumonisins were optimized. The separation was performed on a ZORBAX SB C18 column operated at 40 degrees C with the gradient elution by two mobile phases of 0.1 mol/L sodium dihydrogen phosphate solution (pH 3.3) and methanol at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The derivatization was performed at ambient temperature. The o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The results showed that the optimum conditions were pH 10.5 of the derivatization reagent, OPA concentration at 2 g/L, and excitation wavelength of 335 nm, emission wavelength of 440 nm. The linear plots of FB1 and FB2 were obtained between 0.2 to 20 mg/L, with the correlation coefficients above 0.999 for both FB1 and FB2.

23175982,"A method for the analysis of free and total myo-inositol in foods, feeds, and infant formulas has been developed and validated using high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. The option of a free myo-inositol determination or a complete total myo-inositol determination from main bound sources can be achieved. These sources include phytates, lower'phosphorylated forms, and phosphatidylinositol. This approach gives the option for subtraction of myo-inositol from nonbioavailable sources when it is quantified using other methods if a total bioavailable myo-inositol result is desired for nutritional labeling of a product. The free analysis was validated in a milk-based infant formula, giving RSD(R) of 2.29% and RSD, of 2.06%. A mean recovery of 97.9% was achieved from various spike levels of myo-inositol. Certified National Institute of Standards and Technology reference material verified the method's compatibility and specificity. Two different total analyses were validated in a soy-based infant formula and compared. One technique involved using a conventional acid hydrolysis with autoclave incubation for 6 h, while the other used a novel technique of microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis with enzymatic treatment that can minimize extraction to 1 day. The autoclave analysis had RSD(R) of 2.08% and RSDr of 1.55%, along with a mean spike recovery of 102.1% at various myo-inositol spike levels. The microwave/enzyme total analysis had RSD(R) of 4.34% and RSD, of 4.70%, along with a mean spike recovery of 104.2% at various spike levels of myo-inositol.

Forty-one healthy Beagles, mean age 9.9 years (range 3.1 to 14.8), were fed control or one of two treatment foods for 6 months. All foods were complete and balanced and met the nutrient requirements for adult dogs, and had similar concentrations of moisture, protein, and fat (approx. 7.4%, 14.0%, and 18.1%, respectively). The treatment diets both contained added L-carnitine (300 mg/kg) and 0.6% (treatment food 1) or 1.5% (treatment food 2) added fish oil. Treatment food 2 also had increased MCT from coconut oil, added corn oil, and reduced animal fat. Composition of serum FA was determined by gas chromatography of FA methyl esters. Metabolomic profiles of serum samples were determined from extracted supernatants that were split and run on GC/MS and LC/MS/MS platforms, for identification and relative quantification of small metabolites. Body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Among dog groups, there was no change in total-lean-body weight, or in serum total protein and serum albumin concentrations, based on time or dietary treatment. Serum concentrations of carnitine metabolites were decreased in geriatric (>7 years) vs. mature adult (≤ 7 years) dogs, and supplementation with L-carnitine attenuated the effects of aging. The ratio of PUFA to SFA was significantly greater in mature dogs at baseline (P ≤ 0.05). Serum concentrations of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic FA increased in a dose-dependent manner. Dogs consuming treatment food 2 also had increased serum concentrations of lauric and myristic FA, and decreased concentrations of SFA, MUFA, and arachidonate (all P ≤ 0.05) and their PUFA to SFA ratio increased.

In addition to this, due to its considerable advantages over other techniques, RFGC was used for the characterization of a new biocatalyst, yeast cells immobilized on starch gel, and especially wheat starch gel. Immobilization of wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae AXAZ-1 was accomplished on wheat and corn starch gels in order to prepare new biocatalysts with great interest for the fermentation industry. The RFGC led with great accuracy, resulting from a literature review, to the determination of reaction rate constants and activation energies at each phase of the fermentation processes. A maximum value of rate constants was observed at initial glucose concentration of 205 g/L, where a higher number of yeast cells was observed. The increase of glucose concentrations had a negative influence on the growth of AXAZ-1 cells and rate constants were decreased. The decrease of fermentation temperature caused a substantial reduction in the viability of immobilized cells as well as in rate constant values. Activation energies of corn starch gel presented lower values than those of wheat starch gel.

Fusarin C is a Fusarium mycotoxin, which is mutagenic after metabolic activation. Its occurrence has been demonstrated recently in corn-based samples, but up to now, little is known about the contamination of other grain samples. To collect further data, the quantitation method was enhanced by application of the 21-d3-fusarin C and the use of a QTRAP 5500 mass spectrometer.

22851152,"Aristolochic acids (AAs) are nephrotoxic and carcinogenic derivatives found in several Aristolochia species. To date, the toxicity of AAs has been inferred only from the effects observed in patients suffering from a kidney disease called ""aristolochic acid nephropathy"" (AAN, formerly known as ""Chinese herbs nephropathy""). More recently, the chronic poisoning with Aristolochia seeds has been considered to be the main cause of Balkan endemic nephropathy, another form of chronic renal failure resembling AAN. So far, it was assumed that AAs can enter the human food chain only through ethnobotanical use (intentional or accidental) of herbs containing self-produced AAs. We hypothesized that the roots of some crops growing in fields where Aristolochia species grew over several seasons may take up certain amounts of AAs from the soil, and thus become a secondary source of food poisoning. To verify this possibility, maize plant (Zea mays) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) were used as a model to substantiate the possible significance of naturally occurring AAs' root uptake in food chain contamination. This study showed that the roots of maize plant and cucumber are capable of absorbing AAs from nutrient solution, consequently producing strong peaks on ultraviolet HPLC chromatograms of plant extracts. This uptake resulted in even higher concentrations of AAs in the roots compared to the nutrient solutions. To further validate the measurement of AA content in the root material, we also measured their concentrations in nutrient solutions before and after the plant treatment. Decreased concentrations of both AAI and AAII were found in nutrient solutions after plant growth. During this short-term experiment, there were much lower concentrations of AAs in the leaves than in the roots. The question is whether these plants are capable of transferring significant amounts of AAs from the roots into edible parts of the plant during prolonged experiments.",Environmental geochemistry and health,"['D034341', 'D001449', 'D002851', 'D018553', 'D005517', 'D006801', 'D018517', 'D003313']","['Aristolochic Acids', 'Balkan Nephropathy', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cucumis sativus', 'Foodborne Diseases', 'Humans', 'Plant Roots', 'Zea mays']",Possible health impacts of naturally occurring uptake of aristolochic acids by maize and cucumber roots: links to the etiology of endemic (Balkan) nephropathy.,"['Q000378', 'Q000209', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000150', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","['metabolism', 'etiology', None, 'metabolism', 'complications', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22851152,2013
22829604,"Studies using dietary supplementation of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids (FA) in horses report inconsistent anti-inflammatory results but consistently report an increase in plasma arachidonic acid (C20:4), the major substrate of cyclooxygenase (COX) II inflammatory pathway. Conjugated linoleic acid has shown anti-inflammatory effects in laboratory and food animal species, but effects of CLA supplementation in horses have not been reported. Our objective was to determine the effects of CLA supplementation on plasma CLA and C20:4 and body fat in healthy horses at maintenance. In a crossover study, 12 mature mares were blocked by breed, age, and BCS and separated into 2 treatment groups (n = 6/group). Groups were fed CLA and corn oil (CO; isocaloric control) for two 6-wk feeding periods, separated by a 4-wk period during which treatment was withheld. Corn oil or CLA supplement (55% mixed CLA isomers) was incorporated into diets at 0.01% BW/d. Mares were fed individually and restricted to dry lots to control forage intake. Rump fat thickness (RFT), BW, and BCS were measured before (d 0) and after (d 42) each feeding period. Blood was collected on d 0, 14, 28, and 42 of each 6-wk period for GLC analysis of plasma CLA isomers (cis-9, trans-11; trans-10, cis-12; and trans-9, trans-11) and C20:4. An ANOVA was conducted to compare the response of RFT, BW, and BCS of CLA-treated and control mares. A mixed methods analysis with repeated measures was used to detect differences in plasma FA concentrations. There were no differences in BW, RFT, or BCS between treatment groups. All CLA isomers present in the CLA supplement were greater in plasma of horses fed CLA compared with controls (P < 0.01). Additionally, plasma concentrations of C20:4 were decreased in horses fed CLA (P < 0.05). This decline in C20:4 may impact the COX II pathway and warrants further investigation. These results suggest that in an equine model, dietary CLA increases circulating concentrations of supplemented CLA isomers and decreases circulating C20:4. Examining physiological effects of CLA supplementation in horses at varying levels of growth, exercise, and progression of joint disease may offer insight to potential benefits of CLA in the horse.",Journal of animal science,"['D000273', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D016718', 'D002853', 'D018592', 'D004032', 'D019587', 'D005260', 'D006736', 'D044243']","['Adipose Tissue', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Horses', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated']",Dietary supplementation of conjugated linoleic acid in horses increases plasma conjugated linoleic acid and decreases plasma arachidonic acid but does not alter body fat.,"['Q000378', None, None, 'Q000097', 'Q000662', None, 'Q000662', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000008']","['metabolism', None, None, 'blood', 'veterinary', None, 'veterinary', 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22829604,2013
22793673,"The presence of phenolic acids in cereal grain is thought to influence starch hydrolysis during liquefaction and saccharification of grain flours in the bioethanol industry. As a basis for remodeling starch hydrolysis systems and understanding inhibition mechanisms, the composition and concentration of phenolic acids in whole grain flours of triticale, wheat, barley, and corn were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The total phenolic acid contents (sum of nine phenolic acids) in the four grains were 1.14, 1.70, 0.90, and 1.25 mg/g, respectively, with more than 90% found in the bound form. Ferulic, coumaric, and protocatechuic acids were the major phenolic acids in triticale and wheat. Gallic acid was also rich in triticale. Ferulic, coumaric, hydroxybenzoic, and gallic acids were predominant in barley. In corn, ferulic, coumaric, gallic, and syringic acids were abundant. On the basis of these profiles, pure phenolic acids were added individually and collectively to isolated starches at amounts either equivalent to or 3 times those in the whole grains for hydrolysis. The degree of starch hydrolysis with α-amylase and amyloglucosidase decreased up to 8% when individual phenolic acids were present in cooked starch slurry. The decreases were more pronounced when phenolic acids were added collectively (4-5% with α-amylase and 9-13% with sequential α-amylase and amyloglucosidase). The study of a phenolic acid-starch-enzyme model system indicated that the interactions of phenolic acid-enzyme and phenolic acid-starch significantly contributed to the inhibitory effect of starch hydrolysis. Heating facilitated the interactions. Phenolic acids thus play a significant role in the resistance of starch to enzyme and/or the loss of enzyme activity during starch hydrolysis.

Previously established extraction methods developed by Ross and colleagues, as well as a semiautomated method involving accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), were applied to extract ARs within freshly ground samples. For extraction of alkylresorcinols, nonpolar solvents such as ethyl acetate have been recommended for the extraction of uncooked foods, and polar solvents such as 1-propanol:water (3:1 v/v) have been recommended for the extraction of baked foods that contain rye, wheat, or other starch-rich grains. A comparison of AR extraction methods has been investigated with the application of gas chromatography and a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) to quantify the AR content. The goal of this research was to compare the rapid accelerated solvent extraction of the alkylresorcinols (ASE-AR) method to the previous manual AR extraction methods. Results for this study as well as the investigation of the overall efficiency of ASE-AR extraction with the use of a spiking study indicated that it can be comparable to current extraction methods but with less time required.

22494580,"This study examined the relationship between storage environmental factors (water activity (a(w)) (0.89-0.97) and temperature (15°C-30°C)), colonisation of wheat and maize by Fusarium graminearum and F. verticillioides respectively and the dry matter losses (DMLs) caused and quantified by contamination with deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisins (FUMs) during storage. Fungal growth was assessed by the amount of CO(2) produced under different interacting conditions of a(w) and temperature. DMLs were quantified using the cumulative CO(2) data, and these were shown to increase as temperature and a(w) increased. The amount of DON, ZEA (wheat for human consumption) and FUMs (feed maize) produced was significantly affected by the storage conditions. The three toxins however showed different patterns of production. Optimum for DON was at the wettest conditions (0.97a(w)) and the highest temperature assessed (30°C), whereas for ZEA this shifted to 25°C. FUMs were produced in higher amounts in maize at 30°C and 0.97a(w); however, at intermediate a(w) levels (0.955a(w)), the highest production occurred at 25°C followed by 20°C. Polynomial models were developed for the effect of the storage factors on DMLs and toxin production. DMLs under different environmental conditions were significantly correlated with DON and FUMs. DON contamination was above the EU limits in at least 80% of the wheat samples with DMLs >1%, whereas at least 70% of the same samples contained ZEA above the respective EU legislative limits. Similarly, at least 75% of the maize samples with DMLs ≥ 0.9% exceeded the EU limits for the sum of FUMs in feed. These results show that it may be possible to use temporal CO(2) production during storage of grains as an indicator of the level of contamination of the grain with mycotoxins.","Food additives & contaminants.

22489824,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a toxin produced by certain species of Fusarium fungi that can infest wheat, barley and corn. The fungi cause diseases in crops worldwide and some of the secondary metabolites, such as DON, can adversely affect animal health and food safety. To monitor DON in wheat rapidly, a biosensor using the principle of biolayer interferometry (BLI) was developed. The signal from the sensor was substantially amplified through the use of a primary antibody-colloidal gold conjugate. The amplification was much greater in the presence of wheat matrix than in buffered solution, suggesting matrix components may have contributed to the enhancement. The improved signal provided by the amplification allowed for the development of rapid qualitative and quantitative assays. The limit of detection of the method was 0.09 mg kg(-1); the limit of quantitation was 0.35 mg kg(-1). Recovery from wheat spiked over the range from 0.2 to 5 mg kg(-1) averaged 103% (RSD = 12%). The quantitative assay compared favourably (r(2) = 0.9698) with a reference chromatographic method for 40 naturally contaminated wheats. The qualitative assay was able to classify accurately the same group of 40 samples as either above or below a 0.5 mg kg(-1) threshold. These results suggest that the BLI technique can be used to measure DON in wheat rapidly.","Food additives & contaminants.

No deaths occurred in any groups, and there were no changes from controls in detailed clinical observations, body weights, and food consumption in any treatment groups. Moreover, no treatment-related histopathological changes were found in any organs examined at the end of the administration period and at the end of the recovery period. Blackish feces and black contents of the stomach and large intestine were observed in males and females at 1,000 mg/kg/day in the treatment group. There were no changes from controls in the liver and spleen weights at the end of the administration period, but those weights in males in the 1,000 mg/kg/day group increased at the end of the recovery period. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, fullerene C60 were not detected in the liver, spleen or kidney at the end of the administration period and also at the end of the recovery period. In conclusion, the present study revealed no toxicological effects of fullerene C60; however, the slight increases in liver and spleen weights after the 14-day recovery period may be because of the influence of fullerene C60 oral administration.

In this study, aflatoxin and non-aflatoxin producing isolates of A. flavus were grown separately on wet (20% water added), sterile or non-sterile cracked corn. Wet and dry cracked corn controls were included as needed. Secondary metabolic volatiles were identified and aflatoxin concentrations determined over a 12-day period. Volatiles unique to the toxigenic A. flavus isolates were determined by comparison with volatiles produced by the respective corn controls and the non-toxigenic A. flavus isolate. The number and identity of the volatiles produced by these A. flavus isolates varied by isolate, whether sterile or non-sterile corn was the substrate, and the sampling day. Overall, most of the volatiles were produced before day 8 after inoculation. Aflatoxin production was 10-fold lower on the sterile corn, compared to the non-sterile corn. Volatiles unique to the aflatoxin producing isolates were identified on both substrates after comparison with those produced by the non-aflatoxin producing isolate, as well as the corn control samples.

Corn silage was cultivated on cropland in Lower Saxony in Germany where, as a result of illegal waste disposal in 2006, farmland was contaminated with perfluorinated alkylacids (PFAAs). Two sheep were exposed by way of PFAA-contaminated corn silage to PFOS (1.16 and 1.45 μg/kg body weight [bw]/d, respectively) and PFOA (0.43 and 0.53 μg/kg bw/d) during a period of 21 days. During the PFAA-feeding period, PFOS levels in plasma increased continuously to maximum concentration of 103 and 240 μg/L for sheep 1 and sheep 2, respectively. The PFOA plasma concentration remained low (sheep 1 = 3.3 ± 2.2 μg/L; sheep 2 = 15.6 ± 8.3 μg/L). Data indicate that urinary excretion is the primary clearance route for PFOA (sheep 1 = 51 %; sheep 2 = 55 %), whereas PFOS excretion by way of urine could not be quantified. The highest PFOS excretion (4 to 5 %) was detected in faeces. PFOS was also excreted at higher levels than PFOA by way of milk. During a period of 21 days, a total PFOS transfer into milk ≤ 2 % was calculated. Overall, total excretion of PFOS was significantly lower compared with that of PFOA (PFOS 6 %; PFOA 53 to 56 %). PFOS levels in sheep 1 and sheep 2 were highest in liver (885 and 1,172 μg/kg weight wet [ww], respectively) and lowest in muscle tissue (24.4 and 35.1 μg/kg ww, respectively). PFOA levels in muscle tissue were low for sheep 2 (0.23 μg/kg ww) and not detectable after the PFAA-free feeding period in sheep 1.

22451177,"The effects of feeding bees artificial sugars and/or proteins on the sugar compositions and (13)C isotopic measurements of royal jellies (RJs) were evaluated. The sugars fed to the bees were two C4 sugars (cane sugar and maize hydrolysate), two C3 sugars (sugar beet, cereal starch hydrolysate), and honey. The proteins fed to them were pollen, soybean, and yeast powder proteins. To evaluate the influence of the sugar and/or protein feeding over time, samples were collected during six consecutive harvests. (13)C isotopic ratio measurements of natural RJs gave values of around -25 ‰, which were also seen for RJs obtained when the bees were fed honey or C3 sugars. However, the RJs obtained when the bees were fed cane sugar or corn hydrolysate (regardless of whether they were also fed proteins) gave values of up to -17 ‰. Sugar content analysis revealed that the composition of maltose, maltotriose, sucrose, and erlose varied significantly over time in accordance with the composition of the syrup fed to the bees. When corn and cereal starch hydrolysates were fed to the bees, the maltose and maltotriose contents of the RJs increased up to 5.0 and 1.3 %, respectively, compared to the levels seen in authentic samples (i.e., samples obtained when the bees were fed natural food: honey and pollen) that were inferior to 0.2% and not detected, respectively. The sucrose and erlose contents of natural RJs were around 0.2 %, whereas those in RJs obtained when the bees were fed cane or beet sugar were as much as 4.0 and 1.3 %, respectively.

22382856,"High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a widely used liquid sweetener produced from corn starch by hydrolysis and partial isomerization of glucose to fructose. During these processing steps, sugars can be considerably degraded, leading, for example, to the formation of reactive α-dicarbonyl compounds (α-DCs). The present study performed targeted screening to identify the major α-DCs in HFCS. For this purpose, α-DCs were selectively converted with o-phenylendiamine to the corresponding quinoxaline derivatives, which were analyzed by liquid chromatography with hyphenated diode array-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MS/MS) detection. 3-Deoxy-D-erythro-hexos-2-ulose (3-deoxyglucosone), D-lyxo-hexos-2-ulose (glucosone), 3-deoxy-D-threo-hexos-2-ulose (3-deoxygalactosone), 1-deoxy-D-erythro-hexos-2,3-diulose (1-deoxyglucosone), 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene, methylglyoxal, and glyoxal were identified by enhanced mass spectra as well as MS/MS product ion spectra using the synthesized standards as reference. Addition of diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid and adjustment of the derivatization conditions ensured complete derivatization without de novo formation for all identified α-DCs in HFCS matrix except for glyoxal. Subsequently, a ultra-high performance LC-DAD-MS/MS method was established to quantify 3-deoxyglucosone, glucosone, 3-deoxygalactosone, 1-deoxyglucosone, 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene, and methylglyoxal in HFCS. Depending on the α-DC compound and concentration, the recovery ranged between 89.2% and 105.8% with a relative standard deviation between 1.9% and 6.5%. Subsequently, the α-DC profiles of 14 commercial HFCS samples were recorded. 3-Deoxyglucosone was identified as the major α-DC with concentrations up to 730 μg/mL HFCS. The total α-DC content ranged from 293 μg/mL to 1,130 μg/mL HFCS.

22366282,"A reliable procedure for the identification and quantification of the adulteration of olive oils in terms of blending with other vegetable oils (sunflower, corn, seeds, sesame and soya) has been developed. From the analytical viewpoint, the whole procedure relies only on the results of the determination of the triacylglycerol profile of the oils by high temperature gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The chromatographic profiles were pre-treated (baseline correction, peak alignment using iCoshift algorithm and mean centering) before building the models. At first, a class-modeling approach, Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) was used to identify the vegetable oil used blending. Successively, a separate calibration model for each kind of blending was built using Partial Least Square (PLS). The correlation coefficients of actual versus predicted concentrations resulting from multivariate calibration models were between 0.95 and 0.99. In addition, Genetic algorithms (GA-PLS), were used, as variable selection method, to improve the models which yielded R(2) values higher than 0.90 for calibration set. This model had a better predictive ability than the PLS without feature selection. The results obtained showed the potential of this method and allowed quantification of blends of olive oil in the vegetable oils tested containing at least 10% of olive oil.","Journal of chromatography.

Soils and maize tissues were sampled from 40 farms in Tanzania and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in the United Kingdom. The results showed high levels of PTEs in both soils and maize tissues above the recommended limits. Nickel levels of up to 34.4 and 56.9mgkg(-1) respectively were found in some maize shoots and grains from several districts. Also, high Pb levels >0.2mgkg(-1) were found in some grains. The grains and shoots with high levels of Ni and Pb are unfit for human and animal consumption. Concentrations of individual elements in maize tissues and soils did not correlate and showed differences in uptake and translocation. However, Ni showed a more efficient transfer from soils to shoots than As, Pb and Cr. Transfer of Cr and Ni from shoots to grains was higher than other elements, implying that whatever amount is assimilated in maize shoots is efficiently mobilized and transferred to grains.

22220906,"The aim of this study was to apply an untargeted NMR and LC-MS-based metabolomics approach to detect potential differences between an organically and a conventionally produced feed, which caused statistically significant differences in growth, in the response to an immunological challenge and in the gene expression profiles in the small intestine of laying hens. A fractionation procedure was set up to create multiple fractions of the feed, which were subsequently analysed by NMR and UPLC-TOF/MS operating in positive mode. Comparison of the profiles revealed that the most apparent differences came from the isoflavones in the soy as well as a compound with a molecular mass of 441.202 (M + 1)⁺, which was identified as N,N'-diferuloylputrescine (DFP) and came from the corn. Whether the observed differences in effects are due to the higher levels of isoflavones and DFP is unclear, as is the fact whether the observed differences are typical for organic or conventional produced corn and soy. However, this study shows that this metabolomics approach is suitable for detecting potential differences between products, even in levels of compounds that would have been overlooked with a more targeted approach. As such, the method is suitable for a more systematic study on differences between conventionally and organically produced food.","Food additives & contaminants.

22209956,"The current food crisis demands unambiguous determination of mycotoxin contamination in staple foods to achieve safer food for consumption. This paper describes the first accurate LC-MS/MS method developed to analyze tricothecenes in grains by applying multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transition and MS(3) quantitation strategies in tandem. The tricothecenes are nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside, fusarenon X, 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, diacetoxyscirpenol, and HT-2 and T-2 toxins. Acetic acid and ammonium acetate were used to convert the analytes into their respective acetate adducts and ammonium adducts under negative and positive MS polarity conditions, respectively. The mycotoxins were separated by reversed-phase LC in a 13.5-min run, ionized using electrospray ionization, and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Analyte-specific mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios were used to perform quantitation under MRM transition and MS(3) (linear ion trap) modes. Three experiments were made for each quantitation mode and matrix in batches over 6 days for recovery studies. The matrix effect was investigated at concentration levels of 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 μg kg(-1) (n = 3) in 5 g corn flour and rice flour. Extraction with acetonitrile provided a good overall recovery range of 90-108% (n = 3) at three levels of spiking concentration of 40, 80, and 120 μg kg(-1). A quantitation limit of 2-6 μg kg(-1) was achieved by applying an MRM transition quantitation strategy. Under MS(3) mode, a quantitation limit of 4-10 μg kg(-1) was achieved. Relative standard deviations of 2-10% and 2-11% were reported for MRM transition and MS(3) quantitation, respectively. The successful utilization of MS(3) enabled accurate analyte fragmentation pattern matching and its quantitation, leading to the development of analytical methods in fields that demand both analyte specificity and fragmentation fingerprint-matching capabilities that are unavailable under MRM transition.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002853', 'D002523', 'D005504', 'D013058', 'D014255']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Food Analysis', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Trichothecenes']",Analytical method for the accurate determination of tricothecenes in grains using LC-MS/MS: a comparison between MRM transition and MS3 quantitation.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22209956,2012

We found that corn, two Cynodon spp. (bermudagrass C. dactylon (L.) Persoon, 'NuMex Sahara', and stargrass C. nlemfuensis var. nlemfuensis Vanderyst, 'Florona'), and a hybrid between bermudagrass and stargrass, 'Tifton 85', exhibited differences in the concentration of the cyanogenic precursors or cyanogenic potential (HCNp) and the release of hydrogen cyanide per unit time or cyanogenic capacity (HCNc). Corn plants released low levels of hydrogen cyanide, while stargrass had greater HCNp/HCNc than bermudagrass and 'Tifton 85'. Feeding studies showed that corn strain larvae experienced higher mortality than the rice strain when fed stargrass or artificial diet supplemented with cyanide. Also, corn strain larvae excreted higher levels of cyanogenic compounds than the rice strain when fed Cynodon spp. These differences in excretion suggest potential disparities in cyanide metabolism between the two strains.

22155269,"The objectives of this study were to assess the occurrence of zearalenone (ZEA) in food in Catalonia (Spain); to assess the consumption of the main food items contaminated with ZEA; and finally, to estimate the dietary exposure of the Catalonian population to the mycotoxin. Therefore 1187 samples were collected from the Catalonian market and pooled to obtain 485 analytical samples (composites) of the commodities most susceptible to ZEA contamination and commonly consumed in the region. Extraction and clean-up was performed using immunoaffinity columns and ZEA was detected and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fluorescence detection. A specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was administered to 1264 individuals by trained interviewers to estimate the consumption of the relevant foods. The results showed that the occurrence of ZEA in food marketed in Catalonia was infrequent. Sliced bread, corn snacks and sweet corn were the commodities where it was most often present. In considering the contamination levels and food consumption estimates, the dietary intake of ZEA by the Catalonian population was estimated to be considerably lower than the temporary tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 200 ng ZEA kg(-1) bw day(-1).",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"['D002846', 'D002851', 'D004781', 'D004967', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D009183', 'D013030', 'D013050', 'D015025']","['Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Estrogens', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Mycotoxins', 'Spain', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Zearalenone']","Occurrence of zearalenone, an oestrogenic mycotoxin, in Catalonia (Spain) and exposure assessment.","[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22155269,2012

22098923,"An internal fruit rot disease of sweet peppers was first detected in Belgium in 2003. Research conducted mostly in Canada indicates that this disease is primarily caused by Fusarium lactis Pirotta. Ninety-eight Fusarium isolates obtained from diseased sweet peppers from Belgium, as well as from other countries (Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) were identified by sequencing the translation elongation factor 1α (EF). Of these 98 isolates, 13 were identified as F. oxysporum Schltdl., nine as F. proliferatum (Matsush.) Nirenberg and two belonged to clade 3 of the F. solani species complex. Of the 74 remaining isolates, the EF sequence showed 97% to 98% similarity to F. lactis. Of these isolates, the β-tubulin (TUB), calmodulin (CAM) and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) genes were also sequenced. Analysis of the combined sequences revealed that the 74 isolates share nine combined sequences that correspond to nine multilocus sequence types (STs), while the F. lactis neotype strain and one other strain, both isolated from figs, form a separate ST. Together, these 10 STs represent a monophyletic F. lactis species complex (FLASC). An unusually high level of genetic diversity was observed between (groups of) these STs. Two of them (ST5 and ST6) fulfilled the criteria for species recognition based on genealogical exclusivity and together represent a new monophyletic species lineage (FLASC-1). The seven other STs, together with the F. lactis neotype ST, form a paraphyletic species lineage in the African clade of the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (GFSC). From each of the 10 STs, the mycotoxin production was assessed using a multi-mycotoxin liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. Out of the 27 analyzed mycotoxins, beauvericin and fumonisins were detected in sweet pepper tissue and in maize kernels. The 10 STs clearly differed in the amount of mycotoxin produced, but there was only limited congruence between the production profile and the phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, the morphological characterization (based on mycelial growth rate and the length of macroconidia) showed distinct differences between the 10 STs, but again there was limited congruence with the phylogenetic results. In conclusion, the data presented in this study demonstrate that 75% of the isolates obtained from sweet pepper with internal fruit rot belong to a F. lactis species complex (FLASC), including a new FLASC-1 monophyletic species, and that the members of this complex display great genetic and phenotypic diversity.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D001530', 'D002147', 'D002170', 'D002212', 'D005670', 'D014644', 'D008969', 'D058885', 'D009183', 'D009426', 'D020648', 'D012319', 'D014404', 'D006113', 'D003313']","['Belgium', 'Calmodulin', 'Canada', 'Capsicum', 'Fusarium', 'Genetic Variation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multilocus Sequence Typing', 'Mycotoxins', 'Netherlands', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Tubulin', 'United Kingdom', 'Zea mays']",Genetic diversity and mycotoxin production of Fusarium lactis species complex isolates from sweet pepper.,"[None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235']","[None, 'genetics', None, 'microbiology', 'genetics', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22098923,2012

Numerous investigations have focused on grain maize, but little is known about the Fusarium species in the entire plant used for silage. Furthermore, mycotoxins persist during the ensiling process and thus endanger feed safety. In the current study, we analyzed 20 Swiss silage maize samples from growers' fields for the incidence of Fusarium species and mycotoxins. The species spectrum was analyzed morphologically and mycotoxins were measured by LC-MS/MS. A pre-harvest visual disease rating showed few disease symptoms. In contrast, the infection rate of two-thirds of the harvest samples ranged from 25 to 75% and twelve different Fusarium species were isolated. The prevailing species were F. sporotrichioides, F. verticillioides and F. graminearum. No infection specificity for certain plant parts was observed. The trichothecene deoxynivalenol (DON) was found in each sample (ranging from 780 to 2990 µg kg(-1)). Other toxins detected in descending order were zearalenone, further trichothecenes (nivalenol, HT-2 and T-2 toxin, acetylated DON) and fumonisins.

Several studies have suggested that protein associated with CFG could be partly responsible for its excellent emulsifying properties in oil-in-water emulsion systems. Nevertheless, the composition and identity of the protein component has never been determined. In the present study, CFG was deglycosylated by treating with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, and the resulting proteins were purified by passage through C18 solid phase extraction cartridges. The proteins were then separated and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein band from the gel was treated with a proteolytic enzyme, chymotrypsin, and the resulting peptides were cleaned using C18 Zip Tip pipet tips and analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with automated tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The partial sequences derived from the mass spectrometry analyses of the resulting chymotryptic peptides were found to be similar to the 22-kDa alpha-zein Z1 (az22z1) protein (a major storage protein in corn endosperm) when queried against the primary sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database.

22023855,"The interference standard method (IFS) is evaluated to improve the accuracy of the determination of S, Mn and Fe in meat and grain samples by inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS). Due to ICP-QMS relatively low resolution, polyatomic interferences caused by (16)O(2)(+), ((16)OH)(2)(+), (40)Ar(14)NH(+), and (40)Ar(16)O(+), for example, can compromise determinations at m/z 32, 34, 55, and 56, respectively. In IFS, differently from traditional internal standard methods, plasma naturally occurring species are used to correct for variations in the interference signal rather than the analyte signal. The method is based on the hypothesis that the interfering ion and the IFS probe present similar behaviors in the plasma, and that by using the analytical (analyte plus interference)/IFS signal ratio one could reduce variations due to interference and, consequently, improve accuracy. In this work, this strategy is evaluated in real sample applications and significant improvements on accuracy are observed for (32)S, (34)S, (55)Mn, and (56)Fe determinations. Recoveries ranging from 72% for Mn to 105% for Fe in two different standard reference materials are obtained using the (38)Ar probe.

The total fumonisin concentration was 0.28-1.1 mg kg(-1) for good-quality batches and 0.03-6.2 mg kg(-1) for mouldy-quality batches. The high fumonisin content in the batches was apparently caused by a small number (4%) of highly contaminated kernels, and removal of these reduced the average fumonisin content by 71%.

Variability of response, as measured in % relative standard deviation of peak areas over seven replicate fortified sample analyses, was found to differ among the classes of analytes, ranging from <10% to >100%.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine molecular structural changes of lipid related functional groups in the co-products that occurred during bioethanol processing; (2) relatively quantify the antisymmetric CH(3) and CH(2) (ca. 2959 and 2928 cm(-1), respectively), symmetric CH(3) and CH(2) (ca. 2871 and 2954 cm(-1), respectively) functional groups, carbonyl C=O ester (ca. 1745 cm(-1)) and unsaturated groups (CH attached to C=C) (ca. 3007 cm(-1)) spectral intensities as well as their ratios of antisymmetric CH(3) to antisymmetric CH(2), and (3) illustrate the molecular spectral analyses as a research tool to detect for the sensitivity of individual moleculars to the bioethanol processing in a complex plant-based feed and food system without spectral parameterization. The hypothesis of this study was that bioethanol processing changed the molecular structure profiles in the co-products as opposed to original cereal grains. These changes could be detected by infrared molecular spectroscopy and will be related to nutrient utilization. The results showed that bioethanol processing had effects on the functional groups spectral profiles in the co-products. It was found that the CH(3)-antisymmetric to CH(2)-antisymmetric stretching intensity ratio was changed. The spectral features of carbonyl C=O ester group and unsaturated group were also different. Since the different types of cereal grains (wheat vs. corn) had different sensitivity to the bioethanol processing, the spectral patterns and band component profiles differed between their co-products (wheat DDGS vs. corn DDGS). The multivariate molecular spectral analyses, cluster analysis and principal component analysis of original spectra (without spectral parameterization), distinguished the structural differences between the wheat and wheat DDGS and between the corn and corn DDGS in the antisymmetric and symmetric CH(3) and CH(2) spectral region (ca. 2994-2800 cm(-1)) and unsaturated group band region (3025-2996 cm(-1)).

The P. ruminicola 23 genome contains 16 genes predicted to encode carbohydrate esterase activity, and based on microarray data, four of these were upregulated >2-fold at the transcriptional level during growth on an ester-enriched oligosaccharide (XOS(FA,Ac)) from corn relative to a nonesterified fraction of corn oligosaccharides (AXOS). Four of the 16 esterases (Xyn10D-Fae1A, Axe1-6A, AxeA1, and Axe7A), including the two most highly induced esterases (Xyn10D-Fae1A and Axe1-6A), were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and biochemically characterized. All four enzymes showed the highest activity at physiologically relevant pH (6 to 7) and temperature (30 to 40°C) ranges. The P. ruminicola 23 Xyn10D-Fae1A (a carbohydrate esterase [CE] family 1 enzyme) released ferulic acid from methylferulate, wheat bran, corn fiber, and XOS(FA,Ac), a corn fiber-derived substrate enriched in O-acetyl and ferulic acid esters, but exhibited negligible activity on sugar acetates. As expected, the P. ruminicola Axe1-6A enzyme, which was predicted to possess two distinct esterase family domains (CE1 and CE6), released ferulic acid from the same substrates as Xyn10D-Fae1 and was also able to cleave O-acetyl ester bonds from various acetylated oligosaccharides (AcXOS). The P. ruminicola 23 AxeA1, which is not assigned to a CE family, and Axe7A (CE7) were found to be acetyl esterases that had activity toward a broad range of mostly nonpolymeric acetylated substrates along with AcXOS. All enzymes were inhibited by the proximal location of other side groups like 4-O-methylglucuronic acid, ferulic acid, or acetyl groups. The unique diversity of carbohydrate esterases in P. ruminicola 23 likely gives it the ability to hydrolyze substituents on the xylan backbone and enhances its capacity to efficiently degrade hemicellulose.",Applied and environmental microbiology,"['D003001', 'D019295', 'D003373', 'D004789', 'D057075', 'D004926', 'D004950', 'D004952', 'D015964', 'D005798', 'D006863', 'D009584', 'D020411', 'D011134', 'D045243', 'D019032', 'D013696', 'D014908', 'D014990', 'D003313']","['Cloning, Molecular', 'Computational Biology', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Assays', 'Escherichia coli', 'Esterases', 'Esters', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Nitrogen', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polysaccharides', 'Prevotella ruminicola', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Temperature', 'Triticum', 'Xylans', 'Zea mays']",Biochemical characterization and relative expression levels of multiple carbohydrate esterases of the xylanolytic rumen bacterium Prevotella ruminicola 23 grown on an ester-enriched substrate.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'genetics', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'enzymology', None, None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21742923,2011

To determine the potential confounding of these products on 2-aminoacetophenone breath analysis, screening for this volatile was performed in the laboratory by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a food challenge study carried out. 2-Aminoacetophenone was detected in four of the 78 samples tested in vitro: corn chips and canned tuna (high pmol mol(-1)) and egg white and one of the three beers (low pmol mol(-1)). No 2-aminoacetophenone was detected in the CF medication or cosmetics tested. Twenty-eight out of 30 environmental air samples were negative for 2-aminoacetophenone (below 50 pmol mol(-1)). A challenge study with ten healthy subjects was performed to determine if 2-aminoacetophenone from corn chips was detectable on the breath after consumption. Analysis of mixed breath samples reported that the levels of 2-aminoacetophenone were immediately elevated after corn chip consumption, but after 2 h the level of 2-aminoacetophenone had reduced back to the 'baseline' for each subject.",Journal of breath research,"['D000098', 'D015415', 'D001944', 'D003550', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D011552', 'D011550', 'D012680']","['Acetophenones', 'Biomarkers', 'Breath Tests', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Pseudomonas Infections', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']","Potential sources of 2-aminoacetophenone to confound the Pseudomonas aeruginosa breath test, including analysis of a food challenge study.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000382', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000175', 'Q000737', None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'microbiology', 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'diagnosis', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701048,2012
21700512,"Perfluorochemicals (PFC's) are widely spread in the environment and have been detected in blood of wildlife and humans world-wide. Recently, various toxic effects of PFC's in laboratory rats have been demonstrated, resulting in increased government concerns regarding the presence of PFC's in the environment and the implications they have on human health. In the last decade, various analytical methods have been developed for the analysis of PFC's in different matrices whereby the majority of methods have utilised liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Here we describe an optimized method for the quantitation of PFC's, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), in food packaging, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sealant tape and drinking water. The method involved PFC's extraction via off-line SPE followed by separation using reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a Phenyl-Hexyl column coupled with ion-trap (IT) mass spectrometric detection. The optimized approach minimized ion-suppression effects commonly seen with conventional elution buffers, improving detection limits down to 25 pg/mL and allowed effective quantitation down to 50 pg/mL for PFOA and PFOS. The optimized LC-MS method detected PFOA and other PFC's in microwave popcorn packaging and PFOA in PTFE sealant tape in the low μg/kg. In all samples, PFOS was not detected.","Journal of chromatography.

21644119,"Fumonisins occur mainly in maize and they produce alterations on sphingolipid metabolism, unbalancing the sphinganine (Sa)/sphingosine (So) ratio. This alteration has been proposed as a biomarker of fumonisin exposure. The objective of this study was to establish the urinary and plasmatic levels of Sa, So as well as the ratio Sa/So from a sample of the Catalonian (Spain) population exposed to fumonisins at low levels. Firstly, plasma and urinary Sa and So levels and the ratio Sa/So were compared between two population groups, and later urinary Sa and So levels from corn food consumers and a control group were monitored for 2 weeks under controlled intake of corn foods. Sa and So levels were determined in urine and blood samples using validated methods using HPLC with fluorescence detection. Significant differences were not found in urine samples when Sa/So ratios were compared from corn food consumers and non-consumers, while significant differences were found in urine and plasma samples, but evidence of the mechanism of action of fumonisins was not apparent. Through a time-course study we have narrowed down the day in which the maximum alteration of Sa/So ratio should be expected in humans. This paper reports some useful information to improve the design of studies to validate the ratio Sa/So as a possible biomarker of fumonisin exposure.","Food additives & contaminants.

After extraction of aflatoxins from cereal matrices with a mixture of methanol/water 8:2 (v/v), the analytes were rapidly transferred from the extract to another small volume of organic solvent, chloroform, by DLLME. Aflatoxins were determined using high performance liquid chromatography with florescence detection and photochemical post-column derivatization. Parameters affecting both extraction and DLLME procedures, such as extraction solvent, type and volume of DLLME extractant, volume of water and salt effect, were systematically investigated and optimized to achieve the best extraction efficiency. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the whole analytical method provides enrichment factors around 2.5 times and detection limits (0.01-0.17 μg kg(-1)) below the maximum levels imposed by current regulation for aflatoxins in cereals and cereal products intended for direct human consumption. Recoveries (67-92%) and repeatability (RSD<10, n=3), tested in three different cereal matrices, meet the performance criteria required by EC Regulation No. 401/2006 for the determination of the levels of mycotoxins in foodstuffs.

21616200,"A reliance on self-reported dietary intake measures is a common research limitation, thus the need for dietary biomarkers. Added-sugar intake may play a role in the development and progression of obesity and related comorbidities; common sweeteners include corn and sugar cane derivatives. These plants contain a high amount of ¹³C, a naturally occurring stable carbon isotope. Consumption of these sweeteners, of which sugar-sweetened beverages are the primary dietary source, might be reflected in the δ¹³C value of blood. Fingerstick blood represents an ideal substrate for bioassay because of its ease of acquisition. The objective of this investigation was to determine if the δ¹³C value of fingerstick blood is a potential biomarker of added-sugar and sugar-sweetened beverage intake. Individuals aged 21 years and older (n = 60) were recruited to attend three laboratory visits; assessments completed at each visit depended upon a randomly assigned sequence (sequence one or two). The initial visit included assessment of height, weight, and dietary intake (sequence one: beverage intake questionnaire, sequence two: 4-day food intake record). Sequence one participants completed a food intake record at visit two, and nonfasting blood samples were obtained via routine fingersticks at visits one and three. Sequence two participants completed a beverage intake questionnaire at visit two, and provided fingerstick blood samples at visits two and three. Samples were analyzed for δ¹³C value using natural abundance stable isotope mass spectrometry. δ¹³C value was compared to dietary outcomes in all participants, as well as among those in the highest and lowest tertile of added-sugar intake. Reported mean added-sugar consumption was 66 ± 5 g/day, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was 330 ± 53 g/day and 134 ± 25 kcal/day. Mean fingerstick δ¹³C value was -19.94‰ ± 0.10‰, which differed by body mass index status. δ¹³C value was associated (all P < 0.05) with intake of total added sugars (g, r = 0.37; kcal, r = 0.37), soft drinks (g, r = 0.26; kcal, r = 0.27), and total sugar-sweetened beverage (g, r = 0.28; kcal, r = 0.35). The δ¹³C value in the lowest and the highest added-sugar intake tertiles were significantly different (mean difference = -0.48‰; P = 0.028).

21488490,"High ground-level ozone continues to be an important human, animal, and plant health impediment in the United States and especially in California's San Joaquin Valley (SJV). According to California state and regional air quality agencies, dairies are one of the major sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the SJV. A number of recently conducted studies reported emissions data from different dairy sources. However, limited data are currently available for silage and otherfeed storages on dairies, which could potentially contribute to ozone formation. Because the impact of different VOCs on ozone formation varies significantly from one molecular species to another, detailed characterization of VOC emissions is essential to include all the important contributors to atmospheric chemistry and especially atmospheric reactivity. The present research study identifies and quantifies the VOCs emitted from various silages and other feedstuffs. Experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber under controlled conditions. Almost 80 VOCs were identified and quantified from corn (Zea mays L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.),and cereal (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] and oat [Avena sativava L.] grains) silages, total mixed ration (TMR), almond (Amygdalus communis L.) shells and hulls using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography. The results revealed high concentrations of emitted alcohols and other oxygenated species. Lower concentrations of highly reactive alkenes and aldehydes were also detected.

However, quantification of some process byproducts, most notably acetamide, acetic acid and furfural, present several analytical challenges using conventional liquid chromatography methods. Therefore, we have developed a high-throughput gas chromatography based mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method in order to quantify relevant compounds without requiring time-consuming sample derivatization prior to analysis. Solvent extracts of untreated, ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) treated and dilute-acid treated corn stover were analyzed by this method. Biomass samples were extracted with acetone using an automated solvent extractor, serially diluted and directly analyzed using the proposed GC-MS method. Acetone was the only solvent amongst water, methanol and acetonitrile that did not contain detectable background levels of the target compounds or facilitate a buildup of plant-derived residues in the GC injector, which decreased analytical reproducibility. Quantitative results were based on the method of standard addition and external standard calibration curves.","Journal of chromatography.

21424962,"Trace element analysis plays an important role in oil characterisation and in the detection of oil adulteration because the quality of edible oils and fats is affected by their trace metal content. In this study, the quantification of selected metals in various oils and fats (rice oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, soy oil, olive oil, light margarine, regular margarine and butter) was carried out using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) after sample emulsification. FAAS was used to determine the Na, K, Ca, Mg, Zn and Fe levels in the samples, while GFAAS was used for quantifying Cr, Ni, As, Pb, Cd, Cu and Mn, as these elements appeared in the samples at much lower concentrations. Tween-80 and Triton X-100 were employed as surfactants, and emulsions were prepared by a conventional method that involved heating and mixing of the constituents. Complete stabilisation was achieved through magnetic stirring for 15 min at room temperature. The evaluated figures of merit were linearity, accuracy and sensitivity, which were determined by the characteristic concentration and mass. Analysis of spiked samples demonstrated accuracy, which ranged from 90% (Na) to 112% (Fe) for FAAS and from 83% (Cd) to 121% (Pb) for GFAAS measurements. Atomic absorption spectrometry proved to be a promising approach for the analysis of metals in emulsified edible oils and fats. Additionally, under appropriate emulsification conditions (formulation, stirring time and temperature), the emulsions were homogeneous, had excellent stability, and had appropriate viscosity. The proposed method has proved to be simple, sensitive, reproducible, and economical.","Food additives & contaminants.

Many of the identified proteins catalogued in RiceRBP had not previously been annotated or predicted to bind RNA. RiceRBP provides tools to facilitate the analysis of the identified RNA-binding proteins, including information about predicted protein domains, phylogenetic relationships, and expression patterns of the identified genes. Importantly, RiceRBP also contains tools to search and analyze predicted RNA-binding protein orthologs in other plant species.

Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) can bind to proteins (PB FB(1)) and to other matrix components during food processing involving heat. The occurrence of bound fumonisins in processed corn foods is common. Another type of binding (or association) relates to observed instability of fumonisins in rice flour, corn starch and corn meal at room temperature; this can affect the immunoaffinity column clean-up procedure in analysis of naturally contaminated starch-containing corn foods for fumonisins. The occurrence of N-fatty acylated fumonisin derivatives in retail fried corn foods has also been demonstrated.

The method involved a XAD-2 resin cartridge coupled to a low volume air pump at 2 L min⁻¹ over 8 hours. Pesticides were recovered from the resin using sonication with n-hexane:ethyl acetate and determined by GC-MS. Good accuracy (76-128%) and precision (CV < 20%) were obtained for atrazine, chlorpyrifos, alpha- and beta-endosulfan, endosulfan sulfate, flutriafol, malathion, metolachlor and permethrin. Method detection ranged from 9.0 to 17.9 ng m⁻³. This method was applied to 61 gas phase samples collected between December 2008 and June 2009. Atrazine and endosulfan were detected both in urban and rural areas indicating the importance of atmospheric dispersion of pesticides in tropical areas. The simple and efficient extraction method and sampling system employed was considered suitable for identifying pesticides in areas of intense agricultural production.","Journal of environmental science and health.

21314472,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are commonly used as commercial flame retardants in a variety of products, including plastics and textiles. Previous studies in our laboratory, and in the literature, showed that exposure to a specific PBDE congener (PBDE 47) during a critical period of brain development may lead to developmental delays and hyperactivity in adulthood. To date, the underlying causes of these behavioral alterations are unknown, although in vitro studies linked PBDEs with potential alterations in neurotransmitter levels, particularly acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA). Alterations in DA function have also been noted in cases of hyperactivity in rodents and humans. The current study examined monoamine levels in male mice acutely exposed to corn oil vehicle or PBDE 47 (1, 10, or 30 mg/kg) on postnatal day (PND) 10. Animals were sacrificed on PND 15, PND 20, and in adulthood (131-159 days old). The cortex, striatum, and cerebellum were isolated and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the concentration of monoamines within each brain region. A statistically significant increase in DA levels was seen within the cortex, regardless of age, but only in the 10-mg/kg PBDE treatment group. While these effects did not show a monotonic dose response, we previously reported hyperactivity in littermates in the same dose group, but not at the lower or higher dose. Thus, early developmental exposure to PBDE 47 alters the levels of cortical DA in male mice, which may correlate with behavioral observations in littermates.",Drug and chemical toxicology,"['D000109', 'D000818', 'D000833', 'D001921', 'D001923', 'D002531', 'D002540', 'D002851', 'D003342', 'D004298', 'D005260', 'D005411', 'D055768', 'D008297', 'D051379', 'D008810', 'D023382']","['Acetylcholine', 'Animals', 'Animals, Suckling', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Corpus Striatum', 'Dopamine', 'Female', 'Flame Retardants', 'Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute']",Neurochemical changes following a single dose of polybrominated diphenyl ether 47 in mice.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000633', 'Q000633', None, None, None, None]","['analysis', None, None, 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'toxicity', 'toxicity', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21314472,2011

The digestion hydrolyzes all common sugars, starch, and starch derivatives down to their monosaccharide components, glucose, fructose, and galactose, which are then quantitated by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with photodiode array detection. Method validation consisted of specificity testing and 10 days of analyzing various spike levels of mixed sugars, maltodextrin, and corn starch.

21220762,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) possess significant phytase activity in the mature grains. Maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) possess little or virtually no preformed phytase activity in the mature grain and depend fully on de novo synthesis during germination. Here, it is demonstrated that wheat, barley, maize, and rice all possess purple acid phosphatase (PAP) genes that, expressed in Pichia pastoris, give fully functional phytases (PAPhys) with very similar enzyme kinetics. Preformed wheat PAPhy was localized to the protein crystalloid of the aleurone vacuole. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that PAPhys possess four conserved domains unique to the PAPhys. In barley and wheat, the PAPhy genes can be grouped as PAPhy_a or PAPhy_b isogenes (barley, HvPAPhy_a, HvPAPhy_b1, and HvPAPhy_b2; wheat, TaPAPhy_a1, TaPAPhy_a2, TaPAPhy_b1, and TaPAPhy_b2). In rice and maize, only the b type (OsPAPhy_b and ZmPAPhy_b, respectively) were identified. HvPAPhy_a and HvPAPhy_b1/b2 share 86% and TaPAPhya1/a2 and TaPAPhyb1/b2 share up to 90% (TaPAPhy_a2 and TaPAPhy_b2) identical amino acid sequences. despite of this, PAPhy_a and PAPhy_b isogenes are differentially expressed during grain development and germination. In wheat, it was demonstrated that a and b isogene expression is driven by different promoters (approximately 31% identity). TaPAPhy_a/b promoter reporter gene expression in transgenic grains and peptide mapping of TaPAPhy purified from wheat bran and germinating grains confirmed that the PAPhy_a isogene set present in wheat/barley but not in rice/maize is the origin of high phytase activity in mature grains.",Plant physiology,"['D010832', 'D000135', 'D000595', 'D003001', 'D018076', 'D015971', 'D018506', 'D018525', 'D006023', 'D001467', 'D007700', 'D008969', 'D012275', 'D010802', 'D010944', 'D012639', 'D016415', 'D053719', 'D013997', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['6-Phytase', 'Acid Phosphatase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Germination', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hordeum', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oryza', 'Phylogeny', 'Plants', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Time Factors', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']","Cloning and characterization of purple acid phosphatase phytases from wheat, barley, maize, and rice.","['Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000201', 'Q000166', None, None, None, 'Q000166', 'Q000201']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'genetics', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'enzymology', None, None, 'enzymology', None, 'enzymology', 'cytology', None, None, None, 'cytology', 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21220762,2011

20948525,"The consumption of fructose, largely in the form of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), has risen over the past several decades and is thought to contribute negatively to metabolic health. However, the fructose content of foods and beverages produced with HFCS is not disclosed and estimates of fructose content are based on the common assumption that the HFCS used contains 55% fructose. The objective of this study was to conduct an objective laboratory analysis of the sugar content and composition in popular sugar-sweetened beverages with a particular focus on fructose content. Twenty-three sugar-sweetened beverages along with four standard solutions were analyzed for sugar profiles using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in an independent, certified laboratory. Total sugar content was calculated as well as percent fructose in the beverages that use HFCS as the sole source of fructose. Results showed that the total sugar content of the beverages ranged from 85 to 128% of what was listed on the food label. The mean fructose content in the HFCS used was 59% (range 47-65%) and several major brands appear to be produced with HFCS that is 65% fructose. Finally, the sugar profile analyses detected forms of sugar that were inconsistent with what was listed on the food labels. This analysis revealed significant deviations in sugar amount and composition relative to disclosures from producers. In addition, the tendency for use of HFCS that is higher in fructose could be contributing to higher fructose consumption than would otherwise be assumed.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","['D000704', 'D001628', 'D002851', 'D004040', 'D002149', 'D005632', 'D005947', 'D009765', 'D013549']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Beverages', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dietary Carbohydrates', 'Energy Intake', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Obesity', 'Sweetening Agents']",Sugar content of popular sweetened beverages based on objective laboratory analysis: focus on fructose content.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20948525,2011
20938852,"An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous determination of 10 mycotoxins in grain was developed. The selected mycotoxins were: deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fusarenon X, moniliformin, zearalenone, zearalanone, ochratoxin A and ochratoxin B. The samples were extracted with aqueous acetonitrile (84 : 16, v/v) and purified by reliable laboratory-made mixed cartridges. The analytes were separated on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm) and eluted with a mobile phase of water containing 0.2% aqueous ammonia and acetonitrile/methanol (90 : 10, v/v). All mycotoxins were detected with a Waters Micromass Quattro Ultima Pt tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in negative electrospray ionization using multiple reaction monitoring mode. Accurate determination was achieved by employing commercial ¹³C₁₅-deoxynivalenol as internal standard, which compensated for target loss and eliminated matrix effects. The established method was further validated by determining the linearity (R² > 0.9990), average recovery (75.8-106.5%), sensitivity (limit of quantitation 0.09-8.48 µg kg⁻¹) and precision (relative standard deviation ≤ 6.9%). It was shown to be a suitable method for simultaneous determination of 10 mycotoxins in grain. Finally, a total of 69 corn samples randomly collected from eastern and northern China were analyzed. The results showed that deoxynivalenol was the most frequently detected contaminant, whilst 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, nivalenol, zearalenone, zearalanone, fusarenon X and moniliformin also occurred frequently.

High-performance liquid chromatography methods to determine ferulate dimers often lack specificity; methods for trimers did not exist yet. A method for the determination of 11 cell wall-bound ferulate dehydrodimers and -trimers was developed, including the crucial separation of the di/trimers from the often dominating phenolic monomers. Validation parameters for the basic calibration of the dimers and trimers met our acceptance criteria.

20728087,"A sensitive and reliable liquid chromatography/photoionization (APPI) tandem mass spectrometry method has been developed for determining nine selected mycotoxins in wheat and maize samples. The analytes were chosen on the basis of the mycotoxins under EU Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006, i.e., deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZON), aflatoxins (AFs), and ochratoxin A (OTA), and considering the possibility of a near future regulation for T-2 and HT-2 toxins. Mycotoxins were extracted from samples by means of an one-step solvent extraction without any cleanup. The developed multi-mycotoxin method permits simultaneous, simple, and rapid determination of several co-existing toxins separated in a single chromatographic run, in which AFs, T-2 and HT-2 toxin are acquired in positive, while OTA, DON and ZON in negative mode. Although a moderate signal suppression was noticeable, matrix effect did not give significant differences at p=0.05. Then, calibration in standard solution were used for quantitation. Based on the EU Commission Decision 2002/657/EC, the method was in-house validated in terms of ruggedness, specificity, linearity, trueness, within-laboratory reproducibility, decision limit (CCalpha) and detection capability (CCbeta). For all the analytes, the regression coefficient r ranged between 0.8752 (DON in wheat) and 0.9465 (ZON in maize), biases related to mean concentrations were from -13% to +12% of the nominal spiking level, and the overall within-laboratory reproducibility ranged 3-16%; finally, CCalpha values did not differ more than 20% and CCbeta not more than 42% from their respective maximum limit.

Soybean meal can affect pig performance in the first few weeks following weaning and elicit specific antibodies in weaned piglets. Though maize is a major component of pig feed, it is not known if any of the maize proteins can elicit immunological response in young pigs. In this study, we have identified a prominent 27 kDa protein from maize as an immunodominant protein in young pigs. This protein, like some known allergens, exhibited resistance to pepsin digestion in vitro. Several lines of evidence identify the immunodominant 27 kDa protein as a gamma-zein, a maize seed storage protein. First, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of different solubility classes of maize seed proteins revealed the presence of an abundant 27 kDa protein in the prolamin (zein) fraction. Antibodies raised against the purified maize 27 kDa gamma-zein also reacted against the same protein recognized by the young pig serum. Additionally, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the peptides generated by trypsin digestion of the immunodominant 27 kDa protein showed significant homology to the maize 27 kDa gamma-zein.

20339844,"Mycotoxins are natural contaminants produced by a range of fungal species. Their common occurrence in food and feed poses a threat to the health of humans and animals. This threat is caused either by the direct contamination of agricultural commodities or by a ""carry-over"" of mycotoxins and their metabolites into animal tissues, milk, and eggs after feeding of contaminated hay or corn. As a consequence of their diverse chemical structures and varying physical properties, mycotoxins exhibit a wide range of biological effects. Individual mycotoxins can be genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and oestrogenic. To protect consumer health and to reduce economic losses, surveillance and control of mycotoxins in food and feed has become a major objective for producers, regulatory authorities and researchers worldwide. However, the variety of chemical structures makes it impossible to use one single technique for mycotoxin analysis. Hence, a vast number of analytical methods has been developed and validated. The heterogeneity of food matrices combined with the demand for a fast, simultaneous and accurate determination of multiple mycotoxins creates enormous challenges for routine analysis. The most crucial issues will be discussed in this review.

20334192,"The matrix effects in HPLC/electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS analysis are difficult to compensate for because of their large variability. It is, therefore, often more practical to include uncertainty due to the matrix effect into the uncertainty budget rather than try to compensate. This work presents an empirical approach--the matrix effect graph approach--for estimating the uncertainty due to the matrix effect in HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. At certain time intervals (1 month), a calibration graph using extracts of different fruits/vegetables as calibration solutions is prepared, and a regression line is fitted through these data. These fruits/vegetables may be either from the commodity group of the samples or from different commodity groups. The relative residuals of the calibration point peak areas are calculated and plotted against the measurement time. We term the resulting graph the matrix effect graph. The root mean square of the relative residuals is calculated and used as the estimate of relative uncertainty of the sample peak areas caused by the matrix effect. The matrix effect graph obtained over fruits/vegetables from different commodity groups can also be used to identify fruits/vegetables with extreme matrix effects. The matrix effect graph approach was used for determination of thiabendazole, aldicarb, imazalil, and methiocarb and was validated with tomato, cucumber, and sweet corn matrixes at the 0.5 mg/kg concentration level. When different commodity groups were used to compile the matrix effect graph, results of analysis of all samples agreed with the spiked concentrations within the expanded uncertainties (at k=2 level). When the matrix effect graph was compiled using fruits from the same commodity group as the analyzed samples (fruiting vegetables in this case), agreement was found in 98% of the cases.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002851', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D006801', 'D010573', 'D021241', 'D014675']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Vegetables']",Electrospray ionization matrix effect as an uncertainty source in HPLC/ESI-MS pesticide residue analysis.,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","['methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20334192,2010

Dot-immunogold filtration assay (DIGFA) of AFB(1) on NCM was developed in this study. At first, the colloidal gold was synthesized and colloidal gold-monoclonal antibody (McAb) conjugates against AFB(1) were prepared at pH 7.0 of colloidal gold solution, 0.018mg/mL of McAb. Then the colloidal gold-McAb conjugates were used to develop AFB(1) DIGFA, which detection time was only 15min, six times less than that of ELISA. With this method to determine the standard AFB(1) solution, the results demonstrated a visual detection limit of approximately 2ng/mL of AFB(1), which was similar to that of ELISA. This method had good specificities for AFG(1), AFG(2) and AFM(1) and a little cross-reactivity with AFB(2). 45 food samples collected from the markets were subjected to DIGFA and the results showed that one corn sample was positive and in agreement that of HPLC.

20221935,"The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between fluorescence emissions of corn kernels inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and aflatoxin contamination levels within the kernels. Aflatoxin contamination in corn has been a long-standing problem plaguing the grain industry with potentially devastating consequences to corn growers. In this study, aflatoxin-contaminated corn kernels were produced through artificial inoculation of corn ears in the field with toxigenic A. flavus spores. The kernel fluorescence emission data were taken with a fluorescence hyperspectral imaging system when corn kernels were excited with ultraviolet light. Raw fluorescence image data were preprocessed and regions of interest in each image were created for all kernels. The regions of interest were used to extract spectral signatures and statistical information. The aflatoxin contamination level of single corn kernels was then chemically measured using affinity column chromatography. A fluorescence peak shift phenomenon was noted among different groups of kernels with different aflatoxin contamination levels. The fluorescence peak shift was found to move more toward the longer wavelength in the blue region for the highly contaminated kernels and toward the shorter wavelengths for the clean kernels. Highly contaminated kernels were also found to have a lower fluorescence peak magnitude compared with the less contaminated kernels. It was also noted that a general negative correlation exists between measured aflatoxin and the fluorescence image bands in the blue and green regions. The correlation coefficients of determination, r(2), was 0.72 for the multiple linear regression model. The multivariate analysis of variance found that the fluorescence means of four aflatoxin groups, <1, 1-20, 20-100, and >or=100 ng g(-1) (parts per billion), were significantly different from each other at the 0.01 level of alpha. Classification accuracy under a two-class schema ranged from 0.84 to 0.91 when a threshold of either 20 or 100 ng g(-1) was used. Overall, the results indicate that fluorescence hyperspectral imaging may be applicable in estimating aflatoxin content in individual corn kernels.","Food additives & contaminants.

The method focuses on analytes which are known to be produced by common maize and maize-silage contaminants. A simple pH-buffered sample extraction was developed on the basis of a very fast and simple method for analysis of multiple pesticide residues in food known as QuEChERS. The buffering effectively ensured a stable pH in samples of both well-ensiled maize (pH < 4) and of hot spots with fungal infection (pH > 7). No further clean-up was performed before analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

20112157,"From times immemorial, colorants, and flavorings have been used in foods. Color and flavor are the major attributes to the quality of a food product, affecting the appearance and acceptance of the product. As a consequence of the increased demand of natural flavoring and colorant from industries, there is a renewed interest in the research on the composition and recovery of natural food flavors and colors. Over the years, numerous procedures have been proposed for the isolation of aromatic compounds and colors from plant materials. Generally, the methods of extraction followed for aroma and pigment from plant materials are solvent extraction, hydro-distillation, steam distillation, and super critical carbon dioxide extraction. The application of enzymes in the extraction of oil from oil seeds like sunflower, corn, coconut, olives, avocado etc. are reported in literature. There is a great potential for this enzyme-based extraction technology with the selection of appropriate enzymes with optimized operating conditions. Various enzyme combinations are used to loosen the structural integrity of botanical material thereby enhancing the extraction of the desired flavor and color components. Recently enzymes have been used for the extraction of flavor and color from plant materials, as a pre-treatment of the raw material before subjecting the plant material to hydro distillation/solvent extraction. A deep knowledge of enzymes, their mode of action, conditions for optimum activity, and selection of the right type of enzymes are essential to use them effectively for extraction. Although the enzyme hydrolases such as lipases, proteases (chymotrypsin, subtilisin, thermolysin, and papain), esterases use water as a substrate for the reaction, they are also able to accept other nucleophiles such as alcohols, amines, thio-esters, and oximes. Advantages of enzyme-assisted extraction of flavor and color in some of the plant materials in comparison with conventional methods are dealt with in this reveiw.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,"['D002480', 'D025924', 'D004396', 'D057168', 'D004798', 'D005421', 'D005524', 'D006026', 'D006867', 'D010860', 'D010944', 'D011096', 'D012997', 'D014835']","['Cellulase', 'Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid', 'Coloring Agents', 'Distillation', 'Enzymes', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Food Technology', 'Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Hydrolases', 'Pigments, Biological', 'Plants', 'Polygalacturonase', 'Solvents', 'Volatilization']",Enzyme-assisted extraction of flavorings and colorants from plant materials.,"[None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'methods', None, 'isolation & purification', 'methods', None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20112157,2010

Carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was detected in 43% of the samples analyzed. Benz[a]anthracene and chrysene were detected in 37 and 45% of the samples, respectively, that did not contain BaP. Of the individual non-carcinogenic PAHs, naphthalene showed the highest mean concentration (14 microg kg(-1)), while for the carcinogenic PAHs, BaP (0.92 microg kg(-1)) and chrysene (0.87 microg kg(-1)) showed the highest mean values. Approximately 20% of the samples within the olive oil and cooking oil sub-categories exceeded the EU maximum tolerable limit for BaP, with the highest level of 6.77 and 11.1 microg kg(-1), respectively. For the fat sub-category, 9% of the samples exceeded the tolerance limit, with the highest level of 3.67 microg kg(-1).

Chemical composition, microscopic (atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy) and spectroscopic (attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ATR-FTIR) analyses were performed. Results showed that both pre-treatments improved the cellulose and lignin content with substantial removal of hemicellulose in the pre-treated biomasses. These values were slightly higher for hydrothermal compared to wet explosion pre-treatment. ATR-FTIR analyses also confirmed these results. Microscopic analysis showed that pre-treatments affected the biomass by partial difibration. Lignin deposition on the surface of the hydrothermally pre-treated fibre was very distinct while severe loss of fibril integrity was noticed with wet exploded fibre. The present study thus revealed that the lignin cannot be removed by the studied pre-treatments.

These observations provide a rationale for the development of new antidiabetic agents aimed at reducing serum RBP4 concentrations. In this study, we sought to determine whether retinoic acid (RA) administration decreases serum RBP4 and suppresses insulin resistance in diabetic ob/ob mice. All-trans RA [100 mug/(moused) in corn oil] was administered by stomach intubation to a group of ob/ob mice, with the control group receiving the vehicle for 16 d.

19926802,"Grass species represent a major source of food, feed, and fiber crops and potential feedstocks for biofuel production. Most of the biomass is contributed by cell walls that are distinct in composition from all other flowering plants. Identifying cell wall-related genes and their functions underpins a fundamental understanding of growth and development in these species. Toward this goal, we are building a knowledge base of the maize (Zea mays) genes involved in cell wall biology, their expression profiles, and the phenotypic consequences of mutation. Over 750 maize genes were annotated and assembled into gene families predicted to function in cell wall biogenesis. Comparative genomics of maize, rice (Oryza sativa), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) sequences reveal differences in gene family structure between grass species and a reference eudicot species. Analysis of transcript profile data for cell wall genes in developing maize ovaries revealed that expression within families differed by up to 100-fold. When transcriptional analyses of developing ovaries before pollination from Arabidopsis, rice, and maize were contrasted, distinct sets of cell wall genes were expressed in grasses. These differences in gene family structure and expression between Arabidopsis and the grasses underscore the requirement for a grass-specific genetic model for functional analyses. A UniformMu population proved to be an important resource in both forward- and reverse-genetics approaches to identify hundreds of mutants in cell wall genes.

24785177,"A survey was conducted to determine the occurrence of fumonisin B1, B2 and B3 during 2007 in 186 samples of organic and conventional locally available corn products. Samples included baby food (n = 62), corn flour (11), cornflakes (23), pasta (14), cookies (17) and other corn products (59) were obtained from popular markets of Valencia (Spain) and Perugia (Italy). The analytical method used pressurized liquid extraction and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole (QqQ) analyser. Of the 104 Spanish samples, 22% contained levels in the range of 2-449 µg kg(-1), 2-229 µg kg(-1) and 6-105 µg kg(-1) for FB1, FB2 and FB3, respectively, while 19 (23%) of the 82 Italian samples were positive with quantifiable levels between 2-235 µg kg(-1), 3-187 µg kg(-1), and 4-40 µg kg(-1) for fumonisins B1, B2 and B3, respectively. Overall, none of the Italian samples and only one organic baby food sample from a Spanish market was above the maximum permitted levels established by European legislation. Fumonisins were found mostly in corn flour followed by cookies and cornflakes. Eleven samples from Spain and nine samples from Italy were organic products, being contaminated the 72% and 77% of the samples, respectively. Analysis of the results showed that levels of fumonisins in corn products were similar in Italy and Spain. The safety of fumonisin intake through corn products was demonstrated by the calculation of the estimated daily intake of both populations considering organic and conventional products separately, which ranged from 1.7 × 10(-3) to 0.72 µg kg(-1) bw day(-1) and comparing them with the provisional maximum total daily intake (PMTDI) of 2 µg kg(-1) bw day(-1) established by the European Union.

Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) was used as a template molecule. A molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedure was developed for further application in the analysis of FB. The performance of the MIP throughout the clean-up of spiked bell pepper, rice and corn flake sample extracts was compared with the results obtained when using non-imprinted polymer, C(18), strong anion exchange and immunoaffinity sorbents. Extracts were analysed for FB with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after clean-up. Depending on the food matrix and the concentration range of the fumonisins, recoveries after MISPE varied from 62 to 86%, from 62 to 83%, and from 67 to 81% for fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)), fumonisin B(2) (FB(2)) and fumonisin B(3) (FB(3)), respectively. The selectivity of the synthesized MIP for mycotoxins belonging to the group of FB was confirmed by evaluating cross-reactivity from analogue structures and other mycotoxins. Analysis of 39 naturally contaminated samples (corn flakes) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry indicated that the synthesized MIP could be an excellent alternative for clean-up and pre-concentration of FB in food samples. Pearson correlations between immunoaffinity clean-up and MISPE were calculated and amounted to 0.923 for FB(1), 0.808 for FB(2), and 0.759 for FB(3). It was shown that the developed MIP could be reused more than 50 times.

Two levels of both sodium chloride (0.4% and 2%) and barley malt (0.8% and 5%) were added to the unextruded corn flour, and six levels of sucrose (3-10%) were used. The addition of sucrose at the lowest salt content (0.4%) as well as salt, either at 0.4% or at 2%, led to a significant decrease of FB1 levels in extruded samples, whereas malt, either at 0.8% or at 5%, did not significantly affect FB1 stability. Decontamination rates depended on the concentrations of added ingredients and ranged from 2% to 92%. The greatest reductions in FB1 content were achieved with extrusion cooking with a high salt content, whilst the lowest reductions were the result of processing corn flour with low contents of both salt and sucrose.

Combinations of starch granules with isolated alpha-amylases from both species showed similar patterns of granule degradation. In vitro enzymatic degradation of maize starch granules by the three different alpha-amylase fractions began by creating small holes and crater-like areas on the surface of the granules.

Granules from potato did not show formation of pits and craters on their surface, but presented extensive erosion in their interior. For all types of starch, as soon as the interior of the starch granule was reached, the inner layers of amylose and amylopectin were differentially hydrolyzed, resulting in a striated pattern.

However, there are sporadic reports of fumonisin contamination in wheat worldwide. The rice adherent fungus Gibberella fujikuroi is taxonomically closely related to F. verticillioides. Therefore, the potential risk of fumonisin contamination in rice and wheat is significant.

After beta-amylolysis, amylose was enriched (from 25.4 to 33.2% for NCS and from 27.5 to 32.8% for WS) and the branch density was increased (from 5.2 to 7.7% for NCS and from 5.3 to 7.9% for WS). Cryo-SEM images showed that the autoclave treatment led to the formation of a low-swelling, high-density gel network, whereas beta-amylolysis nearly demolished the network structure. The loss of A-type crystalline structure and the formation of B- and V-type structures resulted from autoclave, which suggests the formation of amylose-based ordered structure. Englyst assay indicated that, due to beta-amylolysis, the resistant starch (RS) content was increased to 30 from 11% of native NCS and to 23 from 9% of native WS. In contrast, autoclave showed only minor impact on RS levels. The increase of RS observed in this study is associated with enhanced branch density, which is different from the four types of RS commonly defined.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000688', 'D004063', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D008954', 'D014908', 'D014961', 'D003313']","['Amylose', 'Digestion', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Models, Biological', 'Triticum', 'X-Ray Diffraction', 'Zea mays']",Autoclave and beta-amylolysis lead to reduced in vitro digestibility of starch.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19572519,2009
19485209,"Following previous observations of apparent instability of fumonisin B1 in corn starch and corn meal, immunoaffinity column (IAC) cleanup, of the type used in the analysis of commercial starch-containing corn foods for fumonisins, was investigated. Foods analyzed for naturally occurring fumonisins B1, B2, and B3 included corn flour (3 different products), corn meal, and corn flakes. In 2 series of experiments, fractions were eluted by gravity or vacuum from narrow- or wide-bore Fumonitest IACs either with 2 x 2 mL methanol, followed by 2 mL methanol-water (8 + 2, v/v), or with 2 mL methanol, then 2 mL methanol-water (8 + 2, v/v). The ratio (%) of fumonisin B1 concentration in the first methanol eluate to the total concentration measured from all eluates in most cases varied from 25-70%. Incomplete recoveries were also observed for fumonisins B2 and B3. It is concluded that there can be a major underestimation of naturally occurring fumonisins in methods using only methanol elution for IAC cleanup, as in AOAC INTERNATIONAL Official Method 2001.04 (accuracy of these methods had been determined only by spiking the food with fumonisins). Elution with 2 x 2 mL methanol-water (8 + 2, v/v) was chosen as a practical procedure; means of 81-98% of the total fumonisin B1 concentration were found in the first eluate, except for corn flakes and 2 experiments with corn meal.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002846', 'D002851', 'D005506', 'D037341', 'D000432', 'D012997', 'D014867', 'D003313']","['Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Fumonisins', 'Methanol', 'Solvents', 'Water', 'Zea mays']",Incomplete recoveries of fumonisins present in naturally contaminated corn foods from an immunoaffinity column.,"['Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000302', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['methods', None, 'analysis', 'isolation & purification', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19485209,2009

Pesticides were extracted from infant foods by using the procedure known as the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method. Quantification was based on matrix-matched standard calibration curves with the use of an isotopically labeled standard or a chemical analogue as the internal standard to obtain method accuracy. The method performance parameters, including overall recovery, intermediate precision, and measurement uncertainty, were evaluated on the basis of a nested design. The performance results were calculated by using a compiled SAS program that provided a semiautomated procedure for handling a large number of calculations in a few seconds.

To test whether this is also a feature of other ECM fungi, we searched a survey genome database of Amanita bisporigera with the proteins found in the secretome of Trichoderma reesei (syn. Hypocrea jecorina), a biochemically well-characterized industrial fungus. Additional proteins were also used as queries to compensate for major groups of cell-wall-degrading enzymes lacking in the secretome of T. reesei and to substantiate conclusions drawn from the T. reesei collection.

19285423,"The effect of cadmium (Cd) on both the absorption of important nutrients and the synthesis of low molecular weight thiols (LMWTs) was investigated in corn plants. The inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy results demonstrated that the concentration of Cd in tissues (mainly in roots) increased as the concentration in the medium increased. In addition, the concentration of phosphorus increased in roots of Cd treated plants but remained at normal concentration in shoots. On the other hand, the uptake of sulfur (S) followed a similar trend as the Cd uptake. The concentration of S and the production of LMWT were found to increase significantly upon exposure to Cd. The results of the X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses indicated that Cd within tissues was bound to S ligands with interatomic distances of 2.51-2.52 A.

The RS percentages in the native starch (NS) of 1-4 were 55.2, 1.1, 5.7, and 1.1%, respectively. All NS were evaluated for pasting properties with a rapid viscoanalyzer (RVA) and for thermal properties with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). NS 1 had a low peak viscosity (PV) caused by incomplete gelatinization, whereas NS 3 had the greatest PV and breakdown of all four starch types. On the DSC, NS 2 had the lowest onset temperature and greatest enthalpy. NS 1 and 3 had similar onset and peak temperatures, both higher than those of NS 2 and 4. The gel strength of NS heated with a RVA was evaluated by using a texture analyzer immediately after RVA heating (fresh, RVA-F) and after the gel had been stored at 4 degrees C for 10 days (retrograded, RVA-R). NS 1 gel was watery and had the lowest strength (30 g) among starch gel types. NS 3 gel, although exhibiting syneresis, had greater gel strength than NS 2 and 4. The structures of the NS, the RS isolated from the NS (RS-NS), the RS isolated from RVA-F (RS-RVA-F), and the RS isolated from RVA-R (RS-RVA-R) were evaluated by using size exclusion chromatography. NS 1 had a greater percentage of amylose (AM) (58.3%) than the other NS (20.4-26.8%).

19249817,"The pomegranate fruit ( Punica granatum ) has become an international high-value crop for the production of commercial pomegranate juice (PJ). The perceived consumer value of PJ is due in large part to its potential health benefits based on a significant body of medical research conducted with authentic PJ. To establish criteria for authenticating PJ, a new International Multidimensional Authenticity Specifications (IMAS) algorithm was developed through consideration of existing databases and comprehensive chemical characterization of 45 commercial juice samples from 23 different manufacturers in the United States. In addition to analysis of commercial juice samples obtained in the United States, data from other analyses of pomegranate juice and fruits including samples from Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Syria, India, and China were considered in developing this protocol. There is universal agreement that the presence of a highly constant group of six anthocyanins together with punicalagins characterizes polyphenols in PJ. At a total sugar concentration of 16 degrees Brix, PJ contains characteristic sugars including mannitol at >0.3 g/100 mL. Ratios of glucose to mannitol of 4-15 and of glucose to fructose of 0.8-1.0 are also characteristic of PJ. In addition, no sucrose should be present because of isomerase activity during commercial processing. Stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry as > -25 per thousand assures that there is no added corn or cane sugar added to PJ. Sorbitol was present at <0.025 g/100 mL; maltose and tartaric acid were not detected. The presence of the amino acid proline at >25 mg/L is indicative of added grape products. Malic acid at >0.1 g/100 mL indicates adulteration with apple, pear, grape, cherry, plum, or aronia juice. Other adulteration methods include the addition of highly concentrated aronia, blueberry, or blackberry juices or natural grape pigments to poor-quality juices to imitate the color of pomegranate juice, which results in abnormal anthocyanin profiles. To adjust the astringent taste of poor-quality juice or peel extract, addition of nonpomegranate sugars is a commonly detected adulteration method. The profile generated from these analyses combined with information from existing databases and published literature has been integrated into a validated IMAS for PJ, which can be utilized to detect PJ adulteration. In this survey of commercial pomegranate juices, only 6 of 23 strictly met all of the IMAS criteria.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000465', 'D000596', 'D000872', 'D001628', 'D002241', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D047348', 'D038622', 'D029561', 'D012016']","['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Anthocyanins', 'Beverages', 'Carbohydrates', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Hydrolyzable Tannins', 'Internationality', 'Lythraceae', 'Reference Values']",International multidimensional authenticity specification (IMAS) algorithm for detection of commercial pomegranate juice adulteration.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19249817,2009

However, because of its limited production and of its relatively high price, some beekeepers or unscrupulous traders do not hesitate to modify and falsify this natural product in order to try to increase its market value. Then, these involved falsification practices, for example intentional addition of cheap sugar syrup to honeys, are sometimes difficult to detect. An effective and simple analytical method is proposed in order to detect adulteration in honey by analysis of polysaccharide profiles. Samples were previously treated with reversed-phase solid phase extraction first to remove monosaccharides and small oligosaccharides and second to concentrate simultaneously traces of polysaccharides. A chromatographic separation using anion exchange stationary phase and pulse amperometric detection was further performed. Polysaccharide fingerprints (degree of polymerization from 11 to 17) were shown to be present in laboratory doped samples, and not detectable or present at very low concentrations in the authentic honey samples.

This study tested the interdependence of the maize enzymes starch synthase IIa (SSIIa), SSIII, starch branching enzyme IIb (SBEIIb), and SBEIIa for assembly into multisubunit complexes. Mutations that eliminated any one of those proteins also prevented the others from assembling into a high molecular mass form of approximately 670 kD, so that SSIII, SSIIa, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb most likely all exist together in the same complex. SSIIa, SBEIIb, and SBEIIa, but not SSIII, were also interdependent for assembly into a complex of approximately 300 kD. SSIII, SSIIa, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb copurified through successive chromatography steps, and SBEIIa, SBEIIb, and SSIIa coimmunoprecipitated with SSIII in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. SBEIIa and SBEIIb also were retained on an affinity column bearing a specific conserved fragment of SSIII located outside of the SS catalytic domain. Additional proteins that copurified with SSIII in multiple biochemical methods included the two known isoforms of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), large and small subunits of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and the sucrose synthase isoform SUS-SH1.

19101834,"Trichloroethane functions in cosmetics as a solvent. Although Trichloroethane has been reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used in cosmetic products, an industry survey found that it is not in current use in the cosmetic industry. Trichloroethane is considered a Class I ozone-depleting substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its use is prohibited in the United States, unless considered essential. The FDA has stated that Trichloroethane's use in cosmetics is considered nonessential. Trichloroethane is detected by gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and gas-liquid chromatography. In rats, Trichloroethane, whether inhaled or injected, is mostly expelled intact from the body through exhalation. A very small percentage is excreted in the urine. In humans, Trichloroethane is rapidly absorbed through the skin and eliminated in exhaled air and a very small percentage is excreted in urine. Inhaled Trichloroethane is eliminated in exhaled air. Acute oral LD(50) values have been reported as follows: 12.3 g/kg in male rats; 10.3 g/kg in female rats; 11.24 g/kg in female mice; 5.66 g/kg in female rabbits; and 9.47 g/kg in male guinea pigs. Acute toxicity studies using other routes of exposure, including subcutaneous injection and inhalation, produced no evidence of significant toxicity, except at very high exposure levels. Continuous inhalation exposure of rabbits to 750 mg/m(3) for 90 days did not produce any signs of toxicity. Continuous exposure of rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and monkeys to 500 ppm Trichloroethane for 6 months did not produce any signs of toxicity. Other short-term and subchronic inhalation exposures confirmed acute and short-term exposure findings that the toxic effects of inhalation were a function of both concentration and time. Rats receiving 750 or 1500 mg/kg day(- 1) Trichloroethane in corn oil by oral gavage 5 days per week for 78 weeks had reduced body weights and early mortality. Reduced body weights, decreased survival rates, and early mortality (in females) were found in mice dosed with 3000 or 6000 mg/kg day(- 1) (over the last 58 weeks; lower doses were administered for the first 20 weeks). Mice exposed to prolonged periods of Trichloroethane in an inhalation chamber had increased motor activity at levels up to 5000 ppm. Further increase of concentration of exposure resulted in less of an increase of motor activity until motor activity began to fall below normal at 10,000 ppm. Adverse effects on motor activity in rats were seen at exposures as low as 3000 ppm for 4 h. Rabbits had slight reddening and scaling after 10 24-h applications to abdominal skin of Trichloroethane mixed with 2.4% to 3.0% dioxane, and slight to moderate erythema, slight edema, and slight exfoliation was observed when 75% Trichloroethane and 25% tetrachloroethylene were applied to rabbit ears for 11 days. Undiluted Trichloroethane applied to the clipped backs of guinea pigs produced histopathologic damage in the epidermis. A primary irritation index of 5.22 (out of 8) was reported in rabbits. Trichloroethane applied to the eyes of rabbits resulted in transient irritation and apparent pain, but no corneal damage. There was no effect on gestation, pup survival, or growth in mice given Trichloroethane in drinking water at up to 5.83 mg/ml during mating and/or gestation. Rats exhibited no or minimal effects of ingestion of Trichloroethane up to 30 ppm in drinking water during mating and/or gestation. There was no effect on gestation, pup survival, or growth in mice or rats inhaling 875 ppm Trichloroethane. However, prenatal exposure of rodents to Trichloroethane can produce developmental toxicity in the form of delayed development in the offspring. Trichloroethane has been found to be mutagenic in the Ames assay in some studies and not mutagenic in others. Trichloroethane induced transformations in Fischer rat embryo cell system at 99 mu M, was not mutagenic using the mouse lymphoma assay at up to 0.51 mu g/ml, was equivocal in that assay when tested with S9, and was also equivocal in a sister-chromatid exchange assay using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells with and without S9. Mice ingesting 80,000 ppm Trichloroethane in their drinking water had an increase in the frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes. A peripheral blood micronucleus test in female mice was negative. Trichloroethane was not carcinogenic to rats when administered 1500 mg/kg by oral gavage 5 days/week for 78 weeks or in mice administered 6000 mg/kg. Exposure to 1500 ppm Trichloroethane vapor for 6 h/day, 5 days/week for 2 years likewise gave no indications of oncogenic effects in rats or mice. People who have been exposed to Trichloroethane have reported dizziness, lassitude, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, peripheral vascular collapse, impaired postural control, mild encephalopathy, perioral tingling, burning on the tongue and discomfort in the hands and feet. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel recognizes that Trichloroethane (1,1,1-Trichloroethane) has been declared a Class I ozone-depleting substance by the EPA and its use is limited to essential products. The FDA has determined that use of Trichloroethane in aerosol cosmetic products is considered nonessential.

Hb repletion efficiencies (means +/- SEM) did not differ between groups and, after 5 wk, were 20.8 +/- 2.1% for the standard Fe group and 20.9 +/- 2.1% for the high Fe group. Final total body Hb Fe contents did not differ between the standard [539 +/- 39 mg (9.7 +/- 0.7 micromol)] and high Fe [592 +/- 28 mg (10.6 +/- 0.5 micromol)] bean groups (P = 0.15). The increase in total body Hb Fe over the 5-wk feeding period was greater in the high Fe bean group [429 +/- 24 mg (7.7 +/- 0.4 micromol)] than in the standard Fe bean group [361 +/- 23 mg (6.4 +/- 0.4 micromol)] (P = 0.034).

The nutrients tested were MgSO4 and nitrogen sources; (NH4)2SO4, urea, yeast extract, peptone and corn steep liquor. The fermentation was tested in a separate hydrolysis and fermentation process using a low amount of inoculum (0.33 g kg(-1)) and a non-adapted baker's yeast strain. A factorial screening design revealed that yeast extract, peptone, corn steep liquor and MgSO4 were the most significant factors in obtaining a high fermentation rate, high ethanol yield and low glycerol formation. The highest volumetric ethanol productivity was 1.16 g kg(-1) h(-1) and with an ethanol yield close to maximum theoretical. The use of urea or (NH4)2SO4 separately, together or in combination with MgSO4 or vitamins did not improve fermentation rate and resulted in increased glycerol formation compared to the use of yeast extract.

19021821,"Flavor is a key factor contributing to consumer acceptance and repeat purchase of rice. Plant breeders focus on production yield and ignoring quality traits because there are no readily useable tools to evaluate quality. A systematic approach is needed for rice breeders to select rice with favorable flavor traits. Descriptive sensory analysis combined with chemical analysis provided an insight of sensory significance to interpret chemical data for a better understanding approach of rice flavor. This study was aimed to develop prediction models for sensory descriptors based on the volatile components derived from the gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) that would be useful to help select rice cultivars containing a satisfactory flavor to produce improved quality in rice breeding programs. Thirteen Korean specialty rice samples were evaluated for their flavor components using descriptive analysis and GC-O. Nineteen aroma attributes in cooked specialty rice samples were evaluated by 8 trained panelists and statistically correlated to the concentration of aroma-active compounds derived from GC-O analysis. Prediction models were developed for most aroma descriptors including popcorn, cooked grain, starchy, woody, smoky, grain, corn, hay-like, barny, rancid, waxy, earthy, and sweet aroma using stepwise multiple linear regression. (E,E)-2, 4-decadienal, naphthalene, guaiacol, (E)-2-hexenal, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 2-heptanone contributed most to these sensory attributes.

Many analytical protocols for determining the composition or performance characteristics of biomass involve a drying step, where the drying temperature can vary depending on the specific protocol. To get reliable data, it is important to determine the correct drying temperature to vaporize the water without negatively impacting the compositional quality of the biomass. A comparison of drying temperatures between 45 degrees C and 100 degrees C was performed using wheat straw and corn stover. Near-infrared (NIR) spectra were taken of the dried samples and compared using principal component analysis (PCA). Carbohydrates were analyzed using quantitative saccharification to determine sugar degradation. Analysis of variance was used to determine if there was a significant difference between drying at different temperatures. PCA showed an obvious separation in samples dried at different temperatures due to sample water content. However, quantitative saccharification data shows, within a 95% confidence interval, that there is no significant difference in sugar content for drying temperatures up to 100 degrees C for wheat straw and corn stover.",Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,"['D018533', 'D001709', 'D002241', 'D018547', 'D025341', 'D013055', 'D013696', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Biomass', 'Biotechnology', 'Carbohydrates', 'Plant Stems', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Temperature', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",The effect of drying temperature on the composition of biomass.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19020997,2009

Twenty-four dairy farms were visited twice and samples taken of all diet ingredients. Feed intake data were collected by means of questionnaires. A total of 169 feed samples were collected and analyzed for 20 mycotoxins using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry multimethod. Silage and compound feed were the main diet ingredients, representing on average 67 and 23% of dry matter intake, respectively. Deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid were the mycotoxins with the highest incidence. The incidence of DON in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 38 to 54%. The incidence of zearalenone in silage, compound feed, and feed commodity samples was 17 to 38%. The DON and zearalenone had a low incidence in forage samples and were not detected in ensiled by-product samples. Roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid were only detected in silage and ensiled by-product samples (incidence 7 to 19%). Fumonisins B(1) and B(2) were detected in 2 compound feed samples and one feed commodity sample. Aflatoxins B(1), B(2), G(1), and G(2), ochratoxin A, T-2 and HT-2 toxin, 3-acetyl-DON, 15-acetyl-DON, diacetoxyscirpenol, sterigmatocystin, fusarenon-X, ergotamine, and penicillinic acid were not detected in any of the samples. Average concentrations of DON, zearalenone, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid in complete diets were 273, 28, 114, and 54 microg/kg, respectively. Maximum concentrations were 969, 203, 2,211, and 1,840 microg/kg, respectively. Calculated average daily intakes of these mycotoxins were 5.0, 0.5, 2.0, and 0.9 mg/animal, respectively, and maximum daily intakes 19.3, 3.5, 38.9, and 32.3 mg/animal, respectively. Corn silage was the major source of all 4 of these mycotoxins in the diet. Extremely high concentrations of roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid (up to 45 and 25 mg/kg, respectively) were detected in visibly molded areas in surface layers of corn silage. These areas appeared to be the main source of roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid in the diet. Because carry-over of DON, zearale-none, roquefortine C, and mycophenolic acid into milk is negligible, their occurrence in feedstuffs is not considered of significant concern with respect to the safety of dairy products for consumers.

In this paper, an enrichment experiment with open-top chamber was conducted to examine the effects of elevated CO(2), O(3), and their combination on the contents of total phenolic compounds and flavone in the leaves of spring wheat (C(3) crop) and maize (C(4) crop). The results showed for spring wheat, the total phenolic contents in its leaves at jointing stage was significantly higher under elevated CO(2) and/or O(3), with the sequence of CO(2) plus O(3) > O(3) > CO(2) > ambient, while at grain-filling stage, the total phenolic content was lower under CO(2) plus O(3) than under CO(2), O(3), and ambient. The total phenolic content in maize leaves at jointing stage had the similar variation trend with that for wheat, but at grain-filling stage, the total phenolic content was slightly affected by elevated CO(2) and/or O(3). The flavone content in spring wheat leaves was significantly lower under CO(2) and/or O(3) stress at jointing stage, but had lesser difference at grain-filling stage under the stress. The same variation trend was observed in the flavone content in maize leaves at jointing and grainfilling stages, i.e., CO(2) plus O(3) > CO(2) > ambient > O(3).

18767665,"Concerns have been raised in the scientific community regarding the environmental implications of a dramatic increase in corn-based ethanol production and associated increases in pesticide use. The use of glyphosate, a broad-spectrum herbicide, for corn production has increased considerably in recent years in Canada and the United States. The cost of measuring concentrations of organic contaminants in the environment using traditional wet chemistry methods can be prohibitive; especiallywhen large numbers of samples are required to quantify the spatial and temporal variability in contaminant concentrations. The goal of our study was to evaluate a cost-effective method to measure glyphosate concentrations in surface waters. The reliability of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results was evaluated against liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and linear regression results for 30 water samples from urban watersheds revealed a strong relationship (R2 = 0.88). These results suggest that ELISA methods, used in conjunction with traditional methods, represent a cost-effective approach to enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of a water quality monitoring study. Additionally, we measured a total of 739 surface water samples from over 150 sampling locations throughout Ontario using ELISA from April to October 2007. Concentrations exceeded the method detection limit of 0.1 microg/L in 33% of the samples, with a maximum concentration of 12.0 microg/L.

18654797,"Grass lignins are differentiated from other lignin types by containing relatively large amounts of p-coumaric acid (pCA) acylating the C-9 position of lignin subunits. In the case of a mature corn (Zea mays L.) stems, pCA constitutes 15-18% of a dioxane soluble enzyme lignin. The major portion of the pCA is specifically attached to syringyl residues. Studies with isolated corn wall peroxidases show that pCA readily undergoes radical coupling in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, whereas sinapyl alcohol radical coupling proceeds more slowly. Analysis of corn wall peroxidases did not reveal specific enzymes that would lead to the preferred incorporation of sinapyl alcohol as seen in other plants. The addition of ethyl ferulate, methyl p-coumarate, or sinapyl p-coumarate conjugates to a reaction mixture containing peroxidase, sinapyl alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide stimulated the rate of sinapyl alcohol radical coupling by 10-20-fold. Based on spectral analysis it appears that pCA and ferulate radicals form rapidly, but the radical is readily transferred to sinapyl alcohol. The newly formed sinapyl alcohol radicals undergo coupling and cross-coupling reactions. However, sinapyl alcohol radicals do not cross-couple with pCA radicals. As long as hydrogen peroxide is limiting pCA remains uncoupled. Ferulates have similar reaction patterns in terms of radical transfer though they appear to cross-couple in the reaction mixture more readily then pCA. The role of pCA may be to internally provide a radical transfer mechanism for optimizing radical coupling of sinapyl alcohol into the growing lignin polymer. Attachment of some pCA to sinapyl alcohol ensures localization of the radical transfer mechanism in areas where sinapyl alcohol is being incorporated into lignin.",Planta,"['D002851', 'D003373', 'D005609', 'D008031', 'D008956', 'D010084', 'D010544', 'D010666', 'D010940', 'D018547', 'D011422', 'D003313']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Free Radicals', 'Lignin', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidases', 'Phenylpropionates', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Stems', 'Propionates', 'Zea mays']",A potential role for sinapyl p-coumarate as a radical transfer mechanism in grass lignin formation.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000737', 'Q000302', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18654797,2009

In contrast to immunoaffinity chromatography, in IUF the antibodies are not bound to a solid support material but used in free form, thus making it possible to avoid the critical immobilisation step. Sample clean-up by IUF proved to be as selective as clean-up using commercially available immunoaffinity columns.

The average protein, starch, and oil contents were observed to be 12.28, 64.51, and 3.55%, respectively. High level of heritability estimates were observed for all the traits and ranged from 65.6% (protein content) to 92.5% (alpha/gamma-tocopherol ratio).

18608510,"A monoclonal antibody against zearalenone (ZEA) was produced and used successfully to develop a direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DC-ELISA) for the analysis of ZEA in cereals. This DC-ELISA had a limit of detection of 0.15 +/- 0.02 microg l(-1) and an IC50 value of 1.13 +/- 0.16 microg l(-1). Matrix interference was minimized by dilution of the sample extract before ELISA assays. Aqueous methanol (80%) gave good extraction efficiencies, and the recovery from spiked rice, barley, and corn samples averaged between 87 and 112%. Although ZEA was detected in seven (9%) of 80 rice samples and in eight (16%) of 50 barley samples, the concentration of ZEA in samples was around or below the limit of detection of DC-ELISA. Among 38 corn samples, ZEA was detected in nine (24%) samples in the range 41.0-909.8 microg kg(-1). Re-analysis of the ELISA-positive corn samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed that seven (18%) corn samples were positive. The ZEA results for corn showed very good agreement between DC-ELISA and a commercial AgraQant zearalenone kit (r2 = 0.98). Thus, the monoclonal antibody-based DC-ELISA could be applied to the preliminary screening of ZEA contamination when analysis of a large sample number is needed.","Food additives & contaminants.

18602734,"The toxic potential of nixtamalized foods can be underestimated if, during cooking, reversible fumonisin-food matrix interactions reduce the amount of mycotoxin that is detected but not the amount that is bioavailable. Fusarium verticillioides culture material (CM) was nixtamalized as is (NCM) or after mixing with ground corn (NCMC). Additional portions were sham nixtamalized without (SCM) or with corn (SCMC). Nixtamalization and sham nixtamalization reduced FB(1); CM, NCM, and SCM diets contained 9.08, 2.08, and 1.19 ppm, respectively. FB(1) was further reduced in the NCMC (0.49 ppm) but not the SCMC (1.01 ppm) diets compared to their NCM and SCM counterparts. Equivalent weights of the cooked products, uncooked CM, corn (UC) or nixtamalized UC (NUC) were fed to rats for up to three weeks. Kidney lesions in the NCM-fed group were less severe than in the CM-fed, positive control group and no lesions were found in the NCMC and other groups. Group kidney sphinganine (biomarker of fumonisin exposure) concentrations decreased in the order: CM (absolute concentration (nmol/g)=600-800)>NCM (400-600)>SCM and SCMC (30-90)>NCMC, UC and NUC (<8).

24784536,"The occurrence of mycotoxins in 140 maize silages, 120 grass silages and 30 wheat silages produced in the Netherlands between 2002 and 2004 was determined using a liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS) multi-method. Deoxynivalenol (DON) was detected above the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 250 μg kg⁻¹ in 72% of maize and 10% of wheat silages. Average DON concentrations were 854 and 621 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, and maximum concentrations 3142 and 1165 μg kg⁻¹, respectively. Zearalenone was detected above the LOQ of 25 μg kg⁻¹ in 49% of maize and 6% of grass silages. Average zearalenone concentrations were 174 and 93 μg kg⁻¹, respectively, and maximum concentrations 943 and 308 μg kg⁻¹, respectively. The incidences and average concentrations of DON and zearalenone in maize silage were highest in 2004. The incidence of other mycotoxins was low: fumonisin B1 and 15-acetyl-DON were detected in 1.4 and 5% of maize silages, respectively, and roquefortin C in 0.8% of grass silages. None of the silages contained aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, T2-toxin, HT2-toxin, sterigmatocystin, diacetoxyscirpenol, fusarenon-X, ergotamine, penicillinic acid, or mycophenolic acid. This study demonstrates that maize silage is an important source of DON and zearalenone in the diet of dairy cattle. Since the carryover of these mycotoxins into milk is negligible, their occurrence in feed is not considered to be of significant concern with respect to the safety of dairy products for consumers.

18569005,"Mycotoxins are common dietary contaminants in most regions of the world. The frequency of exposure to the various families of mycotoxins is often dependent on geographic location, national wealth and related agricultural and regulatory infrastructure, combined with diversity of diet and degree of food sufficiency. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a Fusarium mycotoxin that frequently contaminates wheat, corn and barley in temperate regions. A number of acute poisoning incidences have been linked to DON-contaminated foods and chronic exposure to lower levels of DON has been predicted in many regions. DON is a potent animal toxin and exposure in humans may cause gastroenteritis, growth faltering and immune toxicity. An ability to conduct accurate exposure assessment at the individual level is required to fully understand the potential health consequences for humans. To date, such exposure biomarkers have been lacking for many important mycotoxins, including DON. To better assess exposure to DON at the individual level, we have developed a robust urinary assay, incorporating immunoaffinity column (IAC) enrichment and LC-MS detection. Further refinement of this urinary assay, by inclusion of (13)C-DON as an internal standard, was then undertaken and tested within the UK. DON was frequently observed in urine and was significantly associated with cereal intake. A dietary intervention study demonstrated that avoiding wheat in the diet markedly reduced urinary levels of DON. This biomarker requires further validation but our initial data suggest it may provide a useful tool in epidemiological investigations of the potential health consequences of this common environmental toxin.","Food additives & contaminants.

18464095,"This article describes the laboratory assessment of a hand and surface wipe sampling method for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The analytical method employed extraction of the wipe samples into dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) flourometric detection of pyrene, a predominant PAH in used gasoline engine oils (UGEO). Recovery of pyrene was evaluated for two different sampling media by first contaminating the hands of a small number of volunteers with UGEO, followed by applying a small amount of corn oil to the palms, and by wiping the skin with a Whatman cellulostic filter paper or a polyester fabric wipe (i.e., Alpha wipes). In summary, using either Whatman or Alpha wipes, the mean recovery of pyrene from the UGEO that was applied to the hands and contained within three consecutive wipes was 69% and 54%, respectively. However, the relative recovery of the first to second wipe was on average 47% and 75% for the two media, respectively. These results indicate that the Alpha wipes were more efficient at recovering pyrene in the first wipe but less efficient overall when all three consecutive samples were included. Even though this sampling was performed in a controlled laboratory environment, the minimum and maximum amount of pyrene recovered in the individual composite samples using either method spanned a range of twofold. Overall, intra-and interpersonal variability, as measured by coefficient of variation, were 22% and 19%, respectively, and were not statistically different by type of media used.

The oxidative changes in muesli resulting in the formation of secondary oxidation products were evaluated using solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE) to isolate volatiles and GC-MS and chromatography-olfactometry to quantify them and determine the key odorants. During 14 days of storage the total amount of volatile compounds changed from 1.0 mg/kg, in freshly prepared muesli, to 32 mg/kg after storage. The predominant compound was hexanal; its content during storage increased 20-fold, reaching 17 mg/kg.

18328797,"Consumption of sugar beverages has increased among adolescents. Additionally, the replacement of sucrose with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as the predominant sweetener has resulted in higher fructose intake. Few studies have investigated the effect of drinking different sugar-sweetened beverages on bone, despite suggestions that sugar consumption negatively impacts mineral balance. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of drinking different sugar-sweetened beverages on bone mass and strength. Adolescent (age 35d) female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned (n=8-9/group) to consume deionized distilled water (ddH2O, control) or ddH2O containing 13% w/v glucose, sucrose, fructose or high fructose corn syrup (HFCS-55) for 8weeks. Tibia and femur measurements included bone morphometry, bone turnover markers, determination of bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bone strength by three-point bending test. The effect of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption on mineral balance, urinary and fecal calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The results showed no difference in the bone mass or strength of rats drinking the glucose-sweetened beverage despite their having the lowest food intake, but the highest beverage and caloric consumption. Only in comparisons among the rats provided sugar-sweetened beverage were femur and tibia BMD lower in rats drinking the glucose-sweetened beverage. Differences in bone and mineral measurements appeared most pronounced between rats drinking glucose versus fructose-sweetened beverages. Rats provided the glucose-sweetened beverage had reduced femur and tibia total P, reduced P and Ca intake and increased urinary Ca excretion compared to the rats provided the fructose-sweetened beverage. The results suggested that glucose rather than fructose exerted more deleterious effects on mineral balance and bone.",Bone,"['D000284', 'D000818', 'D001628', 'D001696', 'D001835', 'D015519', 'D016723', 'D001842', 'D002118', 'D004040', 'D002149', 'D005260', 'D005269', 'D005632', 'D005947', 'D006706', 'D007668', 'D007677', 'D010758', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D013395', 'D013549', 'D013977']","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Beverages', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Remodeling', 'Bone and Bones', 'Calcium', 'Dietary Carbohydrates', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Femur', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Phosphorus', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sucrose', 'Sweetening Agents', 'Tibia']",The effect of feeding different sugar-sweetened beverages to growing female Sprague-Dawley rats on bone mass and strength.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000008', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000008', 'Q000008', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000008', 'Q000008', 'Q000187']","[None, None, None, None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'administration & dosage', 'drug effects', None, 'drug effects', 'administration & dosage', 'administration & dosage', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'administration & dosage', 'administration & dosage', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18328797,2008

18027188,"Melamine has been used for the adulteration of cereal flours in order to increase their apparent protein content. Crude melamine may contain several by-products, i.e. ammeline, ammelide, and cyanuric acid. The simultaneous analysis of all four chemicals is difficult because of the formation of an insoluble salt between melamine and cyanuric acid. A simple and convenient high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the detection of the adulteration of cereal flours with all four chemicals is proposed herein. The precipitate formation between melamine and cyanuric acid was prevented by using alkaline conditions (pH 11-12) for both standards preparation and sample extraction. The method uses matrix-matching, which involves the construction of a calibration curve on a blank (negative control) matrix, which is then used for the quantitation of melamine and by-products in adulterated (positive) samples. Matrix-matching compensates for analyte losses during sample preparation, and for matrix effects. The method was successfully applied to wheat, corn, and rice flours, and is expected to be applicable (with some modifications) to soy flour as well. The method allows for the detection of melamine, ammeline, and ammelide at approximately 5 microg g(-1), and cyanuric acid at approximately 90 microg g(-1) in wheat flour.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D002851', 'D002523', 'D005433', 'D005506', 'D014227']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Flour', 'Food Contamination', 'Triazines']","High-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous detection of the adulteration of cereal flours with melamine and related triazine by-products ammeline, ammelide, and cyanuric acid.","['Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18027188,2008

Flour dough containing soy flour at 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% was fried in corn oil at 180 degrees C for 2.5 min, and a total of 60 fryings were performed every 30 min. The oxidation of oil was determined by contents of free fatty acids (FFA), conjugated dienoic acids (CDA), polar compounds, and p-anisidine values (PAV). Tocopherols and phospholipids (PLs) in the oil were determined by HPLC. Tocopherols were present in corn oil at 1000 ppm before frying and increased after the first frying of dough containing soy flour due to tocopherol transfer from soy-flour-added dough to the oil during frying. However, as the oil repeated frying, tocopherol contents decreased and its degradation rate was higher in the oil that fried soy-flour-added dough than in the oil that fried the dough without soy flour. PL was not detected in corn oil before and after frying. As the oil repeated frying, FFA, CDA, and polar compounds contents, and PAV of frying oil increased due to the oil oxidation. The values were higher in the oil which fried soy-flour-added dough than in the oil fried the dough without soy flour, indicating the acceleration of oil oxidation by soy flour added to dough. Increase in the oil oxidation by soy flour added to the dough was highly correlated with fast decomposition of tocopherol in the oil.",Journal of food science,"['D002851', 'D003296', 'D003314', 'D004305', 'D005230', 'D005433', 'D005511', 'D006358', 'D010084', 'D010743', 'D013025', 'D013997', 'D024505']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cooking', 'Corn Oil', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified', 'Flour', 'Food Handling', 'Hot Temperature', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phospholipids', 'Soybeans', 'Time Factors', 'Tocopherols']",Oxidation of corn oil during frying of soy-flour-added flour dough.,"['Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","['methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17995672,2007
17995633,"Purple corn (Zea mays L.) is a rich and economic source of anthocyanin colorants and functional ingredients. However, high levels of anthocyanin-rich waste are generated during processing, reducing the yields and increasing the costs of the final product. This waste has been associated with anthocyanin complexation with tannins and proteins. Our objective was to evaluate anthocyanin extraction methods to reduce purple corn waste. Different solvents (water, 0.01%-HCl-acidified water, and 0.01%-HCl-acidified ethanol), temperatures (room temperature, 50, 75, and 100 degrees C), and times of exposure to the solvents were investigated. Acetone (70% acetone in water) extraction was used as control. Anthocyanins, total phenolics, tannins, and proteins in extracts were measured by the pH differential, Folin-Ciocalteu, protein precipitation, and BCA assay methods. Qualitative analyses were done by HPLC coupled to a PDA detector and SDS-PAGE analysis. Water at 50 degrees C achieved the highest yield of anthocyanins (0.94 +/- 0.03 g per 100 g dry corncob) with relatively low tannins and proteins, comparable to the anthocyanin yield obtained by 70% acetone (0.98 +/- 0.08 g per 100 g dry corncob). Extending the extraction time from 20 to 60 min and using consecutive reextraction procedures reduced anthocyanin purity, increasing the yields of other phenolics. A neutral protease was applied to the extracts and effectively decomposed the major protein that was believed to contribute to the development of anthocyanin complexation and waste generation.

17913273,"Mycotoxin contamination in rice is usually lower as in wheat or corn. However, there are some reports that rice has been contaminated with mycotoxins such as aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2 (AFS), citrinin, deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisin B1, B2, B3 (FMS), fusarenon-X (Fus.-X), nivalenol (NIV), ochratoxin A (OTA), sterigmatocystin (STE), and zearalenone. Rice in Japan is preserved in warehouses where moisture content and temperature are regulated. Therefore, mycotoxin contamination from post harvest fungal growth occurs very seldom. Trichothecenes, aflatoxins, and STE in rice were recently analyzed in our laboratory. In 1998, a typhoon struck before rice harvesting in Japan, and the unpolished rice was found to be stained brown. Samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of trichothecenes. Mycotoxins DON, Fus.-X, and NIV were detected and confirmed with GC-MS. The quantity of trichothecenes was determined using GC-ECD. STE is a carcinogenic mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus versicolor and some other fungi. STE contamination of rice was studied in our laboratory since 1973. GC-MS, LC-MS, LC-MS/MS, and LC-UV methods for STE determination were examined, giving good results for the LC-UV method using a photo diode array detector. Different techniques for the extraction of STE from rice were also studied. Finally, brown rice was ground, and the ground rice was extracted with acetonitrile-water. An Autoprep MF-A 1000 column was used to clean up AFS and STE. The cleaned-up extract was analyzed with HPLC-UV. Forty-eight brown rice samples were analyzed, and none of them were contaminated with STE. These rice samples were also analyzed for AFS and FMS, and none of the samples were contaminated.

The method, using liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-APCI-MS/MS), allowed unambiguous identification of the selected trichothecenes at low microg per kg levels in such complex food matrices. A clean-up procedure, based on reversed phase SPE Oasis HLB columns, was used, allowing good recoveries for all studied trichothecenes. In particular, NIV recoveries significantly improved compared to those obtained by using Mycosep #227 columns for clean-up of the extracts. Limits of detection in the various investigated matrices ranged 2.5-4.0 microg kg(-1) for NIV, 2.8-5.3 microg kg(-1) for DON, 0.4-1.7 microg kg(-1) for HT-2 and 0.4-1.0 microg kg(-1) for T-2. Mean recovery values, obtained from cereals and cereal products spiked with NIV, DON, HT-2 and T-2 toxins at levels from 10 to 1000 microg kg(-1), ranged from 72 to 110% with mean relative standard deviation lower than 10%. A systematic investigation of matrix effects in different cereals and cereal products was also carried out by statistically comparing the slopes of standard calibration curve with matrix-matched calibration curve for each of the four toxins and the eight matrices tested.

Of the analysed jarred baby food products those containing only meat and starch from rice and corn had low levels of furan. In addition, the fruit products showed similar low levels. Clearly higher concentrations were found in the vegetable and vegetable-meat products. For the adult population coffee seems to be an important product with respect to furan intake.

High-performance liquid chromatography has become the method of choice for the determination of these phytochemicals. A crucial step prior to the chromatographic separation is the quantitative extraction from the food matrix which was proven to be impeded in durum wheat. To optimize the extraction procedure, several factors with influence on extractability of carotenoids were investigated. Finally, it was shown that soaking of samples in water for 5 min prior to extraction with organic solvents had the strongest impact on extraction yield and led to the most rapid and gentle method. Contents of carotenoids in the extracts of several durum wheat and corn samples were doubled by soaking in water before extracting with methanol/tetrahydrofuran (1/1, v/v).

The inherent difficulty in accurately determining the true aflatoxin concentration of a lot of corn may have serious implications. Deviations from the true value are of even greater significance at busy locations where a high throughput is desired. This study was instituted to measure (1) the differences in aflatoxin test results between elevator laboratories and the Louisiana Agricultural Chemistry (LAC) laboratory and (2) the variability in aflatoxin test results associated with sampling, sample preparation, and analysis of shelled corn at such locations. One hundred lots of shelled corn from 10 elevators in Louisiana were analyzed for aflatoxin using the Aflatest method (at elevators and at the LAC laboratory) and high-performance column liquid chromatography (HPLC; LAC laboratory only). Mean aflatoxin levels determined at elevator laboratories were significantly (P < 0.05) lower from those obtained in the LAC laboratory using the Aflatest method. Overall, Aflatest method results were lower than those obtained by HPLC. This difference may be attributed to analyst technical dexterity, difficulty in providing careful attention to detail in a high throughput environment, and/or substandard facilities found at elevators.

The presence of difructose anhydrides (DFAs) in these syrups is described for the first time in this paper; their proportions were dependent on the syrup type considered. As these compounds were not detected in any of the 20 honey samples analyzed, their presence in honey is proposed as a marker of adulteration. Detection of honey adulteration with HFCS and IS requires a previous enrichment step to remove major sugars (monosaccharides) and to preconcentrate DFAs.

The only data required for this method are the results obtained from an analysis of the lipid fraction by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total number of 566 samples (pure oils and samples of adulterated olive oil) were used to develop the chemometric models, which were designed to accomplish, step-by-step, the three aims of the method: to detect whether an olive oil sample is adulterated, to identify the type of adulterant used in the fraud, and to determine how much aldulterant is in the sample. Qualitative analysis was carried out via two chemometric approaches--soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) and K nearest neighbours (KNN)--both approaches exhibited prediction abilities that were always higher than 91% for adulterant detection and 88% for type of adulterant identification. Quantitative analysis was based on partial least squares regression (PLSR), which yielded R2 values of >0.90 for calibration and validation sets and thus made it possible to determine adulteration with excellent precision according to the Shenk criteria.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002845', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D000069463', 'D010938']","['Chromatography', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils']","Sequential (step-by-step) detection, identification and quantitation of extra virgin olive oil adulteration by chemometric treatment of chromatographic profiles.","['Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","['methods', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17611742,2007

Transgenic corns and its parents were studied by ICP-MS to detect the heavy metals. The results showed that the transgenic corn accumulated less heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Cd, As, Cr, Zn and Hg) than their own parents; and the contents of some heavy metals (V, Co and Pb) in transgenic corns were similar to their parents. All the data showed that the insertion of foreign gene (Bt) might change the absorbing dynamics of most heavy metals, especially some important heavy metals, which are disadvantageous to human health.

No adequate methods are available to detect such contamination in commercial coffee. A new method, based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tocopherol determination was developed to detect coffee adulteration by corn. Percentages of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol determined by HPLC in six coffee varieties were 29.0, 61.7, 3.3, and 6.0, respectively. Similar values were obtained in six popular coffee brands. The percentages of alpha-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol in six corn samples were 3.6, 91.3, and 5.1, respectively. These differences could be applied to detect corn in a pure coffee sample intentionally contaminated with corn with the best result obtained with gamma-tocopherol.

A test portion was extracted with methanol-water (80 + 20); the extract was filtered, diluted with phosphate-buffered saline solution, filtered on a microfiber glass filter, and applied to an immunoaffinity column. The column was washed with deionized water to remove interfering compounds, and the purified aflatoxin B1 was eluted with methanol. Aflatoxin B1 was separated and determined by reversed-phase LC with fluorescence detection after either pre- or postcolumn derivatization. Precolumn derivatization was achieved by generating the trifluoroacetic acid derivative, used by 8 laboratories. The postcolumn derivatization was achieved either with pyridinium hydrobromide perbromide, used by 16 laboratories, or with an electrochemical cell by the addition of bromide to the mobile phase, used by 5 laboratories. The derivatization techniques used were not significantly different when compared by the Student's t-test; the method was statistically evaluated for all the laboratories. Five corn sample materials, both spiked and naturally contaminated, were sent to 29 laboratories (22 Italian and 7 European). Test portions were spiked with aflatoxin B1 at levels of 2.00 and 5.00 ng/g. The mean values for recovery were 82% for the low level and 84% for the high contamination level.

Starch (corn and wheat) subjected to an alkaline-microwave dissolution scheme (35 s microwave heating in a mixture of 6 M urea and 1 M KOH) was either treated with ion-exchange resin or passed through a desalting column to remove salt/urea contaminants. Control (untreated) starch solution analyzed by IPSEC displayed a significant interfering peak (attributable to salt/urea), which coeluted with the starch amylose peak. The interfering peak was most efficiently eliminated by first passing the starch solution through a desalting column, which process effectively removed impurities (e.g., salts/urea) without appearing to adversely impact the starch structural analysis.

We synthesized and purified DONGLU and tested its immunotoxicity, hypothesizing that DONGLU would be much less toxic to K562 cells compared with DON. DONGLU was synthesized using rat liver microsomes, uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid and DON, and purified with a Sephadex LH-20 column and reverse phase HPLC. beta-Glucuronidase hydrolysis formed a product with retention time and UV spectrum identical with DON. Using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in negative mode, the molecular mass (M-1) of purified DONGLU was 471 g/mol; in agreement with an expected molecular weight of 472 g/mol. MS and NMR indicated that the glucuronide moiety was conjugated with the carbon-3-hydroxyl group of DON.

17337530,"Based on the ability of phytosiderophores to chelate other heavy metals besides iron (Fe), phytosiderophores were suggested to prevent graminaceous plants from cadmium (Cd) toxicity. To assess interactions between Cd and phytosiderophore-mediated Fe acquisition, maize (Zea mays) plants were grown hydroponically under limiting Fe supply. Exposure to Cd decreased uptake rates of 59Fe(III)-phytosiderophores and enhanced the expression of the Fe-phytosiderophore transporter gene ZmYS1 in roots as well as the release of the phytosiderophore 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) from roots under Fe deficiency. However, DMA hardly mobilized Cd from soil or from a Cd-loaded resin in comparison to the synthetic chelators diaminetriaminepentaacetic acid and HEDTA. While nano-electrospray-high resolution mass spectrometry revealed the formation of an intact Cd(II)-DMA complex in aqueous solutions, competition studies with Fe(III) and zinc(II) showed that the formed Cd(II)-DMA complex was weak. Unlike HEDTA, DMA did not protect yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells from Cd toxicity but improved yeast growth in the presence of Cd when yeast cells expressed ZmYS1. When supplied with Fe-DMA as a Fe source, transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants expressing a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-ZmYS1 gene construct showed less growth depression than wild-type plants in response to Cd. These results indicate that inhibition of ZmYS1-mediated Fe-DMA transport by Cd is not related to Cd-DMA complex formation and that Cd-induced phytosiderophore release cannot protect maize plants from Cd toxicity. Instead, phytosiderophore-mediated Fe acquisition can improve Fe uptake in the presence of Cd and thereby provides an advantage under Cd stress relative to Fe acquisition via ferrous Fe.",Plant physiology,"['D000222', 'D002104', 'D017343', 'D007501', 'D008969', 'D017262', 'D021241', 'D017550', 'D003313']","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Cadmium', 'Genes, Plant', 'Iron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Siderophores', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Zea mays']",Iron acquisition by phytosiderophores contributes to cadmium tolerance.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000235']","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17337530,2007

17292466,"Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of maize and wheat NADP-malic enzyme by KI and acrylamide was studied after denaturating proteins with guanidine hydrochloride, and subjecting them to different pH values or temperatures. Protein unfolding by guanidine hydrochloride resulted in a red shift of the fluorescence spectrum, providing further support for the motion that several of the tryptophan residues evolved from an apolar to a polar environment. Protein denaturation was accompanied by an increase in the effective dynamic quenching constant values and by loss of the enzyme's activities. Thermal denaturation gave results consistent with the ones observed for chemical denaturation suggesting that a putative intermediate is involved in the denaturation process. Finally, exposure of both enzymes at various pH values allowed us to infer the number of accessible tryptophan residues in the different oligomeric conformations. The results suggest that the aggregation process seems to be different for each enzyme. Thus, as the maize enzyme associated from monomer to tetramer, one tryptophan residue would change from a polar to an apolar environment, while the association of the wheat enzyme would cause that two tryptophan residues to be excluded from quenching. Hitherto, quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence provides a good tool for studying conformational changes of proteins.

Molds were identified to genus, and those belonging to the genus Fusarium were identified to species. Twenty isolates of Fusarium verticillioides were tested with a high-performance liquid chromatography-naphthalene dicarboxaldehyde-fluorescence method for their ability to produce fumonisins B1 and B2. The internal fungal infection in organic maize (63.20%) was significantly higher than that in conventional maize (40.27%) (P < 0.05). However, the distribution of fungal genera indicated a significantly higher prevalence of Fusarium in conventional (34.93%) than in organic (18.15%) maize, making Fusarium the predominant fungus in conventional maize. This difference in mold distribution between organic and conventional maize was attributed to the difference in cultivation system.

After the addition of the internal standard AFM1, the final extract was analyzed by LC/ESI-MS/MS in positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring with a triple-quadrupole instrument. A C(18) column thermostatted at 45 degrees C with a mobile phase gradient of acetonitrile/water with 2 mmol/L ammonium formate was used.

17194553,"The present study investigated the protective effects of zinc in attenuating the altered activities of drug metabolizing enzymes in the livers of rats intoxicated with chlorpyrifos. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received oral chlorpyrifos treatment (at a dose level of 13.5 mg/kg body weight in corn oil every alternate day), zinc supplementation alone (at a dose level of 227 mg/l in drinking water), or combined chlorpyrifos plus zinc treatments for a total duration of 8 weeks. The effects of different treatments were studied on the specific activities of various drug metabolizing enzymes including cytochrome P(450), cytochrome b(5), NADPH cytochrome-c-reductase, NADH cytochrome-c-reductase, aminopyrene-N-demethylase (APD) and aromatic hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH). Additionally, serum zinc levels were also determined in each of the treatment groups at the end of the study. Chlorpyrifos treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the serum zinc concentrations. Analogous to these changes, we observed significant depression in the activities of majority of the drug metabolizing enzymes investigated in the present study, except for AHH, where the decrease in enzyme activity was not statistically significant. However, zinc treatment to chlorpyrifos treated animals effectively restored the depressed serum zinc levels to within normal limits. Similarly, co-administration of zinc to chlorpyrifos intoxicated animals normalized the enzymatic activities of cytochrome P(450), NADPH cytochrome-c-reductase and NADH cytochrome-c-reductase within normal range.

Although several traditional methods have been developed to detect moniliformin, the lack of anti-moniliformin antibodies has created a need for materials that recognize moniliformin at the molecular level through a binding mechanism. To address this issue, the authors synthesized molecularly imprinted polymers that bind moniliformin. Imprinted and non-imprinted polymers were evaluated by equilibrium binding assays and moniliformin concentrations were measured by LC analysis using ultraviolet light detection. Successful polymers were imprinted with toxin analogues as the templates; non-imprinted polymers exhibited minimal binding in acetonitrile under the assay conditions. Selected imprinted polymers also bound moniliformin in ethanol, methanol and dimethyl formamide. Significant differences in moniliformin binding by the polymers were dependent on polymer composition, and these differences were highly dependent on the template used to imprint the polymer. Polymers were further evaluated as sorbents for molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE), and an imprinted polymer was used for preconcentration and clean-up of a moniliformin spiked corn extract.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D002853', 'D003503', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D007202', 'D009183', 'D011108']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cyclobutanes', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Mycotoxins', 'Polymers']",Synthesis and evaluation of molecularly imprinted polymers as sorbents of moniliformin.,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['methods', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17164216,2007

The 39 analytes included A- and B-trichothecenes (including deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside), zearalenone and related derivatives, fumonisins, enniatins, ergot alkaloids, ochratoxins, aflatoxins and moniliformin. The large number and the chemical diversity of the analytes required the application of the positive as well as the negative ion ESI mode in two consecutive chromatographic runs of 21 min each. The solvent mixture acetonitrile/water/acetic acid 79 + 20 + 1 (v/v/v) has been determined as the best compromise for the extraction of the analytes from wheat and maize. Raw extracts were diluted 1 + 1 and were injected without any clean-up. Ion-suppression effects due to co-eluting matrix components were negligible in the case of wheat, whereas significant signal suppression for 12 analytes was observed in maize, causing purely proportional systematic errors. Method performance characteristics were determined after spiking blank samples on multiple levels in triplicate. Coefficients of variation of the overall process of <5.1% and <3.0% were obtained for wheat and maize, respectively, from linear calibration data. Limits of detection ranged from 0.03 to 220 microg/kg. Apparent recoveries (including both the recoveries of the extraction step and matrix effects) were within the range of 100 +/- 10% for approximately half of the analytes. In extreme cases the apparent recoveries dropped to about 20%, but this could be compensated for to a large extent by the application of matrix-matched standards to correct for matrix-induced signal suppression, as only a few analytes such as nivalenol and the fumonisins exhibited incomplete extraction. For deoxynivalenol and zearalenone, the trueness of the method was confirmed through the analysis of certified reference materials.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D002851', 'D009183', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D021241', 'D053719', 'D014255', 'D014908', 'D003313', 'D015025']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Mycotoxins', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Trichothecenes', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays', 'Zearalenone']",Development and validation of a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method for the determination of 39 mycotoxins in wheat and maize.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000295', 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'instrumentation', 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16912987,2007

Addition of chicken liver, followed by egg yolk, resulted in the greatest increases in iron and zinc content for both the rice- and maize-based complementary foods, whereas addition of small dried fish with bones had the greatest effect on calcium. The IP5 + IP6 content and [Phy]/[Zn] molar ratios were higher in the maize- than rice-based complementary foods, and were reduced by soaking, although only the maize plus mung bean grits, with and without soaking, had [Phy]/[Zn] molar ratios above 15.

The results showed remarkable differences in the binding specificity of LAK-mimetic adsorbents for a wide range of proteins, as a consequence of minor changes in ligand structure.

Paired comparisons, using the same sample extract, were also made between the PHRED and one of the other 2 methods, among laboratories in 4 different countries, on a variety of naturally contaminated commodity products. The differences between the techniques were not significant for peanuts, but for corn the photochemical system consistently gave slightly higher values for aflatoxins B1 and B2 than the Kobra cell method. However, a comparison of all sample results showed no significant differences between methods.

Currently there are few data on the metabolism of 2-ACBs, which makes it very important to study this aspect of 2-ACBs to evaluate their safety. The objectives of this experiment were to quantify 2-dodecylcyclobutanone (2-DCB; formed from palmitic acid) in the feces and adipose tissue of rats and to check for metabolites of 2-DCB in the urine. Six female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 2-DCB (5 mg/day) in corn oil for 5 days via gavage. Six control rats did not receive 2-DCB. Feces and urine were collected daily, whereas adipose tissue was collected upon euthanasia. Hexane extracts of feces and adipose tissue were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Urine with and without added beta-glucuronidase was monitored for glucuronide complexes by hexane extraction and GC-MS. The total amount of 2-DCB recovered in feces was 1.78 +/- 0.63 mg at the end of 5 days, which represents between 3 and 11% of the total 2-DCB administered.

This leads to a larger intake and retention of lipophilic toxic chemicals in the body with an increase in risks to human health. The objective of this study was to characterize the effect of dietary fat on disposition and metabolism of fluoranthene (FLA), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compound. FLA was administered to F-344 rats in monounsaturated (peanut oil), polyunsaturated (corn oil) and saturated (coconut oil) fats at doses of 50 and 100 microg/kg via oral gavage. Blood, small intestine, liver, lung, testis, adipose tissue, urine and feces were collected at various time points' post-FLA exposure. Samples were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for FLA parent compound and metabolites. DNA was isolated from the tissues and subjected to (32)P-post labeling to measure FLA-DNA adducts. The concentrations of unchanged FLA (FLA parent compound) and its metabolites showed an increase for the saturated fat treatment group compared with mono- and polyunsaturated fat groups. The FLA-DNA adduct concentrations were high in tissues of rats that received FLA through saturated fat. The toxicokinetic parameters, concentrations of FLA metabolites and FLA-DNA adduct showed a dose-dependent increase, and this increase was statistically significant (P<.05) for saturated fat. These findings clearly demonstrate that the high residence time of FLA parent compound in saturated fat allows extensive metabolism, contributing reactive metabolites of FLA that bind with DNA and causing marked damage in a long-term exposure scenario.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,"['D000818', 'D018736', 'D004041', 'D004042', 'D005449', 'D007583', 'D008099', 'D008168', 'D008297', 'D051381', 'D011916', 'D013737', 'D014018']","['Animals', 'DNA Adducts', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Fluorenes', 'Jejunum', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Testis', 'Tissue Distribution']",Effect of dietary fat on metabolism and DNA adduct formation after acute oral exposure of F-344 rats to fluoranthene.,"[None, 'Q000096', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000187', None]","[None, 'biosynthesis', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'drug effects', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16781860,2007

Fumonisin concentrations and potential toxicity could be underestimated, however, if unknown but biologically active fumonisins are present. Therefore, the relative amounts of fumonisins in extracts of fumonisin-contaminated corn and its masa and tortilla chip nixtamalization products were determined with an in vitro ceramide synthase inhibition bioassay using increased sphinganine (Sa) and sphinganine to sphingosine ratio (Sa/So) as endpoints. African green monkey kidney cells (Vero cells ATCC CCL-81) were grown in 1-ml wells and exposed to 4 microl of the concentrated extracts for 48 h. The corn extract inhibited ceramide synthase as Sa (mean = 132 pmol/well) and Sa/So (mean = 2.24) were high compared to vehicle controls (Sa = 9 pmol/well; Sa/So = 0.10). Inhibitory activity (mean Sa = 14-24 pmol/well; mean Sa/So = 0.17-0.28) of the masa and tortilla chip extracts were reduced > or = 80% compared to the corn extract. Results were corroborated in a second experiment in which Sa and Sa/So of the wells treated with masa or tortilla chip extracts were reduced > or = 89% compared to those treated with the corn extract. Masa and tortilla chip FB1 concentrations (4-7 ppm) were reduced about 80-90% compared to the corn (30 ppm) when the materials were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Therefore, nixtamalization reduced both the measured amount of FB1 and the ceramide synthase inhibitory activity of masa and tortilla chips extracts.

16541407,"The recently introduced technique of an atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) source coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QqTOFMS) has been applied to fast olive oil fingerprinting on the basis of the accurate mass measurements obtained with this instrumentation. The key compounds can be characterized as [M+H]+ (produced by proton transfer) or as [M]+* (by charge transfer) ions in the mass spectra. [M+H]+ ions, however, show higher abundance, especially for triacylglycerols. Other ions present in APPI-MS are the acylium ion [RiCO]+ and [RiCO-H2O]+. This latter ion is absent in the electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS spectra, and this represents valuable complementary information. Several critical parameters in the APPI source were optimized such as LC eluent composition, ion spray voltage and, especially, declustering potential. APPI-QqTOFMS allows easy discrimination among different edible oils: olive, extra virgin olive, olive-pomace, hazelnut, sunflower, corn and several mixed oils, with high throughput (approximately 1 min per sample). Cluster analysis was applied to obtain the best experimental conditions for oil discrimination on the basis of declustering potential.

Increasing demand in agricultural science for knowledge of specific traits in kernels is driving the need to find high-throughput methods of examination. In this study macroscopic near-infrared (NIR) reflectance hyperspectral imaging was used to measure small sets of kernels in the spectroscopic range of 950 nm to 1700 nm. Image analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to determine kernel germ from endosperm regions as well as to define individual kernels as objects out of sets of kernels. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to predict oil or oleic acid concentrations derived from germ or full kernel spectra. The relative precision of the minimum cross-validated root mean square error (RMSECV) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for oil and oleic acid concentration were compared for two sets of two hundred kernels.

Pigments were extracted from four native maize varieties (Arrocillo, Peruano, Purepecha and Cónico), which possess a high anthocyanin concentration in the pericarp. Pericarp and aleurone layer were mechanicallly removed from grain using a Strong-Scott barley pearled. Yields of pericarp and aleurone layer fraction (PALF) were evaluated. Total anthocyanin content in this fraction was determined by a conventional spectrophotometric method and the anthocyanin profile was obtained by HPLC. One mg of anthocyanin extracts from the PALF was added to 100 g of a commercial plain yogurt. Yogurt samples were kept under refrigerated conditions and color and pH were monitored every 5 days interval, during three weeks. The yields of PALF were 48.4%, 55.1%, 40.2%, and 40.0% for Arrocillo, Peruano, Cónico and Purepecha varieties, respectivelly. The highest total anthocyanin content (259.4 mg of anthocyanins/100 g sample) was observed in Peruano PALF. The color of yogurts dyed with each of the four extracts was different. Yogurts dyed with Peruano and Arrocillo extracts showed a more intense reddish tone than those dyed with Cónico and Purepecha.

16428640,"Based on the potential benefits of cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) for human health, there is a need to develop effective strategies for enhancing milk fat CLA concentrations. Levels of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk can be increased by supplements of fish oil (FO) and sunflower oil (SO), but there is considerable variation in the response. Part of this variance may reflect time-dependent ruminal adaptations to high levels of lipid in the diet, which lead to alterations in the formation of specific biohydrogenation intermediates. To test this hypothesis, 16 late lactation Holstein-British Friesian cows were used in a repeated measures randomized block design to examine milk fatty acid composition responses to FO and SO in the diet over a 28-d period. Cows were allocated at random to corn silage-based rations (8 per treatment) containing 0 (control) or 45 g of oil supplement/kg of dry matter consisting (1:2; wt/wt) of FO and SO (FSO), and milk composition was determined on alternate days from d 1. Compared with the control, the FSO diet decreased mean dry matter intake (21.1 vs. 17.9 kg/d), milk fat (47.7 vs. 32.6 g/kg), and protein content (36.1 vs. 33.3 g/kg), but had no effect on milk yield (27.1 vs. 26.4 kg/d). Reductions in milk fat content relative to the FSO diet were associated with increases in milk trans-10 18:1, trans-10, cis-12 CLA, and trans-9, cis-11 CLA concentrations (r(2) = 0.74, 0.57, and 0.80, respectively). Compared with the control, the FSO diet reduced milk 4:0 to 18:0 and cis 18:1 content and increased trans 18:1, trans 18:2, cis-9, trans-11 CLA, 20:5 n-3, and 22:6 n-3 concentrations. The FSO diet caused a rapid elevation in milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, reaching a maximum of 5.37 g/100 g of fatty acids on d 5, but these increases were transient, declining to 2.35 g/100 g of fatty acids by d 15. They remained relatively constant thereafter. Even though concentrations of trans-11 18:1 followed the same pattern of temporal changes as cis-9, trans-11 CLA, the total trans 18:1 content of FSO milk was unchanged because of the concomitant increases in the concentration of other isomers (Delta(4-10) and Delta(12-15)), predominantely trans-10 18:1. In conclusion, supplementing diets with FSO enhances milk fat cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, but the high level of enrichment declines because of changes in ruminal biohydrogenation that result in trans-10 replacing trans-11 as the major 18:1 biohydrogenation intermediate formed in the rumen.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000824', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D004032', 'D005223', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D005395', 'D008401', 'D006865', 'D044243', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D010938', 'D012417', 'D012820', 'D000074242', 'D003313']","['Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Diet', 'Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Fish Oils', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrogenation', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Plant Oils', 'Rumen', 'Silage', 'Sunflower Oil', 'Zea mays']",Examination of the persistency of milk fatty acid composition responses to fish oil and sunflower oil in the diet of dairy cows.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000008', 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428640,2006

The blast results for ROMT-9 showed a 73% identity with caffeic acid OMTs from maize and Triticum aestivum. ROMT-9 was expressed in Escherichia coli and its recombinant protein was purified using affinity chromatography. It was then tested for its ability to transfer the methyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine to the flavonoid substrates, eriodictyol, luteolin, quercetin, and taxifolin, all of which have a 3'-hydroxyl functional group. The reaction products were analyzed using TLC, HPLC, HPLC/MS, and NMR spectroscopy. The NMR analysis showed that ROMT-9 transferred the methyl group specifically to the 3'-hydroxyl group of quercetin, resulting in the formation of its methoxy derivative. Furthermore, ROMT-9 converted flavonoids containing the 3'-hydroxy functional group such as eriodictyol, luteolin, quercetin and taxifolin into the corresponding methoxy derivatives, suggesting that ROMT-9 is an OMT with strict specificity for the 3'-hydroxy group of flavonoids.",Phytochemistry,"['D000595', 'D002109', 'D003001', 'D018076', 'D004926', 'D044950', 'D005419', 'D044948', 'D005786', 'D047311', 'D008969', 'D012275', 'D011497', 'D011794', 'D011994', 'D012436', 'D013379', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Caffeic Acids', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Escherichia coli', 'Flavanones', 'Flavonoids', 'Flavonols', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Luteolin', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oryza', 'Protein O-Methyltransferase', 'Quercetin', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']","Flavonoid 3'-O-methyltransferase from rice: cDNA cloning, characterization and functional expression.","[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000031', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analogs & derivatives', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16412485,2006

Using ionic alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Et3N-alpha-CHCA) as the matrix, matrix-free mass spectra in the m/z range of interest are acquired, and the B1, B2, G1, and G2 aflatoxins are readily detected with an LOD as low as 50 fmol. The technique is fast, requires little sample preparation and no derivatization or chromatographic separation, and seems therefore to be suitable for high-throughput aflatoxin screening.

The natural occurrence of fumonisins has been verified in maize and a large range of maize-based products in many countries of the world. However, occasional reports have emerged of fumonisins being detected in wheat, despite the main producing fungi not being pathogens of this cereal. An investigation was conducted into a recent report of the natural occurrence of fumonisins in the 2003/2004 South African wheat crop at levels up to 1.7 mg/kg, as determined by immunoaffinity column cleanup and direct fluorometric measurement. An AOAC International high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of fumonisins in maize was modified and validated for the determination of fumonisins in spiked wheat samples. HPLC analysis of the wheat samples previously found to be positive for fumonisins revealed no detectable (<5 microg/kg) fumonisins in the 30 samples analyzed. These results, which lay doubt on previous reports of fumonisins in wheat, emphasize the fact that screening methods, especially if used outside their range or matrix of applicability, can produce false positive results despite the use of immunoaffinity cleanup.

The novel feature of this method is that the sample purification is carried out as a part of the assay, and a separate sample cleanup step is not required. The assay procedure involves the sequential addition of standard or sample, cleaning solutions, and aflatoxin B1-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (AFB1-HRP) over antibody-spotted zones of a membrane, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate for visualization. We have determined that trifluoroacetic acid and propionic acids at concentrations of 100 mM are highly effective for cleaning groundnut, wheat, corn, and poultry feed samples and that NaHCO3 (100 mM) is successful in cleaning processed soybean. In all cases, subsequent washing was performed with phosphate-buffered saline solution to facilitate the removal of traces of adhering interfering substances. A batch of 12 samples can be analyzed within 8 min either by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards or, more precisely, by densitometry. The method was tested for the analysis of AFB1 in groundnut, wheat, corn, processed soybean, chili, and poultry feed. The detection limit obtained was 5 microg/kg, except for chili, where it was 10 microg/kg. The average recoveries from different noninfected food samples spiked with AFB1 at concentrations of 5 to 100 microg/kg were between 99 and 105%. The values obtained for infected corn and groundnut samples correlated well with the estimates obtained by high-pressure liquid chromatography.

16027206,"Heavy metals such as zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) are potential bioaccumulative toxins of the dairy production system. The heavy metal content of dairy feeds, however, remains poorly documented, particularly in the United States. This survey determined the heavy metal content of 203 typical dairy ration components sampled from 54 dairy farms in Wisconsin. Lowest heavy metal concentrations were found in homegrown alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay and haylage, and corn (Zea mays L.) grain and silage. Highest metal concentrations were found in purchased feeds, particularly mineral supplements, and to a lesser extent corn- or soybean-based concentrates. Zinc and Cu were found at the highest concentration in complete dairy (total mixed and aggregated component) rations and reflected the deliberate addition of these metals to meet animal nutrient requirements although more than half the farms fed Cu and Zn above US recommended levels. Concentrations of Cr, As, Cd, and Pb were present in much lower concentrations and decreased in the order Cr > As > Pb > Cd. No complete Wisconsin dairy ration contained heavy metal concentrations above US maximum acceptable concentrations and would be unlikely to induce any toxic effects in dairy cattle. Concentrations of Cd in complete dairy rations were closest to US maximum acceptable concentrations, suggesting the greatest potential long-term risk to exceed US maximum acceptable concentrations if whole farm levels of Cd were to increase in the future. With the exception of Pb, the main sources of Zn, Cu, Cr, As, and Cd in the complete dairy feed ration originated from imported feed. The continued importation of heavy metals in dairy feed is likely to be associated with accumulation of these metals in soils where manure is applied. Although the cycling of many heavy metals through the dairy food chain will be limited by factors such as a soil's cation exchange capacity, pH, salinity, and phytotoxicity of the metal, these may be less limiting for Cd. It is important that sources of Cd in the dairy system are identified and minimized to prevent problems associated with Cd accumulation in the dairy soil system arising over the long-term.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000821', 'D000818', 'D001151', 'D002104', 'D002417', 'D002857', 'D003300', 'D003612', 'D004032', 'D005260', 'D007774', 'D007854', 'D013058', 'D000455', 'D019216', 'D012820', 'D013053', 'D014922', 'D003313', 'D015032']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Cadmium', 'Cattle', 'Chromium', 'Copper', 'Dairying', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Lactation', 'Lead', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Medicago sativa', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Silage', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Wisconsin', 'Zea mays', 'Zinc']",A survey of selected heavy metal concentrations in Wisconsin dairy feeds.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16027206,2006

15969091,"Cystatin, which widely distributed in both tissues and body fluids of animal and plant, was a superfamily of cysteine proteinase inhibitors. It could form activity-inhibitor complexes with cysteine proteinases to inhibit the hydrolytic activity of proteinases. Cystatin played important roles not only in the inhibition of the proteolytic degradation of fish muscle, but also in biological defense systems against invaders. To explore the functions of fish cystatin and the potential values in fish disease prevention and cure, as well as seafood processing, the recombinant yeast strains which could express Chinese sturgeon cystatin were constructed. First, the cystatin cDNA of Chinese sturgeon, which had been PCR modified, was subcloned into yeast integrated vector pPICZaA. After extracted and purified, the recombinant plasmids were linearized by Sac I. The yeast Pichia pastoris GS115 strain was transformed by use of the Lithium Chloride transformation method, and the recombinant cystatin yeast strains got. After 0.5% methanol induction, SDS-PAGE analysis of the culture supernatant indicated that the yield of recombinant cystatin was about 215mg x L(-1) with the percentage about 73.6%. The recombinant cystatin was purified through Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography, and the purity reached about 94.2%. The inhibitory activity of recombinant cystatin was measured by inhibiting the proteinase activity of papain. The results showed that about 1 microg recombinant cystatin could inhibit the activity of 15 microg papain. Heat stability assay results showed that there was a decrease in inhibitory activity of cystatin with the increasing of temperature. When solution of recombinant cystatin was kept at 70 degrees C for 5min, the inhibitory activity reduced fast. While the recombinant cystatin was heated to 90 degrees C for 5min, the inhibitory activity of recombinant cystatin was undetected. The inhibitory activity for recombinant Chinese sturgeon cystatin was higher than that of CPI (cysteine proteinase inhibitor) from seeds of corn, that about 1 microg purified CIP could inhibited the activity of 0.278 microg papain. But the heat stability of recombinant cystatin is lower than that of the corn CPI. The expression level and the activity of recombinant cystatin from yeast Pichia pastoris were higher than those from E. coli. Moreover, recombinant cystatin from Pichia pastoris was easier to separate and purify. This paper reported that recombinant fish cystatin was produced in a highly efficient expression system based on the methylotrophic yeast, further work will focus on the function of recombinant Chinese sturgeon cystatin to resist fish disease and explore the value of cystatin as a food additive to inhibit cysteine proteinases during surimi processing.",Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,"['D000818', 'D015891', 'D015853', 'D004789', 'D029941', 'D010843', 'D016133', 'D055550', 'D013696']","['Animals', 'Cystatins', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fish Proteins', 'Pichia', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Stability', 'Temperature']",[Expression of Chinese sturgeon cystatin in yeast Pichia pastoris and its proteinase inhibitory activity analysis].,"[None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000187', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, None]","[None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'drug effects', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15969091,2010

15954725,"Using uncertainty associated with detection of aflatoxin in shelled corn as a model, the uncertainty associated with detecting chemical agents intentionally added to food products was evaluated. Accuracy and precision are two types of uncertainties generally associated with sampling plans. Sources of variability that affect precision were the primary focus of this investigation. Test procedures used to detect chemical agents generally include sampling, sample preparation, and analytical steps. The uncertainty of each step contributes to the total uncertainty of the test procedure. Using variance as a statistical measure of uncertainty, the variance associated with each step of the test procedure used to detect aflatoxin in shelled corn was determined for both low and high levels of contamination. For example, when using a 1-kg sample, Romer mill, 50-g subsample, and high-performance liquid chromatography to test a lot of shelled corn contaminated with aflatoxin at 10 ng/g, the total variance associated with the test procedure was 149.2 (coefficient of variation of 122.1%). The sampling, sample preparation, and analytical steps accounted for 83.0, 15.6, and 1.4% of the total variance, respectively. A variance of 149.2 suggests that repeated test results will vary from 0 to 33.9 ng/g. Using the same test procedure to detect aflatoxin at 10,000 ng/g, the total variance was 264,719 (coefficient of variation of 5.1%). The sampling, sample preparation, and analytical steps accounted for 41, 57, and 2% of the total variance, respectively. A variance of 264,719 suggests that repeated test results will vary from 8,992 to 11,008 ng/g. Foods contaminated at low levels reflect a situation in which a small percentage of particles is contaminated and sampling becomes the largest source of uncertainty. Large samples are required to overcome the ""needle-in-the-haystack"" problem. Aflatoxin is easier to detect and identify in foods intentionally contaminated at high levels than in foods with low levels of contamination because the relative standard deviation (coefficient of variation) decreases and the percentage of contaminated kernels increases with an increase in concentration.",Journal of food protection,"['D000348', 'D000704', 'D000818', 'D023482', 'D002851', 'D004305', 'D005504', 'D006801', 'D008962', 'D015203', 'D012680', 'D003313']","['Aflatoxins', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Bioterrorism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Food Analysis', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Zea mays']",Sampling uncertainties for the detection of chemical agents in complex food matrices.,"['Q000302', None, None, 'Q000517', 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['isolation & purification', None, None, 'prevention & control', 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15954725,2005

Male Sprague Dawley (S-D) rats (250-300 g) were administered with fivefold dose range of CF (74-370 mg/kg, ip), and TCE (250-1250 mg/kg, ip) in corn oil and sevenfold dose range of AA (5-35 mg/kg, ip) in distilled water. Liver injury was assessed by plasma alanine amino transferase (ALT) activity and liver tissue repair was measured by (3) H-thymidine incorporation into hepatonuclear DNA. Blood and liver levels of parent compounds and two major metabolites of TCE [trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and trichloroethanol (TCOH)] were quantified by gas chromatography. Blood and liver CF and AA levels after TM were similar to CF alone or AA alone, respectively. However, the TCE levels in blood and liver were substantially decreased after TM in a dose-dependent fashion compared to TCE alone. Decreased plasma and liver TCE levels were consistent with decreased production of metabolites and elevated urinary excretion of TCE. The antagonistic interaction resulted in lower liver injury than the summation of injury caused by the individual components at all three-dose levels. On the other hand, tissue repair showed a dose-response leading to regression of injury. Although the liver injury was lower and progression was contained by timely tissue repair, 50% mortality occurred only with the high dose combination, which is several fold higher than environmental levels. The mortality could be due to the central nervous system toxicity. These findings suggest that exposure to TM results in lower initial liver injury owing to higher elimination of TCE, and the compensatory liver tissue repair stimulated in a dose-dependent manner mitigates progression of injury after exposure to TM.",Archives of toxicology,"['D000284', 'D000818', 'D002725', 'D051263', 'D004347', 'D005023', 'D007274', 'D008099', 'D008115', 'D008297', 'D020005', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D014238', 'D014241']","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Chloroform', 'D-Alanine Transaminase', 'Drug Interactions', 'Ethylene Chlorohydrin', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Liver', 'Liver Regeneration', 'Male', 'Propanols', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Trichloroacetic Acid', 'Trichloroethylene']","Dose-dependent liver regeneration in chloroform, trichloroethylene and allyl alcohol ternary mixture hepatotoxicity in rats.","[None, None, 'Q000097', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000031', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000097', None, None, 'Q000097', 'Q000097']","[None, None, 'blood', 'blood', None, 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'blood', None, None, 'blood', 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15940471,2006

15913016,"A major, often unrecognized variable regulating plant growth in semi-closed environment is air contaminant. The vapor of propylene glycol (PG), which was used as coolant in growth chambers, has been found to be toxic to corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) plants. PG solution leaked from a valve packing system and volatilized to vapor, which was trapped in a semi-closed growth chamber. Symptoms of leaf edge chlorosis, later developing into necrosis, were observed on the third day of emergence or on the third day after moving healthy plants into the chamber. For young soybean plants, symptoms were slightly different from those observed in corn plants; the chlorosis symptoms were not uniformly distributed on all leaves. Some soybean leaves curled up and others had white spots. This problem was identified by using a portable photoionization detector to obtain instantaneous readings of total volatile organic compound concentrations inside the chambers.

15910407,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that liver tissue repair induced by exposure to chloroform (CHCl(3))+trichloroethylene binary mixture (BM) is dose-dependent similar to that elicited by exposure to these compounds individually. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) received three dose combinations of binary mixture (74+250, 185+500 and 370+1250 mg CHCl(3)+trichloroethylene/kg, intraperitoneally) in corn oil (maximum of 0.5 ml/kg). Liver injury was assessed by plasma alanine amino transaminase (ALT) activity and histopathology by haematoxylin & eosin. Liver tissue repair was measured by (3)H-thymidine incorporation into hepatonuclear DNA. Blood and liver levels of both the parent compounds and two major metabolites of trichloroethylene (trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol) were quantified by gas chromatography. The blood and liver CHCl(3) levels after the administration of binary mixture were similar compared to the administration of CHCl(3) alone. The blood and liver trichloroethylene levels after the binary mixture were significantly lower compared to trichloroethylene alone due to higher elimination in presence of CHCl(3), resulting in decreased production of metabolites. The antagonistic toxicokinetics resulted in lower liver injury than the summation of injury caused by the individual components at all three dose levels. On the other hand, tissue repair elicited by the binary mixture was dose-dependent. The interactive toxicity of this binary mixture of CHCl(3) and trichloroethylene led to subadditive initial liver injury because of a combined effect of higher elimination of TCE and mitigated progression of liver injury was prevented by timely dose-dependent stimulation of compensatory tissue repair. Even though the doses of the toxicants employed in this study are much higher than found in the environment, the results suggest that a mixture of these two compounds at environmental levels is unlikely to cause any exaggerated interactive acute liver toxicity of any biological significance.",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,"['D000410', 'D000818', 'D019540', 'D002725', 'D008099', 'D008115', 'D008297', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D014238', 'D014241']","['Alanine Transaminase', 'Animals', 'Area Under Curve', 'Chloroform', 'Liver', 'Liver Regeneration', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Trichloroacetic Acid', 'Trichloroethylene']",Dose-dependent liver tissue repair after chloroform plus trichloroethylene binary mixture.,"['Q000097', None, None, 'Q000037', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000037']","['blood', None, None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'antagonists & inhibitors']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15910407,2005

However, available food sources of lutein contain only modest amounts of the carotenoid. Food fortification with lutein extract has been identified as a low-budget approach to prevent the onset or progression of AMD. The objectives of this study were to 1) incorporate various amounts of lutein into Cheddar cheese; 2) examine the color, pH, microbiological, and sensory characteristics of the Cheddar cheese during storage; and 3) analyze the stability of lutein during the cheese maturation process. Lutein extracted from corn was added to Cheddar cheese in quantities of 1, 3, and 6 mg per serving size. Measurements of the lutein stability were carried out by HPLC using a YMC C30 carotenoid column. Microbiological analyses of cheese samples included aerobic plate count, coliform, and yeast/mold counts. The color attributes a* and b* were significantly different between the treatment and control groups; however, no significant difference was observed in L* value and pH. Significant differences among 1, 3, and 6 mg lutein-enriched cheeses were observed in the aerobic plate count and yeast/mold compared with the control. Cheese samples contained no detectable levels of coliforms (< 10 cfu/g).

A five-strain cocktail of E. coli O157:H7 containing 3 or 6 log10 cfu/g was inoculated into 100 g ground beef and formed into 10x1-cm patties. A 10-cm diameter filter paper disk treated with AIT suspended in sterile corn oil was placed on top of a single patty. One patty and paper disk were placed in a bag of Nylon/EVOH/PE with O2 permeability of 2.3 cm3 m(-2) 24 h atm at 23 degrees C. The bags were back-flushed with 100% nitrogen, heat-sealed and stored at 10, 4 and -18 degrees C for 8, 21 or 35 days, respectively. During storage, the AIT levels in the package headspaces were determined by gas liquid chromatography, and mesophilic bacteria and E. coli O157:H7 were counted. The mesophilic aerobic bacteria in ground beef patties were largely unaffected by the addition of AIT. At an initial population of 3 log10 cfu/g, E. coli O157:H7 was reduced by AIT to undetectable levels after 18 days at 4 degrees C or 10 days at -18 degrees C.

Bound (hidden) fumonisins cannot be detected by conventional analysis. Improved methods for the determination of bound FB1 were developed. The protein-bound FB1 was extracted with 1% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) solution. The SDS, which interfered with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, was then separated from protein-bound FB1 by complexing with methylene blue followed by solvent extraction and hydrolysis with 2 N KOH. To measure total-bound FB1, the sample itself was hydrolysed with KOH. In both cases, clean-up was accomplished on an OASIS polymeric solid-phase extraction column and the bound fumonisins were determined by HPLC measurement of HFB1. Fourteen of 15 samples of corn flakes and other corn-based breakfast cereals analysed contained detectable levels of FB1 with a mean in positive samples of 67ng g(-1) (13-237 ng g(-1)). Two samples also had detectable levels of FB2 (21-23ng g(-1)). Bound FB1 was found in all samples; the mean protein-bound FB1 measured was 58 ng g(-1) (22-176 ng g(-1)) and the mean total-bound FB1 measured was 106 ng g(-1) (28-418 ng g(-1)), reported as FB1 equivalents after correction for recoveries of HFB1. There was an average of about 1.3 times more FB1 in the bound form compared with extractable FB1, and this was about twice as much as protein-bound FB1. Seven of the 15 samples of alkali-processed corn-based foods, such as tortilla chips and corn chips, contained FB1 and three contained HFB1 with means in measurable positive samples of 78 (48-134) and 29 (13-47) ng g(-1), respectively. Five of these alkali-processed corn foods contained bound FB1; the mean measurable protein-bound FB1 was 42 ng g(-1) (39-46 ng g(-1)) and the mean measurable total-bound FB1 was 100 ng g(-1) (54-209 ng g(-1)).

After the administration of labelled triolein to rats fed the fat-free diet, the incorporation (dpm/g) into total lipids of the liver and adipose tissue each reached the maximum in 8 h and was seven times higher in the adipose tissue than in the liver. The half-lives of total lipid radioactivities during the decreasing phases were 0.39 and 2.58 d, respectively, in the rapid and slow phases of the decay curve in the liver, and 4.78 d in only one phase of the adipose tissue. Radioactivity after administration of labelled triolein was mostly found in the oleic acid in the tissues. The half-life of oleic acid was 3.92 d in the adipose tissues. These half-lives were similar in both dietary groups. Thus, although dietary corn oil reduced the triolein incorporation to cellular lipids in comparison to the fat-free diet, it did not affect these half-lives. The labelled triacylglycerol-oleic acid stayed abundantly intact for a long time in the adipose tissue and was scarcely changed to other fatty acids, whereas it was slightly incorporated into total lipids and quickly metabolized in the liver.

In this report, the stability of DIBOA is studied in two soils from crop lands of wheat cv. Astron and cv. Ritmo. These varieties were selected by their concentrations of DIBOA and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-(2H)-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA) from aerial parts and by the bioactivities of their aqueous extracts in the growth of wheat coleoptile sections. The degradation rate of DIBOA in these soils was measured in laboratory tests during 90 h by high-pressure liquid chromatography methods. These analyses demonstrate that DIBOA was transformed primarily into 2-benzoxazolinone (BOA). This transformation was similar in both soil types with an average half-life of 43 h. The degradation studies for BOA show its biotransformation to 2-aminophenoxazin-3-one (APO) with a half-life of 2.5 days. Therefore, BOA is an intermediate product in the biotransformation from DIBOA to APO in these wheat crop soils and is consistent with previous findings.

15638245,"All fruits, vegetables, and grains contain phytosterols. Numerous clinical studies have documented that phytosterols lower LDL-cholesterol levels and thereby reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Most experts believe that the cholesterol-lowering mechanism of phytosterols requires that they be in their ""free"" form. In addition to their occurrence in the free form, phytosterols also occur as four common phytosterol conjugates: (i) fatty acyl esters, (ii) hydroxycinnamate esters, (iii) steryl glycosides, and (iv) fatty acylated steryl glycosides. This study was undertaken to investigate the extent of hydrolysis of four common phytosterol conjugates by mammalian digestive enzymes (cholesterol esterase and pancreatin, a mixture of pancreatic enzymes) and for comparison purposes, by KOH. Two types of purified hydroxycinnamate esters (sitostanyl ferulate and oryzanol, a mixture of hydroxycinnamate esters purified from rice bran oil) were hydrolyzed by cholesterol esterase and by pancreatin. Both cholesterol esterase and pancreatin hydrolyzed the phytosteryl esters in two functional food matrices, and they hydrolyzed the hydroxycinnamate esters in corn fiber oil. This is the first report to demonstrate that phytostanyl ferulate esters (which are present at levels of 3-6% in corn fiber oil) are hydrolyzed by pancreatic cholesterol esterase. It is also the first report that pancreatin contains enzymes that hydrolyze the fatty acyl moiety of fatty acylated steryl glycoside, converting it to steryl glycoside. Pancreatin had no effect on steryl glycosides. The ability of pancreatin to hydrolyze three other types of lipid conjugates was also evaluated. Phospholipids were completely hydrolyzed. About half of the galactolipids were hydrolyzed, and less than 10% of the polyamine conjugates were hydrolyzed. The extents of hydrolysis of phytosteryl esters by base (saponification) were also studied, and conditions commonly used for the saponification of acyl lipids (1.5 N methanolic KOH, 30 min at 70 degrees C), were found to result in a nearly 100% hydrolysis of TAG but only about 35-45% hydrolysis of the phytosteryl fatty acyl esters or phytosteryl hydroxycinnamate esters.",Lipids,"['D000818', 'D002851', 'D004950', 'D005502', 'D006868', 'D008322', 'D015394', 'D010840', 'D013696']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Esterases', 'Food', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mammals', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phytosterols', 'Temperature']",The in vitro hydrolysis of phytosterol conjugates in food matrices by mammalian digestive enzymes.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15638245,2005

PCBs, PCDFs and PCDDs suspended in nonane were incubated with RBF (10 mg/ml) at 37 degrees C and after centrifugation, unbound chemicals in the supernatant were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). The binding effects on RBF were enhanced more than other dietary fibers (DFs), which were tested including corn, wheat bran, spinach, Hijiki (a kind of seaweed), sweet potatoes and burdock fibers. It was found that the binding effects were related to lignin contents. Binding of 3-amino-1(or 1,4)-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-p-1 and Trp-p-2), food-derived carcinogens and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), suspended in methanol, to RBF occurred within 10 min of incubation at 37 degrees C at pH 5-7, and decreased below pH 4; binding of food-derived carcinogens was pH dependent. The binding effects to RBF and pulp lignin were obtained at ratio of over 90%, while corn fiber and cellulose were at ratios of 4-30%. Polycyclic aromatic compounds were related to the number of rings, showing high binding effects to chemical structures with triple rings. Binding of 1-NP and PCB to RBF was not influenced in any aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures. It was also found that RBF was capable of binding even conjugates containing mutagens such as glucuronides and sulfates, as well as metabolites in urine.

Salmon oil produced the greatest amount of MA (1070+/-77.0 ppm of oil) when it was heated at 60 degrees C for 7 d. The highest formation of glyoxal was obtained from salmon oil heated at 60 degrees C for 3 d. More glyoxal was found from salmon and cod liver oils when they were heated for 3 d (12.8+/-1.10 and 7.07+/-0.19 ppm, respectively) than for 7 d (6.70+/-0.08 and 5.94+/-0.38 ppm, respectively), suggesting that glyoxal underwent secondary reactions during a prolonged time. The amount of methyglyoxal formed ranged from 2.03+/-0.13 (cod liver oil) to 2.89+/-0.11 ppm (tuna oil) in the fish oils heated at 60 degrees C for 7 d. Among vegetable oils, only olive oil yielded methylglyoxal (0.61+/-0.03 ppm) under accelerated storage conditions. When oils were treated under cooking conditions, the aldehydes formed were comparable to those formed under accelerated storage conditions. Fish oils produced more MA, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal than did vegetable oils because the fish oils contained higher levels of long-chain PUFA, such as EPA and DHA, than did the vegetable oils.

15478994,"Besides the health benefits associated with whole-grain consumption, cereals are recognized sources of health-enhancing bioactive components such as carotenoids, which are a group of yellow pigments involved in the prevention of many degenerative diseases and which have been used for a long time as indicators of the color quality of durum wheat and pasta products. This work reports a fast, sensitive, and selective procedure for the extraction and determination of carotenoids from cereals and cereal byproducts. The method involves sample saponification and extraction followed by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, allowing the separation of the main carotenoids pigments of cereals, especially lutein and zeaxanthin. An application of the established method to various species of cereals and cereal byproducts is also shown. The highest carotenoid levels were found in maize (approximately 11.14 mg/kg of dry weight), which contains high amounts of beta-cryptoxanthin (2.40 mg/kg of dry weight), and, among the cereals considered, has the highest content of zeaxanthin (6.43 mg/kg of dry weight) and alpha+beta-carotene (1.44 mg/kg of dry weight). With the exception of maize, lutein is the main compound found (from 0.23 to 2.65 mg/kg of dry weight in oat and durum wheat, respectively). Moreover, whereas alpha+beta-carotene and zeaxanthin are principally localized in the germ, lutein is equally distributed along the kernel.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002338', 'D002851', 'D002523', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Carotenoids', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Edible Grain', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Improved normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography procedure for the determination of carotenoids in cereals.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15478994,2004

Isotopic analysis of the lipid-free and lipid fraction of the fish after the experiment revealed that the trophic shift was not constant for wheat- and corn-based diets.

The levels of two Fusarium toxins, nivalenol and deoxynivalenol (DON) were quantitated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a total of 97 samples of dietary wheat flour, barley and corn collected from families in two areas with high mortality rate of cancer of esophagus and gastric cardia (132/100,000), Linxian, Henan province and Cixiang, Hepei province, China. The mean level of NIV and DON in three dietary foods was 830+/-927 microg/kg (range 584-1,780 microg/kg) and 4,281+/-6,114 microg/kg (range 732-10,980 microg/kg) respectively. The highest mean level of NIV was 1,780+/-1,705 microg/kg found in barley from Linxian, that of DON was 10,980+/-10,139 microg/kg found in corn from Cixiang. NIV was undetectable in 2 samples of rice from USA. The mean levels of NIV in three main dietary foods in those two high-risk areas were estimated at 400 to 800-fold higher than that in the USA, where NIV was undetectable in dietary food, and the mortality rate of esophageal cancer is <5/100,000 in white Caucasians in the USA, (odds ratio was estimated at 17-34, p<0.000005). These data suggest that Linxian and Cixiang peasants who consumed a diet with high NIV had significantly higher risk for developing esophageal cancer than the US residents who consumed food without or with negligible amounts of NIV.

The purified residue, formed by evaporation of the elution solvent, was reacted with fluorescamine and the fumonisin B1-derivative was separated by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography using a developing solution of methanol/aqueous 4% potassium chloride (70:30). The derivatized FB1 was readily visualized as a greenish-yellow spot under long wavelength ultraviolet light and quantified by visual comparison with a set of similarly derivatized standards in the range 20-300 ng FB1 spotted on plate.

A total of 90 samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) as the principal method following sample dissolution by dry and wet ashing.

A number of instrument- and antibody-based methods including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been developed to detect zearalenone (ZEN) and related toxins in commodities and foods. Although convenient, the commercial ELISAs for small molecules such as ZEN require a washing step to separate bound and unbound enzyme label before detection. In fluorescence polarization immunoassays, separation of bound and unbound label is not required, a property that reduces the time needed to perform the assays. We developed a fluorescence polarization immunoassay for ZEN in maize. When combined with a rapid extraction technique, the assay could be used to detect as little as 0.11 microg of ZEN g(-1) maize within 10 min.

15068068,"Effects of including silage in the diet on volatile compound profiles and their modification during ripening of Montasio cheeses were examined. Twelve farms were selected and grouped according the type of forage in the ration: hay-based diets (four farms); hay and corn silage-based diets (four farms); and diets based on hay, corn silage and grass silages (four farms). For cheesemaking, 1000 kg of milk collected from two consecutive milkings was sampled from each farm and processed in the same cheese factory. Cheeses were ripened in the same cellar, in controlled humidity (78-85% relative humidity) and temperature (9-12 degrees C), until analysis. After 68 (62-74), 200 (194-206) and 360 (354-366) d of ripening, a cheese from each batch was analysed for moisture, protein and fat, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and volatile compounds. These latter were analysed by dynamic reverse carrier gas headspace gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique, scanning from m/z 29 to m/z 300 at 0.5 s cycle time. Total and individual VFA contents of cheeses did not differ between the different dietary treatments and increased linearly (P<0.01) during ripening, indicating that there were no appreciable defects of fermentation. Sixty-two volatile compounds were identified in the cheese samples: 12 aldehydes, 9 ketones, 16 alcohols, 17 esters, 2 hydrocarbons, 4 sulphur-containing compounds and 2 terpenes. Diet significantly affected the amount of total alcohols, ethanol, isobutanol, 1-penten-3-ol, 2-methyl-1-butanol and the sum of all the volatile compounds. Significant variations of 33 volatile compounds (9 aldehydes, 4 ketones, 6 alcohols, 10 esters, 1 hydrocarbons, 2 sulphur containing compounds, and 1 terpene) were observed during ripening. These results suggest that the influence of diet composition on volatile compounds of matured cheeses are related more to effects on microbial and chemical fermentations in cheese during ripening rather than to a direct transfer of molecules from milk.",The Journal of dairy research,"['D000438', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D002611', 'D004032', 'D004952', 'D005232', 'D005511', 'D008401', 'D007558', 'D007659', 'D008055', 'D008894', 'D012820', 'D013457', 'D013729', 'D014835']","['Alcohols', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cheese', 'Diet', 'Esters', 'Fatty Acids, Volatile', 'Food Handling', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Italy', 'Ketones', 'Lipids', 'Milk Proteins', 'Silage', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Terpenes', 'Volatilization']",Effects of including silage in the diet on volatile compound profiles in Montasio cheese and their modification during ripening.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15068068,2004
15066833,"Dietary ferulic acid (FA), a significant antioxidant substance, is currently the subject of extensive research. FA in cereals exists mainly as feruloylated sugar ester. To release FA from food matrices, it is necessary to cleave ester cross-linking by feruloyl esterase (FAE) (hydroxycinnamoyl esterase; EC 3.1.1.73). In the present study, the FAE from a human typical intestinal bacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, was isolated, purified, and characterized for the first time. The enzyme was purified in successive steps including hydrophobic interaction chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography. The purified FAE appeared as a single band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa. It has optimum pH and temperature characteristics (5.6 and 37 degrees C, respectively). The metal ions Cu(2+) and Fe(3+) (at a concentration of 5 mmol liter(-1)) inhibited FAE activity by 97.25 and 94.80%, respectively. Under optimum pH and temperature with 5-O-feruloyl-L-arabinofuranose (FAA) as a substrate, the enzyme exhibited a K(m) of 0.0953 mmol liter(-1) and a V(max) of 86.27 mmol liter(-1) min(-1) mg(-1) of protein. Furthermore, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified FAE was found to be A R V E K P R K V I L V G D G A V G S T. The FAE released FA from O-(5-O-feruloyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl)-(1-->3)-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)-D-xylopyranose (FAXX) and FAA obtained from refined corn bran.

Identification and quantitative analysis of pesticides in matrices were performed by quadrupole GC/MS and ion-trap GC/MS/MS. Chlorpyrifos was added to the matrix of spinach, soybean in the pod or corn, and aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, gamma-BHC, delta-BHC, p,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDT were added to each matrix of green tea, black tea or oolong tea. Although most of the pesticides in the matrix could not be determined by quadrupole GC/MS-Scan analysis at 0.1 microgram/mL, every pesticide was identified from the mass spectrum using ion-trap GC/MS/MS at the same concentration. The quantitation limit of every pesticide in each matrix by ion-trap GC/MS/MS analysis was higher than that by GC/MS-SIM analysis. The calibration curves obtained by GC/MS/MS were linear in the range of 0.01-0.25 microgram/mL of each pesticide.

Using different LC conditions, deoxynivalenol (DON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), and zearalenone (ZEN) were detected in four different matrices (fungal liquid cultures, maize grain, insect larvae and pig serum). The sensitivity of MS detection allowed us to detect concentrations as low as 8 ppb of DON and 12 ppb of ZEN. A very small quantity of matrix was therefore necessary for successful analysis of these toxins and a variety of experimental situations were successfully investigated using this technique. Production of 15-ADON and butenolide was monitored in a liquid culture of F. graminearum under controlled conditions. Using simple extraction procedures, the differential accumulation of DON and 15-ADON was followed in inoculated maize genotypes varying in susceptibility to F. graminearum. Toxicokinetic studies were carried out with maize insect pests reared continually on artificial diets containing ZEN and suggested that larvae may possess the ability to degrade ZEN. Finally, persistence of DON was assessed in pigs fed diet supplemented with DON, results indicated that DON accumulates quickly in pig blood and then levels decline progressively for 12 hours thereafter.

Cucurbitacins are reported to be gibberellin antagonists that may preclude their use as seed treatments for these soil-dwelling insects. The crude extract of a bitter Hawkesbury watermelon containing cucurbitacin E-glycoside significantly inhibited germination of watermelon, squash, and tomato seeds. Although the germination of corn seed was not significantly inhibited, root elongation was inhibited by crude extracts, but not by high-performance liquid chromatography-purified cucurbitacin E-glycoside. Therefore, the effects of the major components in the bitter watermelon extract (e.g., sugars) on seed germination and root elongation were determined. Pure sugars (glucose and fructose), at concentrations found in watermelon extract, mimicked the inhibition of seed germination and root elongation seen with the crude bitter Hawkesbury watermelon extract.

Diacetyl (NMAM 2557) is efficiently recovered from an Anasorb CMS sampler tube when the composition of methanol in the desorption solvent is 1%, and acetoin (NMAM 2558) is efficiently recovered when the concentration of methanol is increased to 5%. Desorption efficiencies for diacetyl and acetoin were acceptable, 89.9% (RSD = 0.018) and 94.9% (RSD = 0.019), respectively. Recoveries for nonanone, methyl ethyl ketone, and ethyl acetate were not optimized because they were present in very low concentrations in the popcorn processing facility and not considered to be major occupational health hazards. Samples were collected on Anasorb CMS solid sorbent tubes. All analytes were separated using a 30-m Stabilwax-DA fused silica capillary column, followed by analysis using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. These methods were acceptable for monitoring and identifying exposures to diacetyl and acetoin present in the butter flavoring mixture used at popcorn processing facilities. For example, in the initial site visit the method was used to determine that maximum workers exposures to diacetyl (462.6 mg/m3), acetoin (59.1 mg/m3), and nonanone (0.45 mg/m3) occurred as the butter flavoring was added to the mixing kettle. When protective measures were recommended by NIOSH personnel and implemented bythe popcorn processing facility, the methods were then used to determine the effectiveness of these changes, which showed that diacetyl and acetoin concentrations had been reduced significantly to 0.97 and 2.3 mg/m3, respectively, while the concentration of nonanone fell to levels below the detection limit (LOD).",Environmental science & technology,"['D000093', 'D016902', 'D003931', 'D004784', 'D019649', 'D006801', 'D008872', 'D016273', 'D017132', 'D003313']","['Acetoin', 'Air Pollution, Indoor', 'Diacetyl', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Food Industry', 'Humans', 'Microwaves', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Workplace', 'Zea mays']",Method development for the determination of diacetyl and acetoin at a microwave popcorn plant.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14968874,2004

The method was applied to corn silage samples collected from the midwestern area of the United States during 2001-2002. Of 89 corn silage samples, fumonisin B(1), fumonisin B(2), and fumonisin B(3) were found in 86 (97%), 64 (72%), and 51 (57%) of the samples. The mean positive levels of fumonisin B(1), fumonisin B(2), and fumonisin B(3) were 615, 93, and 51 ng/g, respectively, in dried silage.

14726278,"Within the certification process of a reference material for the determination of the mycotoxin zearalenone (ZON) in maize, short- and long-time stability tests of naturally contaminated maize have been performed. The short-term stability of ZON in the maize was evaluated under four different conditions (4, 25, 40 and 70 degrees C) in preliminary studies. Four storage times of 0, 1, 2 and 4 weeks were investigated using HPLC. The long-term stability study was conducted with measurements after 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months under three storage conditions (4, 25 and 40 degrees C) in preliminary studies using HPLC. Stability data gained under two different conditions (4 and 25 degrees C) with five storage times of 0, 1, 6, 12 and 18 months were further evaluated for the contaminated maize in the certification process. Before the certification, the maize matrix had been characterized with respect to dry residue, ash content, fat content, protein content, ergosterol content and total dietary fibre, and the efficiency of gamma-irradiation on the fungal flora was investigated. The stability of the maize matrix was evaluated by monitoring UV absorption and ergosterol content under four different storage conditions (4, 25, 35 and 70 degrees C) with five storage times of 0, 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. Other possibly occurring mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol, fusarenon X and moniliformin) have been quantified.

The analytical techniques used were silica gel column chromatography and high-performance size exclusion chromatography. The decrease in ox-TG during refining (42.3% on average) was accompanied by an increase in triglyceride oligopolymers (TGP). The inverse correlation between the two lipid groups suggests that the decrease in ox-TG during refining was due in part to the occurrence of polymerization reactions. An inverse correlation was also found between the percentage sum of ox-TG + TGP and percent TGP, indicating that a part of the ox-TG also underwent degradation or transformation reactions.

The device consists of membrane strips, with antibody-immobilized zones, attached to a polyethylene card. A moist filter paper placed between the membrane and the polyethylene card acts as the absorbent body. The device was used to estimate very low concentrations of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) present in food samples by using an improved catalyzed reporter deposition (Super-CARD) method of signal amplification involving biotinylated tyramine (B-T) and avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. 4-chloro-1-naphthol was used as the substrate for visualization. Semiquantitative results are obtained by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards. Quantitative estimation is possible by densitometric analysis (detection limit 0.25 pg/spot, 0.01 ng mL(-1)). Dilute samples can be assayed by in situ concentration with improved dose-response characteristics. A batch of 12 extracted samples can be analyzed in a single test card within 12 min. Spiked and contaminated samples of groundnut, corn, wheat, cheese, and chilli were analyzed without sample cleanup. The matrix interferences were eliminated by using appropriate dilution of the aqueous methanol extracts. Mean recoveries from different food samples were between 91 and 104%.

The 197 most abundant proteins were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry involving overlapping pH gradients (pH 4-7 and 6-9). Database searches identified 58 genes that encode 100 of these protein spots. Functions could be predicted for 38 of the 58 genes (66%). All but one of these genes are located in the nuclear genome. Thirteen per cent of the analyzed protein spots (25 out of 197) exhibited at least a threefold difference in accumulation between the mitochondrial proteomes of NA- or T-cytoplasm maize plants that had essentially identical nuclear genomes. As most of these proteins were nuclear-encoded, these findings demonstrate that the genotype of a mitochondrion can regulate the accumulation of the nuclear-encoded fraction of its proteome.

14667708,"Eight commercial starches, including common corn, waxy corn, wheat, tapioca, potato, Hylon V, Hylon VII, and mung bean starch, were annealed by a multiple-step process, and their gelatinization characteristics were determined. Annealed starches had higher gelatinization temperatures, reduced gelatinization ranges, and increased gelatinization enthalpies than their native starches. The annealed starches with the highest gelatinization enthalpies were subjected to acid hydrolysis with 15.3% H2SO4, and Naegeli dextrins were prepared after 10 days' hydrolysis. Annealing increased the acid susceptibility of native starches in the first (rapid) and the second (slow) phases with potato starch showing the greatest and high amylose starches showing the least changes. Starches with a larger shift in onset gelatinization temperature also displayed a greater percent hydrolysis. The increase in susceptibility to acid hydrolysis was proposed to result from defective and porous structures that resulted after annealing. Although annealing perfected the crystalline structure, it also produced void space, which led to porous structures and possible starch granule defects. The molecular size distribution and chain length distribution of Naegeli dextrins of annealed and native starches were analyzed. The reorganization of the starch molecule during annealing occurred mainly within the crystalline lamellae. Imperfect double helices in the crystalline lamellae improved after annealing, and the branch linkages at the imperfect double helices became protected by the improved crystalline structure.

Here, we provide further mechanistic evidence of mutual metabolic interactions between BaP and TBT in response to long-term, repeated exposures to low doses. Juvenile Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) received 10 separate i.p. injections (a single injection every 6 days) of BaP (3 mg/kg), TBT (0.3 mg/kg), or both in combination; control fish received corn oil vehicle only. Two days after the 2nd (Day 8), 6th (Day 32), and 10th dose (Day 56), blood, bile, and liver samples were collected and analyzed for a suite of biomarkers. HPLC/fluorescence analysis indicated that TBT cotreatment inhibited the formation of (+)-anti-BaP diol-epoxide adducts with plasma albumin (53%, Day 8), hepatic DNA (27%, Day 32), or both albumin and globin (50 and 58%, Day 56) compared to BaP alone. This antagonistic interaction was associated with a time-dependent modulation (inhibition at Day 8, enhancement at Day 32) of both cytochrome P450 (P450)1A-mediated ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity and biliary BaP metabolite formation. TBT cotreatment also inhibited (39%) the BaP-mediated induction of hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity observed at Day 8. Treatment with TBT alone increased EROD activity (60%) at Day 32, but decreased both GST activity (70 and 37%) and glutathione content (24% and 16%) at Days 32 and 56, respectively. GC/MS analysis revealed that, at Day 56, BaP cotreatment increased (200%) the levels of biliary butyltin compounds, including mono- and dibutyltin metabolites. This potentiative interaction was associated with a protective effect of BaP cotreatment against the TBT-mediated decreases in GST activity and glutathione content.

14554101,"Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin produced by several fungi of Aspergillus and Penicillium species, is a nephrotoxin and a renal carcinogen in rodents. This study was performed to investigate the biotransformation and toxicokinetics of this important food contaminant. Male (n=18) and female (n=18) F344 rats were administered a single dose of OTA (0.5 mg/kg b.w.) in corn oil by gavage. Animals (n=3) were sacrificed 24, 48, 72, 96, 672, and 1,344 hours after OTA administration and concentrations of OTA and OTA-metabolites in urine, feces, blood, liver, and kidney were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection and/or by LC-MS/MS. Recovery of unchanged OTA in urine amounted to 2.1% of dose in males and 5.2% in females within 96 h. In feces, only 5.5% respectively 1.5% of dose were recovered. The major metabolite detected was OTalpha; low concentrations of OTA-glucosides were also present in urine. The maximal blood levels of OTA were observed between 24 and 48 h after administration and were appromixately 4.6 micromol/l in males and 6.0 micromol/l in females. Elimination of OTA from blood followed first-order kinetics with a half-life of approximately 230 h. In liver of both male and female rats, OTA-concentrations were less than 12 pmol/g tissue, with a maximum at 24 h after administration. In contrast, OTA accumulated in the kidneys, reaching a concentration of 480 pmol/g tissue in males 24 h after OTA-administration. Generally, tissue concentrations in males were higher than in females. OTalpha was not detected in liver and kidney tissue of rats administered OTA, and the OTalpha concentrations in blood were low (10-15 nmol/l). The high concentrations of OTA in kidneys of male rats may, in part, explain the organ- and gender-specific toxicity of OTA.",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,"['D000818', 'D001711', 'D002851', 'D005243', 'D005260', 'D007408', 'D008297', 'D013058', 'D009793', 'D051381', 'D011916', 'D012727', 'D013050', 'D014018']","['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Ochratoxins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tissue Distribution']",Toxicokinetics of the mycotoxin ochratoxin A in F 344 rats after oral administration.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000493', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'pharmacokinetics', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14554101,2003

Corn samples from a single genotype (RWA2, blanks, and contaminated with Fusarium graminearum) were ground, sieved and, after appropriate sample preparation, subjected to mid-infrared spectroscopy using two different accessories (diffuse reflection and attenuated total reflection). The measured spectra were evaluated with principal component analysis (PCA) and the blank and contaminated samples were classified by cluster analysis. Reference data for fungal metabolites were obtained with conventional methods. After extraction and clean-up, each sample was analyzed for the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) and ergosterol (a parameter for the total fungal biomass) by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The concentration ranges for contaminated samples were 880-3600 microg/kg for ergosterol and 300-2600 microg/kg for DON. Classification efficiency was 100% for ATR spectra. DR spectra did not show as obvious a clustering of contaminated and blank samples. Results and trends were also observed in single spectra plots. Quantification using a PLS1 regression algorithm showed good correlation with DON reference data, but a rather high standard error of prediction (SEP) with 600 microg/kg (DR) and 490 microg/kg (ATR), respectively, for ergosterol.

Four discrete spectral forms of Pchlide, with emission peaks around 633, 640, 656 and 670 nm, could be distinguished after Gaussian deconvolution. In maize and wheat the 656 nm component was the most prominent, whereas for wild-type pea and its lip1 mutant, the 633 and 640 nm components contributed mostly to the fluorescence emission spectra. For the fluorescence lifetimes measured at 77 K a double exponential model was the most adequate to describe the Pchlide fluorescence decay not only for the Pchlide(650-656) form but also for the short-wavelength Pchlide forms. A fast component in the range 0.3-0.8 ns and a slow component in the range 5.1-7.1 ns were present in all samples, but the values varied, depending on species. The long-wavelength Pchlide(650-656) form had a slow component with a lifetime between 5.1 and 6.7 ns, probably reflecting the fluorescence from aggregated Pchlide. The short-wavelength Pchlide(628-633) form had values of the slow component varying between 6.2 and 7.1 ns. This represents a monomeric but probably protein-bound Pchlide form because the free Pchlide in solution has a much longer lifetime around 10 ns at 77 K.

We describe a methodology for the detection of gliadins in maize and rice foods based on a two-step procedure of extraction (60% aqueous ethanol followed by 1 M acetic acid). Subsequent MALDI-TOFMS analysis of the resulting acidic extract from these gluten-free foods clearly confirms the presence of a typical mass pattern corresponding to gliadin components, ranging from 30 to 45 kDa. Depending on the percentages of maize or rice flours employed in the elaboration of these foods, the combined procedure enables levels of gliadins from 100 to 400 ppm to be detected.

Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured to assess liver injury, and 3H-thymidine (3H-T) incorporation into hepatonuclear DNA was measured as an index of liver regeneration over a time course of 0-72 h. Male Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats received single ip injection of 5-fold dose range of CHCl(3) (74, 185 and 370 mg/kg) in corn oil (maximum 0.5 ml/kg) and 7-fold dose range of AA (5, 20 and 35 mg/kg) in distilled water simultaneously. The doses for BM were selected from individual toxicity studies of CHCl(3) alone [Int. J. Toxicol. 22 (2003) 25], and AA alone [Reg. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 19 (1999) 165]. Since the highest dose of each treatment (CHCl(3)- 740 and AA- 50 mg/kg) yielded mortality due to the suppressed tissue repair followed by liver failure, this dose was omitted for BM. The levels of CHCl(3) (30-360 min) and AA (5-60 min) were quantified in blood and liver by gas chromatography (GC). The liver injury was more than additive after BM compared to CHCl(3) alone or AA alone at highest dose combination (370+35 mg/kg), which peaked at 24 h. The augmented liver injury observed with BM was consistent with the quantitation data. Though the liver injury was higher, the greater stimulation of tissue repair kept injury from progressing, and rescued the rats from hepatic failure and death. At lower dose combinations, the liver injury was no more than additive.

12797742,"An affinity-based purification procedure with the immobilized family 11 Bacillus subtilis endoxylanase XynA allowed us to obtain high yields of highly pure endoxylanase inhibitor fractions from rye, barley, and durum wheat. In contrast, no inhibitors interacting with the B. subtilis endoxylanase affinity column are present in corn, buckwheat, rice, and oats. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and inhibitor specificity showed that the isolated inhibitors belonged to the TAXI endoxylanase inhibitor family, thus providing a view on the diversity of this cereal inhibitor family. The isolated inhibitors are basic proteins of ca. 40 kDa, occurring in two molecular forms, with pI values of ca. 8.5 (durum wheat) and ca. 9.0 (rye, barley). They are, in general, strong inhibitors of family 11 endoxylanases but not of family 10 endoxylanases. Because cereal endogenous endoxylanases belong to the latter family, this probably indicates that they do not influence cereal metabolic processes.

The absolute amount of ZEA standard detectable on a TLC plate was 20 ng, giving a limit of detection (LOD) of 100 ng g(-1). In some samples, it was shown that aflatoxins interfere with ZEA. Therefore, to remove this interference, the TLC mobile phase was changed. Data revealed that three of 40 (7.5%) maize samples contained ZEA in the range 100-212 ng g(-1), with a mean of 141+/-51 ng g(-1).

12769739,"There are many examples of biologically active food proteins, with physiological significance beyond the pure nutritional requirements that concern available nitrogen for normal growth and maintenance. Moreover, there are many physiologically active peptides, derived by protease activity from various food protein sources; however, relationships between structural properties and functional activities have not been completely elucidated. Many bioactive peptides have in common structural properties that include a relatively short peptide residue length (e.g. 2-9 amino acids), possessing hydrophobic amino acid residues in addition to proline, lysine or arginine groups. Bioactive peptides are also resistant to the action of digestion peptidases. Antihypertensive peptides, known as Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been derived from milk, corn and fish protein sources. Peptides with opioid activities are derived from wheat gluten or casein, following digestion with pepsin. Exorphins, or opioid peptides derived from food proteins such as wheat and milk (e.g. exogenous sources) have similar structure to endogenous opioid peptides, with a tyrosine residue located at the amino terminal or bioactive site. Immunomodulatory peptides derived from tryptic hydrolysates of rice and soybean proteins act to stimulate superoxide anions (reactive oxygen species-ROS), which triggers non-specific immune defense systems. Antioxidant properties that prevent peroxidation of essential fatty acids have also been shown for peptides derived from milk proteins. The addition of a Leu or Pro residue to the N-terminus of a His-His, dipeptide will enhance antioxidant activity and facilitate further synergy with non-peptide antioxidants (e.g. BHT). We also show herein, that the tryptic digests of casein yielding caseinophosphopeptides exhibits both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity due to both metal ion sequestering and quenching of ROS. The separation and purification of bioactive peptides which will involve development of automated and continuous systems is an important field for Food chemists. Much effort has been given to develop selective column chromatography methods that can replace batch methods of salting out, or using solvent extraction to isolate and purify bioactive peptides. Advances here will enable recovery of bioactive peptides with minimal destruction thus enabling utilization by returning these active peptides to functional food or specific nutraceutical applications.",Current pharmaceutical design,"['D000276', 'D000890', 'D000975', 'D003611', 'D004044', 'D002523', 'D004527', 'D005396', 'D005502', 'D006801', 'D008903', 'D018847', 'D010455', 'D010940']","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Dairy Products', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Edible Grain', 'Egg Proteins', 'Fish Products', 'Food', 'Humans', 'Minerals', 'Opioid Peptides', 'Peptides', 'Plant Proteins']",Bioactive proteins and peptides from food sources.

Corn-based infant foods containing cornmeal, corn starch, and corn flour were purchased in the city of Campinas, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and were analyzed for fumonisins B1 (FB1), B2 (FB2), and B3 (FB3) following extraction with a range of solvents. Comparison of the results from each of the samples indicated that acidified 70% aqueous methanol at pH 4.0 provided the best overall performance, whereas a methanol/boric acid (pH 9.2) mixture displayed poor extraction efficiency. Extraction with acidified 70% aqueous methanol showed seven of eight test samples to be positive for FB1 (range, 30 to 6,127 microg/kg; relative SD, 4.2 to 51.7%), two of eight samples to be positive for FB2 (range, 53 to 1,738 microg/kg; relative SD, 4.5 to 5.3%), and one of eight samples to be positive for FB3 (575 microg/kg).

Cows were fed total mixed rations containing (dry matter basis) 44% corn silage, 22% alfalfa silage, 2% urea, and 31% concentrate. The basal diet contained 31% high-moisture corn; equal N from one of four protein supplements was added to the other diets at the expense of corn: 9% solvent soybean meal (SSBM), 10% expeller soybean meal (ESBM), 5.5% blood meal (BM), and 7% corn gluten meal (CGM). Omasal sampling was used to quantify total AA N (TAAN) and nonammonia N (NAN) flows from the rumen. Estimates of RUP were made from differences between total and microbial N flows, including a correction for RUP in the basal diet. Modifying a spectrophotometric assay improved total purine recovery from isolated bacteria and omasal samples and gave estimates of microbial TAAN and NAN flows that were similar to a standard HPLC method. Linear programming, based on AA patterns of the diet and isolated omasal bacteria and ruminal protozoa, appeared to overestimate microbial TAAN and NAN flows compared to the purine assays. Yields of microbial TAAN and NAN determined using any method was not affected by diet and averaged 32 to 35 g NAN per kilogram of organic matter truly digested in the rumen. On average, National Research Council (NRC) equations underpredicted microbial N flows by 152 g/d (vs. HPLC), 168 g/d (vs. spectrophotometry), and 244 g/d (vs. linear programming).

A methacrylic acid-based imprinted polymer was prepared by precipitation polymerisation using propazine as template and toluene as porogen. After removal of the template by Soxhlet extraction, the optimum loading, washing, and elution conditions for MISPE of the selected triazines were established. The optimised MISPE procedure was applied to the extraction of the selected triazines in pea, potato, and corn sample extracts and a high degree of clean-up was obtained. However, some remaining interferences, non-specifically and strongly bound to the polymeric matrix, appeared in the chromatogram, preventing quantification of DIA in potatoes and DIA, DEA, and propazine in corn samples. Thus, a new clean-up protocol based on the use of a non-imprinted polymer for removal of these interferences prior to the MISPE step was developed.

The results showed a strong influence of the solvent composition on recovery of ZON. Quantification of the analytes was performed by LC-MS analysis of the raw extract using matrix-matched standard curves. The method performance was tested in the selected conditions (80 degrees C; 5 min; two cycles; methanol-acetonitrile) on samples which had been previously used for an international proficiency test. Compared to the assigned value, the recovered ZON was 118% [relative standard deviation (RSD)=5.2%, n=3)] and 107% (RSD=2.2%, n=3) in wheat and corn, respectively. Therefore, PLE can be used for ZON extraction, achieving good performances and allowing for an automated handling of the sample extraction step.

Tomatoes contain small amounts of flavonoids, most of which are located in the peel of the fruit. It has been shown that flavonoid accumulation in tomato flesh, and hence an overall increase in flavonoid levels in tomato fruit, can be achieved by means of simultaneous overexpression of the maize transcription factors LC and C1. Fruit from progeny of two modified lines (2027 and 2059) was selected for a detailed analysis and individual identification of flavonoids, at different stages of maturity. Nine major flavonoids were detected in the flesh of transgenic ripe tomatoes. LC/NMR, LC/MS, and LC/MS/MS enabled us to identify these as kaempferol-3,7-di-O-glucoside (1), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside-7-O-glucoside (2), two dihydrokaempferol-O-hexosides (3 and 4), rutin (5), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (6), kaempferol-3-O-glucoside (7), naringenin-7-O-glucoside (8) and naringenin chalcone (9), which were quantified by HPLC/DAD.

12661024,"Maize oil commands a premium price and is thus a target for adulteration with cheaper vegetable oils. Detection of this activity presents a particular challenge to the analyst because of the natural variability in the fatty acid composition of maize oils and because of their high sterol and tocopherol contents. This paper describes a method that allows detection of adulteration at concentrations of just 5% (m/m), based on the Mahalanobis distances of the principal component scores of the delta(13)C values of major and minor vegetable oil components. The method makes use of a database consisting of delta(13)C values and relative abundances of the major fatty acyl components of over 150 vegetable oils. The sterols and tocopherols of 16 maize oils and 6 potential adulterant oils were found to be depleted in (13)C by a constant amount relative to the bulk oil. Moreover, since maize oil contains particularly high levels of sterols and tocopherols, their delta(13)C values were not significantly altered when groundnut oil was added up to 20% (m/m) and it is possible to use the values for the minor components to predict the values that would be expected in a pure oil; therefore, comparison of the predicted values with those obtained experimentally allows adulteration to be detected. A refinement involved performing a discriminant analysis on the delta(13)C values of the bulk oil and the major fatty acids (16:0, 18:1 and 18:2) and using the Mahalanobis distances to determine the percentage of adulterant oil present. This approach may be refined further by including the delta(13)C values of the minor components in the discriminant analysis thereby increasing the sensitivity of the approach to concentrations at which adulteration would not be attractive economically.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D002247', 'D003314', 'D005227', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D012680', 'D013261', 'D024505', 'D003313']","['Carbon Isotopes', 'Corn Oil', 'Fatty Acids', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sterols', 'Tocopherols', 'Zea mays']",High-resolution detection of adulteration of maize oil using multi-component compound-specific delta13C values of major and minor components and discriminant analysis.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12661024,2003

The sample was pressed onto the ATR crystal, and reproducible pressure was applied. After the spectra were recorded, they were subjected to principle component analysis (PCA) and classified using cluster analysis. Observed changes in the spectra reflected changes in protein, carbohydrate, and lipid contents. Ergosterol (for the total fungal biomass) and the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON; a secondary metabolite) of Fusarium fungi served as reference parameters, because of their relevance for the examination of corn based food and feed.

They were detected in 22 and 12 samples, respectively, at respective mean concentrations 68 and 8 ng g(-1). Samples were extracted with methanol-acetonitrile-water (25:25:50) and there was an excellent correlation for FB(1) between results obtained with C(18) clean-up and those obtained with the immunoaffinity column (IAC) clean-up. After extraction of the corn flakes' residue with 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) solution and hydrolysis with 2 N potassium hydroxide, hidden (protein bound) fumonisin was determined as HFB(1), which was found in residues from all the corn flakes samples, even those containing no detectable FB(1); the average concentration of HFB(1) was 101 ng g(-1), equivalent to 180 ng FB(1) g(-1). Thus, our results showed an average of 2.6 times more FB(1) present in bound form as was determined by conventional analysis. We found a correlation coefficient of -0.5034 for a logarithmic relationship between the FB(1) (C(18) clean-up) and HFB(1) concentrations The highest concentration of HFB(1) formed was 288 ng g(-1) from a sample containing only 12-15 ng FB(1) g(-1), while the lowest concentration of HFB(1) was 26 ng g(-1) from a sample with 152-155 ng FB(1) g(-1).

12608753,The strength and the character of the binding of 12 organic solvents to the corn protein zein was determined by preparing zein-coated carbon stationary phase and by measuring the retention of solvents on a high-performance liquid chromatographic column filled with this stationary phase. The relationship between the physicochemical parameters and binding characteristics of solvents was elucidated by principal component analysis. Various interactive forces are involved in the binding of solvent to the protein. The strength of the binding is dominantly influenced by the molecular hydrophobicity while the Gaussian or non-Gaussian distribution of the adsorption strength is markedly dependent on the polarity parameters of the solvent.

12479829,"Fumonisins are secondary metabolites of the fungus Fusarium moniliforme, a common mycotoxin in corn, which are known to cause cancer in a number of experimental animals and have been linked to human esophageal cancer in China and South Africa. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method is currently the most widely used method for the quantitative determination of fumonisins. This method utilizes precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde, isocratic elution, and fluorescence detection. In this study, the HPLC method was chosen as the reference method to evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy of FILIA (flow-injection liposome immunoanalysis) for the detection of the fumonisin B1 (FmB1). Studies indicate that a recovery of 86-90% could be obtained when commercial yellow cornmeal spiked with FmB1 was extracted in 75% methanol, which correlated favorably (correlation coefficient, r(2)=0.945) with the result of 80-92% obtained using the flow-injection liposome immunoanalysis (FILIA) system. The data suggest that the FILIA method is comparable to HPLC for the detection of fumonisins in corn, animal feeds, and human foods. Important features of FILIA as compared to HPLC are, most importantly, lower detection limit (ca. 25 x lower), and also less complex and faster sample preparation and therefore increased analytical throughput.

We adopted an analytical approach to isolate and quantify the mycotoxin and its derivatives using high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In this study, the quantity of zearalenone and its congeners (alpha-zearalenol and beta-zearalenol) present in the plasma of patients with breast (n = 28) and cervical carcinoma (n=54) were compared with levels in patients presenting with other diagnoses (n = 26) and healthy volunteers (n = 24). There were no significant differences between the groups in the levels of zearalenone and its congeners, using analysis of covariance (0.2 < p < 0.6). These results suggest that the presence of this mycotoxin in blood does not indicate causal relationship between exposure to this exogenous myco-oestrogen and the subsequent biological effect in our study population but may be used as an indicator of exposure.

Compressing MCF at 1.4, 6.9, and 69 MPa made a starch plastic with varying porosity. The vapor transmission rate of various volatile compounds through MCF was positively correlated to the vapor pressure of the test compound but was inversely proportional to the compression force used to form the starch plastic.

A positive correlation has been established between the consumption of aflatoxin-contaminated foods and the increased incidence of liver cancer worldwide. A survey of Egyptian corn and corn-based products and by-products shows that the majority of the samples had higher limits of aflatoxin. We have conducted experiments to determine the fate and distribution of aflatoxin during wet-milling process fractions and investigate the aflatoxin destruction during starch conversion to glucose syrup. The present results showed that about half of the aflatoxin content (48.1%) in the infected corn grain was found to be lost in steep liquor, depending upon the aflatoxin type, arranged in the order G1 > G2 > B1 > B2. After wet-milling aflatoxins were distributed into starch, gluten, fiber, and germ. Gluten, fiber, and germ were the most highly contaminated fractions. The loss of aflatoxin during process of starches reached 54.4% in steep water and water process. Although the gluten fraction represents only 9.6% of corn, the higher percentage (25.3%) of aflatoxin was found in this fraction, the fiber and germ account for nearly 29% of the milled corn and contain 11.6% of the aflatoxin. On the other hand, 8.7% of the total aflatoxins in start corn was found in starch fraction which accounts 61% of the milled corn. Aflatoxins G1 and G2 were found lost in higher concentrations compared to the aflatoxin B1 and B2. A higher percentage of AfG1 (86.35%) and AfG2 (78.36%) and a lower percentage of AfB1 (16.3%) and AfB2 (14.7%) were found in starch fraction. The conversion percent of contaminated starch was 89.5% compared with control starch. It can be concluded that aflatoxins were destroyed during starch conversion.

Results of the Ames test were inconclusive: only 1 out of 15 cooked pancakes showed a positive mutagenic response, and all 15 batter specimens were negative; however, several batter specimens showed a weakly positive trend of mutagenicity with extract concentration. Our assay for total nitroso compounds was weakly positive in only 1 out of 15 specimens of sour pancake batter. That specimen was also tested by gas chromatography-TEA for nitrosaminoacids and volatile nitrosamines, but none were detected.

12233854,"Alternaria sp. are important fungal contaminants of grain products; they secrete four structural classes of compounds that are toxic or carcinogenic to plants and animals and cause considerable economic losses to growers and the food-processing industry. Alternaria toxins have been detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and other techniques. Here, we report the development of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for the detection of Alternaria DNA. PCR primers were designed to anneal to the ITS1 and ITS2 regions of the 5.8S rDNA gene of Alternaria alternata or Alternaria solani but not to other microbial or plant DNA. We compared the sensitivity of PCR in detecting Alternaria DNA, that of the HPLC method in detecting Alternaria alternariol and alternariol methyl ether toxins, and that of the morphological examination of mycelia and conidia in experimentally infested corn samples. The sensitivity of toxin detection for HPLC was above the level of contamination in a set of commercially obtained grain samples, resulting in negative scores for all samples, while the PCR-based method and mold growth plating followed by morphological identification of Alternaria gave parallel, positive results for 8 of 10 samples. The PCR assay required just 8 h, enabling the rapid and simultaneous testing of many samples at a low cost.

12207259,"A microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method has been developed for determination of zearalenone in wheat and corn by LC-MS with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface (APCI). Matrix effects were minimized by use of matrix-matched standard curves for quantification of the analyte. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was 30 ng g(-1) in wheat and 20 ng g(-1) in corn. The rapid LC-MS method enabled analysis of the extracts without clean-up, thereby reducing analyte losses, the time required for the analytical procedure, and costs. A factorial design approach was used to examine the effect on extraction efficiency of the main extraction conditions - time, temperature, and solvent. On the basis of results from statistical assessment extraction was performed with 1:1 (v/v) methanol-acetonitrile at 80 degrees C for 5 min. When these extraction conditions were applied to a wheat sample from a recently conducted international proficiency test, 92% (103 ng g(-1)) of the assigned zearalenone concentration (112 ng g(-1)) in the test material was obtained. This result was within the uncertainty (u) range of the assigned value of the test material (u=+/-15.8 ng g(-1), alpha=0.05) thereby demonstrating the accuracy of the method was sufficient.

In addition, the data obtained were correlated with the occurrence of wind-dispersed fungi and the predominant climatic conditions of the two regions studied. Corn mycoflora profiles showed that Fusarium verticillioides prevailed in 35% of the samples from Capão Bonito and in 49% of the samples from Ribeirão Preto. Examination of wind-dispersed fungi also revealed a high incidence of F. verticillioides.

Four composite samples, each comprising (nominally) 10 adult common carp (Cyprinus carpio) or black bass (Micropterus spp.) of the same sex, were collected from each site and analyzed for organochlorine chemical residues by gas chromatography with electron capture detection. At the NCBP stations, which are located on relatively large rivers, concentrations of organochlorine chemical residues were generally lower than when last sampled in the mid-1980s. Residues derived from DDT (primarily p,p'-DDE) were detected at all sites (including the reference site); however, only traces (<or= 0.02 microg/g) of the parent insecticide (p,p'-DDT) were present, which indicates continued weathering of residual DDT from past use. Nevertheless, concentrations of DDT (as p,p'-DDE) in fish from the cotton-farming regions of the lower MRB were great enough to constitute a hazard to fish-eating wildlife and were especially high at the NAWQA sites on the lower-order rivers and streams of the Mississippi embayment. Mirex was detected at only two sites, both in Louisiana, and toxaphene was found exclusively in the lower MRB. Most cyclodiene pesticides (dieldrin, chlordane, and heptachlor epoxide) were more widespread in their distributions, but concentrations were lower than in the 1980s except at a site on the Mississippi River near Memphis, TN.

12009972,"Aflatoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus are commonly found in human and animal foods including grains, cereals, peanut products, sorghum, and soy seeds. Exposure to aflatoxins has been associated with carcinogenicity. This paper reports a simple, portable, and rapid fluorescence polarization (FP) assay for aflatoxin determination in grains. This immunoassay is field portable, homogeneous, and without any washing and cleaning steps. The assay is based upon the competition between free aflatoxin and an aflatoxin-fluorescein tracer for an aflatoxin-specific monoclonal antibody in solution. A series of naturally contaminated corn, sorghum, peanut butter, and peanut paste samples were analyzed by FP and compared with HPLC results. Similarly, spiked popcorn samples were analyzed by FP. FP results of naturally contaminated samples correlated well with HPLC (r (2) = 0.97). FP analysis of spiked popcorn samples (with a mixture of B(1)/B(2)/G(1)/G(2), 7/1/3/1, w/w) gave a good correlation with spiked values (r (2) = 0.99). However, FP consistently underestimated the aflatoxin contents. This was perhaps due to low cross-reactivity of the antibody used toward B(2), G(1), and G(2) aflatoxins.

Photochemical fluorescence enhancement was obtained with 2 different commercially available systems (PCD(UV1) and PCD(UV2)). An electrochemical bromination apparatus was used for bromination. Analyses of naturally contaminated or spiked samples of corn, pistachio paste, peanut butter, fig paste, and animal feed showed that neither of the techniques resulted in derivatization-specific matrix interferences for any of the matrixes under study, even when extracts were not completely purified.

These foods were chosen for their relevance in human and animal nutrition and prepared as they are usually eaten by humans. As confirmed by further investigations the precaecal digestibility is a valuable measure for determining the availability of native B-vitamins. Therefore, pigs were fitted with an end-to-end ileo-rectal anastomosis for digesta passing straight from ileum to rectum, thus avoiding endogenous vitamin synthesis by the colon. Three weeks after surgery the digestibility experiments were carried out during which the animals were fed various experimental diets for a period of 12 days and digesta were collected quantitatively twice a day during the final 5 days of this period. The concentration of vitamin B6 in foods and chyme was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Precaecal digestibility of vitamin B6 from all tested food sources ranged from 51 to 91% in the following order: cabbage diet > banana diet > fish diet > milk powder diet > brewer's yeast diet > soybeans diet > soybean meal diet > egg diet/corn diet > barley diet > wheat bran diet > rye diet. Only boiled brown rice had a very low vitamin B6 availability of 16%.

Although the potential antimutagenic and antioxidant properties of this commercial preparation have been demonstrated, limited information is available on its digestion and absorption by humans. Stability of SCC was examined during simulated gastric and small intestinal digestion. Three preparations were subjected to in vitro digestion: SCC in water, SCC in water + 10% corn oil, and SCC in applesauce. SCC components from raw material preparations and in digested samples were analyzed by C(18) HPLC with photodiode array detection. Cu(II)chlorin e(4), the major chlorin component of SCC, was relatively stable during simulated digestion. In contrast, greater than 90% of Cu(II)chlorin e(6) was degraded to undetermined products during digestion. Recovery of Cu(II)chlorin e(6) after digestion was increased by incorporation of SCC into applesauce, suggesting a protective role of the inclusion matrix for stabilization of labile SCC components. Accumulation of SCC derivatives was investigated by using differentiated cultures of the TC7 clone of the Caco-2 human intestinal cell line. Cellular accumulation from media containing 0.5 to 60 ppm SCC was linear with intracellular content ranging between 0.2 and 29.6 microg of total SCC per mg of cellular protein. Uptake of SCC by Caco-2 cells was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in cultures incubated at 4 degrees C than in those incubated at 37 degrees C. Although intracellular SCC was transported into both apical and basolateral compartments when Caco-2 cells were grown on inserts, apical efflux was significantly greater (p < 0.01) than basolateral efflux.

11834077,"The aim of this work was the optimization of some procedures usually used in the analysis of zearalenone (ZEA) in corn and other cereals by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array and/or fluorescence detection. The comparison of five extraction solvents is presented. Three solid-phase extraction cartridges (C-18, silica, Florisil) and immuno-affinity columns were also compared to obtain the best recovery of the mycotoxin with the minimal presence of co-extractives in the chromatograms. Mixtures of methanol-1% aqueous NaCl (80.20 or 60:40 v/v) were the best extraction solvents. Florisil provided higher recovery of ZEA than C-18, and silica proved unsuitable. The immuno-affinity column was very efficient in cleaning the extracts, but its sample capacity was lower than that of SPE columns due to saturation. The mobile phase (methanol-water 80:20 v/v) gave a low retention time for ZEA (approximately 5 min), high sensitivity and acceptable separation between this mycotoxin and alpha-zearalenol. The optimized protocol is straightforward, provides high ZEA recoveries in spiked corn (mean 102.4%), has an acceptable sensitivity and has a lack of interference with fluorescence detection (detection limit 4 ng ZEA g(-1) corn).

The objective of the present work was to grow T. molitor larvae under standard conditions, to analyze the chemical composition of the larvae powder, and to prepare supplemented maize tortillas. Protein and fat contents were performed with standard methods. Tenebrio larvae powder had a 58.4% protein content; this protein was rich in essential amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; the found values satisfied those recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Fatty acid composition was determined by GC-MS showing high contents of oleic acid and linoleic acid (19.8 and 8.51%, respectively).

We previously demonstrated that PCC, an ethanol extract of a commercial soybean processing by-product, repressed induced genomic DNA damage in mammalian cells. PCC was separated into a series of chemically defined fractions and two fractions (PCC70 and PCC100) repressed mutagen-induced damage.

11455644,"This paper reviews the discovery of isoxaflutole (IFT), focusing on the chemical and physicochemical properties which contribute to the herbicidal behaviour of this new herbicide. IFT (5-cyclopropyl-1,2-isoxazol-4-yl alpha alpha alpha-trifluoro-2-mesyl-p-tolyl ketone) is a novel herbicide for pre-emergence control of a wide range of important broadleaf and grass weeds in corn and sugarcane. The first benzoyl isoxazole lead was synthesised in 1989 and IFT in 1990, and the herbicidal potential of the latter was identified in 1991. The decision to develop the molecule was taken after two years of field testing in North America. The biochemical target of IFT is 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), inhibition of which leads to a characteristic bleaching of susceptible species. The inhibitor of HPPD is the diketonitrile derivative of IFT formed from opening of the isoxazole ring. The diketonitrile (DKN) is formed rapidly in plants following root and shoot uptake. The DKN is both xylem and phloem mobile leading to high systemicity. IFT also undergoes conversion to the DKN in the soil. The soil half-life of IFT ranges from 12 h to 3 days under laboratory conditions and is dependent on several factors such as soil type, pH and moisture. The log P of IFT is 2.19 and the water solubility is 6.2 mg litre-1, whereas the corresponding values for the DKN are 0.4 and 326 mg litre-1, respectively. These properties restrict the mobility of IFT, which is retained at the soil surface where it can be taken up by surface-germinating weed seeds. The DKN, which has a laboratory soil half-life of 20-30 days, is more mobile and is taken up by the roots. In addition to influencing the soil behaviour of IFT and DKN, the greater lipophilicity of IFT leads to greater uptake by seed, shoot and root tissues. In both plants and soil, the DKN is converted to the herbicidally inactive benzoic acid. This degradation is more rapid in maize than in susceptible weed species and this contributes to the mechanism of selectivity, together with the greater sowing depth of the crop.",Pest management science,"['D015111', 'D001345', 'D019817', 'D001681', 'D002855', 'D004791', 'D006207', 'D006540', 'D007555', 'D015394', 'D010573', 'D018517', 'D018520', 'D010944', 'D012987', 'D012995']","['4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase', 'Autoradiography', 'Benzoic Acid', 'Biological Assay', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Half-Life', 'Herbicides', 'Isoxazoles', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Shoots', 'Plants', 'Soil', 'Solubility']",Isoxaflutole: the background to its discovery and the basis of its herbicidal properties.,"['Q000037', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000032', None]","['antagonists & inhibitors', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11455644,2001

11417641,"The statistical distribution known as the compound gamma function was studied for suitability in describing the distribution of sample test results associated with testing lots of shelled corn for fumonisin. Thirty-two 1.1 kg test samples were taken from each of 16 contaminated lots of shelled corn. An observed distribution consisted of 32 sample fumonisin test results for each lot. The mean fumonisin concentration, c, and the variance, s2, among the 32 sample fumonisin test results along with the parameters for the compound gamma function were determined for each of the 16 observed distributions. The 16 observed distributions of sample fumonisin test results were compared with the compound gamma function using the Power Divergence test. The null hypothesis that the observed distribution could have resulted from sampling a family of compound gamma distributions was not rejected at the 5% significance level for 15 of the 16 lots studied. Parameters of the compound gamma distribution were calculated from the 32-fumonisin sample test results using the method of moments.

FB(1) and hydrolyzed FB(1) (HFB(1)) concentrations in four lots of corn and in the masa, other intermediates, liquid and waste byproducts, and fried chips were determined by HPLC. FB(1) concentrations in the masa and chips were reduced significantly, up to 80% in the fried chips, compared to that in the raw corn. HFB(1) was also found in the masa and chips, but at low concentrations compared to FB(1). LC-MS analyses corroborated HPLC findings and further showed the presence of partially hydrolyzed FB(1) (PHFB(1)), which, like HFB(1), was formed during the nixtamalization (cooking/steeping the corn in alkaline water to make masa) step and found predominantly in the cooking/steeping liquid and solid waste. No significant amounts of N-(carboxymethyl)-FB(1) or N-(1-deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-FB(1), indicative of fumonisin-sugar adduct formation, were found.

A new HPLC procedure using fluorescence detection prior derivatisation with coumarin-3-carbonyl chloride has been also tested. Five extraction solvents and two solid-phase extraction cartridges (silica, Florisil) plus a especial clean-up column (MycoSep 225) were compared in order to obtain the best recovery of the mycotoxins with minimal presence of coextractives in the chromatograms. The chosen extraction solvent was a mixture of acetonitrile-water (84:16, v/v). The MycoSep 225 column was chosen as the best alternative for clean-up of grain samples. For GC-ECD analysis, derivatisation of analytes with heptafluorobutyric anhydride prior the final determination was chosen as the most suitable procedure. HPLC-photodiode array (at 221 nm) analysis was more suitable for determination of type B trichothecenes than HPLC of the fluorescent coumarin-3-carbonyl derivatives.

11389668,"Lipases are widely distributed enzymes that can be obtained from animals, plants and micro-organisms. Coupling lipases with a wide range of substrates allows the opportunity for synthesis of optically pure pharmaceutical preparations, flavour compounds and other food additives. Affinity chromatography owes its power as a purification method to specific biological interactions. Response-surface analysis was chosen to study column efficiency. This method allows the understanding of interactions between variables with advantages over conventional methods, which involve changing one variable while fixing others at certain levels. The aim of this work was to study the influence of the ratio bed height/column diameter (L/D) and superficial velocity (V) on the column efficiency. The experimental design involved the two variables, L/D (2-10) and v (1-2 cm/min), at five levels. Lipase was obtained from Geotrichum sp. culture in a complex medium composed of 5% corn-steep liquor, 0.5% NH(4)NO(3) and 1% olive oil at 30 degrees C, with 1VVM (air volume/medium volume per min) aeration and 400 rev./min agitation. Maximum lipase activity was 19 units/ml after almost 9 h of fermentation. This lipase could potentially be used in esterification reactions to increase the content of gamma-linolenic acid and to produce bioaromas for food industries. The adsorption assays were carried out in a fixed-bed column with an affinity adsorbent, which was obtained by reaction of a gel with oleic acid as ligand. Breakthrough curves were obtained for all experiments. It has been shown that the lower the values of both L/D and v, the higher the column efficiency (maximum 65.43%). Also, it was observed from the response surface that the efficiency reached a minimum at an L/D of around 8.",Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,"['D000327', 'D002846', 'D005848', 'D007218', 'D008049', 'D019301']","['Adsorption', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Geotrichum', 'Industrial Microbiology', 'Lipase', 'Oleic Acid']",Studies on lipase-affinity adsorption using response-surface analysis.,"[None, 'Q000295', 'Q000378', 'Q000295', 'Q000302', 'Q000378']","[None, 'instrumentation', 'metabolism', 'instrumentation', 'isolation & purification', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11389668,2001

In model experiments corn grits were spiked with FB(1) (2 mg/kg) and D-glucose (50 g/kg) or sucrose (50 g/kg) and manufactured into extrusion products at various temperatures (160--180 degrees C) and moisture levels (16--20%). A liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry method using isotopically labeled fumonisin FB(1)-d(6) as an internal standard was developed for the determination of NCM-FB(1). For sample cleanup solid-phase C18 cartridges were used. The detection limit achieved with this method was 10 ng/g (signal-noise ratio = 3:1) using the protonated molecule [M + H](+) signal of NCM-FB(1) (m/z 780) in the selected ion monitoring mode. Low concentrations of NCM-FB(1) (29-97 ng/g) were detected in all samples spiked with D-glucose and FB(1), whereas those spiked with FB(1) and sucrose showed only NCM-FB(1) in samples produced at 180 degrees C (NCM-FB(1) = 27 ng/g). Various corn-containing food samples from the German market were analyzed for the presence of NCM-FB(1), FB(1), and hydrolyzed fumonisin B(1) (HFB(1)).

Eight different sample types were distributed to the participants, 'blank' materials, spiked samples (102 microg/kg ZON in maize and 475 microg/kg DON in wheat) and naturally-contaminated maize and wheat. For the final separation and quantification either gas chromatography (GC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) or enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were employed by the participating laboratories. Coefficients of variation (CV) between laboratory mean results (outliers rejected) ranged from 28 to 41% for ZON and from 32 to 38% for DON. The results are close to the between laboratory CV criteria of 40% for DON and ZON at concentration levels of >100 microg/kg established by the CEN in 1999. A good trueness was obtained for the wheat samples spiked at 475 microg/kg DON. However, a significant deviation at p = 0.01 from the respective target value was observed for the maize samples spiked at 102 microg/kg ZON.

The objectives of this study were to (1) develop a liquid chromatographic method sufficiently sensitive to determine the low concentration of free Sa in male human urine, and (2) analyse So and Sa in human urine and monitor the Sa/So ratio in urine of humans exposed to FB1 in corn diets over 1 month. The liquid chromatographic method involved isolation from human urine of exfoliated cells followed by an extraction of free sphingoid bases and their separation and quantification by high performance liquid chromatography. The detection limits for So and Sa were 0.15 ng/ml in female urine (2 ml used) and 0.005 ng/ ml in male urine (60 ml used). Twenty-eight healthy adult volunteers consumed for 1 month a normal diet containing their homegrown corn potentially contaminated with FB1. Immediately preceding the start of the test, morning urine samples for the determination of So and Sa were collected from each person, and the corn samples used in cooking were obtained from each family for the determination of FB1. At the end of the test period, morning-urine samples were collected from each person and analysed again.

The working group members concluded that, at that time point, it was not possible to carry out a complete risk assessment. However, it was recommended that the human daily' intake of fumonisins should be less than 1 microg/kg bw/day. Subsequently, the presence of the Fusarium mycotoxins fumonisin B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2) in corn-based food on the Danish retail market has been determined. A total of 70 samples were analysed and 37% contained FB1 and 21% contained FB2. No fumonisins were found in sweet corn (canned or frozen), corn-on-the-cob, corn starch or gruel powder for babies. FB1 was found in about half of the corn flakes, corn snack and popcorn (not popped) samples, whereas FB2 was seen to a lesser extent. Both FB1 and FB2 were found in 75% or more of the corn flour, tacos and polenta samples.

A method of extracting phytate through the soaking of pounded maize was developed, and found to reduce phytate content to 49% of unrefined maize. An educational program was used to teach the processing method to mothers of children receiving complementary foods in rural Malawian communities. Samples of maize flour prepared by this process by participants were collected and analysed for phytate and zinc content. Of these, 70% of samples were found to be adequately prepared; mean phytate content of these samples was 48% of unprocessed, unrefined maize flour controls. Most participants found the cooked product to have an acceptable taste (99%) and texture (68%), and felt the processing method took little or no extra time (86%) and was culturally acceptable (96%). The phytate and zinc content of the processed maize flour samples analysed from community prepared samples was substituted into the dietary analysis of complementary foods for 9- to 11-month-old children (n = 31).

11029710,"Proteins that interact with the actin cytoskeleton often modulate the dynamics or organization of the cytoskeleton or use the cytoskeleton to control their localization. In plants, very few actin-binding proteins have been identified and most are thought to modulate cytoskeleton function. To identify actin-binding proteins that are unique to plants, the development of new biochemical procedures will be critical. Affinity columns using actin monomers (globular actin, G-actin) or actin filaments (filamentous actin, F-actin) have been used to identify actin-binding proteins from a wide variety of organisms. Monomeric actin from zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) hypocotyl tissue was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and shown to be native and competent for polymerization to actin filaments. G-actin, F-actin and bovine serum albumin affinity columns were prepared and used to separate samples enriched in either soluble or membrane-associated actin-binding proteins. Extracts of soluble actin-binding proteins yield distinct patterns when eluted from the G-actin and F-actin columns, respectively, leading to the identification of a putative F-actin-binding protein of approximately 40 kDa. When plasma membrane-associated proteins were applied to these columns, two abundant polypeptides eluted selectively from the F-actin column and cross-reacted with antiserum against pea annexins. Additionally, a protein that binds auxin transport inhibitors, the naphthylphthalamic acid binding protein, which has been previously suggested to associate with the actin cytoskeleton, was eluted in a single peak from the F-actin column.

Isolates of Fusarium fungi from an area of South Africa with high incidence of esophageal cancer have been shown to induce esophageal and liver cancer in rats. Several isolates of Fusarium fungi were grown on corn to determine if genotoxic products were produced. We report the incubation of methanol extracts of Fusarium verticillioides cultures with DNA in the presence of rat liver fractions (S9) resulted in the formation of a unique DNA adduct that was detected by (32)P-postlabeling. Fusarin C was purified from cultures of Fusarium verticillioides RRC 415, and was not responsible for the formation of the DNA adduct. Treatment of the methanolic extracts with ultraviolet B radiation reduced the fusarin C content in the extract; however, this had no effect on the formation of the DNA adduct following incubation of the extract with DNA and S9. The unique DNA adduct was formed following the incubation of several Fusarium verticillioides isolates from the US and South Africa, while extracts of cultures of Fusarium graminearium and Fusarium sacchari isolates formed very little of the DNA adduct when incubated with DNA and S9.

Nine gram-positive bacterial strains able to use this herbicide as a sole source of nitrogen were isolated from four farms in central Canada. The strains were divided into two groups based on repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-PCR genomic fingerprinting with ERIC and BOXA1R primers. Based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis, both groups were identified as Nocardioides sp. strains. None of the isolates mineralized [ring-U-(14)C]atrazine. There was no hybridization to genomic DNA from these strains using atzABC cloned from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP or trzA cloned from Rhodococcus corallinus. S-Triazine degradation was studied in detail in Nocardioides sp. strain C190. Oxygen was not required for atrazine degradation by whole cells or cell extracts. Based on high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analyses of products formed from atrazine in incubations of whole cells with H(2)(18)O, sequential hydrolytic reactions converted atrazine to hydroxyatrazine and then to the end product N-ethylammelide. Isopropylamine, the putative product of the second hydrolytic reaction, supported growth as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. The triazine hydrolase from strain C190 was isolated and purified and found to have a K(m) for atrazine of 25 microM and a V(max) of 31 micromol/min/mg of protein. The subunit molecular mass of the protein was 52 kDa. Atrazine hydrolysis was not inhibited by 500 microM EDTA but was inhibited by 100 microM Mg, Cu, Co, or Zn. Whole cells and purified triazine hydrolase converted a range of chlorine or methylthio-substituted herbicides to the corresponding hydroxy derivatives.

Retention was found to be greater after a specific thermal treatment. As checked by DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) and DMTA (dynamic mechanical and thermal analysis), the observed changes are believed to be related to the glass transition of the starch.

All samples were analyzed for fungal infection and aflatoxin B1. Mycological analysis of corn genotypes showed the presence of three principal genera of filamentous fungi Fusarium (100%), Penicillium (67%) and Aspergillus (60%). In the genus Fusarium three species were identified, F. moniliforme (42%), F. nygamai (56%) and F. proliferatum (1.8%). Eight species of Penicillium were identified, the predominant species isolated were P. minioluteum, P. funiculosum and P. variabile. In the genus ranked third in isolation frequency, two species were identified, A. flavus and A. parasiticus, the percentage of infection was 78% and 21%, respectively. Only one corn genotype was contaminated with aflatoxin B1 at a level of 5 ppb. The corn meal samples showed great differences in fungal contamination, the values ranging from 1 x 10(1) to 7 x 10(5) cfu g-1. Fusarium (68%), Aspergillus (35%) and Penicillium (21%) were the most frequent genera isolated. Among the genus, Aspergillus, A. parasiticus (38%) was the most frequent species isolated.

Published methods when applied to syrups spiked with fumonisins gave low recoveries, less than 50%. A method was therefore developed which would be applicable to the syrup and breakfast cereals as well. Test samples were extracted with methanol-0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH3) (1 + 1). The extract was diluted with water and applied to a 1 g C18 column. The column was washed with acetonitrile-water (2 + 8). Fumonisin B1 (FB1) was eluted with acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid (1000 + 1). The purified extract was evaporated and the toxin was derivatized with ophthaldialdehyde mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixture was resolved on a C18 liquid chromatographic column using acetonitrile-water-acetic acid (500 + 550 + 10.5) as the mobile phase at 37 degrees C, and FB1 measured with a fluorescence detector (excitation 335 nm, emission 440 nm). Recoveries of FB1 added to samples of sorghum syrup at levels ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 microgram/g were 94-132%. Recoveries of FB1 added to samples of breakfast cereal (corn flakes) at levels ranging from 0.2 to 1.6 micrograms/g were 96-100%. The method was applied to the analysis of 35 samples of sorghum syrup collected from 15 states in the US. One sample was found to contain FB1 at 0.12 microgram/g. A total of 32 samples of breakfast cereals collected by the Food and Drug Administration inspectors from grocery stores around the Kansas City area were analysed; no FB1 was found in the breakfast cereals (< 0.01 microgram/g).

Diets were total mixed ration containing 47% corn silage and 53% concentrate (dry matter basis) and were supplemented with no added fat (control), or with 3.5% added fat from either higholeic canola oil, a commercial source of oleamide, or oleamide synthesized from oleic acid and urea. The canola oil supplement had no effect on milk yield or composition. Compared to canola oil, the oleamide supplements reduced milk yield, dry matter intake, and milk fat and protein contents. Milk oleic acid concentration increased from 17.4% of total fatty acids for the control diet to 22.1% for the canola oil diet. Both oleamides further increased milk oleic acid to 30.0 and 27.1% of total fatty acids for the commercial and synthesized oleamides, respectively.

The residue was redissolved in acetonitrile and analyzed for ZEN. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of aliquots indicated a rapid degradation and decline in parent ZEN level with increasing time of ozone treatment. The acetonitrile solution containing the degraded ZEN residue was added to a known volume of corn oil and evaporated under nitrogen to eliminate the acetonitrile in the oil. Eighteen-day-old prepubertal female mice (B6C3F1 strain) were gavaged daily with the test chemicals in 50 microl of corn oil between d 18 and 23. Initial dose-response studies showed that a concentration of 60 microg ZEN/mouse/d produced uterine weights that were significantly higher than the uterine weights of control animals (2.7 times higher than that of the solvent control). Treatment groups for the ozonation study included: DES, 0.1 microg (positive control), untreated ZEN (60 microg), extraction control for ZEN (60 microg), 0.5 min ozone-treated ZEN (60 microg), 5 min ozone-treated ZEN (60 microg), solvent control (50 microl), and absolute control. Results showed the uterine weights of animals receiving the ozone-treated ZEN were not significantly affected. These findings were in agreement with HPLC analyses and suggested that ozone can prevent the estrogenic effects of this important mycotoxin in mice.

Nine large PVC lysimeters, 1 m long x 0.45 m diameter, were packed with a sandy soil. Three water table management treatments, i.e. two subirrigation treatments with constant water table depths of 0.4 and 0.8 m, respectively, and a free drainage treatment in a completely randomized design with three replicates were used. Corn (Zea mays L.) was grown in each lysimeter, and at the beginning of summer of each year metolachlor was applied, at the locally recommended rate of 2.75 kg a.i./ha. Soil and water samples were collected at different time intervals after each natural or simulated rainfall event. Metolachlor was extracted from these samples and analyzed using Gas Chromatography. Results obtained in this three year study, (1993-1995), lead to the conclusion that metolachlor is quite mobile since it leached to a depth of 0.85 m below the soil surface quite early in the growing season. Metolachlor concentrations decreased with depth as well as with time. The shallower water table in the 0.4 m subirrigation treatment showed less residues in the soil solution than that of other treatments.

Current studies revealed that heat treatment (over the range of 100-175 degrees C) of corn fiber in either a convection oven or a vacuum oven caused only a modest reduction in the levels of the phytosterol components. However, these same heat pretreatments caused a considerable increase (up to 10-fold) in the levels (increasing from 0.34 wt % to a maximum of 3.64 wt % gamma-tocopherol in the oil) and yields (increasing from 5.4 mg of gamma-tocopherol/100 g of corn fiber to a maximum of 52.1 mg of gamma-tocopherol/100 g of corn fiber) of gamma-tocopherol in corn fiber oil. The main differences between the convection oven and vacuum oven pretreatments were associated with the disappearance of free fatty acids and free phytosterols at the higher temperature pretreatments in the vacuum oven, probably due to the lower boiling points of these lipids.

The extract was added to an LLE cartridge containing a diatomaceous-earth adsorbant, previously impregnated with sodium bicarbonate solution. After aspiration to dryness, the cartridge was eluted with methanol-water (4 + 1), and aliquots were taken for quantitation by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Recoveries of citrinin added to ground corn at 200-1600 ng/g ranged from 71.2 to 86.3%, with coefficients of variation between 4.1 and 10.6%. An indirect enzyme immunoassay was also evaluated, using sodium carbonate solution for extraction. Recoveries of citrinin added to ground corn at 200-2000 ng/g ranged from 53.2 to 67.2%, but the coefficients of variation varied between 18.4 and 51.5%.

10571986,"Plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are soluble proteins which are characterized by their in vitro ability to transfer phospholipids between two membranes. We have compared the functional properties of two LTPs purified from maize and wheat seeds knowing that, despite a high degree of sequence identity, the two proteins exhibit structural differences. It was found that wheat LTP had a lower transfer activity than the maize LTP, consistent with a lower kinetics of fatty acid binding. The lower affinity for the fatty acids of the wheat LTP could be explained by a narrowing occurring in the middle part of the binding site, as revealed by comparing the fluorescence spectra of various anthroyloxy-labeled fatty acids associated with the two LTPs. The affinity for some natural fatty acids was studied by competition with fluorescent fatty acids toward binding to the protein. Again, wheat LTP had a lower affinity for those molecules. All together, these observations reveal the complexity of the LTP family in plants, probably reflecting the multiple roles played by these proteins.",Biochemistry,"['D052179', 'D001665', 'D001692', 'D002352', 'D005456', 'D007850', 'D050356', 'D008958', 'D010940', 'D012639', 'D013050', 'D013229', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Antigens, Plant', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Lauric Acids', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Plant Proteins', 'Seeds', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Stearic Acids', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Comparison of lipid binding and transfer properties of two lipid transfer proteins from plants.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10571986,1999

The number of ears visibly infected with Fusarium spp. ranged from less than 5% to 25% in some fields. Infection typically occurred at the tassel end of the ears. Fusarium graminearum was isolated from surface disinfected kernels, both those which were visibly infected and those kernels which appeared disease-free in an area up to 5 cm from the edge of the visibly moulded areas. Infected ears were cut into four sections and the kernels only were analysed for deoxynivalenol (DON) using liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry/gas chromatography (GC/MS). Kernels from the visibly mouldy area of the ears contained DON at levels of approximately 446 mg/g DON on average; whereas in the non-visibly infected portion of the ears adjacent to the mouldy tips, DON levels averaged approximately 10 mg/g.

Fume samples from six different commercial cooking oils (safflower, olive, coconut, mustard, vegetable, and corn) frequently used in Taiwan were collected. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were extracted from the air samples and identified by high-performance liquid chromatography and confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Extracts of fumes from safflower oil, vegetable oil, and corn oil contained benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DBahA), benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbFA), and benzo[a]anthracene (BaA). Concentrations of BaP, DbahA, BbFA, and BaA were 2.1, 2.8, 1.8, and 2.5 microg/m3 in fumes from safflower oil; 2.7, 3.2, 2.6, and 2.1 microg/m3 in vegetable oil; and 2.6, 2.4, 2.0, and 1.9 microg/m3 in corn oil, respectively. The authors constructed models to study the efficacy of table-edged fume extractors used commonly by Taiwanese restaurants. Concentrations of BaP were significantly decreased when the fume extractor was working (P<0.05) and the average reduction in percentage was 75%. The other identified PAHs were undetected.

Most of the naturally contaminated samples were analyzed using the extraction solvent mixtures methanol-acetonitrile-water (25:25:50) (solvent A) and methanol-water (75:25 or 80:20) (solvents B, BB); some were extracted with 0.1 M sodium hydrogen phosphate-acetonitrile (1:1, adjusted to pH 3.0 with o-phosphoric acid) (solvent C) and methanol-0.025 M borate buffer (3:1, adjusted to pH 9.2 with 1 N sodium hydroxide) (solvent D).

This study addresses several processing and protein recovery issues that are relevant to utilizing transgenic corn as a protein production system. The gus gene coding for beta-glucuronidase (rGUS) was stably integrated and expressed over four generations. The accumulation level of rGUS reached 0.4% of total extractable protein. Within the kernel, rGUS was preferentially accumulated in the germ even though a constitutive ubiquitin promoter was used to direct gus expression. Fourth-generation transgenic seed was used to investigate the effect of seed processing on the activity and the recovery of rGUS. Transgenic seed containing rGUS could be stored at an ambient temperature for up to two weeks and for at least three months at 10 degrees C without a significant loss of enzyme activity. rGUS exposed to dry heat was more stable in ground than in whole kernels. The enzyme stability was correlated with the moisture loss of the samples during the heating. Transgenic seed was dry-milled, fractionated, and hexane extracted to produce full-fat and defatted germ fractions. The results of the aqueous extraction of rGUS from ground kernels, full-fat germ, and defatted-germ samples revealed that approximately 10 times more rGUS per gram of solids could be extracted from the ground full-fat germ and defatted-germ than from the kernel samples. The extraction of corn oil from ground germ with hot hexane (60 degrees C) did not affect the extractable rGUS activity. rGUS was purified from ground kernels and full-fat germ extracts by ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatography.

This detection can be accomplished quickly, precisely and accurately in a two-step chromatographic process. In the first step, fumonisins are extracted from a sample and isolated on an immunoaffinity column. In the second step, fumonisins are converted to fluorescent derivatives and quantified either through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or by fluorometer. These methods offer significant improvements in performance compared to earlier technology: limits of detection as low as 0.016 micrograms/g with HPLC-based detection and 0.25 micrograms/g for fluorometer-based detection; greater assay linearity (with HPLC, r = 0.997; with fluorometer, r = 0.998); larger immunoaffinity column capacity (77% recovery at 12.5 micrograms) and extended assay range (0-10 micrograms/g) for methods.

Precision studies were performed for both the fluorometer and the HPLC methods. The average coefficient of variation was 14% for the fluorometer method and 8.3% for the HPLC method.

The method may be used to demonstrate compliance with the guidelines of the U.S. Nutrition Labeling and Education Act for labeling products as ""fat free"" or ""low fat."" The method can measure total and saturated fat in savory snacks when present at levels of 0.2-10 g total fat and 0.1-3 g saturated fat per 30 g serving. The method is standardized to measure C6-C24 fatty acids. Extraction of olestra-containing savory snack samples with chloroform-methanol (modified AOAC Official Method 983.23) yields a lipid extract containing the total fat and olestra. The extracted lipid is hydrolyzed by lipase, yielding fatty acids and unreacted olestra. The fatty acids are precipitated as calcium soaps. Olestra is extracted from insoluble soaps with hexane and then discarded. The isolated soaps are converted back into fatty acids with hydrochloric acid and extracted with hexane. The isolated fatty acids are converted to methyl esters with boron trifluoride-methanol and quantitated by capillary gas chromatography using internal standard. Test samples were prepared by blending olestra-containing and full-fat (triglyceride) snacks to obtain 6 levels of spiking (0-10 g total fat added/30 g serving) in potato chips, potato crisps, cheese puffs, and nacho cheese-flavored corn chips. Results were linear (r2 > 0.997) between 0 and 10 g fat/30 g serving for each product matrix. Mean recovery was 101 +/- 6% standard deviation (SD) for total fat and 104 +/- 6% SD for saturated fat. Mean recovery by peer laboratory was 88 +/- 5% SD for total fat and 95 +/- 4% SD for saturated fat in potato chips (0-3 g total fat added/30 g serving). Two sets of 10 replicates of potato chips (0.5 g total fat/30 g serving and 0.16 g saturated fat/30 g serving) and potato crisps (0.5 g total fat/30 g serving and 0.16 g saturated fat/30 g serving) were analyzed by submitting and peer laboratories. Repeatability relative standard deviations ranged from 3.90 to 7.33% for total fat and from 4.01 to 11.53% for saturated fat. Reproducibility relative standard deviations were 7.33% (total fat, potato chips), 7.15% (total fat, potato crisps), 11.36% (saturated fat, potato chips), and 13.50% (saturated fat, potato crisps).",Journal of AOAC International,"['D004041', 'D019358', 'D005227', 'D005504', 'D007202', 'D011786', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D011198', 'D013395']","['Dietary Fats', 'Fat Substitutes', 'Fatty Acids', 'Food Analysis', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Quality Control', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Sucrose']",Determination of fat in olestra-containing savory snack products by capillary gas chromatography.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000031']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analogs & derivatives']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9680711,1998

Fumonisins causes leukoencephalomalacia in horses and pulmonary edema in swine and have been suggested as a possible cause of an increased incidence of neural tube defects among people living along the Texas-Mexico border. As part of an effort to determine levels of fumonisins in human food, a liquid chromatographic (LC) method was devised for determining fumonisin B1 (FB1) and the total hydrolysis product of FB1 (HB1) in tortillas. The method uses acetonitrile-0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 3; 1 + 1) extraction, solid-phase C18 cleanup, o-phthalaldehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol derivatization, and reversed-phase LC. Average recoveries from tortillas spiked with FB1 and HB1 at 250, 500, and 1000 ng/g were 86.5% for FB1 and 82.6% for HB1. Tortillas (54) and masa (8) from the Texas-Mexico border were analyzed for FB1 and HB1. Average amounts of FB1 and HB1 in tortillas were 187 and 82 ng/g, respectively.

Fumonisin B1 was found to occur in 70-73% of the mouldy samples. The mycotoxin level increased from year to year: the highest fumonisin B1 concentration was 75.1 mg/kg. The samples that were mould-free on visual inspection showed a much lower prevalence of fumonisin B1 contamination (30%) and contained fumonisin B1 in markedly lower concentrations (average, 1.52 mg/kg; maximum concentration, 5.1 mg/kg). Using the Fusarium moniliforme strain designated 14/A, isolated from the sample that had the highest mycotoxin concentrations, fumonisin B1 toxin was produced on maize by an internationally accepted procedure. Subsequently, two weaned piglets were fed a diet containing 330 mg fumonisin B1 per kg of feed. The experimental animals developed hydrothorax and pulmonary oedema, and died in 5-6 days. The clinical symptoms and pathological lesions were consistent with those of porcine pulmonary oedema (PPE) diagnosed in the USA in 1989-1990, as well as with those of a disease entity that had already been described in Hungary in the 1950s as the so-called fattening or unique pulmonary oedema of pigs but considered to be of unknown aetiology.

For most of the mycotoxins, recoveries obtained were 60% or greater and reproducibility data were better than +/- 40%. In general, the analysis of maize gluten proved more difficult than for other maize products. In total 40 samples of maize gluten, and 27 samples of other maize products were examined. Aflatoxins were not found above the reporting limit (1-5 micrograms/kg) in any sample while ochratoxin A was detected in only two samples of maize gluten at 2 micrograms/kg. No sterigmatocystin or cyclopiazonic acid were detected although the limits of detection for these toxins were poor. Twenty percent of maize gluten samples contained zearalenone at up to 500 micrograms/kg while all other maize products also contained this mycotoxin. Highest levels occurred in screenings and meal while the lowest amounts were in flaked maize and germ. Many samples contained a multi-toxin mixture of trichothecenes, fumonisins and moniliformin. The most highly contaminated samples of maize screenings and maize meal contained a mixture of zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, fumonisin B1 and B2, moniliformin, each in mg/kg amounts and lower amounts of other trichothecenes such as 15-acetoxy deoxynivalenol, HT-2 toxin and T-2 toxin.

Ten healthy male volunteers ingested 5 g of CP, wheat peptide (WP), pea peptide (PP), alanine, or leucine 30 min before alcohol intake at a dose of 0.5 g/kg, and blood ethanol and plasma amino acid concentrations were measured during a 2-h observation period after alcohol intake. In subjects who ingested CP, the blood ethanol level was lower than that in the WP, alanine and leucine ingestion groups, but did not decrease as compared to the control when they ingested PP. Similarly there was a difference in the blood ethanol level between alanine and leucine ingestion groups, and leucine ingestion was more effective than alanine against the reduction of the increase in blood ethanol level. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the plasma concentrations of individual amino acids except alanine, leucine, or lysine after alcohol intake among experimental groups as compared to the control.

Presently 6 different fumonisins (FB1, FB2, FB3, FB4, FA1 and FA2) have been identified and characterized. In veterinary medicine fumonisins cause equine leucoencephalomalacia and swine pulmonary edema. In addition, fumonisins have been shown to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals and have been linked to human esophageal cancer in South Africa and China. In this study we examined the prevalence of FB1, FB2 and FB3 in corn-based human foods in Kansas using HPLC equipped with a fluorescent detector. All 3 fumonisins were detected in at least 1 food item. However, only 24/121 samples analyzed (20%), contained detectable (> 40 ppb) fumonisins. Corn flour was the most frequently contaminated as 13/25 items (52%) were positive for fumonisins. For all analyzed human foods, the range of fumonisins was 42-350 ppb in comparison to 765-9953 ppb found in corn meant for animal consumption.

Distribution of the three toxins follows a pattern reasonably expected from their physical solubility characteristics. The highly water-soluble mycotoxins, NIV and DON, were found at high concentrations (up to 8.8 mg/kg) in concentrated steep liquor (CSL) fractions, but at low levels (less than 0.3 mg/kg) in the solid (germ, fibre and gluten) fractions. The converse was true for ZEN, which is relatively insoluble in water. For ZEN, the maximum concentration found in CSL was 0.6 mg/kg compared with 2.2-4.8 mg/kg in germ, fibre and gluten fractions. Accordingly, an animal food byproduct composed mainly of pressed fibre and concentrated steep liquor was usually found to contain concentrations of all three mycotoxins above those existing in the input maize. A single sample of corn oil recovered during the study also had a high concentration (4.6 mg/kg) of ZEN.

9135724,"Extracts, isolated through sequential fractionation and partition procedures described previously (Martinez et al. 1994) from aflatoxin-free corn and aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment, were investigated for mutagenic potential using the Ames test (TA 100 tester strain). 2-Aminofluorene (2-AF) and pure aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) were used as positive controls. Although TA100 showed mutagenic response to pure AFB1 at a dose of ca 10 ng/plate, all isolates tested from ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn containing 7500 ng AFB1/g did not exhibit positive results in the Ames test. Additionally, isolates from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-contaminated corn failed to give positive mutagenic potentials. These results indicate that differences between the mutagenic potentials of pure aflatoxins and of aflatoxins in naturally-contaminated corn exist. CH2Cl2 extracts (the fractions containing aflatoxins) obtained from aflatoxin-contaminated corn with and without ammonia treatment were applied to preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) in an effort to separate aflatoxins and/or ammonia/aflatoxin reaction products from the ""unknown interfering materials' existing in the corn matrix. Each of the fractions separated by TLC was tested by the Ames test with S9 activation and none of them gave a mutagenic response to TA100. CH2Cl2 extracts in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) obtained from non-ammonia-treated aflatoxin-free corn were spiked with pure AFB1 and tested by TA100 with S9 activation. Again, no positive responses were observed. These findings provide further evidence of ""unknown interfering materials' in corn which may bind with aflatoxin and/or can be extracted by CH2Cl2 together with aflatoxin, and, therefore, block the mutagenic activity of aflatoxin in the Ames test.

Internal standards consisting of 18O2-labeled analogs of 9- and 13-HODE are added to pulverized frozen tissue prior to extraction with ethanol. Nonlipid materials are removed in a chloroform/methanol/water step. The remaining lipid material is methylated with ethereal diazomethane, and much of the nonoxygenated fatty acid methyl esters are removed via silica solid-phase extraction. Samples are either further derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide to form the trimethylsilyl ethers for quantitative analysis by GC-MS or are analyzed as the methyl esters by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the enantiomeric distribution of the 9- and 13-HODE.

Chiral analysis of the products showed higher production of 13(S)-HODE relative to 13(R)-HODE; the enantiomeric excess is most likely due to enzymatic production of 13-HODE superimposed on a background of autoxidative production of 13(R)- plus 9(S)- and 9(R)-HODE. In addition, the effect of sample handling and storage conditions on the formation of 9- and 13-HODE in the samples was assessed by exposing aliquots of a common pool of rat mammary gland tissue to specified conditions prior to analysis.

The highest frequency of detection and also the highest FB1 concentrations were found in sweetcorn (50%, 1089 ng/g) and cornflour (50%, 608 ng/g), followed by corn snacks (33.3%, 2395 ng/g), miscellaneous corn products (33.3%, 73 ng/g), popcorn (31.8%, 1003 ng/g) and cornflakes (23.5%, 1281 ng/g). 16 corn snacks (= approximately 20.5% of the samples) had an average FB1 and FB2 content of 456 and 145 ng/g, respectively, while six sweetcorn (= 25%) samples were contaminated with an average of 400 ng/g of FB1 and 65 ng/g of FB2. Of the 22 pop-corn samples examined, 7 had an average of 347 ng/g and 116 ng/g of FB1 and FB2, respectively. During an analysis of the distribution pattern for the combined fumonisin levels of FB1 and FB2, it became apparent that more than 69% of tested samples had fumonisin concentrations below 100 ng/g, while 11.1% (or 17 samples) contained in excess of 600 ng toxins per g.

The antimicrobial activity detected in the fermentation supernatant fraction of L. amylovorus LMG P-13139 was heat stable (20 min, 121 degrees C), displayed a narrow inhibitory spectrum, and was sensitive to proteinase K, trypsin, and alpha-chymotrypsin but insensitive to alpha-amylase, lysozyme, catalase, and lipase. The 4.5-kDa bacteriocin was purified and characterized and designated lactobin A. Lactobin A was isolated as a floating pellicle from culture supernatant brought to 35% saturation with ammonium sulfate. Upon this ammonium sulfate treatment, crude lactobin A was incorporated, together with Tween 80 as a major contaminant, in high-molecular-mass complexes sized at approximately 670 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. Contaminating fatty acids were removed from these micelles by a simple one-step methanol-chloroform extraction without loss of activity. Both inhibitory peptides were separated in an isocratic isopropanol gradient on a PepRPC 5/5 reversed-phase column, and both peptides retained activity towards Lactobacillus helveticus ATCC 15009 upon separation. Lactobin A has a molecular mass determined by electrospray mass spectrometry of 4,879 +/- 0.69 Da. Its peptide chain contains 50 unmodified amino acids, of which 26% are glycine residues and 40% are hydrophobic residues (A, V, L, I, and P). It displays the highest structural homology (42% identity and 28% similarity) with the lafX gene product, encoded by the second open reading frame of the lactacin F operon.

9000275,"Two experiments were conducted to investigate the usefulness of a natural golden marine algae (MA) as a poultry ration supplement for the production of shell eggs rich in n-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA). This MA is unique due to a high concentration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n-3) and the absence of other n-3 FA normally present in marine oils such as menhaden oil (MO). In the first experiment, 60 24-wk-old Single Comb White Leghorn (SCWL) hens were divided among four dietary treatments, including a typical corn-soybean control (CON); 1.5% MO, supplying 233 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 155 mg DHA per d; 2.4% MA, supplying 200 mg DHA/d; and 4.8% MA, supplying 400 mg DHA/d. A second experiment using 96 56-wk-old SCWL was conducted using the same diets. In both experiments, eggs were collected weekly for 4 wk for determination of egg production parameters and yolk FA content. Each week, yolk samples were extracted, methyl estered, and quantified using gas chromatography. Transient depression in egg and yolk weights were noted early in Experiment 1 in response to dietary 4.8% MA. Although egg and yolk weights were not affected in Experiment 2, egg production was significantly reduced in the 4.8% MA treatment. Egg production was unaffected due to diet or week in Experiment 1. In both experiments, yolk polyunsaturated profiles were significantly influenced by diet. Dietary n-3 FA supplementation significantly increased yolk total N-3 FA with concomitant reductions in yolk n-6 FA. Although hens fed MO were supplied predominantly EPA, the principal yolk FA deposited was DHA. Marine algae also promoted efficient yolk DHA deposition with the highest yolk DHA concentrations attained in eggs from hens fed 4.8% MA.

Methodology was developed for determination of AP1 in foods manufactured from calcium hydroxide-processed corn. The ground food (tortilla chips, nacho chips, taco shells, or air-dried corn tortillas) was extracted with methanol-water (8:2) or methanol-acetonitrile-water (25:25:50), which also extracted FB1 and fumonisin B2 (FB2). Clean-up for fumonisin determination was carried out on a 1 ml strong anion exchange (SAX) solid phase extraction (SPE) column. The water wash from this column, containing AP1, was cleaned up on a 1 ml C-18 SPE column. AP1 and, separately, FB1 and FB2 were determined as their o-phthaldialdehyde-mercaptoethanol (OPA/MCE) and, in some cases, 4-fluoro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD-F) derivatives by gradient reverse phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Recoveries of AP1, FB1 and FB2 from spiked samples were generally satisfactory, but FB1 and FB2 recoveries were low with some samples. Better recovery of FB1 with the methanol-acetonitrile-water (25:25:50) extraction solvent compared with methanol-water (8:2) was observed for naturally-contaminated samples. Detection limits were about 10 ng AP1 per g and 20 ng FB1 and FB2 per g with OPA/MCE derivatization, but there were interferences for FB2.

Sedimentation velocity analysis indicated that WRP25 and WRP27 are monomeric proteins, whereas WRP24 is a dimer. WRP24 is identical in N-terminal amino acid sequence to the well characterized 0.19 dimeric inhibitor from wheat kernels. WRP25 and WRP26 differ in sequence from each other at only three positions and represent previously unseparated forms of the 0.28 wheat inhibitor. WRP27 is a previously uncharacterized inhibitor and is more similar in sequence to the 0.28 inhibitor than to the 0.19 inhibitor. WRP25 and WRP26 inhibited alpha-amylases from the rice weevil, red flour beetle, and the yellow meal worm, but did not inhibit human salivary alpha-amylase. WRP24 inhibited the human as well as the insect alpha-amylases, but inhibited one of the two rice weevil alpha-amylases much more strongly than the other. WRP27 was notable in that, of the enzymes tested, it strongly inhibited only the rice weevil alpha-amylases.

A small portion (5.1%) of the samples was found to be contaminated with high levels ( > 1 microgram/g) of type A TCTCs and total DON during the whole survey. Over 40% of the samples had 100 to 1,000 ng of total DON per g, while 17% of the samples had the same levels of type A TCTCs. The analytical data were consistent with those from mycological examinations for the samples in which various toxic Fusarium spp., including F. sporotrichioides, F. poae, and F. graminearum, were found. The samples received in November 1992 had relatively low concentrations of toxin; the average levels of type A TCTCs and total DON were 9.9 and 79 ng/g, respectively. The toxin concentrations became progressively higher in the samples received in December. The average levels for the type A TCTCs and total DON increased to 920 and 335 ng/g, respectively. However, the levels of ZE were higher in the samples collected earlier. The average levels for samples collected in November and late December were 1,195 and 242 ng/g, respectively. Analysis of selected samples by high-performance liquid chromatography monitoring with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol, neosolaniol, and T-2 tetraol (T-2-4ol) were common in these samples. Statistical analysis revealed a weak correlation between the levels of total type A TCTCs and total DON in the samples (r = 0.18, P = 0.09), but a strong correlation between the levels of ZE and total type B TCTCs (r = 0.75, P < 0.0001) was found.

Specific antibodies against T-2 toxin were used in an RIA for analysis of T-2 toxin alone. Analytical recoveries of T-2 toxin analyzed as T-2-4ol-4Ac by ELISA and T-2 toxin by RIA at 10-200 ppb were 83.5-123% and 81.8-110.6%, respectively. T-2 toxin accounts for about 30% of total type A TCTCs by both liquid chromatography (LC)-ELISA and RIA methods. The correlation coefficients (r) of total type A TCTC levels versus T-2 toxin level by RIA was 0.725 (p < 0.0001).

Of the mouldy maize samples collected in the period of storage, 70.8% contained fumonisin B1 (0.05-19.8 mg/kg; average concentration: 2.6 mg/kg), 87.5% contained zearalenone (0.01-11.8 mg/kg, average concentration: 1.26 mg/kg), 70% contained deoxynivalenol (0.07-21.2, average concentration: 4.33 mg/kg), and 41.7% contained T-2 toxin (0.06-0.39, average concentration: 0.2 mg/kg). These mycotoxins often occurred together in the samples. In the non-mouldy samples, both the positivity rate and the mycotoxin concentration were markedly lower. In the harvesting period, the mycotoxin content of maize ears more or less affected by moulds (so-called ""affected sample"") and of the average sample was determined separately for each maize-field involved in the study. Of the affected samples, 70% contained fumonisin B1 (0.095-52.4 mg/kg; average: 6.64 mg/kg), 17% contained zearalenone (0.006-0.079 mg/kg; average: 0.03 mg/kg), 13% contained deoxynivalenol (0.05-0.118 mg/kg; average: 0.09 mg/kg), and 39% contained T-2 toxin (0.05-0.551 mg/kg; average: 0.165 mg/kg).

The results call attention to the fact that maize cultivated in Hungary is often contaminated with fumonisin B1. High concentrations of fumonisin B1 were found primarily in the mouldy or affected maize ears; therefore, the development of diseases caused by fumonisin B1 should be reckoned with primarily if such maize is fed. Besides fumonisin B1, mouldy or affected maize usually contains also other fusariotoxins, which raises the possibility of mycotoxin interactions. Because of the high prevalence of fumonisin B1 in maize grown in Hungary, the authors suggest that samples of maize used for feeding horses and pigs should be checked for fumonisin B1 content.",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,"['D005506', 'D037341', 'D006814', 'D009183', 'D003313']","['Food Contamination', 'Fumonisins', 'Hungary', 'Mycotoxins', 'Zea mays']",Data on the contamination of maize with fumonisin B1 and other fusariotoxins in Hungary.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8826699,1996

Barrows were treated daily with buffer or porcine somatotropin (100 micrograms/kg body wt) when they weighed between 30 and 64 kg (eight pigs/group). Pigs were restrictively fed so that the average food intake was 1.86 kg/d. The corn-soybean meal-skim milk-based diet contained 18% crude protein and 1.2% lysine, and was designed to meet muscle amino acid ratio profile with respect to lysine as the first limiting amino acid for growth. Tissue levels of eighteen amino acids were determined on lyophilized samples that were appropriately hydrolyzed and analyzed by HPLC. The concentrations (mg/g dry wt) of all amino acids were greater in carcass, skin, head and empty body of porcine somatotropin-treated pigs; amino acid concentration in viscera was not influenced by porcine somatotropin. However, when the concentration of each amino acid was expressed on a per unit protein basis, the amino acid profiles of control and porcine somatotropin-treated pigs were quite similar. The average deposition rate of each amino acid was increased approximately 67% by porcine somatotropin. When the deposition of each amino acid was calculated in relation to lysine, however, the pattern of amino acid utilization for growth was similar for control and porcine somatotropin-treated pigs; exceptions were arginine, glycine and tryptophan. The ratio of indispensable to dispensable amino acids that were deposited was also similar for control and porcine somatotropin-treated pigs.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g) were administered corn oil or the following EBIFs: propiconazole (400 mg/kg/day), vinclozolin (400 mg/kg/day), clotrimazole (100 mg/kg/day), or ketoconazole (100 mg/kg/day) for 3 days by oral gavage. Forty-eight hours following the final dose, a single bolus of parathion (0.4 mg/kg in corn oil) or malathion (150 mg/kg in corn oil) or corn oil alone was given po. The rats were terminated 12 hr following parathion or 4 hr following malathion dosing. Significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of BChE was observed with parathion and malathion only following clotrimazole treatment. In contrast, when a similar experiment was performed in bobwhite quail dosed with 12 mg/kg malathion following EBIF treatment, significant BChE inhibition was observed following treatment with vinclozolin or ketoconazole, but not with propiconazole or clotrimazole. Induction of cytochrome P450 in rat and quail liver by EBIFs was accompanied by enhanced oxidative desulfuration of malathion, parathion, and diazinon to toxic oxon products. Increased detoxication via oxidative dearylation/esterolytic clevage also occurred. However, while enhanced acute in vivo insecticide toxicity was observed in both species with a number of EBIF-phosphorothioate combinations, EBIF-induced oxidative activation of phosphorothioates by liver microsomes in vitro was not a good predictor of this effect.",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,"['D000284', 'D000818', 'D002091', 'D002851', 'D003088', 'D004347', 'D004875', 'D005659', 'D007306', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D009946', 'D011897', 'D051381', 'D017207']","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Butyrylcholinesterase', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colinus', 'Drug Interactions', 'Ergosterol', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Insecticides', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Organothiophosphorus Compounds', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",Toxic interactions between fungicides that inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis and phosphorothioate insecticides in the male rat and bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus).,"[None, None, 'Q000097', None, None, None, 'Q000096', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'blood', None, None, None, 'biosynthesis', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7871535,1995

7542129,"Fusaric acid is produced by several species of Fusarium, which commonly infect corn and other agricultural commodities. Since this mycotoxin may augment the effects of other Fusarium toxins, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method of analysis in feeds was developed. Fusaric acid was analyzed as the trimethylsilyl-ester from F. moniliforme-cultures, -contaminated corn screenings, and feeds toxic to livestock. The mycotoxin was found in all samples and ranged from 0.43 to 12.39 micrograms/g sample. Also, fusaric acid was tested for its neurochemical effects in the brain and pineal gland of rats. Animals were dosed intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg body weight) 30 min prior to the onset of the dark phase (lights out) and the effects were studied at 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5 h after treatment. Brain serotonin (5HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), tyrosine (TYRO), and dopamine (DA) were increased (P < 0.05) by fusaric acid, and norepinephrine (NEpi) was decreased (P < 0.05). Analogously, DA in the pineal gland increased and NEpi decreased (P < 0.05). Pineal N-acetylserotonin (NAc5HT) was increased (P < 0.05), whereas pineal 5HT and its two major metabolites 5HIAA and 5-hydroxytryptophol (5HTOL) decreased (P < 0.05). Elevated brain TYRO and brain and pineal DA, with decreased NEpi, may be consistent with fusaric acid's partial inhibitory effect on tyrosine-hydroxylase and its inhibitory effect on dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, respectively. Elevated pineal Nac5HT is consistent with decreased pineal 5HT and the increased pineal DA, and support the dopaminergic stimulatory activity of the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 5HT to NAc5HT. This is the first report of fusaric acid's in vivo effect on pineal DA, NEpi, 5HT, and NAc5HT in rats, and a relation for the effects on TYRO, 5HT, and 5HIAA in brain tissue.

Oligosaccharide analysis of these samples either by liquid chromatography or by capillary gas chromatography yielded oligosaccharide patterns that were useful for the detection of these sweeteners at 10% levels.

Two sets of samples, one from the points of origin in South Africa prior to shipment, and the other from the end-point distributors in Taiwan, were studied. Surface-sterilized kernels were plated onto two different agar media and the fungal colonies identified. High Performance Liquid Chromatography was used to analyze mycotoxin levels. The predominant ear-rot fungi, in decreasing order of isolation frequency, were Fusarium subglutinans, F. moniliforme, Diploidia maydis and F. graminearum. Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus were not isolated from samples prior to export, but a small number of A. flavus isolates were found after shipment. The predominant mycotoxins were fumonisins B1 (0-865 ng/g) and B2 (0-250 ng/g). Low levels of moniliformin (< or = 390 ng/g) were detected in some samples before shipment. Zearalenone (25 ng/g), and nivalenol (120 ng/g) were detected in two out of 32 samples taken in Taiwan.

Comparative values are given from a background area, namely a domestic garden located in the North Yorkshire Dales National Park area. Analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quality control assessment using four international biological reference materials; BCR:CRM 62 Olive Leaves, NIST 1575 Pine Needles, NIST 1573 Tomato Leaves, and NIST 1572 Citrus Leaves. Inter-analytical method comparison is given using two methods of ICP-MS; namely conventional pneumatic nebulisation of sample solution, and direct solids analysis by laser ablation; and neutron activation analysis methods (NAA). For the elements listed there is a good precision obtained by ICP-MS and NAA. In particular levels of < +/- 1-10% (rsd) are obtained. Comparison of data with certified values and other analytical methods are generally of very good agreement. Lead levels in background areas ranged from 0.0008 to 0.340 microgram/g (fresh weight) for plant material; with the lead magnitude greater for grasses > herbs > vegetables > cereals > fruits. Measured values are in good agreement with reported literature values. The lowest Pb values are for marrow, lettuce, tomato and sweet corn samples (approximately 0.001-0.021 microgram/g). 'Green' leaf material levels were approximately 0.02-0.10 microgram/g (i.e. sprouts and cabbage).

Conjugated linoleic acid occurs naturally in food and is present at higher concentrations in products from ruminant animals. Given that certain rumen microorganisms produce CLA from free linoleic acid, we studied the effect of feeding free or esterified linoleic acid on tissue CLA concentrations using conventional and germ-free rats. Conventional rats were fed a 5% (wt/wt) corn oil control diet alone or supplemented with 5% free linoleic acid or 8.63% corn oil (equivalent to 5% linoleic acid in triglyceride). Germ-free rats were fed autoclavable nonpurified diet alone or supplemented with 5% free linoleic acid. Analyses of CLA concentrations were performed on lipids extracted from liver, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle and abdominal adipose tissue, and on liver phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions. Tissue CLA concentrations were higher in conventional rats fed free linoleic acid (the major isomers were cis-9, trans-11 and trans-9, cis-11) than in control animals. Conjugated linoleic acid concentrations in free linoleic acid-fed rats were maximal at 4 wk, and levels were 5-10 times higher than those of controls. Elevated CLA concentrations were also observed in liver phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions. In contrast, CLA concentrations in the tissues of germ-free rats were not affected by diet.

8407669,"Aflatoxins, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, and their respective metabolites require specific procedures for their determination because of their diverse chemistry and occurrence in complex matrices of feedstuffs and foods. Major sources of error in the analysis of these mycotoxins arise from inadequate sampling and inefficient extraction and cleanup procedures. The determinative step in the assay for each of these toxins is sensitive to levels below those that are considered detrimental to humans and animals. Aflatoxins can be determined in grains and animal fluids and tissues by TLC, HPLC, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and ELISA procedures. Zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin, can readily be determined in cereal grains and foods by HPLC (50 ng/g) and by TLC (300 ng/g). No incurred levels of zearalenone or its metabolites have been detected in animal tissues destined for human consumption. Deoxynivalenol can be determined in wheat and corn at 300 ng/g by a rapid TLC procedure and at 325 ng/g by a GC method. Although not tested collaboratively, an HPLC procedure and an ELISA screening procedure are capable of detecting deoxynivalenol at low (nanograms/gram) levels in feedstuffs and foods. The recently characterized fumonisins can be detected by TLC, HPLC, and GC-MS at levels below those now considered harmful.

8318839,"The precision parameters of the method-performance (collaborative) studies for mycotoxins published in the literature through 1991 have been recalculated on a uniform basis by following the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry protocol. About 80% of the 793 accepted assays for mycotoxins, almost all of which have been conducted by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), liquid chromatography (LC), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), exhibit relative standard deviations among laboratories (RSDR) that are less than 2 times the values predicted from the Horwitz equation: RSDR, % = 2(1-0.5log10C) where C is the concentration expressed as a decimal fraction. The precision of TLC and LC methods is about the same, but that of ELISA is somewhat poorer. For those commodities for which sufficient data exist to provide a meaningful comparison, the methods applied to cottonseed products have the best precision and corn the worst, with peanuts intermediate. Overall, however, the primary factor affecting RSDR is concentration, more or less independent of analyte, method, matrix, and age of the study. If it is assumed that the test results are normally distributed and that an RSDR of 50% is the point where effective control of the results begins to be lost (a value equivalent to the production of 2% false-negative values), then relying on the Horwitz curve, the limit of quantitative measurement is the single digit, i.e., 5, micrograms/kg (10(-9); ppb) concentration for solid food commodities. Such a value must be considered as a limit applicable to a single analyte, aflatoxin B1, and not as a mean, and not applicable to the sum of the individual components, each of whose associated standard deviation would lie in the unacceptable region. Enforcement of a 5 micrograms aflatoxin B1/kg limit, under the assumptions made, requires that a responsible manufacturer and a prudent regulator operate at opposite extremes of tolerance limits: e.g., the producer at 2 micrograms/kg and the consumer at 10. A proposed Codex ""maximum level"" of 0.05 micrograms aflatoxin M1/kg milk cannot be supported by the available data applied in an interlaboratory enforcement environment.

In feedmills, 4% of samples contained AFB1; 17% among sunflower meal samples (20-80 ppb) and 4% among corn (110 ppb) and mixed feed samples (20-110 ppb). On poultry farms, 17% of samples were found contaminated with AFB1; 20% were positive among pellets and 16% among crumbles and 15% mash feeds. The level of contamination ranged from 20 ppb to 200 ppb, except for 4 samples that contained high levels of AFB1 (2000-5625 ppb). These highly-contaminated samples were associated with clinical aflatoxicosis in broiler chickens. The most frequent incidence of AFB1 contamination and the highest AFB1 contamination occurred in feeding troughs (23%).

8448356,"Strains of Fusarium moniliforme produce a variety of toxins, including several uncharacterized mutagens that act directly in the Ames assay using Salmonella typhimurium, strain TA 100. The Ames assay was used to monitor isolation of the direct-acting mutagens from the F. moniliforme culture extracts. Seven strains were tested, of which strains F07 and F84 contained the highest levels of direct-acting mutagens. Extracts of strain F84 were fractionated on a silica gel column, eluted with methanol-chloroform (1:9). This fraction was then separated on a reverse-phase, C-18 column with 50% methanol in water as eluant and further purified by TLC. One compound was isolated and given the trivial name fusarin X (FX). Its structure was determined from its UV (lambda max 357 nm), 500-MHz NMR, and mass spectra, and those of its diacetate, to be the 1-hydroxy analog of the previously characterized fusarin C. FX was present in culture extracts of strains F07 and F84 at 83 and 8 micrograms/g, respectively, which was proportional to their relative mutagenicities. It was not detected in the other strains tested. Since exposure of FX most likely occurs in cooked corn, its thermal stability was measured; it, like FC, decomposes at 100 degrees C, especially at high pH. Again, in common with FC, it was decomposed by GSH.

Ground barley, ground corn and dried sugar beet pulp were used as concentrate sources. Chopped winter wheat straw was fed as roughage source. All rations were supplemented with a protein-mineral-vitamin-premix. In sacco dry matter degradability of artificially dried ryegrass, untreated and ammonia treated wheat straw was measured within three rumen fistulated sheep. Nylon bags were incubated for 48 h in the rumen of sheep. Volatile fatty acids of rumen fluid were determined by gas chromatography. Samples were taken via rumen fistula 3 h after morning feeding. Apparent digestibility of organic matter and fibre fractions of total rations were determined within five sheep. Increased concentrate portion decreased in sacco dry matter degradability of incubated roughages. Decrease of dry matter degradability was much higher for ammonia treated (from 55.0 to 22.5%) and untreated straw (from 50.9 to 22.7%) than for ryegrass (from 75.6 to 69.2%), when concentrate increased from 0 to 100% of ration. The highest concentrate portions did not show any increase of degradability of ammonia treated straw. Specific concentrate effects were observed when 75 and 100% concentrate were fed (unphysiological level). Ground barley as concentrate source decreased rumen pH to a larger extent (down to 5.18) than corn and sugar beet pulp (down to 5.60 and 5.57). Sheep suffered from rumen acidosis in some cases.

R., and Ravel, J. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11228-11232). One form, designated eIF-4F, is a complex containing two subunits, p220 and p26. The other form, designated eIF-(iso)4F, is a complex containing two subunits, p82 and p28, which are antigenically distinct from the subunits of eIF-4F. Both the p26 subunit of eIF-4F and the p28 subunit of eIF-(iso)4F are m7G cap-binding proteins. In this investigation, affinity-purified antibodies to the p220 and p26 subunits of wheat germ eIF-4F and to the p82 and p28 subunits of wheat germ eIF-(iso)4F were used to determine if isozyme forms of eIF-4F are present in maize and cauliflower. Extracts from wheat germ, maize root tips, and cauliflower inflorescences were partially purified by adsorption on m7GTP-Sepharose and elution with m7GTP (MGS eluate). Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies to the subunits of the wheat germ factors showed that the MGS eluate from maize contains polypeptides that react with antibodies to the p82 and p28 subunits of wheat eIF-(iso)4F, as well as polypeptides that react with antibodies to the p220 and p26 subunits of wheat eIF-4F. The MGS eluate from cauliflower also contains polypeptides that reacted with antibodies to the subunits of wheat eIF-(iso)4F. These results indicate that both maize and cauliflower contain the isozyme form of eIF-4F. In addition, it was found that the factors in the MGS eluate from maize support polypeptide synthesis in a system from wheat deficient in eIF-4F and eIF-(iso)4F, whereas the factors in the MGS eluate from cauliflower support polypeptide synthesis only to a small extent.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D001937', 'D002848', 'D004591', 'D039562', 'D014644', 'D046911', 'D008970', 'D010448', 'D010944', 'D014176', 'D014908', 'D003313']","['Brassica', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F', 'Genetic Variation', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Initiation Factors', 'Plants', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays']",Identification of an isozyme form of protein synthesis initiation factor 4F in plants.,"['Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","['metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1577779,1992

1727385,"Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the five leading human cancers causing at least 250,000 deaths each year. One of the major risk factors for this disease is exposure to dietary aflatoxins, and the development of appropriate molecular dosimetry biomarkers would facilitate the identification of individuals at risk. This study was undertaken to explore the relationship between dietary intake of aflatoxins and the excretion of the major aflatoxin-DNA adduct and other metabolites into the urine of chronically exposed people. The following protocol was developed for this investigation in Guangxi Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China, where the diets of 30 males and 12 females (ages, 25-64 years) were monitored for 1 week and aflatoxin intake levels determined each day. Starting on the fourth day, total urine volumes were obtained in consecutive 12-h fractions for 3 or 4 days. High performance liquid chromatography and competitive radioimmunoassay analyses were done on each of the urine samples, and the relationships between excretion of total aflatoxin metabolites, aflatoxin-N7-guanine, aflatoxin M1, aflatoxin P1, and aflatoxin B1, and aflatoxin B1 intake values were determined. The average intake of aflatoxin B1 by men was 48.4 micrograms/day, giving a total mean exposure during the study period of 276.8 micrograms. The average daily intake by women was 77.4 micrograms/day, resulting in a total average exposure during the 7-day period of 542.6 micrograms aflatoxin B1. Initial efforts to characterize aflatoxin metabolites in urine samples were with an analysis by competitive radioimmunoassay. The analysis by linear regression of the association between aflatoxin B1 intake/day and total aflatoxin metabolite excretion/day showed a correlation coefficient of only 0.26. These findings stimulated the immunoaffinity/analytical high performance liquid chromatography analysis for individual metabolites. When the data were analyzed by linear regression analysis, the aflatoxin N7-guanine excretion and aflatoxin B1 intake from the previous day showed a correlation coefficient of 0.65 and P less than 0.000001. Similar analysis for aflatoxin M1 resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.55 and P less than 0.00001, whereas there was no positive statistical association between exposure in the diet and aflatoxin P1 excretion, despite aflatoxin P1 being quantitatively a major metabolite. Analysis of the total aflatoxin-N7-guanine excretion in the urine during the complete collection period plotted against the total aflatoxin B1 exposure in the diet for each of the individuals, smoothing the day to day variations, revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.80 and P less than 0.0000001.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Cancer research,"['D000328', 'D016604', 'D016607', 'D000348', 'D002681', 'D002851', 'D004247', 'D004781', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D008875', 'D011863', 'D003313']","['Adult', 'Aflatoxin B1', 'Aflatoxin M1', 'Aflatoxins', 'China', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Zea mays']","Molecular dosimetry of urinary aflatoxin-DNA adducts in people living in Guangxi Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China.","[None, 'Q000008', 'Q000652', 'Q000652', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'administration & dosage', 'urine', 'urine', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1727385,1992

Individual fractions eluted from TLC or LC were acetylated, then analyzed by ELISA. Determinations of TDP toxins at levels as low as 0.1 and 0.5 ng were achieved by ELISA in combination with LC and TLC, respectively.

The assay for BaP-globin adducts was based on the release of tetrahydroxy-BaP (BaP-tetrols) from globin by mild acid hydrolysis. After extensive isolation, BaP-tetrols were quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography using fluorescence detection. BaP-tetrol levels were measured in rats dosed intraperitoneally with 242, 71 and 24 mumol BaP kg-1 body weight in corn oil. The formation of BaP-tetrols was not linear with dose. The lowest dose yielded adduct levels that represented the limits of sensitivity for the method, as performed in this laboratory. Once this limit of sensitivity was established, the potential use of the assay was assessed by measuring the radiochemical binding of inhaled [14C]BaP or its metabolites to the globin of F344/N rats. Rats were exposed for 4 h per day, 1 day per week, for 12 weeks to pure aerosols of [14C]BaP at a level of 2 mg m-3. At the conclusion of exposure, rats were sacrificed and globin was isolated.

Therefore, metal concentrations were determined in different rat tissues at the end of a toxicity study with TCDD in which a pair-fed control group was introduced. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a single i.p. injection of corn oil/acetone with or without TCDD at 125 micrograms/kg.

After acid digestion of the tissues metals were determined by atomic emission spectrometry (AES). The most outstanding effect of TCDD treatment was an increase of the copper levels in the kidney (4-fold, versus pair-fed controls) and in the liver (greater than 2-fold, versus pair-fed controls). Other metals were mainly affected by the reduced food intake only.

1910520,"Mass spectrometric analysis of the stable carbon isotope composition (13C/12C or delta 13C) of bone collagen from human remains recovered at archaeological sites provides a direct chemical method for investigating dietary patterns of prehistoric human populations. This methodology is based on the facts that (1) different food items within the human diet have distinct delta 13C values, and (2) the delta 13C value of human bone collagen is determined by the delta 13C value of the diet. Studies of the development of subsistence patterns based on corn agriculture, one of the most significant developments in North American prehistory, can benefit from the use of stable carbon isotope techniques because corn has a high delta 13C value relative to other components of the human diet. Measurements of delta 13C of bone collagen from prehistoric human skeletal remains from southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas indicate that intensive corn agriculture began in this region around A.D. 1000, that the incorporation of corn into the human diet was a rapid phenomenon, and that 35 to 77% of the human diet from A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1600 consisted of corn. Results from an isochronous population in southeastern South Dakota (A.D. 1400) suggest that 78 to 90% of the diet of this group consisted of corn, with no difference between males and females.

Current methods of analysis for DON and related trichothecene mycotoxins involve gas chromatography with electron capture detection, thin-layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Improved sensitivity and selectivity for DON, as well as for the related compounds nivalenol and fusarenon-X, are made possible by the use of high-performance liquid chromatography with online, postcolumn photolysis and oxidative amperometric detection (HPLC-hv-EC). Conditions are optimized with respect to residence time in the photolytic reactor, applied potentials, mobile phase pH, and chromatographic parameters for the separation of DON, nivalenol, and fusarenon-X, and the technique is found to be linear over a range of 10 ppb-2 ppm with minimum detection limits on the order of 1-2 ng on-column (10-20 ppb).

2403859,"We report the effects of several inducers of P450 metabolizing enzymes on DNA adduct formation by 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) in C57BL/6 mice. We also examined the role of N:O-acetylation and the nitrenium ion in the genotoxicity of MeIQx, since these have been implicated in the activation of other aminoimidazoazaarenes (AIA) to DNA reactive species. Mice were given phenobarbital (PB), Aroclor 1254, beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) or corn oil, i.p., followed 3-5 days later with oral administration of MeIQx. Induction of Aroclor and BNF produced DNA with 8-fold more adducts than either the corn oil-alone or PB-treated animals. Both corn oil-alone and PB-treated animals were similar. Four major adducts were found in all cases with no differences among inducers as judged by co-chromatography. Azido-MeIQx induced calf-thymus-DNA adducts produced identical adduct profiles to those seen for the mouse DNA. Similar adduct profiles were obtained from Salmonella TA98, and the nitroreductase deficient strains (TA98NR and TA98/1,8-DNP6) exposed to MeIQx in the presence of Aroclor-induced-mouse-liver S9. Adduct frequencies in TA98/1,8-DNP6 were significantly lower than in TA98 and TA98NR. The data described in this report demonstrate that induction quantitatively increases adduct numbers but does not affect the types of DNA damage. These data also suggest that the same DNA reactive intermediates are formed in vivo as in vitro and support the hypothesis that the metabolism of MeIQx involves the P450I family of isozymes, N:O-acetyltransferases and possibly a nitrenium ion.

The comminuted food sample as an aqueous sodium sulfate slurry is equilibrated with stirring for 1 h at room temperature before a 1 mL headspace aliquot is removed and injected using a modified on-column syringe needle. Methyl bromide is cryogenically focussed at -60 degrees C and then eluted by temperature programming. The procedure requires blending of soft samples, e.g. raisins, prunes, or oranges, and ultrasonic homogenization of hard samples, e.g. wheat, cocoa beans, corn, or nuts, with portions of water and ice so the final temperature of the food-water slurry is less than 1 degree C. A 20 g aliquot (4 g food) is then added to a cold headspace vial containing 4 g sodium sulfate. Losses of MB during a 3.5 min ultrasonic homogenization of wheat were 11% at 0.95 ppb and 4.4% at 4.8 ppb. For flour, cocoa, and finely divided spices, which do not require blending, 4 g is added to the cold headspace vial containing 16 mL cold water and 4 g sodium sulfate. Studies show that comminution of wheat or peanuts must be carried out to release MB trapped within the food so the headspace equilibrium can be attained in 1 h as well as to obtain homogeneous samples and representative sampling.

Twelve raw and roasted peanut and corn portions containing various concentrations of natural aflatoxins and supplemented when appropriate with aflatoxin B1 were distributed to participating laboratories for testing. The assay is based on competition between an enzyme-conjugated aflatoxin B1 and (free) aflatoxins in the test sample for aflatoxin-specific antibodies coated onto interior surfaces of microtiter wells. After a wash step to remove all unbound aflatoxins, a substrate added to each well is catalyzed from a colorless to a blue solution by any bound enzyme-conjugated aflatoxin B1 present.

The hexane and acetonitrile are decanted, filtered, and separated; the hexane and rehydrated food are reextracted with 2 additional portions of acetonitrile, and the combined acetonitrile extracts are concentrated and diluted to 10 mL. An aliquot is analyzed as described in the official method, using a 150 x 4.6 mm 5 microns C-18 column. The need for rehydration to maximize the recovery of BHA and other antioxidants from marketplace dry food samples such as potato flakes, dry coffee whiteners, and dessert topping mixes was demonstrated. Rehydration was not required for cheese snacks, breakfast cereals, cake mixes, and some other foods. The need for rehydration should be determined by analyzing other foods with and without the addition of water. Potato and corn chips, popcorn and cheese snacks, breakfast cereals, dry beverage mixes, rice, potato flakes, french fried potatoes, and cake mixes were spiked with the above antioxidants at 10-50 ppm. Overall recoveries ranged from 64.3 to 105.6% and repeatabilities ranged from 0.7 to 10.8%.

3401476,"Mice of the GR/A strain were fed four different isocaloric semipurified diets, enriched in either (1) saturated fatty acids (palm oil), or (2) polyunsaturated fatty acids (corn oil), or (3) palm oil plus cholesterol, or (4) a fat-poor diet containing only a minimal amount of essential fatty acids. We have studied the effects of these dietary lipids on the density profile and composition of the plasma lipoproteins and on the lipid composition and fluidity of (purified) lymphoid cell membranes in healthy mice and in mice bearing a transplanted lymphoid leukemia (GRSL). Tumor development in these mice occurred in the spleen and in ascites. While the fatty acid composition of the VLDL-triacylglycerols still strongly resembled the dietary lipids, the effects of the diets decreased in the order VLDL-triacylglycerols greater than HDL-phospholipids greater than plasma membrane phospholipids. Diet-induced differences in the latter fraction were virtually confined to the content of oleic acid and linoleic acid, and they were too small to affect the membrane fluidity, as measured by fluorescence polarization using the probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Healthy mice were almost irresponsive to dietary cholesterol, but in the tumor bearers, where lipoprotein metabolism has been shown to be disturbed, the cholesterol diet caused a substantial increase in the low- and very-low density regions of both blood and ascites plasma lipoproteins. The cholesterol-rich diet also increased the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio and lipid structural order (decreased fluidity) in GRSL ascites cell membranes, but not in the splenic GRSL cell membranes. We conclude that the composition of plasma lipoproteins and cell membrane lipids in GR/A mice is subject to exquisite homeostatic control. However, in these low-responders to dietary lipids the development of an ascites tumor may lead to increased responsiveness to dietary cholesterol. The elevated level of membrane cholesterol thus obtained in GRSL ascites cells did not affect the expression of various cell surface antigens or tumor cell growth.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,"['D000818', 'D001202', 'D002462', 'D002784', 'D004041', 'D004161', 'D005227', 'D007942', 'D008074', 'D008075', 'D008079', 'D008297', 'D008560', 'D008563', 'D051379', 'D009368', 'D013050', 'D013154']","['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cholesterol', 'Dietary Fats', 'Diphenylhexatriene', 'Fatty Acids', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lipoproteins', 'Lipoproteins, HDL', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL', 'Male', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spleen']",Effect of dietary lipids on plasma lipoproteins and fluidity of lymphoid cell membranes in normal and leukemic mice.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000097', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'blood', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3401476,1988

A reliable analytical method for the quantitative determination of citreoviridin in corn and rice is described. Corn or rice is extracted with dichloromethane, and the extract is partially purified on silica and amino solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns. The extract is analyzed for citreoviridin by normal-phase liquid chromatography, using a mobile phase of ethyl acetate-hexane (75 + 25) at 1.5 mL/min and a fluorescence detector to measure the yellow fluorescence (388 nm excitation, 480 nm emission). With a 100 microL injection loop, the relationship between concentration and injection volume is linear for 20-60 microL injections. Recoveries of citreoviridin added to yellow corn at 10-50 ng/g were 91.0-96.9%; recoveries from white corn (10-50 ng/g added) were 96.8-102.8%. Recoveries of 5000 ng/g added to white corn were 89.0%, indicating that heavily contaminated samples can be assayed by the method. Minimum detection limits were 10 ng for citreoviridin standard and 2 ng/g for citreoviridin added to corn.

This effect was utilized in developing a unique reverse-phase liquid chromatographic (LC) method for determination of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 (B1 detection limit 1 ppb), without preparing derivatives of B1 and G1. The aflatoxins are dissolved in methanol or the mobile phase for injection onto the LC system. Using a mobile phase of methanol-beta-cyclodextrin (1 + 1), the aflatoxins are resolved on a C18 column. Fluorescence of the aflatoxins is enhanced by post-column introduction of an aqueous concentrated beta-cyclodextrin solution. All 4 aflatoxins elute within 10 min in the order G2, G1, B2, B1. Fluorescence responses for B1 and G1 standards were linear over the concentration range 0.5-10 ng, yielding correlation coefficients (r) of 0.9989 and 1.000, respectively. The average peak response ratio for G1:B1 for the mobile phase-enhancement solution described was 0.765 with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.98%.

In addition, carbofuran was applied to previously untreated plots in 1984 and all 7 materials were applied to previously untreated plots in 1985. Sampling and analysis were carried out as in 1983. Persistence was assessed on the basis of the disappearance rates measured for the 1st 8 wk and of a calculated Effectiveness Potential (the ratio of the average residue in the upper 5 cm of the band at 8, 10 and 12 wk and the published LC95 for western corn rootworm in clay loam soil). Soils treated with carbofuran and isofenphos in 1984 and all soils treated in 1985 were tested for anti-insecticide activity. Soil cores from some carbofuran, chlorpyrifos and terbufos treated plots were sectioned vertically to establish the distribution of the insecticides during 1985. In addition, granular and pure chemical forms of isofenphos and carbofuran were applied at 10 ppm to anti-isofenphos and anti-carbofuran active and control soils (from field plots) maintained at 10 and 20% moisture in the laboratory to assess the effect of formulation and moisture on persistence in active soils. Insecticide concentrations were determined at 0,1,3,7, 10,14,21,28, and 35 days.

The results meet acceptable limits, since each sample's t-test result is less than the published value of the /t/, which is 1.6909 for the test conditions. The null hypothesis is retained since the sample sizes do not give significantly different values for the mean analyte concentration. The percent coefficients of variation (CVs) for all samples tested were within the expected range. In addition, the variance due to sample mixing was evaluated using radioisotope-labeled materials, yielding an acceptable CV of 22.2%.

Whereas the 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) for murine erythroleukemia cells was about 1 microgram/ml for 4-deoxynivalenol and 3,7-dideoxynivalenol, all of the other analogs were at least 10-fold less potent. When tested at their ID50 dose, all of the 8-oxotrichothecenes, except 4-deoxynivalenol and 3,7-dideoxynivalenol, caused polysome 'run-off', indicating that, at this dose, they are inhibitors of polypeptide chain initiation. With 4-deoxynivalenol and 3,7-dideoxynivalenol, polysomes remained at control levels indicating that these toxins prevent polypeptide chain elongation. From these results and comparisons to previous studies of 8-oxo-12,13-epoxytrichothecenes (trichothecolone, trichothecin, nivalenol and fusarenone X), trichothecenes with substituents at both C-3 and C-4 predominantly inhibit polypeptide chain initiation, whereas those lacking one substituent at either site are inhibitors of chain elongation.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,"['D002478', 'D010452', 'D010441', 'D010442', 'D011132', 'D014176', 'D012717', 'D013055', 'D013329', 'D014255']","['Cells, Cultured', 'Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Peptide Chain Elongation, Translational', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'Polyribosomes', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trichothecenes']","Protein synthesis inhibition by 8-oxo-12,13-epoxytrichothecenes.","[None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000138']","[None, None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, 'pharmacology', None, None, 'chemical synthesis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3814614,1987

Definite distinction was achieved by immunoprecipitation of the two isoenzymes with antisera raised against the respective isoenzymes from spinach leaves. The proportion of cytosol aldolase as part of total aldolase activity was 8, 9, 14, and 4.5% in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), pea, wheat, and corn leaves, respectively. For corn leaves we also obtained values of up to 15%. The K(m) (FBP) values were about 5-fold lower for the cytosol (1.1-2.3 micromolar concentration) than for the chloroplast enzymes (8.0-10.5 micromolar concentration).

The carcinogenicity of NMAMBA was shown by the induction of forestomach carcinomas and liver tumors in mice and rats. Another new nitrosamine, N-2-methylpropyl-N-methylacetonyl nitrosamine, was isolated in millet and wheat flour after similar treatment. Some species of fungi not only can reduce nitrates to nitrites but also can increase the amount of secondary amines in the moldy foods and provide favorable conditions for the synthesis of nitrosamines. Some fungi may utilize primary amines to synthesize nitrosamines in appropriate culture mediums. Furthermore, the cornmeal may naturally contain trace amounts of nitrosamines, as detected by a gas chromatography/thermoenergy analyzer. Prolonged feeding of F. moniliforme-inoculated cornbread alone also induced the development of forestomach carcinoma in rats. This indicates the occurrence of potential carcinogens, perhaps certain Fusarium mycotoxins, in the moldy cornbread in addition to the carcinogenic nitrosamines. Another nitroso compound, Roussin red methylester (di-mu-methanethiolatotetranitrosodiiron) was found in pickled vegetables that are eaten daily in the Linxian (China) area. Roussin Red may provide NO-2 ions, which would react readily with secondary amines to form nitrosamines.

EDB residues were extracted by soaking in hexane, triple co-distillation with hexane from an aqueous sample solution, and soaking in acetone-water (5 + 1). Each method was used for triplicate analyses of 12 samples containing incurred residues of EDB ranging from about 10 to 1000 ppb and representing whole grains (wheat and oats) and intermediate grain-based products such as corn meal and flour. The 4-day hexane soaking method extracted the least EDB. In some cases, this was half of the amount determined by the other methods. Levels from soaking in acetone-water were equal to, or up to 25% greater than, those from distillation. Although soaking for 2 days is required for whole grains in the method, a period of only 16 h was found acceptable for ground products. Results were obtained faster with the distillation method, but more analyst time per sample was required. A single distillation recovered about 80% (40-60% from wheat) of total EDB extracted by triple distillation.

A portion of the extract was diluted with 10% NaCl solution to a final concentration of 50% methanol, and then defatted with hexane. The aflatoxins were partitioned into chloroform. The chloroform solution was evaporated, and the residue was placed on a 0.5 g disposable silica gel column. The column was washed with 3 mL each of hexane, ethyl ether, and methylene chloride. Aflatoxins were eluted with 6 mL chloroform-acetone (9 + 1).

6719463,"Rats were treated with [14C]chloroform (14CHCl3) in corn oil (CO) or corn oil alone 18 hr following pretreatment with 2-hexanone (2-HX) in corn oil or corn oil alone. Livers were removed, homogenized 1,2, and 6 hr post-14CHCl3 administration, and glutathione (GSH) content, irreversible binding of 14CHCl3-derived radiolabel, and phospholipid composition were determined. The combination of 2-HX + CHCl3 reduced GSH content to 21% of control (CO + CO) 1 hr after CHCl3 administration. No significant rebound of GSH was observed 24 hr post-CHCl3 administration. In contrast, GSH was not altered by administration of CHCl3 to CO-pretreated rats. Although 14CHCl3-derived radiolabel was irreversibly bound to hepatic macromolecules of both CO- and 2-HX-pretreated rats, total irreversibly bound 14C was significantly enhanced in 2-HX-pretreated rats at all time points. The latter observation was consistent with the decrease in GSH of 2-HX-pretreated rats. Total 14C binding in 2-HX-pretreated rats reached a plateau 2 hr post-14CHCl3 administration and was distributed 52% in protein, 41% in lipid, and 7% in acid soluble fractions 6 hr post-14CHCl3 administration. 2-HX enhanced 14C binding to protein and lipid at each time point. Radiolabel was not detected in neutral lipids of control or 2-hexanone-treated animals, but was enhanced 33-fold in phospholipids of 2-hexanone-treated animals. Phospholipid fatty acid methyl ester derivatives did not contain 14C indicating the radiolabel was most likely associated with phospholipid polar head groups. Two dimensional thin layer chromatographic analysis of phospholipid from treated animals demonstrated that 87% of the total radiolabel was associated with a specific phospholipid (14C-PL) which had a 1:1 molar ratio of phosphate to 14C. The latter indicates that the 14C-PL was a monophospholipid derivative of 14CHCl3 reactive intermediate, generally thought to be phosgene. Concurrent decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine content from 23% of total phospholipid to 7%, accumulation of 14C-PL to 2.6% of total phospholipid, and increase in lysophosphatidylethanolamine from 1 to 7% of total phospholipid during 2-hexanone + 14CHCl3 treatment indicated that the amine moiety of phosphatidylethanolamine polar head groups was the probable target of phosgene-lipid interaction, and that a degradative pathway existed which removed the abnormal phospholipid from hepatic membranes. No phospholipid other than phosphatidylethanolamine was depleted.

6688080,"Cereal proteins have been extremely difficult to purify and characterize owing to their heterogeneity, poor solubility and tendency to polymerize. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a 300 A reversed-phase (RP)(C18) support (Syn Chropak RP-P), using acetonitrile as organic modifier in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, has been found to be capable of high-resolution separations of these proteins; the resolution is often better than that obtained by any other chromatographic or electrophoretic method. Examples are presented showing separations of low-molecular-weight gliadins, omega-gliadins and ethanol-soluble reduced glutenin subunits from wheat and of zein from corn. In addition, proteins may be directly extracted from ground single kernels and subsequently analyzed by RP-HPLC; applications in genetic studies, in breeding programs and in varietal identification are proposed. In addition to its high resolution, RP-HPLC is superior to most other methods in speed, sensitivity, reproducibility and suitability for quantitation. Polypeptide chains of molecular weight up to 133,000 are recovered in high yields and the column capacity is high, demonstrating that RP-HPLC is suitable for both preparative and analytical separations of proteins. RP-HPLC resolves proteins primarily on the basis of differences in surface hydrophobicity, so it therefore complements, rather than duplicates, other techniques that separate proteins on the basis of size or charge. RP-HPLC promises to become an invaluable technique for the fractionation and characterization of proteins from cereals and other sources.",Journal of chromatography,"['D002851', 'D004044', 'D002523', 'D004591', 'D005903', 'D005983', 'D010940', 'D014908', 'D003313', 'D015028']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Edible Grain', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gliadin', 'Glutens', 'Plant Proteins', 'Triticum', 'Zea mays', 'Zein']",Separation of cereal proteins by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.,"['Q000379', 'Q000302', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000031', 'Q000302', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000302']","['methods', 'isolation & purification', 'analysis', None, 'isolation & purification', 'analogs & derivatives', 'isolation & purification', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6688080,1983

Fecal BP excretion was increased 13 times (to 6% of the dose) when 5% wheat brain was used in place of Alphacel and 4.5 times when a commercial diet was used. This suggests that bran adsorbed or sequestered the BP. Water content of the large-intestine contents was increased when the brain diet was fed.

The entire content of a canned food product is blended with 2N HNO3 and allowed to stand 16 h; then the sample is again blended and a subsample is taken. The subsample is digested by wet ashing using nitric acid-perchloric acid or nitric acid-sulfuric acid-hydrogen peroxide. The pH of the sample is adjusted with ammonium hydroxide, and the lead is extracted into butyl acetate as the pyrrolidinecarbodithioate complex. Lead concentration is determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Recoveries of lead ranged from 92 to 104% for added 100-mesh lead particulate. Within-sample variability for green beans was reduced from 37% obtained with blending alone to 3.7% using the proposed procedure at the 3.1 micrograms/g added lead level. Variability was 7.6% at the 0.68 microgram/g level and 16.4% at the 0.20 microgram/g level of added lead.

856576,"Inhibition by CO of benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation was studied in hepatic microsomes from rats pretreated with phenobarbital, 3-methylcholanthrene or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, from animals treated with vehicle (saline or corn oil, respectively), and in a reconstituted microsomal cytochrome P-448 system prepared from rats treated with 3-methylcholanthrene. In all preparations the hydroxylation was inhibited by CO, and this inhibition was most effectively reversed by irradiation with monochromatic light of 450 nm wavelength. These observations provide direct evidence that the oxygen-activating component of all the examined benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase systems is a P-450-type heme protein. The only striking difference observed in these systems was the low CO sensitivity of the benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase reaction in microsomes from animals treated with 3-methylcholanthrene or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Half-maximal inhibition occurred at CO/O2 ratios of 9--12, rather than at 1--2, which is the usual range for P-450-linked mixed-function oxidase reactions. In contrast, the reconstituted benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase system, with purified cytochrome P-448 from 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rats, exhibited a considerably higher sensitivity towards CO (CO/O2 ratio approximately 1), well within the range for mixed-function oxidase reactions. It is concluded that the observed diminished CO sensitivity of microsomal benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase in 3-methylcholanthrene- or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-treated rats results from alterations in the composition and/or structural organization of the microenvironment of cytochrome P-448 in the endoplasmic reticulum in response to the inducing action of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and related agents, and is not related to changes in the heme protein P-448 per se.

Anthranilic acid was present and the beta-glucoside was also identified by paper chromatography and beta-glucosdase and acid treatment. A third major fluorescent compound was not identified, but it was convertible to anthranilic acid by acid treatment. Anthranilate synthetase from mutant plants was 3-40 times more active and was also more resistant to feedback inhibition by tryptophan than was the enzyme from normal plants. The high activity and feedback resistance would both lead to anthranilate accumulation. Anthranilate-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (PR transferase), the enzyme which usually utilizes anthranilate in the tryptophan pathway, was inhibited by the beta-glucoside of anthranilic acid in a noncompetitive manner and showed very little activity in the mutant plant extract. This inhibition of the enzyme which utilizes anthranilate would also lead to accumulation. Apparently the oversynthesis of anthranilate leads to the formation of the beta-glucoside, which inhibits anthranilate utilization.

The enzyme, termed hydroperoxide isomerase, converts the conjugated diene hydroperoxide of linoleic acid to the corresponding monoenoic ketohydroxy fatty acid. The structure of the latter has been determined by ultraviolet, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; periodate and permangate oxidation; gas chromatography; and thin layer chromatography. Hydroperoxide isomerase activity has also been demonstrated in crude extracts from barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat germ (Triticum aestivum), mung beans (Phaseolus aureus), and corn (Zea mays) and from partially purified extracts of soybean (Glycine max).The hydroperoxide isomerase enzyme from flaxseed has a pH optimum of 7.0. The enzyme was not inhibited by nordihydroguairetic acid, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, or cyanide, but it was inhibited by cupric ion. One hundred per cent of the activity was lost by heating the enzyme for 1 minute at 68 C. Both linoleic and linolenic acid hydroperoxides can serve as substrates for the enzyme. The pH optimum for the hydroperoxide isomerase enzyme from barley is 6.2; from wheat germ, 6.1; and from soybean, 6.1.The identification of the hydroperoxide isomerase enzyme clarifies the role of lipoxidase in plant tissue and suggests a participation of lipid in the electron transport system.",Plant physiology,[],[],Hydroperoxide isomerase: a new enzyme of lipid metabolism.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16657484,2010

5970465,"Of 53 isolates of Chaetomium globosum Kunze isolated from corn, manufactured feed, and fiberboard, grown on autoclaved corn, and fed to rats, 25 were lethal within 4 to 6 days. Thirty-six single ascospore cultures of one isolate were uniformly lethal when similarly grown and fed to rats. Incubation of the fungus on corn for 6 to 8 weeks resulted in greater toxicity than shorter incubation times. Premortem symptoms indicated damage to the central nervous system of the affected animals, and postmortem lesions included hemoglobinuria, hemorrhagic enteritis, and subdural hemorrhaging. Corn invaded by C. globosum and toxic to rats had no detectable effects on swine when fed as their sole ration for 6 weeks, and appeared to be consumed with relish. The toxic substance was best obtained by defatting the fungus-invaded corn with petroleum ether (bp, 60 to 70 C), extraction with acetone, and further purification by elution from a silica gel column with acetone and 5% acetone in chloroform.",Applied microbiology,"['D000818', 'D001203', 'D002845', 'D004751', 'D006456', 'D009183', 'D051381', 'D013552', 'D003313']","['Animals', 'Ascomycota', 'Chromatography', 'Enteritis', 'Hemoglobinuria', 'Mycotoxins', 'Rats', 'Swine', 'Zea mays']",Toxicity to rats of corn invaded by Chaetomium globosum.,"[None, 'Q000472', None, 'Q000209', 'Q000209', 'Q000633', None, None, None]","[None, 'pathogenicity', None, 'etiology', 'etiology', 'toxicity', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5970465,1967

5893805,"Eighty-five fungi isolated from prepared feed and from corn collected on farms were grown separately in moist autoclaved corn. The corn was fed to virgin weanling rats for 5 to 12 days; the rats were then killed, and their uteri were removed and weighed. Twelve isolates of Fusarium from corn and one from poinsettias caused increases of five to eight times in weight of the uterus as compared with controls that were fed sound corn. The greatest increase in weight of the uterus was caused by corn inoculated with Fusarium No. 5 incubated for 21 days at 20 to 25 C followed by 14 days at 12 C. Extraction of this corn with methylene chloride, separation into fractions by means of a silicic acid column, and further purification by thin-layer chromatography yielded a compound with ultraviolet-absorption maxima at 314, 274, and 236 mmu.",Applied microbiology,"['D000818', 'D002855', 'D005260', 'D005516', 'D005670', 'D009929', 'D051381', 'D013053', 'D013552', 'D013553', 'D014118', 'D014599', 'D003313']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Female', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fusarium', 'Organ Size', 'Rats', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Swine', 'Swine Diseases', 'Toxins, Biological', 'Uterus', 'Zea mays']",Effect on the white rat uterus of a toxic substance isolated from Fusarium.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000187', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'drug effects', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5893805,1966
