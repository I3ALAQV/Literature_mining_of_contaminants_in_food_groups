35201367,"The design and production of incurred test materials are critical for the development and validation of methods for food allergen analysis. This is because production and processing conditions, together with the food matrix, can modify allergens affecting their structure, extractability and detectability. For the ThRAll project, which aims to develop a mass spectrometry-based reference method for the simultaneous accurate quantification of six allergenic ingredients in two hard to analyse matrices. Two highly processed matrices, chocolate bars and broth powder, were selected to incur with six allergenic ingredients (egg, milk, peanut, soy, hazelnut and almond) at 2, 4, 10 and 40 mg total allergenic protein/kg food matrix using a pilot-scale food manufacturing plant. The allergenic activity of the ingredients incurred was verified using food-allergic patient serum/plasma IgE, the homogeneity of the incurred matrices verified and their stability at 4 °C assessed over at least 30-month storage using appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Allergens were found at all levels from the chocolate bar and were homogenously distributed, apart from peanut and soy which could only be determined above 4 mg total allergenic ingredient protein/kg. The homogeneity assessment was restricted to analysis of soy, milk and peanut for the broth powder but nevertheless demonstrated that the allergens were homogeneously distributed. All the allergens tested were found to be stable in the incurred matrices for at least 30 months demonstrating they are suitable for method development.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000485', 'D010367', 'D000069956', 'D004797', 'D005504', 'D005512', 'D006801', 'D011208']","['Allergens', 'Arachis', 'Chocolate', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Humans', 'Powders']",Development of incurred chocolate bars and broth powder with six fully characterised food allergens as test materials for food allergen analysis.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', None, None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'methods', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35201367,2022
35159490,"Reverse-phase solid-phase extraction (SPE) is regularly used for separating and purifying food-derived oligosaccharides and peptides prior to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. However, the diversity in physicochemical properties of peptides may prevent the complete separation of the two types of analytes. Peptides present in the oligosaccharide fraction not only interfere with glycomics analysis but also escape peptidomics analysis. This work evaluated different SPE approaches for improving LC-MS/MS analysis of both oligosaccharides and peptides through testing on peptide standards and a food sample of commercial interest (proteolyzed almond extract). Compared with conventional reverse-phase SPE, mixed-mode SPE (reverse-phase/strong cation exchange) was more effective in retaining small/hydrophilic peptides and capturing them in the high-organic fraction and thus allowed the identification of more oligosaccharides and dipeptides in the proteolyzed almond extract, with satisfactory MS/MS confirmation. Overall, mixed-mode SPE emerged as the ideal method for simultaneously improving the identification of food-derived oligosaccharides and small peptides using LC-MS/MS analysis.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Solid-Phase Extraction Approaches for Improving Oligosaccharide and Small Peptide Identification with Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry: A Case Study on Proteolyzed Almond Extract.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35159490,2022

Fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) is a novel lipid class that was discovered as an endogenous lipid; FAHFAs have shown anti-diabetic effects in a mammalian system. We analyzed the overall FAHFA composition in nut oils and other common oils: almond (raw, roasted), walnut, peanut, olive, palm, soybean, and rapeseed oils. We developed a method of liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) for a comprehensive target analysis of FAHFAs. The analysis revealed wide variation in the FAHFA profiles (15 compounds and 62 peaks). For 7-11 compounds of FAHFA, a total level of 8-29 pmol/mg oil was detected in nuts oils; for 11 compounds, 4.9 pmol/mg oil was detected in olive oil, and for 4-9 compounds, < 2 pmol/mg oil was detected in palm, soy, and rapeseed oils. The major FAHFAs were FAHFA 36:3, FAHFA 36:2, and FAHFA 36:4 in nut oil, FAHFA 36:2, FAHFA 34:1, and FAHFA 36:1 in olive oil, and FAHFA 32:1, FAHFA 34:0, FAHFA 36:0, and FAHFA 36:1 in all of the common oils. The composition of FAHFAs in nut oils is mainly unsaturated fatty acids, whereas those in olive oil are unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids.

34287910,"To better control the quality of synthetic vanillin obtained by using the guaiacol synthesis method, the olfactory impacts of byproducts on the aroma of the synthetic vanillin samples were evaluated and their optimum concentration ranges were determined. Four byproducts (guaiacol, ortho-vanillin, 5-methyl-vanillin, and 5-formyl-vanillin) were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantified by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) in the synthetic vanillin samples with different degrees of purity. The aroma intensities (AIs) of the four byproducts obtained by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) were: guaiacol (AI: 3.5-4.0, smoke), ortho-vanillin (AI: 1.6-2.5, almond), 5-methyl-vanillin (AI: 2.5-3.3, aldehyde), and 5-formyl-vanillin (AI: 3.2-3.8, green). The aroma perceptual interactions of the four byproducts and the vanillin in the synthetic vanillin samples were determined by S-curve analysis. Guaiacol and 5-methyl-vanillin showed synergistic effects by Feller's additive model. Combined with the results of an addition experiment, when the contents of guaiacol, ortho-vanillin, 5-methyl-vanillin, and 5-formyl-vanillin were within 50, 10, 400, and 1,000 mg/kg respectively, the byproducts had no effects on the aroma quality of the synthetic vanillin samples. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Synthetic vanillin is one of the most commonly used food additives. Currently, the purity of synthetic vanillin can reach 99.9%, but trace byproducts are still present. Continuing to improve the purity of synthetic vanillin will significantly increase its production costs. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether the presence of these byproducts affects the aroma quality of the synthetic vanillin samples or not. If they have a negative effect on its aroma, it will be important to reduce their content. If they have no influence or positive role, there is no need to control the content of these byproducts to very low levels. This study determined the content of the byproducts produced during the synthesis of vanillin by guaiacol glyoxylic acid method, judged the perceptual interaction between the byproducts and the vanillin in the synthetic vanillin samples, and determined the optimum range within which the byproducts had no effects on the aroma quality. This study provides a theoretical basis for improving the aroma quality of synthetic vanillin while controlling the production costs.",Journal of food science,"['D001547', 'D008401', 'D006139', 'D009812', 'D064367', 'D055549']","['Benzaldehydes', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Guaiacol', 'Odorants', 'Olfactometry', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']","Olfactory impact of guaiacol, ortho-vanillin, 5-methyl, and 5-formyl-vanillin as byproducts in synthetic vanillin.","[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287910,2021

34056853,"Almond oil, a rich source of macronutrients and micronutrients, is extracted for food flavorings and the cosmetics industry. In recent years, the need for high-quality and high-quantity production of almond oil for human consumption has been increased. The present review examines the chemical composition of almond oil, storage conditions, and clinical evidence supporting the health benefits of almond oil. From the reviewed studies, it appears that almond oil contains a significant proportion of poly and monounsaturated fatty acids, with oleic acid as the main compound, and an important amount of tocopherol and phytosterol content. Some variations in almond oil composition can be found depending on the kernel's origin and the extraction system used. Some new technologies such as ultrasonic-assisted extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, subcritical fluid extraction, and salt-assisted aqueous extraction have emerged as the most promising extraction techniques that allow eco-friendly and effective recovery of almond oil.

The objective of this study was to analyze the nutritional value of commercial products in terms of their fatty acid profile and protein digestibility from commercial PBMA. Eight commercially available PBMA were selected for fatty acid analysis, performed with gas chromatography of methylated fatty acids (GC-FAME), and, from these, four commercial products (almond drink, hemp drink, oat drink, and soy drink) were selected for a short-term in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) analysis. The fatty acid analysis results showed that most of the products predominantly contained oleic acid (C18:1 ω-9) and linoleic acid (C18:2 ω-6). Hemp drink contained the highest omega-6/omega-3 (ω6/ω3) ratio among all tested products (3.43). Oat drink and almond drink were the PBMA with the highest short-term protein digestibility, non-significantly different from cow's milk, while soy drink showed the lowest value of protein digestibility.

Although allergenic proteins in TN and PN have overall low identity, they share discrete sequences similar in physicochemical properties (PCP) to known IgE epitopes. Here, PCP-consensus peptides (cp, 13 aa and 31 aa) were identified from an alignment of epitope rich regions of walnut vicilin, Jug r 2, leader sequence (J2LS) and cross-reactive epitopes in the 2S albumins of peanut and synthesized. A peptide similarity search in the Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP) revealed a network of peptides similar (low property distance, PD) to the 13 aa cp (13cp) in many different plant allergens. Peptides similar to the 13cp in PN and TN allergens bound IgE from sera of patients allergic to PN and TN in peptide microarray analysis. The 13cp was used to produce a rabbit consensus peptide antibody (cpAB) that detected proteins containing repeats similar to the 13cp in western blots of various nut extracts, in which reactive proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The cpAB bound more specifically to allergens and nut extracts containing multiple repeats similar to the 13 cp, such as almond (Pru du 6), peanut (Ara h 2) and walnut (Jug r 2). IgE binding to various nut extracts is inhibited by recombinant J2LS sequence and synthetic 31cp. Thus, several repeated sequences similar to the 13cp are bound by IgE.

A total of 82 characteristic odors were identified using GC×GC-TOF/MS. Fifteen volatile compounds with the highest odor activity values (OAV > 100) were selected as the key odors contributing to the flavor profile of microwaved sesame oil, including 2-methyl-propanal (pungent, malt, green), 2-methyl-butanal (cocoa, almond), furaneol (caramel), 1-octen-3-one (mushroom), 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one (sweet), 1-nonanol (fat, citrus, green), 2-methyl-phenol (phenol), 2-methoxy-phenol (smoke, sweet), 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (clove, curry), 2,5-dimethyl-pyrazine (cocoa, roasted nut, roast beef), 2-furfurylthiol (coffee, roast), 2-thiophenemethanethiol (sulfur), methanethiol (gasoline, garlic), methional (cooked potato), and dimethyl trisulfide (fish, cabbage). The OAVs significantly increased with a longer microwave process. Meanwhile, PCA results based on E-nose and cluster analysis results based on GC×GC-TOF/MS were similar to distinguish flavor formation during the microwave process. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Sesame oils were prepared by a microwave process. Aroma-active compounds with the highest OAVs in sesame oils were not clear.

To investigate the changes in root protein function involved in the early response to drought stress, a proteomic analysis in combination to a physiological and biochemical analysis was performed in plants of 'Garnem', an almond × peach hybrid rootstock, subjected to short-term drought stress. Abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation levels increased during the drought exposure, which induced stomatal closure, and thus, minimised water losses. These effects were reflected in stomatal conductance and leaf water potential levels. However, 'Garnem' was able to balance water content and maintain an osmotic adjustment in cell membranes, suggesting a dehydration avoidance strategy. The proteomic analysis revealed significant abundance changes in 29 and 24 spots after 2 and 24 h of drought stress respectively. Out of these, 15 proteins were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The abundance changes of these proteins suggest the influence in drought-responsive mechanisms present in 'Garnem', allowing its adaptation to drought conditions.

30890205,"Western society is facing an increase in the number of food-allergic individuals, with rising incidence in the past years. Therefore, allergen-free food and accurate and reliable analysis of allergen contamination are essential for the protection of consumers. Yet, there is limited understanding on the effect of food processing on allergenicity and on the ability of available methods to detect trace contamination in processed food. Available studies addressing this have relied on sample processing on a laboratory scale. In this study, industry-like processing under precisely defined conditions (ranging from 110 to 150°C roasting temperatures) was employed to better understand the limitations of state-of-the-art methods for detecting traces of hazelnut and almond in processed food. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated an overall reduction in extracted proteins from roasted nut samples, and with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight Cor a 9 and Prunin, were identified as majorly expressed proteins for hazelnut and almond, respectively. A commercial ELISA kit detected nut traces only up to a 130°C roasting temperature. Untargeted MS (Orbitrap) analysis was able to detect traces of nuts roasted up to 150°C while also confirming Cor a 9 and Prunin as the major expressed proteins for hazelnut and almond, respectively. Preparing cookie dough spiked with roasted nut samples, a complex food matrix was simulated. Analysis by ELISA showed the same limitations encountered for pure nuts samples, hardly detecting traces of nuts roasted above 130°C. Targeted MS (linear ion trap) using multiple reaction monitoring methods for one proteotypic peptide for Cor a 9 and Prunin, respectively, enabled a detection of nut traces up to 150°C. The results indicated that a reduced extractability because of temperature-related effects (e.g., protein denaturation, cross-linking, poor solubility) caused the significant differences between the ELISA and MS analysis. Overall, the results of this study may form the basis to improve allergen detection after roasting through improved extraction methods and refined ELISA formats.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D000485', 'D000595', 'D031211', 'D004591', 'D004797', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D009754', 'D010940', 'D000068181', 'D019032', 'D053719', 'D013696']","['Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Corylus', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Nuts', 'Plant Proteins', 'Prunus dulcis', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Temperature']",Investigation of Reduced ELISA Recovery of Almond and Hazelnut Traces from Roasted Nut Samples by SDS-PAGE and Mass Spectrometry.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None]","['analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890205,2020
30400601,"Almond is consumed worldwide and renowned as a valuable healthy food. Despite this, it is also a potent source of allergenic proteins that can trigger several mild to life-threatening immunoreactions. Food processing proved to alter biochemical characteristics of proteins, thus affecting the respective allergenicity. In this paper, we investigated the effect of autoclaving, preceded or not by a hydration step, on the biochemical and immunological properties of almond proteins. Any variation in the stability and immunoreactivity of almond proteins extracted from the treated materials were evaluated by total protein quantification, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and protein profiling by electrophoresis-based separation (SDS-PAGE). The sole autoclaving applied was found to weakly affect almond protein stability, despite what was observed when hydration preceded autoclaving, which resulted in a loss of approximately 70% of total protein content compared to untreated samples, and a remarkable reduction of the final immunoreactivity. The final SDS-PAGE protein pattern recorded for hydrated and autoclaved almonds disclosed significant changes. In addition, the same samples were further submitted to human-simulated gastro-intestinal (GI) digestion to evaluate potential changes induced by these processing methods on allergen digestibility. Digestion products were identified by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS/MS) analysis followed by software-based data mining, and complementary information was provided by analyzing the proteolytic fragments lower than 6 kDa in size. The autoclave-based treatment was found not to alter the allergen digestibility, whereas an increased susceptibility to proteolytic action of digestive enzymes was observed in almonds subjected to autoclaving of prehydrated almond kernels. Finally, the residual immunoreactivity of the GI-resistant peptides was in-silico investigated by bioinformatic tools. Results obtained confirm that by adopting both approaches, no epitopes associated with known allergens survived, thus demonstrating the potential effectiveness of these treatments to reduce almond allergenicity.",Nutrients,"['D000485', 'D002851', 'D004063', 'D004591', 'D004797', 'D005511', 'D005512', 'D006358', 'D006801', 'D008970', 'D009754', 'D014674', 'D011312', 'D055550', 'D000068181', 'D053719']","['Allergens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Digestion', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Food Handling', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuts', 'Plant Proteins, Dietary', 'Pressure', 'Protein Stability', 'Prunus dulcis', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Heat and Pressure Treatments on Almond Protein Stability and Change in Immunoreactivity after Simulated Human Digestion.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000517', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'prevention & control', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30400601,2019

Selling and buying human milk via the Internet has gained popularity. However, there is a risk of human milk sold containing other adulterants such as animal or plant milk. Analytical tools for rapid detection of adulterants in human milk are needed. We report a quantitative metabolomics method for detecting potential milk adulterants (soy, almond, cow, goat and infant formula milk) in human milk. It is based on the use of a high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS platform to profile the metabolome of an unknown milk sample, followed by multivariate or univariate comparison of the resultant metabolomic profile with that of human milk to determine the differences. Using dansylation LC-MS to profile the amine/phenol submetabolome, we could detect an average of 4129 ± 297 (n = 9) soy metabolites, 3080 ± 470 (n = 9) almond metabolites, 4256 ± 136 (n = 18) cow metabolites, 4318 ± 198 (n = 9) goat metabolites, 4444 ± 563 (n = 9) infant formula metabolites, and 4020 ± 375 (n = 30) human metabolites.

Application of gc/olfactometry and the aroma extract dilution analysis revealed 44 odor-active compounds, 42 of which could be identified. The highest odor activity value of 2048 was established for the green, grassy (Z)-3-hexenal, the metallic smelling trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal, the potato-like 3-(methylthio)propanal, and the caramel-like 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone. Of the further odorants, 13 compounds have previously not been reported as tomato odorants. Although most of these showed lower FD-factors, in particular, the coconut/dill-like smelling wine lactone ((3S,3aS,7aR)-3a,4,5,7a-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethylbenzofuran-2(3H)-one) appeared with a quite high FD factor. In addition, a fruity, almond-like odorant (6) with an FD factor of 1024 was detected. By application of high resolution mass spectrometry and polarity considerations, the structure of a methyl-2-ethoxytetrahydropyran isomer was suggested for 6. Four of the five possible isomers, the 3-methyl-, 4-methyl-, 5-methyl-, and 6-methyl-2-ethoxytetrahydropyran were synthesized and showed similar mass spectrometric patterns. However, these were excluded by their different retention indices. Although the synthesis of the remaining 2-methyl-2-ethoxytetrahydropyran resulted in only small yields, which were not sufficient for NMR measurements, this structure is very likely for 6.

26769163,"Beginning in the autumn of 2014, millions of dollars of food and over 675 products were recalled in the United States due to the presence of undeclared peanut, attributed to cumin used in the manufacture of the products. Initial analyses also indicated the presence of almond. Subsequent research showed that the presence of peanut and almond did not fully explain the analytical results for the cumin samples. Using a combination of mass spectrometry, DNA-based methods (i.e., PCR and Sanger DNA Sequencing), microscopy, and antibody-based technologies (i.e., ELISA, Western blot analysis, and a novel xMAP multiplex assay) the presence of peanut was confirmed. Screening for secondary sources of adulteration (e.g., tree nuts, mahleb, peach, and cherry) supported the assessment that the cumin contained multiple contaminants. These results demonstrate the limitations of single analyte-specific assays and the need for orthogonal multiplex methods to detect food allergens irrespective of varietal or other differences.

25814275,"To help safeguard the food supply and detect the presence of undeclared food allergens and gluten, most producers and regulatory agencies rely on commercial test kits. Most of these are ELISAs with a few being PCR-based. These methods are very sensitive and analyte specific, requiring different assays to detect each of the different food allergens. Mass spectrometry offers an alternative approach whereby multiple allergens may be detected simultaneously. However, mass spectrometry requires expensive equipment, highly trained analysts, and several years before a quantitative approach can be achieved. Using multianalyte profiling (xMAP®) technology, a commercial multiplex test kit based on the use of established antibodies was developed for the simultaneous detection of up to 14 different food allergens plus gluten. The assay simultaneously detects crustacean seafood, egg, gluten, milk, peanut, soy, and nine tree nuts (almond, Brazil nut, cashew, coconut, hazelnut, macadamia, pine nut, pistachio, and walnut). By simultaneously performing multiple tests (typically two) for each analyte, this magnetic bead-based assay offers built-in confirmatory analyses without the need for additional resources. Twenty-five of the assays were performed on buffer extracted samples, while five were conducted on samples extracted using reduced-denatured conditions. Thus, complete analysis for all 14 allergens and gluten requires only two wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. This makes it possible to include in a single analytical run up to 48 samples. All 30 bead sets in this multiplex assay detected 5 ng/mL of food allergen and gluten with responses greater than background. In addition, 26 of the bead sets displayed signal/noise ratios of five or greater.

25658292,"Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTP) were shown to be among the most significant allergens, in particular in several fruits belonging to the Rosaceae family. The molecular features of LTPs, such as the presence of eight cysteine residues forming four disulfide bridges, confer a compact structure, decreasing the probability of degradation due to cooking or digestion, thereby increasing the chance of systemic absorption and severe allergic reactions. Few studies on LTP-induced allergies regarding almond (Prunus dulcis L) are available in the literature. In the present work, we describe for the first time the extraction and purification of an almond LTP, achieving its full characterisation by using liquid chromatography and exact mass spectrometry; the full sequence was identified by means of LC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS applying a bottom-up approach. The characterised protein consists of 92 amino acids and has a calculated exact MW of 9579.0. The presence of four disulfide bridges was confirmed after reduction, as shown by a mass increment of 8 Da. Finally, its potential allergenicity was confirmed via an in silico approach.

Samples were analysed for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2 using immunoaffinity column clean-up (IC) and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. Among the samples analysed, AFB1 was detected in 13.4% of the samples above the maximum limit (ML) as set in Iran (5 µg/kg). Total AF (AFT) was above the ML in 9.8% of the samples. This study showed that full consideration is equally essential for nuts used as ingredients in special food products such as the Gaz sweets as for nuts for direct human consumption.

A simple and rapid method was developed to detect 26 mycotoxins (aflatoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins, trichothecenes, and ergot alkaloids) in corn, rice, wheat, almond, peanut, and pistachio products using high-performance liquid chromatography-triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry. Test portions of homogenized grain or nut products were extracted with acetonitrile/water (85:15, v/v), followed by high-speed centrifugation and dilution with water. Mean recoveries (± standard deviations) were 84 ± 6, 89 ± 6, 97 ± 9, 87 ± 12, 104 ± 16, and 92 ± 18% from corn, rice, wheat, almond, peanut, and pistachio products, respectively, and the matrix-dependent instrument quantitation limits ranged from 0.2 to 12.8 μg/kg, depending on the mycotoxin. Matrix effects, as measured by the slope ratios of matrix-matched and solvent-only calibration curves, revealed primarily suppression and were more pronounced in nuts than in grains. The measured mycotoxin concentrations in 11 corn and wheat reference materials were not different from the certified concentrations. Nineteen mycotoxins were identified and measured in 35 of 70 commercial grain and nut products, ranging from 0.3 ± 0.1 μg/kg (aflatoxin B1 in peanuts) to 1143 ± 87 μg/kg (fumonisin B1 in corn flour).

23498967,"Tree nuts are a widely consumed food. Although enjoyed safely by most individuals, allergic reactions to tree nuts, including almond, are not uncommon. Almond prunin (Pru du 6), an 11S globulin (legumin), is an abundant nut seed protein and a major allergen. Conformational epitope mapping studies of prunin have been performed with a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4C10. This mAb reacts with non-reduced but not reduced prunin in immunoblotting assays, indicating the recognition of a conformational epitope. 4C10 competes with patient IgE, as assessed by ELISA, indicating clinical significance of the epitope. To characterize the 4C10 epitope, hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) monitored by 14.5 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on the native prunin-4C10 complex and on uncomplexed native prunin. Several epitope candidate peptides that differ in deuterium uptake between the complexed and uncomplexed forms were identified. The epitope was further mapped by analyzing chimeric molecules incorporating segments of the homologous soybean allergen, Gly m 6, in immunoassays.

A total of 200 husk samples and 200 almond samples were inoculated onto Aspergillus flavus-parasiticus agar for the detection of fungi. Mycotoxins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mycobiota comprised the following fungi, in decreasing order of frequency: almonds - Phialemonium spp. (54%), Penicillium spp. (16%), Fusarium spp. (13%), Phaeoacremonium spp. (11%), and Aspergillus spp. (4%), husks - Phialemonium spp. (62%), Phaeoacremonium spp. (11%), Penicillium spp. (10%), Fusarium spp. (9%), and Aspergillus spp. A polyphasic approach was used for identification of Aspergillus species. Aflatoxins were detected in 22 (11%) of the 200 almond samples, with 21 samples presenting aflatoxin B(1) levels above 8μg/kg, the limit established by the European Commission for Brazil nuts for further processing.

This method was further used to follow β-glucosidase degradation and product formation as progress curves. This approach allowed us to compare the kinetic characteristics of β-glucosidase on each exclusive oligosaccharide substrate and their mixtures. Our results show that when determining the kinetic parameters of exohydrolases on oligosaccharides following the progress curve for the substrates is necessary since calculations based only on released monosaccharide products may lead to an error. The catalytic activity of almond β-glucosidase on laminaribiose (G3G) was approximately half that measured against cellobiose (3.15 S(-1)).

Raw pasteurized almonds were roasted in a microwave for 1 to 3 min, in an oven at 177 °C for 5, 10, 15, and 20 min; and at 135 and 163 °C for 20 min, and in oil at 135, 163, and 177 °C for 5 min and 177 °C for 10 min. Volatile compounds were quantified in the headspace of ground almonds, both raw and roasted, by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry. Strong correlations were found between L value, chroma, and 5-(hydroxy methyl)-2- furfural; and were independent of roasting method. Raw almonds had lower concentrations of most volatiles than roasted almonds. Conditions that produced color equivalent to commercial samples were 2 min in the microwave, 5 min at 177 °C in the oven, and 5 min at 135 °C in oil. Microwave heating produced higher levels of most volatiles than oven and oil roasting at commercial color. Sensory evaluation indicated that microwave-roasted almonds had the strongest aroma and were the most preferred. Oil-roasted almonds showed significantly lower levels of volatiles than other methods, likely due to loss of these volatiles into the oil. Alcohols such as benzyl alcohols and strecker aldehydes including benzaldehyde and methional were at higher concentrations than other volatiles in roasted almonds.

21488490,"High ground-level ozone continues to be an important human, animal, and plant health impediment in the United States and especially in California's San Joaquin Valley (SJV). According to California state and regional air quality agencies, dairies are one of the major sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the SJV. A number of recently conducted studies reported emissions data from different dairy sources. However, limited data are currently available for silage and otherfeed storages on dairies, which could potentially contribute to ozone formation. Because the impact of different VOCs on ozone formation varies significantly from one molecular species to another, detailed characterization of VOC emissions is essential to include all the important contributors to atmospheric chemistry and especially atmospheric reactivity. The present research study identifies and quantifies the VOCs emitted from various silages and other feedstuffs. Experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber under controlled conditions. Almost 80 VOCs were identified and quantified from corn (Zea mays L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.),and cereal (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] and oat [Avena sativava L.] grains) silages, total mixed ration (TMR), almond (Amygdalus communis L.) shells and hulls using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography.

The method was based on our earlier published LC-MS(2)-based method in a research frame aimed at the identification and determination of hidden allergens in foods by using selective biomarker peptides. A C18 particle-packed column and a silica-based C18 monolithic column were compared in terms of chromatographic performances, such as peak shape, resolution, analysis time and selectivity. The C18 particle-packed column exhibited better performances and was further used for method development and validation. By operating under MS(2) selected reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition mode, linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation, trueness and precision were evaluated on breakfast samples enriched with a mix of the five nuts. Good linearity of the matrix matched-calibration curves was obtained and detection limit values generally varied from 14 to 55 mg nut/kg matrix. Recoveries were in the 76±4% to 94±3% range with RSD <15%. The capabilities of LIT to perform MS(n) fragmentation was exploited to improve selectivity of the analysis, and the LC-(SRM) MS(2) method was compared in terms of LOD, linearity, precision and accuracy with a LC-(SRM) MS(3) method.

Because these limits vary widely from one country to another, the Codex Alimentarius Commission, working through the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants, has initiated work to harmonize aflatoxin limits and sampling plans for almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts, and Brazil nuts. Studies were developed to measure the uncertainty and distribution among test results for replicate samples taken from aflatoxin-contaminated almond shipments. The uncertainty and distribution information was used to develop a model to evaluate the performance of aflatoxin sampling plans so that harmonized sampling plans can be developed for almonds that reduce the misclassifying of lots in the export trade. Twenty lots of shelled almonds were sampled according to an experimental protocol in which sixteen 10 kg samples were taken from each lot. The observed aflatoxin distribution among the 16 sample test results was compared with 3 theoretical distributions. The negative binomial distribution was selected to model aflatoxin distribution among sample test results because it gave acceptable fits across all 20 observed sample distributions.

To guarantee its safety, the occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in artisanal Palmero cheese smoked with 2 types of vegetable matter (almond shells and dry prickly pear) was studied. The determination of PAH includes extraction and clean-up steps, followed by separation, identification, and quantification of PAH by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in selected ion-monitoring mode. The most abundant PAH are those with 2 and 3 aromatic rings. Although the highest total PAH concentrations corresponded to the cheeses smoked with almond shells, the degree of PAH contamination of the cheeses studied was lower than that found in other cheeses smoked in the traditional way. The nature of the vegetable material used for smoking seemed to have an influence on the type of PAH formed, especially on alkylderivatives and some light PAH. However, despite the artisanal, and consequently variable, production process of these cheeses, many similarities have been found among their PAH profiles. In fact, relatively constant relationships are observed between the concentrations of certain pairs of PAH. Benzo(a)pyrene was only present in 2 samples, and in much lower concentrations than the maximum allowed legal limits.

16915840,"Domestic and international regulatory limits have been established for aflatoxin in almonds and other tree nuts. It is difficult to obtain an accurate and precise estimate of the true aflatoxin concentration in a bulk lot because of the uncertainty associated with the sampling, sample preparation, and analytical steps of the aflatoxin test procedure. To evaluate the performance of aflatoxin sampling plans, the uncertainty associated with sampling lots of shelled almonds for aflatoxin was investigated. Twenty lots of shelled almonds were sampled for aflatoxin contamination. The total variance associated with measuring B1 and total aflatoxins in bulk almond lots was estimated and partitioned into sampling, sample preparation, and analytical variance components. All variances were found to increase with an increase in aflatoxin concentration (both B1 and total). By using regression analysis, mathematical expressions were developed to predict the relationship between each variance component (total, sampling, sample preparation, and analysis variances) and aflatoxin concentration. Variance estimates were the same for B1 and total aflatoxins. The mathematical relationships can be used to estimate each variance for a given sample size, subsample size, and number of analyses other than that measured in the study.

16819912,"Limited information is available concerning the qualitative and quantitative composition of polyphenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, in almonds. We determined total phenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids in California almond (Prunus dulcis) skins and kernels among the principal almond varieties (Butte, Carmel, Fritz, Mission, Monterey, Nonpareil, Padre, and Price) with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrochemical detection and UV detection. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry under identical HPLC conditions was utilized to verify identities of the predominant flavonoids and phenolic acids. Total phenols ranged from 127 (Fritz) to 241 (Padre) mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g of fresh weight. The analyses were compiled to produce a data set of 18 flavonoids and three phenolic acids. The predominant flavonoids were isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside (in combination), catechin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, epicatechin, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside at 16.81, 1.93, 1.17, 0.85, 0.83, and 0.50 mg/100 g of fresh weight almonds, respectively. Using the existing approach of calculating only the aglycone form of flavonoids for use in the U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrient database, whole almonds would provide the most prevalent aglycones of isorhamnetin at 11.70 (3.32), kaempferol at 0.60 (0.17), catechin at 1.93 (0.55), quercetin at 0.72 (0.20), and epicatechin at 0.85 (0.24) mg/100 g of fresh weight (mg/oz serving), respectively.

16713079,"Sorption with activated carbon has been the technique preferred for pentachlorophenol (PCP) removal from contaminated waters, but regeneration needs and high operation costs are supporting a renewed interest in the search for alternative sorbents. Among them, almond shell, an agricultural by-product, provides interesting economical advantages, once shells account for 50% (in mass) of the whole almond. In this work, the capacity of almond shells to remove PCP from waters without previous activation was studied in batch conditions. While PCP analysis was performed solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD), mercury porosimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provided a preliminary physical and chemical characterization of the sorbent. Almond shells were essentially a macroporous material, with an average surface area of 12.9+/-2.8 m2/g. The efficiency of PCP removal was 93+/-14%, in 24 h, with an initial concentration of 100 microg/l PCP and 5 microg PCP/g shell. Isotherm data adjusted better to Freundlich equation, where K(F) and 1/n were 0.075+/-0.081 mg(1-1/n) l(1/n) and 1.882+/-0.289, respectively.

11386670,"Procyanidins are phenolic oligomers, mainly composed of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin units that exhibit certain sensorial and physiological properties of interest (e.g., astringency and bitterness of food, antioxidant activity, etc.). This paper shows the development of a micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method for the separation of three procyanidin dimers (B1, B2, and B3), their monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), and the cis- and trans-forms of p-coumaric acid. Separation conditions are optimized in terms of buffer pH, SDS concentration, and washing routine between injections. The best results in terms of peak resolution and reproducibility between separations were obtained with a MEKC running buffer at pH 5 with 100 mM SDS and a washing routine that includes a rinse step with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. Using this new MEKC method it is possible to separate in less than 5 min the seven substances. More interestingly, it is demonstrated that the low pH used in this MEKC method allows one to obtain clean electropherograms when samples are injected. The method is shown to be reproducible between different days with relative standard deviation (RSD) values lower than 1% for migration times and lower than 7% for peak areas (3 days, 24 injections). The usefulness of this procedure to determine these compounds in effluents from food processing (i.e., soaking water from lentils, white beans and black beans) and in food by-products (i.e., almond peels) considered as potential procyanidin sources is demonstrated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of separation and determination of procyanidins in food samples done by capillary electrophoresis.",Electrophoresis,"['D044946', 'D002392', 'D020374', 'D007887', 'D015394', 'D010636', 'D010946', 'D044945', 'D015203', 'D013997']","['Biflavonoids', 'Catechin', 'Chromatography, Micellar Electrokinetic Capillary', 'Fabaceae', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phenols', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Time Factors']",Fast determination of procyanidins and other phenolic compounds in food samples by micellar electrokinetic chromatography using acidic buffers.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11386670,2001
11358875,"The N-glycans from 27 ""plant"" foodstuffs, including one from a gymnospermic plant and one from a fungus, were prepared by a new procedure and examined by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). For several samples, glycan structures were additionally investigated by size-fractionation and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with exoglycosidase digests and finally also (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The glycans found ranged from the typical vacuolar ""horseradish peroxidase"" type and oligomannose to complex Le(a)-carrying structures. Though the common mushroom exclusively contained N-glycans of the oligomannosidic type, all plant foods contained mixtures of the above-mentioned types. Apple, asparagus, avocado, banana, carrot, celery, hazelnut, kiwi, onion, orange, pear, pignoli, strawberry, and walnut were particularly rich in Le(a)-carrying N-glycans. Although traces of Le(a)-containing structures were also present in almond, pistachio, potato, and tomato, no such glycans could be found in cauliflower. Coconut exhibited almost exclusively N-glycans containing only xylose but no fucose. Oligomannosidic N-glycans dominated in buckwheat and especially in the legume seeds mung bean, pea, peanut, and soybean. Papaya presented a unique set of hybrid type structures partially containing the Le(a) determinant.

The samples were of cereal and cereal product, fats and oils, nuts and nut products, seeds, spices and herbs, pickles, sauces and a variety of canned vegetable and/or pickle products. Low concentrations of mycotoxins were present in many samples analysed. The types and levels of mycotoxins present varied with the type of sample. The most common contaminants were the trichothecenes and ochratoxin A. Trace levels of aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, fumonisins and trichothecenes were detected in samples containing cereal, such as rice, noodles, corn flour and pitta bread. Trace levels of aflatoxins and zearalenone were detected in a sample of chili oil and ochratoxin A in a sample of sesame oil. Only one sample of nut (almond) contained aflatoxin while aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol (a trichothecene) were detected in various seeds.

In experiment 1, rats were divided into three groups and ICV infused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (a-CSF) or b-SAT: group 1, a-CSF (n = 11); group 2, 20 micrograms/rat, b-SAT (n = 11); and group 3, 40 micrograms/rat, b-SAT (n = 9). Infusions were repeated thrice three days apart. Compared to a-CSF, the high b-SAT dose suppressed food intake for 24-h after each successive infusion. The low dose significantly decreased food intake only after the first infusion. Water intake was suppressed only after the first injection of the high dose. Body weight was decreased after the first and second infusions of both doses and following the third infusion of the high dose. In experiment 2, rats were trained to drink fluid for 1 h/day while food was ad lib. On day 1, both groups received no infusions and were given tap water.

1110492,"In a survey of California almonds, aflatoxin was found in 14% of 74 samples of unsorted, in-shell almonds as received by the processor in 1972, but it occurred at very low levels (below 20 parts per billion (ppb)) in 90% of the contaminated samples. The overall proportion of individual nuts contaminated was especially low and is estimated with 95% probability to have been in the range of 1 nut/55,300 nuts to 1 nut/14,700 nuts. Aflatoxin contamination is not restriced to any particular section of the almond-growing region of California. Commercial sorting procedures are effective in removing most aflatoxin-contaminated nutmeats, since none of 26 samples of processed, whole nutmeats contained aflatoxin. In contrast, 13 of 27 samples of diced almonds were contaminated, but nine of these 13 samples contained less than 20 ppb. Only one of 25 samples of sliced nutmeats contained aflatoxin (4 ppb). Thus, aflatoxin incidence in almonds varies greatly with the category of finished product. The apparent high incidence in diced nutmeats is probably due mostly to the more uniform distribution of aflatoxin occurring in this product (because of its small particle size) than that occurring in the other products.
