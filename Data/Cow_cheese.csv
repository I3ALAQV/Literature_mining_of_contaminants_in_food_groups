30744868,"In the dairy industry, substitution of high priced milk species with low priced ones is a common practice, and determination of milk species is critical. In this study, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) method was developed for identification of milk species in fermented dairy products (yoghurt and cheese). Three partial least square-discriminant analysis models were developed in order to identify pure-mixed samples, milk species and binary mixture type, and partial least square (PLS) model was utilized to quantify the mixing ratio in binary mixtures. PLS models used for yoghurt and cheese samples showed that detection limits of adulteration were below 3.3%. Apart from the buffalo-cow yoghurt and goat-cow cheese, precision of the measurements was found to be below 6.2. It can be said that SFS technique is applicable on yoghurt and cheese samples as it's a less destructive and a less costly method compared to DNA and protein based conventional methods.",Food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002020', 'D002417', 'D002611', 'D043302', 'D004247', 'D003612', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D006041', 'D016018', 'D057230', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D012756', 'D013045', 'D013050', 'D015014']","['Animals', 'Buffaloes', 'Cattle', 'Cheese', 'Cultured Milk Products', 'DNA', 'Dairying', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Goats', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Limit of Detection', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Sheep', 'Species Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Yogurt']","Identification of cow, buffalo, goat and ewe milk species in fermented dairy products using synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy.","[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744868,2019
