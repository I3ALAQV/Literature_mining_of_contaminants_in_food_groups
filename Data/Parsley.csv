34829641,"Culinary spices and herbs have been used to impart a characteristic flavour and aroma in food due to their appealing fragrance. Recently, bioactive compounds from herbs, especially phenolics, have gained much attention due to their potential health outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize and quantify the phenolic compounds from 10 widely used Australian-grown herbs (oregano, rosemary, bay, basil, sage, fenugreek, dill, parsley, mint and thyme). For this purpose, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for the complete profiling of polyphenolic compounds and quantification of abundant phenolic compounds was completed with high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA). Polyphenols from Australian-grown herbs were estimated through total phenolic content (TP), total flavonoids (TF) and total tannins (TT) along with their in-vitro antioxidant activities. Oregano and mint were estimated with the highest value of TP (140.59 ± 9.52 and 103.28 ± 8.08 mg GAE/g, milligram gallic acid equivalent/gram) while rosemary and mint had the highest TF (8.19 ± 0.74 and 7.05 ± 0.43 mg QE (quercetin equivalent)/g). In this study, eighty-four (84) phenolic compounds were screened and confirmed through LC-MS/MS by comparing their masses and fragmentation pattern with published libraries. The results of this study validate the use of these herbs as bioactives and their positive impact on human health.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],LC-MS/MS-QTOF Screening and Identification of Phenolic Compounds from Australian Grown Herbs and Their Antioxidant Potential.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34829641,2021
33509486,"A rapid shot-gun method by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) is proposed for the characterization of fennel proteins. After enzymatic digestion with trypsin, few microliters of extract were analyzed by direct infusion in positive ion mode. A custom-made non-redundant fennel-specific proteome database was derived from the well-known NCBI database; additional proteins belonging to recognized allergenic sources (celery, carrot, parsley, birch, and mugwort) were also included in our database, since patients hypersensitive to these plants could also suffer from fennel allergy. The peptide sequence of each protein from that derived list was theoretically sequenced to produce calculated m/z lists of possible m/z ions after tryptic digestions. Then, by using a home-made Matlab algorithm, those lists were matched with the experimental FT-ICR mass spectrum of the fennel peptide mixture. Finally, Peptide Mass Fingerprint searches confirmed the presence of the matched proteins inside the fennel extract with a total of 70 proteins (61 fennel specific and 9 allergenic proteins).","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D017357', 'D030001', 'D005583', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D010449']","['Cyclotrons', 'Foeniculum', 'Fourier Analysis', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Peptide Mapping']",Investigation of fennel protein extracts by shot-gun Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509486,2021
33174278,"The aim of this study was to isolate monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDGs) and digalactosyldiacylglycerols (DGDGs) from perilla [Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton] and to investigate their fatty acid profiles. Perilla displayed the greatest total MGDG and DGDG content among the three types of leaf vegetables tested, that is, spinach, parsley, and perilla, containing 0.16 g/100 g MGDG and 0.04 g/100 g DGDG (on wet weight basis). High purity MGDG (approximately 97 g/100 g) and DGDG (approximately 86 g/100 g) were isolated from perilla chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) extracts by two-step silica gel column chromatography. MGDGs were primarily composed of 18:3n-3 and 16:3n-3, predominantly located at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, respectively. In DGDG, 18:3n-3 and 16:0 were the most abundant fatty acids and were primarily found at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, respectively. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: MGDGs and DGDGs are the most prevalent forms of galactoglycerolipids found in leaf vegetables including perilla and have been shown to exert health-beneficial effects, such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and appetite-suppressing activities. Both MGDGs and DGDGs possess emulsifying properties. The present study may help better understand the health-beneficial effects of MGDG and DGDG from perilla, by providing total composition and positional distribution of the fatty acids.

30993530,"Metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Preclinical studies on recently discovered classes of lipids - fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) have revealed their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing potential. The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (palmitic, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic acid hydroxy stearic acid (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial metabolic effects. In contrary, the PAHSA - previously proven to have the strongest antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, was not present in some foods (radish, avocado, mango, lemon, cherry tomato, kiwi).

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the distribution of furocoumarins in popularly consumed foods in the U.S. Samples of three varieties of each of 29 foods known or suspected to contain furocoumarins were purchased, prepared for analysis using a solid phase extraction method, and analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS for the presence of seven major furocoumarins. Most foods measured contained more than one furocoumarin, and some contained all seven of the furocoumarins examined. Total furocoumarin concentration was greatest in fresh parsley (23215 ng/g), grapefruits (21858 ng/g), lime juice (14580 ng/g), grapefruit juice (95341 ng/g), and limes (9151 ng/g).

Hence, it is desirable to develop easy, sensitive and fast analytical screening methods for the determination of AgNPs in complex biological matrices. This study describes such a method using solid sampling high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). A recently reported novel evaluation strategy uses the atomization delay of the respective GFAAS signal as significant indicator for AgNPs and thereby allows discrimination of AgNPs from ionic silver (Ag(+)) in the samples without elaborate sample pre-treatment. This approach was further developed and applied to a variety of biological samples. Its suitability was approved by investigation of eight different food samples (parsley, apple, pepper, cheese, onion, pasta, maize meal and wheat flour) spiked with ionic silver or AgNPs. Furthermore, the migration of AgNPs from silver-impregnated polypropylene food storage boxes to fresh pepper was observed and a mussel sample obtained from a laboratory exposure study with silver was investigated. The differences in the atomization delays (Δt(ad)) between silver ions and 20-nm AgNPs vary in a range from -2.01 ± 1.38 s for maize meal to +2.06 ± 1.08 s for mussel tissue. However, the differences were significant in all investigated matrices and so indicative of the presence/absence of AgNPs.

The potential of raw and modified material as a magnetically separable sorbent in selective enrichment of lead ions from water and food samples is outlined. This material was characterised using FT-IR, XRD, SEM and VSM techniques. The SEM and VSM results indicated that the calcium ferrite nanoparticles are sphere-like particles possessing superparamagnetic properties with an average diameter of 40 nm. Various analytical parameters, including pH, contact time, type and concentration of eluent, adsorption capacity, sample volume and interference of ions, were optimised. Following a modification by anhydride, calcium ferrite selectivity toward lead ions was raised more than twofold compared to the unmodified nanoparticles.

24645516,"Functional and quantitative evaluation of analytes in crude extracts or semipure mixtures has been considered challenging due to variation in generated results. Some of the drawbacks have been linked to the texture, form, and content of the samples. The crude extracts contain multiple components and, in oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays, have exhibited complex reaction kinetics due to interference or matrix effect. The conventional ORAC assay utilized a single dilution factor that brought about a wide CV difference (60-110%) in antioxidant activity for each extract compared to other dilution factors applied. Due to precision errors introduced from these extremely high CV% differences, determination of antioxidant capacity based on a single dilution may introduce discrepant results. A novel standardized ORAC (SORAC) assay for the determination of antioxidant capacity of dietary plant extracts is described in this study. Using the SORAC assay, positive linear correlations (R2 = 0.95-0.99) were obtained for the sample extracts tested when a multiple dilution strategy was applied. Thus, on the strength of our observations, SORAC has been proposed as an effective tool for assessing antioxidant analytes in a biological matrix.

24592995,"The ability of foods and beverages to reduce allyl methyl disulfide, diallyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, and allyl methyl sulfide on human breath after consumption of raw garlic was examined. The treatments were consumed immediately following raw garlic consumption for breath measurements, or were blended with garlic prior to headspace measurements. Measurements were done using a selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometer. Chlorophyllin treatment demonstrated no deodorization in comparison to the control. Successful treatments may be due to enzymatic, polyphenolic, or acid deodorization. Enzymatic deodorization involved oxidation of polyphenolic compounds by enzymes, with the oxidized polyphenols causing deodorization. This was the probable mechanism in raw apple, parsley, spinach, and mint treatments. Polyphenolic deodorization involved deodorization by polyphenolic compounds without enzymatic activity. This probably occurred for microwaved apple, green tea, and lemon juice treatments. When pH is below 3.6, the enzyme alliinase is inactivated, which causes a reduction in volatile formation. This was demonstrated in pH-adjusted headspace measurements. However, the mechanism for volatile reduction on human breath (after volatile formation) is unclear, and may have occurred in soft drink and lemon juice breath treatments. Whey protein was not an effective garlic breath deodorant and had no enzymatic activity, polyphenolic compounds, or acidity. Headspace concentrations did not correlate well to breath treatments.

24459476,"Vegetables are an inevitable and important part of a healthy and balanced diet. They could be contaminated by heavy metals in many ways including irrigation by sewage water and industrial effluents sewage sludge, vehicular emissions, industrial waste and atmospheric deposition. In this study, we sought to determine if some vegetables (cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, lettuce, potatoes, onions, carrots, persian leeks, dill, spinach, coriander, parsley) grown locally in the suburban of Isfahan city and sold in the urban markets are contaminated with cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb). Vegetables were sampled from August to October 2010. After washing, they were oven-dried and digested using three-acid mixture (70% HNO3, 65% HClO4 and 70% H2SO4). Analyzes of the heavy metals was performed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. To validate the assay method, intra-day and inter-day variation studies were performed. The concentrations (μg/g) of heavy metals in the samples ranged from 0.00 to 3.66 for Cd, 0.00 to 6.00 for Cr and 0.00 to 7.14 for Pb. The highest concentration of heavy metals was for Pb. The results showed that the amount of Cd, Cr and Pb of some samples exceeded the recommended levels. The amount of Cd in cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes with skin, carrots, and spinach was significantly higher in the samples collected from Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms than those of Dorche farms. Also, the amount of Cr in onion, carrots, and spinach was significantly higher in samples collected from Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms than those of Dorche farms. However, the amount of Pb in the carrots and leek was significantly higher in the samples collected from Dorche farms than those of Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms. It can be concluded from the findings of this study that the amounts of Cd, Cr, and Pb were higher than the acceptable levels recommended by WHO/FAO. Also, higher amount of Cd and Cr in some samples collected from Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms compared to that of the samples collected from Dorche farms may indicate the influence of contaminants that enter ZayadeRood River as it passes Isfahan.

22560244,"Fine and ultrafine metallic particulate matters (PMs) are emitted from metallurgic activities in peri-urban zones into the atmosphere and can be deposited in terrestrial ecosystems. The foliar transfer of metals and metalloids and their fate in plant leaves remain unclear, although this way of penetration may be a major contributor to the transfer of metals into plants. This study focused on the foliar uptake of various metals and metalloids from enriched PM (Cu, Zn, Cd, Sn, Sb, As, and especially lead (Pb)) resulting from the emissions of a battery-recycling factory. Metal and metalloid foliar uptake by various vegetable species, exhibiting different morphologies, use (food or fodder) and life-cycle (lettuce, parsley and rye-grass) were studied. The mechanisms involved in foliar metal transfer from atmospheric particulate matter fallout, using lead (Pb) as a model element was also investigated. Several complementary techniques (micro-X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry) were used to investigate the localization and the speciation of lead in their edible parts, i.e. leaves. The results showed lead-enriched PM on the surface of plant leaves. Biogeochemical transformations occurred on the leaf surfaces with the formation of lead secondary species (PbCO(3) and organic Pb). Some compounds were internalized in their primary form (PbSO(4)) underneath an organic layer.

Evidence is mainly against all-E-beta-carotene, while there is no evidence against other carotenoids or against mixtures of beta-carotene stereoisomers. Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets. Population consumption patterns of carotenoid isomers using a comprehensive database are used to improve our understanding in disease prevention.

16076130,"Extrusion cooking processing followed by air-drying has been applied to obtain low-fat potato snacks. Optimal parameters were developed for a dough recipe. Dough contained apart from potato granules 7% of canola oil, 1% of salt, 1% of baking powder, 5% of maltodextrin, and 15% of wheat flour. After the extrusion process, snacks were dried at 85 degrees C for 15 min followed by 130 degrees C for 45 min. The potent odorants of extruded potato snacks were identified using aroma extract dilution analysis and gas chromatography-olfactometry. Among the characteristic compounds, methional with boiled potato flavor, benzenemethanethiol with pepper-seed flavor, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline with popcorn flavor, benzacetaldehyde with strong flowery flavor, butanal with rancid flavor, and 2-acetylpyrazine with roasty flavor were considered to be the main contributors to the aroma of extruded potato snacks. Several compounds were concluded to be developed during extrusion cooking, such as ethanol, 3-methylbutanal, (Z)-1,5-octadien-3-one with geranium flavor, and unknown ones with the flavor of boiled potato, cumin, candy, or parsley root.

10924904,"By using a hydroxyapatite column, the five major Photosystem I (PSI) subunits (PsaA,-B,-C,-D,-E) solubilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were fractionated from a spinach PSI reaction center preparation. Another small (5-6 kDa) polypeptide was also separated, and purified to homogeneity. Mass spectroscopy yielded its molecular weight to be 5942 +/- 10. This polypeptide had an N-terminal sequence homologous to those of previously reported 5-kDa subunits from spinach and wheat and a 6.1-kDa subunit of Chlamydomonas, which had all been assigned to Photosystem II (PSII) and designated as PsbW. However, we found similar 5-kDa polypeptides with highly conserved N-terminal sequences ubiquitously in PSI particles from other plants including Daikon (Raphanus sativus, Japanese radish), Chingensai (Brassica parachinensis, Chinese cabbage), parsley and Shungiku (Chrysanthemum coronarium, Garland chrysanthemum) as well. Preparations of spinach PSI particles prepared by using a mild detergent (digitonin) had this 5-kDa subunit, while PSII particles did not. Moreover, a bare-bone PSI reaction center preparation consisting of PsaA/B alone had a more than stoichiometric amount of this 5-kDa polypeptide. A mechanically (without detergent) fractionated stroma thylakoid preparation from Phytolacca americana, which lacked other PSII subunits, also contained this 5-kDa subunit. Thus, we propose that this 5-kDa polypeptide, previously designated as a PSII subunit (PsbW), is an integral subunit of PSI as well.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,"['D000595', 'D019661', 'D002845', 'D003902', 'D004072', 'D004591', 'D008565', 'D008969', 'D009687', 'D045322', 'D045331', 'D045332', 'D010940', 'D016415', 'D018724', 'D014908']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apiaceae', 'Chromatography', 'Detergents', 'Digitonin', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins', 'Photosystem I Protein Complex', 'Photosystem II Protein Complex', 'Plant Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Spinacia oleracea', 'Triticum']",Chromatographic separation of a small subunit (PsbW/PsaY) and its assignment to Photosystem I reaction center.,"[None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000302', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', None, 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10924904,2000
10858697,"This paper reports the compilation of a food composition database for phylloquinone (vitamin K1) derived from the direct analysis of foods, recipe calculation and the assignment of values based on food similarities. All the basic and other food items used in these calculations had been analysed by HPLC and about 170 of the items had been obtained and assayed in the UK. Recipe calculations took account of the cooking method and changes in water and fat content. Currently, approximately 1501 food items with Royal Society of Chemistry/Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food food codes have been allocated a vitamin K1 value, and a further 282 new recipe codes are included in the database. Representative values from each food group are reported together with an indication of the potential variation. Detailed examples of some recipe calculations are included, and also the impact of changing the type of fat in recipes. Vitamin K1 is associated with, and most abundant in, photosynthetic tissues of plants. Accordingly, the highest concentrations (3000-6000 micrograms/kg) are found in dark-green leafy vegetables and herbs, such as kale, parsley, spinach and green cabbage. Intermediate concentrations (1000-2000 micrograms/kg) are found in plants with paler leaves such as white cabbage and lettuce or in green, non-leafy vegetables such as broccoli and brussel sprouts. Fats and oils contain variable amounts of vitamin K1 with the highest concentrations (300-1300 micrograms/kg) in soyabean, rapeseed and olive oils and the margarines based on them. Other foods such as dairy products, meat dishes and cereal-based foods (bread, biscuits, cakes, desserts etc.), although not in themselves particularly rich in vitamin K1 (< 200 micrograms/kg), may contribute significantly to intakes when consumption of green vegetables is poor.
