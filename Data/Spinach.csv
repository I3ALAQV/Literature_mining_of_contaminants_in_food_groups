34945618,"Fresh baby spinach leaves are popular in salads and are sold as chilled and plastic-packed products. They are of high nutritional value but very perishable due to microbial contamination and enzymatic browning resulting from leaf senescence. Therefore, innovative food processing methods such as plasma-activated water (PAW) treatment are being explored regarding their applicability for ensuring food safety. PAW's impact on food quality and shelf-life extension has, however, not been investigated extensively in vegetables so far. In the present study, a comprehensive metabolomic analysis was performed to determine possible changes in the metabolite contents of spinach leaves stored in a refrigerated state for eight days. Liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, followed by stringent biostatistics, was used to compare the metabolomes in control, tap-water-rinsed or PAW-rinsed samples. No significant differences were discernible between the treatment groups at the beginning or end of the storage period. The observed loss of nutrients and activation of catabolic pathways were characteristic of a transition into the senescent state. Nonetheless, the presence of several polyphenolic antioxidants and γ-linolenic acid in the PAW-treated leaves indicated a significant increase in stress resistance and health-promoting antioxidant capacity in the sample. Furthermore, the enhancement of carbohydrate-related metabolisms indicated a delay in the senescence development. These findings demonstrated the potential of PAW to benefit food quality and the shelf-life of fresh spinach leaves.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Impact of Plasma-Activated Water Treatment on Quality and Shelf-Life of Fresh Spinach Leaves Evaluated by Comprehensive Metabolomic Analysis.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34945618,2021
34750742,"Soil and water from the trans-Himalayan high-altitude region contain high concentrations of various heavy metals. Vegetables and cereals such as cabbage, spinach, and wheat are most prone to heavy metal accumulation from soil and water which can be toxic for human consumption. It has yet to be studied how consumption of vegetables and cereal with excess heavy metal content can affect human health in high altitude areas. To this end, the objectives of this study are (a) quantify the concentrations of Aluminum (Al), Iron (Fe), Cobalt (Co), Boron (B), Lead (Pb), Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Selenium (Se), Copper (Cu), and Zinc (Zn) in three crops (wheat, cabbage, and spinach), and (b) evaluate the health risk of excess dietary heavy metal consumption in the local adult population using non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic parameters. A total of 60 samples were analyzed for minerals and potentially toxic elements using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). Results found that spinach has a high mineral content than wheat and cabbage. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of each metal in each crop was less than the limit of permissible value. The hazard index (HI) of three plant species, and target hazard quotient (THQ) were less than the threshold level (< 1).

34203867,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studying and exploring the potential health benefits of foods, mainly from vegetables and fruits from regular intake. The presence of secondary metabolites, namely polyphenols, carotenoids and terpenes, in certain food matrices seems to contribute to their functional properties, expressed through an increased prevention in the development of certain chronic diseases, namely coronary heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and diabetes. However, some foods' volatile secondary metabolites also present important bioactive properties, although this is a poorly scientifically explored field. In this context, and in order to explore the potential bioactivity of volatile metabolites in different vegetables and fruits from regular consumption, the volatile composition was established using a green extraction technique, solid phase microextraction in headspace mode (HS-SPME), combined with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 320 volatile metabolites, comprising 51 terpenic compounds, 45 organosulfur compounds, 31 aldehydes, 37 esters, 29 ketones, 28 alcohols, 23 furanic compounds, 22 hydrocarbons, 19 benzene compounds, 13 nitrogenous compounds, 9 carboxylic acids, 7 ethers, 4 halogenated compounds and 3 naphthalene derivatives, were positively identified. Each investigated fruit and vegetable showed a specific volatile metabolomic profile. The obtained results revealed that terpenic compounds, to which are associated antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities, are the most predominant chemical family in beetroot (61%), orange carrot (58%) and white carrot (61%), while organosulfur compounds (antiviral activity) are dominant in onion, garlic and watercress. Broccoli and spinach are essentially constituted by alcohols and aldehydes (enzyme-inhibition and antimicrobial properties), while fruits from the Solanaceae family are characterized by esters in tamarillo and aldehydes in tomato.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000438', 'D000447', 'D004952', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D007659', 'D055432', 'D052617', 'D013729', 'D014675', 'D055549']","['Alcohols', 'Aldehydes', 'Esters', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Ketones', 'Metabolomics', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Terpenes', 'Vegetables', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Relationship between Volatile Composition and Bioactive Potential of Vegetables and Fruits of Regular Consumption-An Integrative Approach.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203867,2021

33483837,"The use of macro- and microalgae, as well as cyanobacteria, becomes increasingly important for human nutrition, even in Western diets. Health effects, positive as well as negative, are believed to result mainly from minor components in the food. In macro- and microalgae as well as in certain cyanobacteria, one class of such minor compounds is sulfolipids, more precisely sulfoquinovosylmonoacylglycerol (SQMG) and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) derivatives. SQMGs and SQDGs consist of a diacylglycerol esterified with varying fatty acid combinations and a sulfoquinovose moiety. Sulfoquinovose is a sulfonated hexose analogous to D-glucose, but featuring a stable carbon-sulfur bond. With regard to their chemical structure, SQDGs can be distinguished according to their sn1- and sn2-bound fatty acids. Although there is great interest in SQDGs, because of their controversially discussed bioactivities, only a negligible number of comprehensive methods for identification and quantification has been published, so far. Within this work, a sample preparation including a quantitative isolation of SQDGs from selected raw materials, a clean-up with solid-phase extraction (SPE), and a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous identification and quantitation of different, intact SQMGs and SQDGs were developed and validated. The applicability of the method was further demonstrated by comparing a prominent cyanobacterium (Arthrospira sp.) with a microalgae preparation (Chlorella vulgaris), and selected leafy vegetables (spinach, basil).",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002138', 'D002244', 'D002708', 'D002851', 'D002853', 'D000458', 'D004075', 'D006017', 'D007477', 'D008055', 'D058086', 'D018515', 'D015203', 'D052616', 'D012997', 'D021241', 'D053545', 'D013455', 'D053719', 'D014675']","['Calibration', 'Carbon', 'Chlorella', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cyanobacteria', 'Diglycerides', 'Glycolipids', 'Ions', 'Lipids', 'Microalgae', 'Plant Leaves', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Solvents', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Spirulina', 'Sulfur', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vegetables']","Development of a targeted HPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS/MS method for the quantification of sulfolipids from a cyanobacterium, selected leafy vegetables, and a microalgae species.","[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000378']","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'methods', None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33483837,2021

33174278,"The aim of this study was to isolate monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDGs) and digalactosyldiacylglycerols (DGDGs) from perilla [Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton] and to investigate their fatty acid profiles. Perilla displayed the greatest total MGDG and DGDG content among the three types of leaf vegetables tested, that is, spinach, parsley, and perilla, containing 0.16 g/100 g MGDG and 0.04 g/100 g DGDG (on wet weight basis). High purity MGDG (approximately 97 g/100 g) and DGDG (approximately 86 g/100 g) were isolated from perilla chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) extracts by two-step silica gel column chromatography. MGDGs were primarily composed of 18:3n-3 and 16:3n-3, predominantly located at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, respectively. In DGDG, 18:3n-3 and 16:0 were the most abundant fatty acids and were primarily found at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, respectively. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: MGDGs and DGDGs are the most prevalent forms of galactoglycerolipids found in leaf vegetables including perilla and have been shown to exert health-beneficial effects, such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and appetite-suppressing activities. Both MGDGs and DGDGs possess emulsifying properties. The present study may help better understand the health-beneficial effects of MGDG and DGDG from perilla, by providing total composition and positional distribution of the fatty acids.

32892012,"Fungicides have been extensively used around the world in agriculture due to their effectiveness of sterilization. Recent evidences have shown that fungicides would exert a negative effect on gut microbiota and result in gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolism disorder on non-target organisms and even humans. However, research on residues and potential health risks of fungicides in daily consumed vegetables has received less attention compared to insecticides. In this study, we studied three widely applied fungicides, procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin, in China. We collected 551 samples of 10 different vegetables in 11 cities from Zhejiang province during 2015-2017. Three fungicides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The average apparent recoveries of three fungicides ranged from 84.2% to 110% with the relative standard deviations lower than 10%. The LOD values of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin was 2, 0.09, and 1 μg/kg, respectively. The levels of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin in those vegetables ranged from ND-875, ND-238, and ND-76 μg/kg, respectively. The highest mean concentrations of procymidone, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin were found in eggplant (68 μg/kg), spinach (16.4 μg/kg), and kidney bean (4 μg/kg), respectively. Tomato (62.6% of samples), eggplant (44.3% of samples), and cucumber (41.6% of samples) were most frequently detected with fungicides. Solanaceous fruit vegetables have the highest detection rate than other vegetables, and fungicides were most frequently detected in winter. The mean concentrations of three fungicides in different vegetables were all below the maximum residue limits for the national food safety standards of China, and the health risks resulting from consuming those vegetables in adults and children were all within the safe ranges.

No method has yet been generally accepted or validated for assessment of the allergenic potential of proteins. For development of suitable methods datasets of allergenic and nonallergenic (or low allergenic) proteins are required that can serve, respectively, as positive and negative controls. However, data are unavailable on proteins that lack or have low allergenic potential. Here, low allergenic potential proteins are identified based on the assumption that proteins with established human exposure, but with a lack of an association with allergy, possess low allergenic potential. Proteins were extracted from sources considered to have less allergenic potential (corn, potato, spinach, rice, and tomato) as well as higher allergenic potential (wheat) regarding common allergenic foods. Proteins were identified and semi-quantified by label-free proteomic analysis conducted using mass spectrometry. Predicted allergenicity was determined using AllerCatPro (https://allercatpro.bii.a-star.edu.sg/). In summary, 9077 proteins were identified and semi-quantified from 6 protein sources. Within the top 10% of the most abundant proteins identified, 178 characterized proteins were found to have no evidence for allergenicity predicted by AllerCatPro and were considered to have low allergenic potential.

Reaction time and reagent concentration for these assays were optimized using leaves from spinach, kale, collards, mustard, and watermelon. Further, these assays were validated for linearity and intra-assay precision. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC/ESI-HR-QTOFMS) was used for phytochemical profiling and studying relative abundances of certain phenolic compounds in various leaf discs suspended and cell-free extracts. The mass spectral analysis showed that leaf disc suspended methanolic extracts had almost same phytochemical profiles to those of cell-free extracts. The DPPH leaf disc assay demonstrated better radical scavenging potential than the conventional cell-free extract method. By contrast, the observed antioxidant activity values in ABTS and PPR leaf disc assays were lower than those of conventional cell-free extract-based methods. In conclusion, the developed leaf disc assays are simple and rapid for the qualitative and comparative assessment of the antioxidant potential of leaf samples, as well as can be a good alternative to conventional cell-free extract based methods.",Scientific reports,"['D000975', 'D001937', 'D002851', 'D046228', 'D010636', 'D018515', 'D021241', 'D018724']","['Antioxidants', 'Brassica', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Phenols', 'Plant Leaves', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Spinacia oleracea']",Leaf Disc Assays for Rapid Measurement of Antioxidant Activity.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30760761,2020

29134675,"The category of 'leafy vegetables' comprises a wide range of plants, including cabbage, lettuce, leeks, spinach, Swiss chard and kale, and it forms a significant component of the human diet. Typically, leafy vegetables are low in calories and fat, are great sources of vitamins, protein, dietary fibre and minerals (including iron, calcium, and nitrates), and are rich in phytochemicals. To counter the impact of pests on vegetables, a broad variety of pesticides are used. Because of their large surface areas, leafy vegetables are expected to have high residual pesticide levels. As such, a sound analytical approach is needed to detect and quantify residue levels that are equal to or lower than the maximum residue limits, thus rendering the products safe for consumption. Overall, leafy vegetables consumed raw (after a tap water wash only), boiled or steamed contribute 2% of total vegetable consumption globally, and they might have a comparatively greater influence on health than cereal ingestion. Consequently, in this review paper, we highlight the importance of leafy vegetables, the pesticides that are commonly used on them and various analytical techniques, including sample preparation, extraction, clean-up and final detection. The effects on dissipation patterns, pre-harvest residue limits and safety/risks imposed by various pesticides are also reviewed and discussed. In conclusion, environmentally friendly extraction methods coupled with high-throughput techniques with greater reproducibility and lower uncertainty are needed for quantifying residues in leafy vegetables at very low concentrations. Commercial and household food preparation, such as washing, peeling, blanching and cooking are effective in removing most of the pesticide residues that are loosely attached on vegetables.",Biomedical chromatography : BMC,"['D005591', 'D002849', 'D002851', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D010573', 'D018515', 'D018570', 'D014675']","['Chemical Fractionation', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plant Leaves', 'Risk Assessment', 'Vegetables']","Analytical approach, dissipation pattern and risk assessment of pesticide residue in green leafy vegetables: A comprehensive review.","[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'methods', 'methods', None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29134675,2018

30084609,"In this research, the surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique is used to develop a nondestructive and fast detecting method for the detection of residual chlorpyrifos on spinach. Silver colloids used for SERS spectroscopy is prepared by the reduction of silver nitrate with hydroxylamine hydrochloride at alkaline pH. The prepared silver colloids are dropped onto spinach samples, then the SERS spectra are collected non-destructively with a self-developed Raman system. This method can be made without physical contact to samples, and rapidly completed without time-consuming sample pre-treatments, and suited to the development of real-time on-line detection methods for trace pesticide residues. SERS signals are collected from 20 points on each spinach sample with 450 mW laser power and 2.5 s exposure time. Chlorpyrifos concentrations in 24 samples are determined with gas chromatography after SERS spectra taken. Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing filter and effective peak linear fitting method are used to remove the random noise and the fluorescence background for improving the accuracy of SERS results. The SERS signals are collected from different parts of 50 spinach samples with the same concentration of chlorpyrifos but at different fresh degrees. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of chlorpyrifos’ characteristic peak intensities is 13.4%. Although the differences of samples lead to differences in the curves of Raman spectrum, they have little influence on the characteristic peak intensities, which indicates the stability of the proposed detecting method. After the fluorescent background removed, the 20 curves of each sample are averaged. Correlation analysis is done between chlorpyrifos concentration and signal intensity at every Raman shift. Results show that correlation coefficients are higher than 0.85 in the range of 615.5~626.4 cm-1. Signals in this range are used to establish multiple linear regression (MLR) model for the prediction of residual chlorpyrifos. MLR model was developed for chlorpyrifos concentration versus Raman signal intensity at 615.5~626.4 cm-1 for predicting residual chlorpyrifos content in samples, the correlation coefficients of calibration (RC) and validation (RP) are 0.961 and 0.954, which indicate a good linear relationships between them. The minimum detectable threshold for this method is 0.05 mg·kg-1 which is close to the value limited by the national standard of China (0.1 mg·kg-1 for chlorpyrifos in spinach).

27548506,"There is increasing use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as pesticides for fruits and vegetables due to the particles' unique antimicrobial and insecticidal properties. However, residual AgNPs in harvested produce may transfer through the food chain and pose a potential risk to public health. The objective of this study is to determine whether postharvest washing can effectively remove AgNPs that had accumulated on fresh produce. Ten microliters of commercially available 40 nm citrate coated AgNPs (0.4 mg/L) was dropped to a (1 × 1 cm(2)) spot on spinach leaves, followed by washing with deionized water (DI water), Tsunami 100 (80 mg/L), or Clorox bleach (200 mg/L). Then, the AgNP removal efficiency of the three treatments was evaluated by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). ICP-MS results showed that deionized water removed statistically insignificant amounts of total Ag (5%), whereas Tsunami 100 and Clorox bleach yielded 21 and 10% decreases in total Ag, respectively (P < 0.05). The increased removal efficiency resulted from AgNP dissolution and Ag(+) release upon contact with the oxidizing agents in Tsunami 100 (peroxyacetic acid, hydrogen peroxide) and Clorox bleach (sodium hypochlorite). According to the SERS results, the deionized water and Tsunami 100 treatments removed nonsignificant amounts of AgNPs. Clorox bleach decreased Ag NPs by >90% (P < 0.05); however, SEM-EDS images revealed the formation of large silver chloride (AgCl) crystals (162 ± 51 nm) on the leaf, which explained the low total Ag removal from ICP-MS. This study indicates current factory washing methods for fresh produce may not be effective in reducing AgNPs (by water and Tsunami 100) and total Ag (by all three means).

This assay uses selective nicking enzyme amplification technology to amplify target genes. Samples are enriched for 12-24 h and then lysed. The assay is completed within 40 min using real-time detection in a combination incubator/fluorescence detector and software. When 44 distinct strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and 6 strains of E. coli O157:NM were tested for inclusivity, all 50 strains produced positive results. In exclusivity testing, 57 strains representing 33 species of closely related Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, including 11 non-H7 O157 strains and shiga toxin-producing E. coli other than O157:H7, were evaluated. All 57 nontarget strains generated negative ANSR assay results. Using 80% lean ground beef and beef trim (approximately 20% fat), ANSR method performance was compared to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook reference culture procedure. ANSR performance with baby spinach and sprout irrigation water was measured against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual reference method. ANSR method performance was not statistically different to that of the reference methods using two different enrichment options. For ground beef and beef trim, the standard enrichment in modified Tryptone Soya Broth can be analyzed using the ANSR assay with a 1:10 dilution of the enrichment in phosphate-buffered saline and produces equivalent results to the reference method. Additionally, in most matrixes tested (exception is spinach which required 24 h enrichment) the assay offers great efficiency and flexibility over the reference method with a 12-24 h single-step enrichment. Equivalent results were observed at both time points (12 and 24 h) to reference methods. Small changes to the assay parameters minimally affected ANSR method performance.

Uptake and elimination of the pesticides were traced in leaves, stems and roots of living malabar spinach plants. Root concentration factor (RCF), distribution concentration factor (DCF) and transpiration stream concentration factor (TSCF) were calculated based on the in vivo tracing data. The tracing data showed that the OCPs were much more accumulative and persistent than the OPPs in roots, while they were similarly accumulative and persistent in leaves and stems. RCF values of the OPPs or OCPs were likely to increase with the increase in LogKow values except fenthion. Obtained DCF values indicated that OPPs and OCPs were more accumulative in the organs containing more lipids. TSCF values showed that the translocation of OPPs and OCPs from roots to foliage was firstly dependent on the hydrophobicity of the compounds, but also significantly affected by the water solubility.

26760914,"Enzymatic extraction methods were evaluated with classical extraction approaches for the determination of arsenic in food. The extraction efficiency for total arsenic was determined by analysing CRM materials DORM-3 fish protein, NIES 106 rice flour and GBW10015 spinach. These were compared with total arsenic concentration determined using microwave-assisted acid digestion and ICP-MS. The total arsenic concentrations in the CRM materials were in good agreement with the certified values. Enzymatic hydrolysis using trypsin has been successfully employed to extract arsenic species in DORM-3 and fish samples. Whilst this method of hydrolysing the proteins worked well for the fish samples, an alternative approach was required to facilitate the digestion of cellulose in plant materials. However, enzymatic extraction using cellulase was found to give unsatisfactory results for both the NIES and GBW10015 CRM materials. Dilute nitric acid (1% HNO3) was found to give a more efficient extraction for arsenic species in the same CRM materials and rice samples. The study was extended to evaluate a range of real samples. Total arsenic concentrations in 13 different types of fish tissue were determined following microwave-assisted acid digestion using nitric acid/hydrogen peroxide, followed by measurement using HPLC-ICP-MS for speciation analysis. The results obtained for fish were in the range of 3.53-98.80 µg g(-1) As (dry weight). Similarly, the results of 17 rice samples were in the range of 0.054-0.823 µg g(-1).

26516829,"In the North of Brazil (Pará and Amazonas states) the leaves of the plant Talinum triangulare (popular: cariru) replace spinach as food. From a phytochemical point of view, they are rich in compounds of the group of pheophytins. These substances, related to chlorophyll, have photophysical properties that give them potential application in photodynamic therapy. Human serum albumin (HSA) is one of the main endogenous vehicles for biodistribution of molecules by blood plasma. Association constants and thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of HSA with pheophytin from Talinum triangulare were studied by UV-Vis absorption, fluorescence techniques, and molecular modeling (docking). Fluorescence quenching of the HSA's internal fluorophore (tryptophan) at temperatures 296 K, 303 K, and 310 K, resulted in values for the association constants of the order of 10⁴ L∙mol(-1), indicating a moderate interaction between the compound and the albumin. The negative values of ΔG° indicate a spontaneous process; ΔH° = 15.5 kJ∙mol(-1) indicates an endothermic process of association and ΔS° = 0.145 kJ∙mol(-1)∙K(-1) shows that the interaction between HSA and pheophytin occurs mainly by hydrophobic factors. The observed Trp fluorescence quenching is static: there is initial non-fluorescent association, in the ground state, HSA:Pheophytin. Possible solution obtained by a molecular docking study suggests that pheophytin is able to interact with HSA by means of hydrogen bonds with three lysine and one arginine residues, whereas the phytyl group is inserted in a hydrophobic pocket, close to Trp-214.

The sample was cut into pieces and placed into a mixer cup containing half weight amount of 10% phosphoric acid in order to suppress degradation of easily degraded pesticides, represented by captan, and then homogenized. Pesticides in the phosphoric acid-treated sample were extracted with acetonitrile using a homogenizer, followed by salting out with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride. The extract was cleaned up on a C18 and graphite carbon black/PSA mini-cartridge column. Some pesticides gave tailing peaks, but these peaks became sharp and symmetrical when polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 was added to the test solution. Recovery tests were performed on nine kinds of agricultural products (brown rice, soybean, spinach, cabbage, potato, orange, apple, strawberry, and Japanese pear) fortified with 170 pesticides at 0.01 and 0.1 μg/g. Each concentration of pesticide residue was extracted from 2 samples on 5 separate days.

The current method modification includes the optional immunomagnetic separation (IMS) to enrich the bacteria as well as optional visual fluorescence readout without the use of a turbidimeter. The following study was conducted to validate the proposed modifications against the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Food Safety and Inspection Service Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook (MLG) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) reference methods. E. coli O157:H7 ATCC 35150 and NM (non-motile) 700377 strains were used to inoculate the ground beef, beef trim, and spinach to obtain 20 low (0.23-2 CFU/test portion) and five high levels (3-5 CFU/test portion) of inoculations. Enriched samples were tested directly and subjected to anti-E. coli IMS prior to the SAS Molecular Tests. Results were determined via visual fluorescence and via turbidity using a turbidimeter. All the replicates, irrespective of the results, were confirmed using MLG 5.05 or BAM Chapter 4A methods. Results indicated that there were no significant differences in the detection of fractional positives (5-15 positives out of 20 replicates) with any of the methods tested above as compared to the reference methods. No false positives or negatives were detected except for two in the ground beef with IMS+Turbidity method. No false-negative samples were detected. Statistical analysis indicated that the modified methods were equivalent to the reference methods in detecting E. coli O157:H7 in the food matrixes tested. SAS Molecular Tests E. coli O157 Detection Kit can be used to detect E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef, beef trim, and spinach. The inclusion of IMS in the modified method improved the detection rate of E. coli O157:H7 in spinach and showed comparable detection rate in ground beef and beef trim.

Foliar lead uptake was demonstrated for vegetables exposed to airborne PM. Our main objective here was to highlight the health risk associated with the consumption of vegetables exposed to foliar deposits of PM enriched with the various metal(loid)s frequently observed in the atmosphere of urban areas (Cd, Sb, Zn and Pb). Leaves of mature cabbage and spinach were exposed to manufactured mono-metallic oxide particles (CdO, Sb2O3 and ZnO) or to complex process PM mainly enriched with lead. Total and bioaccessible metal(loid) concentrations were then measured for polluted vegetables and the various PM used as sources. Finally, scanning electronic microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis was used to study PM-phyllosphere interactions. High quantities of Cd, Sb, Zn and Pb were taken up by the plant leaves. These levels depended on both the plant species and nature of the PM, highlighting the interest of acquiring data for different plants and sources of exposure in order to better identify and manage health risks. A maximum of 2% of the leaf surfaces were covered with the PM. However, particles appeared to be enriched in stomatal openings, with up to 12% of their area occupied.

24592995,"The ability of foods and beverages to reduce allyl methyl disulfide, diallyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, and allyl methyl sulfide on human breath after consumption of raw garlic was examined. The treatments were consumed immediately following raw garlic consumption for breath measurements, or were blended with garlic prior to headspace measurements. Measurements were done using a selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometer. Chlorophyllin treatment demonstrated no deodorization in comparison to the control. Successful treatments may be due to enzymatic, polyphenolic, or acid deodorization. Enzymatic deodorization involved oxidation of polyphenolic compounds by enzymes, with the oxidized polyphenols causing deodorization. This was the probable mechanism in raw apple, parsley, spinach, and mint treatments. Polyphenolic deodorization involved deodorization by polyphenolic compounds without enzymatic activity. This probably occurred for microwaved apple, green tea, and lemon juice treatments. When pH is below 3.6, the enzyme alliinase is inactivated, which causes a reduction in volatile formation. This was demonstrated in pH-adjusted headspace measurements. However, the mechanism for volatile reduction on human breath (after volatile formation) is unclear, and may have occurred in soft drink and lemon juice breath treatments. Whey protein was not an effective garlic breath deodorant and had no enzymatic activity, polyphenolic compounds, or acidity. Headspace concentrations did not correlate well to breath treatments.

Vegetables were sampled from August to October 2010. After washing, they were oven-dried and digested using three-acid mixture (70% HNO3, 65% HClO4 and 70% H2SO4). Analyzes of the heavy metals was performed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. To validate the assay method, intra-day and inter-day variation studies were performed. The concentrations (μg/g) of heavy metals in the samples ranged from 0.00 to 3.66 for Cd, 0.00 to 6.00 for Cr and 0.00 to 7.14 for Pb. The highest concentration of heavy metals was for Pb. The results showed that the amount of Cd, Cr and Pb of some samples exceeded the recommended levels. The amount of Cd in cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes with skin, carrots, and spinach was significantly higher in the samples collected from Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms than those of Dorche farms. Also, the amount of Cr in onion, carrots, and spinach was significantly higher in samples collected from Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms than those of Dorche farms. However, the amount of Pb in the carrots and leek was significantly higher in the samples collected from Dorche farms than those of Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms.

Co-extractives were removed by use of our original triple layered column (C18/GC/PSA; 60/30/60 mg). According to the method validation guideline of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, we conducted recovery tests in 5 kinds of agricultural products (brown rice, kiwi, cabbage, sweet potato and spinach) spiked with 60 pesticides at the level of 0.01 or 0.1 μg/g. Each concentration of pesticide spiked was extracted from 2 samples per day on 5 days. Pesticides in the test solution were determined by two types of LC-MS/MS using scheduled MRM.

25743385,"A validation study was performed on a multiresidue method for determination of pesticide residues in agricultural products according to the method validation guideline of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. FASRAC (Food Automatic Analytical Systems for Residual Agricultural Chemicals) automatically performs extraction of pesticide residues from agricultural products with acetonitrile, filtration, constant volume, mixing with the use of air, mixing acetonitrile with buffer solvent, separation, and dehydration with sodium sulfate. The extract was purified with a GC/NH2 column. For wheat flour and soybeans, a purification step with a C18 column was added before a GC/NH2 column. After removal of the solvent, the extract was resolved in n-hexane/acetone solvent for GC-MS/MS analysis. In the case of manual analysis, pesticide residues were analyzed according to official multiresidue methods and purification steps were the same as in FASRAC. Recovery tests were performed with wheat flour, soybeans, spinach and apples, by addition of 302 pesticides at the concentrations 0.01 mg/kg. The results indicate that automatic extraction using FASRAC is superior to manual analysis in trueness, repeatability and within-run reproducibility.

24161146,"In multiresidue analysis, as the complexity of matrix increases, matrix co-extractives might co-elute and interfere with the detection of target analytes, and thereby result in false positives and erroneous quantifications. This paper aims to evaluate the combination of enhanced mass resolution and concurrent selectivity and sensitivity in analyzing a complex mixture of 341 pesticides in grape, orange, tomato, okra and spinach by gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Timed-selective reaction monitoring (t-SRM) was found advantageous over segment SRM in terms of ease of method optimization and sensitivity. The optimized t-SRM method was used to test the applicability of ultra-SRM (USRM) in filtering out co-eluting interfering matrix compounds. False detections of benfluralin, dimethoate, etc. could be avoided when mass resolution was increased from 0.7 to 0.4 and 0.2Da (full width at half maximum). Similar observations were noted for chlorobenzilate, spiromesifen, tebuconazole, etc., in grape; omethoate, bendiocarb, monocrotophos, etc. in orange; omethoate, dimethoate, ethoxyquin, atrazine, etc., in tomato; and dichlobenil, omethoate, propoxur, monocrotophos, etc., in okra. The analysis at higher mass resolution could significantly minimize matrix effects (ME), e.g., 34% at 0.7Da for spiroxamine in grape to 0.6% (0.4Da) and -44% (0.7Da) for dichlorvos in okra to 8.8% (0.1Da). A feature called ""quantitation enhanced data-dependent (QED) scan feature"" was found effective in targeted screening to confirm the detection of atrazine, azoxystrobin, λ-cyhalothrin, etc. at trace quantities in incurred samples and avoid false detection of chlorpyrifos.

In this study, a high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometer with multiple reaction monitoring was used to simultaneously determine thiophanate-methyl and its metabolite carbendazim, metalaxyl, and fluazifop-P-butyl in various samples; gas chromatography with an electron capture detector was used to detect chlorpyrifos and λ-cyhalothrin. The limits of quantitation (LOQs) of these six pesticides were in the range of 0.001-0.01 mg kg(-1) for all samples, and the average recoveries of all pesticides ranged from 60.1 to 119.1% at 0.01 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) spiked levels. The relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged from 1.1 to 13.9%. All maximal concentrations of the six pesticides in six leaf vegetables in autumn were higher than in summer in Beijing. For most pesticides half-lives in autumn were longer than in summer.

23791666,"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a photoautotrophic green alga, which can be grown mixotrophically in acetate-supplemented media (Tris-acetate-phosphate). We show that acetate has a direct effect on photosystem II (PSII). As a consequence, Tris-acetate-phosphate-grown mixotrophic C. reinhardtii cultures are less susceptible to photoinhibition than photoautotrophic cultures when subjected to high light. Spin-trapping electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that thylakoids from mixotrophic C. reinhardtii produced less (1)O2 than those from photoautotrophic cultures. The same was observed in vivo by measuring DanePy oxalate fluorescence quenching. Photoinhibition can be induced by the production of (1)O2 originating from charge recombination events in photosystem II, which are governed by the midpoint potentials (Em) of the quinone electron acceptors. Thermoluminescence indicated that the Em of the primary quinone acceptor (QA/QA(-)) of mixotrophic cells was stabilised while the Em of the secondary quinone acceptor (QB/QB(-)) was destabilised, therefore favouring direct non-radiative charge recombination events that do not lead to (1)O2 production. Acetate treatment of photosystem II-enriched membrane fragments from spinach led to the same thermoluminescence shifts as observed in C. reinhardtii, showing that acetate exhibits a direct effect on photosystem II independent from the metabolic state of a cell. A change in the environment of the non-heme iron of acetate-treated photosystem II particles was detected by low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. We hypothesise that acetate replaces the bicarbonate associated to the non-heme iron and changes the environment of QA and QB affecting photosystem II charge recombination events and photoinhibition.

The manual recommends the use of two elements (Tl and Bi) as internal standards for measurement of uranium by ICP-MS. We found that Tl was more suitable than Bi to quantify trace amounts of uranium in spinach. However, it was necessary to determine Tl or Bi concentrations in the sample before analysis, since some samples of spinach contained significant amounts of these elements.

23206394,"A method for the rapid simultaneous screening and identification of multiple pesticide residues in vegetables was established using a novel database and gas chromatography in combination with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOF MS). A total of 187 pesticides with different chemical species were measured by GC-QTOF MS to create the database, which collected the retention time and exact masses of ions from the first-stage mass spectrum (MS(1) spectrum) and second-stage mass spectrum (MS(2) spectrum) for each pesticide. The workflow of the created database consisted of ""MS(1) screening"" for possible pesticides by chemical formula match and ""MS(2) identification"" for structural confirmation of product ion by accurate mass measurement. To evaluate the applicability of the database, a spinach matrix was prepared by solid phase extraction, spiked with a mixture of 50 pesticides at seven concentrations between 0.1 and 10ppb, and analyzed by GC-QTOF MS. It was found that all of the 50 pesticides with concentrations as low as 5ppb were detected in the ""MS(1) screening"" step and accurate masses were identified with errors less than 2.5mDa in the ""MS(2) identification"" step, indicating high sensitivity, accuracy, selectivity and specificity. Finally, to validate the applicability, the new method was applied to four fresh celery, rape, scallion and spinach vegetables from a local market. As a result, a total of 13 pesticides were found, with 11 in celery, 9 in rape, 3 in scallion and 2 in spinach.

23182936,"Gas and liquid chromatography (GC and LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) serve as the most powerful analytical tools commonly used to monitor pesticide residues in food, among other applications. However, both GC-MS and LC-MS are susceptible to matrix effects which can adversely affect quantification depending on the analyte, matrix, sample preparation, instrumentation, and operating conditions. Among the approaches that reduce matrix effects, the most common in pesticide residue applications is matrix-matched calibration because it is relatively inexpensive and simple. Also, it has been shown to work well during method validation when fortified samples are exactly matched with samples used for calibration. However, the quality of matrix-matched results in real-world analyses depends on the consistency of matrix effects among diverse samples. In this study, the variability of matrix effects was measured for 38 representative pesticides in 20 samples each (including different varieties) of rice, orange, apple, and spinach extracted using the ""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe"" (QuEChERS) method for analysis by LC-MS/MS and low-pressure GC-MS. Using LC-MS/MS, only oranges gave >20% matrix effects for a few pesticides. GC-MS exhibited larger matrix effects, but as in LC-MS/MS, the differences were reasonably consistent among the 20 samples tested. Main conclusions of this study are that for the conditions utilized: (1) matrix-matching was not needed for most pesticides in the simpler food matrices; and (2) for the more complex orange matrix, acceptably accurate quantitative results were achieved by using matrix-matching even with a different sample of the same type. However, full confidence cannot be extended to matrix-matched results, and for consequential applications such as regulatory enforcement, confirmatory analyses using alternate quantitative determinations should also be conducted.",Journal of chromatography.

Although a rich natural source are vegetables, the literature lacks data on the effect of the pre-treatment and freezing technologies used in vegetable processing and frozen storage time on the folate content in these materials. Moreover, since folates are very unstable nutrients, the amount available in processed and stored foods can be significantly lower than in raw products. In tested vegetables (green beans, yellow beans, peas, cauliflower, broccoli and spinach), one folate form was identified, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH₃-H₄folate). It was observed that pre-treatment and freezing technology significantly (p < 0.05) decreased 5-CH₃-H₄folate content only in vegetables with the largest degree of fragmentation (cut and briquetted spinach) and the smallest size (peas). In all analyzed samples, the 5-CH₃-H₄folate content decreased with the time of frozen storage.

In this work, a new procedure based on a sequential extraction and analysis of both types of vitamins is presented. The procedure couples several simple extraction steps to LC-MS/MS and LC-DAD in order to quantify the free vitamins contents in fresh-cut vegetables before and after a 10-days storage period. The developed method allows the correct quantification of vitamins C, B(1), B(2), B(3), B(5), B(6), B(9), E and provitamin A in ready-to-eat green leafy vegetable products including green lettuce, ruby red lettuce, watercress, swiss chard, lamb's lettuce, spearmint, spinach, wild rocket, pea leaves, mizuna, garden cress and red mustard. Using this optimized methodology, low LOQs were attained for the analyzed vitamins in less than 100 min, including extraction and vitamin analysis using 2 optimized procedures; good repeatability and linearity was achieved for all vitamins studied, while recoveries ranged from 83% to 105%. The most abundant free vitamins found in leafy vegetable products were vitamin C, provitamin A and vitamin E. The richest sample on vitamin C and provitamin A was pea leaves (154 mg/g fresh weight and 14.4 mg/100g fresh weight, respectively), whereas lamb's lettuce was the vegetable with the highest content on vitamin E (3.1 mg/100 g fresh weight).

These pesticides were commonly used as broad-spectrum insecticides in pest control and high-residual levels had been detected in vegetables. Our research showed that the electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water (pH 2.3, available chlorine concentration:70 ppm, oxidation-reduction potential [ORP]: 1170 mV) and the electrolyzed reducing (ER) water (pH 11.6, ORP: -860 mV) can reduce the pesticide residues effectively. Pesticide residues on fresh spinach after 30 min of immersion in electrolyzed water reduced acephate by 74% (EO) and 86% (ER), omethoate by 62% (EO) and 75% (ER), DDVP by 59% (EO) and 46% (ER), respectively. The efficacy of using EO water or ER water was found to be better than that of using tap water or detergent (both were reduced by more than 25%). Besides spinach, the cabbage and leek polluted by DDVP were also investigated and the degradation efficacies were similar to the spinach.

This is the first survey of Campylobacter in a free-ranging feral swine population in the United States. Campylobacter species were cultured from buccal and rectal-anal swabs, colonic faeces and tonsils using a combination of selective enrichment and antibiotic-free membrane filtration methods. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS, Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) was used to identify species followed by confirmatory multiplex PCR or 16S rRNA sequencing. Genetic relatedness of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains was determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and porA allele sequencing. Altogether, 12 (40%) of 30 feral swine gastrointestinal and oral cavity specimens were positive, and six species were isolated: Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter fetus, Campylobacter hyointestinalsis, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter lanienae and Campylobacter sputorum. Campylobacter jejuni subtypes were closely related to MLST sequence type 21 (ST-21) and had identical porA sequences. Campylobacter coli subtypes were unrelated to isolates in the pubMLST/porA database. This feral swine population lived in close association with a 'grassfed' beef cattle herd adjacent to spinach and other leafy green row crop fields.

22004472,"Breeding to increase folate levels in edible parts of plants, termed folate biofortification, is an economical approach to fight against folate deficiency in humans, especially in the developing world. Germplasm with elevated folates are a useful genetic source for both breeding and direct use. Spinach is one of the well-know vegetables that contains a relatively high amount of folate. Currently, little is known about how much folate, and their composition varies in different spinach accessions. The aim of this study was to investigate natural variation in the folate content and composition of spinach genotypes grown under controlled environmental conditions. The folate content and composition in 67 spinach accessions were collected from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC) germplasm collections according to their origin, grown under control conditions to screen for natural diversity. Folates were extracted by a monoenzyme treatment and analyzed by a validated liquid chromatography (LC) method. The total folate content ranged from 54.1 to 173.2 μg/100 g of fresh weight, with 3.2-fold variation, and was accession-dependent. Four spinach accessions (PI 499372, NSL 6095, PI 261787, and TOT7337-B) have been identified as enriched folate content over 150 μg/100 g of fresh weight. The folate forms found were H(4)-folate, 5-CH(3)-H(4)-folate, and 5-HCO-H(4)-folate, and 10-CHO-folic acid also varied among different accessions and was responsible for variation in the total folate content. The major folate vitamer was represented by 5-CH(3)-H(4)-folate, which on average accounted for up to 52% of the total folate pool.

21850305,"We have studied the binding of the toxic element Cd to plant proteins and have used for this purpose spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) plants treated with 50 μM Cd(II) as a model system. Laser ablation ICP-MS has been applied for the screening of Cd-binding proteins after separation by native anodal polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AN-PAGE) and electroblotting onto membranes. The main Cd-carrying protein band was isolated and investigated by nano-electrospray ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry after tryptic digestion. By this procedure, the main Cd-binding protein was identified as ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). The latter enzyme has been discussed in the literature to be affected in its activity by oxidative stress induced by Cd. However, in this paper it is demonstrated for the first time that RuBisCO directly binds Cd and thus may be directly altered by this toxic element. A commercially available protein standard was used to verify direct binding of Cd(II) to the protein, even without metabolisation. The resulting metal-protein complex was shown to be stable enough to survive AN-PAGE separation and electroblotting. By the use of size exclusion chromatography coupled with ICP-MS it was demonstrated that the RuBisCO protein standard shows similar metal binding properties to Cd. Furthermore, essential elements such as Mn(II), Fe(II) and Cu(II), which are known to possibly replace the RuBisCO activator Mg(II), were investigated in addition to Zn(II).

Each of the targeted pesticides was readily detected with both high-resolution and full-scan collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra. In the case of simazine and sevin, a mass resolution of 100,000 was insufficient to distinguish the isobaric protonated molecules for these compounds. When the surface of a spinach leaf was analyzed by LESA, trace levels of diazinon were readily detected on the spinach purchased directly from a supermarket before they were sprayed with the five-pesticide mixture. A 30 s rinse under hot running tap water appeared to quantitatively remove all remaining residues of this pesticide. Diazinon was readily detected by LESA analysis on the skin of the artificially sprayed spinach. Finally, incurred pyrimethanil at a level of 169 ppb in a batch slurry of homogenized apples was analyzed by LESA and this pesticide was readily detected by both high-resolution mass spectrometry and full-scan CID mass spectrometry, thus showing that pesticides may also be detected in whole fruit homogenized samples.

The extraction is carried out with 75:25 (v/v) tetrahydrofuran:water, a solvent mixture that provides an appropriate balance of hydrogen bonding, dispersion and dipole-dipole interactions to efficiently extract PFCs with chains containing 4-14 carbon atoms from foods. This mixture provided recoveries above 85% from foods including vegetables, fruits, fish, meat and bread; and above 75% from cheese. Clean-up with a weak anion exchange resin and Envi-carb SPE, which were coupled in line for simplicity, was found to minimize matrix effects (viz. enhancement or suppression of electrospray ionization). The target analytes (PFCs) were resolved on a perfluorooctyl phase column that proved effective in separating mass interferences for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in fish and meat samples. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative electrospray ionization mode and used to record two transitions per analyte and one per mass-labeled method internal standard. The target PFCs were quantified from solvent based calibration curves. The limits of detection (LODs) were as low as 1-5 pg analyte g(-1) food; by exception, those for C(4) and C(5) PFCs were somewhat higher (25-30 pg g(-1)) owing to their less favourable mass response. To the best of our knowledge these are among the best LODs for PFCs in foods reported to date. The analysis of a variety of foods revealed contamination with PFCs at levels from 4.5 to 75 pg g(-1) in 25% of samples (fish and packaged spinach).

20641006,"The potential applications of a new atmospheric pressure source for GC-MS analysis have been investigated in this work. A list of around 100 GC-amenable pesticides, which includes organochlorine, organophosphorus and organonitrogenated compounds, has been used to evaluate their behavior in the new source. Favoring the major formation of the molecular ion in the source has been the main goal due to the wide-scope screening possibilities that this fact brings in comparison with the traditional, highly fragmented electron ionization spectra. Thus, the addition of water as modifier has been tested as a way to promote the generation of protonated molecules. Pesticides investigated have been classified into six groups according to their ionization/fragmentation behavior. Four of them are characterized by the abundant formation of the protonated molecule in the atmospheric pressure source, mostly being the base peak of the spectrum. These results show that wide-scope screening could be easily performed with this source by investigating the presence of the protonated molecule ion, MH+. The developed procedure has been applied to pesticide screening in different food samples (nectarine, orange and spinach) and it has allowed the presence of several pesticides to be confirmed such as chlorpyriphos ethyl, deltamethrin and endosulfan sulfate. The availability of a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument made it feasible to perform additional MS/MS experiments for both standards and samples to go further in the confirmation of the identity of the detected compounds.

20237919,"A multi-residue method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of around 130 multiclass pesticides in orange, nectarine and spinach samples by GC-MS/MS with a triple quadrupole analyzer. Compounds have been selected from different chemical families including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and acaricides. Three isotopically labeled standards have been used as surrogates in order to improve accurate quantitation. Samples were extracted by using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) with ethyl acetate. In the case of spinach, an additional clean-up step by gel permeation chromatography was applied. Determination was performed by GC-MS/MS in electron ionization mode acquiring two MS/MS transitions for each analyte. The intensity ratio between quantitation transition (Q) and identification transition (q) was used as confirmatory parameter (Q/q ratio). Accuracy and precision were evaluated by means of recovery experiments in orange, nectarine, and spinach samples spiked at two concentration levels (0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg). Recoveries were, in most cases, between 70% and 120% and RSD were below 20%. The limits of quantification objective for which the method was satisfactorily validated in the three samples matrices were for most pesticides 0.01 mg/kg. Matrix effects over the GC-MS/MS determination were tested by comparison of reference standards in pure solvent with matrix-matched standards of each matrix. Data obtained showed enhancement of signal for the majority of analytes in the three matrices investigated. Consequently, in order to reduce the systematic error due to this effect, quantification was performed using matrix-matched standard calibration curves.

Method validation results showed that all but 1 of these 191 pesticides can be analyzed by LC-MS/MS with instrument detection limits (IDL) in the parts per trillion (ppt) range. Matrix-dependent IDL studies showed that due to either the low ionization efficiency or matrix effect exerted, 14 of these 191 pesticides could not be analyzed by this method.

The potential of small peptides derived from precursor food proteins, to bind to partly unfolded stressed proteins to prevent their irreversible aggregation and inactivation has been demonstrated in various in vitro test systems: dithiothreitol-induced aggregation of alpha-lactalbumin (LA), heat-induced aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and aggregation and inactivation of bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the process of its refolding after removal of stress conditions. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), turbidimetry, fluorescence, and circular dichroism measurements protective effects of the synthetic opioid peptides: exorphin C from wheat gluten (Tyr-Pro-Ile-Ser-Leu), rubiscolin-5 from spinach ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Asp-Leu), and hemorphin-6 from bovine hemoglobin (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg) have been revealed.

However, no data are available on the impact of food ingredients on the retention or release of furan from food. These data are important, since they explain the differences in furan removal during domestic food preparation. Furan retention was studied by spiking various samples with D(4)-furan and comparing D(4)-furan evaporation from these samples with comparable aqueous solutions. In addition, furan concentrations were determined. Furan retention caused by starch gels was negligible. Oils caused high furan retention: peak areas of furan in oils ranged from 22 to 25% of the corresponding aqueous solutions. In addition, in coffee, furan retention was mainly caused by the lipophilic fraction. However, since furan retention was also found in defatted coffee and coffee grounds, other coffee constituents also have the ability to retain furan. Peak areas of furan in the headspace of baby foods ranged from 71 to 97% of those in water. In addition, in this case, the highest retention was found in baby foods with added oils.

MS/MS analysis showed that the main flavonoids are not modified during storage in intact leaves, while some of them increased significantly during storage in the fresh-cut samples. Fresh-cut spinach did not show color alteration even if PPO activity increased significantly during storage. This finding was related to the high ascorbic acid content, which delays the subsequent polymerization events.

Speciation and bioavailability are critical for accurate human health risk assessment, as As species vary in both their toxicity and bioavailability. Recent incidences of As poisoning in many countries have led to significant research into the fate and dynamics of As in the soil and water environment, including speciation. Although one of the major pathways of ingestion of As is via food, only limited research has been conducted to assess the nature and proportion of various As species present in food crops. In this study, we compared the efficacy of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and protein extracting solution for the extractability of As from two different species of spinach (amaranth and silverbeet). We found that a microwave-assisted technique with protein extracting solution was most effective, yielding 76-114% extractability and excellent separation and speciation of all As species present in the spinach matrices. The stability test for extracted As species showed them as stable for 45 days without any significant loss or inter-conversion. Both As(III) and As(V) were identified in the shoots of amaranth and silverbeet. However, the percentage of As species varied between amaranth and silverbeet. The silverbeet shoot showed a somewhat higher percentage of As(V), while the amaranth showed a higher percentage of As(III).

It was based on solid phase extraction of copper(II) ions on a minicolumn of Amberlite XAD-2 loaded with 2-(2-thiazolylazo)-5-dimethylaminophenol (TAM). The optimisation process was carried out using Doehlert designs. Four variables (sampling flow rate, SR; elution flow rate, buffer concentration, BC; and pH) were regarded as factors in the optimisation. The parameter ""sensitivity efficiency (SE)"" proposed in this paper, and defined as the analytical signal obtained for an on-line enrichment system for a preconcentration time of 1 min was used as analytical response in the optimisation process. Using the established experimental conditions, the proposed on-line system allowed determination of copper with detection limit (3sigma/S) of 0.23 mug l(-1), and a precision (repeatability), calculated as relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 3.9 and 3.7% for copper concentration of 5.00 and 20.00 mug l(-1), respectively.

Evidence is mainly against all-E-beta-carotene, while there is no evidence against other carotenoids or against mixtures of beta-carotene stereoisomers. Carotenoid isomers could account for the variability in study results but are rarely estimated, and reference to the degree of their consumption is lacking. The aim of our study was to create a comprehensive database of carotenoid isomers content in food items commonly consumed in Israel. Food items were analyzed using a liquid chromatography system to determine the content of carotenoid isomers in Israeli food. The main sources of carotenoids detected in Israeli foods were tomato juice, tomato, watermelon, parsley, coriander, spinach, carrot, sweet potato, banana, zucchini, mango, loquat, pepper, eggplant, and chickpeas. Data were used to measure consumption in healthy participants of a case-control study, using a semi-quantitative food-frequency 187-item questionnaire. Compared to reference studies, the median carotenoid isomers intake in 712 Israeli healthy controls (age range 23-95 years, mean 71 +/- 10.9 years, median 73 years) was higher for beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin, while the intake of lycopene was lower. Major differences in consumption were noticed between ethnic groups consuming Mediterranean diets and those consuming Western-type diets. Population consumption patterns of carotenoid isomers using a comprehensive database are used to improve our understanding in disease prevention.

18463094,"The Arabidopsis thaliana VTC2 gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of GDP-L-galactose to L-galactose 1-phosphate in the first committed step of the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway to plant vitamin C synthesis. Mutations in VTC2 had previously been found to lead to only partial vitamin C deficiency. Here we show that the Arabidopsis gene At5g55120 encodes an enzyme with high sequence identity to VTC2. Designated VTC5, this enzyme displays substrate specificity and enzymatic properties that are remarkably similar to those of VTC2, suggesting that it may be responsible for residual vitamin C synthesis in vtc2 mutants. The exact nature of the reaction catalyzed by VTC2/VTC5 is controversial because of reports that kiwifruit and Arabidopsis VTC2 utilize hexose 1-phosphates as phosphorolytic acceptor substrates. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy and a VTC2-H238N mutant, we provide evidence that the reaction proceeds through a covalent guanylylated histidine residue within the histidine triad motif. Moreover, we show that both the Arabidopsis VTC2 and VTC5 enzymes catalyze simple phosphorolysis of the guanylylated enzyme, forming GDP and L-galactose 1-phosphate from GDP-L-galactose and phosphate, with poor reactivity of hexose 1-phosphates as phosphorolytic acceptors. Indeed, the endogenous activities from Japanese mustard spinach, lemon, and spinach have the same substrate requirements. These results show that Arabidopsis VTC2 and VTC5 proteins and their homologs in other plants are enzymes that guanylylate a conserved active site His residue with GDP-L-galactose, forming L-galactose 1-phosphate for vitamin C synthesis, and regenerate the enzyme with phosphate to form GDP.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D029042', 'D020816', 'D017360', 'D029681', 'D001205', 'D005695', 'D006153', 'D006156', 'D009154', 'D009713', 'D010744', 'D013379']","['Actinidia', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Galactosephosphates', 'Guanosine Diphosphate', 'Guanosine Diphosphate Sugars', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotidyltransferases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Substrate Specificity']",A second GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase in arabidopsis en route to vitamin C.

18355436,"The fluorescence decay kinetics of Photosystem II (PSII) membranes from spinach with open reaction centers (RCs), were compared after exciting at 420 and 484 nm. These wavelengths lead to preferential excitation of chlorophyll (Chl) a and Chl b, respectively, which causes different initial excited-state populations in the inner and outer antenna system. The non-exponential fluorescence decay appears to be 4.3+/-1.8 ps slower upon 484 nm excitation for preparations that contain on average 2.45 LHCII (light-harvesting complex II) trimers per reaction center. Using a recently introduced coarse-grained model it can be concluded that the average migration time of an electronic excitation towards the RC contributes approximately 23% to the overall average trapping time. The migration time appears to be approximately two times faster than expected based on previous ultrafast transient absorption and fluorescence measurements. It is concluded that excitation energy transfer in PSII follows specific energy transfer pathways that require an optimized organization of the antenna complexes with respect to each other. Within the context of the coarse-grained model it can be calculated that the rate of primary charge separation of the RC is (5.5+/-0.4 ps)(-1), the rate of secondary charge separation is (137+/-5 ps)(-1) and the drop in free energy upon primary charge separation is 826+/-30 cm(-1).

The small column capacity required for directly coupling with electrospray MS/MS was accomplished by forming a rectangular spiral groove on a plastic disk and sealing it with a PTFE sheet. This novel dual CCC-MS/MS technique was successfully applied for the rapid determination of methomyl, fenobucarb and carbaryl pesticides in food. A two-phase solvent system of n-hexane-acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid (45:45:10) was suitable for both good dual CCC separation and sufficient ionization of pesticides.

However, the current Adequate Intakes (AI) might not be sufficient for the maintenance of bone health. To obtain a closer estimate of dietary intake of phylloquinone (PK) and menaquinones (MKs), PK, MK-4 and MK-7 contents in food samples (58 food items) were determined by an improved high-performance liquid chromatography method. Next, we assessed dietary vitamin K intake in young women living in eastern Japan using vitamin K contents measured here and the Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan. PK was widely distributed in green vegetables and algae, and high amounts were found in spinach and broccoli (raw, 498 and 307 microg/100 g wet weight, respectively). Although MK-4 was widely distributed in animal products, overall MK-4 content was lower than PK. MK-7 was observed characteristically in fermented soybean products such as natto (939 microg/100 g). The mean total vitamin K intake of all subjects (using data from this study and Japanese food composition tables) was about 230 microg/d and 94% of participants met the AI of vitamin K for women aged 18-29 y in Japan, 60 microg/d.

The presented method combines spectrum quality scoring, de novo sequencing and error tolerant BLAST searches and is designed to decrease input data complexity. Spectral quality scoring reduces the number of investigated mass spectra without a loss of information. Stringent quality-based selection and the combination of different de novo sequencing methods substantially increase the catalog of significant peptide alignments. The de novo sequences passing a reliability filter are subsequently submitted to error tolerant BLAST searches and MS-BLAST hits are validated by a sampling technique. With the described workflow, we identified up to 20% more groups of homologous proteins in proteome analyses with organisms whose genome is not sequenced than by state-of-the-art database searches in an Arabidopsis thaliana database.

Most people prefer introduced foods to traditional foods, including plant foods whose consumption is widely regarded as a primitive culture manifesting poor lifestyles. However, recent studies on traditional plant foods have shown that some are highly nutritious; containing high levels of both vitamins and minerals. They also have potential as a remedy to counter food insecurity since most are well adapted to the local environment, enabling them to resist pests, drought and diseases. This paper describes the mineral (calcium, iron and zinc) contents in some 54 traditional vegetable species collected from Nyang'oma area of Bondo district, western Kenya. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the mineral content. We found that most traditional leafy vegetables, domesticated and wild, generally contain higher levels of calcium, iron and zinc compared with the introduced varieties such as spinach (Spanacia oleracea), kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata).

17721903,"It is of increasing interest and practical importance to develop convenient methods based on mass spectrometry for high-throughput analyses of biological samples. This is usually difficult because of the complex matrix and ion suppression effects. Generation of ions at ambient conditions is a promising solution to these problems because the sample is easily accessible and the ion suppression effect is reduced significantly. A new method for rapid on-line detection of metabolic markers in complex biological samples is described here. It combines atmospheric pressure desorption sampling by a gentle stream of air or nitrogen with extractive electrospray ionization (EESI) and mass spectrometric analysis. The resulting mass spectral fingerprints are shown to be able to detect spoilage of meat even in the frozen (-20 degrees C) state and the contamination of spinach by E. coli, and to identify metabolites and contaminants on human skin within seconds, in an on-line and high-throughput fashion. Typical molecular markers are identified using MS/MS data and by comparison with reference compounds. Differences between closely related samples are easily visualized by using principal component analysis (PCA) of the mass spectra data. The detection limit achieved is 10 fg/cm2 (S/N = 3) for histamine on the surface of frozen meat.

Comparison of results to previous studies revealed that blood lead, blood mercury, serum nickel, serum selenium and urine molybdenum levels were generally higher in this study than have previously been measured, possibly due to higher consumption of seafood in this sample. Men had statistically higher levels of serum iron, blood lead, and serum selenium, while women had statistically higher levels of serum copper and blood manganese. Blood lead levels increased with age. Diet had a statistically significant association with several elements.

Several effects of Pb(2+) were observed: (1) the absorption peak intensity of chloroplast obviously decreased in red and blue region and produced optical flattering; (2) fluorescence quantum yield nearby 680 nm of chloroplast greatly declined; (3) the excitation band nearby 440 nm of chloroplast significantly descended; (4) Pb(2+) treatments reduced of the rate of whole chain electron transport, photochemical activities of PSII DCPIP photoreduction and oxygen evolution, but the photoreduction activities of PSI were little changed. Together, the studies of the experiments showed that Pb(2+) decreased absorption of light on spinach chloroplast and inhibited excitation energy to be absorbed by LHCII and transferred to PSII, then reduced the conversion from light energy to electron energy, and decelerated electron transport, water photolysis and oxygen evolution.","Spectrochimica acta.

Fraction-II inhibited the activities of replicative DNA polymerases (pols) such as alpha, delta and epsilon, and mitochondrial pol gamma with IC(50) values of 43-79 microg/ml, but had no influence on the activity of repair-related pols beta and lambda. MGDG, DGDG, SQDG were purified from Fraction-II of spinach using silica gel column chromatography, and SQDG was the strongest inhibitor of mammalian pols in the three glycolipids. Therefore, SQDG and its related compounds were chemically synthesized, and the sulfate group and fatty acid moiety of the compound were suggested to be important for pol inhibition. These glycolipids showed no effect even on the activities of plant pols, prokaryotic pols and other DNA metabolic enzymes such as T4 polynucleotide kinase, T7 RNA polymerase and deoxyribonuclease I. Fraction-II also inhibited the proliferation of human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) cells with LD(50) values of 57 microg/ml, and could halt the cell cycle at the G1-phase, and subsequently induced severe apoptosis.

Confidence intervals for Cd and Zn content obtained by the proposed procedure overlap with the certified values. The other procedures, however, provide inaccurate results for Cd. Recoveries obtained for a confidence level of 95% are 96+/-6% and 95+/-5% for Zn and Cd, respectively. Reproducibility of Zn by the proposed procedure is 7% (n=8), similar to the other tests and the detection limit is 2.6 microg. For Cd reproducibility is 8.5% (n=8), better than with HCl-Triton X-100 and similar to acid digestion, the detection limit is 3.5 ng of Cd.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D002104', 'D010936', 'D018515', 'D010944', 'D052616', 'D013054', 'D018724', 'D013662', 'D014026', 'D015032']","['Cadmium', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plants', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Spinacia oleracea', 'Tea', 'Tobacco', 'Zinc']",Application of pressurized fluid extraction to determine cadmium and zinc in plants.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17386428,2007
17269737,"Chloroplasts have a complex enzymatic machinery to adjust the relative half-life of their mRNAs to environmental signals. Soluble protein extracts from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts that correctly reproduce in vitro the differential mRNA stability observed in vivo were analyzed using shotgun proteomics to identify the proteins that are potentially involved in this process. The combination of a novel strategy for the database-independent detection of proteins from MS/MS data with standard database searches allowed us to identify 243 proteins with high confidence, which include several nucleases and RNA binding proteins but also proteins that have no reported function in chloroplast mRNA metabolism. Characterization of enzyme activities that adjust mRNA stability in response to illumination revealed that the dark-induced RNA degradation pathway involves enzymatic activities that differ from those that direct RNA processing and stabilization in the light. Dark-induced mRNA degradation comprises a MgCl2-independent and a MgCl2-dependent step, which releases nucleoside di- and monophosphates from the petD 3'-UTR precursor substrate. RNA degradation can be blocked with RNasin, a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic ribonucleases, suggesting that chloroplast mRNA degradation involves enzymes that are distinct from those found in prokaryotic-type RNA degradation. On the basis of the identified proteins and the in vitro characterization of the RNA degradation activities, we discuss scenarios and components that potentially determine plastid mRNA stability.",Journal of proteome research,"['D002736', 'D004798', 'D013058', 'D010940', 'D040901', 'D012333', 'D018749', 'D018724']","['Chloroplasts', 'Enzymes', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Plant Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Plant', 'Spinacia oleracea']",Proteome analysis of chloroplast mRNA processing and degradation.,"['Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235']","['metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17269737,2007

This article summarizes the different steps of a versatile strategy that has been developed to decipher plant membrane proteomes. Initiated with envelope membranes from spinach chloroplasts, this strategy has been adapted to thylakoids, and further extended to a series of membranes from the model plant Arabidopsis: chloroplast envelope membranes, plasma membrane, and mitochondrial membranes. The first step is the preparation of highly purified membrane fractions from plant tissues. The second step in the strategy is the fractionation of membrane proteins on the basis of their physico-chemical properties. Chloroform/methanol extraction and washing of membranes with NaOH, NaCl or any other agent led to the simplification of the protein content of the fraction to be analysed. The next step is the genuine proteomic step, i.e. the separation of proteins by 1D-gel electrophoresis followed by in-gel proteolytic digestion of the polypeptides, analysis of the proteolytic peptides using mass spectrometry, and protein identification by searching through databases. The last step is the validation of the procedure by checking the subcellular location.

A combined isocratic and linear gradient allowed separation of vitamins in 3 distinct groups: polar, low-polar, and nonpolar. The method was applied to pharmaceutical preparations, fortified powdered drinks, and food samples, for which results were in good agreement with values claimed. Heudi et al. described a separation of 9 water-soluble vitamins by LC-UV. The method was applied for the quantification of vitamins in polyvitaminated premixes used for the fortification of infant nutrition products. The repeatability of the method was evaluated at different concentration levels and coefficients of variation were <6.5%. The concentrations of vitamins found in premixes with the method were comparable to the values declared. A disadvantage of the methods mentioned above is that sample composition has to be known in advance. According to European legislation, for example, foods might be fortified with riboflavin phosphate or thiamin phosphate, vitamers which are not included in the simultaneous separations described. Vitamin B2.--Viñas et al. elaborated an LC analysis of riboflavin vitamers in foods. Vitamin B2 can be found in nature as the free riboflavin, but in most biological materials it occurs predominantly in the form of 2 coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Several methods usually involve the conversion of these coenzymes into free riboflavin before quantification of total riboflavin. According to the authors, there is growing interest to know flavin composition of foods. The described method separates the individual vitamers isocratically. Accuracy of the method is tested with 2 certified reference materials (CRMs). Vitamin B5.-Methods for the determination of vitamin B5 in foods are limited because of their low sensitivity and poor selectivity. Pakin et al. proposed a post-column derivatization of pantothenic acid as a fluorescent compound and used this principle in a specific and sensitive method for the determination of free and bound pantothenic acid in a large variety of foods. A French laboratory invited European laboratories to participate in a series of collaborative studies for this method, which will be carried out in 2005/2006. A more sophisticated method was described by Mittermayer et al. They developed an LC-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method for the determination of vitamin B5 in a wide range of fortified food products. Application of the method to various samples showed consistent results with those obtained by microbiology. Vitamin B6.-Method 2004.07, an LC method for the analysis of vitamin B6 in reconstituted infant formula, was published by Mann et al. In contrast with this method, which quantifies vitamin B6 after converting the phosphorylated and free vitamers into pyridoxine, Viñas et al. published an LC method which determines 6 vitamin B6 related compounds, the 3 B6 vitamers, their corresponding phosphorylated esters, and a metabolite. Accuracy was determined using 2 CRMs. Results were within the certified ranges. Vitamin C.-Franke et al. described an extensive study to vitamin C and flavonoid levels of fruits and vegetables consumed in Hawaii. Vitamin C was determined by measuring ascorbic acid in its reduced state by LC and coulometric detection along with UV absorbance detection at 245 nm. No attempts were made to assess levels of dehydroascorbic acid. Most recent research revealed that cell uptake of dehydroascorbic acid is unlikely to play a major role, which may explain the very low vitamin C activity of orally administered L-dehydroascorbic acid in rats. The food levels found by Franke et al. are variably lower, higher, or equal in comparison to other studies. Iwase described a method for the determination of ascorbic acid in foods using L-methionine for the pre-analysis sample stabilization. Electrochemical detection was used for the quantification. Traditionally, metaphosphoric acid was proven to be a useful dissolving agent for the determination of ascorbic acid. However, it dissolves in water very slowly, it is hygroscopic, and accurate weighing is not easy. Adjustment at pH 2-3 takes a long time. It appeared to be possible to replace metaphosphoric acid by 0.2% phosphoric acid. Methionine played an important role on the stability of ascorbic acid. The method seemed to be applicable to the routine analysis of ascorbic acid in foods. Folic Acid.-Microbiological analysis of total folate in foods is often considered as the golden standard compared to other methods based on, for example, LC. Koontz et al. showed results of total folate concentrations measured by microbiological assay in a variety of foods. Samples were submitted in a routine manner to experienced laboratories that regularly perform folate analysis fee-for-service basis in the United States. Each laboratory reported the use of a microbiological method similar to the AOAC Official Method for the determination of folic acid. Striking was, the use of 3 different pH extraction conditions by 4 laboratories. Only one laboratory reported using a tri-enzyme extraction. Results were evaluated. Results for folic acid fortified foods had considerably lower between-laboratory variation, 9-11%, versus >45% for other foods. Mean total folate ranged from 14 to 279 microg/100 g for a mixed vegetable reference material, from 5 to 70 microg/100 g for strawberries, and from 28 to 81 microg/100 g for wholemeal flour. One should realize a large variation in results, which might be caused by slight modifications in the microbiological analysis of total folate in foods or the analysis in various (unfortified) food matrixes. Furthermore, optimal combination of enzymes and reaction conditions may vary depending on the composition of the food. Padrangi and Laborde showed recently that treatment with alpha-amylase had no significant effect on measured folate in spinach, although addition of protease significantly increased the release of folate. LC/MS applications gain increasing attention because of their specificity. Rychlik used stable isotope dilution assays for the determination of the folate content of broccoli and bread. Compared to data in the literature and food data bases, amounts were significantly lower. Pawlosky et al., however, found comparable values for 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid and folic acid by HPLC analysis with fluorescent detection and HPLC/MS. Among samples analyzed were CRMs and broccoli. Besides folic acid, other water-soluble vitamins were also determined by LC/MS/MS by Leporati et al. The method was applied to the quantitative analysis of the natural content of vitamins in typical Italian pasta samples, as well as in fortified pasta samples produced for the U.S. market. Biotin.-A paper from Staggs et al. included the assertion that existing biotin data in food composition tables are inaccurate because the majority are based on bioassays with all relevant disadvantages. Data in most cases are overestimated with consequences for recommendations for dietary biotin intake. An HPLC/avidin-binding assay was used to analyze 87 foods to support the hypothesis mentioned.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D002623', 'D002853', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005527', 'D012015', 'D015203', 'D020349', 'D025101', 'D014815', 'D014867']","['Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Food, Fortified', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Vitamin B 6', 'Vitamins', 'Water']",Water-soluble vitamins.,"['Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['methods', None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512258,2006

A column-switching anion-exchange chromatographic method with suppressed conductivity detection, described in this paper, achieved a 3-6 microg/kg method limit of quantitation in analysis of the wet weight edible portion of cantaloupe, carrots, lettuce, and spinach samples with field-incurred perchlorate. A test portion was blended with dilute nitric acid, and the extract was filtered under vacuum. A portion of the measured filtrate was acidified to pH approximately 2 by addition of cation-exchange resin, 4 mL was passed through a graphitized carbon cleanup column, and an aliquot of a collected fraction was pushed through a short precolumn for anion extraction, enrichment, and injection onto the analytical column. Statistical comparison with determination by tandem mass spectrometry-ion chromatography analysis of untreated filtrate revealed that the difference between means was not significant at the 95% confidence level (P value > or = 0.12) for crops tested.

The number of pesticides tested increased from 232 in FY 2002 to 323 in FY 2004. The purpose of the study was to clarify the residue status by accumulating information about pesticides detected frequently, to allow effective and efficient regulation under the new ""Positive List"" legislation to be implemented in FY 2006. Overall, 47% of domestic and 61% of imported samples contained detectable residues and ca. 60% of positive samples contained multiple residues. The limit of quantitation was set at 0.01 microg/g and the limit of detection was 0.001-0.003 microg/ g. Most of the residues were present at low concentrations: 80% of the detections in samples excluding imported citrus fruits were < 0.05 microg/g. More than 5 different pesticides (> 0.01 microg/g) were detected simultaneously in 13 samples. The sum of the ratios of residues to MRLs was calculated as one of the indexes to represent the risk of multiple residues, and they exceeded 100% in 3 imported frozen vegetables; baby kidney bean, spinach, Welsh onion.

Although biological interest in this element has recently increased, limited literature exists on the Si content of foods. To further our knowledge and understanding of the relationship between dietary Si and human health, a reliable food composition database, relevant for the UK population, is required. A total of 207 foods and beverages, commonly consumed in the UK, were analysed for Si content. Composite samples were analysed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry following microwave-assisted digestion with nitric acid and H(2)O(2). The highest concentrations of Si were found in cereals and cereal products, especially less refined cereals and oat-based products. Fruit and vegetables were highly variable sources of Si with substantial amounts present in Kenyan beans, French beans, runner beans, spinach, dried fruit, bananas and red lentils, but undetectable amounts in tomatoes, oranges and onions. Of the beverages, beer, a macerated whole-grain cereal product, contained the greatest level of Si, whilst drinking water was a variable source with some mineral waters relatively high in Si.

16245052,"Proteomics is a very powerful approach to link the information contained in sequenced genomes, like Arabidopsis, to the functional knowledge provided by studies of plant cell compartments, such as chloroplast envelope membranes. This review summarizes the present state of proteomic analyses of highly purified spinach and Arabidopsis envelope membranes. Methods targeted towards the hydrophobic core of the envelope allow identifying new proteins, and especially new transport systems. Common features were identified among the known and newly identified putative envelope inner membrane transporters and were used to mine the complete Arabidopsis genome to establish a virtual plastid envelope integral protein database. Arabidopsis envelope membrane proteins were extracted using different methods, that is, chloroform/methanol extraction, alkaline or saline treatments, in order to retrieve as many proteins as possible, from the most to the less hydrophobic ones. Mass spectrometry analyses lead to the identification of more than 100 proteins. More than 50% of the identified proteins have functions known or very likely to be associated with the chloroplast envelope. These proteins are (a) involved in ion and metabolite transport, (b) components of the protein import machinery and (c) involved in chloroplast lipid metabolism. Some soluble proteins, like proteases, proteins involved in carbon metabolism or in responses to oxidative stress, were associated with envelope membranes. Almost one third of the newly identified proteins have no known function. The present stage of the work demonstrates that a combination of different proteomics approaches together with bioinformatics and the use of different biological models indeed provide a better understanding of chloroplast envelope biochemical machinery at the molecular level.",Photosynthesis research,[],[],Proteomics of chloroplast envelope membranes.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16245052,2020
16242702,"This study mainly focused on lutein content in several selected crops grown in southern Ontario, Canada. Marigold flower, a good rotation crop for the control of nematodes in tobacco fields was found to contain 0.77% lutein (after saponification, on dry basis). A high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method using a two-phase solvent system consisting of hexane-ethanol-water (6:4.5:1.5, v/v/v) was developed for the purification of lutein from the saponification mixture of marigold flower extract. The purity of lutein prepared using this HSCCC method was 97%. Free lutein was found to be the predominant form in three squash varieties, and it was mostly found in the peel rather than the commonly consumed flesh. Sweet Mamma, Buttercup and Pepper squash varieties contained 25.4, 18.4 and 30.1mg/100g fresh weigh (FW) of lutein in the peels, respectively. These concentrations were significantly higher than that in spinach and kale (3.7 and 12.3 mg/100 g FW). beta-Carotene was found most in the peel of Sweet Mamma squash at 13.6 mg/100g FW, whereas it was below 2mg/100g FW in all other samples. Cooking increased extractable free lutein by 22-65% in squash peels. Lutein in Yukon Gold potato was at ca. 0.4 mg/100 g FW. Certain Yukon Gold was also found to contain violaxanthin (0.35 mg/100 g FW). Structures of lutein, beta-carotene and violaxanthin were identified by LC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization MS in positive ion mode, and by comparing the retention time and UV-vis spectral data with standards.

16228515,"Light-harvesting proteins harness light energy for photosynthesis. Sequences of the Photosystem II (PS II) light harvesting proteins, Lhcb1-6, have been deduced from many plants. However, limited information is available for spinach Lhcb sequences, although a spinach PS II preparation (BBY) is commonly used as a model for plant photosynthetic oxygen evolution [DA Berthold, GT Babcock and CF Yocum (1981) FEBS Lett 134: 231-234]. In this work, we describe the use of tryptic digestion, liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry, and database searching to identify light-harvesting proteins in the spinach BBY preparation. Using this approach, partial amino acid sequences were assigned to the PS II-associated light-harvesting proteins, Lhcb1-6. The identified stretches of sequence are predicted to contain intra-membranous chlorophyll ligands, extra-membranous loop regions, and lutein-binding sites. In addition, we find that at least two distinct Lhcb4 (CP29) polypeptides and two distinct Lhcb1 polypeptides are present in the BBY preparation. One of these Lhcb4 polypeptides has a subsequence that has not been reported for Lhcb4 in any other organism.

16159161,"Two competitive immunoassays, a laboratory assay based on microwell plates and a field test based on the use of polystyrene tubes, have been developed for the detection of endosulfan in agricultural products. The limit of detection for the microwell plate format was 0.8 +/- 0.1 microg/kg, and the limit of detection for the tube format was 1.6 +/- 0.2 microg/kg.

Dilution of the methanol extract before SBSE was optimized to obtain high sensitivity and to minimize adsorption onto the glass wall of the extraction vessel as well as to minimize sample matrix effects (particularly for the pesticides with high log K(o,w) values). The optimized method consists of a dual SBSE extraction performed simultaneously on respectively a twofold and a fivefold diluted methanol extract.

PCBs, PCDFs and PCDDs suspended in nonane were incubated with RBF (10 mg/ml) at 37 degrees C and after centrifugation, unbound chemicals in the supernatant were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). The binding effects on RBF were enhanced more than other dietary fibers (DFs), which were tested including corn, wheat bran, spinach, Hijiki (a kind of seaweed), sweet potatoes and burdock fibers. It was found that the binding effects were related to lignin contents. Binding of 3-amino-1(or 1,4)-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-p-1 and Trp-p-2), food-derived carcinogens and 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), suspended in methanol, to RBF occurred within 10 min of incubation at 37 degrees C at pH 5-7, and decreased below pH 4; binding of food-derived carcinogens was pH dependent. The binding effects to RBF and pulp lignin were obtained at ratio of over 90%, while corn fiber and cellulose were at ratios of 4-30%. Polycyclic aromatic compounds were related to the number of rings, showing high binding effects to chemical structures with triple rings. Binding of 1-NP and PCB to RBF was not influenced in any aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures. It was also found that RBF was capable of binding even conjugates containing mutagens such as glucuronides and sulfates, as well as metabolites in urine. It was suggested, therefore, that mutagens and carcinogens were available for the fecal excretion of residual chemicals and their metabolites, and also for the fecal excretion of PCBs, PCDFs and related compound residues in patients of Yusho disease, who suffered food poisoning due to rice oil contaminated with PCB in Japan.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,"['D001420', 'D001421', 'D001572', 'D002243', 'D002274', 'D000072338', 'D004043', 'D004147', 'D006801', 'D008031', 'D009152', 'D009153', 'D012275', 'D011078', 'D011084', 'D011721', 'D012907']","['Bacteria, Aerobic', 'Bacteria, Anaerobic', 'Benzofurans', 'Carbolines', 'Carcinogens, Environmental', 'Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Dioxins', 'Humans', 'Lignin', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens', 'Oryza', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons', 'Pyrenes', 'Smoking']",Binding effect of polychlorinated compounds and environmental carcinogens on rice bran fiber.,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000652']","['metabolism', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'pharmacology', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'urine']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15629241,2005

15038113,"The objective of this study was to elucidate the utility of ion-trap GC/MS/MS for the analysis of pesticides in extracted matrices from various agricultural products. Identification and quantitative analysis of pesticides in matrices were performed by quadrupole GC/MS and ion-trap GC/MS/MS.

Although most of the pesticides in the matrix could not be determined by quadrupole GC/MS-Scan analysis at 0.1 microgram/mL, every pesticide was identified from the mass spectrum using ion-trap GC/MS/MS at the same concentration. The quantitation limit of every pesticide in each matrix by ion-trap GC/MS/MS analysis was higher than that by GC/MS-SIM analysis. The calibration curves obtained by GC/MS/MS were linear in the range of 0.01-0.25 microgram/mL of each pesticide.

14969513,"A simple, specific, and rapid analytical method for determining seven largely used carbamate insecticides in tomato, spinach, lettuce, zucchini, pear, and apple is here presented. This method is based on the matrix solid-phase dispersion technique, with heated water as extractant followed by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) equipped with a single quadrupole and an electrospray ion source. Target compounds were extracted from the vegetal matrixes by water heated at 50 degrees C. After acidification and filtration, 0.25 mL of any aqueous extract was injected in the LC column. MS data acquisition was performed in the selected ion monitoring mode, selecting three ions for each target compound. Heated water appeared to be an excellent extractant because recovery data ranged between 76 (carbaryl in spinach) and 99% (pirimicarb in spinach), with RSDs not larger than 10%. Using trimethacarb (an obsolete carbamate insecticide) as a surrogate internal standard, the accuracy of the analysis varied between 84 and 110%, with RSDs not larger than 9%. On the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, limits of quantification were estimated to range between 2 (pirimicarb) and 10 ppb (oxamyl) and were not influenced by the type of matrix. When trying to fractionate analytes by using a short chromatographic run time, marked weakening of the ion signals for oxamyl, methomyl, and aldicarb were observed. This effect was traced to polar endogenous co-extractives eluted in the first part of the chromatographic run that interfered with gas-phase ion formation for carbamates.

Subjects were administered a single dose of deuterium-labeled carotenoids from intrinsically labeled spinach or collard green; 10 mL blood samples were drawn at various time points over a 34 days period. The vegetables had been hydroponically grown using 25 atom-% deuterated water. Lutein molecules in the vegetables were partially deuterated with a highest abundance isotopomer at M(0) + 8 (unlabeled molecular mass, M(0,) plus 8 additional mass units from 8 deuterium atoms in the molecules). This allowed labeled lutein to be distinguished from endogenous lutein in serum samples after consuming the labeled meal. The presence of labeled lutein in the circulation was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface. The quantification of the labeled lutein in serum samples enabled the calculation of the enrichment for each time point after the dose; these values were plotted vs. time to generate absorption-clearance curves for each of the subjects.

Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables.

12810415,"Leafy vegetables such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea) are known to contain moderate amounts of soluble and insoluble oxalates. Frozen commercially available spinach in New Zealand contains 736.6+/-20.4 mg/100g wet matter (WM) soluble oxalate and 220.1+/-96.5mg/100g WM insoluble oxalate. The frozen spinach contained 90mg total calcium/100g WM, 76.7%of this calcium was unavailable as it was bound to oxalate as insoluble oxalate. The oxalate/calcium (mEq) ratio of the frozen spinach was 4.73. When frozen convenience food is grilled there is no opportunity for the soluble oxalates to be leached out into the cooking water and discarded. Soluble oxalates, when consumed, have the ability to bind to calcium in the spinach and any calcium in foods consumed with the spinach, reducing the absorption of soluble oxalate. In this experiment 10 volunteers ingested 100g grilled spinach alone or with 100g additions of cottage cheese, sour cream and sour cream with Calci-Trim milk (180 g) and finally, with 20g olive oil.

12730414,"Choline is important for normal membrane function, acetylcholine synthesis and methyl group metabolism; the choline requirement for humans is 550 mg/d for men (Adequate Intake). Betaine, a choline derivative, is important because of its role in the donation of methyl groups to homocysteine to form methionine. In tissues and foods, there are multiple choline compounds that contribute to total choline concentration (choline, glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin). In this study, we collected representative food samples and analyzed the choline concentration of 145 common foods using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Foods with the highest total choline concentration (mg/100 g) were: beef liver (418), chicken liver (290), eggs (251), wheat germ (152), bacon (125), dried soybeans (116) and pork (103). The foods with the highest betaine concentration (mg/100 g) were: wheat bran (1339), wheat germ (1241), spinach (645), pretzels (237), shrimp (218) and wheat bread (201).

12177442,"A two-membrane system, or envelope, surrounds plastids. Because of the integration of chloroplast metabolism within the plant cell, the envelope is the site of many specific transport activities. However, only a few proteins involved in the processes of transport across the chloroplast envelope have been identified already at the molecular level. To discover new envelope transporters, we developed a subcellular proteomic approach, which is aimed to identify the most hydrophobic envelope proteins. This strategy combined the use of highly purified and characterized membrane fractions, extraction of the hydrophobic proteins with organic solvents, SDS/PAGE separation, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. To process the large amount of MS/MS data, a blast-based program was developed for searching in protein, expressed sequence tag, and genomic plant databases. Among the 54 identified proteins, 27 were new envelope proteins, with most of them bearing multiple alpha-helical transmembrane regions and being very likely envelope transporters. The present proteomic study also allowed us to identify common features among the known and newly identified putative envelope inner membrane transporters. These features were used to mine the complete Arabidopsis genome and allowed us to establish a virtual plastid envelope integral protein database. Altogether, both proteomic and in silico approaches identified more than 50 candidates for the as yet previously uncharacterized plastid envelope transporters. The predictable function of some of these proteins opens up areas of investigation that may lead to a better understanding of the chloroplast metabolism.

A standard solid phase extraction (SPE) method was used for the extraction of anabasine from viscera, but was optimized for the extraction of this alkaloid from plant material. The careful selection of mobile phase components allowed the direct coupling of electron impact (EI) and Z spray mass selective detector (ZMD) of the HPLC. Under these conditions, anabasine was well separated from nicotine and could be detected on the PDA (limit of detection, LOD = 250 ng/ml), TMD (LOD = 10 microg/ml) and ZMD (LOD =1 ng/ml) detectors. Three geographically isolated N. glauca trees were analyzed for alkaloid content and it was found that both the leaves and the flowers contain anabasine. The optimized HPLC method was used to analyze two viscera samples (the stomach and contents of a mother and child who putatively died from food poisoning) and a flower exhibit. Anabasine was detected in both the viscera samples, supporting the finding that these fatalities were due to the ingestion of N. glauca accidentally collected with traditional spinach (marog).

The proposed method is selective for lipophilic compounds having antioxidant power. When applied to pure compounds, the order of antioxidant power resulted as follows: lycopene > beta-carotene > zeaxanthin > alpha-carotene > beta-cryptoxanthin > lutein > alpha-tocopherol > capsaicin > chlorophyll a > chlorophyll b > astaxanthin > canthaxanthin.

The method has a satisfactory day-to-day repeatability (never,more than 10%) and a very low detection limit (0.02 pmol per injection). Depending on the folate studied, the recovery rates varied from 78% (10-CHO-PteGlu) to 98% (5-CHO-H4PteGlu). Furthermore it has been possible to show that the deconjugation of the folates by rat plasma conjugase was incomplete in foodstuffs whereas chicken pancreas conjugase effectively converted the different folate polyglutamates into folate diglutamates. It could not be demonstrated that prior hydrolysis with a protease and amylase was useful for the analysis of the different foodstuffs studied (yeast, spinach, beef liver, beef fillet and peas) when deconjugation was performed with the chicken pancreas conjugase.",Journal of chromatography.

11409964,"Thirteen compounds, isolated from spinach (Spinacia oleracea), acted as antimutagens against the dietary carcinogen 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98. The antimutagens were purified by preparative and micropreparative HPLC from a methanol/water (70:30, v/v) extract of dry spinach (commercial product) after removal of lipophilic compounds such as chlorophylls and carotenoids by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Pure active compounds were identified by instrumental analysis including FT-IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR, UV-vis spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. All of these compounds were flavonoids and related compounds that could be attributed to five groups: (A, methylenedioxyflavonol glucuronides) 5,3'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-6,7-methylenedioxyflavonol 3-O-beta-glucuronide (compound 1), 5,2',3'-trihydroxy-4'-methoxy-6,7-methylenedioxyflavonol 3-O-beta-glucuronide (compound 2), 5-hydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxy-6,7-methylenedioxyflavonol 3-O-beta-glucuronide (compound 3); (B, flavonol glucuronides) 5,6,3'-trihydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxyflavonol 3-O-beta-glucuronide (compound 4), 5,6-dihydroxy-7,3',4'-trimethoxyflavonol 3-O-beta-glucuronide (compound 5); (C, flavonol disaccharides) 5,6,4'-trihydroxy-7,3'-dimethoxyflavonol 3-O-disaccharide (compound 6), 5,6,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-7-methoxyflavonol 3-O-disaccharide (compounds 7 and 8); (D, flavanones) 5,8,4'-trihydroxyflavanone (compound 9), 7,8,4'-trihydroxyflavanone (compound 10); (E, flavonoid-related compounds) compounds 11, 12, and 13 with incompletely elucidated structures.

After a cell breakdown of the eatable parts and centrifugation of the resulting homogenates all supernatants (cytosols) were separated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The size-range of the GPC method used was about 20-8000 kDa for globular proteins. The high molecular weight (HMW-Cd-SP, 150-700 kDa) and the low molecular weight Cd species (LMW-Cd-SP, < 150 kDa) in all plant cytosols eluted at about the same retention volume by GPC. The most important Cd binding form in the cytosols of all plants was found to be HMW-Cd-SP. The Cd elution maxima were detected in the range of about 200 kDa. The Cd determinations were performed with ET-AAS by means of matrix modifier. By incubating chosen cytosols with a proteinase before the GPC it was verified that the HMW-Cd-SP in both vegetables are Cd proteins. The molar proportions protein/Cd were about 2-6 in the respective GPC fractions of the HMW-Cd-SP of the highest contaminated plants. The GPC fractions of the HMW-Cd-SP of spinach and radish were further separated by a preparative, native and continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) method. At pH 8 the species were negatively charged, had only a small UV-absorption at 280 nm and showed a very similar elution behavior in all analyzed cytosols.

11048781,"Epidemologic studies have shown inverse correlation between the consumption of carotenoid-rich vegetables and the incidence of cancer. Therefore, analytical techniques for the quantitative determination of carotenoids in complex sample matrices are important. The most used method is reversed-phase (RP)-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In this study, seventeen mobile-phase systems described in the literature and six RP-HPLC columns with differences in particle size and porosity are evaluated. Derived from these results, a new mobile-phase (acetonitrile, methanol, chloroform, and n-heptane) including solvent modifiers is presented, which allows an improved and more efficient separation of carotenoids. From all columns tested, the best chromatographic parameters are found using a silica C18 column (250 x 2 mm, 5 microm, 100 A). As was found, absorbance detection at 450 nm allows the determination of the carotenoids down to the picogram range with good linearity (R2 > 0.98). For the identification and quantitation of carotenoids in complex sample matrices (containing additionally other ultraviolet-absorbing compounds), the optimized RP chromatographic system is coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS) using an atmospheric pressure ionization interface. The calibration plots show high linearity (R2 > 0.99), and the detection limit is found in the lower nanogram range. Furthermore, collision-induced dissociation in the ion source allows for the identification of carotenoids by their characteristic fragmentation pathways. In this study, a total of nine species of vegetables commonly consumed in Central Europe are analyzed for their contents of carotenoids (namely lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, and beta-carotene) by RP-HPLC and RP-HPLC-MS-MS.

All the basic and other food items used in these calculations had been analysed by HPLC and about 170 of the items had been obtained and assayed in the UK. Recipe calculations took account of the cooking method and changes in water and fat content. Currently, approximately 1501 food items with Royal Society of Chemistry/Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food food codes have been allocated a vitamin K1 value, and a further 282 new recipe codes are included in the database. Representative values from each food group are reported together with an indication of the potential variation. Detailed examples of some recipe calculations are included, and also the impact of changing the type of fat in recipes. Vitamin K1 is associated with, and most abundant in, photosynthetic tissues of plants. Accordingly, the highest concentrations (3000-6000 micrograms/kg) are found in dark-green leafy vegetables and herbs, such as kale, parsley, spinach and green cabbage. Intermediate concentrations (1000-2000 micrograms/kg) are found in plants with paler leaves such as white cabbage and lettuce or in green, non-leafy vegetables such as broccoli and brussel sprouts. Fats and oils contain variable amounts of vitamin K1 with the highest concentrations (300-1300 micrograms/kg) in soyabean, rapeseed and olive oils and the margarines based on them. Other foods such as dairy products, meat dishes and cereal-based foods (bread, biscuits, cakes, desserts etc.), although not in themselves particularly rich in vitamin K1 (< 200 micrograms/kg), may contribute significantly to intakes when consumption of green vegetables is poor.

10847603,"This article describes a method for the enzymatic detection of low-abundant metabolic intermediates in plant extracts via NAD(P)H fluorescence using a microtiter plate reader. The detection of changes in NAD(P)H fluorescence (excitation 340 nm, emission 465 nm) exhibits a high signal-to-noise ratio and is as sensitive (> or = 20 pmol per well) as absorbance measurements with dual-wavelength photometers. Since up to 96 reactions can be initiated, monitored, and evaluated simultaneously, this method might be suitable for high-throughput screening programs on metabolite profiles. However, in contrast to absorbance measurements, fluorescence detection of NAD(P)H yields relative data, which can be impaired by the quench characteristics and the basic fluorescence of the extracts. Hence, extensive calibration is required to gain reproducible results.

Concentrations of inorganic arsenic in food have not been not well characterized. Accurate dietary intake estimates for inorganic arsenic are needed to support studies of arsenic's status as an essential nutrient, and to establish background levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic. In the market basket survey reported here, 40 commodities anticipated to provide at least 90% of dietary inorganic arsenic intake were identified. Four samples of each commodity were collected. Total arsenic was analysed using an NaOH digestion and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Separate aliquots were analysed for arsenic species using an HCl digestion and hydride atomic absorption spectroscopy. Consistent with earlier studies, total arsenic concentrations (all concentrations reported as elemental arsenic per tissue wet weight) were highest in the seafoods sampled (ranging from 160 ng/g in freshwater fish to 2360 ng/g in saltwater fish). In contrast, average inorganic arsenic in seafood ranged from less than 1 ng/g to 2 ng/g. The highest inorganic arsenic values were found in raw rice (74 ng/g), followed by flour (11 ng/g), grape juice (9 ng/g) and cooked spinach (6 ng/g).

It was found that (a) the characteristic period four oscillations of the normalized components of DeltaA830(t) relaxation and of F(t)/F0 rise in the nanosecond and microsecond time domain are significantly modified when exchangeable protons are replaced by deuterons; (b) in marked contrast to the normalized steady-state extent of the microsecond kinetics of 830 nm absorption changes which increases only slightly due to H/D exchange (about 10%) the Si state-dependent pattern exhibits marked effects that are most pronounced after the first, fourth, fifth, and eighth flashes; (c) regardless of data evaluation by different fit procedures the results lead to a consistent conclusion, that is, the relative extent of the back reaction between P680(+)*QA-* becomes enhanced in samples suspended in D2O; and (d) this enhancement is dependent on the Si state of the WOC and attains maximum values in S2 and S3, most likely due to a retardation of the ""35 micros kinetics"" of P680(+)* reduction.

9753445,"The xanthophyll cycle-dependent dissipation of excitation energy in higher plants is one of the most important regulatory and photoprotective mechanisms in photosynthesis. Using parallel time-resolved and pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometry, we studied the influence of the intrathylakoid pH and the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids on the PSII chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence yield in thylakoids of Arabidopsis, spinach, and barley. Increases in concentrations of dithiothreitol in thylakoids, which have a trans-thylakoid membrane pH gradient and are known to have decreased conversion of violaxanthin (V) to zeaxanthin (Z), lead to (1) decreases in the fractional intensity of the approximately 0.5 ns Chl a fluorescence lifetime (tau) distribution component and simultaneous increases in a 1.6-1.8 ns fluorescence component and (2) increases in the maximal fluorescence intensity. These effects disappear when the pH gradient is eliminated by the addition of nigericin. To quantitatively explain these results, we present a new mathematical model that describes the simultaneous effects of the chloroplast trans-thylakoid membrane pH gradient and xanthophyll cycle pigments on the PSII Chl a fluorescence tau distributions and intensity. The model assumes that (1) there exists a specific binding site for Z (or antheraxanthin, A) among or in an inner antenna complex (primarily CP29), (2) this binding site is activated by a low intrathylakoid pH (pK approximately 4.5) that increases the affinity for Z (or A), (3) about one Z or A molecule binds to the activated site, and (4) this binding effectively ""switches"" the fluorescence tau distribution of the PSII unit to a state with a decreased fluorescence tau and emission intensity (a ""dimmer switch"" concept). This binding is suggested to cause the formation of an exciton trap with a rapid intrinsic rate constant of heat dissipation. Statistical analysis of the data yields an equilibrium association constant, Ka, that ranges from 0.7 to 3.4 per PSII for the protonated/activated binding site for Z (or A). The model explains (1) the relative fraction of the approximately 0.5 ns fluorescence component as a function of both Z and A concentration and intrathylakoid pH, (2) the dependence of the ratio of F'm/Fm on the fraction of the 0.5 ns fluorescence tau component (where F'm and Fm are maximal fluorescence intensities in the presence and the absence of a pH gradient), and (3) the dependence of the ratio of F'm/Fm on the concentration of Z and A and the intrathylakoid pH.",Biochemistry,"['D002338', 'D002734', 'D000077194', 'D002736', 'D005454', 'D001467', 'D006863', 'D007425', 'D014975', 'D010777', 'D010860', 'D013050', 'D018724', 'D024341', 'D065146', 'D019207']","['Carotenoids', 'Chlorophyll', 'Chlorophyll A', 'Chloroplasts', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Hordeum', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Lutein', 'Photochemistry', 'Pigments, Biological', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spinacia oleracea', 'Xanthophylls', 'Zeaxanthins', 'beta Carotene']",Quantitative analysis of the effects of intrathylakoid pH and xanthophyll cycle pigments on chlorophyll a fluorescence lifetime distributions and intensity in thylakoids.,"['Q000031', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000031']","['analogs & derivatives', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'analogs & derivatives']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9753445,1998
9735161,"A rapid procedure for the purification of the redox-regulated chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase [EC 3.1.3.11] from spinach leaf extract to homogeneity is described. No thiol-reducing agents were present during the purification and the enzyme is > 99% in the oxidized form. A rapid procedure to reduce and activate the Fru-1,6-P2ase by dithiothreitol in the absence of thioredoxin is described. Reduction activates the enzyme up to several hundred-fold when assayed at pH 8.0 with 2 mM Mg2+. The activity of the purified oxidized enzyme is unusually sensitive to changes in Mg2+ and H+ concentration. Tenfold changes in Mg2+ or H+ concentration lead to > 100-fold increases in activity. The recoveries of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity as determined by the activity of the oxidized enzyme at pH 8.0/20 mM Mg2+; pH 9.0/2 mM Mg2+; pH 8/2 mM Mg2+ plus 0.1 mM Hg(II) or of the reduced enzyme at pH 8.0/2 mM Mg2+ are similar (approximately 40%) indicating that the major proportion of these activities in a leaf extract is catalyzed by the same enzyme. Moreover, antibodies raised against the purified enzyme inhibit all of the above activities in crude leaf extracts. The kinetic properties of the purified enzyme suggest that the oxidized Mg(2+)-dependent enzyme can play no significant role in photosynthetic carbon assimilation. A survey of some kinetic properties of Fru-1,6-P2ase activity in extracts of various photosynthetic organisms reveals that all 11 species examined possess a redox- and pH/Mg(2+)-stimulated Fru-1,6-P2ase, whereas Fru-1,6-P2ase in extracts of Taxus baccata (a gymnosperm), Chlorella vulgaris (a green alga), and the cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum were not activated by Hg(II). The heat stability that proved useful in the purification of the spinach enzyme was conserved in both angiosperms and gymnosperms. The oxidized enzyme (which normally has no thiol groups accessible to 5,5'-dithio-bis[2-nitrobenzoic acid]) but not the reduced enzyme can be stimulated many hundred-fold by addition of extraordinarily low concentrations of Hg(II) to a complete assay mixture. With the aid of EDTA as a Hg(II) buffer, half-maximal stimulation was achieved at 2 x 10(-16) M free Hg(II). Methylmercury also stimulates the enzyme many hundred-fold at very low concentrations. The concentration for half-maximal stimulation by methylmercury was determined with a cyanide buffer to be approximately 10(-16) M. This, together with the high affinity of the enzyme for Hg(II), suggests that Hg(II) stimulates the enzyme by binding to an enzyme thiol group that be comes exposed in the catalytically active enzyme, thereby stabilizing the oxidized enzyme in an active conformation. By contrast, in the absence of Fru-1,6-P2 and either Mg2+ or Ca2+, Hg(II) (even at 2 x 10(-16) M) rapidly inactivates the oxidized Fru-1,6-P2ase. This inactivation is similar to the inactivation of Fru-1,6-P2ase that occurred at high pH (> 9) and which is also prevented by Fru-1,6-P2 and either Mg2+ or Ca2+. Although the Hg(II)- and high pH-inactivated oxidized enzyme has no activity, both forms of the enzyme can be activated by reduction. The usefulness of buffers to maintain low, defined Hg(II) and organic mercurial concentrations is discussed.",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,"['D000478', 'D055598', 'D002627', 'D002736', 'D002850', 'D004305', 'D004789', 'D004795', 'D006597', 'D006358', 'D006863', 'D007700', 'D008274', 'D017669', 'D010084', 'D010744', 'D018724', 'D013438']","['Alkylation', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Chloroplasts', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Fructose-Bisphosphatase', 'Hot Temperature', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Magnesium', 'Mercury Compounds', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Spinacia oleracea', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds']","A simple procedure for purifying the major chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and characterization of its stimulation by sub-femtomolar mercuric ions.","[None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9735161,1998

Malonyl-CoA concentrations were also very low (<0.1-3.0 microM) during fatty acid synthesis but could be calculated from radioactivity incorporated from [1-14C]acetate. Concentrations of CoASH in chloroplasts synthesizing fatty acids could be doubled in the presence of Triton X-100, suggesting that the detergent stimulates fatty acid synthesis by increasing the turnover rate of acyl-CoA. However, although taken up, exogenous CoASH (1 microM) did not stimulate fatty acid synthesis by permeabilized spinach chloroplasts. Calculated rates for acetyl-CoA synthetase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and malonyl-CoA-acyl-carrier protein transacylase reactions at the concentrations of metabolites measured here are < 0.1-4% of the observed rates of fatty acid synthesis from acetate by isolated chloroplasts.

9038145,"The large subunit core of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase from Synechococcus PCC 6301 expressed in Escherichia coli in the absence of its small subunits retains a trace of carboxylase activity (about 1% of the kcat of the holoenzyme) (Andrews, T. J (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12213-12219). During steady-state catalysis at substrate saturation, this residual activity diverted approximately 10% of the reaction flux to 1-deoxy-D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose-5-phosphate as a result of beta elimination of inorganic phosphate from the first reaction intermediate, the 2,3-enediol form of ribulose bisphosphate. This indicates that the active site's ability to stabilize and/or retain this intermediate is compromised by the absence of small subunits. Epimerization and isomerization of the substrate resulting from misprotonation of the enediol intermediate were not significantly exacerbated by lack of small subunits. The residual carboxylating activity partitioned product between pyruvate and 3-phosphoglycerate in a ratio similar to that of the holoenzyme, indicating that stablization of the penultimate three-carbon aci-acid intermediate is not perturbed by lack of small subunits. The underlying instability of the five-carbon enediol intermediate was revealed, even with the holoenzyme, under conditions designed to lead to exhaustion of substrate CO2 (and O2). When carboxylation (and oxygenation) stalled upon exhaustion of gaseous substrate, both spinach and Synechococcus holoenzymes continued slowly to beta eliminate inorganic phosphate from and to misprotonate the enediol intermediate. With carboxylation and oxygenation blocked, the products of these side reactions of the enediol intermediate accumulated to readily detectable levels, illustrating the difficulties attendant upon ribulose-P2 carboxylase's use of this reactive species as a catalytic intermediate.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D001881', 'D002851', 'D000458', 'D011495', 'D008958', 'D010084', 'D011487', 'D019289', 'D012273']","['Borates', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyanobacteria', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Models, Molecular', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Conformation', 'Pyruvic Acid', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase']",Side reactions catalyzed by ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase in the presence and absence of small subunits.,"['Q000494', None, 'Q000201', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","['pharmacology', None, 'enzymology', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9038145,1997

8774731,"The non-denaturing substitution of cluster iron by other metals was studied in spinach ferredoxin and in bovine adrenodoxin. Only some of several metal species tested (Cd2+, Zn2+, VO2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+) caused bleaching of the residual visible absorbance and of the EPR signals of the reduced ferredoxins. No formation of mixed-metal cluster was observed. The most reactive metal species were Cd2+ and Zn2+ and Cd2+ was found to react also with oxidized adrenodoxin. Metal-treated proteins were resolved into a mixture of apoprotein, metal-substituted protein and unreacted holoprotein. Their biological activity was proportional to the residual holoprotein concentration. Spinach ferredoxin and adrenodoxin were found to differ substantially with regard to their metal-substitution reactivity under oxidizing and reducing conditions, reaction time, and formation of apoprotein, which was more pronounced for spinach ferredoxin. Exchange of cluster iron with Cd2+ in adrenodoxin generated stable species containing 2 mol sulfide/mol protein and 2 or 5 mol cadmium/mol protein, respectively. The relative amount of the two substitution products depended on the experimental conditions. CD and NMR data on all the cadmium-substituted proteins suggest that iron replacement led to a significant structural rearrangement. Nevertheless, all the metal-substituted proteins could be re-converted into the native iron-containing form upon incubation with iron in the absence of reductants, of denaturing agents, and of an external source of sulfide.

Upon transformation of Escherichia coli and induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, centrifugation of the lysate partitioned 10% of the fusion protein in the supernatant fraction and the remaining 90% in the precipitate. The expected 65 kDa protein was purified from both the soluble and the particulate fraction by affinity chromatography on columns of glutathione-agarose. This fusion protein was successfully used to produce a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognized the CFBPase region of the fusion protein but not the GT moiety. Moreover, the monoclonal antibody immunoreacted not only with polypeptides (ca. 40 kDa) present in leaf crude extracts of other varieties of wheat (Triticum spelta, T. aestivum and T. durum), but also with homogeneous preparations of the spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) enzymes.

8573579,"A minimal chloroplast coupling factor CF1 core complex, containing only alpha and beta subunits, has been isolated from spinach thylakoids [Avital, S., & Gromet-Elhanan, Z. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7067-7072]. This CF1(alpha beta) exhibited a low MgATPase activity, which was stimulated but not inhibited by low concentrations of the species-specific CF1 effector tentoxin. As is reported here, the structure of CF1(alpha beta) could not be determined due to its instability. However, its pretreatment with high tentoxin concentrations resulted in a remarkable 50-fold stimulation of the MgATPase activity as well as stabilization of its hexameric structure, thus enabling the isolation of a more active CF1-alpha 3 beta 3 complex by size-exclusion chromatography. A detailed characterization of the MgATPase activity of this tentoxin-stabilized CF1-alpha 3 beta 3 hexamer, as compared to the activity of a CF1 complex lacking the epsilon subunit, revealed similar apparent Km values and a similar stimulation by the presence of 100 microM tentoxin in the assay medium, but drastic differences in all other tested assays. Most pronounced were their different temperature profiles and different responses to all added inhibitors and stimulators of the CF1 MgATPase activity and to excess free Mg2+ ions. The specific properties of the stable CF1-alpha 3 beta 3 hexamer are identical to those earlier reported for its parent-unstable CF1(alpha beta). These results indicate that, although the CF1 gamma subunit is not required for the low CF1(alpha beta) ATPase activity nor for the higher activity of the tentoxin-stabilized CF1-alpha 3 beta 3, it plays a central role in obtaining the typical functional properties of the CF1-ATPase. Kinetic cooperativity could not be critically tested as yet with any F1-alpha 3 beta 3. However, tentoxin, as azide, has been shown to inhibit multisite but not unisite catalysis. Therefore, the observation that CF1-alpha 3 beta 3 is only stimulated by tentoxin suggests that the required presence of CF1-gamma for obtaining inhibition by tentoxin reflects the role of this subunit in cooperative interactions between the catalytic sites.",Biochemistry,"['D000255', 'D017301', 'D002736', 'D002851', 'D004305', 'D004791', 'D004795', 'D006868', 'D046911', 'D010456', 'D011487', 'D006180', 'D018724']","['Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase', 'Chloroplasts', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Hydrolysis', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Peptides, Cyclic', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases', 'Spinacia oleracea']","Spinach chloroplast coupling factor CF1-alpha 3 beta 3 core complex: structure, stability, and catalytic properties.","['Q000378', 'Q000037', 'Q000201', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000037', 'Q000201']","['metabolism', 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'enzymology', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'pharmacology', None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8573579,1996

Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of DDT complex and gamma-HCH by breast-fed infants in Kafr El-Zayat were 85.96 and 3.1% of the respective acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). beta-HCH residues showed an increasing pattern, especially in human milk samples from Cairo. DDT complex and HCH isomers in orange, spinach, lettuce, potatoes, and clover samples ranged from undetectable to very low concentrations. Higher levels of DDT and HCH were detected, but aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, and the heptachlors were not detected in food of animal origin.

The NADH-hexacyanoferrate(III) reductase was released from the membrane by Chaps solubilization and purified 360-fold by ion-exchange chromatography followed by affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography on FPLC. A major band of 45 kDa and a minor contaminant of 66 kDa were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The band at 45 kDa cross-reacted with antibodies raised against an NADH-hexacyanoferrate(III) reductase from potato tuber microsomes. The native size of the enzyme was 160 kDa as determined by size-exclusion chromatography indicating that it is a tetramer. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, followed by SDS-PAGE revealed three main bands of identical molecular weight with pI of 5.3-5.6.

Comparative values are given from a background area, namely a domestic garden located in the North Yorkshire Dales National Park area. Analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quality control assessment using four international biological reference materials; BCR:CRM 62 Olive Leaves, NIST 1575 Pine Needles, NIST 1573 Tomato Leaves, and NIST 1572 Citrus Leaves. Inter-analytical method comparison is given using two methods of ICP-MS; namely conventional pneumatic nebulisation of sample solution, and direct solids analysis by laser ablation; and neutron activation analysis methods (NAA). For the elements listed there is a good precision obtained by ICP-MS and NAA. In particular levels of < +/- 1-10% (rsd) are obtained. Comparison of data with certified values and other analytical methods are generally of very good agreement. Lead levels in background areas ranged from 0.0008 to 0.340 microgram/g (fresh weight) for plant material; with the lead magnitude greater for grasses > herbs > vegetables > cereals > fruits. Measured values are in good agreement with reported literature values. The lowest Pb values are for marrow, lettuce, tomato and sweet corn samples (approximately 0.001-0.021 microgram/g). 'Green' leaf material levels were approximately 0.02-0.10 microgram/g (i.e. sprouts and cabbage).

The stoichiometry of centers A, B, and X, determined by EPR intensity measurements, gives direct evidence for center X being a [4Fe-4S] center in the native system and for the core reaction center protein being a dimer. The directions of the magnetic axes of centers A, B, and X were accurately determined by EPR experiments carried out on membrane fragments oriented on thin Mylar films. These directions are very similar to those previously reported for plants and algae. To get a detailed description of the relative arrangement of A and B, the magnetic interactions between these centers have been analyzed through numerical simulations of X-band and Q-band EPR spectra. The relative orientation of the magnetic axes deduced from these simulations is fully consistent with that given by oriented multilayer experiments. Numerical simulations of X-band and Q-band EPR spectra given by spinach PSI lead to a very similar set of structural parameters, which demonstrates that the functional unit of PSI is highly conserved in all photosynthetic organisms.

1929431,"Recent preparations of nitrite reductase do not display the heterodimeric quaternary structure obtained previously (total molecular weight 85,000; subunit molecular weights 24,000 and 61,000), but rather yield only the 61,000 molecular weight subunit, even when buffers containing the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride are used. Nevertheless, such preparations retain the high ratio of ferredoxin-linked to methyl viologen-linked enzyme activity which has been previously taken as a characteristic of only the heterodimeric form. These preparations display a siroheme prosthetic group to protein ratio of 1.1. When nitrite reductase samples are frozen during the purification scheme, even though the ferredoxin-linked specific activity does not significantly decrease, enzyme activity-stained native gel electrophoresis of the subsequently purified protein reveals that gels with several bands of activity can be obtained. Further evidence of protein heterogeneity in these preparations comes from N-terminal amino acid analysis which reveals that even nonfrozen preparations contain two major peptides with valine and cysteine as the N-termini. Formation of complexes of purified nitrite reductase with ferredoxin resulted in siroheme difference electronic spectra which resembled those observed previously for monomeric preparations. However, the siroheme midpoint potential of recent preparations of nitrite reductase (-287 mV) is close to that of the heterodimeric preparations. Ultrafiltration studies of crude extracts of the enzyme indicate that, at least at certain stages of the preparation, higher molecular weight forms of the enzyme may exist. We conclude that the 24,000 molecular weight polypeptide is a contaminant and that the heterodimeric quaternary structure model for spinach nitrite reductase is incorrect.

1903385,"Pyruvate is a minor product of the reaction catalyzed by ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from spinach leaves. Labeled pyruvate was detected, in addition to the major labeled product, 3-phosphoglycerate, when 14CO2 was the substrate. Pyruvate production was also measured spectrophotometrically in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase and NADH. The Km for CO2 of the pyruvate-producing activity was 12.5 microM, similar to the CO2 affinity of the 3-phosphoglycerate-producing activity. No pyruvate was detected by the coupled assay when ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate was replaced by 3-phosphoglycerate or when the carboxylase was inhibited by the reaction-intermediate analog, 2'-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. Therefore, pyruvate was not being produced from 3-phosphoglycerate by contaminant enzymes. The ratio of pyruvate produced to ribulose bisphosphate consumed at 25 degrees C was 0.7%, and this ratio was not altered by varying pH or CO2 concentration or by substituting Mn2+ for Mg2+ as the catalytically essential metal. The ratio increased with increasing temperature. Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylases from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 6301 and the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum also catalyzed pyruvate formation and to the same extent as the spinach enzyme. When the reaction was carried out in 2H2O, the spinach carboxylase increased the proportion of its product partitioned to pyruvate to 2.2%.

The sequence of the penultimate N-terminal tryptic peptide from the large subunit of the spinach and wheat enzyme was consistent with previous primary structure determinations. However, the penultimate N-terminal peptide from the large subunit of both the tobacco and muskmelon enzymes, while identical, differed from the corresponding peptide from spinach and wheat by containing a trimethyllysyl residue at position 14. Thus, tryptic proteolysis occurred at lysine-18 rather than lysine-14 as with the spinach and wheat enzymes.

3553187,"The existence in invertebrates, unicellular eukaryotes, and prokaryotes of materials that resemble several vertebrate peptide hormones led to the suggestion that these peptide messengers may have arisen earlier in evolution than had previously been thought. Consistent with this hypothesis, we describe here material in two plants, spinach and Lemma gibba G3, that is very similar to mammalian insulin, yet distinctive. In each of the early purification steps, which consisted of acidic methanol chloroform extraction and sequential chromatography on C-18 hydrophobic resin, Sephadex G-50, CM-Sepharose, and a short C-3 high performance liquid chromatography column, the immunoactive material from plants resembled the common vertebrate insulins. The protein nature of the material was suggested by its destruction by Pronase but not by the inactivated enzyme. In addition, on TSK chromatography it eluted in a position similar to that of insulin, i.e. equivalent to a protein of 6000 daltons. Using an isocratic high performance liquid chromatography system, the plant immunoactivity eluted earlier, and thus was more hydrophilic, than most of the common mammalian insulins, including pork insulin. The interaction of the plant material with anti-insulin antibodies in a radioimmunoassay was confirmed by using an affinity column of anti-insulin antibodies which adsorbed the plant immunoactivity at neutral pH, and released the material with acid elution. Using a quantitative double radioimmunoassay, the plant insulin-like material was distinguished immunologically from chicken insulin. Although the plant insulin-like material is clearly distinct from pork insulin chromatographically, and from chicken insulin immunologically, it resembles vertebrate insulins in its overall configuration. The plant insulin-like material bound to insulin receptors on IM-9 lymphocytes and stimulated glucose oxidation and lipogenesis in isolated adipocytes from young rats. The bioactivity was neutralized in the presence of anti-insulin antibodies, but not in the presence of normal guinea pig IgG. The role of this insulin-like material in plants is unknown but its existence is consistent with an early evolutionary origin of the insulin messenger peptide family. Alternatively we cannot exclude a later convergent development of this family or introduction of vertebrate DNA into plants.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D001681', 'D002460', 'D002851', 'D007328', 'D007330', 'D010944', 'D011402', 'D011863', 'D011972']","['Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Antibodies', 'Plants', 'Pronase', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Receptor, Insulin']",Partial purification and characterization of an insulin-like material from spinach and Lemna gibba G3.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000276', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'immunology', 'analysis', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3553187,1987

7174635,"The whole protein structure and the microenvironments of the iron-sulfur cluster and of the side chains of amino acid residues of spinach ferredoxin were studied by optical absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in the alkaline pH range. From the pH-dependence of the optical absorption changes at 245 nm, the four tyrosyl residues of ferredoxin were classified into three groups: one exposed residue with a normal apparent pK value of 10.1, two exposed residues with abnormal apparent pK values of 12.0, and one buried residue showing time-dependent ionization. The absorption in the visible region disappeared gradually with the ionization of the buried residue rather than that of the three exposed residues. The apparent pK value of 10.0 was obtained from the rapid CD changes at 258 nm caused by pH elevation from neutral to alkaline pH. The structural alteration associated with the CD change had no effect on the secondary structure of the protein moiety other than the iron-sulfur cluster and the microenvironment of the cluster. The rate constants obtained from the time courses of the CD changes in the near-ultraviolet and visible regions were in good agreement with those obtained from the time courses of the optical absorption changes. These results lead to the conclusions that (1) the native ferredoxin structure is maintained through the interaction with the iron-sulfur cluster and (2) the protein structure in the neighborhood of the cluster, important for the physiological activity, is not perturbed even though the exposed tyrosyl residues are ionized.",Journal of biochemistry,"['D002942', 'D005288', 'D006863', 'D010944', 'D013053', 'D013056']","['Circular Dichroism', 'Ferredoxins', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Plants', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",Analyses of optical absorption and circular dichroism spectra of spinach ferredoxin at alkaline pH.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7174635,1983

Comparison of dry and wet ashing showed good agreement for a variety of garden vegetables. Sample size was more strictly limited for the wet-ashed samples, which led to lower sensitivity. Vegetable samples are commonly analyzed for a number of trace elements, which introduces additional constraints on sample preparation, notably because of Cd loss on dry ashing. Pretreatment with HNO3/H2SO4 ash aid eliminated Cd loss. Reliability of dry ashing with pretreatment was shown with NBS SRM Orchard Leaves, Pine Needles, Spinach, and Tomato Leaves. The analysis was insensitive to ashing temperature in the range 480-625 degrees C. A practical detection limit for the method is about 2 ppm Pb, dry weight basis (DWB). Care must be exercised to avoid contamination of the sample with lead at this level by improper handling. Segregation and acid washing of glassware and protection of the sample from contact with any object not demonstrably clean was necessary. No evidence was found of Pb contamination at this level from tap water washing of fresh vegetables, forced-air oven drying, or grinding with mortar and pestle. No special clean room facilities or laboratory air purification measures were used. Sensitivity was increased 3-fold by extraction with dithizone in CHCl3 followed by back-extraction into dilute HCl.

A great similarity between the purified chloroplast polymerase and the mammalian mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma was found by several criteria: preference for the synthetic primer-template (dT)12-18 . poly(rA), optimal requirement for Mn2+ (0.1-1.0 mM), KCl (100 mM) and pH (8-9), high relative molecular mass (approximately 105,000), resistance to aphidicolin and inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide. Some peculiar features of the chloroplast DNA polymerase have, however, been noticed. The mammalian DNA polymerase gamma has been suggested to be responsible for the replication of mitochondrial DNA. Thus, both the presence of a gamma-like DNA polymerase in chloroplasts and the similarities between the chloroplast and the mitochondrial DNA (absence of a nucleosomal structure an presence of displacement loops) lead to the suggestion that chloroplast DNA is also replicated by a gamma-like DNA polymerase and that the gamma polymerases present in eukaryotes are, therefore, involved in a strand-displacement DNA synthesis.

A variety of hydride generation instruments were used, ranging from commercially available devices to semiautomated and fully automated custom-made instruments. Although the accuracy of the method was fairly good, between-laboratory and between-determination (hydride evolution AAS measurement) precisions were not favorable. The main advantage of the hydride AAS method is the rapidity of the determinative step.",Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,"['D001151', 'D005504', 'D012643', 'D013054']","['Arsenic', 'Food Analysis', 'Selenium', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']","Acid digestion, hydride evolution atomic absorption spectrophotometric method for determining arsenic and selenium in foods: collaborative study. tpart I.","['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/924947,1978

946795,"Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (HCBD), a waste product formed in the manufacture of perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene, has been found in fish from the lower Mississippi River basin. The AOAC official method for organochlorine pesticide residues in fatty and nonfatty foods has been modified for the determination of HCBD residues in selected food commodities. Acetonitrile extracts of nonfatty foods, or the combined acetonitrile extracts obtained in acetonitrile-petroleum ether partitioning of fat isolated from fatty foods, are diluted with water and extracted with petroleum ether. The petroleum ether extracts are chromatographed on Florisil and HCBD is eluted with petroleum ether. The elute is analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography with an electron capture detector. Average recoveries of HCBD from fortified samples of fatty and nonfatty foods were greater than 90% in the interlaboratory trials of the method.",Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,"['D000818', 'D002070', 'D002849', 'D004531', 'D005396', 'D005504', 'D007220', 'D008892', 'D014675']","['Animals', 'Butadienes', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Eggs', 'Fish Products', 'Food Analysis', 'Industrial Waste', 'Milk', 'Vegetables']","Determination of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene in spinach, eggs, fish, and milk by electron capture gas-liquid chromatography.","[None, 'Q000031', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/946795,1976
4463947,"1. Sulphate-dependent PP(i)-ATP exchange, catalysed by purified spinach leaf ATP sulphurylase, was correlated with the concentration of MgATP(2-) and MgP(2)O(7) (2-); ATP sulphurylase activity was not correlated with the concentration of free Mg(2+). 2. Sulphate-dependent PP(i)-ATP exchange was independent of PP(i) concentration, but dependent on the concentration of ATP and sulphate. The rate of sulphate-dependent PP(i)-ATP exchange was quantitatively defined by the rate equation applicable to the initial rate of a bireactant sequential mechanism under steady-state conditions. 3. Chlorate, nitrate and ADP inhibited the exchange reaction. The inhibition by chlorate and nitrate was uncompetitive with respect to ATP and competitive with respect to sulphate. The inhibition by ADP was competitive with respect to ATP and non-competitive with respect to sulphate. 4. ATP sulphurylase catalysed the synthesis of [(32)P]ATP from [(32)P]PP(i) and adenosine 5'-sulphatophosphate in the absence of sulphate; some properties of the reaction are described. Enzyme activity was dependent on the concentration of PP(i) and adenosine 5'-sulphatophosphate. 5. The synthesis of ATP from PP(i) and adenosine 5'-sulphatophosphate was inhibited by sulphate and ATP. The inhibition by sulphate was non-competitive with respect to PP(i) and adenosine 5'-sulphatophosphate; the inhibition by ATP was competitive with respect to adenosine 5'-sulphatophosphate and non-competitive with respect to PP(i). It was concluded that the reaction catalysed by spinach leaf ATP sulphurylase was ordered; expressing the order in the forward direction, MgATP(2-) was the first product to react with the enzyme and MgP(2)O(7) (2-) was the first product released. 6.

4177832,"Reaction of osmium tetroxide with isolated spinach chloroplasts fixed completely the glycolipids, phosphatidyl glycerol, and phosphatidyl choline. Under the same reaction conditions only 30% of the chlorophyll was fixed. Reaction of potassium permanganate with isolated spinach chloroplasts fixed more than 90% of the glycolipids, phosphatidyl glycerol, and phosphatidyl choline, provided the reaction period was long enough. Potassium permanganate also fixed the chlorophyll. Reaction of osmium tetroxide and potassium permanganate with isolated (14)C-lipids from Chlorella pyrenoidosa fixed 59% and 66% of the radioactivity, respectively. The lipids that were not fixed included sterols and pigments. Electron micrographs show that chloroplasts extracted with chloroform-methanol after fixation in osmium tetroxide or potassium permanganate differ from those dehydrated with acetone mainly in that in the former, osmiophilic globules have been removed and there seems to be some fusion of the boundary membranes and grana membranes.
