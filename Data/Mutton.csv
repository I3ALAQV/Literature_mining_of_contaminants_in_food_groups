34985214,"Chlorpropham is a plant growth regulator and a herbicide. It is commonly used in the post-harvest treatment of potato to inhibit germination. It can also be used for flower thinning and fruit thinning of fruit trees, and for controlling annual gramineous weeds and a few broad-leaved weeds. Improper or excessive use of chlorpropham in crop cultivation will affect the safety of animal-derived food and impair human health through the food chain and water cycle. Therefore, accurate quantification of chlorpropham is imperative for risk assessment and mitigating risks to food safety. A method based on solid phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS) was established for the determination of chlorpropham in animal-derived food. First, the pretreatment conditions were optimized. To purify the samples and remove impurities, SPE column cartridges with different packing materials such as PXC, PXA, Florisil, and PLS were investigated. Based on the retention of chlorpropham, the ProElut PLS SPE column was selected as the pretreatment purification column. The washing solution and eluents were then optimized. When water was used as the washing solution, chlorpropham remained adsorbed on the SPE column and was not eluted along with other water-soluble substances. When the proportion of acetonitrile exceeded 40%, chlorpropham adsorbed on the filler of the SPE column could be gradually washed down. Acetonitrile-water solution(30∶70, v/v) was used for washing the SPE column. The elution ability of seven eluents for chlorpropham on the SPE column was then investigated. Among them, pure methanol, pure acetonitrile, and 1% (v/v) formic acid-methanol showed better elution effect. Considering that acetonitrile was used in the sample extraction, it was chosen as the mobile phase eluent. Subsequently, the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters were optimized. By examining the ionization cracking of chlorpropham, the quasimolecular ions and corresponding fragmentations in the chlorpropham primary MS were determined. The separation effect of three C18 columns was investigated. Based on the retention ability and peak effect of chlorpropham on the column, the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) column was used for chlorpropham separation. The response of chlorpropham in the positive and negative ionization modes was investigated and optimized. The results showed that the response was better in the positive ion mode than that in the negative ion mode. After optimizing the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters, the sensitivity of the method was improved. Finally, the analytes were separated on the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) under a gradient elution program using acetonitrile and 0.2% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution as the mobile phases. The analytes were detected in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode under positive electrospray ionization (ESI",Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002748', 'D002851', 'D006801', 'D008892', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chlorpropham', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Milk', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",[Determination of chlorpropham residues in animal-derived foods by solid phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry].,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34985214,2022

However, few studies have examined the patterns of these elements and their determinants in pregnant or lactating women. Plasma samples of 1211 healthy mid-pregnant, late pregnant, and lactating women enrolled in coastland, lakeland, and inland areas of China from May-July 2014, were analyzed for concentrations of 15 elements, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The adjusted median concentrations of elements varied by physiologic stage and region. Lactating versus pregnant women showed higher concentrations of Zn, Cr, Mo, Ni, Sb, Cd and Pb, but lower concentrations of Cu, I, Al and Hg. In pregnant women, the concentrations of Fe, Zn, I, Mo, Ni, Al, Hg and Cd were higher in mid- versus late-pregnancy. Overall, the highest concentrations were observed in Zn, I, Mn, Al, and Pb in coastland, in Hg in lakeland, and in Fe in inland area. Element concentrations varied by maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, education, parity, delivery mode, feeding practice, and intakes of aquatic products and mutton.

33598948,"As a persistent organic pollutant, pentachlorophenol (PCP) has serious impacts on human health. However, its presence in animal source food products sold in the Guangdong Province (GD) of China, and the resultant dietary exposure have not been elucidated. To address this gap, 3,100 samples from seven food categories, including beef, pork, mutton, offals, broilers, hen eggs, and farmed freshwater fish, marketed throughout four geographical regions of GD, were collected from 2015 to 2018. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was employed to detect PCP levels in these food matrices. PCP was found in all food categories, but the average contamination levels were low, ranging from 0.40 µg/kg wet weight (ww) (hen eggs) to 5.85 µg/kg ww (offals). However, higher concentrations of PCP were detected (P < 0.05) in animal source food from the North region. Additionally, a temporal declining trend was observed in this four-year consecutive survey. The estimated human dietary exposure of PCP to population groups, including the general population and subgroups (male and female, children, and adults), was found to be far below the permissible daily intake (3 µg/kg body weight). Therefore, the health impacts of PCP should be correspondingly low for local residents, based on current toxicological knowledge. Regional exposure patterns varied due to different extents of contamination in the four areas, and pork, broilers, and freshwater fish were the major sources of dietary PCP exposure. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: As a persistent organic pollutant, pentachlorophenol (PCP) has serious impacts on human health. However, its presence in animal source food products sold in Guangdong Province of China, and the resultant dietary exposure have not been elucidated.

22789457,"4-Methyloctanoic acid (MOA) and 4-methylnonanoic acid (MNA) are the main compounds responsible for ""sweaty"" odor of mutton. A novel method for their determination has been developed and validated. Hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HF-SLM) was applied to selectively extract MOA and MNA prior to gas chromatography (GC) analysis. For HF-SLM, the donor outside the fiber was the acidified supernatant (pH 4) from aqueous mutton slurry. Liquid membrane was 5% tri-n-octylphoshphine oxide in di-n-hexyl ether and 0.3M NaOH aqueous solution filled in the lumen of the fiber was used as the acceptor. The extraction last for 4h. After acidification with HCl, the acceptor was directly analyzed by GC. Importantly, HF-SLM provided high enrichment factors for MOA (133) and MNA (116).

19253550,"A credible method was developed for the simultaneous determination of eleven steroid hormone residues in animal muscle tissues and eggs based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The eleven steroid hormones were testosterone, methyltestosterone, trenbolone, boldenone, nandrolone, methandienone, stanozolol, progesterone, nadrolone propionate, testosterone propionate and nadrolone phenylpropionate. The samples were extracted with tert-butyl methyl ether at alkaline pH and then cleaned up by freezing-lipid filtration. All these drugs can be assayed in 10 min by UPLC-MS/MS using electrospray ionization in positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring mode. The limits of detection were 0.3 microg/kg for testosterone, methyltestosterone, boldenone, methandienone and stanozolol, and 0.4 microg/kg for trenbolone nandrolone, progesterone, testosterone propionate and nadrolone phenylpropionate. Overall recoveries of testosterone, methyltestosterone, boldenone, methandienone and stanozolol were 62.3% - 105% from pork, beef, mutton and chicken muscle tissues, and eggs fortified at the 1, 2 and 10 microg/kg levels, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were 0.5% - 15%. The recoveries of trenbolone nandrolone, progesterone, testosterone propionate and nadrolone phenylpropionate were higher than 50.0%, and the RSDs were lower than 16%. The matrix calibration curve for each drug was linear (r > 0.99) from 1 to 100 microg/L.

The limit of detection (IC(15)) was 0.8 microg kg(-1) and the sensitivity (IC(50)) was 5.3 microg kg(-1). Three simple extraction methods were developed, including shaking on the rotary shaker at 250 r min(-1) overnight, shaking on the rotary shaker for 1 h and thoroughly mixing for 2 min. Methanol was used as the extraction solvent in this study. The extracts were diluted in 0.5% fish skin gelatin (FG) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at various dilutions in order to remove the matrix interference. For cabbage (purple and green), asparagus, Japanese green, Chinese cabbage, scallion, garland chrysanthemum, spinach and garlic, the extracts were diluted 10-fold; for carrots and tea, the extracts were diluted 15-fold and 900-fold, respectively. The extracts of celery, adzuki beans and chestnuts, were diluted 20-fold to avoid the matrix interference; ginger, vegetable soybean and peanut extracts were diluted 100-fold; mutton and chicken extracts were diluted 10-fold and for eel, the dilution was 40-fold. Average recoveries were 63.13-125.61%. Validation was conducted by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

Fresh samples were collected from 12-18 m old sheep slaughtered in abattoirs in Jordan in 2002. Besides, 40 fresh mutton samples of imported Chinese sheep were collected from different markets. Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was used to estimate the lead (Pb) content of the samples. Results indicated that Australian mutton had significantly higher (p < 0.05) mean of lead pollution than that of the local and Chinese muttons. The mean concentration of lead (mg/kg) in Australian, local and Chinese muttons was 4.30, 3.15 and 2.17, respectively. The mean concentration of lead in Australian sheep liver was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that recorded in the local sheep liver. The mean concentration of Pb in Australian and local sheep liver was 5.69 and 4.52 mg/kg, respectively. The mean concentrations of Pb in the kidney of the Australian and local sheep were not significantly different (p > 0.05). They were 4.59 and 3.87 mg/kg, respectively.

7517165,"The selenium concentration in foods grown and consumed and in plasma, red blood cells, and toenails of people living in the district of Chita in the transbaikalian part of Russia were studied in August 1991. Preliminary results from the area have suggested low selenium intakes and the possible occurrence of cardiomyopathy (Keshan disease) in the population. A low selenium concentration in foods grown locally was found: mean selenium concentration in wheat grains was 1, 5, and 28 micrograms/kg, respectively, in three villages studied, that of oats was between 3-6 micrograms/kg, and of cow's milk 10-27 micrograms/kg dry matter. The selenium concentration of bread was considerably higher, between 87-337 micrograms/kg dry wt, presumably because wheat imported from the US had been used for baking. Occasional samples of pork, beef, and mutton contained between 32-218 micrograms selenium/kg dry wt. Low selenium concentrations were observed in samples of soil and river water. The mean plasma selenium concentration of 52 persons was 1.02 mumol/L, including 33 children and 19 adult subjects. The selenium concentrations in red blood cells and toenails were 1.95 mumol/L and 0.61 mg/kg, respectively. No symptoms of heart disease caused by selenium deficiency were observed. It is concluded that the selenium status of people was fairly good thanks to the contribution to dietary intake of imported wheat with a high selenium content.

575906,"An outbreak of mortality in a flock of mutton merino sheep in which 109 out of 568 sheep died in the south-western Cape Province, is described. It was characterized by haemorrhagic septicaemia, anaemia, leucocytopaenia and haemorrhagic tendencies. Mortalities followed unseasonal and heavy summer rain, extended over a period of 6 months and were associated with the uninterrupted consumption of sheep cubes processed on the farm severly fungus-infested wheat, barley and rye straw for a period of at least one month. The main clinical signs occurred in two phases: an elevated body temperature, listlessness, epistaxis and intermittent haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first phase of the outbreak, and a progressively worsening anaemia, leucocytopaenia and less severe haemorrhagic tendencies and a terminally elevated body temperature during the second phase. The predominant autopsy findings were purpuric haemorrhage on serosal and mucosal surfaces and in most of the organs, enterorrhagia and severe pulmonary congestion and oedema during the first stage; anaemia was the predominant sign during the second stage - widespread haemorrhage still occurred but was less extensive. Pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from most of the animals autopsied during the first stage. Histologically the most salient features were atrophy and necrosis of the lymphoid tissue, aplastic anaemia and a markedly impaired inflammatory response. Extensive post-natal lamb mortalities, probably due to an Escherichia coli infection precipitated by the toxicosis, occurred during the outbreak. Toxigenic strains of Stachybotrys chartarum were isolated from the wheat and barley straw. Diethyl ether extracts of the wheat straw, sheep cubes and S. chartarum culture material elicited positive skin tests in rats following intradermal injection and the presence of 12,13-epoxytrichothecenes in these extracts were confirmed by thin layer chromatography. In feeding trials sheep cubes and wheat straw caused the death of 4/4 one-day-old Pekin ducklings and weanling Wistar rats in six and nine days, respectively.
