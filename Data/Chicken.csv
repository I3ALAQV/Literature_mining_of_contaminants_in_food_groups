35314979,"Carnosine is a naturally occurring dipeptide and a functional component in foods, while also showing health-promoting effects. Generally, food-derived carnosine is quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We have developed a method for quantifying carnosine in foods using microbial enzymes, β-Ala-Xaa dipeptidase (BapA) and histidine ammonia-lyase (HAL). The carnosine concentrations in extracts of chicken, pork, beef, bonito, and tuna were determined via both HPLC and enzymatic determination. The carnosine contents measured via enzymatic determination were in agreement with those determined via conventional HPLC analysis. Relative standard-deviation values of the conventional HPLC method and the enzymatic determination of carnosine in foods were 0.728-5.76% and 0.504-4.58%, respectively. The recovery of carnosine in food extracts via enzymatic determination was 97-103%. Therefore, the developed enzymatic determination technique using BapA and HAL can be used for the determination of carnosine in meats and fishes with comparable accuracy to that of conventional HPLC analysis.",Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002336', 'D002417', 'D004150', 'D005399', 'D006638', 'D008460', 'D016958']","['Animals', 'Carnosine', 'Cattle', 'Dipeptidases', 'Fishes', 'Histidine Ammonia-Lyase', 'Meat', 'Pseudomonas putida']",Enzymatic determination of carnosine in meat and fish using β-Ala-Xaa dipeptidase and histidine ammonia-lyase derived from Pseudomonas putida NBRC100650.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35314979,2022

35030475,"The objective of this work was to develop a quantitative multi-residue method for analysing antiviral drug residues and their metabolites in poultry meat samples. Antiviral drugs are not licensed for the treatment of influenza in food producing animals. However, there have been some reports indicating their illegal use in poultry. In this study, a method was developed for the analysis of 15 antiviral drug residues in poultry muscle (chicken, duck, quail and turkey) using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This included 13 drugs against influenza and associated metabolites, but also two drugs employed for the treatment of herpes (acyclovir and ganciclovir). The method required the development of a novel chromatographic separation using a hydrophilic interaction chromatographic (HILIC) BEH amide column, which was necessary to retain the highly polar compounds. The analytes were detected using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in positive electrospray ionization mode. A range of different sample preparation protocols suitable for polar compounds were evaluated. The most effective procedure was based on a simple acetonitrile-based protein precipitation step followed by a further dilution in a methanol/water solution. The confirmatory method was validated according to the EU 2021/808 guidelines on different species including chicken, duck, turkey and quail. The validation was performed using various calibration curves ranging from 0.1 µg kg",Journal of chromatography.

34985214,"Chlorpropham is a plant growth regulator and a herbicide. It is commonly used in the post-harvest treatment of potato to inhibit germination. It can also be used for flower thinning and fruit thinning of fruit trees, and for controlling annual gramineous weeds and a few broad-leaved weeds. Improper or excessive use of chlorpropham in crop cultivation will affect the safety of animal-derived food and impair human health through the food chain and water cycle. Therefore, accurate quantification of chlorpropham is imperative for risk assessment and mitigating risks to food safety. A method based on solid phase extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS) was established for the determination of chlorpropham in animal-derived food. First, the pretreatment conditions were optimized. To purify the samples and remove impurities, SPE column cartridges with different packing materials such as PXC, PXA, Florisil, and PLS were investigated. Based on the retention of chlorpropham, the ProElut PLS SPE column was selected as the pretreatment purification column. The washing solution and eluents were then optimized. When water was used as the washing solution, chlorpropham remained adsorbed on the SPE column and was not eluted along with other water-soluble substances. When the proportion of acetonitrile exceeded 40%, chlorpropham adsorbed on the filler of the SPE column could be gradually washed down. Acetonitrile-water solution(30∶70, v/v) was used for washing the SPE column. The elution ability of seven eluents for chlorpropham on the SPE column was then investigated. Among them, pure methanol, pure acetonitrile, and 1% (v/v) formic acid-methanol showed better elution effect. Considering that acetonitrile was used in the sample extraction, it was chosen as the mobile phase eluent. Subsequently, the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters were optimized. By examining the ionization cracking of chlorpropham, the quasimolecular ions and corresponding fragmentations in the chlorpropham primary MS were determined. The separation effect of three C18 columns was investigated. Based on the retention ability and peak effect of chlorpropham on the column, the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) column was used for chlorpropham separation. The response of chlorpropham in the positive and negative ionization modes was investigated and optimized. The results showed that the response was better in the positive ion mode than that in the negative ion mode. After optimizing the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters, the sensitivity of the method was improved. Finally, the analytes were separated on the Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 (150 mm×2.1 mm, 5 μm) under a gradient elution program using acetonitrile and 0.2% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution as the mobile phases.

A broad-spectrum monoclonal antibody (mAb, named 14C6) was prepared and conjugated with carboxylic-acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles using the active ester method to obtain IMBs for sample purification. The extraction solvent was optimized based on the extraction efficiency. Good linearity was observed for all the five analytes (10-200 μg/kg) with the LOD and LOQ of 5 and 10 μg/kg, respectively. The mean recoveries ranged from 62.5% to 76.9%, while the coefficient of variation was <12.2%.

34859904,"The characterization and functionality of protein glycosylation among different related species are of common interest. Herein, non-standard quantification and N-glycosylation enrichment technology combined with ultra-high liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to establish detailed N-glycoproteomics of fertilized eggs, and quantitatively compared between Tibetan and lowland chicken. A total of 396N-glycosites from 143 glycoproteins were found. Specifically, compared with lowland chicken egg white, 32N-glycosites of 22 glycoproteins were up-regulated and 57N-glycosites of 25 glycoproteins were down-regulated in Tibetan chicken egg white. Also, 137N-glycosites in 72 glycoproteins showed much higher-degree glycosylation and 36N-glycosites in 15 glycoproteins displayed lower-degree glycosylation in Tibetan chicken egg yolk than those in lowland chicken egg yolk. Through bioinformatic analysis, these varied glycoproteins were highly associated with antifreeze activity, hypoxia adaptation, coagulation cascade, and binding/immunity activities, which may be related to plateau hypoxia and cold stress.

34677016,"As among the most widely used pesticides in agriculture, plant growth regulators (PGRs) have a positive influence on plants. However, the overuse of PGRs may induce toxicity in food and even be hazardous to human health. Numerous studies have investigated the presence and residues of PGRs on vegetables and fruits. Animal-derived foods are one of the most dominant food sources providing nutrients to fulfil the daily dietary intake, and could also be potentially contaminated by PGRs. However, there is little information on PGR residues in animal-derived foods. Standardization also lacks among the techniques for PGR determination in animal-derived foods, thereby restricting the further establishment of pesticide usage and food safety regulations. Therefore, in this study, a rapid and effective method for analyzing chlormequat chloride, thidiazuron, and paclobutrazol in animal-derived food samples was established. The method primarily involves high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with the use of isotope-labeled internal standards.

34266369,"The selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) clomiphene is therapeutically used to induce ovulation. While prohibited as a doping agent in sports, it is frequently detected in sports drug testing urine samples. Few reports exist on clomiphene's (illicit) use in the farming industry to increase the egg production rate of laying hens, which creates a risk that eggs as well as edible tissue of these hens contain residues of clomiphene. To investigate the potential transfer of clomiphene into eggs and muscle tissue, laying hens were orally administered with clomiphene citrate at 10 mg/day for 28 days. To determine clomiphene residues in eggs, chicken breast and chicken thigh, the target analyte was extracted from homogenised material with acetonitrile and subjected to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The test method reached a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 µg/kg and was characterised concerning specificity, precision, trueness and linearity. Analyses were performed on whole egg, egg white and yolk separately, and chicken muscle from breast and thigh. Clomiphene was detectable in eggs two days after the beginning of the drug administration period. The drug concentrations increased to 10-20 µg per egg within one week, and after withdrawal of clomiphene, residues decreased after 4 days, but traces of clomiphene were still detectable until the end of the study (14 days after the last administration). In the chicken's muscle tissue, clomiphene levels up to 150 µg/kg (thigh) and 36 µg/kg (breast) were found. Six days after the last dose, tissue clomiphene concentrations fell below the LOQ. Overall, these results underline the concerns that clomiphene may be transferred into animal-derived food and future research will therefore need to focus on assessing and minimising the risk of unintentional adverse analytical findings in doping controls.","Food additives & contaminants.

They are valorised by their transformation into feather meal in order to be used as fertilisers in agriculture but also in animal feed (in particular, pet food and fish feed). However, unlike food producing animals for humans, feathers from poultry animals are not subject to a ban or regulatory limits on the presence of antibiotic residue after veterinary treatment. Feathers could therefore be a potential reservoir of antibiotic residues, unintentionally exposing the environment and animals through food, which might contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. To this end, a multi-class liquid chromatographic method coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed for the detection and determination of residues of 30 antibiotics from eight groups of antibacterial (quinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, penicillins, phenicols, tetracyclines, sulphonamides and diaminopyrimidines) in feathers. The extraction of the analytes from the feathers was carried out by the salting out technique. The separation of the analytes employed a Kinetex C18 column.

Biosensing methods have shown great potential for the rapid detection of foodborne pathogens. Some of the biosensors are based on fluorescence. Various fluorophores such as collagen, elastin, NAD(P)H, and porphyrins can be used to evaluate possible chemical changes in meat. In this manuscript, the fluorescence properties of chicken meat contaminated with Salmonella enterica (ATCC 14028) cell suspensions (500; 5000; 50,000 and 500,000 cells/mL) were obtained and compared with non-contaminated control, for meat kept at 25 °C for 24 and 48 h. The effects of ambient light were also considered. Our results indicated that free NAD(P)H and coproporphyrin emission bands present in contaminated meat, increased over time, and can provide access to valuable information for the detection of Salmonella in chicken meat.","Spectrochimica acta.

33963436,"Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is one of the most powerful tools for the multiclass, multiresidue analysis of veterinary drugs, pesticides, mycotoxins, and other chemical contaminants in foods and other sample types. Until approximately 2010, commercial MS/MS instruments using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) were generally limited to minimum dwell (and inter-dwell) times of 10 ms per ion transition. To achieve the needed accuracy and detection limits for hundreds of targeted analytes, older UHPLC-MS/MS methods typically acquired only two ion transitions per analyte (yielding only one ion ratio for qualitative identification purposes), which is still the norm despite technological advancements. Newer instruments permit as little as 1 ms (inter-)dwell times to afford monitoring of more MRMs/analyte with minimal sacrifices in accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, quantification and identification were assessed in the validation of 169 veterinary drugs in liquid and powdered eggs. Quantitatively, an ""extract-and-inject"" sample preparation method yielded acceptable 70-120% recoveries and < 25% RSD for 139-141 (82-83%) of the 169 diverse drug analytes spiked into powdered and liquid eggs, respectively, at three levels of regulatory interest. Qualitatively, rates of false positives and negatives were compared when applying three different regulatory identification criteria in which two or three MRMs/drug were used in each case. Independent of the identification criteria, rates of false positives remained <10% for 95-99% of the drugs whether 2 or 3 ions were monitored, but the percent of drugs with >10% false negatives decreased from 25-45 to 10-12% when using 2 vs. 3 MRMs/analyte, respectively. Use of a concentration threshold at 10% of the regulatory level as an identification criterion was also very useful to reduce rates of false positives independent of ion ratios. Based on these results, monitoring >2 ion transitions per analyte is advised when using MS/MS for analysis, independent of SANTE/12682/2019, FDA/USDA, or 2002/657/EC identification criteria. (Quant)identification results using all three criteria were similar, but the SANTE criteria were advantageous in their greater simplicity and practical ease of use.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D004350', 'D004531', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D053719', 'D019155']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Drug Residues', 'Eggs', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Veterinary Drugs']",Comparison of analyte identification criteria and other aspects in triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry: Case study using UHPLC-MS/MS for regulatory analysis of veterinary drug residues in liquid and powdered eggs.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963436,2022

The present study was carried out to assess the heavy metal residues such as Pb, Cd, As and Hg in broiler chicken meat, neck and edible organs (liver and kidney). In the present study, 150 samples were randomly collected from major cities (Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Trichy, and Salem) of Tamil Nadu state, India and analyzed for Pb, Cd, As and Hg residues (mg/kg) using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique. The results revealed that lead (Pb) concentration was higher in meat and liver samples of all cities and the highest concentration was detected in Chennai followed by Coimbatore, whereas in kidney and neck samples, Chennai metropolitan alone exceeded the MRL value of 0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg respectively. The residues of cadmium and mercury in meat and meat samples were within the permissible limit in all the metropolitans. Arsenic was found exceeding the MRL of 0.1 mg/kg in the breast samples of all the metropolitans (0.2141-2.2285 mg/kg, the highest being in Trichy), except for Madurai, which recorded very low value (0.0239 mg/kg). Arsenic was found in the range of 0.1110-1.0850 mg/kg in liver samples thus exceeding MRL value. Neck and kidney samples did not contain any Arsenic. Thus it can be concluded that the lead concentration in meat and edible organ samples collected from all the metropolitans exceeded the MRL values and is an indication of contamination.

33207646,"Citrinin (CIT) is a polyketide mycotoxin occurring in a variety of food and feedstuff, among which cereal grains are the most important contaminated source. Pigs and poultry are important livestock animals frequently exposed to mycotoxins, including CIT. Concerns are rising related to the toxic, and especially the potential nephrotoxic, properties of CIT. The purpose of this study was to clarify the histopathological effects on kidneys, liver, jejunum and duodenum of pigs, broiler chickens and laying hens receiving CIT contaminated feed. During 3 weeks, pigs (n = 16) were exposed to feed containing 1 mg CIT/kg feed or to control feed (n = 4), while 2 groups of broiler chickens and laying hens (n = 8 per group) received 0.1 mg CIT/kg feed (lower dose group) and 3 or 3.5 mg CIT/kg feed (higher dose group), respectively, or control feed (n = 4). CIT concentrations were quantified in plasma, kidneys, liver, muscle and eggs using a validated ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method. Kidneys, liver, duodenum and jejunum were evaluated histologically using light microscopy, while the kidneys were further examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Histopathology did not reveal major abnormalities at the given contamination levels. However, a significant increase of swollen and degenerated mitochondria in renal cortical cells from all test groups were observed (p < 0.05). These observations could be related to oxidative stress, which is the major mechanism of CIT toxicity. Residues of CIT were detected in all collected tissues, except for muscle and egg white from layers in the lowest dose group, and egg white from layers in the highest dose group. CIT concentrations in plasma ranged between 0.1 (laying hens in lower dose group) and 20.8 ng/mL (pigs). In tissues, CIT concentrations ranged from 0.6 (muscle) to 20.3 µg/kg (liver) in pigs, while concentrations in chickens ranged from 0.1 (muscle) to 70.2 µg/kg (liver).

It has been demonstrated that the leaching that occurs when the foods are cooked by wrapping them in Al foil is not negligible and that the consumption of these foods, together with the consumption of other foodstuffs, such as, for example, some vegetables that may naturally contain aluminum, can lead to consuming a weekly dose not far from the TWI (tolerable weekly intake).",International journal of environmental research and public health,"['D000535', 'D000818', 'D003296', 'D005399', 'D008460', 'D013052']","['Aluminum', 'Animals', 'Cooking', 'Fishes', 'Meat', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission']",Quantification of the Aluminum Content Leached into Foods Baked Using Aluminum Foil.,"['Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198078,2021

It was also verify whether generated changes would make the giblets and wastes more valuable as dietary components or by-products for food industry. From 22 to 42 day of life, five diets were administered to chickens. Control grower diet (CON) contained 5% of soy oil, whereas in the experimental grower diets part of soy oil (1.5% or 2%) was replaced with specific amount of grape or pomegranate seed oil (GRAP 1.5; GRAP 2.0; POM 1.5; POM 2.0 respectively). Fatty acids and cholesterol content were determined with gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection. Pomegranate seed oil improved fatty acids profile more favourably than grape seed oil, which makes it a valuable additive in chickens' feeding.

The glycation sites were determined, and their average degree of substitution was found using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Fluctuations in OVA conformation were monitored by conventional spectrometry. Compared to those of OVA-Man and OVA-Glu, OVA-All, OVA-Gal, and OVA-Ido showed a higher glycation extent, and the alterations on their steric layouts were more drastic, suggesting that the configuration of hydroxyl groups at positions C-3, C-4, and C-5 in sugars might be important for the glycation reactivity; as such, their capabilities in binding with IgG/IgE decreased more significantly.

Residues of salicylic acid in tissues and eggs may occur after drug administration or exposure of animals to feed material with high salicylate content. An animal study was performed on laying hens. The birds received sodium salicylate or acetylsalicylic acid (10 mg/kg b.w.) for 7 days or were given corn containing 1.18 mg/kg of salicylic acid. Samples of liver, muscle and plasma were collected at 0, 4, 8, 24 and 72 h after treatment; eggs were collected daily for 14 days. Salicylic acid and its metabolites: gentisic acid, salicyluric acid and gentisuric acid were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. In both liver and muscle, the residues after administration of sodium salicylate were initially higher than for acetylsalicylic acid but they depleted at the same time. The deposition and depletion profile of salicylic acid in eggs was similar for groups receiving both drugs; the plateau level reached 248 ± 61.5 μg/kg and 275 ± 82.1 μg/kg. The concentration of salicylic acid in tissues and eggs of animals receiving salicylic acid was low. Gentisic acid was found in individual samples of liver, muscle and eggs from all treated groups. The exposure of hens to the salicylates at feed additive levels and to naturally occurring salicylates results in low residue concentrations and fast depletion of salicylic acid. The eggs do not pose any risk to consumers sensitive to salicylates.","Food additives & contaminants.

Broilers were then fed with a mix of moldy corn and normal feed at different ratios to obtain different toxin doses. After 35 days, the contaminated feed was replaced with mycotoxin-free feed and the distribution and concentration of residual toxins in the tissues and organs of the chickens were examined at different time points. The results showed that at the time of feed replacement (0 h), T-2 residue was present at significantly higher concentrations in the lungs and small intestines than in other tissues (P < 0.05). In addition, T-2 concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner in the tissues of chickens in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups; however, the differences in concentration between the groups were not statistically significant. The HT-2 content (0 h) in the livers and small intestines was significantly higher than that in other tissues (P < 0.05). At 48 h post-feed replacement, the concentration of T-2 dropped below detectable levels in all tissues while HT-2 could still be detected at 192 h post-feed replacement.

32134068,"The most significant cost driver for efficient bio-production of edible animal proteins is the cell culture media, where growth factors account for up to 96% of the total cost. The culture media must be serum-free, affordable, contain only food-grade ingredients, be efficient to promote cell growth and available in massive quantities. The commercially available serum substitutes are expensive and not necessarily food-grade. Identifying inexpensive food-safe alternatives to serum is crucial. By-products from food production are available in massive quantities, contain potential factors that can promote growth and are promising ingredients for serum replacement. The main goal of this study was to explore if food-grade by-product materials can be used as growth promoting agents in skeletal muscle cell culture to develop a tailor-made serum free media. Different by-products, including chicken carcass, cod backbone, eggshell membrane, egg white powder and pork plasma were enzymatically or chemically hydrolyzed. The hydrolysates in addition to lyophilized pork plasma and yeast extract were further characterized by size-exclusion chromatography, elemental combustion analysis and degree of hydrolysis. The materials were used as supplement to or replacement of commercial serum and further evaluated for their effect on metabolic activity, cell proliferation and cell cytotoxicity in muscle cells cultured in vitro. Our results indicate that none of the materials were cytotoxic to the skeletal muscle cells. Hydrolysates rich in peptides with approximately 2-15 amino acids in length were shown to improve cell growth and metabolic activity. Of all the materials tested pork plasma hydrolysates and yeast extract were the most promising. Pork plasma hydrolysates increased metabolic activity by 110% and cell proliferation with 48% when cultured in serum-free conditions for 3 days compared with control cells cultured with full serum conditions. Most interestingly, this response was dependent on both material and choice of enzyme used.

Two formats of immunochromatographic analysis (ICA) based on different approaches of introducing gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as a label were compared. It was demonstrated that an indirect ICA method where GNPs were conjugated with anti-species antibodies allowed the achievement of both instrumental and visual detection limits of LIN almost two orders of magnitude lower than those achieved in the standard direct ICA format. In the optimized conditions, the developed indirect ICA allowed for the detection of LIN within 15 min, with instrumental and visual detection limits of 8 pg/mL and 0.8 ng/mL. The assay showed 40% cross-reactivity to clindamycin (CLIN) as a structural analogue of LIN, with no interaction with antibiotics from other classes. The developed ICA was applied for LIN detection in a panel of food products. No treatment of cow milk was necessary before the analysis. For chicken eggs and honey, a simple procedure of preliminary sample preparation was developed, which fully prevented a matrix influence on the assay results. It was demonstrated that ICA could detect LIN in food products while preserving the same analytical characteristics as in the buffer.

Four laboratories, 1 principal laboratory and 3 collaborating laboratories, conducted instrument comparison (limit of detection [LOD], limit of quantification [LOQ], and linear dynamic range [LDR] on 24 data sets), in-house method comparison (accuracy and precision on 120 data sets), and interlaboratory comparison (reproducibility on 528 data sets using Horwitz equation analysis). Matrices tested included 2 types of pet food jerky treats (chicken and sweet potato), bovine blood, and bovine liver and kidney. The instrument comparison study confirmed that ICP-MS provided the sensitivity necessary for the analysis of all heavy metals tested at concentrations below the level of concern for routine diagnostic testing. The ""in-house"" method comparison samples, spiked at low (0.04 µg/g), medium (0.4 µg/g), and high (8.0 µg/g; note: the high validation level spike for mercury was 2 µg/g) concentration levels, indicated that ICP-MS can meet U.S. FDA acceptance criteria for both accuracy (90-105% recovery) and precision (< 6% coefficient of variation). The interlaboratory comparison studies showed that ICP-MS is a reproducible method for the analysis of heavy metals (HorRat value of 0.5-2.0) except for mercury in one laboratory, which used a different sample preparation method (open block rather than microwave digestion). Overall, our study showed that ICP-MS is a reproducible method for the analysis of heavy metals in spite of minor differences in methodology.","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc","['D000821', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D007668', 'D008099', 'D013058', 'D019216']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metals, Heavy']",Interlaboratory comparison of heavy metal testing in animal diagnostic specimens and feed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000662', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'blood', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'veterinary', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32052705,2020

Animals are raised for meat, eggs and for ornamental purpose, and they are often fed with home-made diets not subject to official controls. The purpose of this study was to evaluate exposure of ornamental and backyard chickens to OTA using biliary ochratoxin A as a biomarker. Therefore, bile samples, in addition to kidney, liver and muscle, were collected from 102 chickens reared in 16 farms located in 6 Italian regions. High-performance liquid chromatography method and fluorimetric detection (HPLC-FLD) analysis were carried out firstly on bile from all animals, and OTA was detected in 12 chickens (concentration range 3.83-170.42 µg/L). Subsequently, the kidneys of these chickens were also analysed, and the mycotoxin was not detected. The analytical detection limits (LODs) of OTA in bile and kidney were 2.1 µg/L and 0.1 µg/kg, respectively. In conclusion, these animals were exposed to OTA but their meat can be considered safe, given that this mycotoxin, if present, concentrates highest in kidneys.

The gastrointestinal stability of ZnONPs was also evaluated. The idea behind this study is to track for first time the transformations underwent of nanoparticles in the different steps of their route from packaging to the consumer. The presence of high amount of dissolved zinc in the samples notably influenced size detection limit and the accuracy of SP-ICP-MS measurements. The diameter limits of detection (LODd) were 26 nm, 95 nm, 108 nm and 129 nm for aqueous solution, chicken breast extract and for oral and intestinal extracts, respectively. ZnONPs characterization in juice was not possible with SP-ICP-MS due to nanoparticles size was below LODd. Besides difficulties, SP-ICP-MS after extraction with Tris-HCl allowed us to determine that a 72% of the ZnONPs that migrated to chicken breast were smaller than 95 nm. Complementary to SP-ICP-MS, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enabled to detect small nanoparticles (<3 nm). The combination of TEM and SP-ICP-MS measurements indicated that nanoparticles in chicken reach the intestine wall as small particles (<10 nm), as aggregates (>200 nm) and as ionic zinc whereas in case of juice only small nanoparticles (<3 nm) and ionic zinc were detected in the intestinal step.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D032084', 'D018857', 'D000067030', 'D005766', 'D041981', 'D013058', 'D008460', 'D053758', 'D010316', 'D013499', 'D015034']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Food Packaging', 'Fruit and Vegetable Juices', 'Gastrointestinal Contents', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Meat', 'Nanoparticles', 'Particle Size', 'Surface Properties', 'Zinc Oxide']",Using single-particle ICP-MS for unravelling the effect of type of food on the physicochemical properties and gastrointestinal stability of ZnONPs released from packaging materials.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31987132,2020
31978716,"The development of a sensitive and rapid detection approach for allergens in various food matrices is essential to assist patients in managing their allergies. The most common methods used for allergen detection are based on immunoassays, PCR and mass spectrometry. However, all of them are very complex and time-consuming. Herein, an aptamer biosensor for the detection of the major shrimp allergen tropomyosin (TM) was developed. Graphene oxide (GO) was used as a platform for screening of the minimal-length aptamer sequence required for high-affinity target binding. A fluorescein dye labeled GO quenches the truncated aptamer by π-stacking interactions. After the addition of TM, the fluorescence was restored due to the competitive binding of the aptamer to GO. One of the truncated aptamers was found to bind to TM with four-fold higher affinity (30 nM) compared to the full-length aptamer (124 nM), with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2 nM. The aptamer-based sensor demonstrates the sensitive, selective, and specific detection of TM in 30 min. The performance of the sensor was confirmed using TM spiked chicken soup, resulting in a high percentage recovery (~97 ± 10%).

Therefore, CTC-COF@MCNT was applied as adsorbent for magnetic solid-phase extraction to enrich the heterocyclic aromatic amines from complex food samples prior to the determination by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The adsorption mechanism between CTC-COF@MCNT and heterocyclic aromatic amines was discussed and verified by Gaussian simulation. The effect of adsorbent amount, extraction conditions and desorption conditions on the efficiency of pretreatment were optimized.

31931892,"Brominated flame retardants (BFR) are primarily used as flame retardant additives in insulating materials. These lipophilic compounds can bioaccumulate in animal tissues, leading to human exposure via food ingestion. Although their concentration in food is not yet regulated, several of these products are recognised as persistent organic pollutants; they are thought to act as endocrine disruptors. The present study aimed to characterise the occurrence of two families of BFRs (hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)) in hen eggs and broiler or pig meat in relation to their rearing environments. Epidemiological studies were carried out on 60 hen egg farms (34 without an open-air range, 26 free-range), 57 broiler farms (27 without an open-air range, 30 free-range) and 42 pig farms without an open-air range in France from 2013 to 2015. For each farm, composite samples from either 12 eggs, five broiler pectoral muscles or three pig tenderloins were obtained. Eight PBDE congeners and three HBCDD stereoisomers were quantified in product fat using gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, or high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The frequencies of PBDE detection were 28% for eggs (median concentration 0.278 ng/g fat), 72% for broiler muscle (0.392 ng/g fat) and 49% for pig muscle (0.403 ng/g fat). At least one HBCDD stereoisomer was detected in 17% of eggs (0.526 ng/g fat), 46% of broiler muscle (0.799 ng/g fat) and 36% of pig muscle (0.616 ng/g fat). Results were similar in concentration to those obtained in French surveillance surveys from 2012 to 2016. Nevertheless, the contamination of free-range eggs and broilers was found to be more frequent than that of conventional ones, suggesting that access to an open-air range could be an additional source of exposure to BFRs for animals. However, the concentration of BFRs in all products remained generally very low. No direct relationship could be established between the occurrence of BFRs in eggs and meat and the characteristics of farm buildings (age, building materials). The potential presence of BFRs in insulating materials is not likely to constitute a significant source of animal exposure as long as the animals do not have direct access to these materials.",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,"['D000383', 'D000818', 'D002645', 'D004784', 'D004785', 'D000072480', 'D005411', 'D005602', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D008460', 'D013552']","['Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Farms', 'Flame Retardants', 'France', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Meat', 'Swine']",Do farming conditions influence brominated flame retardant levels in pig and poultry products?,"[None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931892,2020

The egg is considered to be an excellent food provided by nature. It is a good source of nutrients such as vitamins A, B2, B6, B12, D, E and K, as well as elements including phosphorus, selenium, iron, zinc, magnesium and calcium. The research material use in this study consisted of eggs from hens kept in two different systems: organic and battery cages.

The content of elements was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) using an AA280 FS spectrometer with the automatic dilution of standards and samples. The eggs from the organically raised hens had a higher calcium, magnesium and zinc content. The greater variation in the Ca, Mg and Zn content in the organic eggs is due to the more individualized feeding system. The rearing system of the hens significantly affects the concentration of elements in the egg. The results of this research indicate that eggs from organic farming systems have a richer chemical composition in terms of the content of nutrients such as calcium, magnesium and zinc compared with eggs obtained from caged hens.

In 2017, fipronil was involved in a European health alert due to its presence in fresh hen eggs because of an illicit use in poultry farms, so reliable methods are needed to determine fipronil and its main metabolites in these matrixes. In this work, we report the first approach to the study of fipronil and two metabolites, fipronil-sulfone and fipronil-sulfide by CE. MEKC mode was employed using a solution of 50 mM ammonium perfluorooctanoate pH 9.0 with 10% (v/v) methanol as background electrolyte. The proposed method was combined with a simple sample treatment based on salting-out assisted LLE (SALLE) using acetonitrile as extraction solvent and ammonium sulfate as salt.

31767906,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a synthetic chemical ubiquitous in the environment and listed as an endocrine disruptor. It has the tendency of migrating into food stored in materials containing it. This study, therefore, determines the concentrations of BPA in foods commonly consumed in Southwest Nigeria by the adult population and also estimates the risk associated with human exposure. Eight different food categories were selected for this study. Standard QuEChERS protocol was used for sample extraction and analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Vegetable oil had the highest BPA concentration (28.4 ng/g). This was followed by aquatic canned fish (26.3 ng/g), canned beef (21.3 ng/g) and crayfish (17.5 ng/g). These concentrations were below the 600 ng/g limit of the European Commission for BPA in foods. Bisphenol-A was not detected in raw beef, chicken, cheese, apple, tomatoes, beans and rice; and chicken eggs. The adult population had an average dietary intake of 30.4 ng/kg bw/day.

31750947,"The abuse of pesticides in home gardens may lead to contamination of home-grown eggs. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), aldrin, and malathion pesticides residues in egg white and egg yolk of home-grown eggs in Jordan; and the effect of refrigerated storage and heat treatment (boiling and frying) on residues level. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to detect pesticide residues in egg samples (n = 200) obtained from households that raise laying hens in Jordan. About 96% of the tested eggs showed pesticide residues. None of the tested egg samples showed residual level above maximum residue limit (MRL 0.02 mg/kg) for HCH, whereas 33% and 44% of samples were above MRL for aldrin and malathion, respectively. All studied pesticide residues were detected from both egg yolk and egg white. The concentrations of malathion and aldrin (0.075 and 0.067 mg/kg) in egg yolk were higher than those (0.049 and 0.058 mg/kg) in egg white samples. Pesticide residue levels were quite stable during refrigeration storage whereas heat treatment (boiling at 100 °C and frying at 160 °C) significantly reduced contamination levels to values below MRL. The high level of pesticide residues in home-grown egg in Jordan may reflect the improper use of pesticides in home gardens and thus exposing the environment to unwanted pollution and the risk they may pose on human health. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Home-grown eggs could be exposed to pesticides more than commercial eggs as free-range hens interact directly with the environment and ingest soil or materials on/in the soil that might be contaminated with pesticides used in home gardens or farms. Exploring pesticides residues in home-grown eggs and effect of refrigerated storage and heat treatment (boiling and frying) on residue levels would be useful to consumers and health authorities.",Journal of food science,"['D000452', 'D000818', 'D002645', 'D003296', 'D004529', 'D004530', 'D004531', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D061353', 'D001556', 'D006358', 'D007597', 'D008294', 'D010573']","['Aldrin', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Cooking', 'Egg White', 'Egg Yolk', 'Eggs', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Storage', 'Hexachlorocyclohexane', 'Hot Temperature', 'Jordan', 'Malathion', 'Pesticide Residues']","Pesticides (Hexachlorocyclohexane, Aldrin, and Malathion) Residues in Home-Grown Eggs: Prevalence, Distribution, and Effect of Storage and Heat Treatments.","['Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31750947,2020

31524951,"In the present study, we analyzed the tilmicosin residues in eggs as well as the dietary risks posed by the residual drug to Chinese consumers. Tilmicosin was administrated to laying hens via drinking water in doses of 100 mg/L and 300 mg/L (dose 1 and dose 2) for 5 days. Its residues distribution within egg matrices were detected using a QuEChERS method coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results indicated that the tilmicosin residue was the highest in the whole eggs and yolks on day 2 after medication and in the whites on day 5 of drug administration for dose 1 and dose 2 with the residues (µg/kg) being the following: 73.4 and 444.3 in the whole eggs; 152.0 and 1141.1 in the yolks; and 48.8 and 277.6 in the whites, respectively. During withdrawal phase, the tilmicosin levels declined to less than the limit of detection (LOD) after 29 days and 49 days for the whole eggs, after 24 days and 44 days for the yolks, and after 19 days and 49 days for the whites for doses 1 and 2, respectively. An assessment of the dietary risk for Chinese consumers revealed that the hazard quotients (HQ) values for tilmicosin consumption were less than 1 for dose 1 and greater than 1 for dose 2, with children (2 to 7 years) and adult males (over 65 years) being the high-risk groups. These results suggest that the possible risk associated with tilmicosin contamination in eggs should not be ignored since the accidental or occasional misuse of tilmicosin in the case of egg-laying hens may occur from time to time, particularly on small farms.

We present sets of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, which turned out to be the source of 105 heat-stable peptides, detectable in processed meat using LC-MS/MS. A list of heat-stable species-specific peptides was compiled for eleven types of white and red meat including chicken, duck, goose, turkey, pork, beef, lamb, rabbit, buffalo, deer, and horse meat, which can be used as markers for meat authentication. Among the 105 peptides, 57 were verified by multiple reaction monitoring, enabling identification of each species with high specificity and selectivity. The most described and monitored species by LC-MS/MS so far are chicken and pork with 26 confirmed heat-stable peptide markers for each meat.

We investigated the metabolization of aflatoxins in chickens by analyzing excreta and ileal content and developed and validated a biomarker method for detection of aflatoxins and their metabolites in these matrices. Analysis of ileal content served to distinguish between urinary and fecal excretion combined in the excreta samples. During a 3-wk animal trial, one hundred sixty-eight 1-day-old chicks were randomly allocated to 24 pens with 7 chicks per pen and subjected to different feed regimens with: A) toxin-free feed, B) feed supplemented with 18 ng of total aflatoxins/g, and C) feed supplemented with 515 ng of total aflatoxins/g. Chicken excreta and ileal content were sampled after 7, 14, and 21 D. An analytical method based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was validated for the determination of aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2, M1, P1, Q1, and aflatoxin B1-N7-guanine (AFB1-N7-Gua) in chicken's samples. Comparing chicken excreta, which contain urine and feces, to ileal content, which contains no urine, we explored the secretion pathway of aflatoxin metabolites. The AFB1-N7-Gua was only detected in excreta, whereas aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) was detected both in ileal content and excreta. Aflatoxin M1 was detected in excreta in concentrations 5 times higher than in ileal content, suggesting primary excretion via urine. Although chickens are relatively resistant to aflatoxins, contamination of feed can lead to adverse effects and thus economic losses in farming. Therefore, a biomarker method to estimate the exposure of chickens to aflatoxins can play an important role to monitor the animals' health.",Poultry science,"['D000348', 'D000821', 'D000822', 'D000818', 'D015415', 'D002645', 'D002853', 'D005243', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D005766', 'D053719']","['Aflatoxins', 'Animal Feed', 'Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Feces', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Gastrointestinal Contents', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Determination of aflatoxin biomarkers in excreta and ileal content of chickens.,"['Q000302', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","['isolation & purification', 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198963,2020
31187991,"Protein-polyphenol interactions play a very important role in wine stability assessment, especially in red varieties. Different polysaccharides can influence these interactions by protecting or disrupting charges and are even used as additives to stabilize colloidal solutions. The most common examples are mannoproteins and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). In some cases, the mechanisms that are involved in these reactions are not thoroughly understood and can lead to unexpected problems and delayed haze formation after CMC addition to red wines. Small-scale bench trials were conducted in model systems under different pH conditions to monitor the formation of turbidity and protection mechanisms during the interaction of proteins, polyphenols, and polysaccharides. Egg-white protein was chosen as a protein model due to its complex composition, a commercial grape tannin extract was used as polyphenol source, and pectin, glucomannan, mannoprotein, alginate, and CMC were applied as polysaccharides to model various wine conditions. Reactions were monitored in duplicate on a 50 mL scale by spectrophotometry at 860 nm over at least 30 days. Some of the polysaccharides interacted directly with proteins or polyphenols causing precipitation.

Industrial feed fortificants used to improve egg yolk color and carotenoid concentration typically are derived from marigold flowers. Green leafy vegetables are also concentrated sources of the xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin (L+Z), but they have not been rigorously evaluated in laying hen feeds as a yolk colorant. The addition of food manufacturing byproducts, including carrot leaves, to animal feed is a promoted method of improving animal nutrition. The ability of dehydrated carrot leaves to improve egg yolk color and L+Z concentration was evaluated by feeding laying hens (n = 40) white maize-based feeds fortified with 2 different dehydrated carrot leaves, marigold as a positive control, or no fortificant as a negative control for 28 D. After a 7-D washout period, the hens were separated into 4 groups, and eggs were collected every other day. Yolks were analyzed by using a portable colorimeter to define the color space and by ultra-performance liquid chromatography to determine the carotenoid profile. Carotenoid concentration rapidly declined from day 0 to 8, confirming adequate washout conditions. The white maize negative control (WM) day 28 lutein concentration (3.59 ± 0.51 nmol/g) was significantly less than orange-carrot leaf-treated (OCL) (5.34 ± 0.36 nmol/g) and red-carrot leaf-treated hens (RCL) (5.92 ± 1.00 nmol/g) in addition to the marigold-treated hens (MG).

The results exhibited a good linearity (R ˃ 0.9983), a low detection limit (0.25 ng/mL), and a wide dynamic response range (0.25-1000 ng/mL). Our study revealed that tip-ESI not only performed equally well to capillary nESI in terms of flow rate (˂ 100 nL/min), signal sensitivity, and sample consumption, but also offered a number of additional advantages, including better signal duration, tolerance to high analyte concentration (> 100 μg/mL) and high ionizing voltage (up to 6 kV), and obviation of tip clogging and corona discharge. High compatibility of tip-ESI with various kinds of samples (aqueous, viscous, solid, or bulk biological samples) makes it a promising tool for direct MS analysis.",Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D032084', 'D004365', 'D004531', 'D004867', 'D005504', 'D020939', 'D018551', 'D019697', 'D012996', 'D041942', 'D021241', 'D013831', 'D014867', 'D015014']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Eggs', 'Equipment Design', 'Food Analysis', 'Ginger', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Onions', 'Solutions', 'Soy Milk', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Thiamine', 'Water', 'Yogurt']",Direct Analysis of Aqueous Solutions and Untreated Biological Samples Using Nanoelectrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry with Pipette Tip in Series with High-Ohmic Resistor as Ion Source.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000295', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'instrumentation', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834507,2019

30805876,"Cadmium (Cd), as one of the most toxic heavy metals, has become a widespread environmental contaminant and threats the food quality and safety. The protective effect of selenium (Se) on Cd-induced tissue lesion and cytotoxicity in chicken has been extensively reported. The objective of this study was to investigate the antagonistic effect of Se on Cd-induced damage of chicken pectoral muscles via analyzing the trace elements and amino acids profiles. Firstly, 19 trace elements contents were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that under Cd exposure, the contents of Cd, lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), aluminum (Al), and lithium (Li) were significantly elevated, and the contents of Se, iron (Fe), and chromium (Cr) were significantly reduced. However, supplementing Se significantly reversed the effects induced by Cd. Secondly, the amino acids contents were detected by L-8900 automatic amino acid analyzer. The results showed that supplementing Se increased significantly Cd-induced decrease of valine (Val), leucine (Leu), arginine (Arg), and proline (Pro). Thirdly, the results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed that cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), silicium (Si), and Pro may play special roles in response to the process of Se antagonizes Cd-induced damage of pectoral muscles in chickens. In summary, these results indicated that different trace elements and amino acids possessed and exhibited distinct responses to suffer from Se and/or Cd in chicken pectoral muscles.

30737629,"DNA methylation is involved in epigenetic mechanisms associated with gene suppression, and its abnormalities lead to gene instability and disease development. As an essential trace element in humans and animals, selenium (Se) is also associated with abnormal changes in DNA methylation. However, the effect of low Se on DNA methylation in avian tissues has not been reported. In the current study, chickens were fed a low-Se diet (0.033 mg Se/kg) or supplemented with 0.15 mg Se/kg as selenite for up to 55 days. DNA methylation levels were examined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and methyl-DpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) mRNA levels were examined through the applications of RT-PCR. The experiment aims to explore the relationship between low Se and DNA methylation. The results showed that total DNA methylation levels in the muscle tissues, brain, immune tissues, and liver of the low-selenium diet group were decreased compared with the control group. The degree of DNA methylation reduction in different tissues from largest to smallest was liver > cerebellum > thymus > brain > spleen ≥ leg muscles > pectoral muscles > bursa of Fabricius > thalamus > wing muscles. DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B mRNA expression levels of the low-selenium diet group were decreased compared with those in the control group. The mRNA expression of the MBD2 gene was increased.

30457325,"Catalytic DNA/RNA, such as DNAzyme, has been widely adopted to construct biosensors, especially for metal ion analysis. However, traditional DNAzyme biosensors still suffer from fluctuating and relatively high background. Herein, we proposed a temperature-robust DNAzyme, conferring ultralow background in various temperatures, thus leading to highly sensitive and robust detection of metal ions. Instead of labeling substrate to directly output fluorescence signal, our proposed DNAzyme biosensor utilized a sequential detection process with a couple of proximity fluorescent probes, confirming very low background regardless of the conditions of cleavage reaction. This sequential DNAzyme biosensor conferred a signal to background ratio over 20 when the temperature of the catalytic reaction ranged from 20 to 41 °C. Benefitting from its ultralow background, it could confer a detection limit of 0.22 nM, which ranked as one of the highest sensitivity levels among DNAzyme-based fluorescent biosensors.

However, DE measurement through AMEn is time-consuming and constraining. To simplify selection for DE, the potential of serum composition to predict AMEn was evaluated based on 40 birds from two broiler lines (D+ and D-) divergently selected on the fecal AMEn of a difficult-to-digest wheat-based diet. Differences in serum coloration were suspected between the two lines, and thus a spectrophotometric analysis was carried out, revealing a significant difference in absorption between 430 nm and 516 nm, corresponding to the signature of orange-red lipophilic pigments such as xanthophylls. To go further, the liposoluble fraction of the serum was explored for its lipidome by mass spectrometry. Discriminant analysis revealed that a pattern of 10 metabolites, including zeaxanthin/lutein, can explain 82% of the lipidomic differences between the two lines.

30125763,"Backyard chicken ownership is rapidly increasing in urban areas in the United States, largely as a way to provide eggs for household consumption. Despite elevated levels of environmental lead contamination in many US cities, the role of backyard chicken eggs as a pathway for lead exposure, particularly for children, has received limited scrutiny. To characterize lead exposure from consumption of backyard chicken eggs for children and predict related effects on blood lead level (BLL), we conducted a cross-sectional study of backyard chicken owners in the Greater Boston area (n = 51). We interviewed participants regarding egg consumption by household members and collected backyard eggs (n = 201) and coop soil samples (n = 48) for analysis. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to evaluate lead concentration in homogenized eggs and an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) portable device was used to assess soil lead levels in the laboratory. We used the USEPA's Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model for Lead in Children (IEUBK) to assess the relative contribution of backyard egg consumption to aggregate BLL in children. Four scenarios were developed in the IEUBK model to address variability in egg consumption rates and egg lead contamination. Lead was detected in egg samples from 98% of the households that provided egg samples. Mean household lead concentration was 0.10 μg/g (SD: 0.18). Egg lead concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection (0.0014 μg/g) to 1.798 μg/g (<1.4-1198 ppb). Egg lead levels were strongly positively correlated with lead concentration in coop soil (r = 0.64; p < 0.001). In modeled scenarios where a child < 7 years frequently ate eggs highly contaminated with lead, BLLs are predicted to increase by 0.9-1.5 μg/dL. In three other scenarios reflecting more moderate egg lead contamination and consumption rates, BLLs were predicted to increase from 0.1 to 0.8 μg/dL. Consumption of backyard chicken eggs can contribute to lead exposure in children.

Our study aims to investigate the preventive effects of WSW against AFB1-induced broiler liver injury. One day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly separated to 4 groups and were, respectively, fed with control diet, diet with 5 mg/kg AFB1 standard, diet with 5 mg/kg AFB1 standard and 214 ml/kg WSW, and diet with 214 ml/kg WSW continuously for 28 d. The histopathological, ultra-structural, and serological changes were tested to evaluate liver damage. The hallmarks of hepatocellular autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammation were measured by Western Blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The content of AFB1 in chicken liver was detected with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography linked with the fluorescence detection method. The results showed that (i) WSW restored AFB1-induced changes in serum biochemical parameters, and ameliorated histomorphological changes in hepatocytes, (ii) WSW reduced the content of AFB1 in chicken liver, (iii) WSW alleviated AFB1-induced autophagy inhibition by up-regulating hepatic LC3, beclin-1, and down-regulating hepatic mTOR and cytoplasmic P53 expressions, (iv) WSW alleviated AFB1-induced hepatocellular apoptosis via inhibiting pro-apoptotic gene expression (nuclear P53, Caspase3, Bax), and promoting anti-apoptotic gene expression (bcl-2), (v) WSW feeding ameliorated AFB1-induced liver inflammation via impeding TLR4/NF-${{\bf \kappa }}$B and IL-1/NF-${{\bf \kappa }}$B signaling pathways, down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1${{\bf \beta }}$, IL-6, and IL-8), and markedly up-regulating anti-inflammatory genes (IL-10 and HO-1).

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and PFCAs of 10-12 carbons were found in almost all of the samples in considerable concentrations in rice and pork liver, reaching as high as 283 ng/g (PFOA in pork liver); the levels are two to three orders of magnitude higher than previous reports. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the most frequently mentioned perfluoroalkyl substance, was rarely detected in many food items (detection frequencies <20% in rice, flour, pork, chicken, salmon, squid, eggs, and milk) at <0.4 ng/g, except for beef, pork liver and some seafood (detection frequencies: 100%, GMs: 0.05-3.52 ng/g).

Serum samples were collected on d 21 and were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of flight/mass spectrometry. The results showed that supplemental K. marxianus altered the concentrations of a variety of metabolites in the serum. Thereinto, a total of 39 metabolites were identified at higher (P < 0.05) concentrations while 21 metabolites were identified at lower (P < 0.05) concentrations in the treatment group as compared with the control. These metabolites were primarily involved with the regulation of amino acids and carbohydrate metabolism. Further metabolic pathway analysis revealed that glutamine and glutamate metabolism was the most relevant and critical pathway identified from these two groups.

The offer of novel edible oils from herbs, spices and fruit seeds has grown and many of them are used as functional food and dietary supplements but also as feed additives in animal feeding. Poultry meat is recommended.in properly balanced diet and its consumption in Poland has been growing. The objective of present study was to verify if the supplementation of chickens' diet with grape seed oil or pomegranate seed oil influences cholesterol content and fatty acids (FA) profile in their livers. Ross 308 chickens (n = 24) were fed with fodder enriched with grape seed oil (G group) or pomegranate seed oil (P group). Diet of control group (C group) was based on soybean oil. FA analysis in livers as well as cholesterol content was made with gas chromatography. We observed significant increase in fat content when part of soybean oil was replaced by grape seed oil (p = 0.0002). Its highest amount was detected in G group (4.44 ± 1.53%) whereas the lowest in C group (1.73 ± 0.53%). Applied supplementation did not change total cholesterol content. Its content ranged from 233.0 ± 12.2 mg/100 g in G group to 234.6 ± 29.7 mg1100 g in C group. However, chickens' diet modification with grape seed oil and pomegranate seed oil influenced the FA profile in livers. We detected the presence of punicic acid (cis-9, trans-11, cis-13 C18:3, PA) in livers of chicken fed with pomegranate seed oil. Pomegranate seed oil is one of natural sources of conjugated linolenic acids (CLnA), which predominate in this oil (PA >70% of all FA). However, in livers PA constituted only 0.90 ± 0.10% of all fatty acids. Furthermore, we detected substantial amounts of rumenic acid (cis-9, trans-11 C18:2, RA) - the major isomer of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). Its natural sources in diet are meat and milk of ruminants, but incorporation of pomegranate seed oil into chickens' diet caused a significant increase of its share in fatty acids pool in their livers (3.73 ? 0.79% in P group in relation to 0.08 ± 0.03% in G group and 0.02 ± 0.00% in C group, p < 0.0001).

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) patterns indicated that ovalbumin was surprisingly not incorporated in glutenins by covalent bond, whereas size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography showed that glutenin macropolymer content in glutenins increased slightly. Furthermore, dynamic rheology experiments indicated ovalbumin led to a decrease inG' andG″ of dough.

29397982,"This paper demonstrated the development and validation of an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous determination of five glycopeptide antibiotics in food and biological samples. The target glycopeptide antibiotics were isolated from the samples by solvent extraction, and the extracts were cleaned with a tandem solid-phase extraction step using mixed strong cation exchange and hydrophilic/lipophilic balance cartridges. Subsequently, the analytes were eluted with different solvents, and then quantified by UHPLC-MS/MS in the positive ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring. Under optimal conditions, good linear correlations were obtained for the five glycopeptide antibiotics in the concentration range of 1.0 μg/L to 20.0 μg/L, and with linear correlation coefficients >0.998. Employing this method, the target glycopeptide antibiotics in food and biological samples were identified with a recovery of 83.0-102%, and a low quantitation limit of 1.0 μg/kg in food and 2.0 μg/L in biological samples with low matrix effects.",Journal of chromatography.

29341601,"The increasing focus on lipid metabolism has revealed a need for analytical techniques capable of structurally characterizing lipids with a high degree of specificity. Lipids can exist as any one of a large number of double bond positional isomers, which are indistinguishable by single-stage mass spectrometry alone. Ozonolysis reactions coupled to mass spectrometry have previously been demonstrated as a means for localizing double bonds in unsaturated lipids. Here we describe an online, solution-phase reactor using ozone produced via a low-pressure mercury lamp, which generates aldehyde products diagnostic of cleavage at a particular double bond position. This flow-cell device is utilized in conjunction with structurally selective ion mobility-mass spectrometry. The lamp-mediated reaction was found to be effective for multiple lipid species in both positive and negative ionization modes, and the conversion efficiency from precursor to product ions was tunable across a wide range (20-95%) by varying the flow rate through the ozonolysis device. Ion mobility separation of the ozonolysis products generated additional structural information and revealed the presence of saturated species in a complex mixture. The method presented here is simple, robust, and readily coupled to existing instrument platforms with minimal modifications necessary. For these reasons, application to standard lipidomic workflows is possible and aids in more comprehensive structural characterization of a myriad of lipid species.",Analytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D002853', 'D004531', 'D005231', 'D020404', 'D007536', 'D008055', 'D010126', 'D021241']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Eggs', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Glycerophospholipids', 'Isomerism', 'Lipids', 'Ozone', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Determining Double Bond Position in Lipids Using Online Ozonolysis Coupled to Liquid Chromatography and Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry.,"[None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","[None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29341601,2019
29340658,"Food safety of table eggs is vital since many pathogens can contaminate the unfertilized egg, leading to increased risk of foodborne illness for consumers. The eggshell cuticle is the first line of defense to restrict the entry of egg-associated pathogens, such as Salmonella Enteritidis. The thickness and completeness of coverage of the cuticle layer are heritable traits that are strongly associated with egg resistance to bacterial penetration. The present study characterizes the chemical composition of the eggshell cuticle and structure of pore plugs from table eggs. Eggs collected from both brown and white egg laying Lohmann flocks (early, mid, and late lay) were either unwashed or washed. Pore plugs were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and elemental composition was determined using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). SEM observations confirmed that the plug formed by the cuticle layer within the eggshell pore remains firmly lodged throughout the commercial washing process. The eggshell thickness and cuticle pore length visualized in brown eggs was significantly higher than in white eggs in hens of all ages. EDS analysis revealed that the pore inner surface was enriched in phosphorus and chemically different from the surrounding bulk eggshell mineral. Detailed assessment of the cuticle chemical composition was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Washing of eggs removed cuticle from the eggshell surface. There was a trend of lower cuticle coverage with increasing hen age for white eggs. A significant reduction in the amount of proteins and phosphates and polysaccharides was observed in the cuticle of brown unwashed eggs with hen age. In white unwashed eggs, amides and lipids decreased with hen age; by contrast, the amount of sulfate was highest at mid-lay. The results from our research will assist selective breeding programs that target cuticle integrity and pore plug stability to enhance egg resistance to pathogen penetration and improve food safety.",Poultry science,"['D000367', 'D000818', 'D002645', 'D059022', 'D008855', 'D010063', 'D013052', 'D017550']","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Food Safety', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Ovum', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared']",Cuticle and pore plug properties in the table egg.,"[None, None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000662', 'Q000648', 'Q000662', 'Q000662']","[None, None, 'physiology', None, 'veterinary', 'ultrastructure', 'veterinary', 'veterinary']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29340658,2018

In this study, we compared the effect of water-soluble fractions isolated at the pilot scale from wheat grain incubated with (WE) and without (WC) MEP. The fractions were incorporated in a wheat-based diet (0.1% w/w) to feed Ross PM3 broilers and compared with a non-supplemented control group (NC). The body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) until d 14 were determined. At d 14, ileal and cecal contents and tissue samples were collected from euthanized animals. The intestinal contents were used to measure the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration using gas chromatography and to determine the abundance and composition of microbiota using 16S sequencing. Villi length of ileal samples was measured, while L-cell and T-cell densities were determined using immuno-histochemistry. The MEP treatment increased the amount of water-soluble arabinoxylans (AX) and reduced their molecular weight while retaining their polymer behavior. The WE fraction significantly (P < 0.05) increased FI by 13.8% and BWG by 14.7% during the first wk post hatch when compared to NC. No significant effect on FCR was recorded during the trial. The WE increased the abundance of Enterococcus durans and Candidatus arthromitus in the ileum and of bacteria within the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, containing abundant butyrate-producing bacteria, in the ceca. It also increased the concentration of SCFA in the ceca, decreased the T-lymphocyte infiltration in the intestinal mucosa, and increased the glucagon-like-peptide-2 (GLP-2)-producing L-cell density in the ileal epithelium compared with WC and NC. No significant effects were observed on villi length. These results showed that AX present in the WE fraction altered the microbiota composition towards butyrate producers in the ceca.

The 28 trace element levels in the blood were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The concentrations of As in the blood of chickens were elevated approximately 17.15-fold, 2.30-fold, and 13.37-fold in the As-group, Cu-group, and As + Cu-group, respectively, at 90 days. The concentrations of Cu did not change in the As-group and increased approximately 29.53 and 23.37% in the Cu-group and As + Cu-group, respectively, at 90 days. Moreover, As exposure caused ion profile disorders in the blood, including increased concentrations of Na, Mg, Si, K, Cr, Fe, and Se and reduced B, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, and Mo. Cu exposure increased the contents of Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, and Se and decreased the content of B, Ca, Al, Ni, and Mo. As + Cu exposure increased the contents of Mg, Si, Cr, Fe, Zn, and Se and decreased the content of B, Ca, Ti, Co, Ni, Sr, and Mo. Moreover, As and/or Cu exposure induced oxidative stress in the blood of chickens. In conclusion, the results indicated that the mixture of As and Cu caused a synergistic effect via disturbing homeostasis of trace elements and oxidative stress in the blood of chickens.",Environmental science and pollution research international,"['D000818', 'D000975', 'D001151', 'D000077237', 'D001152', 'D002645', 'D003300', 'D019327', 'D004032', 'D008297', 'D010087', 'D011897', 'D014131']","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Arsenic', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Chickens', 'Copper', 'Copper Sulfate', 'Diet', 'Male', 'Oxides', 'Random Allocation', 'Trace Elements']",Analysis of 28 trace elements in the blood and serum antioxidant status in chickens under arsenic and/or copper exposure.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000009', None, 'Q000009', 'Q000378', 'Q000009', 'Q000009', None, None, 'Q000009', None, 'Q000097']","[None, 'metabolism', 'adverse effects', None, 'adverse effects', 'metabolism', 'adverse effects', 'adverse effects', None, None, 'adverse effects', None, 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28967049,2018

In this study, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography linked with fluorescence detection (UPLC-FLD) method was optimized and validated. In addition, we investigated for the first time, the influence of curcumin on residue depletion of AFB1 and AFM1 in liver, kidney, and muscle tissues of broiler chickens and estimated a necessary clearance time required for AFB1 and AFM1 residues. The results showed that the average recoveries of AFB1 varied in liver, kidney, and muscles between 82.32-85.56, 85.34-88.45, and 84.88-89.73% respectively, while the average recoveries of AFM1 in liver, kidney, and muscles varied between 92.17-95.03, 94.12-97.21, and 95.32-98.51%, respectively. The detection limit of aflatoxin B1 was 0.008 ng/ml, while for aflatoxin M1 was 0.003 ng/ml. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for AFB1 and AFM1 was 0.02 and 0.01 ng/ml, respectively. Clearance time for AFB1 and AFM1 residues were analyzed in two experimental groups of broilers. One group fed with dietary AFB1 (5.0 mg/kg feed) and other with curcumin+AFB1 diet (curcumin; 300 mg/kg feed, AFB1; 5.0 mg/kg feed). AFB1 and AFM1 residues clearance time was calculated based on LOQ using withdrawal time calculation software (WT1.4). Clearance time analyzed for AFB1 ranged from 11 to 19 days and for AFM1 ranged from 10 to 12 days at 95% confidence level. Interestingly, curcumin supplementation in the diet reduced the clearance time of AFM1 in liver and kidney but not in muscle tissues. Conclusively, the developed method can be appropriately used for the quality control testing of commercial broiler-meat processing companies, food manufacturers, and quality control laboratories.",Frontiers in pharmacology,[],[],Development of a UPLC-FLD Method for Detection of Aflatoxin B1 and M1 in Animal Tissue to Study the Effect of Curcumin on Mycotoxin Clearance Rates.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28959206,2020
28946070,"Biomonitoring of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) typically uses measurement of metabolites of PAHs with four or less aromatic rings, such as 1-hydroxypyrene, even though interest may be in exposure to larger and carcinogenic PAHs, such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). An improved procedure for measuring two tetrol metabolites of B[a]P has been developed. Using 2 mL urine, the method includes enzymatic deconjugation of the tetrol conjugates, liquid-liquid extraction, activated carbon solid phase extraction (SPE) and Strata-X SPE, and gas chromatography-electron capture negative ionization-tandem mass spectrometric determination. Limits of detection were 0.026 pg/mL (benzo[a]pyrene-r-7,t-8,t-9,c-10-tetrahydrotetrol, BPT I-1) and 0.090 pg/mL (benzo[a]pyrene-r-7,t-8,c-9,c-10-tetrahydrotetrol, BPT II-1). We quantified BPT I-1 and BPT II-1 in urine from a volunteer who consumed one meal containing high levels of PAHs (barbequed chicken). We also measured urinary concentrations of BPT I-1 and BPT II-1 in smokers and nonsmokers, and compared these concentrations with those of monohydroxy PAHs (OH-PAHs) and cotinine. Urinary elimination of BPT I-1 and BPT II-1 as a function of time after dietary exposure was similar to that observed previously for OH-PAHs. While the median BPT I-1 concentration in smokers' urine (0.069 pg/mL) significantly differs from nonsmokers (0.043 pg/mL), BPT I-1 is only weakly correlated with cotinine. The urinary concentration of BPT I-1 shows a weaker relationship to tobacco smoke than metabolites of smaller PAHs, suggesting that other routes of exposure such as for example dietary routes may be of larger quantitative importance.",Chemosphere,"['D001564', 'D003367', 'D004781', 'D004784', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D011084', 'D011721']","['Benzo(a)pyrene', 'Cotinine', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons', 'Pyrenes']",Measurement of urinary Benzo[a]pyrene tetrols and their relationship to other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites and cotinine in humans.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000652']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', 'urine']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28946070,2018
28938786,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of a fast gas chromatography (GC) e-nose for freshness discrimination and for prediction of storage time as well as sensory and internal quality changes during storage of hen eggs. All samples were obtained from the same egg production farm and stored at 20 °C for 20 d. Egg sampling was conducted every 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 d. During each sampling time, 4 egg cartons (each containing 10 eggs) were randomly selected: one carton for Haugh units, one carton for sensory evaluation and 2 cartons for the e-nose experiment. The e-nose study included 2 independent test sets; calibration (35 samples) and validation (28 samples). Every sampling time, 5 replicates were prepared from one egg carton for calibration samples and 4 replicates were prepared from the remaining egg carton for validation samples. Sensors (peaks) were selected prior to multivariate chemometric analysis; qualitative sensors for principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant factor analysis (DFA) and quantitative sensors for partial least square (PLS) modeling. PCA and DFA confirmed the difference in volatile profiles of egg samples from 7 different storage times accounting for a total variance of 95.7% and 93.71%, respectively. Models for predicting storage time, Haugh units, odor score, and overall acceptability score from e-nose data were developed using calibration samples by PLS regression. The results showed that these quality indices were well predicted from the e- nose signals, with correlation coefficients of R2 = 0.9441, R2 = 0.9511, R2 = 0.9725, and R2 = 0.9530 and with training errors of 0.887, 1.24, 0.626, and 0.629, respectively. As a result of ANOVA, most of the PLS model results were not significantly (P > 0.05) different from the corresponding reference values.

28919552,"The determination of the trophic preferences of the Anopheles gambiae Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) is a decisive parameter for the monitoring and the prevention of malaria risk transmission. Currently, arthropod blood feeding sources are identified using immunological or molecular biology traditional techniques. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, they present several limitations, and notably, they are time-consuming and costly techniques. A recent study demonstrated that MALDI-TOF MS could be a useful tool for the identification of blood meal origins in freshly engorged mosquitoes. However, the limited number of blood vertebrate species tested to date, did not allow an assessment of the efficiency of MALDI-TOF MS in distinguishing blood MS spectra among close host species, such as humans versus primates. Therefore, in the present study, blood from ten distinct vertebrate host species, including four domestic species, four wild species, and two primates, was selected to control the reliability of MALDI-TOF MS based identification. Host blood species-specific MS profiles, up to 24h post-feeding in engorged Anopheles abdomens, were confirmed. Blind tests underlined the high specificity of MS spectra for the recognition of each host species, preventing misidentification. Nevertheless, an accurate analysis of the results from MS spectra queried against the MS database revealed that the reliability of identification is directly linked to the comprehensiveness of the MS reference database. Finally, the rapidity, the low-cost reagents, the simplicity of data analysis, and the accuracy of the tool for blood origin determination, make this proteomic strategy a promising complementary method for the elucidation of host/vector interactions.","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases","['D000818', 'D000852', 'D002144', 'D002417', 'D002645', 'D002685', 'D018397', 'D004901', 'D005260', 'D005518', 'D006041', 'D006801', 'D016778', 'D000072138', 'D046109', 'D010527', 'D040901', 'D015203', 'D013045', 'D019032']","['Animals', 'Anopheles', 'Callithrix', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Chiroptera', 'Equidae', 'Erythrocebus patas', 'Female', 'Food Preferences', 'Goats', 'Humans', 'Malaria, Falciparum', 'Mosquito Vectors', 'Passeriformes', 'Perissodactyla', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Species Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Accurate identification of Anopheles gambiae Giles trophic preferences by MALDI-TOF MS.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000097', 'Q000097', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000097', None, 'Q000635', 'Q000737', 'Q000097', 'Q000097', 'Q000295', None, None, 'Q000379']","[None, 'chemistry', 'blood', None, 'blood', 'blood', 'blood', 'blood', None, 'physiology', 'blood', None, 'transmission', 'chemistry', 'blood', 'blood', 'instrumentation', None, None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28919552,2019

In addition to assessing alpha-amylase activity, the microbiological quality of the samples was also evaluated by counting total and thermotolerant coliforms, mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, Staphylococcus spp., and Salmonella spp. The validated spectrophotometric method demonstrated linearity, with a coefficient of determination (R2) greater than 0.99, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 0.48 mg kg-1 and 1.16 mg kg-1, respectively, and acceptable precision and accuracy with relative standard deviation (RSD) values of less than 10% and recovery rates between 98.81% and 105.40%. The results for alpha-amylase activity in the raw egg samples showed high enzyme activity due to near-complete hydrolysis of the starch, while in the eggs pasteurized at 61.1°C, partial inactivation of the enzyme was observed. In the samples of whole eggs pasteurized at 64.4°C, starch hydrolysis did not occur due to enzyme inactivation.

One hundred eighty 7-day-old male chickens were randomly assigned into the control group, the Se group, the Pb group, and the Pb/Se group. Lead acetate was added in drinking water (350 mg/L Pb). Sodium selenite was added in the standard commercial diet (1 mg/kg Se). On the 30th, 60th, and 90th days of the experiment, 15 chickens of each group were euthanized. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, hematoxylin and eosin staining, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blot were used. The results indicated that excess Pb increased nitric oxide content; inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity; nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α, cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin E synthases, and iNOS mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner; NF-κB, iNOS, heat shock protein (HSP) 60, HSP70, and HSP90 protein levels; and Pb concentration. Excess Pb decreased Se concentration and induced histological changes. Se-alleviated Pb caused all of the above changes.

These disadvantages make them impossible for large-scale detection or being applied to the production line of meat factories. In this context, the great necessity of developing rapid and nondestructive techniques for fat and FAs analyses has been highlighted. Measurement techniques based on near-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and hyperspectral imaging have provided interesting and promising results for fat and FAs prediction in varieties of foods. Thus, the goal of this article is to give an overview of the current research progress in application of the four important techniques for fat and FAs analyses of muscle foods, which consist of pork, beef, lamb, chicken meat, fish and fish oil. The measurement techniques are described in terms of their working principles, features, and application advantages.

28006025,"Brown eggs are popular in many countries and consumers regard eggshell brownness as an important indicator of egg quality. However, the potential regulatory proteins and detailed molecular mechanisms regulating eggshell brownness have yet to be clearly defined. In the present study, we performed quantitative proteomics analysis with iTRAQ technology in the shell gland epithelium of hens laying dark and light brown eggs to investigate the candidate proteins and molecular mechanisms underlying variation in chicken eggshell brownness. The results indicated 147 differentially expressed proteins between these two groups, among which 65 and 82 proteins were significantly up-regulated in the light and dark groups, respectively. Functional analysis indicated that in the light group, the down-regulated iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein (Iba57) would decrease the synthesis of protoporphyrin IX; furthermore, the up-regulated protein solute carrier family 25 (mitochondrial carrier; adenine nucleotide translocator), member 5 (SLC25A5) and down-regulated translocator protein (TSPO) would lead to increased amounts of protoporphyrin IX transported into the mitochondria matrix to form heme with iron, which is supplied by ovotransferrin protein (TF). In other words, chickens from the light group produce less protoporphyrin IX, which is mainly used for heme synthesis. Therefore, the exported protoporphyrin IX available for eggshell deposition and brownness is reduced in the light group. The current study provides valuable information to elucidate variation of chicken eggshell brownness, and demonstrates the feasibility and sensitivity of iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis in providing useful insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying brown eggshell pigmentation.",PloS one,"['D000818', 'D030161', 'D002645', 'D004527', 'D004528', 'D005260', 'D010858', 'D040901', 'D019032']","['Animals', 'Avian Proteins', 'Chickens', 'Egg Proteins', 'Egg Shell', 'Female', 'Pigmentation', 'Proteomics', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",iTRAQ-Based Quantitative Proteomics Identifies Potential Regulatory Proteins Involved in Chicken Eggshell Brownness.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', None]","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28006025,2017

27730676,"Increased intestinal permeability (IP) can lead to compromised health in chickens. As there is limited literature on in vivo biomarkers to assess increased IP in chickens, the objective of this study was to identify a reliable biomarker of IP using DSS ingestion and fasting models. Male Ross chickens (n = 48) were reared until day 14 on the floor pen in an animal care facility, randomized into the following groups: control, DSS and fasting (each with n = 16), and then placed in metabolism cages. DSS was administered in drinking water at 0.75% from days 16 to 21, while controls and fasted groups received water. All birds had free access to feed and water except the birds in the fasting group that were denied feed for 19.5 h on day 20. On day 21, all chickens were given two separate oral gavages comprising fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d, 2.2 mg in 1 ml/bird) at time zero and lactulose, mannitol and rhamnose (LMR) sugars (0.25 g L, 0.05 g M and 0.05 g R in 2 ml/bird) at 60 min. Whole blood was collected from the brachial vein in a syringe 90 min post-LMR sugar gavage. Serum FITC-d and plasma LMR sugar concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry and high-performance ion chromatography respectively. Plasma concentrations of intestinal fatty acid binding protein, diamine oxidase, tight junction protein (TJP), d-lactate and faecal α-antitrypsin inhibitor concentration were also analysed by ELISA. FITC-d increased significantly (p < 0.05) after fasting compared with control. L/M and L/R ratios for fasting and L/M ratio for DSS increased compared with control chickens (p < 0.05). TJP in plasma was significantly increased due to fasting but not DSS treatment, compared with controls. Other tests did not indicate changes in IP (p > 0.05).

When 50 distinct strains of Campylobacter jejuni, C. lari, or C. coli were tested for inclusivity, all 50 strains produced positive results. In exclusivity testing, 31 strains of related organisms, including seven nontarget Campylobacter strains and other common species, were evaluated. All 31 species generated negative ANSR assay results, including the nontarget Campylobacter strains. The ANSR for Campylobacter method was compared to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook reference method using naturally contaminated chicken carcass rinse or turkey carcass sponge samples.

The contamination levels of aflatoxins, ochratoxins, and zearalenone in eggs and chicken feeds were simultaneously analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection after the post-derivatization. While E. coli was isolated from 9.1% of eggs, Salmonella species were not isolated. Arcobacter species were detected in 0.8% of eggs collected from egg layers by PCR only. While aflatoxins, ochratoxins, and zearalenone were found in 100%, 100%, and 85% of chicken feeds, their contamination levels were below the maximum acceptable levels (1.86, 2.24, and 147.53 μg/kg, respectively). However, no eggs were contaminated with aflatoxins, ochratoxins, or zearalenone.

27591630,"In the present research, a carrier mediated hollow fiber based liquid-phase microextraction approach (HF-LPME) prior to high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) was developed for the simultaneous determination of the antibacterial residues of four tetracyclines (TCs) and five quinolones (QNs), which are commonly used as veterinary medicines. In order to obtain high extraction efficiency, the parameters affecting HF-LPME were optimized using a three-factor and three-level Box-Behnken design under response surface methodology. This method was validated according to the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and, for the first time, successfully applied to a wide range of animal source food samples such as fish, milk, and honey as well as the liver and muscles of lamb and chicken. Analytical performance was determined in terms of linearity, intra- and inter-assay precision, detection and quantification limits, matrix effect, accuracy, and drug stability in real samples. Detection and quantitation limits for the different antibiotics ranged between 0.5-20ngg(-1) and 1.25-40ngg(-1), respectively. Intra and inter-day repeatability, expressed as the relative standard deviation, were in the ranges of 3.4-10.7% and 5.0-11.5%, respectively. The procedure allows good preconcentration factors of 175-700. The results of the validation process proved that the method is suitable for determining TCs and QNs residues in surveillance programs. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method was successfully confirmed by the extraction and determination of nine antibiotics in various animal source food samples. The importance of this methodology relies on the combination of HF-LPME/HPLC-DAD second-order data with multivariate curve resolution-alternative least squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm, which improves the resolution of some overlapped chromatograms and, hence, increases the accuracy and repeatability of drug determination.

The Cd supplement caused ion profile disorders, including reduced concentrations of V, Cr, Mn, Mo, As, Ba, Hg, Ti, and Pb and increased Si, Cu, Li, Cd, and Sb. The Se supplement reduced the contents of Co, Mo, and Pb and increased the contents of Cr, Fe, and Se. Moreover, Se also increased the concentrations of Cr, Mn, Zn, and Se and decreased those of Li and Pb, which in contrast were induced by Cd.

26964532,"The quality of chicken meat, which is one of the most widely consumed meats in the world, has been the subject of research and studies for many years. There are several ways to improve the quality of this type of meat, including changing the concentrations of individual molecular components. Such important components of meat are inter alia, cholesterol, vitamin E, and some fatty acids such as ω-3 and ω-6. Manipulation of ingredient levels may be achieved by enriching chicken feed with elements of different types such as vegetable oils, garlic, or selenium. Thus far, various biochemical and biophysical methods have been used to study quality of different meat types, especially broiler meat. Here, the authors demonstrate the use of high-resolution time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) mass spectrometry to assess how variations in animal nutrition affect concentrations of specific lipids in the meat, such as cholesterol and vitamin E. In the presented experiment, there were four different dietary treatments. Feed for animals in the first group was supplemented with soy oil in 50%, the second group's feed was supplemented with linseed oil in 50%, a combination of these two oils in the proportion of 44%:56% was used for the third group, and in the reference group, animals were fed with beef tallow. From each group, four individuals were selected for further analysis. Positive and negative ion mass spectra were generated from the pectoralis superficialis muscle tissue of the left carcass side of each one animal. Using TOF-SIMS with a bismuth cluster ion source (Bi3 (+)), and based on characteristic peaks for cholesterol in the positive mode and vitamin E in the negative mode, the authors have illustrated the relationship of these lipids levels to the various feeding regimens. Simultaneously, the authors characterized the varying dependences on the concentrations of measured lipids in fat and muscle fibers. The cholesterol concentration in muscle fibers was the lowest in the group fed with soybean oil and the highest in reference group IV (tallow feed). In the fatty region, the highest level of cholesterol was found in the third group. The highest concentrations of vitamin E were found in the fibers of the first group and the fat region of the second group. The obtained results show that SIMS imaging is a useful approach for assessing changes in lipid concentrations in the meat tissue from animals on different diets and provides a foundation for future research.

Changes in liver proteome were measured by iTRAQ labeling and LC-ESI-MS/MS. A robust set totaling 1437 unique proteins was identified and subjected to differential protein analysis and biological interpretation. Compared with casein, all other protein sources reduced the abundance of proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism and Pparα signaling pathway. All dietary proteins, except chicken, increased oxidoreductive transformation reactions but reduced energy and essential amino acid metabolic pathways. Only soy protein increased the metabolism of sulfur-containing and nonessential amino acids. Soy and fish proteins increased translation and mRNA processing, whereas only chicken protein increased TCA cycle but reduced immune responses.

To evaluate the toxicokinetics and persistence of residues of NIV, NIV was administered intravenously (iv) or orally (po) to broiler chickens at a dosage of 0.8 mg/kg body weight. The concentration of NIV in the plasma and various tissues was detected using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. The plasma concentration of NIV in broilers could be measured up to 24 h and 12 h after iv and po administration, respectively. The value of elimination half-life of NIV was 5.27 ± 0.82 h and 2.51 ± 0.88 h after iv and po administration, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability was 3.98 ± 0.08%.

In this study, we used RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence to detect the expression of recombinant human lysozyme (rhLY) in the transgenic chicken. We demonstrated that the transgene of rhLY was genetically stable across different generations. We next optimized the purification procedure of rhLY from the transgenic eggs by utilizing two steps of cation-exchange chromatography and one gel-filtration chromatography. About 6 mg rhLY with the purity exceeding 90% was obtained from ten eggs, and the purification efficiency was about 75%. The purified rhLY had similar physicochemical and biological properties in molecular mass and antibacterial activity compared to the commercial human lysozyme. Additionally, both of them exhibited thermal stability at 60°C and tolerated an extensive pH range of 2 to 11. In conclusion, our study proved that the transgenic chickens we have previously generated were genetically stable and suitable for the production of active rhLY.

The results showed that relative amounts (RAs) of the most detected VAs were firstly increased to maximum values in oil samples collected at the second hour of the seventh day and the values were then decreased with the increase in the time of oil heating process (control). However, for food frying processes, the time needed for reaching maximum RAs of VAs was shorter and the values were decreased with the increase in frying time. Significant change in contents of the VAs was observed for oil samples fried with CBM due to the high contents of water, protein, and lipid content compared to oil samples fried with WD. Based on the obtained results, free radical reaction, particularly positional isomerization and cis-trans isomerization, was deduced to occur when WD or CBM was fried in SBO.

In these eggs, all PFAS levels were below the LOQ of 0.5 ng g(-1), except for a small amount of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in 1 sample in each country (1.1 ng g(-1) and 0.9 ng g(-1) for the Netherlands and Greece respectively). PFOS was the predominant PFAS, making up on average 85% of ∑PFASs. The highest PFOS concentration was detected in a Dutch home produced egg sample (24.8 ng g(-1)). The contamination pattern was similar in both countries with the long-chain PFASs (C ≥ 8) being most frequently detected, while short-chain PFASs were rarely found.

The Biolex(®) MB40 is a commercial prebiotic that contains mannanoligosaccharides. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of prebiotic Biolex(®) MB40 on cecal microbiota of conventionally raised chickens using PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and assessing Salmonella prevalence. Chickens were randomly selected and distributed into three groups; a negative control (NC) and two treatment groups (T1 and T2). The NC group was fed a non-medicated feed, while the treatment groups were fed either T1 or T2, 0.05% antibiotic (BMD50) or 0.2% Biolex(®) MB40 respectively. During the study, cecal contents and bird feed were plated on selective media for Salmonella, yeast and mold prevalence analysis. Ten chickens from each group were randomly selected at 1, 2, 4 and 6 wk and ceca were extracted for DNA isolation for PCR-based DGGE. Also, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were analyzed from collected cecal material by gas chromatography. Only 4.2% of the samples were Salmonella positive. Presence of class 1 integron from cecal material were analyzed by PCR and 97.5% of the cecal samples were positive for integron presence, but no class I integrons were detected in the Salmonella isolates. According to the PCR-based DGGE analysis, the T2 group exhibited a cecal microbial population pattern that was similar to the T1 group prior to wk 4 and the T2 group appeared to be almost identical with the NC group after wk 4 but T2 exhibited less Bacteroides rodentium prior to wk 4. Overall results showed that the commercial prebiotic, MB40 did not lead to a detectable reduction of Salmonella but the general frequency of Salmonella was minimal in all treatments. However, feeding an MB40 supplement did result in similar DGGE band patterns as the T1 group indicating that cecal microbiotia were potentially similar in these 2 groups. Overall, it appears that MB40 (T2) exhibited similar DGGE-cecal population patterns as BMD50 (T1) which suggests that these treatments may have influenced the populations in a comparable fashion.

26096773,"A field study was conducted in Wisconsin (USA) to characterize in ovo mercury (Hg) exposure in common loons (Gavia immer). Total Hg mass fractions ranged from 0.17 µg/g to 1.23 µg/g wet weight in eggs collected from nests on lakes representing a wide range of pH (5.0-8.1) and were modeled as a function of maternal loon Hg exposure and egg laying order. Blood total Hg mass fractions in a sample of loon chicks ranged from 0.84 µg/g to 3.86 µg/g wet weight at hatch. Factors other than mercury exposure that may have persistent consequences on development of chicks from eggs collected on low-pH lakes (i.e., egg selenium, calcium, and fatty acid mass fractions) do not seem to be contributing to reported differences in loon chick quality as a function of lake pH. However, it was observed that adult male loons holding territories on neutral-pH lakes were larger on average than those occupying territories on low-pH lakes. Differences in adult body size of common loons holding territories on neutral-versus low-pH lakes may have genetic implications for differences in lake-source-related quality (i.e., size) in chicks.

26057097,"Two sensitive and selective spectrofluorimetric methods are proposed to determine ethopabate (ETH) and amprolium hydrochloride (AMP). First derivative synchronous spectrofluorimetry determines the natively fluorescent ethopabate at 288 nm in presence of amprolium hydrochloride which is a non fluorescent quaternary compound with average recovery 100.54±0.721 over a concentration range of 0.01-0.8 μg/mL. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) are 0.002 and 0.007 μg/mL, respectively. The second method is direct synchronous spectrofluorimetry for determining amprolium hydrochloride at 362 nm after a reaction with 5% NaOH and 0.08% potassium ferricyanide that is optimized by a two-level factorial design. This method is linear over a concentration range of 0.01-0.65 μg/mL with average recovery 99.4±1.28. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) are 0.002 and 0.006 μg/mL, respectively. The proposed methods are found to be valid and applicable for the analysis of ETH and AMP in their veterinary formulation.

26051081,"A sample preparation method was developed for the analysis of chicken eggs to determine 97 GC and 81 LC amenable residues, including organophosphates, organochlorines, pyrethroids, triazoles, carboxyl-containing compounds, and the indicator PCBs. Hereby, considerations were given to the recoveries of the analytes, the method's suitability for routine analysis, and the assessment of the clean-up effect, for which a simple thin layer chromatography was implemented to visualize the most important lipid classes. The procedure consisted of (I) the extraction by matrix solid phase dispersion, and the clean-up by means of (II) small-scale gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and (III) two different solid phase extractions (SPE) for GC and LC amenable analytes, as well as (IV) the quantification using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS. Cyclohexane/ethyl acetate was chosen as extraction solvent due to its suitability for extracting strong non-polar but also more polar analytes. The classical GPC was scaled down to ensure a 50% lower solvent consumption. The comprehensive investigation of conventional and modern zirconium-oxide-coated SPE materials resulted in the selection of octadecyl-modified silica (C18) combined with primary secondary amine using acetonitrile as elution solvent for GC amenable analytes and pure C18 in combination with acidified methanol for LC amenable pesticides. Compared to the currently established EN 1528 method the sample preparation proposed offered a higher sample throughput and a lower solvent consumption. Furthermore, for the first time the clean-up effectiveness of the sample preparation steps was documented as shown by means of thin-layer chromatography. The validation of chicken eggs proved the fulfillment of the quality control criteria for 164 of the 178 analytes tested, mostly at the lowest validated level of 5μg/kg for pesticides and 0.5μg/kg for the single indicator PCBs. However, the analysis of strongly polar analytes was still problematic, which could be attributed to the extraction and the GPC step. Nevertheless, the successful investigation of EU proficiency test materials (EUPT AO 07-09) confirmed the comparability of the results with the currently established sample preparation procedures and demonstrated the potential of the applicability of the presented method to other matrices as exemplified for lean poultry meat and fatty liquid cream.

26015592,"Tetracyclines, which represent one of the most commonly used antibiotics for poultry, are known to be deposited in bones, where they can remain, despite the observation of appropriate withdrawal times. The aim of the study was to determine the concentration of oxytretracycline (OTC) residues in the bone and muscle of chickens, following the oral administration of a commercially available liquid formulation, and to test their cytotoxic effects on an in vitro cell culture model. Seventy-two 1-day-old broiler chickens were randomly allotted into 2 groups (control and treated animals). OTC (40 mg/kg BW) was administered via drinking water during the 1 to 5 and 20 to 25 days of life periods. At the end of the trial, the birds were slaughtered and the OTC residues in the target tissues were measured by means of liquid chromatography (LC) - tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Cytotoxicity was assessed by evaluating the pro-apoptotic effect of the bone residues on the K562 erythroleukemic line and on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In all the animals, the OTC residues in the muscle were far below the established MRL of 100 μg/kg. The OTC levels in the bones of the treated animals were instead found in the parts per million (ppm) range. Cell cytotoxicity was assessed by evaluating the pro-apoptotic effect of OTC bone residues on the haematopoietic cell system. This in vitro system has revealed a significant pro-apoptotic effect on both the K562 cell line and PBMC cultures. This result suggests potential human and animal health risks due to the entry of tetracycline residues contained in the bones of treated livestock into the food-chain. This could be of concern, particularly for canine and feline diets, as meat, bone meal, and poultry by-products represent some of the main ingredients of pet foods, especially in the case of dry pet food. Further studies are needed to define the underlying mechanisms of cytotoxicity and to evaluate the in vivo toxicological implications due to the observed in vitro effects.

25997844,"A multi-residue analytical method was developed for the determination of a range of flame retardants (FRs), including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), emerging halogenated FRs (EFRs) and organophosphate FRs (PFRs), in food matrices. An ultrasonication and vacuum assisted extraction (UVAE), followed by a multi-stage clean-up procedure, enabled the removal of up to 1g of lipid from 2.5 g of freeze-dried food samples and significantly reduce matrix effects. UVAE achieves a waste factor (WF) of about 10%, while the WFs of classical QuEChERS methods range usually between 50 and 90%. The low WF of UVAE leads to a dramatic improvement in the sensitivity along with saving up to 90% of spiking (internal) standards. Moreover, a two-stage clean-up on Florisil and aminopropyl silica was introduced after UVAE, for an efficient removal of pigments and residual lipids, which led to cleaner extracts than normally achieved by dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE). In this way, the extracts could be concentrated to low volumes, e.g. <100 μL and the equivalent matrix concentrations were up to 100g ww/mL. The final analysis of PFRs was performed on GC-EI-MS, while PBDEs and EFRs were measured by GC-ECNI-MS. Validation tests were performed with three food matrices (lean beef, whole chicken egg and salmon filet), obtaining acceptable recoveries (66-135%) with good repeatability (RSD 1-24%, mean 7%). Method LOQs ranged between 0.008 and 0.04 ng/g dw for PBDEs, between 0.08 and 0.20 ng/g dw for EFRs, and between 1.4 and 3.6 ng/g dw for PFRs. The method was further applied to eight types of food samples (including meat, eggs, fish, and seafood) with lipid contents ranging from 0.1 to 22%.

25459646,"Human exposure to high concentrations of arsenic from water and food is an important health concern. Although 3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylarsonic acid (Roxarsone) was used for more than 60 years as a feed additive to feed chickens, little is known about the metabolism of this arsenic species in chicken. Determination of potential arsenic metabolites present at trace concentrations is an analytical challenge, requiring efficient separation and sensitive detection. The primary objective of this research is to develop a method that enables the identification and quantification of various arsenic species in chicken liver. This report describes a method of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation with both inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) detection. Anion exchange HPLC enabled the separation of Roxarsone and other arsenic species within 12 min. Detection with both ICPMS and ESI-MS/MS allowed for identification and quantification of eight arsenic species in chicken livers, including arsenobetaine, inorganic arsenite, dimethylarsinic acid, monomethylarsonic acid, inorganic arsenate, 3-amino-4-hydroxyphenylarsonic acid, N-acetyl-4-hydroxyphenylarsonic acid (N-AHPAA), and Roxarsone. The concentrations of these arsenic species, with the exception of arsenobetaine, are significantly higher in the Roxarsone-fed chickens than in the control chickens. The simultaneous detection by both ICPMS and ESIMS from the same HPLC separation allowed for comparison of peaks in both ICPMS and ESIMS chromatograms. This is advantageous over two separate analyses, particularly when HPLC retention times might fluctuate due to sample matrix effect. HPLC separation with the complementary atomic and molecular mass spectrometry detection prevented misidentification of co-eluting compounds, as demonstrated by the determination of two possible metabolites of Roxarsone, N-AHPAA and 4-amino-phenylarsonic acid (4-APAA). N-AHPAA was confirmed by HPLC separation with simultaneous arsenic-specific detection by ICPMS and multiple reaction monitoring by ESIMS. Although an arsenic-containing compound had identical retention time as 4-APAA in the HPLC–ICPMS chromatogram, it was ruled out as 4-APAA from the simultaneous detection by ESIMS. The identification and quantitation of trace arsenic species present in complex samples demonstrate the potential of HPLC separation with simultaneous ICPMS and ESIMS detection for other speciation applications.",Journal of chromatography.

25445915,"Vitamin D fortified food can help to reduce the prevalence for vitamin D deficiency. Previous data provided evidence that eggs from hens exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light contain large quantities of vitamin D. In the current study, we assessed the efficacy of vitamin D enrichment in eggs upon increasing daily UVB exposure times. We further addressed the question whether extended UVB irradiation affects the skin content of 7-dehydrocholesterol. To this end, 35 hens were assigned to 7 groups of 5 animals each and were exposed to UVB light (76μW/cm(2)) for 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 300min per day, respectively. Eggs from the treatment groups were collected at baseline and after 2, 3 and 4 weeks of treatment, respectively. Skin samples were gained at the end of 4 weeks. Vitamin D metabolites were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The contents of vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 in egg yolk raised non-linear in response to increasing daily UVB exposure times. The vitamin D3 content did not reach a clear-cut plateau within the chosen UVB treatment times. A daily UVB exposure time of 300min resulted in vitamin D3 contents of 28.6μg/100g egg yolk dry matter. In contrast to vitamin D3, the 25(OH)D3 content in the egg yolk achieved a maximum upon an UVB irradiation time of 60min/d. The cutaneous 7-dehydrocholesterol contents were not altered in response to the chosen UVB irradiation times. In conclusion, the data show a distinct non-linear dose-response relationship of UVB exposure times on the total vitamin D content in eggs.

25418882,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and other small grain cereals is a globally devastating disease caused by toxigenic Fusarium pathogens. Controlling FHB is a challenge because germplasm that is naturally resistant against these pathogens is inadequate. Current control measures rely on fungicides. Here, an antibody fusion comprised of the Fusarium spp.-specific recombinant antibody gene CWP2 derived from chicken, and the endochitinase gene Ech42 from the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma atroviride was introduced into the elite wheat cultivar Zhengmai9023 by particle bombardment. Expression of this fusion gene was regulated by the lemma/palea-specific promoter Lem2 derived from barley; its expression was confirmed as lemma/palea-specific in transgenic wheat. Single-floret inoculation of independent transgenic wheat lines of the T3 to T6 generations revealed significant resistance (type II) to fungal spreading, and natural infection assays in the field showed significant resistance (type I) to initial infection. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed marked reduction of mycotoxins in the grains of the transgenic wheat lines. Progenies of crosses between the transgenic lines and the FHB-susceptible cultivar Huamai13 also showed significantly enhanced FHB resistance. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the tissue-specific expression of the antibody fusion was induced by salicylic acid drenching and induced to a greater extent by F. graminearum infection. Histochemical analysis showed substantial restriction of mycelial growth in the lemma tissues of the transgenic plants. Thus, the combined tissue-specific and pathogen-inducible expression of this Fusarium-specific antibody fusion can effectively protect wheat against Fusarium pathogens and reduce mycotoxin content in grain.

25264912,"This study aims to develop an LC-MS/MS method allowing the determination of 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, deoxynivalenol and its main in vivo metabolite, deepoxy-deoxynivalenol, in broiler chickens and pigs. These species have a high exposure to these toxins, given their mainly cereal based diet. Several sample cleanup strategies were tested and further optimized by means of fractional factorial designs. A simple and straightforward sample preparation method was developed consisting out of a deproteinisation step with acetonitrile, followed by evaporation of the supernatant and reconstitution in water. The method was single laboratory validated according to European guidelines and found to be applicable for the intended purpose, with a linear response up to 200ngml(-1) and limits of quantification of 0.1-2ngml(-1). As a proof of concept, biological samples from a broiler chicken that received either deoxynivalenol, 3- or 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol were analyzed. Preliminary results indicate nearly complete hydrolysis of 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol to deoxynivalenol; and to a lesser extent of 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol to deoxynivalenol. No deepoxy-deoxynivalenol was detected in any of the plasma samples. The method will be applied to study full toxicokinetic properties of deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol in broiler chickens and pigs. ","Journal of chromatography.

25259730,"In this Article, our previously developed ambient LESA-MS methodology is implemented to analyze five types of thermally treated meat species, namely, beef, pork, horse, chicken, and turkey meat, to select and identify heat-stable and species-specific peptide markers. In-solution tryptic digests of cooked meats were deposited onto a polymer surface, followed by LESA-MS analysis and evaluation using multivariate data analysis and tandem electrospray MS. The five types of cooked meat were clearly discriminated using principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis. 23 heat stable peptide markers unique to species and muscle protein were identified following data-dependent tandem LESA-MS analysis. Surface extraction and direct ambient MS analysis of mixtures of cooked meat species was performed for the first time and enabled detection of 10% (w/w) of pork, horse, and turkey meat and 5% (w/w) of chicken meat in beef, using the developed LESA-MS/MS analysis. The study shows, for the first time, that ambient LESA-MS methodology displays specificity sufficient to be implemented effectively for the analysis of processed and complex peptide digests.

24853518,"Bacillus cereus group bacteria are opportunistically pathogenic spore-forming microorganisms well known in the sector of pasteurized food products because of their involvement in spoilage events. In the sector of egg product processing, these bacteria may lead to important economic losses. It seemed then relevant to study their behavior in egg white, a widely used egg product usually recognized as developing different levels of antimicrobial activities depending on the environmental conditions. A strong bactericidal effect (decrease in the bacterial population of 6.1 ± 0.2 log CFU/ml) was observed for 68 B. cereus group isolates, independently incubated at 30°C in egg white at pH 9.3 (natural egg white pH). To determine which components could explain such a strong bactericidal effect, an experimental strategy was carried out, based on egg white fractionation by ultrafiltration and by anion-exchange liquid chromatography. The role of the protein fraction was thus demonstrated, and subsequent nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses allowed identification of ovotransferrin as a major protein involved. The strong bactericidal effect was confirmed in the presence of commercial ovotransferrin. Such a bactericidal effect (i.e., a decrease in the bacterial population through cell death) had never been described because ovotransferrin is known for its bacteriostatic effect (i.e., inhibition of growth) due to its ability to chelate iron. Surprisingly, the addition of iron did not reverse the bactericidal effect of ovotransferrin under alkaline conditions (pH 9.3), whereas it completely reversed this effect at pH 7.3. Ovotransferrin was shown to provoke a perturbation of the electrochemical potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. A membrane disturbance mechanism could, hence, be involved, leading to the lysis of B. cereus group bacteria incubated in egg white.",Journal of food protection,"['D000818', 'D000900', 'D001409', 'D002645', 'D003207', 'D004529', 'D004531', 'D006863']","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacillus cereus', 'Chickens', 'Conalbumin', 'Egg White', 'Eggs', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration']",Ovotransferrin plays a major role in the strong bactericidal effect of egg white against the Bacillus cereus group.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000382', None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'microbiology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853518,2014

Twenty-four hens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were allocated at random to 1 of 4 treatments: control (C, no marker), Zn chlorophyllin, Mg chlorophyllin, or Fe chlorophyllin. All markers were incorporated into mash before pelleting at a rate of 1 g/kg of DM. The experiment consisted of two 4 × 4 Latin squares with each period consisting of 2 wk. Feces were collected and extracted in acetone:water (50:50; vol/vol) with fecal fluorescence emission spectra determined using a Jasco FP-6200 Spectrofluorometer with excitation at 382 nm. A main peak evolved at wavelength 670 nm with the total area under the peak used as fluorescence intensity. Following 7 d of marker supplementation, the 3 markers improved the fluorescence intensity by ×14.8, 12.8, and 6.9 for Fe, Mg, and Zn chlorophyllin, respectively, compared with the control. The addition of feces containing Mg chlorophyllin to chicken carcass increased detection of the feces compared with feces with no marker. Also, due to the plain background of chicken skin, a simple image at 675 nm with appropriate thresholds would allow detection of contaminated carcasses at the current slaughter line speed without the need of expensive hyperspectral imaging.

Calibration models predicting odor measured by dilution olfactometry from NMVOC concentrations via orthogonal projection to latent structures (O-PLS) made good predictions (Rp(2)=0.83-0.87, RMSEp=137-175OU) using one to eight NMVOCs with either one or two latent variables representing odor concentration and character, respectively. Similar changes in odorant composition were observed in each sampling campaign, with samples collected early in the day more odorous and more sulfurous than samples collected later in the day. High litter moisture favored sulfur-containing odorants over alcohols, aldehydes and ketones but had little bearing on perceived odor, whereas high bird density favored alcohols, aldehydes and ketones over sulfur-containing odorants. Eight VOCs that were important predictors of odor across all sheds in order of decreasing importance were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), 2-3 butanedione, 3-methyl-butanal, 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, acetoin, and 2-butanone. Four additional NMVOCs also influenced perceived odor although less predictably; these were n-hexane, 2-butanol, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and 1-octen-3-ol. All of the odorants are associated with microbial or fungal activity in the litter and manure, except n-hexane, which may originate from hexane-extracted soybean meal in the chicken feed.

One hundred frozen chicken muscle samples were sourced from major markets in Lagos and Ibadan (fifty samples each). The samples were analyzed using high power liquid chromatography (HPLC) for tetracycline residue determination while atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was used to determine the levels of lead and cadmium residues in the samples. Mean concentrations of tetracycline residue levels in the frozen chicken sampled ranged from 1.1589-1.0463ppm which is higher than the maximum residue limit set by international food safety agencies. Pb contents were higher in chicken muscles sampled from markets in Ibadan (0.0227 +/- 0.0069 microg dL(-2)) than Lagos (0.0207 +/- 0.0082 microg dL(-1)), while Cd levels were 0.0013 microg dL(-1) higher than in the Lagos samples (0.0065 +/- 0.0026 microg dL(-1)). These values were within maximum residue limits. There were no significant differences (p < 0.05) in levels of tetracycline, lead and cadmium levels from the two market locations (Lagos and Ibadan) and parts (wings and thigh muscles). However, significant differences occurred in tetracycline and Pb levels in frozen chicken sourced from Cotonou. Though not significant, tetracycline contents in the thigh muscles of the frozen chicken samples was higher than that of the wings muscles and this was attributed to the site of administration of antibiotic injection and failure to observe the pre-slaughter withdrawal period by the farmers.

It also shown that the cuticle composition, thickness, and degree of coverage are highly dependent on hen age and egg freshness. During the course of the first laying year, the thickness and degree of glycosylation of the cuticle decreases with hen age, and at the end of the laying cycle, the cuticle is significantly depleted in lipids. There are also well-defined compositional changes in the cuticle of freshly laid eggs as time passes and there is a notable increase in the permeability of the eggshell after 24 h due to cuticle drying.

A toxicosis in 6,000 laying hens caused by the malicious addition of unknown amounts of coumatetralyl bait as well as the insecticides aldicarb, methomyl, and imidacloprid in the drinking water, was investigated in the current study. In order to determine a possible carryover of coumatetralyl into eggs, a rapid and reliable analytical method was developed and fully validated for the simultaneous detection of 6 anticoagulant rodenticides (warfarin, coumatetralyl, coumachlor, bromadiolone, difenacoum, and brodifacoum) in yolk and albumen using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. The method developed was reproducible, sensitive, accurate, and linear within the range of 0.01-1 mg/kg, which is the concentration range of bromadiolone and warfarin found in yolk in previously reported studies. The coefficient of variations of within and between days was 1.0-8.5% for yolk and 0.6-3.8% for albumen, while recoveries from spiked albumen and yolk samples were all in the range of 79-99% and 51-95%, respectively. Limits of detection in yolk were 0.01 mg/kg for warfarin and 0.003 mg/kg for the remaining compounds; in albumen, the limit of detection was 0.003 mg/kg for warfarin, coumatetralyl, and coumachlor, and 0.0015 mg/kg for difenacoum and brodifacoum. The application of the validated method revealed the presence of coumatetralyl in the yolk only at levels of 0.0057 mg/kg and 0.0052 mg/kg on the second and fourth day of the poisoning.

Milk samples spiked with single species and multiple species cultures were incubated in a selective enrichment broth for 24h, followed by an additional 6h secondary enrichment. As few as 1 colony-forming unit (cfu) of L. monocytogenes per mL of initial selective broth culture could be detected within 30h.

After using a standard microwave oven to assist protein digestion, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were tagged with chemical analogues, such as 2-mercaptoethanol and 3-mercapto-1-propanol, to enable simultaneously relative quantitation and identification. This method enabled the use of thio alcohols for direct labeling of phosphorylated sites (not labeled at the mercapto, amino, hydroxyl, or carboxyl groups) of phosphopeptides. Various digestion parameters (e.g., microwave power, reaction time, NH4HCO3 concentration) and derivatization efficiency parameters (e.g., reaction time, labeling tag concentration) were studied and optimized. In both control and experimental samples, microwave-assisted digestion coupled with relative quantitation using analogue tags enabled calculation of phosphopeptide ratios in the same sequence. A non-labeling method was also established for quantifying phosphopeptides in human plasma by using the abundant protein albumin as an internal control for normalizing relative quantities of phosphopeptides.

A follow-up study of laying hens from this farm has demonstrated the transfer of dioxins into all tested tissues (breast and leg muscles, abdominal fat), liver and ovarian follicles. The bioaccumulation of dioxins was found to be congener and tissue-dependent. The highest concentration was found in the liver, followed by the ovarian follicles, and the adipose tissue. The PCDD/F levels in the liver often were approximately two times higher from those in other materials from the same hen. The potential dioxin intakes with eggs were expressed as the percent of the Tolerable Weekly Intake (TWI), and the Provisional Tolerable Monthly Intake (PTMI). The weekly intake of dioxins would be 3.5 pg WHO-TEQ/kg b.w. (24.9% TWI) for an adult and 20.3 pg WHO-TEQ/kg b.w. (145.2% TWI) for a 3-year old child. Considering a monthly consumption of such contaminated eggs, intake of dioxins would be slightly lower, but still over 100% of the PTMI for a child. The obtained results complement the knowledge on possible dioxin sources in food and are important for risk management authorities.",The Science of the total environment,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D004147', 'D004781', 'D004784', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D010063', 'D011044', 'D011078', 'D012989']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Dioxins', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Ovum', 'Poland', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Soil Pollutants']",Soil as a source of dioxin contamination in eggs from free-range hens on a Polish farm.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23933450,2014

The performance of the proposed methodology for the intended determination was firstly evaluated by determination of the endogenous PCB levels in a naturally contaminated internal reference material. The determined concentrations showed a good agreement with those obtained using a more conventional sample preparation procedure previously validated in our laboratory (recoveries, as compared to levels determined using the latter method, were in the 85-123% range for a large majority of the studied congeners, and the relative standard deviations were in general lower than 14%). Results obtained for the analysis of reference food samples and certified reference materials NIST 1945 and 1947 demonstrated that, when combined with gas chromatography coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry working in the tandem mode, GC-ITD(MS/MS), the proposed methodology allowed accurate determination of most of the investigated PCBs and that 50 mg of sample sufficed for the screening of less abundant toxic congeners.",Journal of chromatography.

Polynesian outliers are islands on the fringe of Remote Oceania that were inhabited by a back migration of populations from Polynesia during prehistory. As a result of admixture with nearby island communities, little is known about the social structure and social diversity of the prehistoric inhabitants of Taumako. The distribution of prestige grave goods within the Namu cemetery has been used as evidence to support the premise that Taumakoan social structure was stratified like Polynesian societies. Here we test the hypothesis that ""wealthy"" individuals and males will display isotopic ratios indicative of the consumption of ""high status"" foods in the Pacific islands such as pork, chicken, sea turtle, and pelagic fish. The isotope results suggest the δ(34) S values were diagenetically altered, possibly an effect of volcanism. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios indicate that the diet of all the individuals included a mixture of C3 terrestrial plant foods (likely starchy staples such as yam, taro, and breadfruit, in addition to nuts) and a variety of marine resources, including reef and pelagic fish.

23819612,"1. The objective of this study was to investigate in vitro and in vivo (in broiler chickens) ochratoxin A (OTA) adsorption efficiency of three different adsorbents: inorganic (modified zeolite); organic (esterified glucomannans) and mixed (inorganic and organic components plus enzymes). 2. The aim of the study was to investigate which of these adsorbents provided the best protection against the presence of residues of OTA in the pectoral muscle and liver of broilers given an OTA-contaminated diet. In addition, it was important to test and compare the results of adsorbent efficiency using two different in vitro methods. 3. The results from classical in vitro investigations carried out in the artificial intestinal fluid, showed that the inorganic adsorbent (Mz), exhibited the highest adsorption, having adsorbed 80.86 ± 1.85% of OTA, whereas average in vitro adsorption abilities of organic (30.52 ± 3.50%) and mixed (32.00 ± 2.60%) adsorbents were significantly lower. 4. In the investigation of absorption in everted sacs of broiler duodenal segments (Everted Duodenal Sacs Procedure), higher OTA adsorption in gut was exhibited by organic adsorbent, 74.26 ± 4.48%. Furthermore, the mean adsorption efficiency of mixed and inorganic adsorbent was 65.26 ± 4.76% and 45.75 ± 7.14%, respectively. 5. In the in vivo investigation, broilers were fed for 21 d on diets containing 2 mg/kg of OTA and supplemented with inorganic (Mz), organic (Ms) or mixed adsorbent (Mf) at the recommended concentration of 2 g/kg of feed. All three adsorbents significantly decreased OTA residue concentrations in the pectoral muscle and livers, but the order of effectiveness was mixed > organic > inorganic. The most efficient was the mixed adsorbent which decreased residue concentration by 72.50% in pectoral muscle and 94.47% in livers. 6.

Levels of HCAs have been extensively investigated in meat products but not in fish products. Here, we report levels of HCAs in fried salmon, tuna, hake, sardine, angler fish, cod, sole, swordfish, squid, and cuttlefish. The HCA levels of some of these foods have not been previously analyzed. We employed multivariate factor-analysis tools, including principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares (PLS) regression, to study the effects of cooking weight loss and levels of creatine, glucose, and free amino acids on HCA levels. The highest concentrations of mutagenic HCAs, 159.3 ng·g(-1) total, where 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) accounted for 121 ng·g(-1), were found in fried swordfish (cooking loss of 51.8%). These levels are higher than those generally found in fried chicken, which is typically cited as the most contaminated food item. Thus, swordfish is among the richest known sources of HCAs. The other cooked seafood items contained from 0.4 to 35.4 ng·g(-1) HCAs, comparable to concentrations typically reported for meat. Chemometric analysis showed that the fish species is the most influential parameter on the formation of HCAs such as DMIP, PhIP, and norharman. Concentrations of histidine, lysine, creatine, and glucose, as well as weight loss, also influence the yield of HCAs. These results suggest that seafood is an important dietary source of HCAs.

It employed the avian antibodies (IgY) that recognized isoprothiolane as a capture reagent and isoprothiolane-alkaline phosphatase conjugate as an enzyme label. The assay depended on the competitive binding between the anti-isoprothiolane antibody and isoprothiolane derived from rice, soil, and water samples for binding sites with immobilized isoprothiolane-ovalbumin (OVA) conjugate. The concentration of isoprothiolane in the rice, soil, and water samples was quantified by the ability of the pesticide present in the samples to inhibit the binding of the enzyme conjugate to the antibody and subsequently the color formation in the assay. The assay was specific to isoprothiolane with a limit of detection of 2 ng/mL. Mean analytical recovery of isoprothiolane in different rice matrices was 87.20%-98.02%, for soil samples recovery was 74.24%-111.20%, and water samples recovery was 35.2%-95.73%.

A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (RP-HPLC-FLD) method was developed to determine AMO residues in albumen, yolk and whole egg. By using pre-column derivatisation, an improved liquid-liquid extraction procedure was developed for sample preparation. AMO were extracted from eggs with acetonitrile. The extract solution was extracted using saturated methylene chloride. The supernatant was reacted with salicylaldehyde under acidic and heating conditions. Limits of detection (LODs) were 1.2 ng g⁻¹ and limits of quantification (LOQs) were 3.9 ng g⁻¹ for AMO. Recoveries of AMO from samples fortified at levels of 5.0-125.0 ng g⁻¹ ranged from 79.1% to 88.5% in albumen, 78.6-83.6% in yolk and 78.3-85.1% in whole egg, with coefficients of variation of ≤7.3%. The maximum concentrations of AMO in albumen, yolk and whole egg were found to occur at 1.5, 2.5, 1.5 days after withdrawal of medication respectively. AMO was not detectable in albumen at 7.5 days after final administration of AMO, at 10.5-11.5 days in yolk and 10.5 days in whole egg after administration of two oral doses.

The main objective of the present study was to investigate, in the chicken, the interactions between Se, Cd and the following elements: Sb, Ca, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, V and Zn. 2. A total of 300 1-d-old chickens (broilers) were randomly distributed among 4 dietary treatments with 5 replicate pens per treatment. In T1, chickens were fed on a diet with 0·3 mg/kg added Se, without added Cd. In T2, chickens were fed on a diet with 0·3 mg/kg Se and 10 mg/kg Cd. In T3, chickens were fed on a diet with 0·3 mg/kg Se and 100 mg/kg of Cd added and in T4 treatment, chickens were fed on a diet with 3 mg/kg Se and 100 mg/kg Cd added. Se was added as Se-yeast. Cd was added as cadmium chloride (CdCl₂). On d 28 and 42, two chickens per replicate pen were killed for collection of whole blood, liver, kidney and breast muscle samples. Samples were analysed by ICP-MS. The data were analysed using a multivariate linear model. 3. While low Cd concentrations in the diet led only to an increase of Cd concentration in the examined tissues, addition of high concentrations of Cd increased the concentration of Cd, Cu, Sb and V and decreased that of Se, Mn and Fe. Addition of high Se concentrations did not significantly reduce Cd concentration. 4. Prior to model application, correlations of 78 elements were noted, while after model application 39 correlations were noted.

In particular, 90 laying hens were randomly allocated to three dietary treatments and fed diets contaminated with melamine at a level of 2.5, 25 and 250 mg of melamine/kg of diet for T1, T2 and T3 groups, respectively. The diets were offered in six replicate boxes (five hens each) for 13 days. Eggs were collected from each group for melamine quantification on days 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 13. At the end of the experimental period, one hen per box was randomly selected and slaughtered to collect plasma, liver, kidney and muscle samples. During the experiment, feeding diets with increasing levels of melamine had no effect (P > 0.05) on weight gain, feed intake, egg production, egg weight and mortality of laying hens. The melamine in eggs increased from day 1 after melamine ingestion and reached a plateau between days 6 and 13 of melamine ingestion.

The Cd was added to diets T2, T3 and T4 as CdCl2. On the 4th and 6th week, two broilers per replicate pen were killed in order to obtain whole blood, liver, kidney and breast samples. Body mass, feed conversion ratio and mortality were assessed and haematological analyses were performed. Se and Cd levels in tissues were analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Broilers supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg Se can tolerate low levels of Cd added to the diets, as there were no significant negative effects on the examined performance parameters, whereas addition of excess Cd led to an impairment of broilers' performance. Mortality of broilers did not differ between the four dietary treatments at any interval point or the whole period. The examined haematological parameters such as haematocrit, total blood protein concentration, and leukocytes types ranged within physiological values, revealing no negative health effects after simultaneous Cd and Se addition.

However, optimization based solely on n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) enrichment in chicken meat could lead to lower meat quality, unless the withdrawal period (plan) is applied for 1 week. The present study investigated whether the incorporation of FO in the diet for 32 days followed by its withdrawal for 1 week affected blood lipid profiles, lipoprotein particles, performance and meat flavor in male broiler chickens. Two hundred and forty birds (1-day-old, Ross 308) were assigned to 1 of 4 dietary groups: 0%, 1%, 2% or 3% FO with four replicates. Broilers were fed for 49 days according to a 4-phase feeding program. The experimental phase comprised day 11 to 42, and FO was removed on day 42. Blood samples were collected during the pre- and post-withdrawal period after the recordings before slaughter. The FO groups demonstrated decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and increased high-density lipoprotein levels on day 42 (P < 0.01); however, these values were not significant after design withdrawal. Diet supplementation with FO elevated the blood levels of palmitic acid (C16:0) and n-3 PUFAs, especially long-chain (LC) PUFAs (EPA, C20:5n-3 and DHA, C22:6n-3), and caused a decline in the level of arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4n-6; P < 0.05). Application of a one-week withdrawal period resulted in a decrease in (P < 0.05) linoleic acid (C18:2n-6) and an increase in the level of AA, unlike their amounts on day 42.

However, the potential risk of template leakage used in molecularly imprinted polymer is a major disadvantage. To solve this problem, 2-(4,6-diamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-ylamino) ethanethiol disulfide, a molecule that shares the similar imprinting sites with cyromazine and melamine, was selected as pseudo template to prepare molecularly imprinted polymer. Methacrylic acid, ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate and toluene were selected as functional monomer, crosslinker and porogen, respectively. The molecular recognition property and binding capability of cyromazine and melamine were evaluated by adsorption test and Scatchard analysis. The results showed that the molecularly imprinted polymer based on pseudo template had more excellent affinity and selectivity for cyromazine and melamine. The resulting molecularly imprinted polymer was used as a solid-phase extraction material to enrich cyromazine and melamine in egg and milk samples for high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The solid-phase extraction process was carefully optimized.

The multi-toxin profiles in 58 commercial poultry feed samples collected from 19 districts in 17 states of Nigeria were determined by LC/ESI-MS/MS with a single extraction step and no clean-up. Sixty-three (56 fungal and seven bacterial) metabolites were detected with concentrations ranging up to 10,200 µg kg⁻¹ in the case of aurofusarin. Fusarium toxins were the most prevalent group of fungal metabolites, whereas valinomycin occurred in more than 50% of the samples. Twelve non-regulatory fungal and seven bacterial metabolites detected and quantified in this study have never been reported previously in naturally contaminated stored grains or finished feed. Among the regulatory toxins in poultry feed, aflatoxin concentrations in 62% of samples were above 20 µg kg⁻¹, demonstrating high prevalence of unsafe levels of aflatoxins in Nigeria. Deoxynivalenol concentrations exceeded 1000 µg kg⁻¹ in 10.3% of samples.

22683919,"Behavioural effects of fluvoxamine (FLV, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) were examined in 1-2 week old domestic chicks. Chicks were tested in an I-shaped maze equipped with a feeder (ON feeder) that served 1 or 2 grains of millet at gradually increasing intervals, so that a depleting food patch was mimicked. By leaving the feeder, the food delivery program was reset, and chicks gained food at short intervals only after a travel to a dummy feeder (OFF feeder) placed on the opposite side of the maze. Chicks quickly learned to actively shuttle between the ON and the OFF feeders. FLV (intra-peritoneal injection, 20 mg/kg BW) acutely caused chicks to stay longer at the gradually depleting ON feeder. Inter-temporal choices were also tested, whereby two coloured beads were simultaneously presented, each associated with a small/short-delay reward or a large/long-delay alternative. FLV suppressed the choice of the short-delay option. It is suggested that an enhanced level of serotonin (5-HT) makes chicks more tolerant of the delayed food item in both behavioural paradigms. Furthermore, the decision to leave a depleting patch cannot be equated to choosing the long-delay option of the choice paradigm. Furthermore, FLV suppressed work efforts (velocity and running distance) in uncued shuttle and number of distress calls. In vivo microdialysis experiments revealed that FLV enhanced the extracellular concentration of 5-HT as well as dopamine (DA) locally in the medial striatum/nucleus accumbens.

Each person avoided food with known high PAH-content during the study period, except for a high PAH-containing lunch (barbecued chicken) on the first day. Individual urine samples (n = 217) were collected from 15 h before to 60 h following the dietary exposure. Levels of all OH-PAHs in all subjects increased rapidly by 9-141-fold after the exposure, followed by a decrease consistent with first-order kinetics, and returned to background levels 24-48 h after the exposure. The average time to reach maximal concentration ranged from 3.1 h (1-naphthol) to 5.5 h (1-PYR). Creatinine-adjusted urine concentrations for each metabolite were analyzed using a nonlinear mixed effects model including a term to estimate background exposure. The background-adjusted half-life estimate was 3.9 h for 1-PYR and ranged 2.5-6.1 h for the other 9 OH-PAHs, which in general, were shorter than those previously reported. The maximum concentrations after barbecued chicken consumption were comparable to the levels found in reported occupational settings with known high PAH exposures.

LC-MS/MS, with positive and negative electrospray ionization methods, was used for the determination of parent compounds and metabolites in yolk and egg white and was validated according to criteria established by Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The decision limit (CCα) and the detection capability (CCβ) of the analytical methodology for metabolites were 0.1 and 0.5 μg/kg for AMOZ and 0.3 and 0.9 μg/kg for DNSAH, respectively. For the parent compounds, CCα and CCβ were 0.9 and 2.0 μg/kg for furaltadone and 1.3 and 3.1 μg/kg for nifursol, respectively.

22483913,"An improved method, based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), has been developed to determine the bioactive dipeptides carnosine (CAR) and anserine (ANS) in chicken broth. These analytes are hydrophilic (polar) and in order to improve their retention, the chromatographic mode used was hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) (1.7 μm particle size). In order to remove the salt before the chromatographic analysis of the chicken broth (0.8%, w/w), an exhaustive sample pre-treatment strategy was necessary since the salt is not volatilized and could block the ionization source and lead to signal suppression. The chicken broth was firstly centrifuged to remove the fat and chicken proteins, and then was pretreated by off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE), using traditional cartridges, or off-line μElution plate (μSPE), using microplates, and the results were compared. Due to the high polar character of the dipeptides studied and the sample matrix, these compounds were not retained in the sorbent hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced (HLB) and were eluted in the load step, whereas the salt was retained in the sorbent. This fact was observed by the addition of silver nitrate in the chicken broth extract, where before the SPE or μSPE a white precipitate (silver chloride) was formed and after the SPE or μSPE this precipitate was not observed. By using these sample pre-treatment strategies, the extraction recoveries were higher than 80%, and the matrix effect was lower than 12%. Once the improved method was developed, the quality parameters of the method were studied. The LODs and LOQs of the CAR and ANS were lower than 6 and 1.8 μg/l, respectively. Then, the method was applied to analyse a commercial chicken broth. This improved method allowed determining CAR and ANS between 6 and 10mg dipeptide/l chicken broth in 10 min (sample pre-treatment and chromatographic analysis).

22468327,"Published datasets of proteinaceous animal tissues suggest that co-variation between amino acid hydrogen (δ²H) and oxygen (δ¹⁸O) isotope ratios is a common feature in systems where isotopic variation is driven by geographic or temporal variation in the δ²H and δ¹⁸O values of environmental water. This has led to the development of models relating tissue δ²H and δ¹⁸O values to those of water, with potential application in a number of fields. However, the strength and ubiquity of the influence of environmental water on protein isotope ratios across taxonomic groups, and thus the relevance of predictive models, is an open question. Here we report strong co-variation of δ²H and δ¹⁸O values across a suite of terrestrial and aquatic animal meats purchased in American food markets, including beef, poultry (chicken and turkey), chicken eggs, pork, lamb, freshwater fish, and marine fish. Significant isotope co-variation was not found for small collections of marine bivalves and crustaceans. These results imply that isotopic signals from environmental water were propagated similarly through most of the diverse natural and human-managed foodwebs represented by our samples. Freshwater fish had the largest variation in δ²H and δ¹⁸O values, with ranges of 121‰ and 19.2‰, respectively, reflecting the large isotopic variation in environmental freshwaters. In contrast marine animals had the smallest variation for both δ²H (7‰ range, crustaceans) and δ¹⁸O (3.0‰ range, bivalves) values.

A fractionation procedure was set up to create multiple fractions of the feed, which were subsequently analysed by NMR and UPLC-TOF/MS operating in positive mode. Comparison of the profiles revealed that the most apparent differences came from the isoflavones in the soy as well as a compound with a molecular mass of 441.202 (M + 1)⁺, which was identified as N,N'-diferuloylputrescine (DFP) and came from the corn. Whether the observed differences in effects are due to the higher levels of isoflavones and DFP is unclear, as is the fact whether the observed differences are typical for organic or conventional produced corn and soy.

22174646,"The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the effects of feeding grains naturally contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins on morphometric indices of jejunum and to follow the passage of deoxynivalenol (DON) through subsequent segments of the digestive tract of broilers. A total of 45 1-d-old broiler chickens (Ross 308 males) were randomly allotted to three dietary treatments (15 birds/treatment): (1) control diet; (2) diet contaminated with 1 mg DON/kg feed; (3) diet contaminated with 5 mg DON/kg feed for five weeks. None of the zootechnical traits (body weight, body weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion) responded to increased DON levels in the diet. However, DON at both dietary levels (1 mg and 5 mg DON/kg feed) significantly altered the small intestinal morphology. In the jejunum, the villi were significantly (P < 0.01) shorter in both DON treated groups compared with the controls. Furthermore, the dietary inclusion of DON decreased (P < 0.05) the villus surface area in both DON treated groups. The absolute or relative organ weights (liver, heart, proventriculus, gizzard, small intestine, spleen, pancreas, colon, cecum, bursa of Fabricius and thymus) were not altered (P > 0.05) in broilers fed the diet containing DON compared with controls. DON and de-epoxy-DON (DOM-1) were analyzed in serum, bile, liver, feces and digesta from consecutive segments of the digestive tract (gizzard, cecum, and rectum). Concentrations of DON and its metabolite DOM-1 in serum, bile, and liver were lower than the detection limits of the applied liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Only about 10 to 12% and 6% of the ingested DON was recovered in gizzard and feces, irrespective of the dietary DON-concentration. However, the DON recovery in the cecum as percentage of DON-intake varied between 18 to 22% and was not influenced by dietary DON-concentration. Interestingly, in the present trial, DOM-1 did not appear in the large intestine and in feces. The results indicate that deepoxydation in the present study hardly occurred in the distal segments of the digestive tract, assuming that the complete de-epoxydation occurs in the proximal small intestine where the majority of the parent toxin is absorbed. In conclusion, diets with DON contamination below levels that induce a negative impact on performance could alter small intestinal morphology in broilers.

22023855,"The interference standard method (IFS) is evaluated to improve the accuracy of the determination of S, Mn and Fe in meat and grain samples by inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS). Due to ICP-QMS relatively low resolution, polyatomic interferences caused by (16)O(2)(+), ((16)OH)(2)(+), (40)Ar(14)NH(+), and (40)Ar(16)O(+), for example, can compromise determinations at m/z 32, 34, 55, and 56, respectively. In IFS, differently from traditional internal standard methods, plasma naturally occurring species are used to correct for variations in the interference signal rather than the analyte signal. The method is based on the hypothesis that the interfering ion and the IFS probe present similar behaviors in the plasma, and that by using the analytical (analyte plus interference)/IFS signal ratio one could reduce variations due to interference and, consequently, improve accuracy. In this work, this strategy is evaluated in real sample applications and significant improvements on accuracy are observed for (32)S, (34)S, (55)Mn, and (56)Fe determinations. Recoveries ranging from 72% for Mn to 105% for Fe in two different standard reference materials are obtained using the (38)Ar probe.

Lipid oxidation was measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and volatile profile by dynamic headspace gas chromatography. Adding bacterial autolysate to diets did not affect the total content of saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids in thigh meat, but increased the levels of C14:0, C16:0, C18:0 and C16:1n-7 and reduced the levels of C18:1n-7, C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 fatty acids. Feeding of bacterial autolysate tended (p < 0.08) to reduce TBARS of meat samples. Contents of volatiles were generally low, but feeding of bacterial autolysate significantly reduced levels of butanal (p < 0.04) and tended to reduce levels of hexanal (p < 0.11), pentanal (p < 0.09), 1-penten-3-ol (p < 0.08) and butanone (p < 0.08). Bacterial autolysate had no effects on sensory quality parameters of meat related to odour and flavour. To conclude, adding bacterial autolysate to diets did not affect the relative proportion of saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, but reduced content of volatiles in frozen-stored broiler meat.

Targeted analytes were for nine FQs of marbofloxacin (MAR), ofloxacin (OFL), norfloxacin (NOR), ciprofloxacin (CIP), enrofloxacin (ENR), danofloxacin (DAN), orbifloxacin (ORB), difloxacin (DIF) and sarafloxacin (SAR), and three AQs of oxolinic acid (OXA), nalidixic acid (NAL) and flumequine (FMQ). Samples comprised ten different food products covering five matrices: muscle (cattle, swine and chicken), liver (chicken), raw fish (shrimp and salmon), egg (chicken), and processed food (ham, sausage and fish sausage). This method involved a simple extraction with (1:1) acetonitrile-methanol, a highly selective clean-up with an immobilised metal chelate affinity column charged with Fe(3+), a fast isocratic LC analysis using a short column (20 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 µm) with a mobile phase of (15:85:0.1) methanol/water/formic acid, and fluorescence detection (excitation/emission wavelengths of 295 nm/455 nm for FQs (495 nm for MAR), and 320 nm/365 nm for AQs). Among FQs, pairs of NOR/OFL, ORB/DIF and ENR/DAN were incompletely resolved. A confirmatory LC run with a Mg(2+) containing methanolic mobile phase was also proposed for the samples suspected of being positive. The optimised method gave satisfactory recoveries of 88.5% (56.1-108.6%) and 78.7% (44.1-99.5%) for intra- and inter-day assays with relative standard deviations of 7.2% (0.7-18.4%) and 6.8% (1.4-16.6%), respectively.

Egg yolks from each of these egg types (n = 162) were analysed to determine brominated flame retardant levels, specifically polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD). PBDEs were detected in 100% of the 162 samples tested, while HBCD was observed in 85% of the egg yolks. Total PBDE concentrations in egg yolks ranged from 0.018 to 20.9 ng g(-1) lipid (median = 3.03 ng g(-1) lipid), with PBDE 209 identified as being the major contributor to ΣPBDE concentrations. In addition to PBDE 209, PBDE 99, 47, 100, 183 and 153 were important contributors to ΣPBDE concentrations. Total HBCD concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection to a maximum concentration of 71.9 ng g(-1) lipid (median = 0.053 ng g(-1) lipid). The α-isomer was the dominant contributor to ΣHBCD levels in Canadian egg yolks and was the most frequently detected HBCD isomer.

One hundred and twenty broiler chickens were allocated into four experimental groups (36 birds each). Three of them were treated with 24 mg/kg bw orally for five consecutive days of each flumequine formulation, whereas one group remained untreated (12 birds as control group). After the treatment ended, six chickens of each experimental group and two controls were slaughtered daily for 6 days. Samples of muscle, liver and feathers were collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS). The WDTs showed differences between formulations. Flumequine concentrations found in feathers remained high during WDT and after this period, thus suggesting that the WDTs estimated for the pharmaceutical formulation of flumequine do not guarantee the absence of this drug in chicken nonedible tissues such as feathers.",Journal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics,"['D000284', 'D000818', 'D000890', 'D002645', 'D004305', 'D004350', 'D005241', 'D024841', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D018482', 'D011897', 'D014018']","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Chickens', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Residues', 'Feathers', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Random Allocation', 'Tissue Distribution']",Depletion study of three formulations of flumequine in edible tissues and drug transfer into chicken feathers.,"[None, None, 'Q000008', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000008', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, None, 'administration & dosage', 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'administration & dosage', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21395608,2011

A simple isocratic reversed-phase (RP) HPLC method with a mobile phase containing citric acid and sodium hexanesulfonate (pH 2.0) was developed using a C(18) column. The use of an organic solvent free mobile phase turns this methodology into an environmentally friendly alternative. Several ion pair forming agents, such as sodium hexanesulfonate, tetrabutylammonium bisulfate and perfluoroheptanoic acid, were studied. The limits of detection for As species were calculated in standard solution and resulted to be 0.2, 0.5, 0.6, 1.6, and 1.6 μg As L(-1) for MMAA, DMAA, p-ASA, ROX and NIT, respectively.

A total of 128 day-old chicks (Gallus gallus, broilers) were used to investigate the effect of Se yeast supplementation on the accumulation of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). There were four replicates of four dietary treatments: T1 (basal diet with no added Se, analyzed to contain 0.21 mg kg(-1)), T2 (T1 with 0.15 mg kg(-1) Se added), T3 (T1 with 0.3 mg kg(-1) Se) and T4 (T1 with 3.0 mg kg(-1) Se). At week 4 and 6, two chickens per replicate pen were sacrificed for whole blood, breast muscle and liver sampling. Samples were analyzed by ICP-MS. Supplementation with Se-yeast, not only increased Se concentration but also reduced Cd concentration in the tissues. Selenium was negatively correlated with Cd and positively correlated with Zn, Cu and Fe. Cadmium was negatively correlated with Zn and Cu. Zinc was positively correlated with Cu. Iron was negatively correlated with Cu and uncorrelated with Zn and Cd. The balance between Se, Cu, Fe and Zn is important for proper antioxidant defense since they are an integral part of various antioxidant enzymes.","Food additives & contaminants.

Increasing levels of BPM increased (linear, P < 0.0001) the content of saturated fatty acids, tended (linear, P = 0.05) to increase the content of monounsaturated fatty acids, and tended (linear, P = 0.08) to decrease the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the meat. Feeding BPM reduced (linear, P ≤ 0.03) levels of the volatile lipid oxidation products butanal, hexanal, heptanal, and nonanal in the meat during frozen storage but had no significant effects on the sensory quality parameters related to odor and flavor. The presence of antioxidants in BPM may have reduced lipid oxidation in the meat.

HCAs were extracted by blue rayon, analyzed as spiked and unspiked samples with high-performance liquid chromatography and its mutagenic response was assessed by Sallmonela typhimurium 100 in the Ames test. Surprisingly, GT and GT+OL augmented HCAs measured in beef shawerma and grilled chicken but total HCAs measured in GT+OL were less than GT treatment. Both treatments altered the HCA profile as imidazoquinoline type became the most abundant. In control and GT+OL fried beef liver no HCAs were detected, but Trp-P1 was detected in GT treatment. Generally, the mutagenic response of HCAs measured in GT+OL was less than GT in beef shawerma and grilled chicken. However, the mutagenic response of control and 2% GT+OL fried liver was negative. These data suggest that GT concentrations used in this study may induce free radical formation during the Millared reaction due to its pro-oxidative effect, which augmented the HCAs formed and its mutagenic response.

21122867,"The bottleneck of applying stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) to elemental speciation analysis is lack of suitable extraction phases with good affinities to different elemental species. In this paper, a newly high polar extraction phase of titania immobilized polypropylene hollow fiber (TiO₂-PPHF) was prepared by sol-gel immersion and low temperature hydrothermal process and the obtained TiO₂-PPHF inherits the adsorption properties of TiO₂ and the toughness of PPHF. With a suitable size of stainless steel magnetic bar inserted into the prepared TiO₂-PPHF, a disposable TiO₂-PPHF coating stir bar was obtained. The prepared TiO₂-PPHF was characterized by X-ray diffraction spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy and the significant parameters affecting the extraction efficiency of different arsenic species were studied. Based on the above facts, a new method of SBSE combined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was developed for the speciation of phenyl arsenic compounds and their possible transformation products in chicken tissues. Under the optimal conditions, limits of detection (LODs) of the developed method for eight target arsenic species were in the range of 11.4-64.6 ng L⁻¹ with enrichment factors of 8.5-22.3 (theory enrichment factor was 50), and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were varying from 6.3 to 12.6% (c(AsIII/V)=5 μg L⁻¹, c(MMA,DMA,p-ASA,4-OH,3-NHPAA,PA,4-NPAA)=10 μg L⁻¹, n=7).

In the present study, we identified the cDNA encoding chicken prepro-PrRP, which can generate putative PrRPs, and cloned and sequenced it. Sequences for the coding region suggested the occurrence of putative PrRPs of 20, 31 and 32 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of chicken PrRP20 showed 100%, 95% and 70% identity with those of PrRP20s from teleosts, Xenopus laevis and mammals, respectively. On the other hand, chicken PrRP31 showed approximately 90% and 52-55% homology to PrRP31s of X. laevis and mammals, respectively. Native chicken PrRPs were purified from an acid extract of chick brain by a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA), affinity chromatography using anti-salmon PrRP serum, and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an ODS-120T column (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan). The existence of chicken PrRP20 and PrRP31 in the brain was demonstrated by comparing them with the synthetic peptides using HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Chicken PrRP31 increased plasma PRL concentration when administered peripherally, whereas central administration decreased the concentration, suggesting that chicken PrRP31 has a distinct effect on PRL secretion between tissues in chicks. On the other hand, plasma growth hormone concentration decreased with both peripheral and central administrations of chicken PrRP31.

21038852,"As a consequence of the adulteration of infant formulas and milk powders with melamine (MEL) in China in 2008, much attention has been devoted to the analysis of MEL [and cyanuric acid (CA)] in dairy products. Several methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or Raman spectroscopy have been described in the literature. However, no method is available for the simultaneous determination of MEL and CA in other raw materials, which are considered as high-risk materials for economically motivated adulteration. The present paper reports the results of an interlaboratory-based performance evaluation conducted with seven laboratories worldwide. The purpose was to demonstrate the ability of a cleanup-free LC-MS/MS method, originally developed for cow's milk and milk-powdered infant formula, to quantify MEL and CA in egg powder and soy protein. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.02 and 0.05 mg/kg for MEL in egg powder and soy protein, respectively. For CA, LOD and LOQ were 0.05 and 0.10 mg/kg in egg powder and 1.0 and 1.50 mg/kg in soy protein, respectively. Recoveries ranged within a 97-113% range for both MEL and CA in egg powder and soy protein. Reproducibility values (RSD(R)) from seven laboratories were within a 5.4-11.7% range for both analytes in the considered matrices.

This paper reports a simple method for the preparation of immunoglobulin Y (IgY) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) from hen egg yolk. A water dilution method coupled with (NH4)2SO4 precipitation was employed to prepare the two target proteins. SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) were used to characterize the two products. Western blotting and histobiochemical staining were utilized to qualitatively analyze IgY and HDL, respectively. The purities of prepared IgY and HDL were detected by ELISA and a direct high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol assay, respectively. Results show that dilution times 15 makes IgY and HDL separate well from each other. Western blotting proves IgY has an immunocompetence similar to that of human IgG. Histobiochemical staining shows HDL is composed of sugar, lipid, and protein. The quantitative evaluation of the products indicates that approximately 3 kg of IgY and 2 kg of HDL with purities of 72.7 and 71.9%, respectively, are available from 1 ton of shell eggs via this process.

The method was based on the microextraction of SAs in 300-mg muscle samples with 1 mL of a supramolecular solvent made up of reverse micelles of decanoic acid (DeA) and posterior determination of SAs in the extract by LC/fluorescence detection, after in situ derivatization with fluorescamine. Recoveries were quantitative (98-109%) and matrix-independent, no concentration of the extracts was required, the microextraction took about 30 min and several samples could be simultaneously treated. Formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic groups of the solvent and the target SAs (hydrogen donor and acceptor sum between 9 and 11) were considered as the major forces driving microextraction. The method was validated according to the European Union regulation 2002/657/EC. Analytical performance in terms of linearity, selectivity, trueness, precision, stability of SAs, decision limit and detection capability were determined. Quantitation limits for the different SAs ranged between 12 μg kg(-1) and 44 μg kg(-1), they being nearly independent of matrix composition.

20730647,"The objective of this study was to assess the carry-over of melamine from feed into eggs and body tissues of laying hens. In the first experiment, laying hens were supplied with feed added at 0, 1, 2, 5, 25, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1) of melamine for 21 days followed by a depletion period to observe the residues of melamine in eggs. In a second experiment, laying hens were allocated 0, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1) melamine to determine levels of melamine in body tissues. Melamine and cyanuric acid were simultaneously analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the diet as well as in eggs and body tissue. In the first experiment, melamine appeared in the egg within 24 h after first ingestion of the melamine at 5, 25, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1). Melamine concentration in egg reached a maximum of 2.34 mg kg(-1) within 17 days after exposure of 100 mg kg(-1) melamine, and the carry-over rate for melamine from feed to the eggs was 1.21%. In the second experiment, melamine was detected in tissues within 3 days after exposure; the maximum concentration of melamine residues occurred in the 100 mg kg(-1) group and was as follows: egg (1.83) > kidney (1.21) > breast muscle (0.86) > liver (0.70) > serum (0.42). The melamine level in egg albumen was about twice that of egg yolk. Melamine levels in laying hens decreased rapidly with withdrawal from feed, but melamine only declined to undetectable levels in the egg at day 6 and in tissues at day 4 after last ingestion of 100 mg kg(-1). It can be concluded that a pathway exists for the transmission of melamine from feed to egg and body tissues and the carry-over rate of melamine is low, and that melamine is not metabolized into cyanuric acid in laying hens. A positive relationship exists between exposure levels and eggs or tissues, but no direct relationship between the exposure time and measured levels of melamine in eggs and tissues. The current Chinese limit for melamine in feed and feed material of 2.5 mg kg(-1) established on 8 June 2009 is sufficient to ensure that levels in eggs, breast muscle, liver as well as kidney will not exceed the limit of 2.5 mg kg(-1) in foods other than infant formula introduced by many countries including China.","Food additives & contaminants.

In this study, the dietary intake of heterocyclic amines in Malaysia and their main sources were investigated. Forty-two samples of meat and fish were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector to determine the concentration of the six predominant heterocyclic amines, namely: 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoline(MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx), 2-amino-3,7,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoxaline (7,8-DiMeIQx), and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). Dietary intake data were obtained using a food-frequency questionnaire when interviewing 600 Malaysian respondents. The level of total heterocyclic amines in food samples studies ranged from not detected to 38.7 ng g(-1). The average daily intake level of heterocyclic amine was 553.7 ng per capita day(-1). The intake of PhIP was the highest, followed by MeIQx and MeIQ. The results reveal that fried and grilled chicken were the major dietary source of heterocyclic amines in Malaysia.

Therefore, to develop and validate a sensitive and specific method to detect hidden egg allergens in foods, we compared immunochemical, DNA-based, and proteomic methods for detecting egg allergens in foods using egg allergen standards such as egg whole protein, egg white protein, egg yolk protein, ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin, lysozyme, and alpha-livetin. Protein-based immunochemical methods, including ELISA as an initial screening quantitative analysis and immunoblotting as a final confirmatory qualitative analysis, were very sensitive and specific in detecting potentially allergenic egg residues in processed foods in trace amounts. In contrast, the proteomics-based, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS and LC-tandem quadrupole time-of-flight MS methods were not able to detect some egg allergens, such as ovomucoid, because of its nondenaturing property under urea and trypsin. The DNA-based PCR method could not distinguish between egg and chicken meat because it is tissue-nonspecific.

Twenty-four Hy line hens, aged 26weeks, were orally administered, during 1 or 3 consecutive days, 6mg of a mixture of three PAHs (phenanthrene, pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene) in equal amounts (w:w) or 3mg of lindane per kg body weight daily. Each day, contaminants were administered 1h after oviposition in one gelatin capsule. Eggs were collected daily during the 12d following the first dosing. Concentrations of PAHs and their main hydroxylated metabolites in yolk were determined using HPLC coupled with fluorimetric detection, while lindane was analysed by GC-ED. At the end of the experiment, hens were sacrified and preovulatory yolks were collected and weighed. All three PAHs were recovered in yolks, mainly as metabolites, indicating an active biotransformation of these compounds in hens. Within 10d, PAHs and metabolites concentrations in yolks were back to initial values. However, the recovery rate of these compounds to yolk calculated over the 12-d experiment, was very low, reaching 0.089%, 0.034% and 0.006% for Phe, Pyr and B[a]P, respectively. Daily deposition of yolk and of PAHs and metabolites were found to be directly proportional, indicating that no significant body storage of these PAHs occurred and that they were rapidly hydroxylated after ingestion.

The main objective of this study was to assess the correlation between serum zinc concentrations and dietary zinc intakes with depression scores in university female students. In the first phase, Beck's depression questionnaire was applied in a random sampling of 308 selected 20-25-year-old female students (one third of total students in Ahvaz Jondi-Shapour University of Medical Sciences Golestan dormitories) to assess the major depressive disorder (MDD) scales. Then, in the second phase, 23 students who identified as having moderate and severe depression were selected as the case group, and 23 healthy age matched were chosen as the controls. Each of them completed a 12-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire containing the main food sources of zinc in the usual dietary patterns and also a 24-h food recall questionnaire to assure the daily zinc intakes. Daily zinc intakes were obtained by multiplying each portion size by its zinc content using food tables. A 5-ml blood sample was taken for further serum zinc status using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry technique. Pearson's r was used to show the correlation between quantitative variables. Both daily zinc intake and serum zinc concentrations of MDD group were about two thirds of healthy index (p < 0.01). Depressed individuals used to eat lower servings of red meats and chicken as the main food sources of zinc in students' usual diets (p < 0.001). Consumption of other foods as the sources of zinc was not significantly different in two groups. A linear significant correlation between dietary zinc intakes and its serum levels was seen in samples (r = 0.62; p < 0.001) and MDD students (r = 0.55; p < 0.001). There was a linear inverse correlation between Beck questionnaire scores and serum zinc concentrations in all of the investigated students(r = -0.65; p < 0.001) and MDD girls (r = -0.71; p < 0.001). Beck questionnaire scores and diatary zinc intakes were also inversly correlated (r = -0.58; p < 0.001). However, no statistical correlation was seen between these two variables in MDD cases.

20006112,"Multidimensional analysis of instant coffee and barley beverage samples using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with a dynamic surface tension detector (DSTD) and a UV-vis absorbance detector (UV) is reported. A unique finding of this study was the action of the tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cation as a modifying agent (with bromide as the counter anion) that substantially increased the surface pressure signal and sensitivity of many of the proteins in the chromatographically separated samples. The tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) enhancement of the surface pressure signal was further investigated by studying the response of 12 commercial standard proteins (alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, human serum albumin (HSA), albumin from chicken egg white (OVA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), hemoglobin, alpha-chymotrypsinogen A, cytochrome C, myoglobin, RNase A, carbonic anhydrase, and lysozyme) in buffer performed using flow injection analysis (FIA) coupled with the DSTD with and without various concentrations of TBAB. The FIA-DSTD data show that 1mM TBAB enhances sensitivity of HSA detection, by lowering the limit of detection (LOD) from 2mg/mL to 0.1mg/mL. Similarly, the LOD for BSA was reduced from 1mg/mL to 0.2mg/mL. These FIA-DSTD experiments allowed the detection conditions to be optimized for further SEC-UV/DSTD experiments. Thus, the SEC-UV/DSTD system has been optimized and successfully applied to the selective analysis of surface-active protein fractions in a commercial instant coffee sample and in a soluble barley sample.

This method is simpler and requires fewer reagents when compared with other sample pre-treatment procedures and allows the calibration to be carried out using aqueous standards. Different oily phases such as corn oil, decyl oleate and octyl stearate were tested, as well as Tween 80, Triton X-100 and Triton 114 were analyzed as surfactants. The optimum type and proportion of formulations were determined and their use depended on the element studied. The emulsion preparation was performed by a conventional method that involves mixing both phases at 60 degrees C by magnetic stirring and phase inversion to change the water-to-oil ratio by increasing the volume of the surfactant-water external phase and correspondingly decreasing the volume of internal phase. The accuracy of the method was further confirmed by determining the metals in a whole egg powder CRM and recoveries ranged from 97.5% for Mg to 102.2% for Na, with relative standard deviations lower than 2.3%.

As a result, this chemical and its contaminants or degradation products, such as polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs), may be present in eggs. The litter-to-eggs transfer and depletion of these compounds were studied in a flock of laying hens reared on contaminated wood shavings. PCP determination was carried out via high resolution gas chromatography coupled to low resolution mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (HRGC-LRMS/MS); PCDDs and PCDFs were quantified by HRGC-HRMS (SIM). After substitution of the litter contaminated with PCDDs and PCDFs at an average of 50 pg WHO-TE g(-1) and with PCP at 15 microg g(-1), pooled eggs from six selected hens were sampled twice a month for the depletion study. At steady state, PCDDs and PCDFs showed a transfer ratio of 0.9; for PCP it was 0.03. PCP concentration in eggs (500 ng g(-1) whole weight) fell sharply the second week after exposure withdrawal; for PCDDs and PCDFs (47 pg WHO-TE g(-1) fat, at day 0), the overall TEQ half-life was estimated at an average of 3.8 weeks. Due to differences in toxicokinetics (a faster depletion), PCP does not appear to be a suitable marker of PCDD and PCDF violative levels.

Currently, feather meal is used as an animal feed, given its high protein content, and also as a fertilizer because of its high nitrogen content. In this work, we have extracted fat from the feather meal in boiling water (70 degrees C) and then transesterified the fat into biodiesel using KOH and methanol; 7-11% biodiesel (on a dry basis) is produced in this process. ASTM analysis of the prepared feather meal biodiesel confirmed that the biodiesel is of good quality and comparable to other biodiesels made from other common feedstocks. Given the amount of feather meal produced by the poultry industry, it is estimated that this process can create 150-200 million gallons of biodiesel in the United States and 593.2 million gallons worldwide.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D002849', 'D004736', 'D004951', 'D005223', 'D005227', 'D005241', 'D005511', 'D007220']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Energy-Generating Resources', 'Esterification', 'Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Feathers', 'Food Handling', 'Industrial Waste']",A green process for producing biodiesel from feather meal.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19601661,2009

In the present work, two different approaches for HBCD determination have been optimised and characterised based on their repeatability and intermediate precision, linear calibration ranges, sensitivity, limits of detection and quantification and application to commercial food samples. Both methods involve the use of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to a liquid chromatograph and the addition of different ammonium salts to the mobile phase, i.e. ammonium chloride or ammonium acetate, in order to encourage (Cl method) or try to inhibit (Ac method), respectively, the formation of the chlorine adducts of the molecular ion.

19286018,"In May 2007, investigators discovered that waste material from the pet food manufacturing process contaminated with melamine (MEL) and/or cyanuric acid (CYA) had been added to hog and chicken feeds. At this time, investigators also learned that adulterated wheat gluten had been used in the manufacture of aquaculture feeds. Concern that the contaminated feed had been used in aquaculture and could enter the human food supply prompted the development of a method for the determination of CYA residues in the edible tissues of fish and shrimp. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was employed as a sensitive technique for the analysis of CYA in catfish, tilapia, salmon, trout and shrimp tissue. CYA was extracted from ground fish or shrimp with an acetic acid solution, defatted with hexane, and isolated with a graphitic carbon black solid-phase extraction column. Residues were separated from matrix components using a porous graphitic carbon LC column, and then analyzed with electrospray ionization in negative ion mode on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Selective reaction monitoring was performed on the [M-H](-)m/z 128 ion resulting in the product ions m/z 85 and 42. Recoveries from catfish, tilapia and trout fortified with 10-100 microgkg(-1) of CYA averaged 67% with a relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 18% (n=107). The average method detection limit (MDL) for catfish, tilapia and trout is 3.5 microgkg(-1). An internal standard, (13)C(3)-labeled CYA, was used in the salmon and shrimp extractions. Average recovery of CYA from salmon was 91% (R.S.D.=15%, n=18) with an MDL of 7.4 microgkg(-1).

The MALDI-TOF-MS profiles of crude heterophil extract showed a high intensity peak with average mass of m/z 3916.1 for chicken and m/z 4129.6 for turkey. To identify these peaks, we first purified m/z 3916.1 from chicken bone marrow extract using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Edman sequencing and peptide mass fingerprinting exclusively confirmed this peptide as beta-defensin 2 (BD2) or gallinacin-2, a broad-range antimicrobial peptide. A Uniprot database search followed by the MASCOT sequence query revealed m/z 4129.6 to be the corresponding turkey ortholog of avian beta-defensin 2 (AvBD2), also called turkey heterophil peptide 2. Both AvBD2 peptides are 36 amino acids long including a highly conserved region with 6 invariant cysteines forming the 3 disulfide bonds characteristic of defensins. The method confirmed the existence of the complete mature peptide sequence of the turkey heterophilic BD2 previously proposed based on cDNA analysis.

Developing rapid and cost-effective techniques for identifying pathogens to subspecies is critical for tracking causes of foodborne disease outbreaks. The objective of this study was to develop a method for rapid identification and differentiation of Salmonella serovars and strains within these serovars through isolation on hydrophobic grid membrane filters (HGMFs), examination by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and microspectroscopy, and data analysis by multivariate statistical techniques. Salmonella serovars (Anatum, Enteritidis, Heidelberg, Kentucky, Muenchen, and Typhimurium), most of which were represented by multiple strains, were grown in tryptic soy broth (24 h at 42 degrees C), diluted to 10(2) to 10(3) CFU/ml, and filtered using HGMFs. The membranes were incubated on Miller-Mallinson agar (24 h at 42 degrees C), and typical Salmonella colonies were sonicated in 50% acetonitrile and centrifuged. Resulting pellets were vacuum dried on a ZnSe crystal and analyzed using IR spectroscopy. Alternatively, the membranes containing Salmonella growth were removed from the agar, vacuum dried, and colonies were analyzed directly by IR microspectroscopy. Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) models were developed from spectra. The method was validated by analyzing Salmonella-inoculated tomato juice, eggs, milk, and chicken. Salmonella serovars exhibited distinctive and reproducible spectra in the fingerprint region (1,200 to 900 cm(-1)) of the IR spectrum. SIMCA permitted distinguishing Salmonella strains from each other through differences in bacterial lipopolysaccharides and other membrane components.

In this study, melamine concentration in wheat gluten, chicken feed, and processed foods (that is, cake and noodle) was measured by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in combination with SERS-active substrates. SERS was able to rapidly detect 0.1% melamine in wheat gluten, 0.05% in chicken feed, 0.05% in cakes, and 0.07% in noodle, respectively. A partial least squares (PLS) model was established for the quantification of melamine in foods by SERS: R= 0.90, RMSEP = 0.33. In addition, SERS results were verified by HPLC analysis based on a simplified FDA method. Compared with HPLC, the SERS method is much faster and simpler, requires minimum sample preparation, but still yields satisfactory qualitative and quantitative results. These results demonstrate that it is an applicable approach to use SERS to screen foods, eliminate presumptive negative samples of melamine contamination from the sample population, and then verify presumptive positive samples using HPLC protocols.

18986150,"The effects of cooking processes commonly used by the population of Catalonia (Spain) on total arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) concentrations in various foodstuffs were investigated. All food samples were randomly acquired in local markets, big supermarkets, and grocery stores of Reus (Catalonia). Foods included fish (sardine, hake, and tuna), meat (veal steak, loin of pork, breast and thigh of chicken, and steak and rib of lamb), string bean, potato, rice, and olive oil. For each food item, two composite samples were prepared for metal analyses, whose levels in raw and cooked (fried, grilled, roasted, and boiled) samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The highest concentrations of As, Hg, and Pb (raw and cooked samples) were mainly found in fish, with a clear tendency, in general, to increase metal concentrations after cooking. However, in these samples, Cd levels were very close to their detection limit. In turn, the concentrations of metals in raw and cooked meat samples were detected in all samples (As) or only in a very few samples (Cd, Hg, and Pb). A similar finding corresponded to string beans, rice, and olive oil, while in potatoes, Hg could not be detected and Pb only was detected in the raw samples. In summary, the results of the present study show that, in general terms, the cooking process is only of a very limited value as a means of reducing metal concentrations.

24784535,"Samples of vegetables and cereals from Egypt were screened for 113 pesticides, of which 68 were quantified, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with limits of detection (LODs) ranging from 0.02 to 1.9 µg kg⁻¹. In addition, the residues of 17 non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs) were measured in samples of animal origin (meat, dairy products and seafood) using high-resolution gas chromatography (HRGC)/high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS). None of the cereal samples and 72.7% of the vegetables contained any detectable levels of the pesticides. Detectable residues, not exceeding the current European Union maximum residue limits (MRLs) were found in 27.3% of vegetables. The estimated daily intake for detected pesticides was well below their corresponding acceptable daily intake (ADI), with exposure ranges between 0.002% of the ADI for profenofos and 0.2% of the ADI for lambda-cyhalothrin. The sum concentration of 17 PCBs congeners varied between 2.5 and 322 ng g⁻¹ fat, corresponding to 1.7-216 ng g⁻¹ fat for the seven indicator PCBs. The highest values were measured in seafood, the lowest in dairy products. Hexa-CB 153, 138 and hepta-CB180 were the congeners with the highest contribution. PCBs congener profiles found in most of the samples were consistent with the expected profile for Aroclor 1260 and 1262. PCBs' contamination levels reported in this paper were many times lower than in developed countries, except for chicken samples. Also, the dietary intake of seven indicator PCBs due to the consumption of food of animal origin (4.84 ng kg⁻¹ body weight day⁻¹) from Ismailia city, Egypt, is several times lower than the intake in European Union countries.","Food additives & contaminants.

Elution was by a linear gradient of propan-2-ol in an acidic phosphate buffer system containing 0.7 M NaCl (pH 2.4). Biotin was derivatized with 9-anthryldiazomethane (ADAM) to the fluorescent biotin-ADAM ester and a linear calibration line was obtained from 0 to 1.39 pmol with a detection limit of 69.5 fmol. Biotin was measured after hydrolysis in 2.25 M sulphuric acid for 1h at 120 degrees C and the recovery for biocytin was 65.7+/-2.53%, and hence a correction factor of 1.52 was used for the total biotin analysis. The recovery of added biotin from the serum was more than 98% using this correction factor of 1.52. Biotin was also measured in nutritional supplemental foods and foodstuffs, and we found that chicken egg yolk, ""natto"", rice bran, royal jelly, and dried yeast contained highest levels of biotin. Biotin was also found in ferments by Bacillus natto, yeast, and some acetic acid bacterium. Storage foods such as beans, nuts and eggs also contained abundant biotin. Biotin was also determined and replacement monitored in the serum of suspected biotinidase deficiency patients. This affinity-chromatographic method for biotin determination was shown to be a robust and reliable and is well suited for biochemical and nutritional research.","Journal of chromatography.

The plasma levels of testosterone (T) and estradiol-17beta (E2) was measured by radioimmunoassay in the catfish Rita rita captured from unpolluted reference site and polluted river Gomti during prespawning phase. Results indicated that in R. rita the SigmaDDT, SigmaHCH, endosulfan, aldrin, chlorpyrifos in blood levels were in preferential order (SigmaDDT>SigmaHCH>endosulfan>aldrin>chlorpyrifos) of their bioaccumulation. The blood levels of SigmaHCH and SigmaDDT also showed high levels in chick, goat and man, and preferential order of bioaccumulation was goat>chick>man>fish. The SigmaDDT also showed preferential order (man>chick>goat>fish) of bioaccumulation. Among the different tissues of fish (blood, liver, brain and ovary) the SigmaDDT was very high as compared to SigmaHCH as well as the rest of tissues which was very selective bioconcentration in different tissues of fish during prespawning phase. The gonado-somatic index, T and E2 declined in the catfish captured from polluted river when compared with the catfish captured from reference site affecting reproductive physiology.

The finding of sources of semicarbazide (SEM), other than through the misuse of nitrofurazone, present a challenge to the use of SEM as a definitive marker residue for this drug. Detection of intact (parent) nitrofurazone would avoid confusion over the source of SEM residues. Broiler chickens were fed sub-therapeutic nitrofuran-containing diets and their tissues were analysed for parent compounds and metabolites by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS). Depletion half-lives in muscle were longer for tissue-bound metabolite residues, 3.4 days --3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ), 3-amino-5-morpholinomethyl-2-oxazolidone (AMOZ) -- to 4.5 days (SEM), than total metabolite residues, 2.0 days (AOZ) to 3.2 days (SEM). Metabolite concentrations were higher in eyes than in muscle. Metabolite half-lives in eyes ranged from 8.5 days (1-aminohydantoin (AHD)) to 20.3 days (SEM). Nitrofuran parent compounds were also detected in eyes. Furaltadone was detected in single eyes after 21 days' withdrawal of a 6 mg kg(-1) furaltadone diet. When 50 eyes from broilers containing metabolites in muscle close to the 1 microg kg(-1) minimum required performance level (MRPL) were pooled into single samples, 1.2 ng of furazolidone and 31.1 ng of furaltadone were detected, but nitrofurazone was not detected due to the long depletion half-life of SEM in muscle.

18221829,"Zearalenone (ZEA), a widely distributed oestrogenic fusariotoxin, constitutes a potential risk for human and animal health. ZEA is metabolised to the main metabolites identified in vitro and in vivo: alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZOL) and beta-zearalenol (beta-ZOL). The efficiency to produce alpha-reduced metabolites appears of particular interest in risk assessment as alpha-reduced metabolites constitute activated forms whereas beta-reduced metabolites are less oestrogenic than ZEA. In this study ZEA activation was compared in avian food species. ZEA and its reduced metabolites were quantified in subcellular fractions of six avian species and rat livers. The alpha-ZOL/beta-ZOL ratio in rats was 19. The various avian food species cannot be considered to be equivalent in terms of ZEA reduction (P<0.001). Quails represented high ""beta reducers"", with alpha-ZOL/beta-ZOL ratio less than two.

18213472,"To determine sulphamethazine (SMZ) residues in edible animal foods (pig muscle, chicken muscle, egg, fish, milk and liver), a competitive direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a colloidal gold immunoassay were established. The limits of detection of the ELISA and the colloidal gold immunoassay were 0.02 and 0.5 microg kg(-1), respectively. The specificity of the ELISA developed to the SMZ was high according to the results of cross-reactivity testing with 14 kinds of sulphonamides. To obtain a more sensitive immunoassay, buffer solution (30 mmol L(-1) phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.5) was optimized through the whole test procedure. A simple and efficient extraction method for the rapid detection of SMZ residues in foods was developed, with recoveries between 74 and 117.5%. Matrix effects can be avoided by 1:10 dilution of pig muscle, chicken muscle, egg, fish, milk and liver with optimal buffer. The detection limit of SMZ was 5 microg kg(-1) in liver and 2 microg kg(-1) in the other five samples. For the validation of the ELISA tests, sample extracts were analysed by ELISA and high-performance liquid chromatography. The results obtained by these two methods showed a good correlation (r(2)) which was greater than 0.9.

17980142,"Whereas the bearing of mass measurement error on protein identification is sometimes underestimated, uncertainty in observed peptide masses unavoidably translates to ambiguity in subsequent protein identifications. Although ongoing instrumental advances continue to make high accuracy mass spectrometry (MS) increasingly accessible, many proteomics experiments are still conducted with rather large mass error tolerances. In addition, the ranking schemes of most protein identification algorithms do not include a meaningful incorporation of mass measurement error. This article provides a critical evaluation of mass error tolerance as it pertains to false positive peptide and protein associations resulting from peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) database searching. High accuracy, high resolution PMFs of several model proteins were obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTICR-MS). Varying levels of mass accuracy were simulated by systematically modulating the mass error tolerance of the PMF query and monitoring the effect on figures of merit indicating the PMF quality. Importantly, the benefits of decreased mass error tolerance are not manifest in Mowse scores when operating at tolerances in the low parts-per-million range but become apparent with the consideration of additional metrics that are often overlooked. Furthermore, the outcomes of these experiments support the concept that false discovery is closely tied to mass measurement error in PMF analysis. Clear establishment of this relation demonstrates the need for mass error-aware protein identification routines and argues for a more prominent contribution of high accuracy mass measurement to proteomic science.",Analytical biochemistry,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D016172', 'D004531', 'D006454', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D010047', 'D010455', 'D011336', 'D011506', 'D012680', 'D017550']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'Eggs', 'Hemoglobins', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Ovalbumin', 'Peptides', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared']",Systematic characterization of high mass accuracy influence on false discovery and probability scoring in peptide mass fingerprinting.,"[None, None, 'Q000592', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000235', None, None]","[None, None, 'standards', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'genetics', 'chemistry', None, 'genetics', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17980142,2008

17704396,"To decrease dioxin uptake by the general population the European Union (EU) has set limits to the dioxin content of many foodstuffs including eggs. Eggs from free foraging chickens are known to have a higher dioxin content compared with confined laying hens, and the question is whether these eggs can adhere to current EU regulations. The aim of the study was to investigate parameters that are involved in the contamination of eggs from chickens raised under organic conditions. Samples from 34 organic farms including soil and earthworm samples were collected between September and December of the year 2003. Dioxin levels were assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Various parameters were collected by on farm interviews. Egg dioxin content varied between 0.4 and 8.1 pg of toxic equivalents (TEQ)/g of egg fat with a mean of 2.2 pg of TEQ/g of egg fat. Nine out of 34 farms exceeded the EU limit of 3 pg of TEQ/g of egg fat. In addition, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCB) were measured, and 8 samples exceeded the limit for the sum of dioxins and DL-PCB. Overall, egg samples from 10 farms were noncompliant with the dioxin or total TEQ limits. No statistically significant relation could be observed between egg dioxin levels and the concentration observed in soil or earthworms. A statistically significant association was observed between flock size and egg dioxin and DL-PCB content. This effect is most likely attributable to the fact that flock size is related to the time chickens spend outside. Restricting outdoor run use on one of the farms resulted in a decrease of the egg dioxin content to a level that was within the EU limits. This demonstrates that the most likely contamination source is the soil or soil organisms but that the behavior of the hens determines the extent of the contamination. Following the completion of this study, a dioxin monitoring protocol has been set up in the Netherlands to prevent marketing of eggs with raised dioxin levels.",Poultry science,"['D000821', 'D000822', 'D000818', 'D002645', 'D003430', 'D004147', 'D004531', 'D005260', 'D005506', 'D010063', 'D011078', 'D012989']","['Animal Feed', 'Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dioxins', 'Eggs', 'Female', 'Food Contamination', 'Ovum', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Soil Pollutants']",Effect of flock size on dioxin levels in eggs from chickens kept outside.,"[None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'methods', None, 'physiology', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17704396,2007

Higher levels of BaP were detected in fried chicken (5.25-5.55 BaP microg/kg) and smoked dried beef (5.47 microg/kg) compared to relatively lower levels measured in sesame oil (0.36 microg/kg) and peanut (0.44 microg/kg). The BaP levels in nonmeat items were generally low in detection, but certain potato chip products showed levels up to 4.06 BaP microg/kg. In terms of chronic daily intake of BaP, fried chicken was shown to be the highest (70.09 ng/person/d) and perilla oil was the lowest (0.05 ng/person/d). The total daily intake of BaP due to the consumption of various food items investigated was estimated to be 124.55 ng/person/d, based on daily food consumption and the contaminant level of BaP. The dietary BaP-related cancer risk using carcinogenic potency factor of BaP as 7.3E + 0 (mg/kg/d)(-1) was assessed to be 1.52 x 10(-5).

The samples were separated into domestic and imported products in order to investigate the sources of contamination. PCDFs were the more dominant congeners in domestic beef and were similar to those found from emission of incineration. However, the congener profiles of domestic beef and incineration were difficult to compare because the environmental fate and animal metabolism were involved.

The maximum value was observed in samples packaged under air, and the minimum value was observed under a modified atmosphere mixture of 60% CO2-40% N2. In this group, the maximum acrylamide concentration was reached after 19 days of storage. These data indicate that there is a high concentration of acrylamide in precooked, battered protein foods and that the concentration changes considerably during storage, which may lead to almost twice the initial amounts when air is present within the package.",Journal of food protection,"['D020106', 'D000818', 'D002645', 'D002851', 'D003257', 'D005511', 'D005516', 'D018857', 'D005519', 'D006801', 'D009584', 'D010100', 'D011202', 'D013696', 'D013997', 'D014618']","['Acrylamide', 'Animals', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Consumer Product Safety', 'Food Handling', 'Food Microbiology', 'Food Packaging', 'Food Preservation', 'Humans', 'Nitrogen', 'Oxygen', 'Poultry Products', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Vacuum']",Effect of processing and storage conditions on the generation of acrylamide in precooked breaded chicken products.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","['analysis', None, None, 'methods', None, 'methods', None, 'methods', 'methods', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17340884,2007

17164214,"Nitrofuran antibiotics have been banned for use in food-producing animals in many countries, including the European Union, owing to the threat they pose to human health. Research continues into the accumulation of these drugs in animal tissues and into the appropriate methods for their detection. In this study, an LC-MS/MS method is presented for the detection of the parent compounds, furazolidone, nitrofurantoin, furaltadone and nitrofurazone, in eggs. The parent compounds are first extracted into ethyl acetate, fats are removed by partition between acetonitrile and hexane, and the concentrated sample is analysed by LC-MS/MS. Decision limits (CCalpha) for the parents were < or =1 microg kg-1 for all four compounds. Within-day and between-day CVs are well within the limits stated in Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The method provides an alternative to the testing of side-chain metabolites in eggs, which is particularly important in the case of nitrofurazone, where semicarbazide contamination of food has been attributed to sources other than nitrofurazone use. This method was used together with a method for the detection of the side-chain metabolite compounds, 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ), 3-amino-5-morpholinomethyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one (AMOZ), 1-amino-hydantoin (AHD) and semicarbazide (SEM), to study the accumulation and distribution of nitrofurans in eggs. Eggs were collected from four groups of hens that had been treated with one of the nitrofurans at a feed concentration of 300 mg kg-1 for 1 week. Parent compounds and metabolites were found in the yolk, albumen and shell. Albumen/yolk ratios for the parent compounds were 0.7, 0.82, 0.83 and 0.31 for furazolidone, furaltadone, nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone, respectively. Ratios for the side-chain metabolites were 1.02, 1.06, 0.83 and 0.55 for AOZ, AMOZ, AHD and SEM, respectively. However, 50% of the total SEM residues were found in eggshell.

Lower-quality feeds given to chickens may be contaminated with T-2 toxin, which may affect their health. The literature suggests that T-2 toxin is transmitted from the hen to the eggs. This article describes the development of a liquid chromatographic assay for T-2 and the related mycotoxin HT-2 in eggs. T-2 and HT-2 toxins were isolated from spiked eggs with a tandem charcoal-alumina-Florisil column and immunoaffinity column cleanup.

The limit of detection of the method was 1 ng ml(-1) (parts per billion) of T-2 and HT-2 in whole (with shell removed) eggs. The limit of quantitation for both toxins was 5 ng ml(-1). Recoveries from spiked eggs over the range from 5 to 50 ng ml(-1) averaged 89.2% for T-2 and 100.3% for HT-2, with coefficients of variation of 3.5 and 8.2%, respectively.

Methods This paper analysed the effect of cooking on the retinol levels of free-range and caged hen eggs, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The retinol levels of hen and quail eggs were also compared. Results The raw egg yolk retinol concentrations of free-range and caged hen eggs were 476.53+/-39.44 and 474.93+/-41.10 microg/100 g and cooked egg yolk concentrations were 393.53+/-24.74 and 379.01+/-30.78 microg/100 g, respectively; quail egg concentration was 636.56+/-32.71 microg retinol/100 g. No significant difference was found between the retinol of free-range and caged hen egg yolks; however, cooking diminished retinol levels, causing a loss of 17 and 20% in the free-range and caged hen egg yolks, respectively. Quail egg retinol concentration was significantly higher than that of the hens.

These materials are currently disposed of in landfills and could potentially have a negative impact on the effective function of microbes that are intolerant of acidic conditions. A study was undertaken using three different sources of acid waste bentonites, namely soybean oil bentonite (SB), palm oil bentonite (PB), and rice bran oil bentonite (RB). These materials were co-composted with rice husk, rice husk ash, and chicken litter to eliminate their acid reactivity and hydrophobic nature. The organic carbon (OC) content, pH, exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the acid-activated bentonites increased significantly after the co-composting phase. In addition, the hydrophobic nature of these materials as measured using the water drop penetration time (WDPT) decreased from >10 800 s to 16 to 80 s after composting. Furthermore, these composted materials showed positive impacts on soil physical attributes including specific surface area, bulk density, and available water content for crop growth. Highly significant increases in maize biomass (Zea mays L.) production over two consecutive cropping cycles was observed in treatments receiving co-composted bentonite. The study clearly demonstrates the potential for converting an environmentally hazardous material into a high-quality soil conditioner using readily available agricultural byproducts.

The widespread use of malathion has raised concern over its potential to cause untoward health effects in humans, animals and birds. Malathion inhibits cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and has the potential to alter pharmacokinetic profiles of therapeutic agents that are metabolized in the liver. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of subchronic exposure of malathion on the pharmacokinetic disposition of pefloxacin. Chickens were given either normal diet or malathion through food at a concentration of 1000ppm for 28 days. Subsequently, pefloxacin was administered either intravenously or orally (control) to birds fed normal diet and orally to malathion-exposed chickens at a dosage of 10mgkg(-1) body weight. Blood samples were drawn from the brachial vein at predetermined time intervals after drug administration. Plasma was separated and analyzed for pefloxacin by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The plasma concentration-time data were analyzed by non-compartmental techniques.

Mean concentrations of lead and cadmium were 6.94 and 1.68 microg kg(-1) in chicken meat, 5.00 and 5.49 microg kg(-1) in pork meat, 1.91 and 1.90 microg kg(-1) in beef meat and 1.35 and 1.22 microg kg(-1) in lamb meat samples, respectively. Lead was below the detection limit in turkey samples and mean cadmium concentration was 5.49 microg kg(-1). Mean concentrations of lead and cadmium in chicken meat product samples were 3.16 and 4.15 microg kg(-1), 4.89 and 6.50 microg kg(-1) in pork meat product, 6.72 and 4.76 microg kg(-1) in beef meat product and 9.12 and 5.98 microg kg(-1) in turkey meat product samples, respectively. The percentage contribution of the two considered metals to provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) was calculated for meat and meat products. Statistically significant differences were found for lead content in meats between the chicken and pork groups and the turkey and beef groups, whereas for cadmium concentrations in meats, significant differences were observed between the turkey and chicken, beef and lamb groups.

In meat-based samples, the levels of 7-ketocholesterol and 7-ketositosterol were 22-89 and 11-40 microg/serving, respectively, whereas the cholestanetriol levels were 7-38 microg/serving. The 7-ketocholesterol/cholesterol percent ratio was characteristic of each kind of meat and related to the levels of unsaturated fatty acids of animal lipids. In fish-based samples, the cholestanetriol and 7-ketocholesterol levels per serving were significantly lower than in meat samples, but in fish fillets they were about 20-25%, instead of 40%, of the ingredients. The values of the 7-ketocholesterol/cholesterol percent ratio in fish-based products were close to the values computed for chicken or turkey-based products.

The final acrylamide extract was analyzed by GC-ECD for quantification and by GC-MS for confirmation. The chromatographic analysis was performed on the HP-INNOWax capillary column, and good retention and peak response of acrylamide were achieved under the optimal conditions (numbers of theoretical plates N = 83,815). The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 0.1 microg kg(-1) on the basis of ECD technique.

16278935,"Ergot alkaloids are mycotoxins generated by grass and grain pathogens such as Claviceps, for example. Ergot alkaloid-poisoning syndromes, such as tall fescue toxicosis from endophyte-infected tall fescue grass, are important veterinary problems for cattle, horses, sheep, pigs and chickens, with consequent impact on food, meat and dairy industries. Damage to livestock is of the order of a billion dollars a year in the United States alone. HPLC with UV and fluorescence detection are the predominant means of ergot alkaloid determination, with focus on quantitation of the marker compound ergovaline, although ELISA methods are undergoing investigation. These techniques are excellent for rapid detection, but of poor specificity in defining new or poorly characterized ergot alkaloids and related compounds. This paper demonstrates the facility of using electrospray(+) mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection during chromatographic examination of ergot alkaloid standards of lysergic acid, lysergol, ergonovine, ergovaline, ergotamine, ergocornine, ergocryptine and ergocrystine by HPLC. Ergoline-8 position epimers could be separated on the gradient HPLC system for ergocornine, ergocrystine and ergonovine and appeared as shoulders for ergotamine and ergovaline; epimers generally showed different patterns of relative intensity for specific MRM transitions. There was reasonable correspondence between retention of standards on the 2-mm ESI(+)MS phenyl-hexyl-based reverse phase column and those on the 4-mm C18-based column. Since up to 10% of clinical cases involving toxin exposure display unidentified chromatographic peaks, 11 samples of feed components associated with such cases were studied with developed MRM methods to attempt elucidation of crucial components if possible. Ergotamine appeared in all, ergovaline appeared in five and ergocornine appeared in six; ergonovine, ergocryptine, ergocrystine and lysergol also appeared in several. In addition, molecular weights of compounds newly revealed by mass spectrometry suggested ergosine, ergostine and ergoptine in four samples, for which standards were not available. Dehydrated products of ergotamine, ergocrystine and ergocornine were discovered, along with dihydrogenated ergocrystine and ergocryptine in seven of the samples, and the issue was raised as to whether dehydration was strictly an instrument-derived artifact. Finally, five of the samples, along with fescue seed standard, evidenced one or more of 14 new ergot alkaloids ranging in size from 381 to 611 molecular weight and with key mass spectral characteristics of ergot alkaloids, specifically the pair of peaks m/z 223 and 208, corresponding to the ergoline ring system and its demethylated variant, respectively.

Dietary meat consumption data (g/day), including meat type and cooking method, were gathered from food-frequency questionnaires completed by 497 randomly sampled Chinese men and women aged 20-59 yr.

The GC-MS data also showed a decrease in 2-furancarboxaldehyde, which could indicate loss of Maillard type components often associated with acidic or meat odor and flavor. The fluorescence spectra were difficult to interpret, probably due to the simultaneous influence from increasing levels of lipid oxidation products and loss of fluorescent Maillard or spice components.

For the analysis, multidimensional high-resolution gas chromatography using a chiral column coated with randomly silylated heptakis(O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-beta-cyclodextrin, electron capture detection, and valveless ""live column switching"" technique was applied. The analytical results were additionally confirmed with mass spectral data, recorded in electron-capture negative ionization mode with selected-ion monitoring mass spectrometry. During both the feeding period of the laying hens with toxaphene-contaminated food (38 weeks, accumulation phase) and the following subsiding period without toxaphenes (another 14 weeks, decontamination phase), organs (liver, kidney, skin/fat), blood, meat, and eggs of the hens served as model matrices for toxaphene uptake. The enantiomeric ratios (ERs) of congeners 26, 31, 32, 40, 41, 42(a+b), 44, 50, and 62--known as the most important components of technical toxaphene occurring in the environment--could be analytically determined. Significant differences were observed with respect to their initial racemic ratios. On the basis of their chemical structures, the metabolic pathways of some congeners could be explained. Astonishingly, some of the toxaphenes applied as racemates could merely be found as single enantiomers at the end of the feeding program, for example, congener 32 in blood and meat samples or congener 44, especially in organ tissues, which showed ERs of zero or infinity.

15764290,"Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) are produced during cooking of proteinaceous food such as meat and fish. Humans eating a normal diet are regularly exposed to these food-borne substances. HAAs have proved to be carcinogenic in animals and to induce early lesions in the development of cancer. DNA adduct levels in mouse liver have been measured by 32P-HPLC after oral administration each of 14 different HAAs. The highest DNA adduct levels were detected for 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]-indole (Trp-P-2), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AalphaC), respectively. To assess a relative risk in a human population, a relative risk index was calculated by combining the DNA adduct levels in mouse liver with human daily intake of heterocyclic amines in a US and in a Swedish population. Such calculations suggest that AalphaC presents the highest risk for humans, e.g. nine-fold higher compared with the most abundant amines in food, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]-pyridine (PhIP). Therefore, the distribution of DNA adducts in different tissues of mouse was investigated after oral administration of AalphaC. The highest AalphaC-DNA adduct levels were found in liver (137 adducts/10(8) normal nucleotides) followed by heart, kidney, lung, large intestine, small intestine, stomach and spleen, in descending order. To characterize the chemical structure of the major DNA adduct, chemical synthesis was performed. The major DNA adduct from the in vivo experiments was characterized by five different methods. On the basis of these results, the adduct was characterized as N2-(deoxyguanin-8-yl)-2-amino-9H-pyrido [2,3-b]indole. Considering the abundance of AalphaC not only in grilled meat, but also in other products like grilled chicken, vegetables and cigarette smoke and in light of the results of the present study, it is suggested that the human cancer risk for AalphaC might be underestimated.","Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals","['D000284', 'D000588', 'D000818', 'D014408', 'D002243', 'D002273', 'D002851', 'D002855', 'D004247', 'D018736', 'D004305', 'D006801', 'D007093', 'D008297', 'D008460', 'D051379', 'D009153', 'D009369', 'D012306', 'D013053', 'D013997', 'D014018', 'D014466']","['Administration, Oral', 'Amines', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carbolines', 'Carcinogens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'DNA', 'DNA Adducts', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles', 'Male', 'Meat', 'Mice', 'Mutagens', 'Neoplasms', 'Risk', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Ultraviolet Rays']","DNA adduct formation of 14 heterocyclic aromatic amines in mouse tissue after oral administration and characterization of the DNA adduct formed by 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AalphaC), analysed by 32P_HPLC.","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000139', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'methods', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemically induced', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15764290,2005

Apparent faecal PCB digestibility and apparent retention were not influenced by dietary levels of added fat varying between 1.5% and 4.5%, but were significantly higher in hens fed diets containing added PCBs. Moreover, apparent PCB digestibility and retention increased significantly with age. Among the seven individual PCB congeners, no systematically significant differences with regard to apparent faecal digestibility were observed throughout the experiment.

The carbohydrase supplement contained xylanase, glucanase, cellulase, and other enzyme activities. The experimental diets were formulated to be suboptimal in major nutrients and each was fed in a mash form to 10 replicate pens of 5 broilers per pen. Body weight gain was not affected by fat type but a poorer feed/gain ratio (P < 0.001) was noted for tallow-containing diets. Regardless of fat type, carbohydrase enzyme supplementation improved (P < 0.001) BW gain and feed/gain ratio. There was no effect of lipase addition on chicken performance and nutrient utilization. When compared with canola oil, tallow-containing diets had a lower (P < 0.001) apparent fat digestibility and consequently a lower dietary AMEn content. Carbohydrase enzyme addition improved (P < 0.001) fat, starch, nitrogen, and nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) digestibilities in the small intestine, improved AMEn, and reduced (P < 0.001) jejunal digesta viscosity in both fat types. Carbohydrase supplementation increased water-soluble (P < 0.001) and decreased water-insoluble (P < 0.001) NSP concentrations in the small intestine. The interaction between fat type and carbohydrase addition was only significant for fat digestibilities, with greater improvements seen for diets containing tallow. Significant interactions between carbohydrase addition and intestinal segment were noted for fat, starch, nitrogen, and NSP digestibilities, with the enzyme effects being greater in the jejunum than the ileum.

Four groups of laying hens (eight in each group) were fed a diet that included differing amounts of naturally contaminated wheat containing DON ( approximately 20 mg kg(-1)) and ZON (0.5 mg kg(-1)). Eggs were collected and pooled from each group on a daily basis. Pooled samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS). The method allowed DON, other type B trichothecenes, ZON, and its metabolites to be determined in a single multi-residue analysis. The selectivity of the MS/MS procedure allowed cleanup to be minimized (for DON, cleanup by immunoaffinity column was used) or eliminated (for ZON). The limits of detection of 0.01 microg kg(-1) for DON and 0.1 microg kg(-1) for ZON in eggs were lower than previously published methods. None of the samples analyzed had detectable levels of ZON or its metabolites. Although maximum levels of DON contamination (10 mg kg(-1) feed) were relatively high, no adverse effects were observed on egg production.

An effective multi-residue method is presented for the simultaneous determination of certain sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline) and TMP in products of animal origin (chicken muscle, fish muscle and eggs) by liquid chromatographymass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) at levels in compliance with the legislation in force. The drugs were extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane/acetone (1:1, v/v) and clean-up was carried out by solid phase extraction (SPE) on a sulfonic acid column after addition of acetic acid to the extract, so as to allow for ionexchange. Sulfonamides and TMP were then eluted from the SPE column using a solution of ammonia in methanol. The chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column by using a mobile phase of methanol/5 mM aqueous ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid in gradient, and the LC-MS/MS analysis was performed in a triplequadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a TurboIonSpray source and operated in positive ion mode. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) approach was adopted for the identification and quantification of the molecules of concern and was applied by selecting three specific diagnostic ions (one precursor ion and two product ions) for each analyte, so as to meet the criteria set by the EU both for the minimum required number of identification points and for the ion intensity ratio tolerances. Calculated detection limits for sulfonamides (signal/noise ratio 3:1) ranged from 0.1 microg to 1.7 microg/kg, whereas the recovery rates varied between 69.5% and 94.2% throughout the different compounds and matrices. The corresponding values for TMP ranged from 0.2 microg to 0.4 microg/kg and between 51.9% and 52.8%, according to the matrix. The easy sample preparation procedure and the specific and selective mass spectrometric detection make the present method reliable and suitable for the unambiguous identification and quantitation of the analytes taken into account in chicken, fish muscle and eggs. Moreover, method application has successfully extended to other sulfonamides, such as sulfaguanidine, sulfapyridine, sulfamoxole and sulfamethizole.",Veterinaria italiana,[],[],"Determination of some sulfonamides and trimethoprim in chicken, fish muscle and eggs by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20437390,2012

All of the products tested were household cooked. The HAs were analysed in the selected meat dishes using an analytical method based on solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. DMIP, MeIQx, 4,8-DiMeIQx, Norharman, Harman, PhIP, Trp-P-1, AalphaC and MeAalphaC were the amines most frequently found at concentrations of up to 47 ng g(-1) of cooked meat. Glu-P-2, IQ, MeIQ, Glu-P-1, 7,8-DiMeIQx and Trp-P-2 were only found in a few of the meat dishes and their concentrations were lower than 1 ng g(-1) of cooked meat. The highest amounts of HAs, especially PhIP and DMIP, were formed in fried chicken breast and the lowest were formed in fried beef hamburger and in fried pork sausages.

15035993,"Heterocyclic amines (HAs) are an important class of food mutagens and carcinogens, which can be found in cooked meat and fish. Increasing heating temperatures and times usually increase mutagenic activity in meat and meat extracts during cooking. We developed a model system, which allows to examine the effects of precursor composition and heating conditions (time and temperature) on the formation of HAs in meat. Homogenized and freeze dried meat samples (beef, pork chops, chicken breast and turkey breast) are heated with diethylene glycol in closed vials under stirring in a thermostated heating block. After an appropriate sample preparation (extraction and clean-up) ten different HAs were measured by HPLC analyses with gradient elution and mass selective detection. The time courses of HA-formation in the different kinds of meat at varying heating temperatures were determined up to heating times of 30 min. 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) was the most abundant HA in these experiments and reached the highest concentrations in the beef meat samples, as did the other HAs (MeIQ, AalphaC) at 220 degrees C in the heating block under stirred conditions. Additionally the influence of the antioxidant TBHQ (t-butylhydroquinone) on the formation of HAs in the model system was tested.

After May 2003, such cases decreased until no more reports of Brazilian chicken contamination with this nitrofuran were reported. Curiously, after April 2003, an increase was observed in the numbers of contaminated samples by semicarbazide, the target metabolite of nitrofurazone. Most Brazilian chicken found to be contaminated with semicarbazide has been covered with flour, salt and spices.

Laboratory-cooked beef, pork, and chicken are capable of producing tens of nanograms of MeIQx, IFP, and PhIP per gram of meat and smaller amounts of other heteroyclic amines. Well-done restaurant-cooked beef, pork, and chicken may contain PhIP and IFP at concentrations as high as tens of nanograms per gram and MeIQx at levels up to 3 ng/g. Although well-done chicken breast prepared in the laboratory may contain large amounts of PhIP, a survey of flame-grilled meat samples cooked in private homes showed PhIP levels in beef steak and chicken breast are not significantly different (P=0.36). The extremely high PhIP levels reported in some studies of grilled chicken are not seen in home-cooked samples.Many studies suggest individuals may have varying susceptibility to carcinogens and that diet may influence metabolism, thus affecting cancer susceptibility. To understand the human metabolism of PhIP, we examined urinary metabolites of PhIP in volunteers following a single well-done meat exposure. Using solid-phase extraction and LC/MS/MS, we quantified four major PhIP metabolites in human urine. In addition to investigating individual variation, we examined the interaction of PhIP with a potentially chemopreventive food. In a preliminary study of the effect of broccoli on PhIP metabolism, we fed chicken to six volunteers before and after eating steamed broccoli daily for 3 days. Preliminary results suggest that broccoli, which contains isothiocyanates shown to induce Phases I and II metabolism in vitro, may affect both the rate of metabolite excretion and the metabolic products of a dietary carcinogen.

12180676,"A sensitive, specific, and reliable liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for detection and identification of zeranol in chicken or rabbit liver. A homogenized liver sample was hydrolyzed with beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase, and the hydrolysate was extracted with ethyl ether. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in chloroform and re-extracted with sodium hydroxide. After acidification, the extract was cleaned up on a C18 solid-phase extraction cartridge and analyzed by electrospray LC-MS/MS in the negative ion mode. The multiple reaction monitoring transition from both m/z 321 to 277 and m/z 321 to 303 was monitored for confirmation, and the product ion of 277 was used for quantitation.

11763080,"A method using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) with electrospray (ES) for the determination of traces of narasin, monensin and salinomycin in chicken liver and eggs was developed, validated and used for routine surveillance. The essence of this paper is to demonstrate that one single method can serve very well for two entirely different purposes, i.e., screening and confirmation. Highly reliable confirmation of the identity at low concentrations was demonstrated when residues of narasin were detected and quantified (0.2 to 11 ng g(-1)) in 50% of the Swedish eggs analysed in 1999. Four daughter ions were detected with ion ratios meeting suggested confirmation criteria for the European Union, even at 0.2 ng g(-1). The method was found to be highly cost-effective since both screening and confirmation of 98 liver samples were performed in only two analytical runs (the Swedish national surveillance scheme of 1999, report level 5 ng g(-1)). The high performance of the method for the different applications was possible due to a combination of the power of ES-LC-MS-MS, a procedure involving screening of pooled samples, and method optimisation of the work-up (automated solid phase extraction), LC and MS parameters. Validation data for narasin (0.5 to 20 ng g(-1)) in eggs are presented (accuracy 94 to 108%, relative standard deviation 4 to 10%, limit of detection 0.026 ng g(-1)).

The purpose of this study was to characterize the major allergens in Bird's Nest by using the combined technologies of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), immunochemistry, N-terminal protein sequencing, and mass spectrometry. Results from the immunostaining of the Western blots of the Bird's Nest 2-DE separated proteins with the sera from allergic patients indicated the presence of a major allergen of 66 kDa.

DDT was extracted by use of a modified soxhlet apparatus and analysis was performed by gas chromatography with electron capture detector. The results show that, in 1997, soil samples contained up to 351 microg x kg(-1) x d x w. of summation operator DDT near the insecticide-sprayed sites. In 1999, the soil concentration decreased to 112 microg x kg(-1) x d x w. of summation operator DDT. Sediments from small creeks also showed low concentrations (up to 32.9 microg x kg(-1) x d x w. of summation operator DDT).

11417661,"The 2-alkylcyclobutanone method was adopted as a European Standard (EN1785) and MAFF Validated Method (MAFF V37) in 1996 for the detection of irradiated food containing fat. As the method requires a relatively long period (ca 2 days) of time for extraction of the 2-alkylcyclobutanones from a foodstuff, a means was sought to increase the speed at which these irradiation markers could be isolated while at the same time decreasing the amount of organic solvents required. Thus, the technique of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was investigated. Results showed that SFE can be used for the rapid extraction (60 min) of lipid from irradiated foods such as chicken, pork, liquid whole egg, ground beef, and from the seeds of irradiated mango and papaya with only 10 mL n-hexane being necessary for collection of the extracted sample. A method was also developed whereby the 2-alkylcyclobutanones can be selectively extracted from irradiated foods without prior extraction of the lipid. The sample extract, in 10 mL n-hexane, is purified through a Florisil SPE cartridge which is washed with 10 mL n-hexane and the 2-alkylcyclobutanones eluted with 10 mL 2% diethyl ether in n-hexane before analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 2-Dodecylcyclobutanone and 2-tetradecylcyclobutanone were selectively extracted from irradiated chicken meat, liquid whole egg, ground beef, and mango as well as from beef burgers and baked products containing irradiated ground beef and liquid whole egg, respectively.

For example, chicken contained 0.08 mg/kg DEHP when uncooked, 13.1 mg/kg after frying and 16.9 mg/kg after packing. Disposable PVC gloves used in the preparation of foods were apparently the source of high DEHP concentrations. The gloves used during cooking or packaging were sprayed with 68% (w/w) ethanol to sterilize them. PVC gloves from the factory contained 22 or 41% by weight of DEHP. To confirm the link with the contamination problem, samples of boiled rice, croquette and boiled dry radish were handled in the laboratory with PVC gloves containing 30% (w/w) DEHP. DEHP migration levels of 0.05 mg/kg in rice or 0.33 mg/kg in croquette, and 11.1 mg/kg in radish were found. The alcohol sprayed onto the gloves increased the migration of DEHP to 2.03 mg/kg in rice, 2.45 mg, kg in croquette, and 18.4 mg/kg in radish.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D004051', 'D005506', 'D005511', 'D008401', 'D017575', 'D006801', 'D010968', 'D011143']","['Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Handling', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gloves, Protective', 'Humans', 'Plasticizers', 'Polyvinyl Chloride']",Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate contamination of retail packed lunches caused by PVC gloves used in the preparation of foods.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', None, None, 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11407756,2001

However, the role of dietary intake of BaP and cancer in humans is not clear. We created a BaP database of selected food products that could be linked to Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs) to estimate BaP intake. BaP levels were measured for each food line-item (composite samples) which consisted of a variety of foods in a FFQ. Composite sample parts were derived from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) which represents the most common food items consumed by the general population. Meat samples were cooked by different techniques in controlled conditions, and by various restaurants and fast-food chains. Non-meat products were purchased from the major national supermarket chains. The quantities of BaP were measured using a thin-layer chromatography (TLC)/spectrofluorometer technique and were highly correlated with both BaP (r=0.99) [corrected] and sum of carcinogenic PAH (r=0.98) measured by HPLC technique. We linked our database to the results from a FFQ and estimated the daily BaP intake of various food items in 228 subjects in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The highest levels of BaP (up to about 4 ng BaP/g of cooked meat) were found in grilled/barbecued very well done steaks and hamburgers and in grilled/barbecued well done chicken with skin. BaP concentrations were lower in meats that were grilled/barbecued to medium done and in all broiled or pan-fried meat samples regardless of doneness level. The BaP levels in non-meat items were generally low. However, certain cereals and greens (e.g. kale, collard greens) had levels up to 0.5 ng/g. In our population, the bread/cereal/grain, and grilled/barbecued meat, respectively, contributed 29 and 21 percent to the mean daily intake of BaP.

The following chemicals, which were present in some of the milk samples, were quantified by gas chromatography: residues of lindane (i.e., alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane [BHC], beta-BHC, gamma-BHC), delta-BHC, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p-DDE), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDD, and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT). With the assistance of a qualified dietitian, the mothers also completed a 7-d food-frequency questionnaire and provided additional personal information (e.g., educational level, profession, previous or present residence, use of pesticides, treatment of dermal scabies). Concentrations of gamma-BHC (i.e., lindane) were present in 57.1% of the samples (mean concentration = 0.58 microg/l [whole milk], range = nondetectable to 10.86 microg/l).

Growth rates and carcase characteristics were measured in male broiler chickens fed on a control diet deficient in methionine (c. 2.8 g/kg methionine) or a series of diets containing graded levels of betaine or DL-methionine or both additives. 2. We aimed to answer 2 main questions. First, can betaine replace part of the methionine in a broiler ration? Secondly is there a synergism between methionine and betaine? 3. Birds given the control diet or that supplemented only with betaine ate less, grew more slowly, had higher food convension ratio (FCR) and varied more in mass at 42 d than birds fed diets with DL-methionine. Adding 1.2 g/kg DL-methionine to the control ration produced the heaviest birds at 42 d (2500 g) with the 2nd heaviest breast muscle (366 g). 4. After correcting for treatment differences in body mass (analysis of convariance), birds fed on the control diet and the diet supplemented with betaine only, had relatively lighter breast muscles but relatively heavier abdominal fat pads than those of birds given diets supplemented with DL-methionine. However, adding betaine to diets containing added methionine further improved the relative breast muscle yield. 5. After correcting for differences in body mass between treatments, birds fed on diets containing most methionine had lighter viscera than birds fed diets deficient in methionine. This demonstrated gut plasticity, suggesting that the viscera enlarged to sequester methionine from low-methionine diets. 6.

10885619,"F2-isoprostanes (F2-IPs) are formed by the free radical-catalysed oxidation of arachidonic acid. The measurement of F2-IPs, especially 8-epi-PGF2alpha, is recognised as a reliable marker of lipid peroxidation and is currently used as a sensitive index of oxidative stress in vivo. The majority of 8-epi-PGF2alpha present in the circulation occurs in association with lipoproteins which are synthesised in the liver. Since lipoproteins are derived from dietary fatty acids and triglycerides, it is possible that 8-epi-PGF2alpha generated in polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich food (during initial processing/packaging or during meal preparation) may become incorporated within these lipoproteins during synthesis. In view of the growing use of 8-epi-PGF2alpha as a marker of lipid peroxidation in vivo in nutritional or clinical studies, it is therefore important to investigate the possibility that the circulating levels measured could be confounded by the presence of 8-epi-PGF2alpha in food. In this study we evaluated the levels of 8-epi-PGF2alpha present in several popular fast-foods, using a combination of solid phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fast-foods were selected to represent meals prepared from vegetable-, chicken-, fish- and meat-derived ingredients. Total (free + esterified) 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels ranged from 0.09 to 0.73 pmol/g (122-644 pmol/mmol arachidonic acid), with the highest levels present in beef-derived meals. Further investigation of hamburgers and cheeseburgers revealed 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels of 1.83 +/- 0.24 and 0.84 +/- 0.03nmol/mmol arachidonic acid, respectively. Lower concentrations of vitamin E were found in the hamburgers. The postprandial contribution to plasma 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels following ingestion of 100 g portions of these fast-foods would therefore be expected to be no greater than the low picomole range, and would be unlikely to influence the normal endogenous levels of 8-epi-PGF2alpha and those produced during oxidative stress.",Free radical research,"['D000818', 'D002784', 'D004032', 'D004041', 'D015237', 'D004435', 'D005227', 'D008401', 'D015227', 'D008054', 'D014810']","['Animals', 'Cholesterol', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dinoprost', 'Eating', 'Fatty Acids', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lipid Peroxides', 'Vitamin E']",Measurement of plasma F2-isoprostanes as an index of lipid peroxidation does not appear to be confounded by diet.,"[None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000008', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000097']","[None, 'blood', None, 'administration & dosage', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'blood', 'methods', None, 'blood', 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10885619,2000

The first experiment was designed to test 2 sources of dietary fat and 3 levels of dietary energy using a factorial (2x3) experimental design. The foods were formulated to maintain a constant ratio of energy to protein (and other nutrients). There were no significant differences in weight gain, intake, final body weight or food to gain ratio between broilers fed on diets differing solely in the degree of fat saturation. Broilers fed on diets containing animal fat showed higher whole-body fat retention (P=0.02) and lower protein accretion (P=0.03) than those fed on diets containing vegetable oils. 3. In the second experiment, only 1 concentration of fat (tallow, lard or sunflower oil) was incorporated into the experimental diets, providing different energy to protein ratios. The carcase protein content was not affected by dietary fat source, while total fat accretion (P=0.01) and energy retention (P=0.14) were highest in broilers fed on a diet containing tallow. 4.

10224019,"Twelve human and chicken isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis belonging to phage types 4, 8, 13a, and 23 were characterized for variability in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) composition. Isolates were differentiated into two groups, i.e., those that lacked immunoreactive O-chain, termed rough isolates, and those that had immunoreactive O-chain, termed smooth isolates. Isolates within these groups could be further differentiated by LPS compositional differences as detected by gel electrophoresis and gas liquid chromatography of samples extracted with water, which yielded significantly more LPS in comparison to phenol-chloroform extraction. The rough isolates were of two types, the O-antigen synthesis mutants and the O-antigen polymerization (wzy) mutants. Smooth isolates were also of two types, one producing low-molecular-weight (LMW) LPS and the other producing high-molecular-weight (HMW) LPS. To determine the genetic basis for the O-chain variability of the smooth isolates, we analyzed the effects of a null mutation in the O-chain length determinant gene, wzz (cld) of serovar Typhimurium. This mutation results in a loss of HMW LPS; however, the LMW LPS of this mutant was longer and more glucosylated than that from clinical isolates of serovar Enteritidis. Cluster analysis of these data and of those from two previously characterized isogenic strains of serovar Enteritidis that had different virulence attributes indicated that glucosylation of HMW LPS (via oafR function) is variable and results in two types of HMW structures, one that is highly glucosylated and one that is minimally glucosylated.

Ten congeners were measurable in butter (0.27-2.5 pg/g) and nine congeners were measurable in lamb fat (0.09-2.6 pg/g) with good precision. LOQs for high-fat foods were estimated by triplicate analysis of peanut oil fortified at two levels. Accurate and reproducible results were achieved at 0.5 pg/g for most PCDD/Fs (1.0 pg/g for heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and heptachlorodibenzofuran and 2.0 pg/g for octachlorodibenzofuran) and at 0.2 pg/g for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).

The primary structure of this 37-amino acid peptide was established as follows: ACNTA TCVTH RLADF LSRSG GIGNS NFVPT NVGSK AF-NH2. The peptide shows close structural similarities to other nonmammalian (3-4 amino acid substitutions) and mammalian (5-8 amino acid substitutions) CGRPs, and it contains the two residues Asp14 and Phe15 that seem to be characteristic for CGRP in nonmammalian vertebrates. Cod CGRP (10(-9)-10(-7) M) inhibited the motility of spontaneously active ring preparations from the cod intestine and was significantly (P < 0.05) more potent than rat alpha-CGRP. Neither prostaglandins nor nitric oxide is involved in the inhibitory response produced by cod CGRP, and the lack of effect of tetrodotoxin suggests an action of CGRP on receptors on the intestinal smooth muscle cells. The competitive CGRP antagonist human alpha-CGRP-(8-37) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the response to cod CGRP. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated CGRP-immunoreactive neurons intrinsic to the intestine, and a dense innervation with immunoreactive nerve fibers was observed in the myenteric plexus and the circular muscle layer.

The effect of supplementary levels of natural antioxidants, as alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, on the meat cholesterol oxidative stability was also studied. Lard, sunflower and olive oil were used as dietary fat. Raw and cooked meats were analyzed for oxysterols, and cholesterol was also quantified. Oxysterol analyses were carried out by combining the use of solid-phase extraction, thin-layer chromatography, capillary gas chromatography, and capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Oxysterols were detected within the 0.1-0.5 microg/g range in raw meat. Cooking increased the oxysterol content of the meat, and levels as high as 5 microg/g muscle tissue were observed. B-Ring oxysterols were mainly produced: the alpha- and the beta-epoxycholesterols, the 7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxycholesterols, and the 7-ketocholesterol.

Although recognized as mutagenic, the etiological role of HCA in human cancer is unclear, due to the lack of information on the effect of typical food cooking methods on HCA concentrations and on variation in HCA exposure in populations. We estimated overall daily dietary HCA intake and variation in intake between individuals, using recent data on HCA concentrations in various meats prepared by cooking methods, temperatures, and times common in United States in the 1990s. Random samples of 250 participants from each of three large prospective cohorts were mailed a questionnaire to assess frequency of consumption, cooking method, and typical outside appearance of pan-fried, broiled, and grilled or barbecued chicken, fish, hamburger, and steak; fried, microwaved, and broiled bacon; fried sausage; roast beef; and homemade gravy. The 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), and 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5,f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) concentrations, measured in composite samples by solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography, were assigned to each food, cooking method, and doneness level. The dietary reports showed approximately 30-fold relative variation in 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline intake, 20-fold for 2-amino- -methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, and over 110-fold for 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5,f]quinoxaline, when the 10th and 90th percentiles of HCA intake were compared (90th/10th percentile value). These reported variations in HCA exposure among participants in these three large cohorts indicates that estimation of HCA intake and determination of association with disease risk are feasible, if additional information on meat cooking methods is obtained.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology","['D000328', 'D000588', 'D003296', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D008460', 'D008875', 'D009369', 'D011237', 'D011446', 'D012307', 'D011795', 'D014481']","['Adult', 'Amines', 'Cooking', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meat', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",Predictors of dietary heterocyclic amine intake in three prospective cohorts.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000009', None, 'Q000178', None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'adverse effects', None, 'diet therapy', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9641497,1998

HAAs are a group of recently recognized mutagenic/carcinogenic contaminants in foods that are produced during the heat processing of meat. 16 samples of meat cuts (e.g. turkey breast, salami, chicken loaf, cooked ham, all beef meat, pepperoni, etc.), randomly purchased from supermarkets and specialty food stores in the Ottawa area, were analysed for the presence of eight HAAs. The isolation of HAAs was based on sequential liquid-liquid extraction procedures of the samples at both acidic and basic pH values. The mutagenic activity of these samples was determined using the Ames/Salmonella microsome assay with the strain TA98 plus rat liver S-9 metabolic activation. The mutagenicity of these samples ranged from undetectable to slightly active. The highest mutagenic activity, 141 induced revertants/g, was found in a smoked turkey breast sample. 11 samples were not mutagenic, including two that indicated a tendency for inhibition of the spontaneous revertants. The remaining four samples exhibited very low mutagenic activity. For chemical analysis, the extracts were purified with two solid phase extraction cartridges. Quantitative analysis was performed by using liquid chromatography for separation and mass spectrometry for detection. With the exception of trace amounts (0.4 ng/g) of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) in the sample with highest mutagenic activity, the chemical analysis did not detect the presence of any of the eight most frequently found HAAs in fried or broiled meat products.

The fate of fumonisins during commercial processing of maize was also assessed at each stage of the process. Fumonisins were not detected in samples of barley, wheat, soya, oats, rice, corn syrup or oil, corn-on-the-cob, corn-fed chicken or wheat flour tortilla. Despite detectable fumonisin contamination in samples of the original maize, fumonisins were not detected in samples of the food products obtained from commercial maize processing. Low levels were detected in samples of tacos and in some foods containing corn-based thickeners, such as instant semolina pudding and instant custard powder. Approximately 78% of corn snack samples contained fumonisins (11-220 micrograms/kg), while 24% of breakfast cereals contained total fumonisins at between 11 and 194 micrograms/kg. Although none of the ready-made popcorn samples contained detectable levels of fumonisins, 46% of popping corn samples and microwaveable popcorn contained fumonisins at 14-784 micrograms/kg.

In two addition assays, various individual and combined additions of eight AA were made to semipurified basal diets containing 16% protein solely from a MBM. The two MBM had previously been determined to vary greatly in protein quality. In the deletion assay, a semipurified basal diet containing 13.5% CP provided solely by MBM was supplemented with L-Thr, L-Val, DL-Met, L-Leu, L-Ile, L-Phe, L-Tyr, L-Lys-HCl, L-His, and L-Trp to fulfill the Illinois Ideal Protein or AA pattern on a digestible basis. Each AA was then deleted individually from the basal diet, and the effect of its deletion on growth performance was assessed. In both addition assays, supplementation of the MBM basal diet with Trp and Cys together yielded a large increase in growth performance, whereas supplementation with these AA individually had no effect. These results indicated that Trp and sulfur AA (with a primary need for Cys) were equally first limiting in the MBM. The order of limitation for the other AA was unclear. The results of the deletion assay showed that deletion of Trp, Thr, Phe + Tyr, Ile, Met, Lys, Val, or His significantly depressed growth performance. The results of the combined addition and deletion experiments indicated that the order of AA limitation in MBM was 1) Trp and sulfur AA, 2) Thr, 3) Ile and Phe + Tyr, 4) Met, 5) Lys, and 6) Val and His.

9000275,"Two experiments were conducted to investigate the usefulness of a natural golden marine algae (MA) as a poultry ration supplement for the production of shell eggs rich in n-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA). This MA is unique due to a high concentration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n-3) and the absence of other n-3 FA normally present in marine oils such as menhaden oil (MO). In the first experiment, 60 24-wk-old Single Comb White Leghorn (SCWL) hens were divided among four dietary treatments, including a typical corn-soybean control (CON); 1.5% MO, supplying 233 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 155 mg DHA per d; 2.4% MA, supplying 200 mg DHA/d; and 4.8% MA, supplying 400 mg DHA/d. A second experiment using 96 56-wk-old SCWL was conducted using the same diets. In both experiments, eggs were collected weekly for 4 wk for determination of egg production parameters and yolk FA content. Each week, yolk samples were extracted, methyl estered, and quantified using gas chromatography. Transient depression in egg and yolk weights were noted early in Experiment 1 in response to dietary 4.8% MA. Although egg and yolk weights were not affected in Experiment 2, egg production was significantly reduced in the 4.8% MA treatment. Egg production was unaffected due to diet or week in Experiment 1. In both experiments, yolk polyunsaturated profiles were significantly influenced by diet. Dietary n-3 FA supplementation significantly increased yolk total N-3 FA with concomitant reductions in yolk n-6 FA. Although hens fed MO were supplied predominantly EPA, the principal yolk FA deposited was DHA. Marine algae also promoted efficient yolk DHA deposition with the highest yolk DHA concentrations attained in eggs from hens fed 4.8% MA.

Approximately 66% of the eggs contained lasalocid residues at concentrations in excess of 0.3 ng/g. There was no apparent difference in the incidence of lasalocid residues between free range and battery eggs. Carry-over of lasalocid from medicated to unmedicated batches of both premix and feed, during milling processes, was identified as a possible cause of contamination. Subsequently, egg-laying birds were fed meal containing a range of lasalocid concentrations, similar to those found as a result of unintentional contamination at a feed mill (0.1-5.0 mg/kg). The concentrations of lasalocid, measured in their eggs, were similar to that found in the survey.

The amounts of the heterocyclic amines 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5,-b]pyridine were determined only in samples grilled at 220 degrees C, using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique with negative-ion chemical ionization. Sensory quality was determined using the extended ranking test method and the mutagenic activity using the Ames Salmonella assay. At 220 degrees C one of the marinades decreased the mutagenic activity in the chicken samples compared with the unseasoned control or samples treated with the other marinades. Great variations, without any clear correlation with mutagenicity, were observed in the amounts of heterocyclic amines between chicken samples treated with the same or different marinades. At the grilling temperatures of 170 degrees C and 110 degrees C the mutagenic activities of the chicken samples were lower or they were non-mutagenic. There was no correlation between mutagenic activity and sensory quality of the products. The samples with high mutagenic activity were ranked to be as good as the samples with lower or no mutagenicity. The results show that it is possible to prepare grilled products with reduced mutagenicity without compromising their sensory quality.

Dihydro-vitamin K1 is absorbed, with measurable levels in human plasma following dietary intake. To determine the primary food sources of dihydro-vitamin K1 in the American diet, 261 foods from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Total Diet Study (TDS) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Of these foods, 36 contained dihydro-vitamin K1. Fast-food items that were otherwise poor sources of vitamin K1, such as french fries and fried chicken, contained appreciable amounts of dihydro-vitamin K1 (36 and 18 micrograms/100 g, respectively). These nutrient values were then applied to the FDA TDS consumption model to determine average dietary intake of dihydro-vitamin K1 in 14 age-gender groups. With the exception of infants, all age-gender groups had estimated mean daily dihydro-vitamin K1 intakes of 12-24 micrograms, compared to mean daily vitamin K1 intakes of 24-86 micrograms. The vitamin K1 and dihydro-vitamin K1 intakes were summed, and the dietary contribution of dihydro-vitamin K1 was expressed as a percentage of total vitamin K intake. Children reported the highest intakes of dihydro-vitamin K1 (30% of total vitamin K intake), followed by a progressive decrease in percentage contribution with age.

8683344,"The relationship between the rate of protein synthesis and the level of messenger RNA (mRNA) in the breast muscle (pectoralis major) was studied to examine the mechanisms regulating muscle protein synthesis in chicks under various nutritional conditions. The fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of protein was measured by a large-dose injection of L-[4-3H]phenylalanine. Poly(U)-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography was used to extract Poly(A)+ RNA as mRNA. The first study examined the effect of dietary protein levels (0-60%) on protein synthesis rate and the contents of mRNA and total RNA. The fractional synthesis rate increased with increasing dietary protein levels from 0 to 20%. When chicks were fed high protein diets (40 and 60% of dietary protein), both the FSR and absolute synthesis rate (ASR) of protein were reduced compared with the 20% protein group. Multiple regression analysis indicated that for graded dietary protein levels below the dietary protein requirement, the response of muscle protein synthesis is largely regulated by variation in the ASR per unit RNA (the efficiency of RNA in synthesizing protein). At dietary protein levels above 20%, synthesis rates are also related to changes in the RNA:mRNA ratio (ribosome number relative to mRNA), the mRNA:DNA ratio (mRNA availability) and the DNA:protein ratio (DNA concentration). When chicks were food deprived for 2 d, FSR was reduced to about half that of well-fed controls. Upon refeeding of these chicks with the control diet, the FSR returned to the normal level within 0.5 h. When food-deprived chicks were refed with protein, carbohydrate or fat alone, the FSR returned to the control level within 0.5 h after consumption of each nutrient. The increase in muscle protein synthesis of unfed chicks following refeeding of various nutrients was explained by an increased ASR per unit RNA.

8676050,"We have examined the influence of nutrition on plasma IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) levels and on hepatic IGF-I gene expression in young meat-type chickens. Plasma IGF concentrations were measured by using RIA with recombinant chicken IGFs as standards. In chickens fed the control diet containing 200 g/kg dietary protein ad libitum for 7 days, plasma IGF-I concentrations increased significantly from those found in the initial control group. Food restriction for either 4 or 7 days decreased plasma IGF-I by 30% from the initial control. When chickens were refed ad libitum for 3 days after 4 days of restricted feeding, plasma IGF-I levels recovered to those of the control birds fed ad libitum. In chickens eating a low protein diet (100 g/kg protein), the plasma IGF-I tended to be lowered but the decrease was not significant. Although the intensity of IGF-I and beta-actin mRNA bands protected in the RNase protection assay was changed by nutrition, no statistical effect of nutrition on the ratio of IGF-I to beta-actin was observed. The nutritional treatments had no effect on plasma IGF-II concentrations. Western ligand blot and chromatographic analyses were used to investigate the influence of nutrition on IGFBP profiles. Both IGF-I and IGF-II ligands in the Western ligand blot revealed the most intense binding at 30 kDa for plasma obtained from chickens with restricted food intake. The 30 kDa band also appeared at a lower intensity in the group fed a low protein diet but not in any other groups. These observations were confirmed by neutral gel chromatography.

Dietary 20:4(n-6) may also contribute to tissue 20:4(n-6) levels in humans, but the extent of this contribution is unclear. We believe that literature estimates of 20:4(n-6) intake of 200-1000 mg/d are too high, possibly because of incorrect values in food composition tables where high amounts of 20:4(n-6) are recorded in margarines, some vegetable products and animal fat. We assessed the 20:4(n-6) content of common Australian foods and found that the 20:4(n-6) levels (on a 100-g edible basis), were 891 mg and 390 mg, respectively, for duck and chicken egg yolks, 294 mg for liver, 153 mg for kidney, 75 mg for skinless turkey, 56 mg for lean pork, 49 mg for lean lamb, 31 mg for chicken breast, 56 mg for chicken legs and 35 mg for lean beef. Eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5(n-3)] levels were < 10 mg/100 g in chicken meat, turkey meat, emu meat and chicken eggs, whereas the values for 20:5(n-3) for beef, lamb, liver, kidney and duck egg yolk ranged from 11 to 138 mg/100 g food. Applying our current 20:4(n-6) measurements to previously determined food intakes of Australian adults determined in an Australiawide survey in 1983, we estimated the mean 20:4(n-6) intake for Australian adult males to be 130 mg/d and females 96 mg/d.

8006309,"When attempting to generate mouse monoclonal antibodies to hen's egg ovalbumin, injection of commercially purified ovalbumin resulted in monoclonal antibodies, which when assayed against commercially purified ovalbumin (Gal d I) or ovomucoid (Gal d III), appeared to be specific to both. With the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-repurified ovalbumin and ovomucoid in assay procedures, monoclonal antibodies generated by commercially purified ovalbumin were found to be specific for ovomucoid only. To clarify this phenomenon, mice were serially injected with commercially purified ovalbumin or HPLC-repurified ovalbumin. It was found that most of the antibody response to commercially purified ovalbumin was directed against the minor (< 1%) ovomucoid contaminant and that HPLC-repurified ovalbumin failed to produce antibodies to ovomucoid. Commercially purified ovomucoid resulted in only minimal amounts of antibodies to ovalbumin. Thus when commercially purified ovalbumin is used both for immunization and immunoassay, most of the antibodies produced are actually against the small amount of ovomucoid contaminant, and not ovalbumin. To determine whether ovomucoid is the major antigenic and allergenic egg white protein in human beings, one group of 18 children with egg allergy were skin prick tested with half-log dilutions of egg white extract and diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE)-repurified ovomucoid, ovalbumin, and lysozyme. Ovomucoid mean wheal diameters were significantly greater than wheal diameters in response to ovalbumin, lysozyme, and egg white extract at the three most concentrated of five dilutions tested: 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/ml (p < 0.01). Serum ovomucoid-specific IgE and IgG antibody concentrations to DEAE-repurified ovomucoid were significantly greater than that to DEAE-repurified ovalbumin (p < 0.05). In a second study, 10 patients with egg allergy and persistent egg hypersensitivity were compared with 11 patients with egg allergy in whom clinical tolerance to egg developed. IgE antibodies to repurified ovomucoid were significantly greater in patients with persistent egg hypersensitivity compared with patients in whom clinical tolerance developed at the time of both initial and follow-up food challenges. In contrast, there were no significant differences in IgE antibody concentrations to repurified ovalbumin in either group at any time.

Assays of incurred samples were performed after dosing a cow and several chickens with alachlor. Alachlor was detected in milk and eggs, but not in livers from hens dosed up to 12 mg/kg body weight. The ELISA detection limits were 0.3 ng/mL in milk, 2 ng/g in eggs, and 3 ng/g in liver. The major drawback with the kits was the low cross-reactivity of the antibodies for some of the alachlor metabolites.","Journal of environmental science and health. Part.

8029489,"Ciguatera toxins are odorless, tasteless, and generally undetectable by any simple chemical test; therefore, bioassays have traditionally been used to monitor suspect fish. Many native tests for toxicity in fish have been examined, including the discoloration of silver coins or copper wire or the repulsion of flies and ants, but all of these were rejected as invalid. Oral feeding of fish to cats or mongoose is a simple and relatively sensitive assay, but cats often regurgitate part of the meal. Feeding tests described above have been used in screening fish for toxicity, but they are cumbersome and nonquantitative. A mouse bioassay was developed; unfortunately, this procedure requires purification fish extracts, since mice are not very sensitive to ciguatoxin. An alternative to the use of mice is the mosquito bioassay, which was recently used to obtain a dose-response relationship between ingested ciguatoxin and clinical symptoms in man. This assay correlates reasonably well with cat and mouse bioassay. Many other bioassays have been developed using chicken, brine shrimp, and the guinea pig atrium. All traditional bioassays have one common disadvantage, the lack of specificity for individual toxins. Recent studies have also focused on the development of chemical methods, i.e., TLC and HPLC, for the detection and quantification of ciguatera-related toxins (okadaic acid and ciguatoxin and its analogs). Alternative assays based on immunochemical technology have been developed and show the greatest promise for use in seafood safety monitoring programs. For earlier methods (RIA and ELISA formats), liver extracts from ciguatoxic eels were used to prepare ciguatoxin antisera. The assay has been further adapted to a solid-phase immunobead assay (S-PIA), which has a very high potential for use as a marketplace screening tool to separate ciguateric fish. This assay can also be used to monitor reefs for ciguatera potential. Historically, attempts to validate methods used to measure ciguatera toxicity have been plagued with a lack of specificity and reference standards. These restrictions have been resolved, and a study is under way to evaluate the precision and accuracy of a low-cost, simplified field and laboratory S-PIA kit (Ciguatect, Hawaii Chemtect International, Pasadena, California, 91109), through an international interlaboratory trial using the AOAC/IUPAC validation mechanism.",Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology,"['D000818', 'D001681', 'D002273', 'D002851', 'D002922', 'D004988', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D019319', 'D012015', 'D012449']","['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Carcinogens', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ciguatoxins', 'Ethers, Cyclic', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Reference Standards', 'Safety']",Evolution of methods for assessing ciguatera toxins in fish.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8029489,1994

While in unirradiated samples no traces of special hydrocarbons (according to the fatty acid composition of egg) and no traces of the irradiation-specific compound 2-Dodecyl-cyclobutanone were found, irradiated control samples as well as products of two Belgian suppliers contained these substances. Additionally, regarding the rather high time consumption of gas chromatography, electron spin resonance (ESR)-measurements were carried out on the packaging material of egg products. Irradiated packaging material (cellulose) could be easily detected by the appearance of a signal pair in the ESR spectrum (cellulose radical). ESR measurements are very fast and easy to perform so that this method can be used for screening.

8354275,"A sialic-acid-binding lectin with specificity for N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) was purified from the hemolymph of the marine crab Scylla serrata by affinity chromatography using thyroglobulin-coupled agarose. The binding specificity of Scylla lectin distinguishes it from other known sialic-acid-specific lectins found in Limulus polyphemus and Limax flavus, which show a broader range of specificity for sialic acids. The molecular mass of the purified lectin is about 55 kDa. Under reducing conditions (SDS/PAGE), it resolved into two subunits of 30 kDa and 25 kDa. NeuGc inhibited hemagglutination activity of the purified lectin at a concentration as low as 0.6 mM, whereas N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) even at a concentration of 100 mM, failed to inhibit hemagglutination. This finding was supported by potent inhibition of hemagglutination by bovine and porcine thyroglobulins, which contain a NeuGc alpha 2-6Gal as terminal component of oligosaccharide residues. Neither glycoproteins (glycophorin NN; porcine submaxillary mucin), which contain NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal/GalNAc and NeuAc alpha 2-6GalNAc, nor human acid glycoprotein, which contains NeuAc alpha 2-3/alpha 2-6 Gal, or colominic acid, a sialopolymer with NeuAc alpha 2-8NeuAc, inhibited the lectin activity. The specificity of the lectin for NeuGc appears to account for the fact that it agglutinates rabbit and mice erythrocytes, but not human A, O, AB, rat or chicken erythrocytes, which contain NeuAc. The inability of the lectin to agglutinate erythrocytes (horse) that prominently express NeuGc could be due to O-acetylation of NeuGc. In support of this, bovine submaxillary mucin, which contains O-acetylated NeuGc inhibited the hemagglutination of the lectin better after removal of O-acetyl groups by base treatment. The unique specificity of Scylla lectin is of diagnostic potential for human cancer tissues expressing NeuGc, since NeuGc is not found in normal human tissues.",European journal of biochemistry,"['D000818', 'D001665', 'D003386', 'D002240', 'D002846', 'D004591', 'D004912', 'D006386', 'D006458', 'D006801', 'D037102', 'D008969', 'D009438', 'D012794']","['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Brachyura', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythrocytes', 'Hemagglutination Tests', 'Hemolymph', 'Humans', 'Lectins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuraminic Acids', 'Sialic Acids']",Purification and characterization of N-glycolyneuraminic-acid-specific lectin from Scylla serrata.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000037', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8354275,1993

Additionally, on farms with suspected mycotoxin problems, necropsies of affected chickens were performed for gross and microscopic examinations. A total of 315 samples were analysed for AFB1 using a semi-quantitative enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA kits) and thin-layer chromatography. In feedmills, 4% of samples contained AFB1; 17% among sunflower meal samples (20-80 ppb) and 4% among corn (110 ppb) and mixed feed samples (20-110 ppb). On poultry farms, 17% of samples were found contaminated with AFB1; 20% were positive among pellets and 16% among crumbles and 15% mash feeds. The level of contamination ranged from 20 ppb to 200 ppb, except for 4 samples that contained high levels of AFB1 (2000-5625 ppb). These highly-contaminated samples were associated with clinical aflatoxicosis in broiler chickens. The most frequent incidence of AFB1 contamination and the highest AFB1 contamination occurred in feeding troughs (23%).

We have investigated the core histone octamer of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and have found it to be much more stable than its vertebrate animal counterpart. When vertebrate animal histone octamers are subjected to gel filtration in 2 M NaCl, a trailing peak of H2A-H2B dimer can be clearly resolved from the main octamer peak. When the plant octamer is subjected to the identical procedure, there is no trailing peak of H2A-H2B dimer, but rather a single peak containing the octamer. A sampling across the octamer peak from leading to trailing edge shows no change in the ratio of H2A-H2B to (H3-H4)2. Surprisingly, the plant octamer shows the same stability at 0.6 M NaCl, a salt concentration in which the vertebrate animal octamer dissociates into dimers and tetramers. Equilibrium sedimentation data indicate that the assembly potential of the wheat histones in 2 M NaCl is very high at all protein concentrations above 0.1 mg mL-1. In order to disrupt the forces stabilizing the plant histone octamer at high histone concentrations, the concentration of NaCl must be lowered to approximately 0.3 M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Biochemistry,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D002850', 'D004355', 'D006657', 'D046911', 'D008970', 'D009707', 'D010944', 'D012965', 'D014908']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Drug Stability', 'Histones', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleosomes', 'Plants', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Triticum']",Enhanced stability of histone octamers from plant nucleosomes: role of H2A and H2B histones.,"[None, 'Q000097', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000648', 'Q000494', None]","[None, 'blood', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'ultrastructure', 'pharmacology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1420197,1992

2017211,"Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are common contaminants of processed food, usually at trace levels. These hydrocarbons are products of combustion and pyrolysis, and are present in petroleum and coal, and in products derived from them. Most polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are not carcinogenic, but some of them are, and a few are potent inducers of skin and lung tumors in mice. Their carcinogenic properties have not been fully explored, but they seem to be less potent by ingestion or inhalation, and they are known as a group to produce cancer in humans. The most effective carcinogens among them are those with 5 or 6 fused rings, and these tend to be less prevalent in mixtures than the 3- and 4-ring hydrocarbons, most of which are not carcinogenic. Sophisticated analytical methods, using solvent extraction and chromatography have been developed to detect and measure polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons at levels of 1 in 10(9) (1 part per billion) or less, and these have been applied to the measurement of individual compounds in foods, as well as in products of combustion and pyrolysis. Wood smoke and smoked foods contain the carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene at levels of 1 ppb, and other hydrocarbons; liquid smoke has lower levels. Crude vegetable oils have higher concentrations, but purified 'deodorized' oils have benzo[a]pyrene levels near 1 ppb. Sausages cooked over burning logs had as much as 200 ppb benzo[a]pyrene. Charcoal-broiled steaks and ground meat had benzo[a]pyrene concentrations up to 50 micrograms/kg, while less fatty pork and chicken had lower concentrations (up to 10 micrograms/kg). It was probable that the rendered fat dripped on to the hot charcoal and pyrolyzed to form quantities of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, which rose with the smoke to deposit on the meat. Therefore, oven cooking or cooking with a heat source above the meat, or segregation of the meat from the smoke resulted in food containing negligible amounts of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Modifications of cookings practices accordingly would greatly reduce exposure to this group of carcinogens.",Mutation research,"['D000818', 'D015197', 'D002417', 'D003296', 'D005506', 'D006358', 'D008460', 'D011083', 'D013552']","['Animals', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Cattle', 'Cooking', 'Food Contamination', 'Hot Temperature', 'Meat', 'Polycyclic Compounds', 'Swine']",The formation and occurrence of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons associated with food.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2017211,1991

2356179,"The digestibility of nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) were measured in cockerels. Muscovy ducks, and rats by using four diets where the only sources of NSP were wheat bran (Diet B), whole wheat grain (Diet W), soybean meal (Diet S), or white lupin meal (Diet L). The four diets contained similar amounts of crude protein (24.4%), lipids (5.2%), and NSP (6.9%). The proportions of water-soluble NSP in total NSP were 11.1% (Diet B), 19.7% (Diet W), 8% (Diet S), and 11.5% (Diet L). The NSP contents of feed and excreta were determined by measuring their individual sugars, using gas-liquid chromatography of alditol acetate derivatives. The digestibility values of NSP ranged from 21.9% (Diet W) to 13% (Diet L) for cockerels, from 18.7% (Diet W) to 7.9% (Diet L) for ducks, and from 85.7% (Diet L) to 44.1% (Diet B) for rats. These results suggest that cockerels and ducks were only able to digest the water-soluble fraction of the nonstarch polysaccharides. The pectic polymers, which were major components in water-insoluble NSP of Diets S and L, were digested to a high extent by the rats. The digestible-energy (DE) values, calculated for the birds from the apparent metabolizable-energy values corrected for nitrogen retention (AMEn), were very similar when cockerels and ducks were compared; the differences between bird species did not exceed .23 MJ per kg of dry matter. In all cases, the DE values were higher for rats than for birds.

Because the erythrocyte membranes of formula-fed infants are depleted in long-chain PUFA, we sought food sources of these 20- and 22-carbon polyunsaturates suitable for use as dietary supplements. A variety of commercially available infant foods containing meats and egg products in addition to some whole foods (meat, eggs) were analyzed by gas chromatography. Commercially available infant foods contained only low levels of long-chain PUFA. The richest source of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA was found to be lamb brains but lamb and chicken livers as well as egg yolks also contained high levels. However, the lipid content of most whole foods including brains, eggs, and liver is so low that prohibitively large amounts of food would be required to be fed to infants.

The growth inhibition of 20 ppm Se was partially alleviated by feeding it in combination with 2000 ppm Pb; however, mortality was increased significantly by the combination. In contrast 40 ppm Se resulted in almost complete cessation of growth and 85% mortality, whereas the combination with 2000 ppm Pb partially overcame the growth inhibition and eliminated the excess mortality. When Pb or Se were fed alone, hepatic levels of the fed element were elevated. There were further significant elevations of hepatic levels of both elements when fed in combination at identical dietary concentrations as the single element additions.

3125998,"The form(s) in which malondialdehyde (MDA), a mutagenic product of the oxidative decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), occurs in foods was investigated. Several foods of animal origin (ground beef, smoked fish, chicken, sausages) were digested in vitro using pepsin and porcine intestinal fluid and the occurrence of MDA derivatives in the digesta was investigated by thin-layer, column and high-performance liquid chromatography. The predominant form of MDA was shown to be identical to synthetic N-epsilon-propenal lysine. This compound is apparently formed by a reaction between free MDA generated as a product of the oxidative rancidity of PUFA in foods and the free epsilon-amino groups of proteins, from which it is released in the course of digestion. It has been shown to be excreted in rat and human urine partially in the unchanged form and partially as the N-alpha-acetyl derivative.

3339003,"A lectin that can specifically bind to O-acetylsialic acids, found in glycoproteins and gangliosides, was purified to homogeneity from a crab Cancer antennarius (crab lectin) (Ravindranath, M. H., Higa, H. H., Cooper, E. L., and Paulson, J. C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8850-8856; Correction (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1983; Ravindranath, M. H., and Paulson, J. C. (1987) Methods Enzymol. 138, 520-527). We tested lectin binding to human melanoma cell lines to identify O-acetylsialylated gangliosides on the melanoma cell surface. The highest degree of binding of the crab lectin was demonstrated on a melanoma cell line, UCLASO-M25. To confirm that the binding was due to O-acetylsialic acid in the alkali-labile gangliosides, the gangliosides were isolated and purified from M25 cells and individually coated onto sheep asialoerythrocytes, which served as targets in an agglutination assay using the lectin. The crab lectin agglutinated the asialo-sheep erythrocytes coated with alkali-labile gangliosides, but the lectin failed to agglutinate the asialoerythrocytes coated with GM3, GD3, and base-treated gangliosides. Subsequently, the purified alkali-labile M25 ganglioside was base-treated and applied to TLC, and we found that it was converted to a slower migrating species identical to the disialolactosylceramide (GD3). These results indicate that O-acetyl GD3 expressed on the melanoma cell surface is recognized by the lectin. Because O-acetyl GD3 is not expressed on human normal tissues, we examined the capability of O-acetyl GD3 to induce immune responses in man. Sera from patients with melanoma were tested against M25 cells in an immuneadherence assay, and those positive to the M25 cell line were further tested for specificity to O-acetyl gangliosides. The presence of autoantibodies to O-acetyl-GD3 in melanoma sera was confirmed by blocking of the antigen sites on M25 cells by the lectin or preabsorption of the sera with erythrocytes bearing O-acetyl gangliosides. The data provide evidence that O-acetyl-GD3 may represent an important tumor marker for detection and treatment of human melanoma.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D000107', 'D000818', 'D001323', 'D003386', 'D002645', 'D002855', 'D004912', 'D005732', 'D006017', 'D006041', 'D006736', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D008545', 'D051379', 'D011817', 'D012756', 'D012794', 'D013045', 'D014407']","['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Autoantibodies', 'Brachyura', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Erythrocytes', 'Gangliosides', 'Glycolipids', 'Goats', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Mice', 'Rabbits', 'Sheep', 'Sialic Acids', 'Species Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",Human melanoma antigen O-acetylated ganglioside GD3 is recognized by Cancer antennarius lectin.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000276', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000276', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000276']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'immunology', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'immunology', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'immunology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3339003,1988

3553187,"The existence in invertebrates, unicellular eukaryotes, and prokaryotes of materials that resemble several vertebrate peptide hormones led to the suggestion that these peptide messengers may have arisen earlier in evolution than had previously been thought. Consistent with this hypothesis, we describe here material in two plants, spinach and Lemma gibba G3, that is very similar to mammalian insulin, yet distinctive. In each of the early purification steps, which consisted of acidic methanol chloroform extraction and sequential chromatography on C-18 hydrophobic resin, Sephadex G-50, CM-Sepharose, and a short C-3 high performance liquid chromatography column, the immunoactive material from plants resembled the common vertebrate insulins. The protein nature of the material was suggested by its destruction by Pronase but not by the inactivated enzyme. In addition, on TSK chromatography it eluted in a position similar to that of insulin, i.e. equivalent to a protein of 6000 daltons. Using an isocratic high performance liquid chromatography system, the plant immunoactivity eluted earlier, and thus was more hydrophilic, than most of the common mammalian insulins, including pork insulin. The interaction of the plant material with anti-insulin antibodies in a radioimmunoassay was confirmed by using an affinity column of anti-insulin antibodies which adsorbed the plant immunoactivity at neutral pH, and released the material with acid elution. Using a quantitative double radioimmunoassay, the plant insulin-like material was distinguished immunologically from chicken insulin. Although the plant insulin-like material is clearly distinct from pork insulin chromatographically, and from chicken insulin immunologically, it resembles vertebrate insulins in its overall configuration. The plant insulin-like material bound to insulin receptors on IM-9 lymphocytes and stimulated glucose oxidation and lipogenesis in isolated adipocytes from young rats. The bioactivity was neutralized in the presence of anti-insulin antibodies, but not in the presence of normal guinea pig IgG. The role of this insulin-like material in plants is unknown but its existence is consistent with an early evolutionary origin of the insulin messenger peptide family.

4019458,"A sialic acid-binding lectin with high specificity for 9-O-acetyl- and 4-O-acetylsialic acids was purified from the hemolymph of the California coastal crab, Cancer antennarius, by affinity chromatography using bovine submaxillary mucin coupled to agarose. The binding specificity of the crab lectin distinguishes it from other known sialic acid-specific lectins from Limulus polyphemus and Limax flavus which show a broader range of specificity for sialic acids. The purified lectin is homogenous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electropherograms with a subunit molecular weight of about 36 kDa. The specificity of the lectin for O-acetylsialic acids appears to account for the fact that it agglutinates mouse, rat, rabbit, and horse erythrocytes, which contain O-acetylsialic acids on cell surface glycoconjugates, but not human monkey, sheep, goat, and chicken erythrocytes which contain only NeuAc or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc). This conclusion was supported by the potent inhibition of hemagglutination by bovine and equine submaxillary mucins which contain 9(7,8)-O-acetyl- and 4-O-acetylsialic acids, respectively, and also by free 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (9-O-Ac-NeuAc) and 4-O-Ac-NeuAc relative to NeuAc and NeuGc.

6325646,"The role of dietary calcium and phosphorus in modifying the intestinal absorption of lead and also the effect of lead ingestion on the metabolism of cholecalciferol were studied in chicks. The efficiency of absorption of 203Pb and 47Ca was increased when the animals were fed a low calcium diet and treated with cholecalciferol. The synthesis of the vitamin D-induced calcium-binding protein (CaBP) was correspondingly increased. When the chicks were depleted of vitamin D and repleted with 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3] as their only source of the vitamin, the absorption of both 47Ca and 203Pb was unaffected by dietary calcium levels, and no change in CaBP levels occurred. Low dietary intake of phosphorus resulted in an increase in 47Ca and 203Pb absorption and in CaBP synthesis when the animals were treated with cholecalciferol. However, when the birds were repleted with 1,25(OH)2D3, the intestinal absorption of 47Ca and of 203Pb was increased, as well as the intestinal CaBP levels. Intracardial injection of increasing doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 to rachitic chicks resulted in a concomitant increase in 203Pb absorption in a manner that correlated with the degree of synthesis of CaBP. Ingestion of lead by the chicks was found to impair growth and renal production of 1,25(OH)2D3, resulting in lowered circulating and intestinal content of the hydroxylated metabolites of cholecalciferol.",The Journal of nutrition,"['D000818', 'D002117', 'D002132', 'D002136', 'D002645', 'D002762', 'D002851', 'D004386', 'D007408', 'D007854', 'D011868', 'D064030', 'D013977']","['Animals', 'Calcitriol', 'Calcium Radioisotopes', 'Calcium, Dietary', 'Chickens', 'Cholecalciferol', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Duodenum', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Lead', 'Radioisotopes', 'S100 Calcium Binding Protein G', 'Tibia']",Gastrointestinal absorption of lead in chicks: involvement of the cholecalciferol endocrine system.,"[None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000096', 'Q000378']","[None, 'pharmacology', None, 'metabolism', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, 'biosynthesis', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6325646,1984

There were 8 groups of 10 male chicks per lead level. Eight chicks from each dietary lead level were killed at 21 days, and hepatic fatty acid composition was determined for each chick by gas-liquid chromatography. Increasing dietary lead levels decreased the concentrations of 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acids (first No. = No. carbons; second No. = No. double bonds) and increased the concentrations of 18:0 and 20:4. The concentration of 18:2 fatty acids did not differ significantly from control values for any level of lead. However, the ratio 18:2/20:4 declined from a control value of 3.3 to approximately 2 for all lead treatments. The ratio of saturated/monoenoic fatty acids increased with dietary lead levels above 1000 ppm. In a second experiment 10 male broiler chicks per treatment were fed either a control diet or the control diet plus 2000 ppm lead, 60 ppm cadmium, 500 ppm mercury, or 10 ppm selenium (as Pb acetate X 3 H2O, CdSO4, HgCl2, or Na2SeO3, respectively) for 21 days. Six chicks from each group were killed at 21 days, and hepatic fatty acid composition was determined for each chick. In comparison to control, the ratio 18:2/20:4 was lowered by lead but unaffected by cadmium, mercury, and selenium.

The method is based on preliminary oxidation of cystine and methionine by performic acid and transformation of these substances to acid hydrolysis resistant cysteic acid and methionine sulphone. Model experiments and use of foods (wheat flour, grade II, and protein part of chicken egg) demonstrated that exposure of proteins to performic acid brings about oxidation of sulfur-containing amino acids to the hydrolysis-resistant forms which may be defined by chromatography with a greater accuracy. Experiments without preliminary oxidation by performic acid showed that foods experience an appreciable destruction (by 30-60%) of cystine and methionine.

Yields from the reverse-phase support were typically 60-70% for the isoproteins.

6817824,"This report deals with some of the biological and chemical properties of a liposoluble poison extracted from Caranx bartholomaei (yellow jack), a toxic fish from the French West Indies (St Barth's island). Within a single fish, poison concentration is higher in the viscera; toxicity level is uniform throughout the flesh. In the few specimens tested, liver toxicity variations parallel those of flesh. The poison is heat stable so that cooking does not impair the toxicity. It is soluble in acetone, diethyl ether, chloroform, benzene, methanol and ethanol, but insoluble in n. hexane. Crude toxin injection or ingestion induces ciguateric disease in cats, mice or newly born chicken. Crude toxin stability is good after 30 minutes at 90 degrees C in a 0,5 N solution of a weak acid but not of a weak base. In the same conditions, loss of activity is nearly complete with a strong acid or a strong base. Moreover, rapid alkali treatment at room temperature destroys more than 50 per cent of the toxicity. The toxin is eluted by chloroform-methanol (9:1) from a silicic acid column and by acetone-methanol (9,5:0,5) from a Florisil column. DEAE cellulose column chromatography clearly separates the toxin into two lethal components; but thin layer chromatography of crude or fractionated toxin indicates only one toxic band in three different solvent systems. As a conclusion, in spite of a few differences related to instability in alkalin medium and elution from DEAE cellulose, this poison is quite similar to those carried by ciguatoxic fishes from the Pacific area.

7061507,"25-Hydroxy-24-oxovitamin D3 (25(OH)24-oxo-D3), a metabolite of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, has been chemically synthesized. The ultraviolet, mass, infrared, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the 25(OH)24-oxo-D3 were identical with those of the natural product isolated from chick kidney incubates. The oxo compound showed biological activity similar to 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3) in vitamin D-deficient chicks in enhancing intestinal calcium transport and bone calcium mobilization activities. Although 25(OH)24-oxo-D3 partially restored the impaired eggshell weights of Japanese quails fed a vitamin D-deficient diet, it was much less potent than 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 or 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In addition, there was no effect on the calcification of medullary bone. When 25(OH)24-oxo[3H]D3 was incubated with kidney homogenates from vitamin D-deficient chicks, it was metabolized to [3H]1 alpha, 24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 and a metabolite which was eluted in a region between authentic 24R,25(OH)2D3 and 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on high pressure liquid chromatography. In the incubates of kidney homogenates from vitamin D-supplemented chicks, those metabolites were not detected. In vitamin D-supplemented chicks, the recovery of radioactivity in the chloroform phase extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer was only 50%, while that in vitamin D-deficient chicks was 87%. Moreover, the radioactivity eluted in the 25(OH)24-oxo-D3 fraction from vitamin D-supplemented chicks was only one-fifth of that from vitamin D-deficient birds.

The control group was kept in similar conditions, receiving a bare piece of food. Blood was taken on empty stomach from the heart on heparin. With the methods adopted the following were examined in the plasma: total cholesterol, triglycerides, total fat and beta-lipoproteins. After bleeding the birds, extracts from the aorta intima and media and maturing egg cell yolk balls were made by the method of Folch et al., and then they were analysed with thin-layer chromatography on silica gel (Kieselgel-Fertigplatten DC Merck). Following densimetric measurements, the results obtained were statistically analysed, tabled and plotted in chromatograms. In general, almost a double concentration increase in the total cholesterol and fat, triglycerides and beta-lipoproteins was observed in comparison with control group. In the aorta analysed chromatographically, the mean level of phospholipids, free fatty acids, triglycerides and ester cholesterol increased almost twice, and that of monoglycerides ten times. In egg cell yolk more than a double increase in the level of phospholipids, triple of monoglycerides and over triple of free cholesterol and fatty acids, over quadruple of triglycerides and over sevenfold of free cholesterol was observed.

711769,"A scheme is presented for cloning a double-stranded cDNA molecule that codes for a portion of chicken preproalbumin. This method, which does not require pure mRNA or cDNA, has widespread applicability. Chicken preproalbumin was identified as a Mr = 72,000 polypeptide by immunoprecipitation of proteins synehesized in a wheat germ cell-free translation system from total, guanidine.HCl-extracted, rooster liver RNA. After removal of the bulk of the ribosomal RNA by poly(U)-Sephadex G-10 chromatography, albumin mRNA was enriched approximately 2-fold by centrifugation through low salt, isokinetic sucrose gradients, until it represented about 30% of the mRNA sequences present. Double-stranded cDNA prepared from this mRNA was then inserted into the Pst 1 site of the plasmid PBR322 by the ""G-C tailing"" technique and the recombinant DNA was used to transform Echerichia coli stran X1776. Transformants containing putative albumin DNA sequences were identified by colony hybridization with a cDNA probe that was highly enriched for albumin cDNA sequences. This probe was isolated by hybridizing the partially purified RNA preparation to its cDNA, under conditions of RNA excess, to a R0t value such that only the most abundant cDNA sequences had hybridized. Unhybridized, less abundant, sequences were destroyed by subsequent S1 nuclease digestion.

321457,"Mercurated UTP was used as a substrate for RNA polymerases in the in vitro transcription of chromatin so that newly synthesized RNA could be efficiently separated from endogenous chromatin RNA by means of sulfhydryl-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Utilizing this technique, it was possible to examine the effect of varying enzyme to DNA ratios on the transcription of specific genes from chromatin. For both Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and wheat germ RNA polymerase II, lowering the enzyme to DNA ration resulted in an increase in the percentage of ovalbumin mRNA sequences transcribed from chick oviduct chromatin. Similar results were also obtained for the transcription of the globin gene from chick reticulocyte chromatin. On the other hand, transcription of the globin gene from oviduct chromatin or the ovalbumin gene from reticulocyte chromatin or deproteinized chick DNA was not significantly affected by varying enzyme to DNA ratios. These results indicate that preferential transcription of certain chromatin genes relative to total RNA synthesis can occur and that this process is dependent on the presence of chromosomal proteins. Utilizing a cDNA probe complementary to the anticoding strand of the ovalbumin gene, the degree of asymmetry of the in vitro transcription of this gene was also examined. The percentage of ovalbumin RNA sequences homologous to the anticoding strand was not significantly affected when the enzyme to DNA ratio was lowered 16-fold. Since the percentage of coding ovalbumin mRNA sequences increased more than 6-fold over the same range, the percentage of asymmetric transcription of this gene increased. At the lowest enzyme to DNA ratio tested, the transcription of the ovalbumin gene from oviduct chromatin was almost totally asymmetric and, thus, closely resembled the pattern of gene transcription characteristic of the in vivo state.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002645', 'D002843', 'D012321', 'D004054', 'D004926', 'D005260', 'D005796', 'D005914', 'D007700', 'D009693', 'D010047', 'D010057', 'D010944', 'D014176', 'D012333', 'D012156', 'D014158', 'D014908']","['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases', 'Diethylstilbestrol', 'Escherichia coli', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Globins', 'Kinetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Ovalbumin', 'Oviducts', 'Plants', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reticulocytes', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Triticum']",Effect of estrogen on gene expression in the chick oviduct.,"[None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000494', 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000096', None, None, 'Q000096', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', 'enzymology', None, None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, 'biosynthesis', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/321457,1977

4530996,"Cytoplasmic polyadenylylated messenger RNA from differentiated muscle cultures, when incubated in a wheat germ cell-free system, directed the synthesis of a polypeptide indistinguishable from authentic chicken skeletal muscle actin, as judged by mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, tryptic peptide analyses, and biological activity. The synthesis of actin in the cell-free system was used to assay levels of translatable actin mRNA in cultures of fibroblasts, pre- and post-fusion myoblasts, and myoblasts grown under conditions that prevent fusion. In all cases the amount of actin polypeptide synthesized in the cell-free system was proportional to the rate of actin synthesis in the cultures from which the RNA was extracted. It is suggested that actin synthesis is regulated by the actin mRNA content of the cell and that an increase in the cytoplasmic level of translatable actin messenger RNA is mediated by cell fusion rather than by the terminal round of DNA synthesis.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"['D000199', 'D000227', 'D000818', 'D002454', 'D002474', 'D002478', 'D002642', 'D002852', 'D003593', 'D004591', 'D005347', 'D007700', 'D008715', 'D009132', 'D010452', 'D010936', 'D011119', 'D014176', 'D012333', 'D013462', 'D014908', 'D014316']","['Actins', 'Adenine Nucleotides', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cytoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fibroblasts', 'Kinetics', 'Methionine', 'Muscles', 'Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Plant Extracts', 'Polynucleotides', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Triticum', 'Tritium']",Determination of actin messenger RNA in cultures of differentiating embryonic chick skeletal muscle.,"['Q000096', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000166', None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None]","['biosynthesis', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'cytology', None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4530996,1975

6077418,"The small intestine of 3-week-old gnotobiotic chicks was divided into five equal segments for analysis. Since it has been found that most fat absorption occurs in the third and fourth segments, they were selected for study. The major fatty acids in the diet and the feces of chicks were palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids. Consequently, these fatty acids were selected for quantitative analyses in the absorption studies. Germ-free chicks were contaminated at 7 days of age with bacteria isolated from the third and fourth intestinal segments, except for the Escherichia coli contaminant, which had been previously isolated from a chicken with air sac disease. There were two different degrees of response by chicks to the bacterial contaminants in this study. For this reason, the chicks were placed retrospectively into two categories according to their response to environmental conditions. The first category (A) contained germ-free chicks and chicks monocontaminated with E. coli, Staphylococcus, or Lactobacillus. The second category (B) was composed of conventional chicks and chicks monocontaminated with Streptococcus faecalis or Clostridium welchii, dicontaminated with S. faecalis and C. welchii, and accidentally polycontaminated with coliforms and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli. Chicks in category A demonstrated increased absorption of palmitic and stearic acids and total fat as compared to category B chicks. Conversely, category B chicks showed slightly increased absorption of oleic and linoleic acids.
