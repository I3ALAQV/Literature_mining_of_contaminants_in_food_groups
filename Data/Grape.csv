35336301,"Samples from various winemaking stages of the production of sparkling wines using different grape varieties were characterized based on the profile of biogenic amines (BAs) and the elemental composition. Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) combined with precolumn derivatization with dansyl chloride was used to quantify BAs, while inductively coupled plasma (ICP) techniques were applied to determine a wide range of elements. Musts, base wines, and sparkling wines were analyzed accordingly, and the resulting data were subjected to further chemometric studies to try to extract information on oenological practices, product quality, and varieties. Although good descriptive models were obtained when considering each type of data separately, the performance of data fusion approaches was assessed as well. In this regard, low-level and mid-level approaches were evaluated, and from the results, it was concluded that more comprehensive models can be obtained when joining data of different natures.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","['D001679', 'D002851', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Biogenic Amines', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Data Fusion Approaches for the Characterization of Musts and Wines Based on Biogenic Amine and Elemental Composition.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35336301,2022

This study aims to investigate high-power sonication to improve polyphenolic content in cold-hardy grape juice in comparison with chokeberry juice. Three solid to solvent ratios and times were applied on chokeberry and 'Marquette' grape berries using 50% ethanol or 13% acidified ethanol and compared to a conventional extraction technique. Iron-reactive phenolic compounds, tannins content, and color were analyzed during the extractions using UV-Visible spectrophotometry, and anthocyanin content was analyzed using HPLC-DAD. At the 1:2 solid to solvent ratio, the color intensity, phenolics, and tannins content were improved using the ultrasound-assisted extraction on chokeberries. However, the tannin content of 'Marquette' berries remained the same with both techniques and solvents, suggesting that the plant cell wall structure may have a strong impact on the retention of tannins from cold-hardy grapes.",Food chemistry,[],[],Optimization of the ultrasound-assisted extraction of polyphenols from Aronia and grapes.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35334320,2022

However, using these algorithms, few mitochondrion-encoded circRNAs (mcircRNAs) have been identified in plants, and the role of plant mcircRNAs has not yet been addressed. Here, we developed a circRNA identification algorithm, mitochondrion-encoded circRNA identifier (MeCi), based on common features of plant mitochondrial genomes. We identified 7,524, 9,819, 1,699, 1,821, 1,809, and 5,133 mcircRNAs in maize (Zea mays), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), and grape (Vitis vinifera), respectively. These mcircRNAs were experimentally validated. Plant mcircRNAs had distinct characteristics from ncircRNAs, and they were more likely to be derived from RNA degradation but not intron backsplicing. Alternative circularization was prevalent in plant mitochondria, and most parental genomic regions hosted multiple mcircRNA isoforms, which have homogenous 5' termini but heterogeneous 3' ends. By analysis of mitopolysome and mitoribosome profiling data, 1,463 mcircRNAs bound to ribosomes were detected in maize and Arabidopsis. Further analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data identified 358 mcircRNA-derived polypeptides. Overall, we developed a computational pipeline that efficiently identifies plant mcircRNAs, and we demonstrated mcircRNAs are widespread and translated in plants.",Plant physiology,[],[],Mitochondrion-encoded circular RNAs are widespread and translatable in plants.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35325205,2022

In this context, the current work aimed to evaluate the fatty acids (FAs) profile using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), as well as the determination of related health lipid indices (e.g., atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI)) as a powerful strategy to investigate the potential applications of different agri-food by-products for human nutrition and animal feeding. This work results showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the predominant group in grape pomace (72.7%), grape bunches (54.3%), and brewer's spent grain (BSG, 59.0%), whereas carrot peels are dominated by monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs, 47.3%), and grape stems (46.2%), lees (from 50.8 to 74.1%), and potato peels (77.2%) by saturated fatty acids (SFAs). These findings represent a scientific basis for exploring the nutritional properties of agri-food by-products. Special attention should be given to grape pomace, grape bunches, and BSG since they have a high content of PUFAs (from 54.3 to 72.7%) and lower AI (from 0.11 to 0.38) and TI (from 0.30 to 0.56) indexes, suggesting their potential to provide a variety of health benefits against cardiovascular diseases including well-established hypotriglyceridemia and anti-inflammatory effects, products to which they are added.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Evaluation of Fatty Acids Profile as a Useful Tool towards Valorization of By-Products of Agri-Food Industry.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34829147,2021

Their proportions in wine are dependent on grape composition and winemaking conditions (temperature, pH levels, oxygen, and carbon dioxide concentration). Therefore, this article studied the influence of different fermentation conditions (200 hL tanks vs. 50 L glass demijohns) and various yeasts on the evolution of the main organic acids during alcoholic fermentation of ""Aligoté"" wines. The fermentation lasted 22 days and samples were collected daily. Laboratory analyses were quantified according to the International Organization of Vine and Wine recommendations. High-performance liquid chromatography for the identification and quantification of organic acids was used. The data showed the important effect of winemaking conditions on sugar consumption, density or acidity values, and sensory characteristics. Significant differences in organic acid concentrations (especially for tartaric acid) were obtained for all variants, depending on the fermentation conditions, inoculated yeast and the sampling moment. The quantities of most of the identified organic acids were generally significantly increased when glass vessels were used, compared to those fermented in tanks. Most organic acids concentrations were favored by lower pH and showed higher values at lower temperatures.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Effect of Different Winemaking Conditions on Organic Acids Compounds of White Wines.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34828850,2021

These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) attract natural enemies of the herbivores and repel or attract conspecific adult herbivores in a tri-trophic interaction which has been considered to be an indirect plant defense against herbivores. Recently, we demonstrated the attraction of male and female European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) to a blend of phenylacetonitrile and acetic acid, two compounds identified as HIPVs in heterospecific apple-leafroller interactions. The ecological basis of our findings is not clearly understood. Thus, this work was undertaken to investigate HIPVs in the grapevine-leafroller interaction and study the response of heterospecific adults L. botrana, to these volatiles. We collected headspace volatiles emitted from uninfested grapevines and grapevines infested with larvae of a generalist herbivore, the grapevine leafroller moth, Sparganothis pilleriana (Denis & Schiffermüller), and analyzed them using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Infested grape leaves released three compounds (phenylacetonitrile, indole, and 2-phenylethanol) not found from uninfested leaves. Nine different blends, comprising a full factorial set of the three compounds with each blend containing acetic acid, were tested in a field-cage trial. Only lures containing phenylacetonitrile caused a significant increase in trap catches compared to the other lures and blank traps.

A total of 240 samples of bovine incisor teeth were used for the erosive challenge and allocated in groups. Digestion of drinks was performed using microwave-assisted digestion. The content in acidic drinks was monitored before and after the erosive challenge at exposure times of 1, 5, and 60 min using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). The drinks' pH varied slightly during the erosive challenge but remained below the critical value of pH 5 to cause tooth demineralization. The concentrations of elements released from the bovine incisors during the in vitro erosive challenge depend on exposure times when immersed in acidic beverages. For some elements such as Ca, Mn, Zn, Fe, Cu, Ba, Pb, As, and Cd, quantified in acidic drinks, grape juice had greater erosive potential than Coca-Cola™ and orange juice. Quantification and monitoring of chemical elements in bovine teeth can be performed considering a longer erosive time and other types of acidic drinks.

34205651,"High-pressure processing (HPP) has emerged over the last 2 decades as a good alternative to traditional thermal treatment for food safety and shelf-life extension, supplying foods with similar characteristics to those of fresh products. Currently, HPP has also been proposed as a useful tool to reduce food contaminants, such as pesticides and mycotoxins. The aim of the present study is to explore the effect of HPP technology at 600 MPa during 5 min at room temperature on alternariol (AOH) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) mycotoxins reduction in different juice models. The effect of HPP has also been compared with a thermal treatment performed at 90 °C during 21 s. For this, different juice models, orange juice/milk beverage, strawberry juice/milk beverage and grape juice, were prepared and spiked individually with AOH and AFB1 at a concentration of 100 µg/L. After HPP and thermal treatments, mycotoxins were extracted from treated samples and controls by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and determined by HPLC-MS/MS-IT. The results obtained revealed reduction percentages up to 24% for AFB1 and 37% for AOH. Comparing between different juice models, significant differences were observed for AFB1 residues in orange juice/milk versus strawberry juice/milk beverages after HPP treatment.

34077875,"In grape cell cultures cv. Gamay Fréaux var. Teinturier, Ca was shown to decrease cell pigmentation through the inhibition of anthocyanin biosynthesis, while stimulating stilbenoids accumulation. Because methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a well-known inducer of secondary metabolism in grape cells, and Ca antagonizes its stimulatory effect over several enzymes of core metabolic branches, in the present study we hypothesized that Ca and MeJA signaling pathways interact to regulate specific secondary metabolism routes. Grape cultured cells were elicited with MeJA or with MeJA + Ca and an UPLC-MS-based targeted metabolomic method was implemented to characterize their polyphenolic profiles. Results were compared with the profile of cells elicited with Ca only, previously reported. Data was complemented with gene expression analysis, allowing the assembly of a metabolic map that unraveled routes specifically regulated by both elicitors. MeJA + Ca specifically boosted E-resveratrol and E-ε-viniferin levels by 180% and 140%, respectively, in comparison to cells treated with MeJA only, while the stimulatory effect of MeJA over flavonoid synthesis was inhibited by Ca. In parallel, Ca downregulated most flavonoid pathway genes, including LAR1, ANS, BAN and ANR. Ca was able to mimic or potentiate the effect of MeJA on the expression of JA signaling genes, including JAR1, PIN and PR10. Transcript/metabolite correlation networks exposed the central influence of FLS1,STS,CDPK17 and COI1 in polyphenolic biosynthetic routes.

The study aimed to utilize sinapic acid and grape tannins in cherry wine to maintain a high fraction in the colored forms of anthocyanins, in order to maximize the color intensity, the latter being associated with good product quality. The effects on the anthocyanin profile and on color parameters of copigments, utilizing spectral measurement combined with UPLC-MS quantitative analysis, have been evaluated in sweet cherry wines. The copigmentation effect of sinapic acid and grape tannin was accompanied by the bathochromic shift and the hyperchromic effect, which lead to an increase in color intensity (lower L*, higher a* and b*). During the aging process, sinapic and grape tannin increased the content of pyranoanthocyanins in cherry wine, especially the addition of sinapic acid makes the cherry wine generate 10-syringyl-pyranocyanidin-3-rutinoside.

Aqueous extracts at different pHs (1-13) were prepared from ""Aglianico"", ""Fiano"", and ""Greco"" grape canes. The results demonstrated that an alkaline pH (13.00) produced the best polyphenol-rich extracts, as the total phenolic content was more than double when compared to the respective extracts prepared at pH 1.00. ""Greco"" grape canes gave the highest quantity of phenolic compounds at each pH, ranging from 42.7 ± 0.4 to 104.3 ± 3.0 mg Gallic Acid Equivalents (GAE)/g Dry Extract (DE) from pH 1.00 to 13.00. The Radical Scavenging Activity (RSA) and the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) were measured. The highest antioxidant activity was showed by ""Greco"" extract at pH 7.00. Seventy-five compounds were identified in the extracts by HPLC-MS with six of them described for the first time in grape canes. Procyanidins were highly abundant in extracts at pH 7.00, whereas stilbenoids were the most represented compounds at pH 13.00. Very strong antiviral activity against herpes simplex viruses was recorded for the extracts at pH 7.00 and 13.00 that were active in the early stages of infection by acting directly against the viral particles.

Pesticides are extracted from raisins with ethyl acetate, followed by centrifugation. The validation study was in accordance with DG SANTE guidelines. Validation experiments have been performed in both analytical instruments. A total number of 314 pesticides were spiked in raisins of organic farming at two spiking levels for GC-MS/MS (0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg), and at three spiking levels for LC-MS/MS (0.005, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg) with 6 replicates at each concentration. The scope of validation included linearity, limits of quantification (LOQ), accuracy, precision, and matrix effects (%) for each pesticide. The validated method was then applied for the analysis of 37 commercial raisin samples purchased from the market. For the evaluation of the results, processing factors (PFs) have been applied to derive the amount of residue in raisins, from the maximum residue levels (MRLs) of grapes, and which in this paper will be referred as to the MRL expressed in raisins. In all conventional samples, pesticides were detected at concentrations above the LOQ. In total, 55 different pesticides were detected. All conventional samples contained multiple pesticides ranging from 2 to 24. On the other hand, samples from organic farming were found to be free of the analysed pesticides. The 13.5% of the examined samples were considered as violations.

33992334,"Hutai-8 (Vitis vinifera × Vitis labrusca) is a table grape widely cultivated in China. In order to determine the changes in volatile profile and aroma potential during berry ripening, a total of 84 free and 73 bound aroma compounds were identified and quantified using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). Aldehydes and esters were found to be the main volatile compounds in Hutai-8. They accumulated up to 70 days after flowering (DAF) and then decreased. Bound esters and alcohols were prominent. The concentration of bound esters in Hutai-8 at DAF80 was 714.90 µg/L. β-Damascenone, hexanal, (E)-2-hexenal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, (E)-2-nonenal, and ethyl octanoate significantly contributed to the volatile profile of Hutai-8. The odor activity value (OAV) of hexanal was the highest at DAF80, reaching 351.51. β-Damascenone mainly appeared midway through the maturation process, reaching a concentration of 12.79 µg/L. The majority of free components reached a maximum in DAF70, while the bound components continuously accumulated throughout the mature period. These results suggest that in addition to being a table grape, Hutai-8 has potential for brewing and other processing.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D002681', 'D005638', 'D009812', 'D027843', 'D055549']","['China', 'Fruit', 'Odorants', 'Vitis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Evolution of volatile profile and aroma potential of table grape Hutai-8 during berry ripening.,"[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992334,2021

Adsorption and desorption tests were conducted by mixing a commercial seed tannin with purified skin cell-walls from Syrah grapes, in the presence or absence of hydrolytic enzymes, in a model-wine solution. The effects of the enzymes were evaluated by measuring the tannins in solution by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and the changes in the cell wall polysaccharide network by Comprehensive Microarray Polymer Profiling (COMPP) while the polysaccharides liberated from cell walls were analyzed by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). The results showed that the enzymes limited the interaction between tannins and cell walls, especially cellulase, pectinase and xylanase, an effect associated with the cell wall structural modifications caused by the enzymes, which reduced their capacity to bind tannins. With regards to the tannin desorption process, enzymes did not play a significant role in liberating bound tannins. Those enzymes that showed the highest effect in limiting the adsorption of tannins and in disorganizing the cell wall structure, cellulase and pectinase, did not lead to a desorption of bound tannins, although they still showed a capacity of affecting cell wall structure. The results indicate that enzymes are not able to access those polysaccharides where tannins are bound, thus, they are not a useful tool for desorbing tannins from cell walls.

33406611,"Wine is one of the most popular alcoholic beverages. Therefore, the control of the elemental composition is necessary throughout the entire production process from the grapes to the final product. The content of some elements in wine is very important from the organoleptic and nutritional points of view. Nowadays, wine studies have also been undertaken in order to perform wine categorization and/or to verify the authenticity of products. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of the chosen factors (type of wine, producer, origin) on the levels of 28 elements in 180 wine samples. The concentration of studied elements was determined by ICP-MS (Ag, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sn, Sr, Te, Tl, U, Zn), ICP-OES (Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Ti), and CVAAS (Hg) techniques in 79 red, 75 white, and 26 rose wine samples. In general, red wines contained higher values of mean and median of B, Ba, Cr, Cu, Mn, Sr and Zn in contrast to other wine types (white and rose). In white wines (when compared to red and rose wines) higher levels of elements such as Ag, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Li, K and Ti were determined. In contrast, rose wines were characterized by a higher concentration of Fe and U. The study also revealed that in the case of 18 samples, the maximum levels of some metals (Cd-8 samples, Pb-9 samples, Cu-1 sample) were slightly exceeded according to the OIV standards, while for Zn and Ti in any wine sample the measured concentrations of these metals were above the permissible levels. Thus, it can be stated that the studied wines contained, in general, lower levels of heavy metals, suggesting that they should have no effect on the safety of consumption. The results also showed higher pH level for red wines as a consequence of the second fermentation process which is typically carried out for this type of wine (malolactic fermentation). The highest median value of pH was reported for Merlot-based wines, while the lowest was for Riesling. It is assumed that dry Riesling has a higher content of tartaric and malic acid than dry Chardonnay grown in the same climate. From all of the studied countries, wines from Poland seemed to present one of the most characteristic elemental fingerprints since for many elements relatively low levels were recorded. Moreover, this study revealed that also wine samples from USA and Australia can be potentially discriminated from the rest of studied wines. For USA the most characteristic metal for positive identification of the country of origin seems to be uranium, whereases for Australia - strontium and manganese. Based on the highly reduced set of samples, it was not possible to differentiate the studied wine products according to the grape variety other than Syrah, and partially Chardonnay. Since all the Syrah-based samples originated from the same country (Australia) thus, the observed grouping should be more related with the country of origin than the grape variety.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D001315', 'D005285', 'D013058', 'D019216', 'D011044', 'D014131', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Australia', 'Fermentation', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Poland', 'Trace Elements', 'Vitis', 'Wine']","Multi-Elemental Analysis of Wine Samples in Relation to Their Type, Origin, and Grape Variety.","[None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33406611,2021

In this study, we investigate the development of novel detection and on-line monitoring approaches for the detection of OTA in the field (i.e. out of the chemical laboratory) using advanced molecular sensing. Both stand-alone and hyphenated mass spectrometry (MS) based systems (e.g. Time-of-Flight ToF-MS and gas chromatography GC combined with MS) and compact portable membrane inlet MS (MIMS) have been employed for the first time to detect and monitor volatile emissions of grape berries infected by the fungus Aspergillus carbonarius. In vacuo (electron impact-EI) and ambient ionisation (electrospray ionisation-ESI) techniques were also examined. On-line measurements of the volatile emissions of grape berries, infected by various strains of A. carbonarius with different toxicity levels, were performed resulting in different olfactory chemical profiles with a common core of characteristic mass fragments, which could be eventually used for on-site detection and monitoring allowing consequent improvement in food security.",Scientific reports,"['D001230', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D010935', 'D021241', 'D013997', 'D027843', 'D055549']","['Aspergillus', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Plant Diseases', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Time Factors', 'Vitis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Analysis of volatile emissions from grape berries infected with Aspergillus carbonarius using hyphenated and portable mass spectrometry.,"['Q000502', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000382', None, None, 'Q000382', 'Q000032']","['physiology', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'microbiology', None, None, 'microbiology', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33273624,2021

The range of concentrations in which many of these compounds are found is quite low, in concentrations of ng/L; due to this, a sample preparation stage is necessary before doing the chromatographic analysis of the volatile compounds. In this review, the main analytical techniques used for the extraction of volatile compounds in grapes and wines are studied. The techniques presented are liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), solid phase extraction (SPE), solid phase microextraction (SPME), stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), and thin film solid phase microextraction (TF-SPME). For each of these techniques, a description was made, and the different characteristics were numbered, as well as their main advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, from the second technique, a comparison is made with the previous techniques, explaining the reasons why new techniques have emerged.

The three detection assays are based on optical transduction, with the detection of salicylic and azelaic acids using transmission measurements, while the detection of jasmonic acid is a fluorescence-based assay.

The sensory properties of sparkling wine depend on a complex interplay between the chemical and biochemical components in the final product. Glycoproteins have been linked to positive and negative qualities in sparkling wine, but the glycosylation profiles of sparkling wine have not been previously investigated in detail. We analyzed the glycoproteome of sparkling wines using protein- and glycopeptide-centric approaches. We developed an automated workflow that created ion libraries to analyze sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry data based on glycopeptides identified by Byonic (Protein Metrics; version 2.13.17). We applied our workflow to three pairs of experimental sparkling wines to assess the effects of aging on lees and of different yeast strains used in the liqueur de tirage for secondary fermentation. We found that aging a cuvée on lees for 24 months compared with 8 months led to a dramatic decrease in overall protein abundance and an enrichment in large glycans at specific sites in some proteins. Secondary fermentation of a Riesling wine with Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain Siha4 produced more yeast proteins and glycoproteins than with S. cerevisiae yeast strain DV10. The abundance and glycosylation profiles of grape glycoproteins were also different between grape varieties.

In this work we fully characterized the polyphenolic profile of two grape skin extracts (GSEs), Autumn Royal and Egnatia, and assessed their effects on Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) membrane levels of Caco2 and SW480 human colon cancer cell lines. Gene expression of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), as well as cell morphology, were evaluated. The polyphenolic composition was analyzed by Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography/Quadrupole-Time of Flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/QTOF) analysis. PUFA levels were evaluated by gas chromatography, and gene expression levels of 15-LOX-1 and PPAR-γ were analyzed by real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Morphological cell changes caused by GSEs were identified by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and photomicrograph examination. We detected a different profile of flavonoid and non-flavonoid compounds in Autumn Royal and Egnatia GSEs. Cultured cells showed an increase of total PUFA levels mainly after treatment with Autumn Royal grape, and were richer in flavonoids when compared with the Egnatia variety.

Eighty-eight metabolites showed significantly different concentration and 432 genes showed differential expression between inoculated resistant leaves and controls. Most metabolite changes in sugars, fatty acids and phenols were similar in timing and direction to those observed in Rpv3-mediated ETI but some of them were stronger or more persistent. Activators, elicitors and signal transducers for the formation of reactive oxygen species were early observed in samples undergoing Rpv12-mediated ETI and were paralleled and followed by the upregulation of genes belonging to ontology categories associated with salicylic acid signalling, signal transduction, WRKY transcription factors and synthesis of PR-1, PR-2, PR-5 pathogenesis-related proteins.",Scientific reports,"['D030541', 'D060467', 'D008401', 'D018506', 'D023281', 'D055442', 'D044742', 'D010935', 'D018515', 'D010940', 'D025341', 'D018749', 'D000081246', 'D027843']","['Databases, Genetic', 'Disease Resistance', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genomics', 'Metabolome', 'Peronospora', 'Plant Diseases', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Proteins', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'RNA, Plant', 'RNA-Seq', 'Vitis']",Two-omics data revealed commonalities and differences between Rpv12- and Rpv3-mediated resistance in grapevine.,"[None, 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000302', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378']","[None, 'genetics', None, None, 'methods', None, 'isolation & purification', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'genetics', None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699241,2020

In this work, a herbal preparation consisting of propolis, pomegranate peel, and Aglianico grape pomace (PPP) extracts (4:1:1) was designed and evaluated for its effect on a murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Firstly, the chemical contents of four different Italian propolis collected in the Campania region (Italy) were here reported for the first time.

The Pietradefusi extract was the richest one and thus was selected to design the PPP preparation for the in vivo assay. Our results highlight the impact of PPP on RA onset and progression. By using in vivo CIA models, the treatment with PPP resulted in a delayed onset of the disease and alleviated the severity of the clinical symptoms. Furthermore, we demonstrated that early PPP treatment was associated with a reduction in serum levels of IL-17, IL-1b, and IL-17-triggering cytokines.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000818', 'D000893', 'D001172', 'D002853', 'D003094', 'D005260', 'D005419', 'D062385', 'D007249', 'D020381', 'D053583', 'D013058', 'D051379', 'D008811', 'D028321', 'D000079702', 'D011429', 'D027843']","['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Collagen', 'Female', 'Flavonoids', 'Hydroxybenzoates', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-17', 'Interleukin-1beta', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Plant Preparations', 'Pomegranate', 'Propolis', 'Vitis']","A Herbal Mixture from Propolis, Pomegranate, and Grape Pomace Endowed with Anti-Inflammatory Activity in an In Vivo Rheumatoid Arthritis Model.","[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000139', None, 'Q000633', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000188', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'chemically induced', None, 'toxicity', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'drug therapy', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403241,2021

Grape pomace extracts are a rich source of polyphenols. In the present study, the polyphenols of two different types of grape pomace were characterized and identified by high‑performance liquid chromatography‑diode array detector, and the effect of polyphenol‑rich grape pomace extracts on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) osteogenic differentiation was investigated. Solid‑liquid extraction was used to recover polyphenols from red and white grape pomace. The two extracts have been characterized through the phenolic content and antioxidant power. Human MSCs (hMSCs) from the bone marrow were cultured both with and without given amounts (10 or 20 µg/ml) of the obtained pomace extracts. Their effects on cell differentiation were evaluated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, compared with relevant controls. Results showed that both pomace extracts, albeit different in phenolic composition and concentration, induced multiple effects on hMSC gene expression, such as a decreased receptor activator of nuclear factor κ‑Β ligand/osteoprotegerin ratio and an enhanced expression of genes involved in osteoblast differentiation, thus suggesting a shift of hMSCs towards osteoblast differentiation.

32156353,"Establishing a fine wine image through regional typicality has been of interest to New World wine producing countries like Australia, but previous research mainly involved unoaked experimental wines, which were not reflective of the retail wine market. The regional typicality of commercially available fine Australian wines (FAW) was therefore explored, based on the hypotheses that sensory and chemical composition of varietal fine wines would discriminate by region, and further nuances within region would be explained by drivers of intraregional typicality. Chardonnay wines (2015 vintage) from Margaret River (MR, n = 16) and Yarra Valley (YV, n = 16); and Shiraz wines (2014 vintage) from Barossa Valley (BV, n = 16) and McLaren Vale (MV = 15), were selected for descriptive sensory analysis and underwent profiling of volatiles by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For both grape varieties, there was large variability in wine styles among wines from the same GI, such as fruity/crisp vs oaked Chardonnay and oaky/astringent vs savoury Shiraz. Consequently, human intervention seemed to be an important component of regional/sub-regional typicality, which therefore cannot be determined solely on geographic origin of the fruit. Using a combination of sensory markers and volatile profiles allowed the building of regional typicality models, which are promising, however, consumers may not perceive sub-regional differences based on sensory attributes. Undoubtedly, variation of wine styles emerging across wine regions, vintages, and viticultural and winemaking practices needs to be further explored, but this work created a preliminary sensory and volatile map for future research.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000328', 'D001315', 'D005260', 'D063427', 'D008401', 'D005843', 'D006801', 'D008297', 'D009812', 'D012903', 'D013649', 'D014920', 'D055815']","['Adult', 'Australia', 'Female', 'Food Quality', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Odorants', 'Smell', 'Taste', 'Wine', 'Young Adult']",A matter of place: Sensory and chemical characterisation of fine Australian Chardonnay and Shiraz wines of provenance.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32156353,2021

Thirty-six Sarda ewes were assigned to four treatments: control (CON; no by-product), 100 g/day of grape marc (GM), 100 g/day tomato pomace (TP) and 75 g/day of exhausted myrtle berries (EMBs). The superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in blood, and SOD, GR and lactoperoxidase (LPO) in milk were determined. Total antioxidant capacity (FRAP and ABTS assays), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls (PCs) were also measured. Milk fatty acid profile was investigated by gas chromatography. The results showed higher antioxidant capacity measured by FRAP or ABTS assays and a reduction in MDA in GM plasma than CON. All by-products enhanced the protection of milk proteins by oxidation, as evidenced by lower values of PCs compared with CON. GM supplementation increased PUFAn-6, due to increase in C18:2n-6, the main component of GM compared with CON. All by-products did not modify the nutritional indexes of milk fat.

Sedentary gall forming insects, such as grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch, Phylloxeridae), secrete multiple effectors into host plant tissues that alter or modulate the cellular and molecular environment to the benefit of the insect. The identification and characterisation of effector proteins will provide insight into the host-phylloxera interaction specifically the gall-induction processes and potential mechanisms of plant resistance. Using proteomic mass spectrometry and in-silico secretory prediction, 420 putative effectors were determined from the salivary glands or the root-feeding D. vitifoliae larvae reared on Teleki 5C (V. berlandieri x V. riparia). Among them, 170 conserved effectors were shared between D. vitifoliae and fourteen phytophagous insect species. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of five conserved effector candidates (protein disulfide-isomerase, peroxidoredoxin, peroxidase and a carboxypeptidase) revealed that their gene expression decreased, when larvae were starved for 24 h, supporting their assignment as effector molecules. The D. vitifoliae effectors identified here represent a functionally diverse group, comprising both conserved and unique proteins that provide new insight into the D. vitifoliae-Vitis spp. interaction and the potential mechanisms by which D. vitifoliae establishes the feeding site, suppresses plant defences and modulates nutrient uptake.",PloS one,"['D000818', 'D001042', 'D019476', 'D018517', 'D020543', 'D012469', 'D012471', 'D027843']","['Animals', 'Aphids', 'Insect Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Proteome', 'Salivary Glands', 'Salivary Proteins and Peptides', 'Vitis']",The salivary gland proteome of root-galling grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch) feeding on Vitis spp.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000469', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000469']","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'parasitology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'parasitology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31846459,2020

Herein, three HP-β-CD/GSE inclusion complexes with host-guest ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2 were successfully prepared by co-precipitation method to improve stability. Successful embedding of GSE in the HP-β-CD cavity was confirmed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. The Autodock Tools 1.5.6 was used to simulate the three-dimensional supramolecular structure of the inclusion complex of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and grape seed extract (HP-β-CD/GSE) by molecular docking. The MALDI-TOF-MS technology and chemical database Pubchem, and structural database PDB were combined to reconstitute the three-dimensional structure of target protein. The binding mode of the HP-β-CD/GSE inclusion complex to target protein was studied at the molecular level, and the antioxidant ability of the resulting HP-β-CD/GSE inclusion complexes was investigated by measuring 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging. The effects of HP-β-CD/GSE on myofibrillar protein from lamb tripe were also investigated under oxidative conditions. The positions and interactions of the binding sites of HP-β-CD/GSE inclusion complexes and target protein receptors were simulated by molecular docking. The results showed that HP-β-CD/GSE inclusion complexes were successfully prepared, optimally at a molar ratio of 1:2. At low (5 μmol/g) to medium (105 μmol/g) concentrations, HP-β-CD/GSE inclusion complexes decreased the carbonyl content, hydrophobicity, and protein aggregation of myofibrillar protein from lamb tripe, and increased the sulphydryl content.

31808345,"Thompson Seedless, a commonly grown table grape variety, is sensitive to salinity when grown on its own roots, and therefore, it is frequently grafted onto salinity-tolerant wild grapevine rootstocks. Rising soil salinity is a growing concern in irrigated agricultural systems. The accumulation of salts near the root zone severely hampers plant growth, leading to a decrease in the productive lifespan of grapevine and causing heavy yield losses to the farmer. In the present study, we investigated the differences in response to salinity between own-rooted Thompson Seedless (TSOR) and 110R-grafted Thompson Seedless (TS110R) grapevines, wherein 110R is reported to be a salt-tolerant rootstock. The grapevines were subjected to salt stress by treating them with a 150 mM NaCl solution. The stress-induced changes in protein abundance were investigated using a label-free shotgun proteomics approach at three time-points viz. 6 h, 48 h, and 7 days of salt treatment. A total of 2793 proteins were identified, of which 246 were differentially abundant at various time-points in TSOR and TS110R vines. The abundance of proteins involved in several biological processes such as photosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, translation, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and generation of precursor metabolites was significantly affected by salt stress in both the vines but at different stages of stress. The results revealed that TSOR vines responded fervently to salt stress, while TS110R vines adopted a preventive approach.

31755018,"There are contrasting hypotheses regarding the role of plant volatiles in host plant location. We used the grape berry moth (GBM; Paralobesia viteana)-grape plant (Vitis spp.) complex as a model for studying the proximate mechanisms of long distance olfactory-mediated, host-plant location and selection by a specialist phytophagous insect. We used flight tunnel assays to observe GBM female in-flight responses to host (V. riparia) and non-host (apple, Malus domestica; and gray dogwood, Cornus racimosa,) odor sources in the form of plant shoots, extracts of shoots, and synthetic blends. Gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses were used to identify antennal-active volatile compounds. All antennal-active compounds found in grape shoots were also present in dogwood and apple shoots. Female GBM flew upwind to host and non-host extracts and synthetic blends at similar levels, suggesting discrimination is not occurring at long distance from the plant. Further, females did not land on sources releasing plant extracts and synthetic blends, suggesting not all landing cues were present. Additionally, mated and unmated moths displayed similar levels of upwind flight responses to all odor sources, supporting the idea that plant volatiles are not functioning solely as ovipositional cues.

31732072,"Some red-pink table grape varieties, cultivated in warm climates, can fail in achieving the right level of anthocyanins responsible for the intense and uniform red color of berries. Nowadays, this is becoming an important technological issue in the Mediterranean area, which may result in decreasing market acceptance and potential economic value of table grape. Usually, plant growth regulators or phytohormones, such as S-ABA, can overcome this problem because they drive the accumulation of anthocyanins over the ripening season. Harpin proteins (HrP), which enhance the plant disease resistance, may be supposed to stimulate the anthocyanins biosynthesis in grape skin if applied close to veraison. Therefore, this research aimed at comparing the effect of HrP and S-ABA over the anthocyanin and color improvement of Crimson Seedless table grape grown in Southern Italy. For the first time, the exogenous treatment with HrP showed as effective as the less sustainable S-ABA one in favoring the anthocyanin accumulation, leading to peonidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and malvidin-3-O-glucoside values up to 4 folds higher than control grapes and giving rise to a greater concentration of the more stable acylated anthocyanins.

For this reason, a modified QuEChERS combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS) method was investigated. The optimization of UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS separation and QuEChERS procedure was performed. Under optimum conditions, the excellent chromatographic performance of the whole separation was accomplished within 6.3 min analyzing time. Meanwhile, the recoveries ranged from 77.2% to 101.7%, while relative standard deviation (RSD) remained between 0.0% and 9.4%. The limit of detection (LOD, 0.50-1.00 µg/L) and the limit of quantification (LOQ, 1.65-3.30 µg/L) were lower than those permitted by legislation in food matrices, which demonstrated the high sensitivity and applicability of this efficient method. This validated method was also applied in a pilot study to analyze BAs in 81 wine samples from Hexi Corridor Region (Gansu Province, Northwest China), CAD, HEX, HIS, PEA, PUT, and TYR were detected to varying degrees in the samples. However, when compared with the existing standards, the BAs in all 81 wine samples did not exceed the prescribed limit value or toxic dose (2-40 mg/L). Moreover, a statistical approach was also conducted using Pearson correlation analysis, and to evaluate their concentrations in terms of wine parameters (storage time, grape variety, wine type, and basic physicochemical index). The results showed that, among the seven kinds of BAs, the concentration of HIS had a certain correlation with alcoholic degree and grape variety. In addition, the level of PEA had a certain correlation with the wine pH and wine storage time. It is worth noting that this seems to be the first report regarding the application of QuEChERS-UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the analysis of BAs in wine in this region.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Development and Application of a New QuEChERS Method in UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS to Detect Seven Biogenic Amines in Chinese Wines.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694278,2020

The rich collection of Mediterranean imports recovered from the settlement, the elite burials in its surroundings and the Mediterranean-inspired mudbrick fortification wall further point to the importance of intercultural connections with the Mediterranean as a crucial factor in the transformation of Early Iron Age societies. We describe a new facet of this process by studying the transformation of consumption practices, especially drinking habits, brought about by intercultural encounters from the late 7th to the 5th century BC through the analysis of organic remains in 133 ceramic vessels found at the Heuneburg using Organic Residue Analysis (ORA). During the Ha D1 phase, fermented beverages, including Mediterranean grape wine, were identified in and appear to have been consumed from local handmade ceramics. The latter were recovered from different status-related contexts within the Heuneburg, suggesting an early and well-established trade/exchange system of this Mediterranean product. This contrasts with the results obtained for the drinking and serving vessels from the Ha D3 phase that were studied. The consumption of fermented beverages (wine and especially bacteriofermented products) appears to have been concentrated on the plateau. The ORA analyses presented here seem to indicate that during this time, grape wine was consumed primarily from imported vessels, and more rarely from local prestigious fine wheel-made vessels. In addition to imported wine, we demonstrate the consumption of a wide variety of foodstuffs, such as animal fats (especially dairy products), millet, plant oils and waxy plants, fruit and beehive products as well as one or several other fermented beverage(s) that were probably locally produced.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS was employed to evaluate the cleavage specificity and usefulness of the isolated cysteine protease in protein and peptide research. A potential applicability could be anticipated from the efficient digestion performance in volatile ammonium formate buffers at pH 3. Common peptides were digested and the resulting products analyzed by MS/MS sequencing. Then, mixtures of protein standards and extracted barley nuclear proteins were processed in the same way. Grape cysteine protease is nonspecific but shows a certain preference for Arg, Lys, and also Leu residues.

Despite the significant role of these compounds in grape berries, knowledge of grape lipid composition is still limited. This study addresses the free fatty acid composition and other lipids in skins and seeds of several Vitis vinifera grape cultivars using LC-MS/MS. A different profile of free fatty acids was determined in the grape tissues, showing a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in seeds (ca. 60%). Lignoceric acid was one of the main free saturated fatty acids found in grape skins, together with palmitic and stearic acids. Berry skins showed similar ranges of C18-unsaturated fatty acids, whereas linoleic acid was predominant in the seed fatty acid composition. Higher content of glycerophospholipids was determined in grape seeds. Uvaol and oleanolic acid were only quantified in skins (1.5-3.9 and 38.6-57.6 mg/kg fresh weight, respectively).

31531782,"In grape (Vitis), stilbene phytoalexins can either be in situ synthesized or transported to the site of response during powdery mildew infection, enhancing disease resistance. Resveratrol is a phytoprotective stilbenoid compound that is synthesized by stilbene synthase (STS) in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and is also known to have health benefits in the human diet. We have previously shown that transgenic Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless plants overexpressing a stilbene synthase gene, VqSTS6, from wild Chinese Vitis quinquangularis had a higher stilbenoid content, leading to an enhanced resistance to powdery mildew (Uncinula necator (Schw.) Burr). However, the biosynthesis and transportation in the plant tissue under powdery mildew infection are still unclear. Here, inhibitor and micro-grafting technologies were used to study the accumulation of resveratrol following powdery mildew infection. We observed that the levels of STS expression and stilbenoids increased in response to powdery mildew infection. Powdery mildew and inhibitor treatment on detached grape branches showed that resveratrol was in situ synthesized. Experiments with grafted plantlets showed that the abundance of stilbenoid compounds increased in the shoot during VqSTS6 overexpression in the root, while VqSTS6-Flag fusion was not tranported to the scions and only expressed in the transgenic rootstocks. Compared with wild-type Thompson Seedless plants, the non-transgenic/VqSTS6 transgenic (scion/rootstock) grafted Thompson Seedless plantlets exhibited increased resistance to powdery mildew. In addition, overexpression of VqSTS6 in roots led to increased levels of stilbenoid compounds in five other European grape varieties (V. vinifera cvs. Chardonnay, Perlette, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling and Muscat Hamburg).

Several factors that affects host's physiology can modulate the bioavailability of grape polyphenols and, in turn, their effects. Mammals undergo physiological and metabolic changes due to the different day length (photoperiod) within a year. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate if the bioavailability of phenolic compounds from the same red grapes with a different polyphenol profile (i.e. red grape produced organically (OG) or non-organically (conventional, CG)) differs with the photoperiod exposure. For this, the serum phenolic metabolites of Fischer 344 rats keep at different photoperiods (18, 12 or 6 h of light per day) and administered with OG or CG for 10-week were profiled by HPLC-MS/MS. Our results indicated that rats administered with OG reported a higher total serum metabolite concentration independent of the photoperiod exposure and CG-administered rats showed a more varied serum metabolite profile depending of the photoperiod exposure. Those rats exposed to 6 h of light per day, which emulates winter light conditions, presented a higher bioavailability of grape phenolics.

The OAVs of most aroma compounds varied greatly between a rice and a wheat bread. In particular, 2-aminoacetophenone with a grape-like, medicinal aroma was characteristic for rice bread crumb and crust, while maltol was only relevant in wheat bread crust. Ehrlich pathway products varied in their concentration between the bread crumbs and were correlated with the contents of their corresponding free amino acid precursors in the flours and doughs. The analysis of rice flour revealed that only a few aroma compounds were retained in the bread. Consequently, the bread making process has a high relevance in aroma compound formation.

31446037,"The wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae forms an integral part of wine production by converting relatively 'neutral' flavoured grape must into varietal aromatic wines. Additionally, non-Saccharomyces strains can be used with S. cerevisiae for the production of wines with more complexity. Yeast strains, to varying extents, produce and/or mediate the release of a whole range of key metabolites, which in turn contribute to enhanced aroma and flavour of the final wine, especially Sauvignon blanc. These metabolites viz. thiols are dependent on yeast-expressed enzymes during fermentation. Inoculation with an appropriate yeast will, therefore, lead to more commercial wine sales due to resultant wines with sought-after aroma and flavour. Likewise, inoculation with the incorrect yeast will have a negative effect on sales. It is also important to have quality control measures in place to ensure that the inoculated yeast strain quickly dominate, and is present throughout the fermentation process. Traditionally, the laborious contour clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) DNA karyotyping technique was shown to be reliable in this regard, however cutting-edge matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) biotyping is proving to be a faster alternative. As both methods have advantages and disadvantages, they should be used in complementary as opposed to competitively. Standard chemical and descriptive sensory analyses of wine also serve as evaluation and/or characterisation tools of yeast starter cultures. Additionally, metabolomic and proteomic profiling using gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of final wines was shown to be instrumental yeast evaluation tools.

A total of 121 components were tentatively identified, consisting of 48 ellagic acids and precursors (EP), 38 flavonols, 20 hydroxybenzoic acids, 6 hydroxycinnamic acids, 5 flavan-3-ols, and 4 stilbenes. EP (mostly ellagic acid derivatives) and flavonols (mainly isorhamnetin and quercetin derivatives) were, respectively, accumulated abundantly in the muscadine and European grape skins. Additionally, their variation had considerable differences during berry maturation. EP in muscadine cv. ""Noble"" skins showed a small decrease before veraison and a slight increase post-veraison, yet the flavonols significantly increased as berry maturation in European skins, with a few exceptions. This is the interactional result between genotype and environmental factors, which obviously influences the polyphenol composition and concentration. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Muscadine grapes, indigenous to the southeast of United States, have been introduced to South China in recent years. These grapes have unique polyphenol composition that differs from non-muscadine grapes. Their polyphenol properties have been studied extensively in many but there are a few studies in our knowledge about the variation of these compounds at different berry developmental stages. This article evaluates the accumulation of non-anthocyanin polyphenols in muscadine skins during berry maturation, in comparison to European grapes.

31313316,"Bioactive anthocyanins from aqueous extracts of muscadine grape pomace were concentrated using osmotic distillation (OD) and direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) using polypropylene (PP) and poly(ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene) (ECTFE) membranes. The driving force for OD is created by using a high concentration brine solution while the driving force for DCMD is generated by elevating the feed temperature relative to the permeate temperature. The brine concentration used was 4 M. The lowest fluxes were obtained for OD. Given the temperature sensitive nature of anthocyanins, the maximum temperature difference during DCMD was limited to 30 °C. The feed temperature was 40 °C and the permeate at 10 °C. Consequently, the maximum flux during DCMD was also limited. A combination of OD and DCMD was found to give the highest fluxes. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and HPLC-electrospray mass spectrometry were used to identify and quantify anthocyanins, cyanidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, delphinidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, petunidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, peonidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, and malvidin-3,5-O-diglucoside. The results obtained here suggest that, though water fluxes for DI water feed streams for PP and ECTFE membrane were similar, the fluxes obtained for the two membranes when using muscadine pomace extracts were different. Concentration factors of close to 3 was obtained for anthocyanins. Membranes also showed slightly different performance in the concentration process. Membrane surfaces were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. The results suggest that adsorption of these anthocyanins on the membrane surface lead to performance differences. In an actual operation, selection of an appropriate membrane and regeneration of the membrane will be important for optimized performance. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Anthocyanins are valuable therapeutic compounds, which are found in the solid residue left following fruit juice pressing. However, recovery and concentration of these therapeutic compounds remains challenging due to their stability. Here, a novel membrane-based unit operation has been investigated in order to concentrate the anthocyanins that have been extracted into aqueous solutions.

Wistar rats received diets supplemented with either GPP (8%), extractable polyphenols (EP), non-extractable polyphenols-rich fraction (NEP-F), or polyphenols-poor, fiber-rich fraction (F) from grapes at amounts equivalent to the GPP group during 15 days before and for 7 days after colitis induction.

Relative concentrations of twenty-six monoterpenyl glycosides, including nine new putatively identified compounds, were analyzed by UHPLC-QTOF MS/MS at three times during grape maturation (pre-véraison, véraison, and post-véraison). Total glycoside content reached a maximum in Muscat cultivars post-véraison but remained relatively constant in all other cultivars. Three types of monoterpenyl glycosides predominated in all samples: malonylated monoterpenol glucosides, monoterpenol hexose-pentoses, and monoterpendiol hexose-pentoses. The two Muscat cultivars were not differentiated at the earlier developmental stages but could be differentiated post-véraison. In contrast, similarities between Chardonnay and Pinot noir glycoside profiles developed post-véraison.

Phenolic compounds were evaluated by HPLC-MS/MS. The AC was measured by in vitro (FRAP, ABTS and DPPH) and cellular (Caco-2 cells) assays. Digestion had a reducing effect on phenolic content, being only 31% and 67% of native polyphenols from grapes and wines, respectively, potentially bioaccessible. At same polyphenol concentration, cellular AC of nondigested and digested foods was the same, indicating that changes in phenolic profile did not modify the bioactivity. Phenolic acids, in addition to quercetin, were the most resistant polyphenols to digestion, and would be the most relevant to explain the biological activity of digested foods.

The aim of this study was to determine whether feeding GPM to lactating dairy cows would alter the milk proteome through changes in nitrogen (N) partitioning. Ten lactating Holstein cows were fed a total mixed ration (TMR) top-dressed with either 1.5 kg dry matter (DM)/cow/day GPM (GPM group; n = 5) or 2.0 kg DM/cow/day of a 50:50 beet pulp: soy hulls mix (control group; n = 5). Characterization of N partitioning and calculation of N partitioning was completed through analysis of plasma urea-N, urine, feces, and milk urea-N. Milk samples were collected for general composition analysis, HPLC quantification of the high abundance milk proteins (including casein isoforms, α-lactalbumin, and β-lactoglobulin) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the low abundance protein enriched milk fraction. No differences in DMI, N parameters, or calculated N partitioning were observed across treatments. Dietary treatment did not affect milk yield, milk protein or fat content or yield, or the concentrations of high abundance milk proteins quantified by HPLC analysis. Of the 127 milk proteins that were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis, 16 were affected by treatment, including plasma proteins and proteins associated with the blood-milk barrier, suggesting changes in mammary passage. Immunomodulatory proteins, including butyrophilin subfamily 1 member 1A and serum amyloid A protein, were higher in milk from GPM-fed cows. Heightened abundance of bioactive proteins in milk caused by dietary-induced shifts in mammary passage could be a feasible method to enhance the healthfulness of milk for both the milk-fed calf and human consumer.

The Vitis vinifera cultivar Cannonau is used to produce the renowned Italian controlled designation of origin (DOC) wine ""Cannonau"" from Sardinia. Two Cannonau vineyards located in Sardinia Region were studied to establish the relationship between geochemical features of vineyard soil and chemical composition of leaves and grape berries. Major and trace elements were determined by X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in soil, leaf, and grape berry samples. The index of bioaccumulation and the translocation coefficients were also calculated for all elements. Data from the two study areas were compared by a non-parametric test and multivariate statistics (principal component analysis). The results showed a specific assimilation of these elements in leaf and grape berry from vine in two different soils. Moreover, geochemical characterization and statistical analysis enabled to discriminate the cultivar ""Cannonau"" according to geographical origin. The results showed that the elements that could establish a reliable correlation between the soil vineyard and leaves and grape berries from the two study areas were B, Sr, and Zr.

In some cases, the mechanisms that are involved in these reactions are not thoroughly understood and can lead to unexpected problems and delayed haze formation after CMC addition to red wines. Small-scale bench trials were conducted in model systems under different pH conditions to monitor the formation of turbidity and protection mechanisms during the interaction of proteins, polyphenols, and polysaccharides. Egg-white protein was chosen as a protein model due to its complex composition, a commercial grape tannin extract was used as polyphenol source, and pectin, glucomannan, mannoprotein, alginate, and CMC were applied as polysaccharides to model various wine conditions. Reactions were monitored in duplicate on a 50 mL scale by spectrophotometry at 860 nm over at least 30 days.

Progress curves for each condition were constructed by monitoring the decrease in concentration of PA solutions after exposure to CWM over 720 min. Adsorption isotherms were constructed for each condition, and a Langmuir equation model was applied to each via regression analysis. Compositional changes in the PA solutions after exposure to CWM were determined using phloroglucinolysis and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). A negative correlation between PA adsorption and both the temperature and ethanol concentration was found. Progress curves suggested that both the temperature and ethanol affect the equilibration rate of the adsorption reactions. Additionally, equilibration rates for lower temperature and ethanol concentration conditions were found to be much longer than previously reported, taking up to 720 min. Phloroglucinolysis results showed no discernible correlation between the temperature or ethanol concentration and percent galloylation or percent gallo units of adsorbed compounds. Analyses by phloroglucinolysis and GPC indicate a preferential adsorption of larger molecular weight PAs under all conditions, although no discernible impact on PA composition was detected.

The investigation of the nutritional values of these by-products is essential towards sustainable agriculture and improved food systems. In the vine industry, grape leaves are a bulky side product which is strategically removed and treated as waste in the process of wine production. In this work we performed an untargeted metabolomic profiling of the methanol extract of the leaves of Vitis vinifera cultivar 'Pinot noir', analysed their fatty acid content, and estimated their antioxidative capacity, with the purpose of investigating its nutritional and medicinal value. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) analysis identified the presence of numerous compounds which are known to possess diverse nutritional and pharmacological properties, particularly polyphenols and phenolic compounds (e.g. caffeic acid, catechin, kaempferol and quercetin), several phytosterols and fatty acids. Fatty acids were the most represented lipids' secondary class, with the essential alpha-linolenic acid being the most abundant in 'Pinot noir' leaves, with a relative content of 42%. Also, we have found that 'Pinot noir' leaves present a high antioxidant capacity, putting grapevine leaves at the top of the list of foods with the highest antioxidative activity.

The present study was aimed at the growth of callus and production of polyphenolic compound of callus derived from a Maltese indigenous grapevine variety, Ġellewża. Callus was inoculated onto plant growth regulators-enriched Murashige Skoog media (MSm) to determine whether polyphenols are produced in vitro as well as to determine the best combination of plant growth regulators needed for the production of these metabolites. From results obtained, it was observed that the best callus production was obtained by auxin-enriched MSm. In fact, indole acetic acid and indole acetic acid /6-benzyl aminopurine enhanced biomass accumulation (3.04 g and 3.39 g) as opposed to the others (<1.97 g). On the other hand, parameters showing the presence of flavonoids (tonality, 3.80), particularly anthocyanins (24.09 mg/kg) and total polyphenols (1.42 mg/g), were optimum in the presence of cytokinins, particularly 6-benzyl aminopurine. Analysis for single polyphenols revealed a high amount a particular stilbene: polydatin (glucoside of resveratrol). Resveratrol and other typical polyphenols, found in mature berries, were also found in significant quantities, while the other polyphenolic compounds were found in minimal quantities. This is the first study to describe the production and composition of polyphenols in Ġellewża callus cultures.

31108815,"Fatty acids play important roles in the maintenance of cell membrane, viability and overall metabolism of wine yeasts (particularly Saccharomyces cerevisiae) during adverse winemaking conditions. We previously showed that linoleic acid supplementation markedly affect aroma compound production of S. cerevisiae wine strains. However, very little is known about how other commonly found fatty acids in grape juice modulate the growth and metabolism of S. cerevisiae. We aimed to determine the individual effect of five fatty acids on fermentation patterns and metabolism of two wine yeast strains (S. cerevisiae EC1118 and X5). Microvinification was performed at 15 °C by supplementing a grape juice (individually) with three different concentrations of saturated (palmitic acid), unsaturated (oleic, linoleic and γ-linolenic acids) and short-chain (hexanoic acid) fatty acids. Metabolite profiles of the resulting wines were determined using Gas-chromatography coupled to Mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). Our data show that the addition of γ-linolenic acid to the juice caused the production of higher amounts of amino and organic acids (except isoleucine and 2-oxoglutaric acid) in wines when fermented by EC1118, while palmitic acid supplementation showed similar trends when fermented by X5. The effect of linoleic acid was independent of yeast strains and we observed a global reduction of amino and organic acids (except pyruvic acid) while increased production of most of the fatty acids other than the supplemented ones. Our data clearly suggest that pre-fermentative supplementation of different fatty acids indeed influenced the growth and metabolism of wine yeasts in a different way. Thus, attention needs to be paid not only to the wine yeast strain used during the winemaking but also to the overall grape juice composition, including fatty acids, to obtain the desired wine characteristics.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D005227', 'D005285', 'D005504', 'D005511', 'D005561', 'D000067030', 'D008401', 'D019787', 'D009812', 'D012441', 'D027843', 'D055549', 'D014920']","['Fatty Acids', 'Fermentation', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Formates', 'Fruit and Vegetable Juices', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Odorants', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Vitis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Wine']",Pre-fermentative supplementation of fatty acids alters the metabolic activity of wine yeasts.,"['Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['metabolism', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108815,2020

In this work, the quality (enological parameters, color, phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and fungicide residues) of wines from Monastrell grapes fortified with iprovalicarb, mepanipyrim, and tetraconazole fungicides was evaluated. Along the winemaking process, initial residues of mepanipyrim and tetraconazole were removed in more than 90% while the dissipation of iprovalicarb was around 73%. Significant statistical differences were found in the presence of iprovalicarb and mepanipyrim residues, especially at the highest concentration assayed. For both fungicides, increases in the volatile acidity (between 4 and 8.6 times), the lactic acid content (between 8.6 and 20.5 times), the percentage of polymeric anthocyanins (between 1.3 and 1.7 times), and also a slight increase of the total phenolic index and the total anthocyanin content determined by spectrophotometry were observed. On the contrary, the total monomeric anthocyanins content decreased about 16.3% and 28.6% in the presence of iprovalicarb and mepanipyrim, respectively. These results could be related to a higher development of acetic acid or lactic bacteria in the presence of these fungicides. The color of the final wines was also different in comparison with the control, with a higher yellow component, color intensity, tonality, and hue angle because of pH changes in the medium. Tetraconazole fermentations had a more similar trend to the control wine, probably due to the lower concentration of this fungicide in the grape must at the initial time. No effects on the antioxidant activity was observed for any of the target fungicides.

Here we focus on determining the effects of the second fermentation and aging on lees of sparkling wine from País grape variety combining different analysis techniques for the first time in sparkling wine: gas chromatography/mass spectrometry/olfactometry and sensorial analysis. During the second fermentation and aging, there was a significant loss of esters that might be related to the adsorption on lees and ester volatility and chemical hydrolysis. The concentration of several compounds such as some esters (diethyl succinate, ethyl lactate, and ethyl isovalerate) increased during aging and could be used as aging markers. Vitispiranes were identified as the best norisoprenoids aging markers for young sparkling wines (12 months of aging). Also, PCA showed that time of aging on lees affected mostly esters and terpenes. On the other hand, the diminution of fruity/floral impact odorants during aging was not perceived in sensorial trials.

In this study, two methods were developed to characterize sixteen varieties of table and wine grapes: (1) a LC-MS method to identify major and minor phenolic compounds; and (2) a HPLC-DAD method to quantify the most representative compounds. Sixty-seven molecules belonging to different classes of phenolic compounds were identified: anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, stilbenes and organic acids. In parallel, the free radical scavenging activity and anti-inflammatory activities of the 16 grape varieties were evaluated. The results showed a good correlation between the total phenolic content and the biological activity. Extracts from Exalta and Albarossa grape varieties were the most active in reducing IL-8 release by gastric epithelial cells (IC50 = 8.48 μg mL-1 and 6.68 μg mL-1, respectively), a biomarker of inflammatory processes.

Results showed that anthocyanin biosynthesis was strongly repressed during the rainy season. Environmental fluctuation from seasonal rain provoked metabolic responses in grapes, and there was a significantly greater accumulation of most of the anthocyanins, mainly the compositions of non-acylated and non-methylated, under rain-shelter cultivation; these findings indicate that rain-shelter cultivation may help improve tolerance to seasonal rain-induced stresses.

Therefore, the production of raisins of BRS Morena grapes pre-treated with olive oil as a natural surfactant constitutes an interesting process from both the industrial and health points of view, because of the remarkable reduction in the processing time and the preservation of high concentrations of flavonoids, which have important claims to health benefits from biological activities.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000872', 'D002851', 'D003890', 'D005419', 'D044948', 'D005638', 'D010636', 'D010936', 'D044945', 'D013267', 'D027843']","['Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Desiccation', 'Flavonoids', 'Flavonols', 'Fruit', 'Phenols', 'Plant Extracts', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Stilbenes', 'Vitis']",Effect of the pre-treatment and the drying process on the phenolic composition of raisins produced with a seedless Brazilian grape cultivar.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30716936,2020
30697978,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic compound broadly used in medical devices as well as in packaging of food and drinks. Recently, BPA toxicity has become of concern to environmental public health. Red wine that is susceptible to BPA contamination is an alcoholic beverage made from yeast fermentation of grapes in the presence of grape skins so as to extract phenolic compounds. The aim of this study was to validate an efficient, low cost, and time-saving method for BPA determination in red-wine beverage. To this end, a rapid and simple microextraction method is here proposed consisting in liquid-liquid separation assisted by a vortex-ultrasound-vortex procedure combined with gas chromatographic analysis (GC-Fid or GC-IT/MS). By means of a comparative study between real red-wine matrix and synthetic hydroalcoholic solutions, different parameters related to the microextraction steps were investigated. The minimal amount of extraction solvent for a given volume of sample was calculated for both the systems. It was demonstrated that for red-wine matrix, the extent of phase separation is strongly affected by some wine constituents and that separation can be tuned by varying the amount of the extraction solvent.

Twenty wine samples (Pfalz region, Germany) were diluted with methanol and used for quantitative analysis without any further sample preparation. The developed amino acid method provided quantitative and characteristic fingerprints of wine varieties. The amino acid assignments were verified by HPTLC-MS. The developed gluconic acid method was primarily used to control the threshold, indicating a Botrytis cinerea infection of grapes. However, this method also enabled the detection of further organic acids like malic, tartaric and citric acids. A glycerol method was developed for control of the grape must fermentation (spontaneous/regular) and for fraud detection (glycerol adulteration). The HPTLC results of the sugar contents in the wine samples were similar to those of the well-known Luff-Schoorl method. The combined use of these developed HPTLC methods allowed the fermentation control (e.g., alcoholic and malolactic fermentation) and the monitoring of the grapes' overall health status.

30515692,A simple and fast method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed for cymoxanil residue analysis in grape. Sample preparation based on solid-liquid extraction was optimized without using adsorbent for purification. Recoveries were 79.8-109.5% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 2.5-9.4% at fortified levels from 0.001 to 0.50 mg/kg. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.3 μg/kg. Field trials were conducted to explore the dissipation and terminal residue behavior of cymoxanil in grape. Results showed that the half-lives of cymoxanil were from 0.5 to 0.7 days.

30497604,"Protein precipitation, also referred to as protein instability, may lead to haziness in bottled wines and result in significant commercial losses. To avoid problems of this nature, fining finished wines with clay (bentonite) is the most commonly applied methodology. However, bentonite fining reduces yield and may affect wine quality. Protein haze has been primarily linked to grape pathogenesis-related proteins, in particular chitinases and thaumatin-like proteins. To better understand the persistence of these proteins during fermentation, reverse phase chromatography was used to monitor the evolution of total grape proteins as well as of chitinases and thaumatin-like proteins during alcoholic fermentation. The data confirm a previously reported significant decrease in total protein content during fermentation. This reduction in total protein levels was observed throughout fermentation, and was affected by factors such as fermentation temperature, yeast strain or grape cultivar. However, significant changes in the concentration of free chitinases were observed in a yeast strain-dependent manner. The data thus confirm the correlation between the levels of yeast cell wall chitin and changes in chitinase concentration, and suggest that it is primarily the amount of lateral chitin, and not the chitin in bud scars, that is responsible for this activity.",Food microbiology,"['D002473', 'D002686', 'D002688', 'D005285', 'D010940', 'D012441', 'D013696', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Cell Wall', 'Chitin', 'Chitinases', 'Fermentation', 'Plant Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Temperature', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Chitinases and thaumatin-like proteins in Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay musts during alcoholic fermentation.,"['Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'cytology', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30497604,2019
30473422,"Anthocyanins contents and compositions play an important role in grape berries and wines. Grapevines are widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid areas, and water shortage restricts the development of wine industry. The aim of this work was to gain insight on the effect of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) on the accumulation and biosynthesis of anthocyanins in Cabernet Sauvignon (Vitis Vinifera L.) grapes and wines. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for anthocyanins profiles analyses and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used for the genes expressions measurement. The grapevines were treated with 60% (RDI-1), 70% (RDI-2), 80% (RDI-3), 100% (CK, traditional drip irrigation) of their estimated evapotranspiration (ETc) respectively. RDI treatments significantly reduced titration acid and increased pH with higher total soluble solids. RDI-1 treatment increased total anthocyanins contents in berries and wines in both two vintages. RDI-1 and RDI-2 treatments significantly increased the contents of acylated anthocyanins in berries and wines, especially Malvidin-3-acetly-glucoside. RDI treatments significantly increased non-acylated anthocyanins contents in wines, such as Delphinidin-3-gliucoside and Malvidin-3-glucoside. RDI treatments upregulated the expressions of VvPAL, VvC4H, VvCHS, VvF3'H, VvF3'5'H, VvLDOX, and VvOMT in both two vintages. Correlation analysis showed the accumulation of anthocyanins was closely related to the key genes expressions, including VvPAL, VvF3'H, VvF3'5'H etc. The present results provided direct evidence and detailed data to explain that RDI treatments regulated the accumulation of anthocyanins by regulating genes expressions in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway.",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,"['D057914', 'D000872', 'D002851', 'D003681', 'D005638', 'D018506', 'D017343', 'D060888', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Agricultural Irrigation', 'Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dehydration', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Anthocyanin accumulation and biosynthesis are modulated by regulated deficit irrigation in Cabernet Sauvignon (Vitis Vinifera L.) grapes and wines.,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032']","['methods', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30473422,2019
30459417,"Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments found in the cell vacuoles of fruits and flowers, performing several roles from insects attraction to stress protection. Their antioxidant activity contributes to human health, and consuming plant-derived products provides their higher source in the diet. Although their colour and nutritional features, their contribution to sensory properties of foods has not been widely investigated. In wine, preferences are connected with sensory attributes of colour, aroma, taste, and mouthfeel. In this study, grape anthocyanin extracts (TAE) were fractionated using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) and preparative HPLC in three fractions, i.e glucoside (GF), acetylated (AF) and cinnamoylated (CF) anthocyanins. Sensory properties were investigated by chemical analysis, as reactivity towards bovin serum albumin (BSA) and salivary proteins, and in tasting sessions to assess anthocyanins best estimated thresholds (BET) in wine-like solution. Anthocyanins reacted with both BSA and salivary proteins, but to different extents, because higher interaction between salivary proteins and anthocyanins were found. Cinnamoylated anthocyanins are the most reactive to salivary proteins.

Nevertheless, expert mass spectrometry users and chemists are still needed to select the correct entry from the numerous candidates proposed by automatic tools, especially in the plant kingdom due to the huge structural diversity of natural compounds occurring in plants. In this work, we propose the use of a supervised machine learning approach to predict molecular substructures from isotopic patterns, training the model on a large database of grape metabolites. This approach, called 'Compounds Characteristics Comparison' (CCC) emulates the experience of a plant chemist who 'gains experience' from a (proof-of-principle) dataset of grape compounds. The results show that the CCC approach is able to predict with good accuracy most of the sub-structures proposed. In addition, after querying MS/MS spectra in Metfrag 2.2 and applying CCC predictions as scoring terms with real data, the CCC approach helped to give a better ranking to the correct candidates, improving users' confidence in candidate selection. Our results demonstrated that the proposed approach can complement current identification strategies based on fragmentation simulators and formula calculators, assisting compound identification. The CCC algorithm is freely available as R package (https://github.com/lucanard/CCC) which includes a seamless integration with Metfrag. The CCC package also permits uploading additional training data, which can be used to extend the proposed approach to other systems biological matrices.

Following on from the empirical observations of winegrowers, we assessed the contribution of grape seeds to wine sensory properties. An inductive fractionation method guided by gustatometry was used to isolate and characterize sweet-tasting compounds from grapes. Fractionation of grape seed macerates was achieved by liquid-liquid extraction, centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) and preparative HPLC. Then, the structures of the purified compounds were elucidated by use of FTMS and NMR. Five compounds were identified: two new compounds, 2-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic-2-O-β-glucopyranoside (H3MP-G) and 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic-2-O-β-glucopyranoside acids (H4MP-G), along with gallic-4-O-β-glucopyranoside acid (AG-G), 3-indolyl-(2R)-O-β-d-glycoside lactic acid (ILA-G) and epi-DPA-3'-O-β-glucopyranoside acid (epi-DPA-G).

30308002,"High-fat diet (HFD)-induced leaky gut syndrome combined with low-grade inflammation increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intestine and may contribute to dysbiosis and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Poorly bioavailable and only partially metabolizable dietary polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins (PACs), may exert their beneficial effects on metabolic health by scavenging intestinal ROS. To test this hypothesis, we developed and validated a novel, noninvasive, in situ method for visualizing intestinal ROS using orally administered ROS-sensitive indocyanine green (ICG) dye. C57BL/6J mice fed HFD for 10 weeks accumulated high levels of intestinal ROS compared to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD). Oral administration of poorly bioavailable grape polyphenol extract (GPE) and β-carotene decreased HFD-induced ROS in the gut to levels comparable to LFD-fed mice, while administration of more bioavailable dietary antioxidants (α-lipoic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E) did not. Forty percent of administered GPE antioxidant activity was measured in feces collected over 24 h, confirming poor bioavailability and persistence in the gut. The bloom of beneficial anaerobic gut bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, associated with improved metabolic status in rodents and humans may be directly linked to protective antioxidant activity of some dietary components.

During three wine seasons, red and white grape wines were produced using various malolactic fermentation induction techniques: Coinoculation, sequential inoculation, and spontaneous process. Volatile compounds (diacetyl and the products of its metabolism, and selected ethyl fatty acid esters) were extracted by solid phase microextraction. Compounds were identified with a multidimensional gas chromatograph-GC × GC-ToFMS with ZOEX cryogenic (N₂) modulator. Sensory evaluation of the wines was also performed. It was found that the fermentation-derived metabolites studied were affected by the malolactic bacteria inoculation regime. Quantitatively, ethyl lactate, diethyl succinate, and ethyl acetate dominated as esters with the largest increase in content. The total concentration of ethyl esters was highest for the coinoculation technique, while the highest concentration of diacetyl was noted for the spontaneous technique.

Some strains are able to convert the parent mycotoxin into other compounds by means of hydrolysis and/or conjugation reactions through their defense mechanisms and enzymatic activity, leading to the formation of a modified mycotoxin. Thus, the variability of growth and metabolite production are inherent to the strain, occurring distinctively even when submitted to similar conditions. In this sense, this contribution aimed at determining the variability in multiplication and production of OTA by strains of A. carbonarius and A. niger isolated from grapes, as well as investigating the formation of modified mycotoxins. Strains were incubated in grape-based medium, and the diameter of the colonies measured daily. The determination of OTA was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography and the identification of modified mycotoxins was carried out using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Variabilities in terms of growth and OTA production were assessed across five different strains. Peak production of OTA was detected on day 15, and a decline on day 21 was observed, indicating that the observed reduction may be associated with the degradation or modification of the OTA over time by the fungus.

30150601,"Extraction of grape components is a key consideration for red winemaking. The impact of changing process variables on mass transfer properties of anthocyanins from fresh pre-fermentative red grape solids under forced convective conditions was explored using the dominant red grape anthocyanin, malvidin-3-glucoside (M3G) as a model solute. A two level full factorial design was implemented to investigate effects of temperature, sugar and ethanol on mass transfer properties. Factor levels were chosen to simulate conditions found at various points during the maceration and fermentation steps of the red winemaking process. A rigorous mathematical model was developed and applied to experimental extraction curves, allowing the separation of mass transport properties in liquid and solid phases in a wine-like system, for the first time. In all cases, the coefficient of determination exceeded 0.92, indicating good agreement between experimental and mathematically-solved M3G concentrations. For the conditions studied, internal mass transfer was found to limit M3G extraction and changes to the liquid phase composition and temperature influence the distribution constant. Surface response models of mass transfer parameters were developed to allow future simulations of fermentation scenarios aimed at maximising the extraction potential of M3G.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000465', 'D000872', 'D002853', 'D005960', 'D008956', 'D015233', 'D064209', 'D010936', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Algorithms', 'Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Glucosides', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Statistical', 'Phytochemicals', 'Plant Extracts', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Modelling the Mass Transfer Process of Malvidin-3-Glucoside during Simulated Extraction from Fresh Grape Solids under Wine-Like Conditions.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150601,2018

The majority of bioavailable grape polyphenols, including the most abundant flavan-3-ols, i.e. (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, undergo extensive microbial metabolism in the gut, forming metabolites that can be highly bioavailable and bioactive. To gain a better understanding in microbial metabolism of grape polyphenols and to identify bioactive metabolites, advanced analytical methods are needed to accurately quantitate microbial-derived metabolites, particularly at trace levels, in addition to their precursors. This work describes the development and validation of a high-throughput, sensitive and reproducible GC-QqQ/MS method operated under MRM mode that allowed the identification and quantification of 16 phenolic acid metabolites, along with (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, in flavanol-enriched broth samples anaerobically fermented with human intestinal bacteria. Excellent sensitivity was achieved with low limits of detection and low limits of quantification in the range of 0.24-6.18 ng/mL and 0.480-12.37 ng/mL, respectively. With the exception of hippuric acid, recoveries of most analytes were greater than 85%. The percent accuracies for almost all analytes were within ±23% and precision results were all below 18%. Application of the developed method to in vitro samples fermented with different human gut microbiota revealed distinct variations in the extent of flavanol catabolism, as well as production of bioactive phenolic acid metabolites.

However, in markets, adulteration of berry fruit juice with cheaper substitutes is frequent. In the present study, a metabolomic approach for authentication of berry fruit juices by liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) was established. The global characterization of the berry fruit metabolome by information dependent acquisition directed LC-MS/MS coupled to a peak mining workflow by isotope pattern matching was reported. Targeted metabolomics analysis of known juice biomarkers, such as flavonoids, anthocyanins, etc. exhibited a good separation of berry fruit juices from adulterant juices. Moreover, untargeted metabolomics analysis was carried out and subjected to chemometrics analysis. Discrimination of blueberry juice, cranberry juice, and its adulterant apple juice and grape juice was obtained by principal component analysis-discriminant analysis.

29908267,"Twenty three strains of Penicillium expansum, as a predominant species, were isolated from 23 (92%) out of 25 grape samples of 17 different grape varieties. The results of the identification of P. expansum strains were confirmed by a PCR method. Most of the isolates of P. expansum (21/23, 91%), when tested for toxigenicity, were bi-toxigenic: they produced citrinin (CIT) and particularly high amounts of patulin (PAT). A validated UPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of PAT and CIT was applied. The limits of quantification (LOQ) for PAT and CIT in grape must and toxigenicity testing samples were 100 and 2 ng/g, respectively. The results of PAT and CIT quantification in 23 grape must samples demonstrated the occurrence of PAT in 10 (43%) grape must samples (mean: 171 ng/g; median: 50 ng/g; and range: 143-644 ng/g) and the occurrence of CIT in two (9%) grape must samples (mean: 1 ng/g; median: 1 ng/g; and range: 2.5-3.5 ng/g). This is the first report on the natural occurrence of CIT in grape must.

However, little is known about the main GPE metabolites in mammals, which could help explain the observed health-promoting effects. This study investigated the presence of parent compounds from flavanol, flavonol and stilbene families and their metabolites in rat plasma and tissues after an acute intake of GPE in doses of 300 and 600 mg kg/body weight. The measurement of free compounds and their metabolites was performed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Results showed the presence of epicatechin, epicatechin methyl-glucuronide, epicatechin methyl-sulphate, catechin, catechin-glucuronide, quercetin methyl-glucuronide, resveratrol-3-glucuronide, resveratrol-4-glucuronide and resveratrol-3-sulphate in plasma, which was dose dependent. The most abundant measured compound in plasma was epicatechin-glucuronide. The presence of glucuronidated and methyl-glucuronidated forms of catechin were observed in the liver at both doses, while epicatechin-glucuronide and methyl-glucuronide were detected only upon intake of 600 mg GPE/kg body weight. At this dose epicatechin-glucuronide and methyl-glucuronide were also detected in muscle, and catechin methyl-glucuronide in adipose tissue.

However, details of metabolic interactions between endophytes and host plants were less understood. In this work, we used high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the metabolites of fruit flesh cells of grape treated with dual culture of different endophytic fungal strains (EFS). We observed that the dual-culture with different fungal strains show different metabolites composition in grape cells. In response to different EFS, quantities of detected metabolites in grape cells varied from 6 to 17 in this assay, and 1 to 11 novel metabolites were introduced into metabolome of grape cells.

The offer of novel edible oils from herbs, spices and fruit seeds has grown and many of them are used as functional food and dietary supplements but also as feed additives in animal feeding. Poultry meat is recommended.in properly balanced diet and its consumption in Poland has been growing. The objective of present study was to verify if the supplementation of chickens' diet with grape seed oil or pomegranate seed oil influences cholesterol content and fatty acids (FA) profile in their livers. Ross 308 chickens (n = 24) were fed with fodder enriched with grape seed oil (G group) or pomegranate seed oil (P group). Diet of control group (C group) was based on soybean oil. FA analysis in livers as well as cholesterol content was made with gas chromatography. We observed significant increase in fat content when part of soybean oil was replaced by grape seed oil (p = 0.0002). Its highest amount was detected in G group (4.44 ± 1.53%) whereas the lowest in C group (1.73 ± 0.53%). Applied supplementation did not change total cholesterol content. Its content ranged from 233.0 ± 12.2 mg/100 g in G group to 234.6 ± 29.7 mg1100 g in C group. However, chickens' diet modification with grape seed oil and pomegranate seed oil influenced the FA profile in livers. We detected the presence of punicic acid (cis-9, trans-11, cis-13 C18:3, PA) in livers of chicken fed with pomegranate seed oil. Pomegranate seed oil is one of natural sources of conjugated linolenic acids (CLnA), which predominate in this oil (PA >70% of all FA). However, in livers PA constituted only 0.90 ± 0.10% of all fatty acids. Furthermore, we detected substantial amounts of rumenic acid (cis-9, trans-11 C18:2, RA) - the major isomer of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). Its natural sources in diet are meat and milk of ruminants, but incorporation of pomegranate seed oil into chickens' diet caused a significant increase of its share in fatty acids pool in their livers (3.73 ? 0.79% in P group in relation to 0.08 ± 0.03% in G group and 0.02 ± 0.00% in C group, p < 0.0001).

Ectopic expression of VpSTS29 in Arabidopsis shows the presence of VpSTS29 in oil bodies and increases trans-piceid in developing leaves. Stilbenes are the natural antimicrobial phytoalexins that are synthesised via the phenylpropanoid pathway. STS is the key enzyme catalysing the production of stilbenes. We have previously reported that the VpSTS29 gene plays an important role in powdery mildew resistance in Vitis pseudoreticulata. However, the synthesis and accumulation of these stilbene products in plant cells remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that VpSTS29 is present in cytosolic oil bodies and can be transported into the vacuole at particular plant-developmental stages. Western blot and high-performance liquid chromatography showed that STS and trans-piceid accumulated in senescent grape leaves and in pVpSTS29::VpSTS29-expressing Arabidopsis during age-dependent leaf senescence. Subcellular localisation analyses indicated VpSTS29-GFP was present in the cytoplasm and in STS-containing bodies in Arabidopsis. Nile red staining, co-localisation and immunohistochemistry analyses of leaves confirmed that the STS-containing bodies were oil bodies and that these moved randomly in the cytoplasm and vacuole. Detection of protein profiles revealed that no free GFP was detected in the pVpSTS29::VpSTS29-GFP-expressing protoplasts or in Arabidopsis during the dark-light cycle, demonstrating that GFP fluorescence distributed in the STS-containing bodies and vacuole was the VpSTS29-GFP fusion protein. Intriguingly, in comparison to the controls, over-expression of VpSTS29 in Arabidopsis resulted in relatively high levels of trans-piceid, chlorophyll content and of photochemical efficiency accompanied by delayed leaf senescence.

Adult insects may utilize microbial-derived nutrients to prolong their lifespan, promote egg development, and offer a high nutritional substrate to their offspring. Here, we examined the behavioral role of semiochemicals from grape-microbe interactions on oviposition and field attraction of the grapevine moth Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermüller). The volatile constituents released by grape inoculated with yeasts (Hanseniaspora uvarum (Niehaus), Metschnikowia pulcherrima (Pitt.) M.W. Miller, Pichia anomala, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Meyen ex E.C. Hansen, and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (Boutroux) Yarrow), sour rot bacteria (Acetobacter aceti (Pasteur) Beijerinck and Gluconobacter oxydans (Henneberg) De Ley), and a fungal pathogen (Botrytis cinerea Pers.) all endemic of the vineyard were sampled by solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and ethyl acetate were the most common volatiles released from all microbe-inoculated grapes. In addition, acetic acid was released at a substantial amount following bacteria inoculation and in a three-way inoculation with yeasts and the fungus. 2-phenylethanol, a compound reported to attract tortricid moths when used in combination with acetic acid, was found at a relatively low level in all microbial combinations as well as in the control grape. While grapes inoculated with a consortium of yeasts stimulated oviposition in comparison with uninoculated berries, the phytopathogenic fungus deterred egg-laying. Nonetheless, the highest preference to lay eggs was measured when the yeasts were co-inoculated with the fungus. The lowest preference was obtained when grapes were inoculated with sour rot bacteria and their binary co-inoculation with yeasts and the fungus. Interestingly, oviposition on berries simultaneously inoculated with all the three microbial groups was unaffected. Lures loaded with either acetic acid or 2-phenylethanol were not attractive when placed in traps as single component in vineyards, but a binary blend attracted both sexes of grapevine moth in significant numbers. Further addition of the three most common volatiles released by infected berries (ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and ethyl acetate) did not significantly increase moth catch with this binary blend.

Both low-pressure gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LPGC-MS/MS) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS/MS were used for analysis. An empirical approach was followed to isolate and estimate the measurement uncertainty contribution of each step in the overall method by adding quality control spikes prior to each step. Addition of an internal standard during extraction normalized the sample preparation step to 0% error contribution, and coefficients of variation (CVs) were 6-7% for the analytical steps (LC and GC) and 6-9% for the sample processing techniques. In practice, overall CVs averaged 9-11% among the different analytes, commodities, batches, test portion weights, and analytical and sample processing methods. On average, CVs increased up to 4% and bias 8-12% when using 1-2 g test portions vs. 10-15 g.

This study aimed to disassemble this broad peak and explore the polymeric tannin molecules inside. By applying centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), an efficient separation approach was developed to split the broad peak of grape seed tannins into fractions. Then, the fractions were analyzed by Q-ToF (quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry) to determine the corresponding structures of the tannins. The results suggest that grape seed polymeric tannins were eluted consecutively according to their degree of polymerization (DP).

29331860,"Grape canes, the residues from the annual pruning of vines, contain high levels of inducible (E)-resveratrol and also oligomeric stilbenoids and proanthocyanidins. These two families of phenolic compounds are bioactive, but to quantify them in a single chromatographic run using only ultraviolet detection is a difficult task. To overcome this limitation, a chromatographic method was developed using a core shell column for separation, an ultraviolet-visible diode array detector (DAD) and a fluorescence (FL) detector connected in series for quantification, with an electrospray ionization interface (ESI) and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometric detector (MS/MS) added for identification of the analytes. The proanthocyanidins (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidins B1, B2, and C1, an unknown dimer and trimer, two prodelphinidin dimers, and monogallate procyanidin dimers were detected in the tested grape cane samples. The stilbenoids detected were (E)-resveratrol, (E)-piceatannol, (E)-piceid, (E)-ε-viniferin, vitisin B, a glycosylated monomer, three oxidized dimers, an unknown dimer and a tetramer, pallidol, hopeaphenol, (E)-δ-viniferin, and (E)-ω-viniferin. However, this method required 60min for each analysis. A faster and more efficient method for quantitative analysis was developed based on HPLC-DAD-FL, reducing the time required to 24min for the simultaneous quantification of proanthocyanidins and stilbenoids in Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and Tintorera grape canes stored at controlled temperatures and relativity humidities for 134days after pruning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a prodelphinidin dimer has been quantified in grape canes. The incorporation of fluorescence detection in series with DAD not only allowed the quantification of proanthocyanidins, it also improved the detectability of some minor stilbenoids present in the canes, such as (E)-piceid. The (E)-resveratrol and (E)-piceatannol levels increased significantly during cane storage, while those of (E)-ε-viniferin and ampelopsin A did not show significant increases. The relative humidity had a determining effect on the levels of (E)-resveratrol and (E)-piceatannol in the canes of all varieties studied; their concentrations were higher at a relative humidity of 60% than at 70%. This is the first time that the proanthocyanidin profiles of canes stored after pruning were monitored under controlled conditions of temperature, time and relative humidity. The concentration of (-)-epicatechin decreased during storage under both relative humidities. Furthermore, the levels of proanthocyanidin B1 and the prodelphinidin dimer also decreased to a certain extent.","Journal of chromatography.

The chemical complexity associated with PACs has triggered the development of various chromatographic techniques, with countercurrent separation (CCS) gaining in popularity. This study applied the recently developed DESIGNER (Depletion and Enrichment of Select Ingredients Generating Normalized Extract Resources) approach for the selective enrichment of trimeric and tetrameric PACs using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). This CPC method aims at developing PAC based biomaterials, particularly for their application in restoring and repairing dental hard tissue. A general separation scheme beginning with the depletion of polymeric PACs, followed by the removal of monomeric flavan-3-ols and a final enrichment step produced PAC trimer and tetramer enriched fractions. A successful application of this separation scheme is demonstrated for four polyphenol rich plant sources: grape seeds, pine bark, cinnamon bark, and cocoa seeds. Minor modifications to the generic DESIGNER CCS method were sufficient to accommodate the varying chemical complexities of the individual source materials. The step-wise enrichment of PAC trimers and tetramers was monitored using normal phase TLC and Diol-HPLC-UV analyses.

29329885,"Despite continuous advances in analytical and physiological knowledge, the comprehension of an aroma is still a challenge. Gas chromatography coupled to olfactometry (GC-O) is an efficient method to identify and estimate individual potential of odorants, but there is a gap between this individual characterization and the effective contribution of compounds in the mixture, which is due to complex chemical and perceptual interactions. Therefore, recombination and omission experiments are often performed to achieve an understanding of food aromas. In this study, a chromatographic device, developed to facilitate aroma analysis, is presented. It was configured to perform both (1) conventional analyses by GC coupled with a mass spectrometer, olfactometric port(s), and a flame ionization detector (FID), and (2) omission or recombination experiments. This dual capability is due to the singular configuration of the system using an ingenious combination of splitter and Deans switch microfluidics transfer modules, and the existence of multiple outlets. The operational status of the system was tested using a purposely simple mixture of compounds. The similarity of retention times (RT) and FID peak areas obtained for each outlet demonstrates that the multiple outlets of the system are equivalent. The reproducibility of retention times (RT) and FID peak areas obtained in switching and non-switching conditions, also demonstrates the efficiency of switching operations. The validation of the system enables multiple detectors to be connected to the outlets and complementary information can be obtained from the eluate. The connection of recovery disposals to the outlets provides fraction collection and recombination possibilities, which contribute much to the understanding of aroma-aroma interactions. As an illustration of the InnOscent system relevance for the comprehension of more complex aromas, the device was used to study the aroma of a wine made from Cabernet Franc grape variety. An olfactometric profile was efficiently produced with the device configured as a GC-MS coupled to a dual olfactometric port. The main odorant active compounds were identified. The omission approach, carried out with the system on isopropyl- and isobutyl-methoxypyrazines, demonstrates the significant contribution of these compounds to the aroma of the wine studied, despite an individual perception among the weakest of the aromagram. A similar approach can be used to evaluate the contribution of any compound to any aroma.

Total phenol contents were 107.39±8.94mg GAE/g dw of grape seeds for grape seed extract (GSE) and 218.32±10.66mg GAE/g dw of grape seeds for acid-hydrolyzed grape seed extract (AcGSE). The extracts were analyzed by HPLC-DAD system and the results showed the presence of catechin, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid and ellagic acid in the processed methanolic extract and cyanidin, gallic acid and ellagic acid in the processed acidified methanolic extract. The protective abilities of catechin and cyanidin were tested against the oxidation of DNA. The results showed that cyanidin has better protection of DNA against oxidation than catechin. GSE and AcGSE were revealed to inhibit the oxidatively induced DNA damage. GSE decreased about 57% of damage caused by the Fenton control sample.

In this study, further characterization of PAU5 regarding its foam-stabilizing properties was performed to elucidate whether PAU5 has foam-stabilizing properties and therefore, to elucidate a direct influence on the gushing potential of sparkling wines. PAU5 was successfully purified from non-gushing sparkling wine using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Pure protein was added to grape juice as a model system for grape must prior to foam stability testing. The results revealed that the protein PAU5 has foam-stabilizing properties. Furthermore, the influence of heat and sulfur treatment in the presence of Botrytis cinerea was analyzed with regard to the amount of PAU5 produced by S. cerevisiae fermented in grape juice. Fermentation experiments using two different S. cerevisiae strains were performed, and the concentration of PAU5 in the samples was compared by RP-HPLC analysis. Unlike sulfur treatment, heat treatment prevented the protein degradation induced by B. cinerea and resulted in even higher amounts of PAU5 compared to the juice fermented with yeast without a previous botrytization. The two different yeast strains applied secreted PAU5 into the surrounding medium in different amounts. In further experiments, the fining process of the wine with bentonite was examined for its potential to remove PAU5 from the wine. RP-HPLC of wines processed with different fining agents revealed that bentonite treatment affected PAU5 concentrations in the final product. The extent of PAU5 removal depended on the type of bentonite applied and on the time of addition during the production process.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D001546', 'D020171', 'D002253', 'D002851', 'D056148', 'D005079', 'D005285', 'D005516', 'D005638', 'D008565', 'D055550', 'D012441', 'D029701', 'D013696', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Bentonite', 'Botrytis', 'Carbonated Beverages', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Reverse-Phase', 'Excipients', 'Fermentation', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fruit', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Protein Stability', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Temperature', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Foam-stabilizing properties of the yeast protein PAU5 and evaluation of factors that can influence its concentration in must and wine.,"['Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000382', None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000382', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000382']","['chemistry', 'metabolism', 'microbiology', None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'methods', 'microbiology', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'microbiology', 'microbiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29195929,2019

We performed a shade cloth trial covering the fruit zone (from pepper-corn size to maturity) with four polyethylene 1 m curtains with different optical properties (20% shading factor Pearl colored and 40% shading factor Aluminet, Blue, and Black colored) and a Control with no cover. Cluster temperature was 3.7 °C lower on the Southwest side in Black-40% clusters during the warmest part of the day compared to Control. Results indicated a lower berry weight under the Aluminet-40%. Berries under the nets often had significantly lower pH and higher TA than Control, but only the Black-40% were significant at harvest. Black-40% had higher values of anthocyanins than Control toward the last weeks of development. Berry skin flavonol and anthocyanin composition and concentration were measured by C18 reversed-phased HPLC; and proanthocyanidin isolates were characterized by acid catalysis in the presence of excess phloroglucinol followed by reversed-phase HPLC. Proanthocyanidins and flavonol contents were lower in Black-40% before veraison and the first part of ripening, respectively. However, their contents in Control decreased toward the end of ripening to a point where any net was different from Control. Anthocyanin and flavonol profiles were richer in 3', 4', 5' hydroxylated forms. Proanthocyanidin chain length was not affected while small changes were observed in the proportion of terminal catechin/epicatechin and in seed galloylation in response to treatments.

29053756,"Vitis vinifera cv. Koshu is an indigenous grape cultivar that has been cultivated for more than a thousand years in Japan and one of the most important cultivars in white winemaking. To improve Koshu wine quality, it is necessary to identify the metabolites in Koshu berry. We conducted a comprehensive and comparative lipidome analysis of Koshu and Pinot Noir berries cultivated in the same location in Japan using GC-MS/MS for fatty acids and LC-MS for glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. Koshu skins and juices contained 22 and 19 fatty acids, respectively, whereas 23 and 20 fatty acids were detected in Pinot Noir skins and juices. C22:6n3 and C24:0 contents in Koshu skins were two and three times higher than those in Pinot Noir skins. C24:0 content in Koshu juices was also higher than that in Pinot Noir juices. Forty-nine lipid components (six digalactosyldiacylglycerols, one monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, 10 phosphatidylcholines, 12 phosphatidylethanolamines, and 20 triglycerides) were detected in Pinot Noir and Koshu skins. Strong peaks were observed for MGDG 36:6, DGDG 36:6, PC 34:2, PC 36:5, TG 54:6, TG 54:7, and TG 54:8 in Koshu skins. The contents of 36 of the 49 lipid components were significantly higher in Pinot Noir skins than Koshu skins. Pinot Noir skins contained more lipids whose alkyl chains have more than 18 carbons than Koshu skins. Further analysis of both lipid profiles revealed that the number of double bonds in a fatty acid molecule in Pinot Noir skins and juices was significantly larger than that in Koshu skins and juices. A strong relationship exists between the heat requirement of grapevine cultivars and the level of fatty acid desaturation. C18-fatty acids were the major components in Koshu and Pinot Noir berries. The expression levels of C18-fatty acid desaturases regulated the accumulation of C18-unsaturated fatty acids in berry skins. The loss of C18:3 in Koshu berries at the end of ripening was observed. Koshu might effectively convert C18:3 into (Z)-hex-3-enal for the production of C6-aroma compounds.

28965401,"Ambient ionization mass spectrometric (AI-MS) techniques like direct analysis in real time (DART) offer the potential for rapid quantitative analyses of trace volatiles in food matrices, but performance is generally limited by the lack of preconcentration and extraction steps. The sensitivity and selectivity of AI-MS approaches can be improved through solid-phase microextraction (SPME) with appropriate thin-film geometries, for example, solid-phase mesh-enhanced sorption from headspace (SPMESH). This work improves the SPMESH-DART-MS approach for use in food analyses and validates the approach for trace volatile analysis for two compounds in real samples (grape macerates). SPMESH units prepared with different sorbent coatings were evaluated for their ability to extract a range of odor-active volatiles, with poly(dimethylsiloxane)/divinylbenzene giving the most satisfactory results. In combination with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), detection limits for SPMESH-DART-MS under 4 ng/L in less than 30 s acquisition times could be achieved for some volatiles [3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) and β-damascenone].

28964370,"Grapes's sun-dried process is one of the most critical steps in the production of 'Commandaria', a dessert wine product that is exclusively produced in Cyprus and derived from must obtained from two indigenous grape cultivars, namely 'Mavro' and 'Xynisteri'. Despite its significant economic importance, no data regarding the primary and secondary metabolites of the aforementioned cultivars exist. Thus, in the current study, the effect of sun drying process on the qualitative attributes and phenolic profile of 'Mavro' and 'Xynisteri' musts was dissected. Musts were analyzed at harvest and at the end of the sun-drying process that corresponds to ca. 30-40% water loss. Results highlighted significant differences in chemical composition of the must before and after the sun-drying process. Except for the increase of soluble solids content, a significant increment in glucose, fructose, total acidity, total phenols and total flavonoids contents was monitored. Subsequently, forty-two phenolic compounds were identified by LC-DAD-qTOF-MS revealing the polyphenolic fingerprint of the two cultivars. Results also indicated that changes in the phenolic composition of the obtained must are not only correlated with the dehydration effect, but both synthesis or degradation reactions occurred. In particular, the increases in the concentration of hydroxybenzoic acids were higher than the concentration effect for both cultivars. Regarding to hydroxycinnamates, dehydration caused a six-fold increase of hydroxycinnamic acid content in both cultivars. Intriguingly, the concentration of some hydroxycinnamic acids such as caffeic acid dihexoside and fertaric acid isomer went descending. Although the degradation of the internal side of the skin facilitate improved extractability from the skins to the grape pulp and therefore to the grape must, the sun-drying process may also induced stilbene and lignans synthesis production. A significant effect of dehydration on the postharvest biosynthesis of three groups of flavonoids (flavonols, flavan-3-ols, flavanonols), was also observed. This study sheds some light in the substantial changes that occur in specific metabolites during the sun drying process; such metabolites can be considered as potential factors that may determine organoleptic characteristics and biological properties of the end-product.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D002851', 'D003535', 'D003890', 'D005638', 'D010936', 'D013472', 'D053719', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyprus', 'Desiccation', 'Fruit', 'Plant Extracts', 'Sunlight', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Metabolic fingerprinting of must obtained from sun-dried grapes of two indigenous Cypriot cultivars destined for the production of 'Commandaria': A protected destignation of origin product.,"['Q000379', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['methods', None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28964370,2019

Winemaking by-products showed higher contents of total anthocyanins, flavonols, stilbenes, and flavanols than red wine as evaluated by HPLC-DAD-FD (on a dry weight basis). In contrast, red wine was a better source of phenolic acids. However, the contribution of phenolic acids was minor for both samples.

Among the foliar symptom expressions, the apoplectic form may be distinguished and characterized by sudden dieback of shoots, leaf drop, and shriveling of grape clusters in a few days that can ultimately induce the plant death. To further understand this drastic event, we conducted transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to characterize responses of leaves during the period preceding symptom appearance (20 and 7 days before foliar symptom expression) and at the day of apoplexy expression. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses provide signatures for the apoplectic leaves and most changes concerning the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and phenylpropanoids.

Ethanol treatment led to higher phenol yields than water extraction, while DP samples showed the highest capacity of releasing polyphenols, most probably as a positive consequence of the pomace drying process. Different compositions and bioactivities were observed between water and ethanol extracts and among different treatments and for the first time the anti-tyrosinase activity of V. vinifera pomace extracts, was here reported. Enzymatic treatments did not significantly improve the total amount of solubilised compounds; Celluclast in DP led to the recovery of extracts enriched in specific compounds, when compared to control.

Aspergillus section Nigri populations were isolated from grapes of the varieties 'Maratheftiko' and 'Cabernet Sauvignon' originating from six growing regions of Cyprus during 2010 and 2011 years. The isolation frequency of Aspergillus section Nigri from grape samples was 43.3% and a total of 284 isolates were selected for further analyses based on the macroscopic characteristics of black aspergilli. The isolates were characterized by sequencing analysis of the calmodulin gene in order to identify species responsible for ochratoxin A (OTA) production. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates were grouped in three major clusters. The A. tubingensis cluster included 262 isolates (92.25%), the A. niger cluster included 15 isolates identified as A. niger (5.3%) and 6 isolates identified as A. welwitschiae (2.1%). One isolate was classified as A. carbonarius (0.35%) and was grouped in a cluster together with the reference isolates of A. carbonarius, A. sclerotioniger, A. sclerotiocarbonarius and A. ibericus. All the isolates were evaluated for their ochratoxigenic ability by HPLC coupled with a fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD) and the positive isolates were re-examined using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The Aspergillus carbonarius isolate produced an average quantity of 1436.1 ng OTA/g Czapek Yeast Agar (CYA); From the A. niger strains three isolates (20%) produced OTA and only one isolate from A. welwitschiae (16.7%) was proved ochratoxigenic with toxin production average at 23.9 ng/g and 9.1 ng/g CYA respectively.

The grapes were subjected to a postharvest dehydration process under controlled thermohygrometric conditions (16-18°C, 55-70 RH%, 0.6m/s air speed) with the aim to produce three different special wine types (fortified, sfursat, and passito) from fresh, partially dehydrated (27°Brix), and withered (36°Brix) grapes, respectively. Chemical traits of produced grapes and wines were then evaluated through spectrophotometric, HPLC, and GC-MS methods. Increased contents of skin phenolic compounds and reduced extractable contents of seed phenolic compounds were observed as dehydration progressed. Few significant differences were found in the anthocyanin profile of grapes, although the relative abundance of coumaroylated anthocyanins was higher in dehydrated grapes. The predominant free volatile compound found in grapes was geraniol, which decreased with increasing water loss, whereas the contents of major glycosylated volatile compounds increased even above the concentration effect. The changes in the phenolic composition among wines agreed with those among grape skins. Fortified wines were chromatically unsatisfactory probably due to the low content of total anthocyanins, whereas sfursat and passito wines meet good chromatic characteristics as a result of the concentration effect during grape dehydration. Fortified and sfursat wines had free aroma profiles richer in 2-phenylethanol and citronellol, whereas passito wines were mainly composed of 2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethyl acetate, citronellol being the predominant terpenol in all the wine types studied.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000080462', 'D000872', 'D002851', 'D003116', 'D003890', 'D005511', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D007558', 'D039821', 'D009812', 'D010636', 'D013045', 'D013634', 'D013729', 'D027843', 'D055549', 'D014867', 'D014920']","['Acyclic Monoterpenes', 'Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Color', 'Desiccation', 'Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Monoterpenes', 'Odorants', 'Phenols', 'Species Specificity', 'Tannins', 'Terpenes', 'Vitis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Water', 'Wine']","Comparison of fortified, sfursat, and passito wines produced from fresh and dehydrated grapes of aromatic black cv.

The availability of more resistant interspecific hybrid vine varieties, developed from crosses between Vitis vinifera and other Vitis species, has generated much interest, also due to the low environmental effect of production. However, hybrid grape wine composition and varietal differences between interspecific hybrids have not been well defined, particularly for the simple phenols profile. The dynamic of these phenols in wines, where the glycosylated forms can be transformed into the free ones during winemaking, also raises an increasing health interest by their role as antoxidants in wine consumers.

Specifically, the phenolic composition of 4 hybrid grape varieties (red, Cabernet Cantor and Prior; white, Muscaris and Solaris) and 2 European grape varieties (red, Merlot; white, Chardonnay) was investigated, focusing on free and glycosidically bound simple phenols and considering compound distribution in pulp, skin, seeds and wine. Using a targeted approach 53 free simple phenols and 7 glycosidic precursors were quantified with quantification limits ranging from 0.001 to 2mgKg","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000872', 'D002851', 'D005638', 'D006027', 'D006031', 'D006801', 'D006824', 'D010636', 'D013045', 'D053719', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fruit', 'Glycosides', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Phenols', 'Species Specificity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Targeted and untargeted high resolution mass approach for a putative profiling of glycosylated simple phenols in hybrid grapes.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None]","['analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610729,2019

Today, these genotypes are currently involved in breeding programmes in order to introgress traits resistant to pests and diseases in V. vinifera cultivars. Nevertheless, the metabolic composition of their grapes has not been widely investigated. This study aimed to explore in detail the metabolomic profile in terms of simple phenolic, proanthocyanidin, anthocyanin and lipid compounds in two hybrids and five American genotypes. The results were compared with those of two V. vinifera cultivars. A multi-targeted metabolomics approach using a combination of LC-MS and LC-DAD methods was used to identify and quantify 124 selected metabolites. The genotypes studied showed considerable variability in the metabolomic profile according to the grape composition of V. vinifera and other Vitis genotypes. As regards the composition of anthocyanins, not all wild genotypes contained both mono- and di-glucoside derivatives. Wild genotype 41B and V. vinifera cultivars contained only monoglucoside anthocyanins. The proanthocyanidins of non-V. vinifera genotypes were mainly rich in oligomers and short-chain polymers. The analysis of lipids in wild Vitis genotypes, here reported for the first time, showed the existence of a certain diversity in their composition suggesting a strong influence of the environmental conditions on the general lipid pattern.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000569', 'D000872', 'D002853', 'D005638', 'D005838', 'D005960', 'D006801', 'D006824', 'D050356', 'D013058', 'D055432', 'D010636', 'D000069600', 'D044945', 'D013045', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Americas', 'Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Fruit', 'Genotype', 'Glucosides', 'Humans', 'Hybridization, Genetic', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolomics', 'Phenols', 'Plant Breeding', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Species Specificity', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",The metabolomic profile of red non-V. vinifera genotypes.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000235', None]","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610726,2019

28475326,"Phenolic compounds are of crucial importance for red wine color and mouthfeel attributes. A large number of enzymatic and chemical reactions involving phenolic compounds take place during winemaking and aging. Despite the large number of published analytical methods for phenolic analyses, the values obtained may vary considerably. In addition, the existing scientific knowledge needs to be updated, but also critically evaluated and simplified for newcomers and wine industry partners. The most used and widely cited spectrophotometric methods for grape and wine phenolic analysis were identified through a bibliometric search using the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCIE) database accessed through the Web of Science (WOS) platform from Thompson Reuters. The selection of spectrophotometry was based on its ease of use as a routine analytical technique. On the basis of the number of citations, as well as the advantages and disadvantages reported, the modified Somers assay appears as a multistep, simple, and robust procedure that provides a good estimation of the state of the anthocyanins equilibria. Precipitation methods for total tannin levels have also been identified as preferred protocols for these types of compounds. Good reported correlations between methods (methylcellulose precipitable vs bovine serum albumin) and between these and perceived red wine astringency, in combination with the adaptation to high-throughput format, make them suitable for routine analysis. The bovine serum albumin tannin assay also allows for the estimation of the anthocyanins content with the measurement of small and large polymeric pigments.

Different types and grades of filter aids were analyzed for arsenic, lead, and cadmium with inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry. Potential factors affecting the transfer of heavy metals to juices during filtration treatments were evaluated. Effects of washing treatments on removal of heavy metals from filter aids were also determined. Results showed that diatomaceous earth (DE) generally contained a higher level of arsenic than perlite, whereas perlite had a higher lead content than DE. Cellulose contained the lowest level of arsenic among the surveyed filter aids. All samples of food-grade filter aids contained arsenic and lead levels that were below the U.S. Pharmacopeia and National Formulary limits of 10 ppm of total leachable arsenic and lead for food-grade DE filter aids. Two samples of arsenic-rich (>3 ppm) food-grade filter aids raised the level of arsenic in apple and grape juices during laboratory-scale filtration treatments, whereas three samples of low-arsenic (<1 ppm) food-grade filter aids did not affect arsenic levels in filtered juices. Filtration tests with simulated juices (pH 2.9 to 4.1, Brix [°Bx] 8.2 to 18.1, total suspended solids [TSS] 0.1 to 0.5%) showed that pH or sugar content had no effect on arsenic levels of filtered juices, whereas arsenic content of filtered juice was elevated when higher amounts of filter aid were used for filtration.

Conversely, HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analysis showed significantly lower anthocyanin content in PG skin than in RG skin, and PG had no detectable trihydroxylated anthocyanins. Total flavonols did not differ between the variants, although some quercetin derivate concentrations were lower in PG. HPLC-FLD analysis revealed slightly higher concentrations of epicatechin and a procyanidin dimer in PG seeds, although the antioxidant capacity of crude extracts from either variety did not differ significantly.

In this study, synergic interactions between antibiotics and grape pomace extract that contains high concentration of phenolic compounds were evaluated by the checkerboard method in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. To define which component of the extract is responsible for the synergic effect, phenolic compounds were identified by RP-HPLC and their relative abundance was determined. Combinations of extract with pure compounds identified there in were also evaluated. Results showed that the grape pomace extract combined with representatives of different classes of antibiotics as β-lactam, quinolone, fluoroquinolone, tetracycline and amphenicol act in synergy in all S. aureus and E. coli strains tested with FICI values varying from 0.031 to 0.155. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was reduced 4 to 75 times. The most abundant phenolic compounds identified in the extract were quercetin, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid and luteolin with relative abundance of 26.3, 24.4, 16.7 and 11.4%, respectively. All combinations of the extract with the components also showed synergy with FICI values varying from 0.031 to 0.5 and MIC reductions of 4 to 125 times with both bacteria strains. The relative abundance of phenolic compounds has no correlation with the obtained synergic effect, suggesting that the mechanism by which the synergic effect occurs is by a multi-objective action. It was also shown that combinations of grape pomace extract with antibiotics are not toxic for the HeLa cell line at concentrations in which the synergistic effect was observed (47 μg/mL of extract and 0.6-375 μg/mL antibiotics). Therefore, these combinations are good candidates for testing in animal models in order to enhance the effect of antibiotics of different classes and thus restore the currently unused clinical antibiotics due to the phenomenon of resistance.

Compositional analyses of finished wines included tannin and polysaccharide concentration, composition and size distribution by high-performance liquid chromatography, whereas the sensory profiles of wines were assessed by descriptive analysis. As expected, wines made from riper grapes were naturally higher in tannin and mannoprotein than wines made from grapes harvested earlier.

Then, multidimensional gas chromatography coupled with olfactometry and mass spectrometry (MDGC-O-MS/TOF) was used for molecular characterization of the aroma compounds associated with the green aromas. Surprisingly, eucalyptol (1,8-cineole), with menthol odor was highlighted and assayed at concentrations sometimes above its olfactory detection threshold in Cabernet Sauvignon and Fer Servadou wines. Sensory tests confirmed its impact at several concentrations detected in French red wines (up to 2.61 ± 0.03 μg/L) on the menthol nuance and overall green perception, particularly via an additive effect with IBMP. Quantitation of 1,8-cineole in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes during berry development in 2015 revealed its varietal origin with abundant concentrations in unripe berries and decrease during grape maturation.

27769428,"This investigation describes a general procedure for the selectivity mapping of molecularly imprinted polymers, using (E)-resveratrol-imprinted polymers as the exemplar, and polyphenolic compounds present in Pinot noir grape skin extracts as the test compounds. The procedure is based on the analysis of samples generated before and after solid-phase extraction of (E)-resveratrol and other polyphenols contained within the Pinot noir grape skins using (E)-resveratrol-imprinted polymers. Capillary reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI MS/MS) was then employed for compound analysis and identification. Under optimised solid-phase extraction conditions, the (E)-resveratrol-imprinted polymer showed high binding affinity and selectivity towards (E)-resveratrol, whilst no resveratrol was bound by the corresponding non-imprinted polymer. In addition, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and a dimer of catechin-methyl-5-furfuraldehyde, which share some structural features with (E)-resveratrol, were also bound by the (E)-resveratrol-imprinted polymer. Polyphenols that were non-specifically retained by both the imprinted and non-imprinted polymer were (+)-catechin, a B-type procyanidin and (-)-epicatechin. The compounds that did not bind to the (E)-resveratrol molecularly imprinted polymer had at least one of the following molecular characteristics in comparison to the (E)-resveratrol template: (i) different spatial arrangements of their phenolic hydroxyl groups, (ii) less than three or more than four phenolic hydroxyl groups, or (iii) contained a bulky substituent moiety. The results show that capillary RP-HPLC in conjunction with ESI MS/MS represent very useful techniques for mapping the selectivity of the binding sites of imprinted polymer.

27755556,"Muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE) is derived from muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia), a common red grape used to produce red wine. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) that serves as a survival mechanism to relieve ER stress and restore ER homeostasis. However, when persistent, ER stress can alter the cytoprotective functions of the UPR to promote autophagy and cell death. Although MSKE has been documented to induce apoptosis, it has not been linked to ER stress/UPR/autophagy. We hypothesized that MSKE may induce a severe ER stress response-mediated autophagy leading to apoptosis. As a model, we treated C4-2 prostate cancer cells with MSKE and performed a quantitative Tandem Mass Tag Isobaric Labeling proteomic analysis. ER stress response, autophagy and apoptosis were analyzed by western blot, acridine orange and TUNEL/Annexin V staining, respectively. Quantitative proteomics analysis indicated that ER stress response proteins, such as GRP78 were greatly elevated following treatment with MSKE. The up-regulation of pro-apoptotic markers PARP, caspase-12, cleaved caspase-3, -7, BAX and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic marker BCL2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis and apoptosis was visualized by increased TUNEL/Annexin V staining upon MSKE treatment. Moreover, increased acridine orange, and LC3B staining was detected in MSKE-treated cells, suggesting an ER stress/autophagy response. Finally, MSKE-mediated autophagy and apoptosis was antagonized by co-treatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor.

27619377,"The analysis of pesticides in food products requires accurate measurements for which standardised protocols have been developed. This paper reports the validation of QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe)-based methods applied to three different food samples (brown rice, red pepper and mandarin orange) analysed using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The validation of the analytical methods used to measure 113 pesticides, including various insecticides, fungicides and herbicides, was conducted in three food matrices and at three spiking levels by three different laboratories. The set of validated results was interpreted, statistically analysed and visualised using principal component analysis (PCA). Notably, the matrix effects in GC-MS analysis for most of the tested pesticides from different matrices were lowered to practical values (less than 30%) appropriate for routine analysis. This allowed for the quantification of pesticides in the samples using standard and analyte protectants (APs) in the reagent method blank as a screening measure, providing an alternative to matrix-matched calibration. Alternatively, the use of only one standardised calibration (grape matrix) in combination with APs also allowed for the qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of pesticides in different matrices. The inclusion of APs reduced the differences in the matrix-induced enhancement effects of various samples. The use of an internal standard (IS) to correct the matrix effects was also noted. The normalisation of the analyte peak with triphenyl phosphate (TPP) as an IS resulted in a slight improvement of validation values such as precision and linearity in only one laboratory, but it lowered the value of matrix effects in all three laboratories.","Food additives & contaminants.

To elucidate the mycotoxin risk in southeastern American wine, grape samples were collected from vineyards during harvest in 2013 and potentially mycotoxigenic fungi (Fusarium and Aspergillus) were isolated from the samples. Numerous Fusarium isolates were recovered and identified to the species level by comparison of translation elongation factor 1-α gene sequences to verified strains.

27518822,"Astringency perception, as an essential parameter for high-quality red wine, is principally elicited by condensed tannins in diversified chemical structures. Condensed tannins, which are also known as proanthocyanidins (PAs), belong to the flavonoid class of polyphenols and are incorporated by multiple flavan-3-ols units according to their degree of polymerization (DP). However, the influence of DP size of PAs on astringency perception remains unclear for decades. This controversy was mainly attributed to the lack of efficient strategies to isolate the PAs in non-galloylated forms and with individual degree size from grape/wine. In the present study, the astringency intensity of purified and identified grape oligomeric tannins (DP ranged from 1 to 5) was firstly explored. A novel non-solid phase strategy was used to rapidly exclude the galloylated PAs from the non-galloylated PAs and fractionate the latter according to their DP size. Then, a series of PAs with individual DP size and galloylation were purified by an approach of preparative hydrophilic interaction chromatography. Furthermore, purified compounds were identified by both normal phase HPLC-FLD and reverse phase UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF. Finally, the contribution of the astringency perception of the individual purified tannins was examined with a salivary protein binding ability test. The results were observed by HPLC-FLD and quantified by changes in PA concentration remaining in the filtrate. In summary, a new approach without a solid stationary phase was developed to isolate PAs according to their DP size.

This study used different combinations of purified recombinant pectinases with cell wall profiling tools to follow the deconstruction process during winemaking. Multivariate data analysis of the glycan microarray (CoMPP) and gas chromatography (GC) results revealed that pectin lyase performed almost as effectively in de-pectination as certain commercial enzyme mixtures. Surprisingly the combination of endo-polygalacturonase and pectin-methyl-esterase only unraveled the cell walls without de-pectination.

Wine volatiles were analyzed by multiple techniques, including headspace solid phase microextraction-GC-MS (HS-SPME-GC-MS), headspace-GC-FID (HS-GC-FID) and stir bar sorptive extraction-GC-MS (SBSE-GC-MS). Fruit zone leaf removal affected the concentration of many grape-derived volatile compounds such as terpene alcohols and C13-norisoprenoids in wine, although the degree of impact depended on the vintage year and severity of leaf removal. Fruit zone leaf removal resulted in greater concentrations of linalool, α-terpineol and β-damascenone but had no impact on other terpene alcohols or β-ionone. Fruit zone leaf removal had no consistent impact on C6 alcohols, volatile phenols, lactones, fermentation-derived alcohols, acids, or most esters.

27504956,"A MIP (Major Intrinsic Protein) subfamily called Uncharacterized Intrinsic Proteins (XIP) was recently described in several fungi and eudicot plants. In this work, we cloned a XIP from grapevine, VvXIP1, and agrobacterium-mediated transformation studies in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed that the encoded aquaporin shows a preferential localization at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Stopped-flow spectrometry in vesicles from the aqy-null yeast strain YSH1172 overexpressing VvXIP1 showed that VvXIP1 is unable to transport water but is permeable to glycerol. Functional studies with the ROS sensitive probe CM-H2DCFDA in intact transformed yeasts showed that VvXIP1 is also able to permeate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Drop test growth assays showed that besides glycerol and H2O2, VvXIP1 also transports boric acid, copper, arsenic and nickel. Furthermore, we found that VvXIP1 transcripts were abundant in grapevine leaves from field grown plants and strongly repressed after the imposition of severe water-deficit conditions in potted vines. The observed downregulation of VvXIP1 expression in cultured grape cells in response to ABA and salt, together with the increased sensitivity to osmotic stress displayed by the aqy-null yeast overexpressing VvXIP1, corroborates the role of VvXIP1 in osmotic regulation besides its involvement in H2O2 transport and metal homeostasis.

Several factors influencing the chromatographic separation of the As species, such as pH of the mobile phase, buffer solution concentration, buffer type, IL concentration and length of alkyl groups in ILs were evaluated. The complete separation of As species was achieved using a C18 column in isocratic mode with a mobile phase composed of 0.5% (v/v) 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C8mim]Cl) and 5% (v/v) methanol at pH 8.5. A multivariate methodology was used to optimize the variables involved in AFS detection of As species after they were separated by HPLC. The ILs showed remarkable performance for the separation of As species, which was obtained within 18min with a resolution higher than 0.83. The limits of detection for As(III), As(V), MMA and DMA were 0.81, 0.89, 0.62 and 1.00μg As L(-1).

C6 compounds were the basic background volatiles, but the aroma contents of pulp juice and skin depended mainly on the levels of esters and terpenes, respectively. Most obviously, 'Kyoho' grapevine series showed high contents of esters in pulp, while Muscat/floral cultivars showed abundant monoterpenes in skin. For the aroma series, table grapes were characterized mainly by herbaceous, floral, balsamic, sweet and fruity series. The simple and visualizable aroma profiles were established using aroma fingerprints based on the aromatic series. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the aroma profiles of pulp juice, skin and whole berries could be classified into 5, 3, and 5 groups, respectively.

The δ(15) N of grapes and wine was measured in bulk samples and compounds, specifically in proline, for the first time. Despite isotopic fractionation from soil to wine, the δ(15) N values of leaves, grapes, wine and particularly must and wine proline conserved the variability of δ(15) N in the growing soil. Fermentation and ultrasound treatment did not affect the δ(15) N values of grape must, which was therefore conserved in wine. The addition of inorganic or organic adjuvants was able to influence the δ(15) N of bulk wine, depending on the amount and the difference between the δ(15) N of must and that of the adjuvant.

The aim of this study was to compare the anti-inflammatory activity of five raisin extracts focusing on Interleukin (IL)-8 and Nuclear Factor (NF)-κB pathway. Raisin extracts were characterized by High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Diode Array Detector (HPLC-DAD) analysis and screened for their ability to inhibit Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α-induced IL-8 release and promoter activity in human gastric epithelial cells. Turkish variety significantly inhibited TNFα-induced IL-8 release, and the effect was due to the impairment of the corresponding promoter activity. Macroscopic evaluation showed the presence of seeds, absent in the other varieties; thus, hydro-alcoholic extracts from fruits and seeds were individually tested on IL-8 and NF-κB pathway. Seed extract inhibited IL-8 and NF-κB pathway, showing higher potency with respect to the fruit.

Fifteen grape volatiles with different polarities, known to have an important impact on varietal wine aroma, were tested. The affinity of each tested molecule to the new coatings was assessed. The PDMS coating showed higher relative areas for terpenes (β-citronellol, geraniol, linalool and α-terpineol) and norisoprenoids (β-ionone), especially when the CIS temperature was set at 25°C. C6 compounds such as 1-hexanol, (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, and benzaldehyde and eugenol, obtained greater area response using EG-Silicone and PA coatings, regardless the temperatures. The memory effect of each coating type was studied; EG Silicone and PA coatings showed a higher memory effect for a certain compounds, probably due to the lower desorption temperature that EG Silicone and PA coatings can be submitted to, respect to PDMS (220°C the former two, 295°C the latter).

Both the tail-head and head-tail elution modes were used with a flow rate of 3.0ml/min and a rotary speed of 950rpm. Afterwards, a preparative-HPLC separation was applied to isolate individual polyphenols in each of the fractions from HSCCC. Total of 7 fractions (Fraction A to G) were obtained from grape skin extract by HSCCC. After preparative-HPLC isolation, fifteen individual compounds were obtained, most of which presented high yields and purity (all over 90%).

In this study the extraction conditions for the maximum recovery of total phenolic content (TPC) with high DPPH scavenging capacities (DPPHsc) were analyzed for kiwi fruit seed polyphenols (KSP) by response surface methodology. The optimal conditions for the highest yield of TPC (53.73 mg GAE/g DW) with 63.25% DPPHsc was found by using an extraction time of 79.65 min with an eluent containing 59.45% acetone at 38.35 °C and a 1:11.52 (w/v) solid/liquid ratio. Compared with butyl hydroxy toluene (BHT), a synthetic antioxidant, the extracted KSP showed higher DPPHsc and ferric reducing antioxidant power, but was less efficient than grape seed polyphenols extracted under the same optimum conditions. We also showed that the extracted KSP exhibited strong anti-inflammatory activities by suppressing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. High performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) analysis of the extracted KSP under optimized conditions revealed that the extract was mainly composed of five polyphenolic compounds.

Plant sterols, also called phytosterols (PS), are secondary metabolites regarded as bioactive substance present in grape berries and other plant-based food. The present study deals with a metabolomic approach focusing on phytosterols family in six varieties of Rioja grapes (Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Graciano, Garnacha, White Garnacha and Viura), in order to find significant differences among them. Liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry with a quadrupole-time of flight mass analyzer (LC-QTOF) was used to find as many metabolites as possible in the different grape berry fractions, and using statistics to help finding significant clustering of the metabolic profile of pulp, peel and seeds in relation to the variety. The best chromatographic and detection conditions were achieved by gas phase ionization via atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in positive mode. Furthermore, analysis with electrospray (ESI) is also needed for phytosterol derivatives confirmation. Putative compounds of interest in the analyzed samples were found by an automated compound extraction algorithm (Molecular Feature Extraction, MFE) and an initial differential expression from the data was created with the aid of commercial software. Once the data were collected, the results were filtered, aligned and normalized, and evaluating applying one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a 95% significance level. For sample class prediction, partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is used as a supervised pattern recognition method and excellent separation among the grape varieties is shown. An overall accuracy of 93.3% (pulp samples), 100.0% (peel) or 96.7% (seeds) in discriminating between grape varieties was achieved when comparing the different fractions.

We performed high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to estimate the phytohormone contents in grape leaves at different time points after the infection. Furthermore, we performed quantitative analyses of key genes such as EDS1, PAD4, ICS2, PAL, NPR1, TGA1, and PR1 in the systemic acquired resistance pathway by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed an increased variation in the SA content, which was maintained at high levels, after P. viticola infection in plant species exhibiting stronger resistance to the pathogen; this finding highlights the importance of SA in plant defense mechanisms. Moreover, EDS1 and PAD4 expression did not show a positive correlation with disease resistance in grape; however, higher expression of other genes that were analyzed was observed in highly resistant grape varieties.

Multiple regression analysis showed a high correlation between phenolic composition and AC of samples, being anthocyanins the main family with significant contribution to AC. In addition, quantitative differences in specific phenolic compounds help to explain differences in AC observed between varieties. A high phenolic content and bioactivity still remain in pomaces which support its use as an inexpensive source of antioxidants.

27130423,"Resveratrol dimers belong to a group of compounds called stilbenes, which along with proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins, catechins, and flavonols are natural phenolic compounds found in grapes and red wine. Stilbenes have a variety of structural isomers, all of which exhibit various biological properties. Counter-current chromatography with a two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water (2:5:4:5, v/v/v/v) was applied to isolate and purify stilbene from the stems of wine grape. Two isomers of resveratrol dimers trans-ε-viniferin and trans-δ-viniferin were obtained from the crude sample in a one-step separation, with purities of 93.2 and 97.5%, respectively, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The structures of these two compounds were identified by (1) H and (13) C NMR spectroscopy. In addition, their antioxidant activities were assessed by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The antioxidant activities of trans-δ-viniferin were higher than that of trans-ε-viniferin in this model. This work demonstrated that counter-current chromatography is a powerful and effective method for the isolation and purification of polyphenols from wine grape. Additionally, the DPPH radical assay showed that the isolated component trans-δ-viniferin exhibited stronger antioxidant activities than trans-ε-viniferin and a little bit weaker than vitamin E at the same concentration.

27130119,"Wine composition in polyphenols is related to the variety of grape that it contains. These polyphenols play an essential role in its quality as well as a possible protective effect on human health. Their conjugated aromatic structure renders them fluorescent, which means that 3D front-face fluorescence spectroscopy could be a useful tool to differentiate among the grape varieties that characterize each wine. However, fluorescence spectra acquired simply at the natural pH of wine are not always sufficient to discriminate the wines. The structural changes in the polyphenols resulting from modifications in the pH induce significant changes in their fluorescence spectra, making it possible to more clearly separate different wines. 9 wines belonging to three different grape varieties (Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir) and from 9 different producers, were analyzed over a range of pHs. Independent Components Analysis (ICA) was used to extract characteristic signals from the matrix of unfolded 3D front-face fluorescence spectra and showed that the introduction of pH as an additional parameter in the study of wine fluorescence improved the discrimination of wines.

27114223,"The main quest for the implementation of direct SPME to complex matrices has been the development of matrix compatible coatings that provide sufficient sensitivity towards the target analytes. In this context, we present here a thorough evaluation of PDMS-overcoated fibers suitable for simultaneous extraction of different polarities analytes, while maintaining adequate matrix compatibility. For this, eleven analytes were selected, from various application classes (pesticides, industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals) and with a wide range of log P values (ranging from 1.43 to 6). The model matrix chosen was commercial Concord grape juice, which is rich in pigments such as anthocyanins, and contains approximately 20% of sugar (w/w). Two types of PDMS, as well as other intrinsic factors associated with the PDMS-overcoated fiber fabrication are studied. The evaluation showed that the PDMS-overcoated fibers considerably slowed down the coating fouling process during direct immersion in complex matrices of high sugar content. Longevity differences could be seen between the two types of PDMS tested, with a proprietary Sylgard(®) giving superior performance because of lesser amount of reactive groups and enhanced hydrophobicity. Conversely, the thickness of the outer layer did not seem to have a significant effect on the fiber lifetime. We also demonstrate that the uniformity of the overcoated PDMS layer is paramount to the achievement of reliable data and extended fiber lifetime. Employing the optimum overcoated fiber, limits of detection (LOD) in the range of 0.2-1.3 ng/g could be achieved.

Changes on phenolic composition (HPLC-DAD-MS), copigmentation/polymerisation (spectrophotometry), and colour (Tristimulus and Differential Colorimetry) were assessed by multivariate statistical techniques. The addition of oak chips at shorter maceration times enhanced phenolic extraction, colour and its stabilisation in comparison to the traditional maceration.

In this experiment, the stereoselective behavior of benalaxyl was studied during the grape growth and wine-making process. A simple method based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a chiral column and UV detector was established to separate and determine the enantiomers of benalaxyl. Stereoselective degradation of the two enantiomers of benalaxyl was found in grapes. The degradation of both enantiomers followed pseudofirst-order kinetics, and the degradation rate of R-(-)-benalaxyl was faster than S-(+)-benalaxyl. The half-life of R-(-)-benalaxyl was 27 h, while the half-life of S-(+)-benalaxyl was 31 h. The enantiomer fraction value decreased from 0.50 to 0.34 and finally only S-(+)-benalaxyl could be detected. In the fermentation process, both enantiomers of benalaxyl were hardly degraded, and no configuration interconversion was observed.

26879930,"Plant triterpenoids are a diverse group of secondary metabolites with wide distribution, high chemical diversity and interesting pharmacological and antimicrobial properties. The first step in the biosynthesis of all triterpenoids is the cyclization of the 2,3-oxidosqualene precursor, catalyzed by oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs), which have characteristic product specificities. Biosynthesis and functions of pentacyclic triterpenes have been poorly studied in grapevine. In this study, we first investigated the profile of triterpenoids present in leaf cuticular waxes from eight Vitis vinifera cultivars cultivated in the Upper Rhine Valley. Further quantification of triterpenoids showed that these cultivars can be divided into two groups, characterized by high levels of lupeol (e.g., Pinot noir) or taraxerol (e.g., Gewurztraminer) respectively. We further analyzed the OSC family involved in the synthesis of pentacyclic triterpenes (called VvTTPSs) in the sequenced V. vinifera 40024 genome and found nine genes with similarity to previously characterized triterpene synthases. Phylogenetic analysis further showed that VvTTPS1-VvTTPS3 and VvTTPS5-VvTTPS9 belong to the β-amyrin synthase and multifunctional triterpene synthase clade, whereas VvTTPS10 belongs to the lupeol synthase clade. We studied the expression of several members of the VvTTPS family following biotic and abiotic stresses in V. vinifera 40024 as well as in the eight healthy cultivars. This study further revealed that one candidate gene, VvTTPS5, which does not belong to the lupeol synthase clade, is highly expressed in lupeol-rich cultivars. VvTTPS3, VvTTPS5, VvTTPS6, VvTTPS7 and VvTTPS10 were highly upregulated by UV stress, but only VvTTPS3, VvTTPS5, VvTTPS6 and VvTTPS10 were upregulated following downy mildew and gray mold infections respectively. These results suggest differential roles of VvTTPS against environmental stresses in grape leaves.

A full characterisation of this highly N-glycosylated protein is required to help understand its biological and biochemical significance in grapes. We have developed a mass spectrometry (MS)-based glycoproteomic approach wherein deglycosylated peptides are analysed by LC-MS/MS, while intact glycopeptides are characterised using a dedicated MS method to determine the attachment sites and micro-heterogeneity. For grape invertase, in parallel with deglycosylated peptides analysis, different enzymatic digestions were performed and glycopeptide detection was improved by enrichment method, nanoLC-MS and oxonium glycan ions. This MS-based glycoproteomic approach demonstrates that vacuolar invertase is glycosylated at all twelve potential N-glycosylation sites. Glycosylation is heterogeneous, with twelve glycoforms identified at six of the sites. The identification of several types of N-glycans is a major result to correlate with the surface and foaming properties of wine, the solubility, allergenicity, and protease resistance of wine proteins.

26791437,"Analytical approaches for the detection and quantitation of ochratoxin A (OTA) in blood serum and food products are high in demand. In this study, a fluorescent aptamer-based sensor (aptasensor) is developed for the selective and sensitive detection of OTA, based on a complementary strand of aptamer (CS) and two types of nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and silica nanoparticles (SNPs) coated with streptavidin. The fabricated aptasensor inherits the characteristics of SNPs, as enhancers of fluorescence intensity; AuNPs, such as large surface area and unique optical properties; and high affinity of the aptamer toward its target compared to its CS. In the absence of OTA, no FAM and biotin-labeled CS is in the environment of the SNPs coated with streptavidin, which leads to no fluorescence emission. In the presence of the target, an FAM and biotin-labeled CS-SNPs coated with streptavidin conjugate is formed, thus resulting in a very strong fluorescence emission. The designed fluorescent aptasensor exhibits high selectivity toward OTA with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.098 nM. Furthermore, the fabricated aptasensor was successfully applied for the detection of OTA in grape juice and serum with LODs of 0.113 and 0.152 nM, respectively.

26687319,"Color has a fundamental role for the qualitative evaluation and cultivar characterization of fruits. In grape, a normally functional pigment biosynthesis leads to the accumulation of a high quantity of anthocyanins. In this work, 28 Vitis vinifera L. cultivars accumulating low anthocyanins in berries were studied to characterize the biosynthetic dysfunctions in both a phenotypic and genotypic point of view. Reflectance spectroscopy, HPLC profiles and molecular markers related to VvMybA1 and VvMybA2 genes allowed a detailed description of the pigment-related characteristics of these cultivars. Data were consistent concerning the heterozygosity of the non-functional allele in both investigated genes, resulting in a low colored phenotype as described by reflectance. However, the variability in berry colour among our samples was not fully explained by MybA locus, probably due to specific interferences among the biosynthetic pathways, as suggested by the anthocyanin profile variations detected among our samples. The results presented in this work confirmed the importance of the genetic background: grapes accumulating high levels of cyanidin-3-O-glucosides (di-substituted anthocyanin) are generally originated by white cultivar retro-mutations and they seem to preserve the anomalies in the flavonoid hydroxylases enzymes which negatively affect the synthesis of tri-substituted anthocyanins.

26653458,"Methoxypyrazines are volatile compounds found in plants, microbes, and insects that have potent vegetal and earthy aromas. With sensory detection thresholds in the low ng L(-1) range, modest concentrations of these compounds can profoundly impact the aroma quality of foods and beverages, and high levels can lead to consumer rejection. The wine industry routinely analyzes the most prevalent methoxypyrazine, 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP), to aid in harvest decisions, since concentrations decrease during berry ripening. In addition to IBMP, three other methoxypyrazines IPMP (2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine), SBMP (2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine), and EMP (2-ethyl-3-methoxypyrazine) have been identified in grapes and/or wine and can impact aroma quality. Despite their routine analysis in the wine industry (mostly IBMP), accurate methoxypyrazine quantitation is hindered by two major challenges: sensitivity and resolution. With extremely low sensory detection thresholds (~8-15 ng L(-1) in wine for IBMP), highly sensitive analytical methods to quantify methoxypyrazines at trace levels are necessary. Here we were able to achieve resolution of IBMP as well as IPMP, EMP, and SBMP from co-eluting compounds using one-dimensional chromatography coupled to positive chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Three extraction techniques HS-SPME (headspace-solid phase microextraction), SBSE (stirbar sorptive extraction), and HSSE (headspace sorptive extraction) were validated and compared.

Bioactive compounds such as individual phenolic compounds and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were identified and quantified by spectrophotometric, chromatographic and spectral analyses. The sample of MI had the highest concentrations for total phenolic compounds and total flavonoids, while TE had the highest content for total monomeric anthocyanins. For all samples it was possible to identify 13 different anthocyanins by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS). Moreover, the GP samples showed phenolic acids; flavan-3-ols such as catechin; flavonols such as quercetin, rutin and kaempferol; and stilbenes such as trans-resveratrol. Therefore, grape pomace can be considered a source for the recovery of phenolic compounds having antioxidant activity as well as a rich source of PUFA. Thus it can be used as an ingredient in the development of new food products, since it is suitable for human consumption, and a viable alternative both to adding nutritional value to food and to reduce environmental contamination.

26590863,"(-)-Rotundone is a potent odorant molecule with a characteristic spicy aroma existing in various plants including grapevines (Vitis vinifera). It is considered to be a significant compound in wines and grapes because of its low sensory threshold and aroma properties. (-)-Rotundone was first identified in red wine made from the grape cultivar Syrah and here we report the identification of VvSTO2 as a α-guaiene 2-oxidase which can transform α-guaiene to (-)-rotundone in the grape cultivar Syrah. It is a cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme belonging to the CYP 71BE subfamily, which overlaps with the very large CYP71D family and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first functional characterization of an enzyme from this family. VvSTO2 was expressed at a higher level in the Syrah grape exocarp (skin) in accord with the localization of (-)-rotundone accumulation in grape berries. α-Guaiene was also detected in the Syrah grape exocarp at an extremely high concentration. These findings suggest that (-)-rotundone accumulation is regulated by the VvSTO2 expression along with the availability of α-guaiene as a precursor. VvSTO2 expression during grape maturation was considerably higher in Syrah grape exocarp compared to Merlot grape exocarp, consistent with the patterns of α-guaiene and (-)-rotundone accumulation. On the basis of these findings, we propose that VvSTO2 may be a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of (-)-rotundone in grapevines by acting as a α-guaiene 2-oxidase.

26590310,"Rotundone was initially identified as a grape-derived compound responsible for the peppery aroma of Shiraz wine varieties. It has subsequently been found in black and white pepper and several other spices. Because of its potent aroma, the molecular basis for rotundone formation is of particular relevance to grape and wine scientists and industry. We have identified and functionally characterized in planta a sesquiterpene synthase, VvGuaS, from developing grape berries, and have demonstrated that it produces the precursor of rotundone, α-guaiene, as its main product. The VvGuaS enzyme is a novel allele of the sesquiterpene synthase gene, VvTPS24, which has previously been reported to encode VvPNSeInt, an enzyme that produces a variety of selinene-type sesquiterpenes. This newly discovered VvTPS24 allele encodes an enzyme 99.5% identical to VvPNSeInt, with the differences comprising just 6 out of the 561 amino acid residues. Molecular modelling of the enzymes revealed that two of these residues, T414 and V530, are located in the active site of VvGuaS within 4 Å of the binding-site of the substrate, farnesyl pyrophosphate. Mutation of these two residues of VvGuaS into the corresponding polymorphisms in VvPNSeInt results in a complete functional conversion of one enzyme into the other, while mutation of each residue individually produces an intermediate change in the product profile. We have therefore demonstrated that VvGuaS, an enzyme responsible for production of the rotundone precursor, α-guaiene, is encoded by a novel allele of the previously characterized grapevine gene VvTPS24 and that two specific polymorphisms are responsible for functional differences between VvTPS24 alleles.

Torulene became the major carotene produced instead of torularhodin. Also, the unsaturated fatty acid C18:2 became the dominant fatty acid produced instead of the saturated C16:0, which was similar to the grape seed oil used in the two-phase media.

Magnetic calcium alginate beads were also prepared by adding magnetite in the formulation to allow fast removal from the aqueous solution with a magnet. Calcium alginate beads were added to commercial grape juice spiked with 20 μg/kg OTA and after 48 h of incubation a significant reduction (>80%), of the total OTA content was achieved, while in the subsequent phases (72-120 h) OTA was slowly released into the grape juice by alginate beads.

In general, these compounds are studied for grape chemotaxonomy and for nutraceutical purposes due to their relevant antioxidant activity. Non-anthocyanic flavonoid composition of five red hybrid grape varieties produced by crossing of V. vinifera, V. aestivalis, V. cinerea, V. berlandieri, V. labrusca, V. lincecumii, and V. rupestris were studied by liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. Thirty-one compounds were identified, including methylnaringenin, a tetrahydroxy-dimethoxyflavanone-hexoside, two flavonols (quercetin and a pentahydroxyflavone isomer), 20 glycoside flavonols (four quercetin, two myricetin, two kaempferol, three isorhamnetin, one laricitrin, two syringetin, one kaempferide and two dihydroflavonol derivatives; myricetin-glucoside-glucuronide; myricetin-diglucoside; syringetin-dihexoside), three flavan-3-ols (-)-epicatechin, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin gallate) and four proantocyanidins (procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, procyanidin B3 or B4/B5, procyanidin T2 or T3/T4/C1).

Measurements of δ(13)C have been performed on a set of 32 authentic wines and their ethanol recovered after distillation. The data, obtained by isotope ratio monitoring by mass spectrometry coupled to an elemental analyser (irm-EA/MS), show a high correlation between δ(13)C of the bulk wine and its ethanol, indicating that the distillation step is not necessary when the wine has not been submitted to any oenological treatment. Therefore, the ethanol/wine δ(13)C correlation can be used as an indicator of possible enrichment of the grape must or the wine with exogenous organic compounds. Wine ethanol δ(13)C is correlated to predawn leaf water potential (R(2) = 0.69), indicating that this parameter can be used as an indicator of vine water status. Position-specific (13)C analysis (PSIA) of ethanol extracted from wine, performed by isotope ratio monitoring by nuclear magnetic resonance (irm-(13)C NMR), confirmed the non-homogenous repartition of (13)C on ethanol skeleton. It is the δ(13)C of the methylene group of ethanol, compared to the methyl moiety, which is the most correlated to predawn leaf water potential, indicating that a phase of photorespiration of the vine during water stress period is most probably occurring due to stomata closure.

Menthiafolic acid was detected in all but one of the wine samples at concentrations ranging from 26 to 342 μg/L and in the juice samples from 16 to 236 μg/L. Various model fermentation experiments showed that some menthiafolic acid in wine could be generated from the grape-derived menthiafolic acid glucose ester (2b) during alcoholic and malolactic fermentation. Samples containing high concentrations of menthiafolic acid were also analyzed by enantioselective GC-MS and were shown to contain this compound in predominantly the (S)-configuration. Enantioselective analysis of wine lactone (1) in one of these samples, a four-year-old Chardonnay wine showed, for the first time, the presence of the 3R,3aR,7aS isomer of wine lactone (1b), which is the enantiomer of the form previously reported as the sole isomer present in young wine samples. The weakly odorous 3R,3aR,7aS 1b form comprised 69% of the total wine lactone in the sample. On the basis of the enantioselectivity of the hydrolytic conversion of menthiafolic acid to wine lactone at pH 3.0 determined previously and the relative proportions of (R)- and (S)-menthiafolic acid in the Chardonnay wine, the predicted ratio of wine lactone enantiomers that would be formed from hydrolysis at ambient temperature of the menthiafolic acid present in this wine was close to the ratio measured, which was consistent with menthiafolic acid being the major or sole precursor to wine lactone in this sample.

26320795,"In this work we present a novel approach for the identification of plant metabolites using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The workflow involves developing an in-house compound database consisting of exact masses of previously identified as well as putative compounds. The database is used to screen accurate mass spectrometry (MS) data to identify possible compound matches. Subsequent tandem MS data is acquired for possible matches and used for structural elucidation. The methodology is applied to profile monoterpene glycosides in Vitis vinifera cv. Muscat of Alexandria grape berries over three developmental stages. Monoterpenes are a subclass of terpenes, the largest class of plant secondary metabolites, and are found in two major forms in the plant, ""bound"" to one or more sugar moieties or ""free"" of said sugar moieties. In the free form, monoterpenes are noted for their fragrance and play important roles in plant defense and as attractants for pollinators. However, glycoconjugation renders these compounds odorless, and it is this form that the plant uses for monoterpene storage. In order to gain insight into monoterpene biochemistry and their fate in the plant an analysis of intact glycosides is essential. Eighteen monoterpene glycosides were identified including a monoterpene trisaccharide glycoside, which is tentatively identified here for this first time in any plant. Additionally, while previous studies have identified monoterpene malonylated glucosides in other grapevine tissue, we tentatively identify them for the first time in grape berries. This analytical approach can be readily applied to other plants and the workflow approach can also be used for other classes of compounds. This approach, in general, provides researchers with data to support the identification of putative compounds, which is especially useful when no standard is available.

The separation of 20 relevant polyphenols from grape pomace extracts (GPEs) was achieved in less than 12 min by using a Kinetex C18 column (3.0 mm × 100 mm, 2.6 μm) with a gradient system of ultrapure water (0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile, a temperature of 35 °C and a flow rate of 0.8 mL min(-1). The maximum backpressure reached was 327 bar, meaning the developed method is adequate for standard HPLC instruments. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by the determination of PPs in GPEs of different red grape varieties. Cabernet Sauvignon GPE showed the highest content of studied PPs (9804.2 μg g(-1)GPE) followed by Bonarda GPE (7302.0 μg g(-1)GPE). Besides the methodological development for a high throughput routine quality control of GPEs, this is the first report of PPs content for Bonarda and Aspirant Bouchet GPE, so the results add knowledge for these grape varieties cultivated in Argentina.",Food chemistry,"['D002851', 'D059808', 'D027843']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Polyphenols', 'Vitis']",Development of a high-performance liquid chromatography method based on a core-shell column approach for the rapid determination of multiclass polyphenols in grape pomaces.,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26304313,2016
26271945,"Volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) play a significant role in the aroma of foods and beverages. With very low sensory thresholds and strong unpleasant aromas, most VSCs are considered to have a negative impact on wine quality. In this study, headspace solid phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS) was used to analyze the time course of the biosynthesis of 12 VSCs formed during wine fermentation. Two different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the laboratory strain BY4743 and a commercial strain, F15, were assessed using two media: synthetic grape media and Sauvignon Blanc juice. Seven VSCs were detected above background, with three rising above their sensory thresholds. The data revealed remarkable differences in the timing and evolution of production during fermentation, with a transient spike in methanethiol production early during anaerobic growth. Heavier VSCs such as benzothiazole and S-ethyl thioacetate were produced at a steady rate throughout grape juice fermentation, whereas others, such as diethyl sulfide, appear toward the very end of the winemaking process. The results also demonstrate significant differences between yeast strains and fermentation media.

26212968,"Fourier transform (FT) near-infrared (NIR) and attenuated total reflection (ATR) FT mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse Vitis vinifera L. cv Sauvignon blanc grape berries. FT-NIR and ATR FT-MIR spectroscopy, coupled with spectral preprocessing and multivariate data analysis (MVDA), provided reliable methods to qualitatively assess berry samples at five distinct developmental stages: green, pre-véraison, véraison, post-véraison and ripe (harvest), without any prior metabolite extraction. Compared to NIR spectra, MIR spectra provided more reliable discrimination between the berry samples from the different developmental stages. Interestingly, ATR FT-MIR spectra from fresh homogenized berry samples proved more discriminatory than spectra from frozen homogenized berry samples. Different developmental stages were discriminated by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). In order to generate partial least squares (PLS) models from the MIR/NIR spectral datasets; the major sugars (glucose and fructose) and organic acids (malic acid, succinic acid and tartaric acid) were separated and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the data used as a reference dataset. PLS regression was used to develop calibration models to predict the concentration of the major sugars and organic acids in the berry samples from different developmental stages. Our data show that infrared (IR) spectroscopy could provide a rapid, reproducible and cost-effective alternative to the chromatographic analysis of the sugar and organic acid composition of grape berries at various developmental stages, using small sample volumes and requiring limited sample preparation. This provides scope and support for the possible development of hand-held devices to assess quality parameters in field-settings in real-time and non-destructively using IR technologies.

Although the transport of lipophilic molecules across the cuticle has been intensively studied, development of tools to measure the cuticle polarity has received little attention. We developed a rapid and simple analytical method to evaluate the polarity of cuticles in situ. This method uses Prodan, 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylaminonaphthalene), a medium-sensitive fluorescent probe. Tests on model surfaces with varied polarity (i.e., wax paraffin, polyethylene, C18) were carried out to test the feasibility of the measurement and to optimize the application of Prodan. Moreover, on the basis of the Kamlet-Taft solvatochromic comparison method, a relationship between the emission characteristics of Prodan and the number of carbon atoms in primary alcohols mimicking the solid medium was established. After optimization, the method was validated on three natural plant cuticles (leaf of Zamiifolia, skin of green pepper, and skin of white grape).

The extracts were prepared from healthy grapevine leaves and those infected by Plasmopara viticola (downy mildew). The phenolic composition of the grapevine leaf extracts was determined using spectrophotometric assays and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The radical scavenging activity of grapevine leaf extracts was determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay, and their antimicrobial activity was determined by microwell dilution tests. The total phenolic content was higher in healthy grapevine leaf extracts than in infected grapevine leaf extracts. The RP-HPLC analysis detected significant amounts of flavonols, phenolic acids, and flavan-3-ols, and small amounts of stilbenes in the grapevine leaf extracts. Compared with the infected grapevine leaf extracts, the healthy grapevine leaf extracts were richer in flavonols, phenolic acids, and flavan-3-ols, but had lower stilbenes contents. All extracts showed strong free radical scavenging activity, which was strongly correlated with the total phenolic content (R(2) = 0.978). The extracts showed a stronger antimicrobial activity towards Gram-positive bacterial strains than towards Gram-negative bacterial strains and yeast. The phenolic compounds in grapevine leaves were responsible for their strong radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities.

The adsorbent (Fe3O4@SiO2@GO-PEA) was then used in a magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of six organophosphorous pesticides (OPPs) including methyl parathion, fenitrothion, methidathion, ethion, methyl azinphos and coumaphos prior to gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus detection (GC-NPD). The fabricated adsorbent combines the advantages of superior adsorption capability of modified GO and magnetic separability of magnetite microparticles to provide high adsorption capacity, and easy isolation from sample solutions. The main experimental parameters affecting the extraction recovery of OPPs including extraction time, pH, adsorbent dosage, salt concentration, and desorption conditions were investigated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, linear responses were obtained in the concentration range of 0.06-200μgL(-1) with the determination coefficients (R(2)) between 0.9945 and 0.9996.

These soluble pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are extracted from grape berries. However, their distribution in different grape tissues is not well documented. In this study, proteins were first separately extracted from the skin, pulp and seed of Sauvignon Blanc grapes, followed by trypsin digestion and analysis by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Proteins identified included 75 proteins from Sauvignon Blanc grape skin, 63 from grape pulp and 35 from grape seed, mostly functionally classified as associated with metabolism and energy. Some were present exclusively in specific grape tissues; for example, proteins involved in photosynthesis were only detected in grape skin and proteins found in alcoholic fermentation were only detected in grape pulp. Moreover, proteins identified in grape seed were less diverse than those identified in grape skin and pulp. TLPs and chitinases were identified in both Sauvignon Blanc grape skin and pulp, but not in the seed. To relatively quantify the PR proteins, the protein extracts of grape tissues were seperated by HPLC first and then analysed by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that the protein fractions eluted at 9.3 min and 19.2 min under the chromatographic conditions of this study confirmed that these corresponded to TLPs and chitinases seperately. Thus, the relative quantification of TLPs and chitinases in protein extracts was carried out by comparing the area of corresponding peaks against the area of a thamautin standard. The results presented in this study clearly demonstrated the distribution of haze-forming PR proteins in grape berries, and the relative quantification of TLPs and chitinases could be applied in fast tracking of changes in PR proteins during grape growth and determination of PR proteins in berries at harvest.

26048823,"The abundance of lipids in plants is influenced by genotype and phenotype. Despite being a very important class of plant metabolites, knowledge of grape lipids is still very limited to date, with the exception of those located in seeds. Few investigations of grape lipids have shown that their profile depends on grape maturity, the variety and their location in the berry. Recent advances in liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry have paved the way for faster analysis of lipids with minimal sample preparation. Here we describe a validation method for the extraction, identification and quantification of different classes of grape lipids: fatty acids, sterols, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids using liquid chromatographic electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). The method was validated for 33 lipids, with linearity range (R(2)=0.95-1.00), LOQ (0.003-14.88 ng mL(-1)) and intraday and interday repeatability being evaluated for each lipid. The lipid profiling method developed was successfully applied to the analysis of 18 grape samples (10 red grape and 8 white grape varieties) from 4 different genetic groups: Vitis vinifera, Vitis non-vinifera, Muscat and hybrid; 33 lipids were identified and quantified. This method, which can be easily expanded to include further compounds and other plant tissues, is the starting point for analysis of the lipid profile in different grape tissues, an essential goal for better understanding the role of lipids in grape physiology.",Talanta,"['D002851', 'D005227', 'D020404', 'D057230', 'D008055', 'D021241', 'D013107', 'D013261', 'D053719', 'D013997', 'D027843']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fatty Acids', 'Glycerophospholipids', 'Limit of Detection', 'Lipids', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Sphingolipids', 'Sterols', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Time Factors', 'Vitis']","A rapid LC-MS/MS method for quantitative profiling of fatty acids, sterols, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in grapes.","['Q000191', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000191', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000191', None, 'Q000737']","['economics', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'economics', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'economics', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26048823,2016
26042139,"Inducing resistance in plants by the application of elicitors of defense reactions is an attractive plant protection strategy, particularly for grapevine (Vitis vinifera), which is susceptible to severe fungal diseases. Although induced resistance (IR) can be successful under controlled conditions, in most cases, IR is not sufficiently effective for practical disease control under outdoor conditions. Progress in the application of IR requires a better understanding of grapevine defense mechanisms and the ability to monitor defense markers to identify factors, such as physiological and environmental factors, that can impact IR in the vineyard. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are well-known plant defense compounds that have received little or no attention to date in the case of grape-pathogen interactions. This prompted us to investigate whether an elicitor, the sulfated laminarin (PS3), actually induces the production of VOCs in grapevine. An online analysis (proton-transfer-reaction quadrupole mass spectrometry) of VOC emissions in dynamic cuvettes and passive sampling in gas-tight bags with solid-phase microextraction-GC-MS under greenhouse conditions showed that PS3 elicited the emission of VOCs. Some of them, such as (E,E)-α-farnesene, may be good candidates as biomarkers of elicitor-IR, whereas methyl salicylate appears to be a biomarker of downy mildew infection. A negative correlation between VOC emission and disease severity suggests a positive role of VOCs in grape defense against diseases.

Chemical profiling was achieved through combined use of two orthogonal techniques, GC-MS and LC-HRMS, before and after enzymatic hydrolysis. The results show that both free and glycosidically bound aroma precursors behave differently in each different grape cultivar and species.

Therefore, the objective of this work has been to evaluate the ability of human oral microbiota to produce wine odorant aglycones from odourless grape glycosidic aroma precursors previously isolated from white grapes. To do so, two methodological approaches involving the use of typical oral bacteria or the whole oral microbiota isolated from human saliva were followed.

25807971,"To solve the problem of wine color instability in western China, different additives (the maceration enzymes Vinozym G and Ex-color, yeasts VR5 and Red Star, and commercial tannins) were added during alcoholic fermentation of Syrah (Vitis vinifera L.). The phenolic profile and color characteristics of wine were examined using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and CIELAB, respectively. The results showed that the combination of the enzyme Ex-color with the Red Star yeast eased the release of non-anthocyanins from grape berries into wine, whereas the use of enzyme Vinozym G and VR5 yeast enhanced the concentration of anthocyanins and achieved a higher red hue (a* value) and a lower yellow hue (b* value) in the wine. The addition of commercial tannins greatly promoted the level of gallic acid in the wine and led to a relatively higher concentration of anthocyanins. Partial least-squares regression analysis was used to find out the major phenolics, which were in close relation with color parameters; principal component analysis was used to evaluate the contribution of different winemaking techniques to wine color. The combination of these 2 analytic methods indicated that Vinozym G and VR5 yeast together with commercial tannins should be an appropriate combination to enhance the stability of wine color during alcohol fermentation, which was related to a significant increase in cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-acetyl)-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-coumaryl)-glucoside, trans-peonidin-3-O-(6-O-coumaryl)-glucoside, trans-malvidin-3-O-(6-O-coumaryl)-glucoside, and malvidin-3-O-(6-O-acetyl)-glucoside-pyruvic acid, all of which played an important role in stabilizing wine color.

The intake of polyphenols such as anthocyanins (ACN) could be improved by consuming smoothies and juices that are increasingly popular, especially in children; however, bioavailability data concerning food matrix effects are scarce. Thus, we conducted a randomised, cross-over, bioavailability study (n 10) to determine the bioavailability of ACN and their metabolites from an ACN-rich grape/blueberry juice (841 mg ACN/litre) and smoothie (983 mg ACN/litre) in vivo, and the uptake of a corresponding grape/blueberry extract in vitro. After the intake of beverage (0·33 litres), plasma and fractionated urine samples were collected and analysed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to MS. The most abundant ACN found in plasma and urine were malvidin and peonidin as native ACN and as glucuronidated metabolites as well as 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHB); minor ACN (delphinidin, cyanidin and petunidin) were only detected as native glycosides. Plasma pharmacokinetics and recoveries of urinary metabolites of ACN were not different for juice or smoothie intake; however, the phenolic acid 3,4-DHB was significantly better bioavailable from juice in comparison to smoothie. In vitro data with absorptive intestinal cells indicated that despite their weak chemical stability, ACN and 3,4-DHB could be detected at the basal side in their native forms. Whether smoothies as well as juices should be recommended to increase the intake of potentially health-promoting ACN and other polyphenols requires the consideration of other ingredients such as their relatively high sugar content.

The aim of this study was to investigate aroma profiles of red wines made from cv. Karaoğlan, a grape variety grown in Arapgir (Malatya, Turkey) and the effect of maceration time (5, 10, and 15 d) on free and bound aroma compounds and sensory properties. Three maceration times were applied in durations of 5, 10, and 15 d. Free and glycosidically bound aroma compounds were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in Karaoğlan wines, and the effect of different maceration times on aroma composition were evaluated. Results indicate that extended maceration time significantly influenced the aroma composition of wines both qualitatively and quantitatively. A total of 59 free and 22 bound aroma compounds were identified in the final wines. The maximum of free aroma content was achieved with 5 d of maceration, while 15 d of maceration gave the highest amount of glycosidically bound aroma compounds. From sensorial point of view, the wine produced with 10 d of maceration had the best panel score compared to wines with 5 and 15 d of maceration. This is the first study referring to the composition of aroma compounds of red wines made from cv. Karaoğlan.

The addition of increasing levels of dihydroquercetin-3-O-glucoside to a constant malvidin-3-O-glucoside concentration resulted in a hyperchromic effect associated with a darkening of the anthocyanin solutions, greater quantity of color and visual saturation, perceptible to the human eye. Copigmentation and thermodynamic measurements showed that dihydroquercetin-3-O-glucoside can act as an anthocyanin copigment, similar to other usual wine components like flavanols or phenolic acids, although apparently less efficient than flavonols.

In the present investigation, we successfully tested two protein hydrolysates from soybean (soy) and casein (cas) to trigger grapevine resistance against P. viticola. On Vitis vinifera cv. Marselan plants, the application of soy and cas reduced the infected leaf surface by 76 and 63%, as compared to the control, respectively.

On grapevine cell suspensions, a different free cytosolic calcium signature was recorded for each hydrolysate, whereas a similar transient phosphorylation of two MAP kinases of 45 and 49 kDa was observed. These signaling events were followed by transcriptome reprogramming, including the up-regulation of defense genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and the stilbene synthase enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of resveratrol, the main grapevine phytoalexin. Liquid chromatography analyses confirmed the production of resveratrol and its dimer metabolites, δ- and ε-viniferins. Overall, soy effects were more pronounced as compared to the cas ones.

25494944,"The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) is essential for stress responses and the formation of reproductive organs, but its role in fruit development and ripening is unclear. Conjugation of JA to isoleucine is a crucial step in the JA signaling pathway since only JA-Ile is recognized by the jasmonate receptor. The conjugation reaction is catalyzed by JA-amido synthetases, belonging to the family of Gretchen Hagen3 (GH3) proteins. Here, in vitro studies of two grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv Shiraz) GH3 enzymes, VvGH3-7 and VvGH3-9, demonstrated JA-conjugating activities with an overlapping range of amino acid substrates, including isoleucine. Expression studies of the corresponding genes in grape berries combined with JA and JA-Ile measurements suggested a primary role for JA signaling in fruit set and cell division and did not support an involvement of JA in the ripening process. In response to methyl JA (MeJA) treatment, and in wounded and unwounded (distal) leaves, VvGH3-9 transcripts accumulated, indicating a participation in the JA response. In contrast, VvGH3-7 was unresponsive to MeJA and local wounding, demonstrating a differential transcriptional regulation of VvGH3-7 and VvGH3-9. The transient induction of VvGH3-7 in unwounded, distal leaves was suggestive of the involvement of an unknown mobile wound signal.

The studied OPPs were azinphos-methyl, parathion-methyl, fenitrothion, diazinon and chlorpyrifos. For VLLME-SID, a mixture of low density solvents (1-dodecanol and hexane) was used as the extraction solvent under vortex agitation for enhancing dispersion. After complete dispersion, the emulsion was formed and the OPPs were extracted into extraction solvent droplets. Then, the emulsion was quickly broken up into two clear phases after the addition of AlCl3 as a demulsifier. Centrifugation was not required in this procedure. Under the optimal conditions, high enrichment factors (180-282), low limit of detections (LODs) (0.05-1 ng mL(-1)) and good precision (RSD≤7% for retention time and peak area) were obtained.

25462960,"Hyacinth (Hyacinthus orientalis) bulbs infected by Fusarium oxysporum showed the symptoms of gummosis. The purpose of this study was to clarify the hormonal regulation of gummosis and composition of gums from hyacinth bulbs. The application of ethephon (2-chloroethylphosphonic acid), an ethylene-releasing compound, at 2% (w/w, in lanolin) induced gummosis in hyacinth bulbs. Methyl jasmonate (JA-Me) at 1.5% (w/w, in lanolin) induced gummosis as well. Simultaneous application of JA-Me and ethephon further enhanced gummosis. Molecular mass distribution of hyacinth gums analyzed by gel permeation chromatography indicated that the gums were mainly homogenous polysaccharides with an average molecular weight of ca. 30kDa. Analysis of the sugar composition of the gums after hydrolysis revealed that the majority were arabinose (ca. 35%) and galactose (ca. 40%) together with small amounts of fucose, rhamnose and uronic acids (ca. 5%, respectively), suggesting that the gums are pectic arabinogalactans. These results indicate that jasmonates (JAs) interact with ethylene to stimulate sugar metabolism, producing pectic arabinogalactans, and vice versa, leading to gummosis. These findings, together with those from our previous studies in tulips (Tulipa gesneriana) and grape hyacinth (Muscari armeniacum), revealed that sugar metabolism and hormonal regulation relating to gummosis are different among species of bulbous plants.

Principle component analysis and hierarchical clustering showed a separation of the genotypes into six main groups, three red and three white. Anthocyanins mainly explained the variance between the different groups. Additionally, within the white varieties mainly flavonols and flavanols contributed to the chemical diversity identified. A genotype-specific rootstock effect was identified when separately analyzing the skin of the clones, and it was attributed mainly to resveratrol, quercetin 3-O-galactoside, citrate and malate. The metabolite profile of the varieties investigated reveals the chemical diversity existing among different groups of Muscat genotypes.

A Kinetex C18 reversed-phase column under gradient elution with 0.1 % formic acid aqueous solution and methanol mobile phases was used for the simultaneous determination of 26 polyphenols, allowing an acceptable separation in less than 22 min. Instrumental quality parameters such as limits of detection (LOD, values between 12 and 14 μg/L for 19 of the 26 analyzed polyphenols), linearity (r (2) > 0.991), run-to-run and day-to-day precisions (relative standard deviation (RSD) values lower than 9.9 and 13.5 %, respectively), and accuracy (relative errors lower than 8 %) were established. A simple extraction method, consisting of a sample sonication with acetone/water/hydrochloric acid (70:29.9:0.1 v/v/v) and centrifugation, was proposed. Two calibration procedures, external calibration using standards prepared in water and standard addition, were evaluated for polyphenol quantification in several grape and cranberry fruits and processed fruit products. For a 95 % confidence level, no statistical differences were observed between the two calibration methods (p values between 0.06 and 0.95), denoting that external calibration was suitable enough for the quantitative analysis of polyphenols in fruit-based products. The proposed LC-ESI-MS/MS method was then applied to the analysis of polyphenols in 23 grape-based and cranberry-based natural products and pharmaceutical preparations.

25356846,"To explore the effect of tannin composition on pigment formation, model ferments of purified 3-O-monoglucoside anthocyanins (ACN) were conducted either alone or in the presence of two different tannins. Tannins were isolated from grape seeds (Sd) or skins (Sk) following exhaustive extraction in 70% v/v acetone. The Sd and Sk tannin fractions had a mean degree of polymerization of 5.2 and 25.6, respectively. The Sd fraction was highly galloylated, at 22%, but galloylation was <2% in the Sk fraction. The Sk fraction was distinguished by a high proportion of prodelphinidin, at 58%. After a 6 month aging period, polymeric pigments were quantified and their color properties determined following isolation by solid-phase extraction. Wine color and polymeric pigment were highest in the treatment containing ACN+Sd and similar in the ACN+Sk and ACN treatments. The same trend between treatments was observed for total and polymeric nonbleachable pigments. Only minor changes in tannin subunit composition were found following ACN incorporation, but the size distribution of polymeric pigments determined by gel permeation chromatography decreased, in particular for the ACN+Sk treatment. Color incorporation in the higher molecular mass range was lower for ACN+Sk wines than for ACN+Sd wines. Compositional differences between the two tannin fractions may therefore limit the incorporation of ACNs in the colored form. The results suggest that in the ACN+Sk and ACN treatments, the formation of lower molecular mass oligomeric pigments was favored. In polymeric pigments derived from ACNs, the presence of ethyl- and vinyl-linked ACNs to the level of trimers was identified using mass spectrometry.

Metabolite profiles were obtained using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance and the oenological parameters were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Our results revealed that the amino acids threonine and serine were the most consumed organic nitrogen sources, while proline and gamma-aminobutyric acid were the least consumed amino acids during SB juice fermentation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolised some uncommon nitrogen sources (e.g. norleucine, norvaline and pyroglutamic acid) and several organic acids, including some fatty acids, most likely after fermenting the main juice sugars (glucose, fructose and mannose). However, consumption showed large variation between juices and in some cases between seasons. Our study clearly shows that preferred nitrogen and carbon sources were consumed by S. cerevisiae EC1118 independent of the juice fine composition, whilst the consumption of other nutrient sources mainly depended on the concentration of other juice metabolites, which explains the uniqueness of each barrel of wine.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism related to this treatment, the effect of SA treatment on fruit quality as well as protein expression profiles of grape berries (Vitis labruscana cv.

As expected, SA treatment inhibited postharvest loss and chilling damage by reducing fruit softening and membrane damage and slowing weight loss. A gel-based proteomic approach was designed to screen for differentially expressed proteins in SA-treated and control grape berries. A total of 69 differentially accumulated proteins were successfully identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, which can be functionally classified into eight categories. Among these proteins, antioxidant enzymes including ascorbate peroxidase, oxidoreductase, and glutathione S-transferase were induced, and the abundances of several defense-related proteins, such as heat shock protein (HSP) and temperature-induced lipocalin, were up-regulated by SA treatment. In addition, proteins involved in carbohydrate catabolism and energy production were also induced by SA treatment. Interpretation of the data for differential accumulation of proteins revealed that the effect of SA on reducing postharvest losses and chilling damage of grape berries during cold storage may be due to activated defense responses and carbohydrate metabolism and higher levels of energy status.

25191749,"Diet is one of the main factors that could affect quantitatively and qualitatively the stability of the gut microbiota. Polyphenols are abundantly present in the human diet and have an antimicrobial effect inducing selective changes in the microbiota composition, with potential beneficial effects for the human health. Our aim was to determine the human gut microbiota susceptibility toward wine polyphenols. Susceptibility to two commercial wine phenolic extracts (Vitaflavan(®) and Provinols™) was determined in isolates from fecal samples from 36 gastrointestinal healthy volunteers. To select the polyphenol-resistant isolates, feces were seeded in plates containing 1 mg/ml of phenolic extract. The minimal inhibitory concentration to polyphenols in the collected isolates was assessed by the agar dilution method. Overall results showed that Gram-negative isolates are most tolerant to the presence of both grape seed and red wine extracts. Furthermore, we purified to homogeneity the phenolic fractions by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine their antimicrobial effect and their influence on bacterial growth in four selected ATCC strains using the BioScreen apparatus. Results showed that the antimicrobial activity of the wine polyphenols is the result of the interaction of both the flavan-3-ol type and the bacteria.

Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most prominent mycotoxins found in agricultural commodities. The present work reports on the ability of Pediococcus parvulus strains that were isolated from Douro wines that spontaneously underwent malolactic fermentation to detoxify OTA. These strains were identified and characterised using a polyphasic approach that employed both phenotypic and genotypic methods. When cultivated on OTA-supplemented MRS media, OTA was biodegraded into OTα by certain P. parvulus strains. The presence of OTα was confirmed using LC-MS/MS. The conversion of OTA into OTα indicates that the OTA amide bond was hydrolysed by a putative peptidase. The rate of OTA biodegradation was found to be dependent on the inoculum size and on the incubation temperature. Adsorption assays with dead P. parvulus cells showed that approximately 1.3%±1.0 of the OTA was adsorbed onto cells wall, which excludes this mechanism in the elimination of OTA by strains that degrades OTA. Under optimum conditions, 50% and 90% of OTA were degraded in 6 and 19h, respectively. Other LAB strains that belonged to different species were tested but did not degrade OTA. OTA biodegradation by P. parvulus UTAD 473 was observed in grape must. Because some P. parvulus strains have relevant probiotic properties, the strains that were identified could be particularly relevant to food and feed applications to counteract the toxic effects of OTA.

The determination of the triterpenoid profile of cuticular waxes reported here supplements existing knowledge of the chemical diversity of grape, with some compounds reported in this species for the first time. Common compounds identified in eight examined cultivars grown in the Upper Rhine Valley include oleanolic acid, oleanolic and ursolic acid methyl esters, oleanolic aldehyde, α-amyrin, α-amyrenone, β-amyrin, cycloartanol, 24-methylenecycloartanol, erythrodiol, germanicol, lupeol accompanied by lupeol acetate, campesterol, cholesterol, sitosterol, stigmasterol, and stigmasta-3,5-dien-7-one, whereas 3,12-oleandione was specific for the Muscat d'Alsace cultivar. Changes in the triterpenoid content of cuticular waxes were determined at three different phenological stages: young grapes, grapes at véraison (the onset of ripening), and mature grapes. The results reveal a characteristic evolution of triterpenoid content during fruit development, with a high level of total triterpenoids in young grapes that gradually decreases with a slight increase in the level of neutral triterpenoids. This phenomenon may partially explain changes in the mechanical properties of the cuticle and possible modulations in the susceptibility to pathogens of mature grapes.

24945907,"A new method was developed and validated for the determination of multi-class pesticide residues in nutraceutical products obtained from grape seed extracts. The extraction procedure was based on QuEChERS methodology using ethyl acetate as solvent and a dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE) clean-up stage with C18 was included to minimise matrix effects. Pesticides determination was achieved using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS); total running time was 11 min. Pesticides were quantified using matrix-matched calibration. The developed method was validated in terms of matrix effect, linearity, selectivity, limits of detection and quantification, trueness, repeatability and inter-day precision at three concentration levels (10, 50, 100 µg kg(-1)). Suitable recovery values were obtained for 76% of analysed pesticides at the lowest concentration (10 µg kg(-1)). For most of the compounds, relative standard deviation values were lower than 20% and 25% for intra- and inter-day precision, respectively. Finally, 106 pesticides were determined, and the method was applied to seven dietary supplements from grape seed extract, obtaining various positive results for piperonyl butoxide, cyromazine and diniconazole at concentrations ranging from 2.0 to 13.4 µg kg(-1).","Food additives & contaminants.

The eight strains were members of different genera originally isolated from grape: Hansensiaspora osmophila, Lachancea thermotolerans, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Pichia fermentans, Saccharomycodes ludwigii, Starmerella bacillaris, Torulaspora delbrueckii and Zygosaccharomyces florentinus. A synthetic polysaccharide-free grape juice, was used to characterize the mannoproteins released during the alcoholic fermentation. Mannoproteins profiles were characterized by gel electrophoresis and carbohydrate composition was analyzed both by HPLC and by mass spectrometry. The eight non-Saccharomyces yeasts demonstrated a higher capacity to release polysaccharides compared to S. cerevisiae. The proteins released by the eight yeast strains showed a wide variety of protein sizes, ranging from 25 kDa to greater than 250 kDa. The mass spectrometric profile of the N-glycans ranged from 1600 to 4000 Da and was characteristic for each strain. Detailed investigation of the degree of polymerization of released N-glycans revealed variable composition from 8 to 15 units of monosaccharides.

24915378,"This review discusses the factors that affect the concentrations of methoxypyrazines (MPs) and the techniques used to analyze MPs in grapes, musts, and wines. MPs are commonly studied pyrazines in food science due to their contribution of aroma and flavor to numerous vegetables such as peas and asparagus. They are described as highly odorous compounds with a very low olfactory threshold. The grape varietals that exhibit green or herbaceous aromas that are characteristic of MPs are predominantly Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc, but include others. The most extensively studied MPs include 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine, 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine, and 3-sec-butyl-2-methoxypyrazine. It outlines the significance of methoxypyrazines in grapes, musts, and wines in terms of the concentrations that are capable of contributing their sensory characteristics to wines. This review discusses methods for analyzing MPs including gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (one or two dimension) and high-performance liquid chromatography, the appropriate extraction techniques, and the efficacy of these methods. Additionally, this review explores factors that affect pyrazine content of grapes, must, and wines, such as the effects of different viticultural practices, effects of light exposure and grape maturation, climate, soil, the multi-colored Asian lady beetle and the effects of different vinification processes.

24912722,"Grape flavonols are involved in the phenomenon of copigmentation in red wines. These compounds are characterised by nutraceutical properties, have antioxidant activity and are studied for chemotaxonomy of grapes. In general, hybrid grapes are characterised by presence of polyphenols often qualitatively and quantitatively different from Vitis vinifera varieties. In this work, flavonols of 34 hybrid grape varieties (22 red and 12 white) produced by crossing of V. vinifera, Vitis riparia, Vitis labrusca, Vitis lincecumii and Vitis rupestris species, were studied. Compounds were characterised by combining different liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) methods: precursor-ion and neutral-loss multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM), and high-resolution mass spectrometry.

The nitrogen sources applied to Tempranillo grapevines were proline, phenylalanine, urea, and two commercial nitrogen fertilisers, both without and with amino acids in their formulations. All treatments were applied at veraison and one week later. Proline treatment did not affect the must nitrogen composition. However, phenylalanine and urea foliar application enhanced the plants' synthesis of most of the amino acids, producing similar effects. In addition, the spray of commercial nitrogen fertilisers over leaves also induced a rise in grape amino acid concentrations regardless of the presence or absence of amino acids in their formulation.

24880552,"Anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) is an NADPH-/NADH-dependent enzyme that transfers two hydrides to anthocyanidins to produce three types of isomeric flavan-3-ols. This reductase forms the ANR pathway toward the biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins (PAs, which are also called condensed tannins). Here, we report cloning and functional characterization of an ANR (called VbANR) homolog from the leaves of Vitis bellula, a newly developed grape crop in southern China. The open reading frame (ORF) of VbANR is 1,017 bp in length and encodes 339 amino acids. A phylogenetic analysis and an alignment using 17 sequences revealed that VbANR is approximately 99.9 % identical to the ANR homolog from Vitis vinifera. The VbANR ORF is fused to the Trx gene containing a His-tag in the pET32a(+) vector to obtain a pET32a(+)-VbANR construct for expressing the recombinant VbANR. In vitro enzyme assays show that VbANR converts cyanidin, delphinidin, and pelargonidin to their corresponding flavan-3-ols. Enzymatic products include 2S,3R-trans- and 2R,3R-cis-flavan-3-ols isomers, such as (-)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. In addition, the third compound that is observed from the enzymatic products is most likely a 2S,3S-cis-flavan-3-ol. To analyze the kinetics and optimize pH and temperature values, a UV spectrometry method was developed to quantify the concentrations of total enzymatic products. The optimum pH and temperature values are 4.0 and 40 °C, respectively. The K m , K cat, V max, and K cat/K m values for pelargonidin and delphinidin were similar. In comparison, VbANR exhibits a slightly lower affinity to cyanidin. VbANR uses both NADPH and NADH but prefers to employ NADPH. GFP fusion and confocal microscopy analyses revealed the cytosolic localization of VbANR. The overexpression of VbANR in ban mutants reconstructed the biosynthetic pathway of PAs in the seed coat. These data demonstrate that VbANR forms the ANR pathway, leading to the formation of three types of isomeric flavan-3-ols and PAs in the leaves of V. bellula.",Planta,"['D000872', 'D003001', 'D006863', 'D009247', 'D010940', 'D027843']","['Anthocyanins', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases', 'Plant Proteins', 'Vitis']",Molecular cloning and functional characterization of the anthocyanidin reductase gene from Vitis bellula.,"['Q000378', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000201']","['metabolism', 'methods', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24880552,2015

24857316,"Pinking is the terminology used for the salmon-red blush color that may appear in white wines produced exclusively from white grape varieties. The isolation of pinking compounds and their analysis by RP-HPLC-DAD and ESI-MS(n) showed that the origin of the pinking phenomenon in white wines from Vitis vinifera L. of Sı́ria grape variety are the anthocyanins, mainly malvidin-3-O-glucoside. The analysis showed that the anthocyanins were located both in the pulp and in the skin. Wine pinking severity was negatively related with the increase of the average temperature of the first 10 days of October, the final period of grape maturation. The minimum amount of anthocyanins needed for the pink color visualization in wine was 0.3 mg/L. The appearance of pinking in white wines after bottling is due to the lowering of free sulfur dioxide, which leads to an increase of the relative amount of the anthocyanins red flavylium form and their polymerization, resulting in the formation of colored compounds resistant to pH changes and sulfur dioxide bleaching.

24783548,"A novel spectral fingerprint to discriminate different dry red wines was built using data visualization method. Twelve red wines with different vintages, cultivars and ageing methods from Changli and Shacheng were sampled. Nine fractions of each wine were collected with a reversed-phase C18 column, and then they were lyophilized. The residue of each fraction was resolved with synthetic wine of the same volume with the fraction sample. The transmittance spectra of wines and their fractions were recorded from 190 to 1100 nm. And the spectral data were visualized to show their visual differences directly. Mono-phenols in wine and fractions were analyzed by HPLC-DAD at wavelengths in the range where located the obvious differences of the spectral fingerprints. The results showed that the spectral differences of wine samples lied in the range of 190 to 600 nm. There were obvious differences in visual maps among wines with different vintages, mainly around 520 nm. The visualization differences among wines with distinct geographical origins lay in the F8 maps, and the differences from the aging methods almost cover the whole wavelength range visualized. However, wines from different grape cultivars had the similar visual characteristics. HPLC-DAD identified the possible monophenol groups for the spectral differences at 280, 313, 365 and 520 nm.

This study was to investigate the protective effects of grape seed pro-anthocyanidins (GSPs), an efficient antioxidant and anti-carcinogenic agent, on RILI. In our study, it was demonstrated that acute and late RILI was ameliorated after GSPs treatment possibly through suppressing TGF-β1/Smad3/Snail signalling pathway and modulating the levels of cytokines (interferon-γ, IL-4 and IL-13) derived from Th1/Th2 cells. In addition, a sustained high level of PGE2 was also maintained by GSPs treatment to limited fibroblast functions. As shown by electron spin resonance spectrometry, GSPs could scavenge hydroxyl radical (•OH) in a dose-dependent manner, which might account for the mitigation of lipid peroxidation and consequent apoptosis of lung cells. In vitro, GSPs radiosensitized lung cancer cell A549 while mitigating radiation injury on normal alveolar epithelial cell RLE-6TN. In conclusion, the results showed that GSPs protects mice from RILI through scavenging free radicals and modulating RILI-associated cytokines, suggesting GSPs as a novel protective agent in RILI.

24617307,"The influence of the fermentative addition of Pedro Ximenez grape pomace (PXGP, white variety) on the phenolic composition and color of Syrah red wines from a warm climate was studied. Changes on phenolic composition (HPLC), copigmentation/polymerization (spectrophotometry), and color (tristimulus colorimetry) allowed differences among the maceration treatments to be established. PXGP additions at the rates studied increased the extraction of total phenolics, phenolic acids, and monomeric flavanols. However, the effect on the anthocyanins, copigmentation, and polymerization depended on the doses applied, with important consequences on the color. PXGP addition at 10% led to wines with higher polymerization, more stable colors, and bluish hues. in contrast, perceptibly lighter and less intense wines were obtained with PXGP addition at 20%. Thus, the use of white grape byproducts as wine additives at appropriate levels (10% w/w) could improve the phenolic potential of red young wines from a warm climate, contributing to preserve their color characteristic.

Vine vigours were determined by plant cell density (PCD) obtained from aerial photography. As vine vigour decreased, total soluble solid in grapes, total phenolics and anthocyanins in wines increased, while titratable acidity and yield decreased. Wines from the ultra low vine vigour zone had the highest concentrations of esters and alcohols. Higher level of linalool, nerol, geraniol, vitispirane, and β-ionone were observed in ultra low vigour and low vigour zones, but there was no obvious trend for citronellol and β-damascenone.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a versatile and selective GC/MS/MS method for metabolite profiling of volatile compounds in apples, raspberries and grapes. Validation of the method was performed in terms of the limit of detection, limit of quantification, linearity range, and inter and intraday precision. Confirmation of the identity of the compounds in samples was carried out by checking compliance of the q/Q ratio of samples and reference standards. The multiple reaction monitoring with selection of two transition ions, one for quantification and one for confirmation, provided excellent selectivity and sensitivity, using the q/Q ratio as a confirmatory parameter. A multi target method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 160 volatile compounds of raspberries, apples and grapes. The main classes were esters (42), alcohols (32), monoterpenes (31), aldehydes (17), ketones (12), norisoprenoids (8), acids (8), sesquiterpenes (7), pyrazines (3) and ethers (1) allowing the detection and quantification of 69 compounds in apples, 122 in grapes and 42 in raspberries.

Quantitative RT-PCR validated microarrays results being carried out for EL 35 (véraison berries), EL 36 (ripe berries) and EL 38 (harvest stage berries). Metabolic profiling using HPLC and (1)H NMR spectroscopy showed increase of putrescine, proline, threonine and 1-O-ethyl-β-glucoside in guazatine treated samples. Genes involved in amino acid, carbohydrate and water transport were down-regulated in guazatine treated samples suggesting that the strong dehydrated phenotype obtained in guazatine treated samples may be due to impaired transport mechanisms.

24282955,"A simple and effective anion ion chromatography (IC) method with anion exchange column and conductivity detector has been developed to determine free sulfites (SO3-2) in dried fruits processed with sulfur dioxide. No oxidation agent, such as hydrogen peroxide, is used to convert sulfites to sulfates for IC analysis. In addition, no stabilizing agent, such as formaldehyde, fructose or EDTA, is required during the sample extraction. This method uses aqueous 0.2 N NaOH as the solvent for standard preparation and sample extraction. The sulfites, either prepared from standard sodium sulfite powder or extracted from food samples, are presumed to be unbound SO3-2 in aqueous 0.2 N NaOH (pH > 13), because the bound sulfites in the sample matrix are released at pH > 10. In this study, sulfites in the standard solutions were stable at room temperature (i.e., 15-25 degrees C) for up to 12 days. The lowest standard of the linear calibration curve is set at 1.59 microg/mL SO3-2 (equivalent to 6.36 microg/g sample with no dilution) for analysis of processed dried fruits that would contain high levels (>1000 microg/g) of sulfites. As a consequence, this method typically requires significant dilution of the sample extract. Samples are prepared with a simple procedure of sample compositing, extraction with aqueous 0.2 N NaOH, centrifugation, dilution as needed, and filtration prior to IC. The sulfites in these sample extracts are stable at room temperature for up to 20 h. Using anion IC, the sulfites are eluted under isocratic conditions with 10 mM aqueous sodium carbonate solution as the mobile phase passing through an anion exchange column. The sulfites are easily separated, with an analysis run time of 18 min, regardless of the dried fruit matrix. Recoveries from samples spiked with sodium sulfites were demonstrated to be between 81 and 105% for five different fruit matrixes (apricot, golden grape, white peach, fig, and mango).

All three proanthocyanidin-rich extracts induced a remarkable decrease in the de novo lipid synthesis in HepG2 cells. Moreover, GSPE rat serum metabolites reduced the total percentage of CE, FC and particularly TG; this reduction was significantly higher than that observed in the cells directly treated with GSPE.

24200641,"Phytohormones play important roles in regulating numerous plant physiological and developmental processes, even during the postharvest storage period. In order to determine the functions and changes of gibberellins acid (GA3), indoleacetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), indolebutyric acid (IBA) and jasmonic acid (JA) in grape berries during storage, an ultrasensitive method based on direct injection online solid-phase extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed. Grape berries were extracted with cold methanol. After centrifugation, the supernatants were concentrated with a vacuum centrifugal concentrator and injected into an online solid-phase extraction column. After the cleanup procedure, the analytes were determined by LC-MS/MS. The results showed that the linearity of the proposed method was 10-210 µg kg(-1) for ABA, 20-200 µg kg(-1) for IBA, 15-320 µg kg(-1) for IAA, 20-320 µg kg(-1) for GA3 and 3.0-90.0 µg kg(-1) for JA. The limits of detection of the method were 0.71, 2.79, 0.94, 0.39 and 0.57 µg kg(-1), respectively.

The 3,5-O-diglucoside anthocyanins and their acylated derivatives were monitored as signature compounds of non-V. vinifera grapes, using both reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). One variety (i.e. Tenta) was demonstrated to be an interspecific hybrid cross. Three additional varieties, namely Lacrima Nera, Aglianicone and a yet-unnamed variety, were classified as ""late generation hybrids"" (or non-V. vinifera×V. vinifera hybrids) because of a very diluted hybrid character, that was revealed only by MS methods. Five cultivars, i.e. Aglianico Lasco, Cannella, Coda di Volpe Rossa, Mentuonico, Olivella Nera, were catalogued as purebred V. vinifera.

24161146,"In multiresidue analysis, as the complexity of matrix increases, matrix co-extractives might co-elute and interfere with the detection of target analytes, and thereby result in false positives and erroneous quantifications. This paper aims to evaluate the combination of enhanced mass resolution and concurrent selectivity and sensitivity in analyzing a complex mixture of 341 pesticides in grape, orange, tomato, okra and spinach by gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Timed-selective reaction monitoring (t-SRM) was found advantageous over segment SRM in terms of ease of method optimization and sensitivity. The optimized t-SRM method was used to test the applicability of ultra-SRM (USRM) in filtering out co-eluting interfering matrix compounds. False detections of benfluralin, dimethoate, etc. could be avoided when mass resolution was increased from 0.7 to 0.4 and 0.2Da (full width at half maximum). Similar observations were noted for chlorobenzilate, spiromesifen, tebuconazole, etc., in grape; omethoate, bendiocarb, monocrotophos, etc. in orange; omethoate, dimethoate, ethoxyquin, atrazine, etc., in tomato; and dichlobenil, omethoate, propoxur, monocrotophos, etc., in okra. The analysis at higher mass resolution could significantly minimize matrix effects (ME), e.g., 34% at 0.7Da for spiroxamine in grape to 0.6% (0.4Da) and -44% (0.7Da) for dichlorvos in okra to 8.8% (0.1Da). A feature called ""quantitation enhanced data-dependent (QED) scan feature"" was found effective in targeted screening to confirm the detection of atrazine, azoxystrobin, λ-cyhalothrin, etc. at trace quantities in incurred samples and avoid false detection of chlorpyrifos.

Of the 43 yeast isolates examined, 33 were attractive and seven repellent to the flies. The results of isolate-versus-isolate comparisons provided the same relative rankings. Attractiveness varied significantly by yeast, with the strongly fermenting Saccharomyces species generally being more attractive than the mostly respiring non-Saccharomyces species (P = 0.0035). Overall the habitat (fruit or other) from which the isolates were directly sampled did not explain attraction (P = 0.2352). However, yeasts isolated from fruit associated niches were more attractive than those from non-fruit associated niches (P = 0.0188) regardless of taxonomic positioning. These data suggest that while attractiveness is primarily correlated with phylogenetic status, the ability to attract Drosophila is a labile trait among yeasts that is potentially associated with those inhabiting fruit ecosystems. Preliminary analysis of the volatiles emitted by four yeast isolates in grape juice show the presence/absence of ethanol and acetic acid were not likely explanations for the observed variation in attraction. These data demonstrate variation among yeasts for their ability to attract Drosophila in a pattern that is consistent with the hypothesis that certain yeasts are manipulating fruit odours to mediate interactions with their Drosophila dispersal agent.

24084717,"Grape is qualitatively and quantitatively very rich in polyphenols. In particular, anthocyanins, flavonols and stilbene derivatives play very important roles in plant metabolism, thanks to their peculiar characteristics. Anthocyanins are responsible for the color of red grapes and wines and confer organoleptic characteristics on the wine. They are used for chemotaxonomic studies and to evaluate the polyphenolic ripening stage of grape. They are natural colorants, have antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic activity, exert protective effects on the human cardiovascular system, and are used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Stilbenes are vine phytoalexins present in grape berries and associated with the beneficial effects of drinking wine. The principal stilbene, resveratrol, is characterized by anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective activity. Resveratrol dimers and oligomers also occur in grape, and are synthetized by the vine as active defenses against exogenous attack, or produced by extracellular enzymes released from pathogens in an attempt to eliminate undesirable toxic compounds. Flavonols are a ubiquitous class of flavonoids with photo-protection and copigmentation (together with anthocyanins) functions. The lack of expression of the enzyme flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase in white grapes restricts the presence of these compounds to quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin derivatives, whereas red grapes usually also contain myricetin, laricitrin and syringetin derivatives. In the last ten years, the technological development of analytical instrumentation, particularly mass spectrometry, has led to great improvements and further knowledge of the chemistry of these compounds. In this review, the biosynthesis and biological role of these grape polyphenols are briefly introduced, together with the latest knowledge of their chemistry.

As a potential feasible means of evaluation in situ, blood serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were evaluated as a marker for heart damage from acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Twenty rats were divided into four groups, two of them being irradiated by gamma-rays from a Co-60 source. Animals were treated by gavage with 2 mL per day of BGJ or placebo for one week before and 4 days after 6 Gy whole body gamma-irradiation, when they were euthanasiated. LDH on serum and lipid peroxidation on heart tissue were evaluated. High concentration of metabolites from lipid peroxidation in heart, and high LDH level on serum were found only in gamma-irradiated group given placebo, mainly at the first 24 h after radiation. Phytochemical analysis of BGJ was performed by determining total phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins followed by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/DAD) analysis, which showed resveratrol as the major constituent. Results suggest that BGJ is a good protective candidate compound against heart damage from ARS and its effects suggest its use as a radiomodifier.

By Head Space-Solid Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Electron Impact Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-EIMS) analysis, 10 VOCs were identified at all developmental stages: four monoterpenes, three aldehydes, two alcohols and one ketone. Monoterpenes increased at pre-harvest and in response to UV-B in both, in vitro and field conditions. UV-B also augmented levels of some aldehydes, alcohols and ketones. These results along with others from the literature suggest that UV-B induce grape berries to produce VOCs (mainly monoterpenes) that protect the tissues from UV-B itself and other abiotic and biotic stresses, and could affect the wine flavor.

In the fruit of Vitis vinifera L., the five main anthocyanidins (cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin) are present as 3-O-glucosides, as well as their acetyl, p-coumaroyl and caffeoyl ester forms. Despite the huge number of experimental studies dedicated to the anthocyanin profile analysis of grapes and wines, the complete theoretical elucidation of the optical properties of grape anthocyanins is missing. The present work carried out this task through quantum chemistry calculations based on time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), compared to experimental spectra. The differences in visible absorption spectra between the most common grape anthocyanins were rationalized according to B-ring substitution, glucosylation and esterification.

This is due to challenges associated with the accurate analytical determination of the highly structurally diverse proanthocyanidins which comprise tannins. In this contribution, we address this limitation by demonstrating how online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) can be exploited as a powerful analytical approach for the detailed characterization of grape seed tannins. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) were employed in the two dimensions to provide complementary information in terms of separation according to hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, respectively. Online coupling of HILIC × RP-LC with fluorescence detection and electrospray ionization MS delivered high resolution analysis in a practical analysis time, while allowing selective detection and facilitating compound identification. Time-of-flight (TOF) MS provided high acquisition rates and sensitivity coupled to accurate mass information, which allowed detection of procyanidins up to a degree of polymerization (DP) of 16 and a degree of galloylation up to 8 in a red grape seed extract.

There is an increasing interest in this class of terpenoids, since the oxygenated sesquiterpene rotundone was identified as the peppery aroma impact compound in Australian Shiraz wines. To investigate precursor supply pathway utilization, in vivo feeding experiments were performed with the deuterium labeled, pathway specific, precursors [5,5-(2)H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose and [5,5-(2)H2]-mevalonic acid lactone. Head Space-Solid Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) analysis of the generated volatile metabolites demonstrated that de novo sesquiterpene biosynthesis is mainly located in the grape berry exocarp (skin), with no detectable activity in the mesocarp (flesh) of the Lemberger variety. Interestingly, precursors from both the (primarily) cytosolic MVA and plastidial DOXP/MEP pathways were incorporated into grape sesquiterpenes in the varieties Lemberger, Gewürztraminer and Syrah. Our labeling data provide evidence for a homogenous, cytosolic pool of precursors for sesquiterpene biosynthesis, indicating that a transport of precursors occurs mostly from plastids to the cytosol. The labeling patterns of the sesquiterpene germacrene D were in agreement with a cyclization mechanism analogous to that of a previously cloned enantioselective (R)-germacrene D synthase from Solidago canadensis.

It has been shown earlier that P. nordicum is adapted to NaCl rich environments like salt rich dry cured foods or even salines. In this organism, the biosynthesis of ochratoxin A plays an adaptive role in this habitat. P. verrucosum generally can be found on cereals, but occasionally also on salt rich dry cured foods. In contrast A. carbonarius usually cannot be found in NaCl rich environments, but it occurs in another environment with high concentration of solutes, e.g., in sugar rich substrates like grapes and grape juices. Usually osmotic challenging conditions activate the HOG MAP kinase signal cascade, which in turn activates various osmo-regulated genes. In the current analysis, it could be demonstrated that in case of P. nordicum and P. verrucosum the NaCl induced production of ochratoxin A is correlated to the phosphorylation status of the HOG MAP kinase. Just the opposite was true for A. carbonarius. In this case, also higher amounts of NaCl in the medium lead to an increased phosphorylation status of HOG, but no increase in ochratoxin biosynthesis was observed. In contrast to the Penicillia, higher NaCl concentrations lead to a rapid cessation of growth by A. carbonarius.

In general, most of the phenolic compounds determined (anthocyanins, flavonols, esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, flavan-3-ol monomers and proanthocyanidins) increase but to a lesser extent than expected because of the water loss of the grapes during drying.

Optimisation of an analytical procedure for the separation of Sr from its interferences and investigation of the analytical performances in terms of precision of used methodology have been carried out as well.

The energies of the minimized geometries for all four conformations of this compound were calculated and comparing the structures of all isomers, it was verified that the binding mode (α or β) between the first and second anthocyanin unit does not have a key role in the compound stability. However, for isomers 1 and 2 where the interaction between the second and third anthocyanin units occurs by a ""β"" mode in opposition to the ""α"" mode verified in isomers 3 and 4, revealed a higher stability.

The results obtained indicate that crystalline components can be correlated to the metabolites contained in the grape leaves, paving the way to the use of X-ray diffraction analysis for food fingerprinting purposes. Moreover it was ascertained that, differently from most of the metabolites present in the fresh vine leaves, linolenic acid (an omega-3-fatty acid) and quercetin-3-O-glucuronide (a polyphenol metabolite) do not undergo sensible degradation during the brining process, which is used as preservative method for the grape leaves.

The method employs hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) using electrospray ionisation in the negative mode and ultraviolet light detection. Different fruit juices can be differentiated by the content of marker compounds like sorbitol, certain phenolic molecules and their saccharide profile. This method was used to test 46 fruit juice samples from the retail market as well as 12 control samples. The study focused on the main types of fruit juices consumed on the South African market including apple, orange, grape and blends of these juices with other fruits like mango, pear and guava. Overall, the 46 samples tested mostly agreed with label claims. One grape juice sample was adulterated, probably with apple juice. Natamycin above the legal limits was found in two samples. In addition, two samples contained natamycin and one sample benzoate without it being indicated on the label. The method is well suited as a quick screening method for fruit juice adulteration and if used routinely would reduce fruit juice adulteration without the cost of the current array of tests needed for authenticity testing.","Food additives & contaminants.

Each of the four B. subtilis strains enhanced the degradation of profenofos in all three matrices. Degradation rate constants were best obtained by first + first-order kinetics module. In nutrient broth spiked with 5 μg/mL profenofos, inoculation with B. subtilis strains DR-39, CS-126, TL-171, and TS-204 reduced the half-life (DT50) of profenofos to 4.03, 3.57, 2.87, and 2.53 days, respectively, from the DT50 = 12.90 days observed in the uninoculated control. In Thompson Seedless grapes sprayed with profenofos at a field dose of 1250 mL ai/ha, the DT50 values were 1.07, 1.00, 2.13, and 2.20 days in grapes inoculated with B. subtilis strains DR-39, CS-126, TL-171, and TS-204, respectively, as compared to 2.20 days in uninoculated grapes.

In field experiments, Suterra lures detected P. viteana most often, Trécé lures detected more E. argutanus, and ISCA lures detected P. viteana in the open vineyard the least, while Alpha Scents lures were least attractive to E. argutanus in both environments. Fewer P. viteana were captured in the wooded versus open vineyard, which may limit the potential for sex pheromone monitoring of P. viteana in wooded vineyards.",Environmental entomology,"['D000383', 'D000818', 'D007851', 'D005229', 'D005260', 'D008401', 'D008297', 'D009036', 'D010572', 'D010675', 'D012621', 'D012724', 'D013045', 'D014768', 'D027843']","['Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Dodecanol', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated', 'Female', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Male', 'Moths', 'Pest Control, Biological', 'Pheromones', 'Seasons', 'Sex Attractants', 'Species Specificity', 'Virginia', 'Vitis']","Blend chemistry and field attraction of commercial sex pheromone lures to grape berry moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and a nontarget tortricid in vineyards.","[None, None, 'Q000031', 'Q000494', None, None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000379', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000494', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'pharmacology', None, None, None, 'physiology', 'methods', 'pharmacology', None, 'pharmacology', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23726065,2014
23701500,"Seventy wines were produced in Ecuador under different processing conditions with local fruits: Andean blackberries (Rubus glaucus Benth.) and blueberries (Vaccinium floribundum Kunth.) and Golden Reinette apples. Wines were evaluated for antioxidant activity (AA) using the radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) method, total phenolic content (TPC) using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, total monomeric anthocyanins (TMAs) using the pH differential test, and color parameters using VIS-spectrophotometry. For blackberry wines, ellagitannins and anthocyanins were also analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD). Apples wines (n = 40) had the lowest TPC (608 ± 86 mg/L) and AA (2.1 ± 0.3 mM Trolox). Blueberry wines (n = 12) had high TPC (1086 ± 194 mg/L) and moderate AA (5.4 ± 0.8 mM) but very low TMA (8 ± 3 mg/L), with a color evolved toward yellow and blue shades. Blackberry wines (n = 10) had the highest TPC (1265 ± 91 mg/L) and AA (12 ± 1 mM). Ellagitannins were the major phenolics (1172 ± 115 mg/L) and correlated well with AA (r = 0.88). Within anthocyanins (TMA 73 ± 16 mg/L), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (62%) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (15%) were predominant. Wines obtained by cofermentation of apples and blackberries (n = 8) showed intermediate characteristics (TPC 999 ± 83 mg/L, AA 6.2 ± 0.7 mM, TMA 35 ± 22 mg/L) between the blackberry and blueberry wines. The results suggest that the Andean berries, particularly R. glaucus, are suitable raw materials to produce wines with an in vitro antioxidant capacity that is comparable to red grape wines.

23697175,"An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the determination of hydroxycinnamoyltartaric esters, such as caftaric acid, p-coutaric acid and fertaric acid in grape juice, peel and seed. The target analytes were separated on a Waters UPLC HSS T3 column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 microm) at 35 degrees C with gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The grape juice was freeze-centrifuged, the supernatant was diluted with 20% methanol. The grape peel and grape seed samples were extracted with 80% ethanol. The extract was cleaned-up on-line with the analytical column by valve switching technology. The mobile phases were water-acetonitrile (both containing 0.1% formic acid). The identification and quantification were achieved by MS/MS in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode via negative electrospray ionization. As lack of commercial standards, p-coutaric acid and fertaric acid were quantified by caftaric acid equivalent. The developed method showed a good linearity over the range of 25-2 000 microg/L with good correlation coefficient (r2 = 0.998 9). The limit of detection was 0.25 microg/L, and the limit of quantification was 25 microg/L. The average recoveries of caftaric acid were between 97.7%-99.5% and the precisions were within 2.5% at the spiked levels of 250, 750 and 1 200 microg/L. The working solutions were stable for 74 h at room temperature. The results showed that there are significant differences of hydroxycinnamoyltartaric esters distribution in grape juice, peel and seeds.

23692760,"Consumer demand for pomegranate juice has considerably grown, during the last years, for its potential health benefits. Since it is an expensive functional food, cheaper fruit juices addition (i.e., grape and apple juices) or its simple dilution, or polyphenols subtraction are deceptively used. At present, time-consuming analyses are used to control the quality of this product. Furthermore these analyses are expensive and require well-trained analysts. Thus, the purpose of this study was to propose a high-speed and easy-to-use shortcut. Based on UV-VIS spectroscopy and chemometrics, a screening method is proposed to quickly screening some common fillers of pomegranate juice that could decrease the antiradical scavenging capacity of pure products. The analytical method was applied to laboratory prepared juices, to commercial juices and to representative experimental mixtures at different levels of water and filler juices. The outcomes were evaluated by means of multivariate exploratory analysis. The results indicate that the proposed strategy can be a useful screening tool to assess addition of filler juices and water to pomegranate juices.",Food chemistry,"['D001628', 'D055951', 'D029561', 'D015999', 'D011786', 'D013053', 'D013056']","['Beverages', 'Functional Food', 'Lythraceae', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Quality Control', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",A screening method based on UV-Visible spectroscopy and multivariate analysis to assess addition of filler juices and water to pomegranate juices.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23692760,2013

The berry skin and wine of grape cultivar Vitis vinifera L. (cv. Aglianico), grown in Basilicata (Southern Italy) were examined to determinate the presence of the above mentioned compounds as well as to establish the inorganic cation profile. HPLC analysis coupled with LC-ESI/MS/MS detected high contents of total flavonols and anthocyanins in berry skin and wine. The wine made with the same grape used for berry skin assays showed a notable presence of quercetin-3-O-glucoside (39.4% of total flavonols), and malvidin and petunidin derivatives (63.9% and 10.8% of total anthocyanins, respectively). The strong antioxidant ROS-scavenging activity, determined by both DPPH and FRAP assays, and the high resveratrol content confer high sensory characteristics resulted to be associated with positive nutraceutical properties of these grapes and wine. The level of cis-resveratrol was lower than trans-resveratrol in both berry skin and wine reaching 44.1mg/kg and 0.3mg/l, respectively.

23686585,"Melatonin (MT) presence in higher plants was recently discovered and the knowledge of its function in vivo is limited. Several studies have recently shown the occurrence of MT and related compounds in grapes and wines. The analysis of MT in plants and foods represents a highly challenging task due to its wide concentration range, the difficulty in the selection of the extraction solvents because of its amphipathic nature, and the fact that it reacts quickly with other matrix components. Thus, sample processing factors; preparation/cleanup procedures; and chromatographic/detection parameters, such as HILIC and reverse phase (C(8) and C(18)) chromatographic modes, ESI, and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in both negative and positive modes were evaluated. Taken together, we have demonstrated that optimal conditions were quite different for each of the matrices under study. A sonication-mediated extraction step was necessary for grape skin (100% v/v methanol) and plant tissues (50% v/v methanol), while wine and must required a SPE preconcentration step. HILIC-(+) APCI ionization was better for MT standards, while C(8) -(+) APCI was the best choice for grape skin and C(18) -(+ESI) was suitable for wine. On the other hand, C(8) -(+)ESI was the most appropriate for vegetal tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana. Proposed methods were validated and the LODs were in the low picogram levels range. The optimized approaches were applied to the determination of MT and its isomer in different vegetal/food samples; levels found within the range: 4.9-440 ng/g.",Electrophoresis,"['D000704', 'D017360', 'D002851', 'D007477', 'D016018', 'D057230', 'D008550', 'D035261', 'D015203', 'D021241', 'D053719', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Arabidopsis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ions', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Limit of Detection', 'Melatonin', 'Plant Components, Aerial', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Analytical tools for elucidating the biological role of melatonin in plants by LC-MS/MS.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686585,2014

To elucidate the mechanism of the differential color development, anatomical research was carried out and a cytological study of the colored protoplasts in which the shapes of the cells accumulating anthocyanin were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Next, vacuolar pH was recorded using a pH meter with a micro combination pH electrode, and the sap's metal-ion content was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The anthocyanin and co-pigment composition was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chemical analyses reveal that the difference in metal-ion content of the two parts was not great. The vacuolar pHs of the upper and lower flowers were 5.91 and 5.84, respectively, with the difference being nonsignificant. HPLC results indicate that the dihydroflavonol and flavonol contents are also very similar in the two sorts of flower. However, the upper flowers contained only delphinidin, whereas the lower flowers also contained cyanidin. The total anthocyanin content in the lower flowers was 4.36 mg g(-1), which is approximately seven times higher than in the upper flowers, while the delphinidin content is four times higher. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis established that the two-tone flower was a result of different expressions of the F3'5'H, F3'H and DFR genes, and these lead to different amounts of anthocyanin.

23578640,"The effects of three β-glucosidases (BG1, BG2 from Trichosporon asahii, AS from Aspergillus Niger) on the aroma profiles of Cabernet Gernischt (CG) were investigated, coupled with an exploration of the possible reasons for the different performances of β-glucosidases under the two different conditions (hydrolysis of grape glycoside extract and wine-making). The analysis of headspace solid-phase micro-extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that volatile flavour compounds in the β-glucosidase-treated samples were significantly increased. Specially, the wines treated with β-glucosidase BG1 occupied the highest concentrations of 19 out of 23 volatile compounds that exhibited significant differences. The investigation of the effects of pH or glucose on β-glucosidases showed that low pH is the main factor that exerts a more critical and irreversible influence on the activities and structures of β-glucosidase proteins. The stronger resistances to pH and glucose provided β-glucosidase BG1 a better ability in hydrolysing aromatic precursors than other enzymes under winemaking conditions. With the HPLC analysis, eight anthocyanins were identified from CG wine. Among the three β-glucosidases, BG1 showed the lowest influence on the main anthocyanin glycosides.

The present work represents the first study on sweet wines manufactured with red grapes Vitis vinifera L. Garnacha Tintorera, a teinturier cultivar. Two different red sweet wines were elaborated: the first one was made with dried grapes; Vitis vinifera L. Garnacha Tintorera has excellent potential to produce wines from raisined grapes; the second one, a fortified sweet wine aged in oak barrels. Different red Garnacha Tintorera-based wines (a dry base wine, GBW; a naturally sweet wine, GNSW; and a fortified sweet wine, GFSW) were characterized. Chromatic characteristics and phenolic compounds were established by spectrophotometric methods in order to assess the technology of Garnacha Tintorera-based sweet wines. High molecular weight brown polymers, produced during the grape drying process and isolated from sweet wines by the dialysis process, were responsible for the brown colour of sweet wines. As a consequence, yellowness of sweet wines was also higher which was confirmed by colorimetric indexes. With respect to phenolic content, GFSW presented the lowest content because the maceration-alcoholic fermentation was stopped through the addition of alcohol before the diffusion of red pigments from skins to must was complete. GNSW presented the highest phenolic content due to the concentration effect resulting from evaporation of water from the grapes. Anthocyanins of sweet wines were polymerised in great extent. The percentage of polymerised tannins was sufficient to guarantee the aging process of sweet wines.",Food chemistry,"['D000872', 'D005421', 'D010636', 'D013030', 'D013053', 'D013634', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Anthocyanins', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Phenols', 'Spain', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Tannins', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Garnacha Tintorera-based sweet wines: chromatic properties and global phenolic composition by means of UV-Vis spectrophotometry.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23578636,2013

On the basis of retention response to temperature, an alternative retention factor was developed to approximate the combined temperature response of the complex, unresolvable tannin mixture. This alternative retention factor was based upon relative tannin peak areas separated by an abrupt change in solvent gradient. Using this alternative retention factor, retention thermodynamics were calculated. Van't Hoff relationships of the natural log of the alternative retention factor against temperature followed Kirchoff's relationship. An inverse quadratic equation was fit to the data, and from this the thermodynamic parameters for tannin retention were calculated. All tannin fractions exhibited exothermic, spontaneous interaction, with enthalpy-entropy compensation observed. Normalizing for tannin size, distinct tannin compositional effects on thermodynamic parameters were observed.

23551038,"Phenolic extraction in hybrid and interspecific wine grape cultivars is poorly understood, especially in terms of the impact of fermentation and enological conditions on condensed tannins and anthocyanins. Following fractionation via solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography, phenolic profiles of must and wine from red hybrid grape cultivars Maréchal Foch, Corot noir, and Marquette were examined to assess the impact of enzyme and tannin addition, cold soak, and hot press during vinification. Across cultivars, hot press treatments resulted in the greatest extraction of condensed tannin, anthocyanin, and other monomeric phenolic compounds in musts, and treatments that increased skin contact time or cellular degradation during fermentation produced higher concentrations of tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonols. However, these increases were transient, evincing incomplete carryover into finished wines. Depending on initial must extraction, diglucoside forms of anthocyanins were either selectively extracted or selectively retained throughout fermentation when compared to their monoglucoside counterparts. Typical of hybrid grapes, tannin concentrations across cultivars were low, even under hot press conditions. For condensed tannins and anthocyanins, a cultivar-specific, stable-state concentration and phenolic profile emerged regardless of fermentation conditions. Due to the high levels of diglucoside anthocyanins and low levels of condensed tannins, it is expected that the color development and profile in these wines produced from hybrid grape cultivars will be dictated by the monomeric anthocyanins and their potential role in copigmentation processes involving other monomeric phenolic species, as opposed to the formation of polymeric color pigments.",Journal of food science,"['D000872', 'D002851', 'D005285', 'D044948', 'D005511', 'D005638', 'D010636', 'D044945', 'D052616', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fermentation', 'Flavonols', 'Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Phenols', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Vitis', 'Wine']","Impact of processing parameters on the phenolic profile of wines produced from hybrid red grapes Maréchal Foch, Corot noir, and Marquette.","['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23551038,2013

Nevertheless, these two species differ for many other traits, indicating that they underwent different evolutionary histories. To determine how the evolutionary histories of S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum are mirrored on the proteome, we analyzed the genetic variability of the proteomes of domesticated strains of these two species by quantitative mass spectrometry. Overall, 445 proteins were quantified. Massive variations of protein abundances were found, that clearly differentiated the two species. Abundance variations in specific metabolic pathways could be related to phenotypic traits known to discriminate the two species. In addition, proteins encoded by duplicated genes were shown to be differently recruited in each species. Comparing the strain differentiation based on the proteome variability to those based on the phenotypic and genetic variations further revealed that the strains of S. uvarum and some strains of S. cerevisiae displayed similar fermentative performances despite strong proteomic and genomic differences.

The extracts of banana, grape and tamarind are taken as the sources of tartaric acid. The as-synthesized samples were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). Also the antibacterial activity of HAP with different concentrations against two pathogen bacteria strains Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella (Gram-negative bacteria) were tested. The results show that the particles of all the samples are of nanosized and pure. The crystallinity decreases as changing the sources of tartaric acid from commercial to natural one and also changing the natural sources from banana to tamarind extracts. The formation of nanorods are found in all the samples but the nanorods with uniform size distribution can be obtained only by using the tamarind extract as the source of tartaric acid. Moreover, the as-synthesised HAP nanorods derived from natural sources exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against both E. coli and Klebsiella at a concentration of 100 μl.

23364938,"Changes in carbohydrate metabolism during grape berry development play a central role in shaping the final composition of the fruit. The present work aimed to identify metabolic switches during grape development and to provide insights into the timing of developmental regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. Metabolites from central carbon metabolism were measured using high-pressure anion-exchange chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays during the development of grape berries from either field-grown vines or fruiting cuttings grown in the greenhouse. Principal component analysis readily discriminated the various stages of berry development, with similar trajectories for field-grown and greenhouse samples. This showed that each stage of fruit development had a characteristic metabolic profile and provided compelling evidence that the fruit-bearing cuttings are a useful model system to investigate regulation of central carbon metabolism in grape berry. The metabolites measured showed tight coordination within their respective pathways, clustering into sugars and sugar-phosphate metabolism, glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition, there was a pronounced shift in metabolism around veraison, characterized by rapidly increasing sugar levels and decreasing organic acids. In contrast, glycolytic intermediates and sugar phosphates declined before veraison but remained fairly stable post-veraison. In summary, these detailed and comprehensive metabolite analyses revealed the timing of important switches in primary carbohydrate metabolism, which could be related to transcriptional and developmental changes within the berry to achieve an integrated understanding of grape berry development.

These compounds interact with proteins due to their numerous hydroxyl groups, which are suitable for hydrophobic associations. It was hypothesized that tannins could bind to the digestive enzymes α-amylase and glucoamylase, thereby inhibiting starch hydrolysis. Slowed starch digestion can theoretically increase satiety by modulating glucose ""spiking"" and depletion that occurs after carbohydrate-rich meals. Tannins were isolated from extracts of pomegranate, cranberry, grape, and cocoa and these isolates tested for effectiveness to inhibit the activity of α-amylase and glucoamylase in vitro. The compositions of the isolates were confirmed by NMR and LC/MS analysis, and tannin-protein interactions were investigated using relevant enzyme assays and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results demonstrated inhibition of each enzyme by each tannin, but with variation in magnitude.

Although the biosynthesis of PAs in berry of Vitis vinifera has gained intensive investigations, the understanding of PAs in other Vitis species is limited. In this study, we report PA formation and characterization of gene expression involved in PA biosynthesis in leaves of V. bellula, a wild edible grape species native to south and south-west China. Leaves are collected at five developmental stages defined by sizes ranging from 0.5 to 5 cm in length. Analyses of thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector (HPLC-PAD) show the formation of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin during the entire development of leaves. Analyses of butanol-HCl boiling cleavage coupled with spectrometry measurement at 550 nm show a temporal trend of extractable PA levels, which is characterized by an increase from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm long leaves followed by a decrease in late stages. TLC and HPLC-PAD analyses identify cyanidin, delphinidin and pelargonidin produced from the cleavage of PAs in the butanol-HCl boiling, showing that the foliage PAs of V. bellula include three different types of extension units. Four cDNAs, which encode VbANR, VbDFR, VbLAR1 and VbLAR2, respectively, are cloned from young leaves. The expression patterns of VbANR and VbLAR2 but not VbLAR1 and VbDFR follow a similar trend as the accumulation patterns of PAs. Two cDNAs encoding VbMYBPA1 and VbMYB5a, the homologs of which have been demonstrated to regulate the expression of both ANR and LAR in V. vinifera, are also cloned and their expression profiles are similar to those of VbANR and VbLAR2. In contrast, the expression profiles of MYBA1 and 2 homologs involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis are different from those of VbANR and VbLAR2.

Malvidin-3-0-glucoside (malvidin), an anthocyanidine belonging to polyphenols, is highly present in red grape skin and red wine. Its biological activity is poorly characterized, although a role in tumor cell inhibition has been found. To analyze whether and to which extent, like other food-derived polyphenols, malvidin affects the cardiovascular function, in this study, we have performed a quantitative analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography of polyphenolic content of red grape skins extract, showing that it contains a high malvidin amount (63.93 ±12.50 mg/g of fresh grape skin). By using the isolated and Langendorff perfused rat heart, we found that the increasing doses (1-1000 ng/ml) of the extract induced positive inotropic and negative lusitropic effects associated with coronary dilation. On the same cardiac preparations, we observed that malvidin (10(-10)-10(-6) mol/L) elicited negative inotropism and lusitropism and coronary dilation. Analysis of mechanism of action revealed that malvidin-dependent cardiac effects require the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP/PKG pathway and are associated with increased intracellular cGMP and the phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2, and GSK-3β. AKT and eNOS phosphorylation was confirmed in human umbilical vein endothelial cell. We also found that malvidin act as a postconditioning agent, being able to elicit cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion damages.

The headspace gas chromatographic method described in this study offers a fast and reliable alternative method for the detection and quantification of the sulfur dioxide content in wine.

The method is based on the formation of gaseous sulfur dioxide subsequent to acidification and heating of the sample. In addition to free sulfur dioxide, reversibly bound sulfur dioxide in carbonyl compounds, such as acetaldehyde, was also measured with this method.

For reference and comparison purposes, 10 of the results obtained by the proposed method were compared with those acquired by the optimised Monier-Williams method.

In this work, we measured melatonin, its isomers, stilbenes (trans- and cis-resveratrol and their glucosides, piceids) and total polyphenols in some different grape products (red, white and dessert wines, grape juices and Modena balsamic vinegars) of distinct Italian areas. We also evaluated their antiradical activity by DPPH(·) and ABTS(·+) assays. For indoleamine analysis, the separation was carried out on a 1.7-μm C18 BEH column and the detection performed by means of mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization in positive ion mode with multiple reaction monitoring. The confirmation of the peak identity was accomplished by injection into the high-resolution system (Orbitrap) using accurate mass measurements (error below 1.0 ppm).

23089514,"Resveratrol exerts a variety of biological and pharmacological activities, which are observed despite its extremely low bioavailability and rapid clearance from the circulation due to extensive sulfation and glucuronidation in the intestine and liver. In order to more accurately quantify all known resveratrol metabolites, a sensitive and optimized analytical assay was developed and validated by pure standards. Methodology improvements aimed to the chromatographic detection of disulfates and sulfoglucuronides, improving resolution of sulfates, by using a buffered solution, with recovery values of resveratrol and its metabolites, even of sulfates, of 99%. The adapted methodology was then applied to a clinical study with high cardiovascular risk subjects, after the moderate consumption of red wine (RW) or dealcoholized red wine (DRW) for 28 days. Up to 21 resveratrol metabolites, including those formed by gut and microbial metabolism, were identified in 24-h urine samples. Interestingly, after long-term consumption of RW and DRW, resveratrol metabolite concentration significantly increased in urine with no differences between the two interventions, indicating that bioavailability and biotransformation of resveratrol is not affected by the alcoholic matrix of wine. In summary, we established a sensitive analytical assay for the quantification of a wide resveratrol metabolic profile in human urine, also regarding gut microbial-derived metabolites, which may also be applied to blood and tissue samples. The resveratrol metabolic pattern might therefore act as an excellent marker for the efficacy of resveratrol in clinical and epidemiological studies for the study of the beneficial effects of grape product consumption.

(-)-Vitisin B is one of the resveratrol tetramers extracted from VTT. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of (-)-vitisin B on the induction of apoptosis in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. First, (-)-vitisin B significantly inhibited cell proliferation through inducing cell apoptosis. This effect appeared to occur in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell-cycle distribution was also examined, and we found that (-)-vitisin B significantly induced a sub-G1 population in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, (-)-vitisin B exhibited stronger inhibitory effects on cell proliferation than resveratrol. Second, (-)-vitisin B dose dependently induced apoptosis-related protein expressions, such as the cleavage form of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase, and the proapoptotic Bax protein. Third, (-)-vitisin B treatment also resulted in increases in c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and Fas ligand (FasL) expression. Moreover, the (-)-vitisin B-induced FasL expression and caspase-3 activation could be reversed by a JNK inhibitor.

The solution collected were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, and concentration of cations and anions. For each event, the ionic fluxes of bulk precipitation and throughfall were calculated. Results indicated that the chemical composition of the bulk precipitation was strongly influenced by the proximity of the seashore and, to a lesser extent, by local anthropic activities and windblown material coming from distant areas. The chemical composition of the throughfall was affected by the same factors of bulk precipitation, but also by solubilisation of dry deposition trapped by the canopies, agronomic practices, plant, and living-on-the-leaves microorganisms. The comparison of the characteristics of the throughfall of the real with the artificial vines revealed that the vines are a source of Mg and K. During winter season, the reduction of Ca, NH(4) and PO(4) from bulk precipitation to throughfall was ascribed to the formation of biogenic minerals on the plant surface. The presence of these minerals was proved by X-ray diffraction on the powders collected during the winter season on the surface of cordons and fruiting canes. We conclude that an approach to the estimation of the nutritional potentiality of the soil that includes the contribution of the throughfall is functional to the management of the agro-ecosystem.",The Science of the total environment,"['D000641', 'D000704', 'D000838', 'D002118', 'D002412', 'D004391', 'D004553', 'D005618', 'D019015', 'D006863', 'D007558', 'D008274', 'D010710', 'D011188', 'D011891', 'D013054', 'D027843', 'D014872', 'D014961']","['Ammonia', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anions', 'Calcium', 'Cations', 'Dust', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Fresh Water', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Italy', 'Magnesium', 'Phosphates', 'Potassium', 'Rain', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Vitis', 'Water Movements', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",From rainfall to throughfall in a maritime vineyard.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None]","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22995706,2013

The plant phenolic metabolic pathway has been well characterized, however many important questions remain regarding the influence of environmental conditions on pathway regulation. As a diagnostic for this pathway's regulation, we present a technique to incorporate a stable-isotopic tracer, L-phenyl-(13)C(6)-alanine (Phe(13)), into grape berries in situ and the accompanying high throughput analytical method based on LC-DAD-MS/MS to quantify and track the label into phenylalanine metabolites. Clusters of V. vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, either near the onset of ripening or 4 weeks later, were exposed to Phe(13) in the vineyard. Phe(13) was present in berries 9 days afterwards as well as labeled flavonols and anthocyanins, all of which possessed a molecular ion shift of 6 amu. However, nearly all the label was found in anthocyanins, indicating tight regulation of phenolic biosynthesis at this stage of maturity. This method provides a framework for examining the regulation of phenolic metabolism at different stages of maturity or under different environmental conditions.

22936644,"A new method for efficient ionization of sugars in the negative-ion mode of electrospray mass spectrometry is presented. Instead of using strongly hydrophobic dopants such as dichloromethane or chloroform, efficient ionization of sugars has been achieved by using aqueous HCl solution for the first time. This methodology makes it possible to use hydrophilic dopants, which are more appropriate for chromatographic separation techniques with efficient sugar ionization and detection in mass spectrometry. The interaction between chloride anions and monosaccharides (glucose and galactose) was studied by DFT in the gas phase and by implementing the polarizable continuum model (PCM) for calculations in solution at the high B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory. In all optimized geometries of identified [M+Cl](-)  anions, a non-covalent interaction exists. Differences were revealed between monodentate and bidentate complex anions, with the latter having noticeably higher binding energies. The calculated affinity of glucose and galactose toward the chloride anion in the gas phase and their chloride anion binding energies in solution are in excellent agreement with glucose and galactose [M+Cl](-)  experimental intensity profiles that are represented as a function of the chloride ion concentration. Density functional calculations of gas-phase affinities toward chloride anion were also performed for the studied disaccharides sucrose and gentiobiose. All calculations are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. An example is introduced wherein HCl was used to effectively ionize sugars and form chlorinated adduct anions to detect sugars and glycosylated metabolites (anthocyanins) in real biological systems (Vitis vinifera grape extracts and wines), whereas they would not have been easily detectable under standard infusion electrospray mass spectrometry conditions as deprotonated species.","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)","['D000838', 'D000872', 'D002241', 'D002712', 'D013058', 'D015394', 'D009005', 'D021241']","['Anions', 'Anthocyanins', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chlorides', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monosaccharides', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Attachment of chloride anion to sugars: mechanistic investigation and discovery of a new dopant for efficient sugar ionization/detection in mass spectrometers.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22936644,2013

Joboticaba (Myrciaria cauliflora) fruits, native to Brazil, have phenolics including anthocyanins and are processed into juice and other products. The phenolic constituents in the fruits of jaboticaba were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Twenty-two compounds were identified or tentatively determined by detailed analysis of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns; 11 compounds including 7 gallotannins, 2 ellagic acid derivatives, syringin, and its glucoside were detected for the first time in the fruit. The compositional differences among the fruit extracts and their commercial products were also compared by principal component analysis; two anthocyanins, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, as well as two depsides, jaboticabin and 2-O-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-2,4,6-trihydroxyphenylacetic acid, present in the fruit extracts were not detected unexpectedly in commercial jaboticaba juice or jam. Therefore, the stability of anthocyanins in jaboticaba fresh fruits and products has been compared directly with that of other dark-colored fruit products made from blueberry and Concord grape, and the same trend of decreasing amounts of anthocyanins was observed in all tested products. The antioxidant activities (DPPH(•) and ABTS(•+)) of jaboticaba fresh fruit extract and commercial samples were also compared. Principal component analysis proved to be a useful way to discern changes between fresh and processed fruits.

22778145,"Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is an economically important fruit crop that is subject to many types of insect and pathogen attack. To better elucidate the plant response to Lobesia botrana pathogen infection, we initiated a global comparative proteomic study monitoring steady-state protein expression as well as changes in N-glycosylation, phosphorylation, and Lys-acetylation in control and infected mesocarp and exocarp from V. vinifera cv Italia. A multi-parallel, large-scale proteomic approach employing iTRAQ labeling prior to three peptide enrichment techniques followed by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of a total of 3059 proteins, 1135 phosphorylation sites, 323 N-linked glycosylation sites and 138 Lys-acetylation sites. Of these, we could identify changes in abundance of 899 proteins. The occupancy of 110 phosphorylation sites, 10 N-glycosylation sites and 20 Lys-acetylation sites differentially changed during L. botrana infection. Sequence consensus analysis for phosphorylation sites showed eight significant motifs, two of which containing up-regulated phosphopeptides (X-G-S-X and S-X-X-D) and two containing down-regulated phosphopeptides (R-X-X-S and S-D-X-E) in response to pathogen infection. Topographical distribution of phosphorylation sites within primary sequences reveal preferential phosphorylation at both the N- and C termini, and a clear preference for C-terminal phosphorylation in response to pathogen infection suggesting induction of region-specific kinase(s). Lys-acetylation analysis confirmed the consensus X-K-Y-X motif previously detected in mammals and revealed the importance of this modification in plant defense. The importance of N-linked protein glycosylation in plant response to biotic stimulus was evident by an up-regulated glycopeptide belonging to the disease resistance response protein 206.

Since there is no data available on their glycosidic fractions, at a first step, two hydrolyse procedures, acid and enzymatic, were carried out using Boal grapes as matrix. Several parameters susceptible of influencing the hydrolytic process were studied. The best results, expressed as GC peak area, number of identified components and reproducibility, were obtained using ProZym M with b-glucosidase activity at 35°C for 42h. For the extraction of hydrolytically released components, HS-SPME technique was evaluated as a reliable and improved alternative to the conventional extraction technique, LLE (ethyl acetate). HS-SPME using DVB/CAR/PDMS as coating fiber displayed an extraction capacity two fold higher than LLE (ethyl acetate). The hydrolyzed fraction was mainly characterized by the occurrence of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, followed by acids, esters, carbonyl compounds, terpenoids, and volatile phenols. Concerning to terpenoids its contribution to the total hydrolyzed fraction is highest for Malvasia Cândida (23%) and Malvasia Roxa (13%), and their presence according previous studies, even at low concentration, is important from a sensorial point of view (can impart floral notes to the wines), due to their low odor threshold (μg/L). According to the obtained data by principal component analysis (PCA), the sensorial properties of Madeira wines produced by Malvasia Cândida and Malvasia Roxa could be improved by hydrolysis procedure, since their hydrolyzed fraction is mainly characterized by terpenoids (e.g. linalool, geraniol) which are responsible for floral notes.

The mean recoveries of the pesticides were 75% - 119% with the relative standard deviation values less than 16.6% except for dimethoate. The performance of the analyte protectants was compared with matrix-matched standards calibration curves in terms of quantitative accuracy. The results showed that the method of adding analyte protectants can replace the matrix-matched standard calibration, and can also reduce the sample pretreatment. When the devel- oped method was used for the analysis of apple, peache, orange, banana, grape and other fruit samples, a good matrix compensation effect was achieved, and thus effectively reduced the bad effects of the water-soluble agents to the gas chromatographic column.",Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,"['D005506', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D000069463', 'D010573', 'D010938', 'D011092']","['Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Olive Oil', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plant Oils', 'Polyethylene Glycols']",[Rapid determination of 40 pesticide residues in fruits using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with analyte protectants to compensate for matrix effects].,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22715692,2014

22703561,"This study evaluated the formation of anthocyanin-derived compounds during the production of sweet red wines from Merlot and Syrah grapes previously chamber-dried under controlled-temperature conditions. The musts from both grape varieties were found to contain pelargonidin-3-glucoside throughout the vinification process. Besides, HPLC-DAD-MS revealed the presence of pyranoanthocyanins in unfermented musts from the raisins. These compounds are adducts resulting from the cycloaddition of pyruvic acid (type A vitisins) and acetaldehyde (type B vitisins) to anthocyanin molecules. The analyses additionally revealed the presence of products of the condensation via a methylmethine bridge between anthocyanins and (epi)catechin, which requires the presence of acetaldehyde. The absence of pyruvic acid, acetaldehyde, and ethanol in the musts from fresh grapes and their presence in those from dried grapes support the idea that these compounds result from enzymatic transformations because the vinification of the musts involves no alcoholic fermentation. The drying process alters the permeability of grape membranes by the lipoxygenase activation effect (LOX), a switch to an anaerobic metabolism and the resulting triggering of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme (ADH). The activation of these and several other enzymes confirmed the occurrence of enzymatic transformations and the formation of vitisin A, acetylvitisin A, and the B vitisins of malvidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-acetylglucoside, and malvidin-3-acetylglucoside, as well as the adducts Pn-3-glc-methylmethine(epi)catechin, Mv-3-glc-methylmethine(epi) catechin, and Mv-3-acetylmethylmethine(epi)catechin.

22688044,"During the off-vine natural withering process of Erbaluce (white) grapes to obtain ""Erbaluce Caluso"" Passito wine, some berries change in color from green-yellow to blue. This phenomenon appears at different extents in different years and might be related to several parameters, such as temperature and humidity during withering, grape composition and Botrytis cinerea loading. To better understand the mechanism involved in color variation, the metabolic changes corresponding to this event were studied. At the end of the withering process berries with different colors were separated using a reflectance spectrophotometer, obtaining three color classes identified as ""green"" (L*=40.3, a*=-0.56, b*=15.20), ""gold"" (L*=37.7, a*=5.01, b*=14.12) and ""blue"" (L*=28.6, a*=0.89, b*=-0.67). The three groups of berries had different water contents, the blue berries containing about 30% less water than the green ones. Samples were crushed and the juices were analyzed. The juice yield for blue berries was less than 50% of that of the other two classes, confirming their higher dehydration level. Protein extraction from de-seeded berries was carried out using two different protocols, the first involving a treatment with phenol (to remove polyphenolic substances) and the second based on an extraction with a mild detergent (to recover the proteins to be used for enzymatic analyses). No trace of laccase activity was found in any of the samples, although DNA analysis, by quantitative PCR, suggested the presence of B. cinerea infection in the blue grapes. Chitinase activity of the blue berries was only 30% of that of the other two samples, as confirmed also by zymographic analysis on electrophoretic gels. The same was found also for esterase activity, which was lower (of about 85%) in the blue berries, which, in contrast, showed the highest beta-glucosidase activity. The electrophoretic analysis of the protein extracts revealed strong differences among the samples. Compared to the green and gold ones, the blue berries showed a complete absence of bands corresponding to chitinases and the appearance of unusual protein bands. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that these latter proteins were of grape origin, the main of them corresponding to β-1,3-glucanase, although no significant increase in glucanase activity was measured in the corresponding protein extract.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D002688', 'D003116', 'D004798', 'D004950', 'D005959', 'D006813', 'D013058', 'D011506', 'D013053', 'D013696', 'D027843']","['Chitinases', 'Color', 'Enzymes', 'Esterases', 'Glucosidases', 'Humidity', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Proteins', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Temperature', 'Vitis']",Proteins and enzymatic activities in Erbaluce grape berries with different response to the withering process.,"['Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000201']","['metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22688044,2012

22688041,"In the oenological sector, the withering process is of particular importance in the production of dry and sweet dessert wines due to the total or partial use of overripe and/or dehydrated grapes. This complex process leads to several changes in the chemical-physical characteristics of white grape berries affecting the wine quality and, at the end of the dehydration period, different visual attributes are usually present in the berry skins. The aim of this work, therefore, was to study the properties of Erbaluce dried grapes of varying external colors, classified into three groups based on reflectance colorimetry (green, gold and blue). The chemical composition, volatile profile and mechanical attributes were investigated, focusing on establishing relationships between CIEL*a*b* parameters of dehydrated grapes and their chemical-physical characteristics. The higher values of the glucose-fructose ratio, together with the higher content of sugars, gluconic acid and glycerol, but lower titratable acidity, suggests the presence of Botrytis cinerea Pers. infection in blue withered berries, which has been microbiologically confirmed. Regarding the instrumental mechanical properties, blue dehydrated grapes were characterized by a lower skin hardness and higher skin thickness in agreement with the higher weight loss experienced. Finally, the determination of free and bound volatile compounds showed that some of them were only found in blue withered berries, δ-lactones being considered the main chemical markers of the noble rot infection that are important for the odor character.

22688039,"Phenolics are responsible for important sensory properties of red wines, including colour, astringency, and possibly bitterness. From a technical viewpoint, the harvest date and the maceration duration are critical decisions for producing red wine with a distinctive style. But little is known about the evolution of phenolics and of their extractability during ripening to predict the composition of the wine and related sensory properties. The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between the sensory profile of the wines and (i) the ripening stage of the berries (harvest date) and (ii) the extraction time (maceration duration). Phenolic acids, flavonols, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins of Vitis Vinifera var. Cabernet franc were measured in grapes and in wines from two stages of maturity and with two maceration durations. Phenolic composition was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography, after fractionation and thiolysis for proanthocyanidins. The distinctive style of wines was investigated by descriptive analysis (trained panel), Just About Right profiles and typicality assessment (wine expert panel). Relationships between phenolics and sensory attributes were established by multidimensional analysis, and phenolics were classified according to sensory data by ANOVA and PLS regressions. Astringency, bitterness, colour intensity and alcohol significantly increased with ripening and astringency and colour intensity increased with maceration time. Grape anthocyanins increased and thiolysis yield significantly decreased with ripening. In wine, proanthocyanidins increased, and mean degree of polymerisation and thiolysis yield decreased with longer extraction time. The high impact of harvest date on the sensory profiles could be due to changes in anthocyanin and sugar contents, but also to an evolution of proanthocyanidins. Moreover, proanthocyanidin composition was affected by maceration time as suggested by the decrease of thiolysis yield. Our results suggest that the wine sensory quality established by the expert panel, is linked as expected to grape quality at harvest, reflected by sugar and anthocyanin contents, but also by thiolysis yield, which requires elucidation.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D000872', 'D003116', 'D044948', 'D010636', 'D025341', 'D044945', 'D013649', 'D013997', 'D014920']","['Anthocyanins', 'Color', 'Flavonols', 'Phenols', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Taste', 'Time Factors', 'Wine']",Sensory representation of typicality of Cabernet franc wines related to phenolic composition: impact of ripening stage and maceration time.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22688039,2012

The highest contents in anthocyanins were found at pre-harvest, following by harvest and finally at over-ripening. Within each physiological stage, the relative abundance of acylated derivatives was influenced by the soluble solids contents. The percentages of acylated anthocyanins tend to decrease as the soluble solids contents. Differences in the anthocyanin extractabilities were highly influenced by the physiological stages and in a lesser extent by the soluble solids contents. The lowest extraction percentages were obtained in pre-harvest samples whatever soluble solids contents.

HFD induced ectopic deposition of cholesterol and phospholipid but not triglyceride. Moreover brain lipotoxicity is linked to an oxidative stress characterized by increased lipoperoxidation and carbonylation, inhibition of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities, depletion of manganese and a concomitant increase in ionizable calcium and acetylcholinesterase activity.

22649546,"An important process for the regulation of auxin levels in plants is the inactivation of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) by conjugation to amino acids. The conjugation reaction is catalysed by IAA-amido synthetases belonging to the family of GH3 proteins. Genetic approaches to study the biological significance of these enzymes have been hampered by large gene numbers and a high degree of functional redundancy. To overcome these difficulties a chemical approach based on the reaction mechanism of GH3 proteins was employed to design a small molecule inhibitor of IAA-amido synthetase activity. Adenosine-5'-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]phosphate (AIEP) mimics the adenylated intermediate of the IAA-conjugation reaction and was therefore proposed to compete with the binding of MgATP and IAA in the initial stages of catalysis. Two grapevine IAA-amido synthetases with different catalytic properties were chosen to test the inhibitory effects of AIEP in vitro. GH3-1 has previously been implicated in the grape berry ripening process and is restricted to two amino acid substrates, whereas GH3-6 conjugated IAA to 13 amino acids. AIEP is the most potent inhibitor of GH3 enzymes so far described and was shown to be competitive against MgATP and IAA binding to both enzymes with K(i)-values 17-68-fold lower than the respective K(m)-values. AIEP also exhibited in vivo activity in an ex planta test system using young grape berries. Exposure to 5-20 µM of the inhibitor led to decreased levels of the common conjugate IAA-Asp and reduced the accumulation of the corresponding Asp-conjugate upon treatment with a synthetic auxin. AIEP therefore represents a novel chemical probe with which to study IAA-amido synthetase function.",PloS one,"['D000249', 'D000596', 'D002852', 'D002853', 'D017931', 'D004591', 'D007210', 'D007211', 'D007700', 'D046911', 'D015394', 'D009097', 'D013021', 'D053719', 'D027843']","['Adenosine Monophosphate', 'Amino Acids', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Indoleacetic Acids', 'Indoles', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'South Australia', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vitis']",A novel tool for studying auxin-metabolism: the inhibition of grapevine indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetases by a reaction intermediate analogue.,"['Q000031', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000138', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000037', None, None, 'Q000201']","['analogs & derivatives', 'metabolism', None, None, 'genetics', None, 'metabolism', 'chemical synthesis', None, 'metabolism', None, 'antagonists & inhibitors', None, None, 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22649546,2012

22630367,"The effects of the severity of post-flowering leaf removal on the growth and phenolic composition of berry skin and seeds were studied in three Vitis vinifera L. genotypes over two consecutive seasons, 2007 and 2008. The study was conducted in a commercial vertical shoot positioned (VSP)-trained nonirrigated vineyard of northern Greece, planted with cultivars Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Sangiovese. Three different severities of leaf removal in the fruit zone were applied manually at berry set: nondefoliated (ND), removal of the lateral shoots of the first six basal nodes (LR), and full removal of the total leaf area (main leaves and lateral shoots) of the first six basal nodes (FR). Grape samples were obtained at commercial harvest. Leaf removal decreased yield per vine and cluster weight in Merlot and Sangiovese. Cluster compactness was reduced with the severity of defoliation only in Merlot, due to a decrease in berry number per cluster; berry fresh weight was unaffected in both cultivars. On the contrary, in Cabernet Sauvignon, yield was unaffected but berry size was restrained by leaf removal. Skin and seed mass followed variations in berry mass (except for seed mass in Sangiovese). Fruit zone leaf removal did not affect must soluble solids and increased titratable acidity only in Merlot. Defoliation increased skin anthocyanins in Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in the order FR > LR > ND but significantly reduced seed flavan-3-ols mainly as a result of the reduction in catechin and epicatechin amount. For these varieties, FR had lower seed flavan-3-ols than ND in both varieties, whereas LR had intermediate values. However, in Sangiovese, the highest seed phenolic content was recorded in LR. The results showed that post-flowering leaf removal improved the overall berry composition in Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon but had limited effect in Sangiovese.

We recently demonstrated that dietary supplementation with a specific grape-derived polyphenolic preparation (GP) significantly improves cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). GP is comprised of the proanthocyanidin (PAC) catechin and epicatechin in monomeric (Mo), oligomeric, and polymeric forms. In this study, we report that following oral administration of the independent GP forms, only Mo is able to improve cognitive function and only Mo metabolites can selectively reach and accumulate in the brain at a concentration of ∼400 nM. Most importantly, we report for the first time that a biosynthetic epicatechin metabolite, 3'-O-methyl-epicatechin-5-O-β-glucuronide (3'-O-Me-EC-Gluc), one of the PAC metabolites identified in the brain following Mo treatment, promotes basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation at physiologically relevant concentrations in hippocampus slices through mechanisms associated with cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) signaling.

Free and bound volatile compounds were analyzed in Cencibel, Bobal, and Moravia Agria monovarietal wines, and in 3 wines obtained with the blending of grapes: Cencibel (50%) + Bobal (50%); Cencibel (50%) + Moravía Agria (50%); Cencibel (33%) + Bobal (33%) + Moravía Agria (33%). Aroma compounds were studied in terms of odor activity values (OAVs). Ninety free aroma compounds and sixty-five bound aroma compounds were identified and quantified.

The fruity and sweet series contributed most strongly to the aroma profile of all wines, independently of the winemaking technique used. In general, co-winemaking wines present a more complex chemical profile than monovarietal wines. Practical Application: Some grape varieties could benefit from this process with the presence of other varieties that might have an excess of aroma compounds. In this study, the wines were elaborated by blending different grape varieties together; this process implies co-maceration and co-fermentation steps.

Results showed that when Merlot GSF was heated to ≥180 °C, significant decreases in the TPC and antioxidant activity, measured using FRAP, DPPH, and TEAC, were observed. Longer heating times also caused a reduction in antioxidant capability. Catechin and epicatechin content decreased with increasing heating temperature while gallocatechin and gallic acid content increased. Both catechin and epicatechin content had strong positive correlations (r > 0.91) with TPC and TFC, as well with FRAP and TEAC, suggesting that the GSF antioxidant activity is related to the presence of these particular compounds. Overall, while a decrease in antioxidant content was observed during heating, this occurred at higher baking temperatures.

These wines were obtained from different vineyards having a significant role in the wine market: Cotesti, Tohani, Stefanesti, Aiud, Cotnari, Bucium, Murfatlar, Bujoru, Dragasani and Valea Calugareasca. Several observations related to the dependence of isotope ratios on geographical origin and climatic conditions were drawn. The authentic wines obtained from the FA grape variety from six different vineyards showed δ(18)O values in the range of+3.28 (Cotesti region - 45 °38'N/27 °04'E) to-2.60 ‰ (Aiud region - 46 °19'N/23 °45'E).

This study sought to determine the validity of TSS in predicting the aroma composition of the juice while also investigating other potentially useful indicators, including pH, titratable acidity (TA), and TSS:TA ratio. Grapes were harvested from 9 sites in the Lake Erie Concord Grape Belt and stratified from north to south and east to west. The key aroma compounds methyl anthranilate (""grapey"") and trans-2-hexenal (""herbaceous"") were quantified along with several other odorants. It was observed that while TSS was a robust predictor of monomeric anthocyanin content across sites, it was a poor predictor of aroma compounds in the finished juice. Conversely, pH, TA, and TSS:TA ratio were all significantly correlated with methyl anthranilate and trans-2-hexenal concentrations (P < 0.05) in samples equal to or exceeding 15 Brix, the industry minimum for grape maturity.

22372567,"Most research on the extraction of high-priced compounds from vineyard/wine byproducts has traditionally been focused on grape seeds and skins as raw materials. Vine-shoots can represent an additional source to those materials, the characteristics of which could depend on the cultivar. A comparative study of hydroalcoholic extracts from 18 different vineyard cultivars obtained by superheated liquid extraction (SHLE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), and ultrasound-assisted extraction (USAE) is here presented. The optimal working conditions for each type of extraction have been investigated by using multivariate experimental designs to maximize the yield of total phenolic compounds, measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and control hydroxymethylfurfural because of the organoleptic properties of furanic derivatives and toxicity at given levels. The best values found for the influential variables on each extraction method were 80% (v/v) aqueous ethanol at pH 3, 180 °C, and 60 min for SHLE; 140 W and 5 min microwave irradiation for MAE; and 280 W, 50% duty cycle, and 7.5 min extraction for USAE. SHLE reported better extraction efficiencies as compared to the other two approaches, supporting the utility of SHLE for scaling-up the process. The extracts were dried in a rotary evaporator, reconstituted in 5 mL of methanol, and finally subjected to liquid-liquid extraction with n-hexane to remove nonpolar compounds that could complicate chromatographic separation.

In addition, relationships between the instrumental (volatile) and sensory variables were analyzed through the application of partial least squares regression (PLSR). Results revealed that the effect of ""cultivar"" was very important as a third of compounds (16 in total) varied significantly (P≤0.05) among varieties. Mencía wines presented the highest concentrations of γ-nonalactone, whereas Sousón wines were the richest in monoterpene compounds.

Twenty out of 51 quantified volatile compounds were present in some samples at concentrations higher than their corresponding odor thresholds (OAV>1), thus contributing to the final wine aroma. Partial least square (PLS) regression was applied to volatile compounds with OAV>0.2 and aroma descriptors with %GM>10.

In this study, we investigated the cancer chemopreventive properties of procyanidins from wild grape (Vitis amurensis) seeds in particular their roles in inducing phase II detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes as well as in modulating the upstream kinases. Ethanolic extract of V. amurensis seeds was fractionated with a series of organic solvents and finally separated into six fractions, F1-F6. Chemical properties of the procyanidins were analyzed by vanillin assay, BuOH-HCl test, and depolymerization with phloroglucinol followed by LC/MS analysis. The F5 had the highest procyanidin content among all the fractions and strongly induced the reporter activity of antioxidant response element as well as the protein expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2) in HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells. The procyanidin-rich F5 also strongly induced the expression of the phase II detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1 and hemeoxygenase1. Phosphorylations of the upstream kinases such as MAPKs and PI3K/Akt were significantly increased by treatment with procyanidin fraction. In addition, the procyanidin-mediated Nrf2 expression was partly attenuated by PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and almost completely by p38 inhibitor SB202190, but neither by JNK inhibitor SP600125 nor by MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126.

In this present study we aimed for a green approach to synthesize palladium nanoparticles by reducing palladium chloride salts with nontoxic and biodegradable polymeric chitosan and grape polyphenols and confirmed by FTIR, TEM, SEM and UV-spectroscopy. We also extended our study to show the efficacy of the grape and chitosan impregnated palladium nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent against Escherichia coli. Antibacterial assays were carried out with a representative gram-negative bacterium, E. coli and a gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus. Commendable efforts have been made to explore this property using electron microscopy, which has revealed size dependent interaction of palladium nanoparticles conjugates with bacteria by disrupting cell membranes and the leakage of cytoplasm.

Less attention has been paid to the presence of stilbene derivatives in viticultural residues, such as grape canes. The present work reports the first results of a systematic study of stilbene levels in different grape varieties and cultivation areas in Chile, to evaluate their potential as an alternative source of bioactive stilbenes. In all cane samples, the predominant stilbene is trans-resveratrol, followed by ε-viniferin and piceatannol. In canes of Pinot noir up to 5590 ± 172 mg kg(-1) of trans-resveratrol and up to 6915 ± 175 mg kg(-1) of total stilbenes were detected. The observed concentrations of stilbenes in canes of Pinot noir from southern Chile until now are higher than those reported previously for this red variety. However, the highest concentration of total stilbenes observed in the analyzed samples was in the canes of white variety Gewürztraminer with 7857 ± 498 mg kg(-1).

Diverse classes of phenolics are derived from the seed and skin (GSK) of grapes. The relative contributions of the classes of phenolics to observed properties of grape products are unknown. In this paper, GSK fractions were used to examine effects on platelet aggregation, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation in vitro, and relative binding of phenolics to LDL. GSK was separated into six fractions (fractions 1-6), and primary phenolics were characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Fractions 4, 5, and 6, enriched in polygalloyl polyflavan-3-ols (PGPFs) with 3-6, 4-8, and 6-15 degrees of polymerization, respectively, inhibited platelet aggregation. Fractions 1-3, containing various amounts of oligosaccharides, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, flavanols, and low molecular weight PGPFs, significantly increased platelet aggregation. Fractions 4-6 were most effective in binding LDL and inhibiting LDL oxidation. Fractions 5 and 6 exhibited the greatest inhibition of platelet aggregation and LDL oxidation, suggesting that polymeric PGPFs are responsible for the beneficial effects of grape products. Conversely, phenolics in fractions 1-3 may reduce the net biological potency of the grape products and have undesirable effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors.

After grading, bunches were subjected to 0.0, 0.5, 1.5 or 3 kJm(-2) and then stored at 5 degrees C and 90% relative humidity (RH) for 6 weeks followed by a 2 day shelf-life at 25 degrees C and 70% RH. A weekly inspection was performed and a visual evaluation of the appearance, treatment damage, stems browning and berry shrivelling was performed. Weight loss, decay and shatter were quantified at the end of storage and shelf-life. Regardless the cv and UV-C dose, fruit appearance was acceptable until the end of storage and shelf-life. Among the cvs, the highest score was held by 'G. Perlon'. After the fourth week of storage, the berries of 'Centennial S.' turned light brown and darkened over time when treated with 3.0 kJm(-2). Stem browning was not induced by the light treatment, but resulted cv depended and was pronounced for 'Centennial S.' and 'Dawn S.'. Berry shrivelling was insignificant, while shatter was very high in 'Corina' and did not depend upon UV-C treatment. Regarding weight loss, differences could not be attributed to the light treatment and after storage it ranged from 3 up to 5%. Decay was significantly reduced by light treatment and the efficacy increased by raising the dose. Botrytis cinerea was the main cause of decay with 'Corina' being the most jeopardized, followed by 'Dawn S.' and 'Centennial S.', whereas 'G. Perlon' resulted the less affected.

Only acetaldehyde, diethoxy-1,1-ethane, and sotolon have been described as key odorants. In the present work, three wines (vintages 2002 and 2003) were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) aroma extract dilution analysis. The goal was to assess the relative impact of varietal, fermentation, and oak-barrel compounds by using two complementary extraction procedures. No grape terpenoids were found after the long barrel aging (6 years and 3 months). On the other hand, two candy/fruity esters issued from yeast exhibited high flavor dilution factor (FD) values: ethyl isobutyrate (64-1024) and ethyl isovalerate (128-1024). As expected, many oak-related odorants were found in the XAD 2 flavor extracts, mainly homofuraneol [2-ethyl-4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone] (cotton candy, FD = 16-256) and cis-β-methyloctalactone (butter, woody, FD = 256). Most probably issued from oxidation of the grape constituent theaspirane, an exceptional grenadine odor was perceived by GC-O up to dilution 64-1024. Chemical oxidation experiments and GC-high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) allowed us to identify it as 4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionone (RI(CPsil5CB) = 1373), a hydrolysis-derived product of dihydrodehydro-β-ionone. With an extraction dedicated to hydrophilic compounds, the key role of sotolon was confirmed (112-387 μg/kg; FD = 256-1024).

22101466,"The inner bark of Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum L.) is commonly used as a spice and has also been widely employed in the treatment and prevention of disease. The positive health effects associated with the consumption of cinnamon could in part be due to its phenolic composition; proanthocyanidins (PA) are the major polyphenolic component in commercial cinnamon. We present a thorough study of the PA profile of cinnamon obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry. In addition to the advantages of MALDI-TOF as a sensitive technique for the analysis of high-molecular-weight compounds, the tandem arrangement allows the identification of the compounds through their fragmentation patterns from MS/MS experiments. This is the first time that this technique has been used to analyze polymeric PA. The results show that cinnamon PA are more complex than was previously thought. We show here for the first time that they contain (epi)gallocatechin and (epi)catechingallate units. As gallates (galloyl moieties) and the pyrogallol group in gallocatechins have been related to the biological activity of grape and tea polyphenols, the presence of these substructures may explain some of the properties of cinnamon extracts. MALDI-TOF/TOF reveals that cinnamon bark PA include combinations of (epi)catechin, (epi)catechingallate, (epi)gallocatechin, and (epi)afzelechin, which results in a highly heterogeneous mixture of procyanidins, prodelphinidins, and propelargonidins.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000872', 'D002935', 'D059808', 'D044945', 'D019032']","['Anthocyanins', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum', 'Polyphenols', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",New identification of proanthocyanidins in cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum L.) using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101466,2012

The proportion of epigallocatechin increased with increasing DP in skin PA. Wine PA had a DP range and composition similar to the distribution of skin PA between DP 4 and 18 suggesting that larger skin PAs are not extracted into wine.

C(6)-compounds, alcohols, volatile fatty acids, monoterpenes, C(13)-norisoprenoids, volatile phenols and carbonyl compounds were identified and quantified in free and glycosidically bound forms by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The total volatile concentration showed a significant increase between the two ripening stages studied for all cultivars. The free volatile composition increased during maturity for Godello and Serradelo cultivars; however the glycosidically bound concentration increases for all cultivars with exception of B. lexitimo. Free C(6)-compounds ((E)-2-hexanal, 1-hexanol and (E)-2-hexen-1-ol) and bound alcohols (benzyl alcohol and 2-phenylethanol) showed the highest concentrations of volatile compounds for all grape cultivars in the two dates studied. Godello cultivar showed the highest change of volatile concentration between two ripening dates because of the high value of free C(6)-compounds. B. lexitimo was the most terpene-rich cultivar at the last ripening stage due to linalool; however C(13)-norisoprenoids in free form were detected in low concentrations for all cultivars but not in Godello and B. lexitimo cultivars at the last ripening stage. Free hexanoic acid increased during ripening in all cultivars. The evolution of volatiles during ripening of grape juice from the cultivars studied was not proportional to the changes in sugar content, which shows that the technological and aromatic maturities did not occur at the same time in these cultivars.

22026389,"We investigated in total 80 wine samples of different types and seven grape juice and 23 beer samples purchased from markets in Central Europe in order to understand the arsenic (As) speciation and help assess the potential As toxicity via intake of alcoholic beverages. Generally, total As concentrations in most samples investigated were below the drinking water limit 10 µg l(-1) published by the World Health Organization (WHO); ranging from 0.46 to 21.0 µg l(-1) As in red and white wines and from 0.75 to 13.4 µg l(-1) As in beers. In addition, concentrations of total As in rice wine and in rice beer were 0.63-6.07 and 3.69-8.23 µg l(-1) As, respectively. The total As concentrations in ice wine ranged from 7.94 to 18.8 µg l(-1) As, significantly higher than in white and red wine. Arsenite predominated as the As species in most of the wine samples, whereas arsenate was the dominant species in rice wine, beer and rice beer. Methyl As components were usually minor components in all wine and beer samples. Monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid and two additional unknown As species were frequently found in grape juice, late harvest and ice wine with higher sweetness. After air exposure, arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid were stable at 4°C for months, probably due to the acidic conditions of wine and beer samples. The presence of sulfite had little influence on As speciation in wine. Despite the predominance of more toxic arsenite and arsenate in wine and beer, the estimated weekly exposure to As (via consumption of beer, wine and rice wine) is low. The As intake per capita is 6.81 µg from beer, <1.93 µg from wine and 0.88 µg from rice wine, estimated using the median of total As concentration multiplied by the average consumption per capita of the corresponding beverage.","Food additives & contaminants.

As a contribution towards this goal, an original analytical method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of melatonin and other indolic and phenolic antioxidants (including trans- and cis-resveratrol, ferulic acid, tryptophan, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) in grape-related foodstuffs and beverages: namely grape, grape juice, must, wine and grappa (Italian pomace brandy). These foodstuffs represent an important part of the diet, both traditionally and in recent times, especially in Mediterranean countries and could be (at least in part) responsible for the beneficial effects involved in the 'French paradox'. The analytical method is based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to fluorescence detection, exploiting the native fluorescence of the analytes. A C8 column was used as the stationary phase, while the mobile phase was composed of acidic phosphate buffer and acetonitrile; fluorescence intensity was monitored at λ=386nm while exciting at λ=298nm. The sample pretreatment was carried out by a fast and reliable microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) procedure. After validation, the method was applied to the analysis of melatonin and other antioxidants in food and beverages derived from grape, with very good results being obtained.

The estimation of pH of fruit juices was done by using Systronic upH 362 pH meter. The erosive effects of fruit juices were tested by using polarized light microscope. Orion electrode was used to measure fluoride. The trace elements were estimated by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer No. 6501F. The pH values in different juices were observed at different levels, and pH values of these juices were more acidic than baseline after 24 hours.

Other than the foxy-smelling compounds in  Vitis labrusca  and  Vitis rotundifolia , the aromas inherent to American Vitis species are not well characterized. In this paper, the key odorants in wine produced from the American grape species  Vitis riparia  and  Vitis cinerea  were characterized in comparison to wine produced from European winegrapes (V. vinifera). Volatile compounds were extracted by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and identified by gas chromatography-olfactometry/mass spectrometry (GC-O/MS). On the basis of flavor dilution values, most grape-derived compounds with fruity and floral aromas were at similar potency, but non-vinifera wines had higher concentrations of odorants with vegetative and earthy aromas: eugenol, cis-3-hexenol, 1,8-cineole, 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP), and 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IPMP). Elevated concentrations of these compounds in non-vinifera wines were confirmed by quantitative GC-MS. Concentrations of IBMP and IPMP were well above sensory threshold in both non-vinifera wines. In a follow-up study, IBMP and IPMP were surveyed in 31 accessions of V. riparia, V. rupestris, and V. cinerea.

21858493,"Acetaldehyde is a known mutagen and carcinogen. Active aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) represents an important mechanism for acetaldehyde detoxification. A yeast strain XJ-2 isolated from grape samples was found to produce acetaldehyde dehydrogenase with a high activity of 2.28 U/mg and identified as Issatchenkia terricola. The enzyme activity was validated by oxidizing acetaldehyde to acetate with NAD(+) as coenzyme based on the headspace gas chromatography analysis. A novel acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ist-ALD) was cloned by combining SiteFinding-PCR and self-formed adaptor PCR. The ist-ALD gene comprised an open reading frame of 1,578 bp and encoded a protein of 525 amino acids. The predicted protein of ist-ALD showed the highest identity (73%) to ALDH from Pichia angusta. The ist-ALD gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the gene product (ist-ALDH) presented a productivity of 442.3 U/mL cells. The purified ist-ALDH was a homotetramer of 232 kDa consisting of 57 kDa-subunit according to the SDS-PAGE and native PAGE analysis. Ist-ALDH exhibited the optimal activity at pH 9.0 and 40°C, respectively. The activity of ist-ALDH was enhanced by K(+), NH4(+), dithiothreitol, and 2-mercaptoethanol but strongly inhibited by Ag(+), Hg(2+), Cu(2+), and phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride. In the presence of NAD(+), ist-ALDH could oxidize many aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic aldehydes, preferably acetaldehyde. Kinetic study revealed that ist-ALDH had a k                         (cat) value of 27.71/s and a k                         (cat)/K                         (m) value of 26.80 × 10(3)/(mol s) on acetaldehyde, demonstrating ist-ALDH, a catalytically active enzyme by comparing with other ALDHs.

A novel, simple, low-cost and fast method was developed and validated for trace residue extraction of pesticides, dioxin-like PCBs and PAHs from water and water based samples followed by analysis through gas chromatography (GC) coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToFMS). The extraction solvent type, volume; sample volume and other extraction conditions were optimized. This was achieved by extracting 10 mL sample with 250 μL chloroform by vortexing (1 min, standing time of 2 min) followed by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 5 min). The bottom organic layer (200 μL) was pipetted out, evaporated to near dryness and reconstituted in 20 μL of ethyl acetate+cyclohexane (1:9) mixture resulting in an enrichment factor of 400. The recoveries of all compounds were within 76-120% (±10%) with the method detection limit (MDL) ranging from 1 to 250 ng/L depending on the analyte response. The MDLs were 400 times lower than the instrument quantification limits that ranged from 0.4 to 100 ng/mL. The method was further validated in water based drinks (e.g. apple, lemon, pineapple, orange, grape and pomegranate juice). For the juices with suspended pulp, the extraction was carried out with 400 μL chloroform. The extract was analyzed by GC-ToFMS at both 1D and GC×GC modes to chromatographically separate closely eluting interfering compounds the effect of which could not be minimized otherwise. The resulting peak table was filtered to identify a range of compounds belonging to specific classes viz. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated, brominated, and nitro compounds.

21732693,"A simple, reliable, and sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for the quantification of volatile and nonvolatile biogenic amines in Port wines and grape juices was developed and evaluated. The method was based on a previously reported two-phase derivatization procedure with isobutyl chloroformate in a toluene medium, which provides a quantitative reaction in 10 min. Following the derivatization step, the excess of reagent was eliminated by treatment with alkaline methanol. The derivatization procedure was performed directly on 1 mL of sample, avoiding any fastidious and time-consuming cleanup extraction steps. The method allows the simultaneous quantification of 22 amines, which can be found in wines: methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, butylamine, isobutylamine, amylamine, isoamylamine, 2-methylbutylamine, hexylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, 1,3-diaminopropane, putrescine, cadaverine, 1,6-diaminohexane, 2-phenylethylamine, histamine, and tyramine. Because of the fact that histamine and tyramine derivatives are degraded during the isobutyl chloroformate elimination step, the corresponding determination was made after removal of the excess of derivatizing reagent by evaporating an aliquot of the toluene layer obtained after the reaction. The presented method showed excellent analytical characteristics in what linearity, recovery, repeatability, and limit of detections were respected. It was used to assess the concentration of biogenic amines in juice grapes and Tawny and Vintage Port wines with different aging times. On the whole, the total content of amines in Port wines was low. Most of the amines found in wines have their origin in the raw material used for their elaboration, so the Port winemaking process is not prone to the production of this kind of compounds.

Recently, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) accepted the health claim related to melatonin and the alleviation of subjective feelings of jet lag. This molecule has been detected in some foods. In this work, 13 grape varieties were studied; 7 monovarietal wines were produced in an experimental winery under strictly controlled conditions and were sampled in different steps. The grape varieties used to make the wines were: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Tempranillo, Tintilla de Rota, Palomino Fino and Alpha red. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) unequivocally confirmed the presence of melatonin in wines. The main contribution of this paper is the results that clearly show that melatonin is synthesised during the winemaking process, specifically after the alcoholic fermentation.

Grapes were harvested throughout the day/night to determine the moment when high levels of these components are present in grapes. The presence of melatonin in grapes was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. It is shown for the first time that melatonin levels fluctuate during the day/night cycle in plants grown under field conditions in a fruit organ of the species Vitis vinifera. We also determined that the diurnal decay of melatonin in berry skins is induced by sunlight, because covered bunches retained higher melatonin levels than exposed ones, thus explaining at least part of the basis of its daily fluctuation.

21576399,"Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is an economically important fruit crop. Quality-determining grape components, such as sugars, acids, flavours, anthocyanins, tannins, etc., are accumulated during the different grape berry development stages. Thus, correlating the proteomic profiles with the biochemical and physiological changes occurring in grape is of paramount importance to advance the understanding of the berry development and ripening processes. Here, the developmental analysis of V. vinifera cv. Muscat Hamburg berries is reported at protein level, from fruit set to full ripening. A top-down proteomic approach based on differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE) followed by tandem mass spectrometry led to identification and quantification of 156 and 61 differentially expressed proteins in green and ripening phases, respectively. Two key points in development, with respect to changes in protein level, were detected: end of green development and beginning of ripening. The profiles of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes were consistent with a net conversion of sucrose to malate during green development. Pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase is likely to play a key role to allow an unrestricted carbon flow. The well-known change of imported sucrose fate at the beginning of ripening from accumulation of organic acid (malate) to hexoses (glucose and fructose) was well correlated with a switch in abundance between sucrose synthase and soluble acid invertase. The role of the identified proteins is discussed in relation to their biological function, grape berry development, and to quality traits.

The mass spectrometry parameters were optimized for reliable quantification and the enhanced selectivity and sensitivity selected reaction monitoring mode (SRM) was applied. For extraction, the direct analysis of initial methanol extracts was compared with further ethyl acetate extraction. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this analytical method, serotonin, melatonin, trans- and cis-piceid, and trans- and cis-resveratrol from 24 kinds of commonly consumed fruits were quantified. The highest serotonin content was found in plantain, while orange bell peppers had the highest melatonin content. Grape samples possessed higher trans- and cis-piceid, and trans- and cis-resveratrol contents than the other fruits. The results indicate that the combination of HPLC-MS detection and simple sample preparation allows the rapid and accurate quantification of serotonin, melatonin, trans- and cis-piceid, and trans- and cis-resveratrol in fruits.",Journal of chromatography.

These volatile compounds are produced on grapes by Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium expansum and/or a combination of P. expansum and B. cinerea strains. B. cinerea strains were isolated from different (a) vineyards in Spain and Portugal, (b) grape varieties (c) bunches (i.e., sound and botrytized) and (d) positions in the botrytized bunch (i.e., interior or exterior). A novel Headspace-Phase Microextraction (SPME) followed by Gas Chromatrography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) dedicated to analyze geosmin, methylisoborneol (MIB), 1-octen-3-ol, fenchone and fenchol in grape broth medium was used. Approximately 50% of the B. cinerea strains induced detectable geosmin. One strain accumulated significant amounts of anisoles, demonstrating that this contamination might already occur in the vineyard.

Removal of 50% of clusters was performed at 40 days (T1), 80 days (T2), and 100 days after flowering (T3) in a vineyard located in southern Mendoza (Argentina). Yield components, with the exception of cluster weight, were significantly affected by CT in both seasons, but no statistically significant differences were found among treatments. Cluster thinning and its timing had little or no influence on physical parameters and fruit chemical composition, and the differences with respect to the control were mainly due to the season. At harvest in 2008, T1 encouraged the biosynthesis of individual anthocyanins in skins, generating 44.0, 39.6, and 41.2% more glucosylated, acetylated, and total anthocyanins, respectively, as compared to the control, whereas in seeds, T1 and T2 mainly changed the concentrations of (+)-catechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, procyanidin B4, dimer gallate 1, trimer gallate 2, and tetramer. Conversely in 2009, T1 significantly affected the content of flavanols and flavonols in skins, whereas in seeds, T1 and T2 modified the level of (+)-catechin, procyanidins B4 and B6, and trimer gallate 2. Moreover, in 2008 the grapes had a higher concentration of most phenolic compounds, indicating a greater potential for more complex wines. Finally, dihydroquercetin-3-glucoside was the major compound among all nonanthocyanin phenolics detected in Malbec skins and represented 25.7% (2008) and 39.9% (2009) of the total content of those compounds at harvest.

Rotundone levels up to 1.91 μg/kg were also found in clones of Gruener Veltliner, a white grape variety known to give 'peppery' wines. These concentrations are higher than those reported for Syrah grapes and are similar to the levels found in some plants. Rotundone was shown to accumulate almost exclusively in berry exocarp, suggesting that skin contact during winemaking could be used to modulate the peppery character of red wine. However, rotundone yield after the winemaking process was relatively low.

21505870,"One of characteristics of diabetes mellitus (DM) is endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and apoptosis which contributes to the development of vasculopathy. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) continuously produced in the setting of DM play an important role in causing EC dysfunction and apoptosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive. Lactadherin, a secreted glycoprotein of milk-fat globule, is expressed by multiple cell types of arterial wall including ECs. Our previous proteomic studies showed that the expression of lactadherin was significantly increased in the aorta of diabetic rats as compared with control rats and treatment with grape seed procyanidin extracts significantly inhibited the lactadherin expression in diabetic rats. We hypothesized that lactadherin plays a critical role in AGEs-induced EC apoptosis; grape seed procyanidin B2 (GSPB2) and resveratrol protect against AGEs-induced EC apoptosis through lactadherin regulation. Our results showed that AGEs upregulated lactadherin expression and lactadherin RNA interference significantly attenuated AGEs-induced EC apoptosis. Overexpression of lactadherin increased EC apoptosis with up-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation suggesting the involvement of mitochondria apoptosis pathway. Mechanistically, overexpression of lactadherin reduced the phosphorylation of GSK3beta at baseline. Our study also revealed nine proteins interacting with lactadherin in HUVEC and study of these candidate proteins could unveil further underlying molecular mechanisms. In summary, our study identified lactadherin as a key player responsible for AGEs-induced EC apoptosis and antioxidants GSPB2 and resveratrol protect against AGEs-induced EC apoptosis by inhibiting lactadherin.

In the present study, three monoclonal antibodies with different affinities to this modern strobilurin have been evaluated for their usefulness in the production of immunoaffinity columns suitable for the solid-phase extraction, concentration, and clean-up of residues from food commodities. Different immunosorbents were produced and characterized in terms of antibody immobilization efficiency, immunosorbent binding capacity, optimum elution conditions, and reusability. Covalent coupling of the antibodies to Sepharose-CNBr gel took place with high yield (over 90%), whereas the immunosorbent efficacy to retain the analyte (from 28 to 68%) was shown to depend on the amount and type of antibody immobilized on the support. As a matter of fact, columns prepared with the monoclonal antibody PYs5#14 were able to selectively bound up to 53 μg of pyraclostrobin per gram of beads. Acetonitrile solutions were preferred over methanolic ones for analyte elution, and some immunosorbents could be reused at least 4-6 times provided that the amount of pyraclostrobin and the volume of sample did not overload the column. Effectiveness of the selected immunoaffinity column was evidenced by the development of an extraction procedure for pyraclostrobin residues from fruit juices and further determination by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. A concentration factor of 50 times was achieved with the developed immunoaffinity column, which eventually resulted in a limit of quantification of 0.01 mg L(-1).

The main isoforms of these two proteins from Chardonnay grape juice were thus purified by liquid chromatography. Two fast protein liquid chromatography (FLPC) steps allowed the fractionation and purification of the juice proteins, using cation exchange and hydrophobic interaction media. A further high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) step was used to achieve higher purity levels. Fraction assessment was achieved by mass spectrometry. Fraction purity was determined by HPLC to detect the presence of protein contaminants, and by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect the presence of organic contaminants. Once pure fractions of lyophilized chitinase and thaumatin-like protein were obtained, ultra-HPLC (UHPLC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) calibration curves were constructed. The quantification of these proteins in different grape juice and wine samples was thus achieved for the first time with both techniques through comparison with the purified protein calibration curve.

The limit of quantitation of 40 ng/L was achieved with excellent precision using stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) combined with headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) of derivatized 3-MH. This method was used in combination with HPLC-MS/MS analysis of the individual diastereomers of 3-S-cysteinylhexan-1-ol (Cys-3-MH) and 3-S-glutathionylhexan-1-ol (Glut-3-MH), which are known precursors of the volatile thiol 3-MH. Commercial and small-lot winemaking trials were evaluated to determine the concentrations of precursors and free 3-MH at various stages of grape processing and winemaking. Five Sauvignon blanc clones were also assessed for precursors and free thiol during ripening, revealing the presence of 3-MH in the unfermented juices and a stark increase in precursor concentrations in the latter stage of ripening. Additionally, differences due to sample freezing and mode of juice preparation were revealed for the precursors, and a set of commercially available wines was analyzed to investigate the amounts of precursors and free 3-MH in Sauvignon blanc and other white wine varieties. There was seemingly no relationship between precursor concentrations in juice and 3-MH concentrations in wine.

21428068,"The purpose was to achieve the identification of Muscat Hamburg wines produced in Tianjin region through scanning and analyzing dry white wine samples of different grape varieties and regions by infrared spectroscopy technology. A support vector machine (SVM) based method was introduced to analyze infrared spectra of dry white wines. The pretreatment processes of the IR spectra were also elaborated, including baseline adjustment, noise Elimination, standard normalization and eliminating the main component of abnormal sample points. The authors selected great quantity of dry white wine samples of different grape regions including 511 Muscat Hamburg wine samples, 438 Italian Riesling wine samples, 307 Chardonnay wine samples, 29 Ugni Blanc wine samples, 44 Rkatsiteli wine samples, 31 longan wine samples and 79 ZeHong wine samples. According to different classification problems, 80% of IR spectra of the wine samples were used to establish discrimination models with SVM-based method, and the remaining 20% of IR spectra were used for the validation of the discrimination models. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is effective, since high classification accuracy, identification rate and rejecting rate were achieved: over 97% for the white wine samples of different grape varieties, meanwhile over 98% for the Muscat Hamburg wine samples produced in different regions. So the method developed in this paper played a good role in the qualitative classification and discrimination of Muscat Hamburg wines produced in Tianjin region. This novel method has a considerable potential and a rosy application future due to the expeditiousness, stability and easy-operation of FTIR method, as well as the veracity and credibility of SVM method.",Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu,"['D013055', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",[SVM-based qualitative analysis of Muscat Hamburg wine produced in Tianjin region].,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21428068,2014

The effect of sour rot was tested in monovarietal wines produced with the Portuguese red grape variety Trincadeira and in blends of Cabernet Sauvignon and sour rotten Trincadeira grapes. Wines produced from damaged berries exhibited clear honey-like notes not evoked by healthy samples. Ethyl phenylacetate (EPhA) and phenylacetic acid (PAA), both exhibiting sweet honey-like aromas, emerged as key aroma compounds of sour rotten wines. Their levels were 1 order of magnitude above those found in controls and reached 304 and 1668 μg L(-1) of EPhA and PAA, respectively, well above the corresponding odor thresholds. Levels of γ-nonalactone also increased by a factor 3 in sour rot samples. Results also suggest that sour rot exerts a great effect on the secondary metabolism of yeast, decreasing the levels of volatiles related to fatty acids and amino acid synthesis.

In this study, histamine and other biogenic amines were determined by HPLC after amine derivatisation to dansyl chloride conjugates in 100 selected high-quality red wines made from seven different cultivars. Amine levels varied considerably between different wines. The most abundant amines were putrescine (median = 19.4 mg l(-1), range = 2.9-122), histamine (7.2 mg l(-1), 0.5-26.9), and tyramine (3.5 mg l(-1), 1.1-10.7), whereas lower levels were found for isoamylamine (median = 0.25 mg l(-1)), phenylethylamine (0.16 mg l(-1)), cadaverine (0.58 mg l(-1)), spermidine (1.8 mg l(-1)) and tryptamine (0.06 mg l(-1)). Positive correlations were observed between isoamylamine and phenylethylamine, and between histamine, putrescine and tyramine levels. Amine concentrations were similar in all wine cultivars except Pinot noir and St. Laurent wines, which showed significantly higher tryptamine and cadaverine levels. The results indicate that levels of histamine and other biogenic amines may vary considerably between red wines independent of grape variety and that high amounts can also be found in high-rated wines. Adopting a legal histamine threshold level of 10 mg l(-1) in the European Union, as formerly introduced in other countries, would have excluded 34% of the investigated wines from the market.","Food additives & contaminants.

Vines in vineyards with white and red grapes located in Central Greece were sprayed once with commercial formulations of each insecticide at the recommended doses in experiments carried out in 2004 and repeated in 2006. The insecticide residues in grapes showed slow reduction for a period of 42 days after application following first-order kinetics with dissipation rates ranged from 0.011 to 0.018 mg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹. However, at the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) residues did not exceed 0.27 ± 0.03 mg kg⁻¹ for flufenoxuron and lufenuron and 0.68 ± 0.07 mg kg⁻¹ for tebufenozide, and they were clearly lower than the maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by the European Union for grape (2 mg kg⁻¹ for flufenoxuron, 1 mg kg⁻¹ for lufenuron and 3 mg kg⁻¹ for tebufenozide). Grape processing into wine caused an almost complete reduction for flufenoxuron and lufenuron as their residues in wine were below the method LOQs (<0.01 mg l⁻¹), but only a moderate reduction for tebufenozide with concentrations from 0.13 to 0.26 mg l⁻¹ measured in the produced wines. Mean transfer factors for tebufenozide of 0.45 for white 'Roditis' and 0.34 for red 'Cabernet Sauvignon' were found from grapes into wine for the wines processed without maceration.

We prepared grape seed extracts, from two different varieties, containing high amounts of polyphenols but little resveratrol. Their neuroprotective effects were investigated using primary culture of neonatal mouse hippocampal neurons treated with an excitotoxic concentration of glutamate. Koshu, a white, local variety of V. vinifera, alleviated the acute inactivation of Erk1/2 and dendrite retraction in cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to a toxic concentration of glutamate (1.0 ng/ml). By contrast, Muscat Bailey A, a red, hybrid variety (Muscat Humburg × Bailey), failed to show any neuroprotective effect. Unlike brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other neuroprotective cytokines, Koshu extract did not induce Akt phosphorylation. Koshu extract also augmented neuron survival rate 24 hours after glutamate toxicity. The comparison of polyphenols between the two samples by liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry demonstrated that Koshu had higher amounts of low molecular weight polyphenols along with several Koshu-specific procyanidin oligomers.

21238751,"For this work, thirteen types of fruit juices (orange, pineapple, peach, apple, multifruit, mango, strawberry, tomato, pear, mandarin, grape, banana and grapefruit) were selected to develop an analytical method for the analysis of 53 pesticides by direct injection in LC-MS/MS. The preparation of the samples was very simple: an aliquot of the juice was centrifuged and it was ten-times diluted prior to analysis, which allowed reducing considerably the time and cost of the analyses. Besides, dilution of the samples permits reducing the amount of matrix going into the system, and thus, decreasing the matrix effects, so common in this type of commodities, opening the possibility to perform quantification with solvent based standards. Validation of the method was carried out in accordance with EU guidelines. Calibration curves covering three orders of magnitude were performed, and they were linear over the concentration range studied for all the matrices (from 0.1 to 100 μg L(-1)). Practical limits of quantification were in the low μg L(-1) range, far below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) of the EU regulations, which do not set specific MRLs for juices, and in this cases of processed food, MRLs of the raw product are applied. Repeatability of the instrumental method was studied in all matrices, obtaining good intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs). The proposed method was applied to 106 real fruit juice samples purchased in different local markets during a one-year survey in order to validate the suitability for routine analysis. 43% of the analysed samples gave positive results (higher than the practical limits of quantification).",Talanta,"['D001628', 'D002853', 'D005060', 'D005638', 'D010573', 'D010865', 'D053719']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Europe', 'Fruit', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Pilot Projects', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Pesticide residue analysis of fruit juices by LC-MS/MS direct injection.

We carried out a comparative 2-DE analysis of grape skins collected in three moments of ripening and analyzed the spot volume dataset through the application of principal component analysis followed by forward stepwise-linear discriminant analysis. This technique allowed to discriminate véraison, quite mature and mature samples, and to sort the matched spots according to their significance. We identified 36 spots showing high discriminating coefficients through liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Most of them were involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses indicating these enzymes as good candidate markers of berry ripening. These evidences hint at a likely developmental role of these proteins, in addition to their reported activity in stress events. Restricting the same statistical analysis to the samples belonging to the two last stages, it was indicated that this approach can clearly distinguish these close and similar phases of berry development.

The presence of ethanol in the model wine sample matrix resulted in decreased sensitivity of the method toward most of the volatile constituents. Mean percent relative recoveries and reproducibilities (%CV) were 22.8% and 7.1%, respectively, compared with 28.4% and 8.5% for model grape juice. The mean limit of detection (LoD) ratio (juice:wine) was 0.25. Similar sensitivities for the two sample matrices using this method were achieved by changing the split ratio from 20:1 (grape juice) to 5:1 (wine), giving a mean limit of detection ratio (juice:wine) of 1.0, thus allowing direct comparison of chromatograms of volatile components in the two matrices. This enabled direct comparisons of grape juices and the wines derived from them by alcoholic yeast fermentation. The influence of ethanol concentration in the range 9-15% on method sensitivity is discussed, using an overlay of the total ion chromatograms.

The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) develop a procedure using headspace solid phase micro-extraction combined with GC-MS in the selected ion monitoring mode (HS-SPME-GC-MS-SIM) for analysis of MIBP in grape berries, and (2) determine the location of MIBP biosynthesis in grapevines by approach grafting clusters of Vitis vinifera L. cvs Cabernet Sauvignon and Muscat blanc onto each other. The soluble solids and pH of the grape juice/homogenate matrix from different grape berry developmental stages influenced the method precision; therefore, quantification via the method of standard addition was used. Using our developed method, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of MIBP were 0.1 ng L(-1) and 2 ng L(-1), respectively, measured in a model juice and non-MIBP containing Chardonnay juice. Spiked recoveries averaged between 91% and 112% in Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir homogenates and the overall relative standard deviation was less than 10%. The method was used to analyze MIBP in 29 grape cultivars and in fruit from clusters grafted to Cabernet Sauvignon or Muscat vines. Quantifiable levels were found only in Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc and Semillon, providing information on the genetic connection for the occurrence of MIBP in grapes. No MIBP was detected in the berries of Muscat blanc clusters grafted onto Cabernet Sauvignon vines when sampled at fruit maturity. MIBP was detected in all berries of Cabernet Sauvignon regardless the graft configuration. The data indicate that MIBP or its precursors originate in the berry and its formation depends upon grape genotype.",Phytochemistry,"['D002212', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D015394', 'D009812', 'D011719', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Capsicum', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Odorants', 'Pyrazines', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",2-Methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine in grape berries and its dependence on genotype.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20965529,2011

In the present work, the main secondary grape metabolites of Raboso varieties were studied, and their enological potential was evaluated and compared with that of other red varieties reported in the literature. In general, Raboso grapes had high flavonoid contents and high percentages of polyphenols extractable in winemaking and substantial contents of norisoprenoid aroma precursors. Raboso Veronese stood out for its high content of cyanidin and had higher (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin contents than Raboso Piave and abundant quercetin glucoside, indicating substantial plant biosynthesis toward compounds dihydroxylated in the B-ring.

20942401,"Glutathione, a natural occurring antioxidant, is a thiol-containing peptide present in grape must and wine. It is able to regenerate the o-diphenol group of enzymatically oxidized trans-caftaric acid, giving rise to 2-S-glutathionyl-trans-caftaric acid (also known as grape reaction product, GRP) and thus inhibiting the browning of wine. The amount of GRP present in a wine provides information on the oxidation history of the wine over its elaboration and aging. GRP has been proved to suffer hydrolysis in model solutions and wines. To know the actual content of glutathione involved in white wine browning inhibition as GRP, the GRP-derived products have been studied in 1-year-aged white wines by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS(n). Online UV-vis spectra and pseudomolecular ions [(M + H)(+)] obtained by LC-MS supported the formation of some of the expected GRP hydrolysis products, mainly 2-S-glutathionyl-trans-caffeic acid (trans-GSCf), together with minor 2-S-(cysteinylglycyl)-trans-caftaric acid, 2-S-(γ-glutamylcysteinyl)-trans-caftaric acid, and 2-S-cysteinyl-trans-caftaric acid. On the basis of UV-vis and LC-MS(2) spectra, new GRP derivatives in aged white wines have been tentatively characterized for the first time as three monoethyl esters of GRP (GRP-Et) and also the cis isomers of GRP, GSCf, and some of the GRP-Et.

The producing subregions of Pinto Bandeira, Vale dos Vinhedos and Nova Pádua showed differences in the temperature, rainfall and humidity conditions used for the production under microvinification conditions of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties, in the harvests of 2005 and 2006. An isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to an elemental analyzer was used to measure the (13)C/(12)C of ethanol and the (18)O/(16)O of wine water. Regardless of the grape variety used, it was possible to determine the subregion through measurement of the δ(18)O values in both harvests. The altitudes of the different subregions led to statistical differences and demonstrated an influence mainly on the δ(18)O values of wine water. The δ(18)O value of wine water was determined to be more selective for the determination of the cultivation subregions than the δ(13)C value of the ethanol.

Pesticide loads did not affect the antimutagenic or antimicrobial properties of the extracts. Both extracts inhibited the growth of Gram-positive foodborne pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium to similar extents. Possibly as a result of higher amounts of quercetin and its derivatives, higher antimicrobial effects against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium were observed for the organic white grape skin extracts. Conventional or organic extracts did not show remarkable antimutagenic effects when tested against the mutagen IQ by means of the Ames test.

20843643,"N-glycans from plant and invertebrate allergens can induce extensive immunoglobulin-E (IgE) cross-reactivity in vitro. IgE antibodies against these N-glycans, also termed cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants or CCDs, are prevalent in alcohol drinkers. This study investigated the prevalence and biological significance of IgE antibodies to N-glycans from wine glycoproteins in heavy drinkers. A structured questionnaire, skin prick tests, serum IgE levels, IgE-immunoblotting to wine extracts, and basophil activation tests were used to characterize 20 heavy drinkers and 10 control subjects. Eleven heavy drinkers (55%) showed IgE binding to proteins in wine extracts. The proteins were identified by mass spectrometry as grape-derived vacuolar invertase and thaumatin-like protein. Immunoblot reactivity was closely associated with the presence of IgE to CCDs and was inhibited by preincubation with a glycoconjugate containing bromelain-type N-glycans. The same conjugate, CCD-bearing allergens, and wine extracts activated basophils in patients with high-titer CCD-specific IgE but not in healthy controls. There was no relationship between immunoblot reactivity and consumption of any specific type of wine. No patient reported symptoms of hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera venom, food, or wine. In conclusion, heavy drinkers frequently show IgE reactivity to the N-glycans of wine glycoproteins. Glycans and wine glycoprotein extracts can induce basophil activation in sensitized alcoholics.

Structural parameters of native (unoxidized) tannin polymers were derived from SAXS according to the wormlike chain model: the length per monomer is 15 A, the length of the statistical segment 17 A, and the cross section of the macromolecule has a radius within the range 3-4.5 A. The rather short length of the statistical segment is an effect of the different location of interflavanol linkages, which cause a loss of orientational correlation between successive monomers. Oxidation created new bonds that were resistant to thiolysis, and, according to thiolysis, some of these new bonds were intramolecular. However, according to SAXS, oxidation at high tannin concentration caused the weight average degree of polymerization to increase, indicating that intermolecular reactions took place as well, creating larger macromolecules. In the case of the smaller grape seed tannins, these intermolecular reactions took place ""end to end"" leading to the formation of longer linear macromolecules, at least in the earlier stages of oxidation. In the case of the larger apple tannins, the SAXS patterns were characteristic of larger branched macromolecules. Accordingly, the intermolecular reactions were mainly ""end to middle"".

From analytical point of view, it is important to unequivocally identify individual carotenoid compounds in many food stuffs. Therefore, isolation of standards from natural sources must be encouraged for accurate identifications. Like many fruits, mature grape berries contain numerous carotenoid compounds, mostly found in the skin at levels two to three times higher than in the pulp. Carotenoid compounds in a typical wine grape variety (Negroamaro) grown in Apulian region were investigated by reversed-phase C(30) (RP-30) HPLC-DAD-MS (ESI(+)) analysis. As a consequence of an unusual ionization process of carotenoids, their mass spectra registered in the positive ion mode comprised both protonated molecules and molecular ion radicals with little fragmentation. Additionally, selective collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments, together with fine structures of the UV-vis spectra, were used to differentiate structural and geometrical isomers.

Moreover, the use of UPLC technique allowed to determine the studied compounds at low concentration levels in a short analysis time (12.5 min approximately).

We hypothesized that IBMP is demethylated to 3-isobutyl-2-hydroxypyrazine (IBHP) during fruit maturation effectively reversing the final putative step of IBMP biosynthesis. A quantification method for IBHP was developed using solid-phase extraction coupled to one- or two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a recovery of ca. 80%. IBMP and IBHP in bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) and V. vinifera (cv. 'Cabernet Franc', 'Riesling', 'Pinot noir') were then measured at different maturities. IBMP and IBHP were inversely correlated in both bell peppers (R2=0.958) and Cabernet Franc grapes (R2=0.998) over a range of maturities. In bell peppers, we observed a significant decline in IBMP (125 to 15 ng/mL) and increase in IBHP (undetectable to 42 ng/mL) during ripening. In grapes, all cultivars had comparable IBHP concentrations preveraison (64 to 88 pg/mL) but differed in IBHP concentration by 2 orders of magnitude at the final sampling point (undetectable to 235 pg/mL). Higher preveraison IBMP was correlated with higher final IBHP across the three grape cultivars, with the order Cabernet Franc>Riesling>Pinot noir for both IBMP and IBHP.

C13-norisoprenoids were analyzed by GC-MS in the obtained wines from 2006 and 2007 vintages. Higher DeltaC values, found in Chardonnay and Merlot grapes, corresponded to higher norisoprenoid contents in the respective wines, particularly characterized by highly flavorant compounds such as beta-damascenone and 3-oxo-alpha-ionol. A linear regression was determined that was significant at the 0.01% level (F=36.12, p=0.00096) with R=0.9261, between grape DeltaC values and total norisoprenoid contents in wine.

20688332,"Anthocyanins, which confer the characteristic color to red wine, can be used as markers to classify wines according to the grape variety. It is a complex separation that requires very high chromatographic efficiency, especially in the case of aged red wines, due to the formation of pyranoanthocyanins. A coelution between these kinds of compounds can affect the R(ac/coum) ratio of aged wines, and might lead to false results when classifying the wine variety. In 2007, the use of a novel mixed-mode ion-exchange reversed-phase column was reported to separate anthocyanins extracted from grapes of Vitis labrusca with different selectivity than C-18 columns. In the present work, the separation of anthocyanins including pyranoanthocyanins in young and aged Cabernet Sauvignon wines and other varieties is evaluated. The most interesting contributions of this research are the different elution order and selectivity obtained for anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins (only formed in wine), compared with those observed in C-18 stationary phases. Also interesting is the separation of the polymeric fraction, which elutes as a clearly separated peak at the chromatogram's end. However, a comparison with a high efficiency C-18 column with the same dimensions and particle size demonstrated that the tested mixed-mode column shows broader peaks with a theoretical plate number below 8000, for malvidin-3-glucoside peak, while it can be up to 10 times higher for a high efficiency C-18 column, depending on the column manufacturer. Under the tested conditions, in mixed-mode phase, the analysis time is almost twice that of a C-18 column with the same dimensions and particle size. A mixed-mode phase with increased efficiency should provide an interesting perspective for separation of anthocyanins in wine, due to its improved selectivity, combined with a useful role in a second-dimension separation in preparative anthocyanin chromatography.",Journal of chromatography.

However, contamination with earthy odours may have occurred previously in the must and novel methods are required for this commodity. In the present report, several parameters of the SPME were evaluated to optimize geosmin extraction.

20582777,"Aspergillus carbonarius and A. niger aggregate are the main fungal contaminants of table grapes. Besides their ability to cause black rot, they can produce ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin that has attracted increasing attention worldwide. The objective of this work was to set up a simple and rapid molecular method for the early detection of both fungi in table grapes before fungal development becomes evident. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays were developed by designing species-specific primers based on the polyketide synthases (PKS(S)) sequences of A. carbonarius and A. niger that have recently been demonstrated to be involved in OTA biosynthesis. Three table grape varieties (Red globe, Crimson seedless, and Italia) were inoculated with A. carbonarius and A. niger aggregate strains producing OTA. The extracted DNA from control (non-inoculated) and inoculated grapes was amplified by PCR using ACPKS2F-ACPKS2R for A. carbonarius and ANPKS5-ANPKS6 for A. niger aggregate. Both primers allowed a clear detection, even in symptomless samples. PCR-based methods are considered to be a good alternative to traditional diagnostic means for the early detection of fungi in complex matrix for their high specificity and sensitivity.

20546421,"Carotenoid compounds in wine grapes (Chardonnay, Merlot, Primitivo, Negroamaro) grown in Apulian region were investigated by chromatographic and spectrometric analyses. Cis-isomers of lutein and beta-carotene (9Z, 9'Z-lutein and 9Z-beta-carotene) and 5,6-epoxyxanthophylls were detected: 9'Z-neoxanthin, violaxanthin, and 5,6-epoxylutein. Moreover, zeaxanthin was efficiently resolved from lutein by a selective factor > 1 (alpha= 1.06) and was found in high amounts (50 to 300 microg/kg) in the grape extracts analyzed in 3 y of study (2006 to 2008). At grape maturity, beta-carotene had concentration approximately 2-to 4-fold higher than (all-E)-lutein in all varieties. Because carotenoids are potential precursors of aroma compounds, it was determined carotenoids change DeltaC (microg/kg), from the difference of total carotenoids concentration between veraison and maturity. Chardonnay and Merlot had the highest DeltaC values and principal component analysis showed that they were characterized by 5,6-epoxyxanthophylls derivatives and zeaxanthin, lutein, and beta-carotene derivatives, respectively. An important effect of vintage on DeltaC values in the analyzed grapes was also observed. A strong positive correlation was determined between DeltaC and temperature data that seem to be responsible for the difference of DeltaC in the Chardonnay and Merlot compared to the Primitivo and Negroamaro varieties.",Journal of food science,"['D001628', 'D002338', 'D002734', 'D002851', 'D004040', 'D005638', 'D006863', 'D007536', 'D007558', 'D014975', 'D025341', 'D013045', 'D021241', 'D027843', 'D014887', 'D014920', 'D024341', 'D019207']","['Beverages', 'Carotenoids', 'Chlorophyll', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dietary Carbohydrates', 'Fruit', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Isomerism', 'Italy', 'Lutein', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Species Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Vitis', 'Weather', 'Wine', 'Xanthophylls', 'beta Carotene']",Carotenoid and chlorophyll-derived compounds in some wine grapes grown in Apulian region.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000031', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000031']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'analogs & derivatives']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20546421,2010

20492283,"The disruption of plant cell walls during fruit juice processing results in the enzymatic formation of herbaceous-smelling green leaf volatiles (GLVs). Our objective was to assess the impact of thermal processing conditions on resulting levels of GLVs (hexanal, trans-2-hexenal, hexanol, cis-3-hexenol, and trans-2-hexenol), total phenols, monomeric anthocyanins, and percent polymeric color in Concord grape juice. The effects of fruit maturity and stage of juice processing on juice GLV content was also assessed. Of the GLVs studied, only trans-2-hexenal routinely exceeded its published sensory threshold in finished juice. We observed an inverse linear correlation between berry maturity (total soluble solids) and trans-2-hexenal levels in finished juice (P < 0.05, R(2)= 0.91). Trans-2-hexenal was at a maximum immediately following crushing (569 microg/kg, >30-fold over detection threshold [DT]), decreased to 100 microg/kg following depectinization, pressing, and pasteurization, and to 32 microg/kg following cold-stabilization. The loss of trans-2-hexenal could be explained primarily by its reduction to trans-2-hexenol, which increased from 53 microg/kg after crushing to 500 microg/kg after cold-stabilization. High temperature pretreatment of must immediately following crushing (""hot break"") resulted in 5- to 6-fold higher concentrations of trans-2-hexenal in the final bottled juice as compared to conventional hot press. Contrary to expectations, no significant increase in phenolics and anthocyanins were observed in hot break conditions. These results indicate that hot break procedures may thermally inactivate enzymes responsible for transforming trans-2-hexenal under normal processing conditions and potentially alter the flavor qualities of the finished Concord juice. Different equivalent pasteurization regimes (82 to 93 degrees C) prior to bottling had no significant effect on GLV content of the finished Concord juices (P > 0.05).",Journal of food science,"['D000383', 'D000447', 'D000465', 'D000872', 'D001628', 'D005525', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D000441', 'D006863', 'D009812', 'D010636', 'D010858', 'D013696', 'D013997', 'D027843', 'D055549']","['Agriculture', 'Aldehydes', 'Algorithms', 'Anthocyanins', 'Beverages', 'Food-Processing Industry', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hexanols', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Odorants', 'Phenols', 'Pigmentation', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Vitis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Impact of harvesting and processing conditions on green leaf volatile development and phenolics in Concord grape juice.,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","['methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20492283,2010

20492096,"The effect of the addition of 2 enzymatic preparations and the application of a pulsed electric fields treatment (PEF) on the phenolic content and color of Cabernet Sauvignon wine has been compared. The evolution of color intensity (CI), anthocyanic content (AC), and total polyphenol index (TPI) from crushing to 3 mo of aging in bottle was studied. The results demonstrated that both treatments promoted greater extraction of phenolic compounds, compared to the untreated wine. However, PEF technology was more effective. After 3 mo of storage, CI, AC, and TPI were 28%, 26%, and 11%, respectively, higher in PEF-wine than in control wine. By contrast, while both enzymatic preparations increased the CI of the wine around 5%, only one of them increased the AC and TPI by 11% and 3%, respectively, in comparison with the control. After 3 mo of aging in bottle, the phenolic composition was also analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The content of nonanthocyanic families was higher in PEF-wine than in the rest of the wines. In wines treated by enzymes, only an increase in phenolic acids and flavonols with respect to the control was detected.

These compounds perform a wide range of crucial functions in biological systems and are of great interest for the pharmaceutical and food industries. In this work, the binding mode of the natural polyphenolic compounds from grape seed on the porcine pancreatic elastase surface was studied by experimental and computational methods. Fluorescence quenching, circular dichroism, nephelometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS), molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation studies were performed. A decrease in fluorescence intensities was observed with addition of increasing polyphenol concentrations. The order of binding ability obtained was oligomeric fraction of procyanidins (OFP) > tetramer > trimer > dimer B3 procyanidins. Thus a relationship between higher molecular weight and binding ability was observed. The interaction between these molecules and the enzyme occurs by a static mechanism, as inferred from the high apparent fluorescence and bimolecular quenching constants. A blue shift in the maximal emission wavelength could be seen, which indicates that the tryptophan residues acquire a more hydrophobic character upon procyanidin binding. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations also demonstrate that the SASA (solvent-accessible surface area) values of tryptophans decrease with the binding of these compounds, preventing the accessibility of water molecules, which agrees with the referred blue shift. Circular dichroism studies indicate a decrease in alpha-helix content, followed by an increase in the beta-sheet component of secondary structures of this enzyme.

The method involves extraction of a 10 g sample with 10 mL ethyl acetate, cleanup by dispersive SPE with primary-secondary amine (25 mg) sorbent, and estimation by GC/MS/MS large volume injection (LVI) through a programmed temperature vaporizer (PTV) injector. The PTV-LVI parameters of the gas chromatograph and the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) parameters of the ion trap mass spectrometer were optimized for each compound to achieve the highest SIN. For each analyte, the unique and most abundant MRM transition was used for quantification, along with the next most abundant MRM transition for confirmatory identification. The abundance ratio of the confirmatory to quantifier MRMs was used to ensure unambiguous residue monitoring in unknown samples within a 20% tolerance range at the 10 ng/g level. The analytes were separated on a TR-5MS capillary column within a 22 min run time. The method was selective and sensitive and ensured separation of the synthetic pyrethroids from high-boiling matrix components. The LOD and LOQ of the analytes ranged between 0.5 to 3.1 and 2.5 to 10 ng/g, respectively.

In fact, they are involved among others in white wine turbidity, organoleptic characteristics and foam formation in sparkling wines. These compounds could also be of major interest for varietal differentiation, regarding wine authentication and traceability issues. To provide a better understanding of the role played by these biomolecules in wine processing and explore their potential applications, there is a manifest need for the quantification and characterization of each individual one in terms of sequence, structure and intrinsic and functional properties. We thus present an overview of preparative and analytical methods for the study of proteins in grape juices and wines, from routine techniques to dedicated methodologies. They include sample preparation with chromatographic methods for the purification and identification of proteins, quantification protocols and characterization procedures such as electrophoretic techniques, immunological methods, sequencing, mass spectrometry, physico-chemical and structural analyses, and so on. We expose advantages and limits of each technique and focus on the different but complementary information they can provide. Despite the past years advances in the field proteins identification, the elucidation of the full protein profile for grape juices and wines remains strenuous. Their interactions with other wine compounds make the challenge even harder.

20435757,"Existing methods for detection of food-borne pathogens and their toxins are frequently time-consuming, require specialized equipment, and involve lengthy culture procedures and/or animal testing and are thus unsuitable for a rapid response to an emergency public health situation. A series of simple and rapid affinity immunochromatography column (AICC) assays were developed to detect Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin types A, B, E, and F and Escherichia coli O157 in food matrices. Specifically, for milk, grape juice with peach juice, and bottled water, the detection limit for the botulinum neurotoxin type A complex was 0.5 ng. Use of this method with a 10-ml sample would therefore result in a detection limit of 50 pg ml(-l). Thus, this assay is approximately 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive than a comparable lateral-flow assay. For botulinum neurotoxin complex types B, E, and F, the minimum detection limit was 5 ng to 50 ng. Sensitive detection of E. coli O157 was achieved, and the detection limit was 500 cells. The AICC test was also shown to be specific, rapid, and user friendly. This test takes only 15 to 30 min to complete without any specialized equipment and thus is suitable for use in the field.

In the analysed samples, the following genera of toxigenic fungi were identified in the range of 1-4%: Aspergillus, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Penicillium, Rhizopus, Ulocladium, and Trichoderma Trichothecium, while the genera Aspergillus, Alternaria, Fusarium, and Penicillium were in the range 11-29%. A. niger, A. carbonarius, some strains of A. carbonarius-with 'crystals' and strains of A. uvarum-uniseriate were identified; these species are considered ochratoxigenic (able to produce variable amounts of toxins). In addition, a non-ochratoxigenic strain of A. ibericus and a Fusarium strain able to biosynthesize small amount of fumonisins, beauvericin, and enniatins were identified.

20301091,"The potential of three mass spectrometry (MS) analyzers (triple quadrupole, QqQ; time of flight, TOF; and quadrupole time of flight, QTOF) has been investigated and compared for quantification, confirmation and screening purposes in pesticide residue analysis of fruit and vegetable samples. For this purpose, analytical methodology for multiresidue determination of 11 pesticides, taken as a model, has been developed and validated in nine food matrices for the three mass analyzers coupled to ultra high pressure liquid chromatography. In all cases, limits of quantification around 0.01 mg/kg were reached, fulfilling the most restrictive case of baby-food analysis. Regarding absolute sensitivity, the lower limits of detection were obtained, as expected, for QqQ (100 fg), whereas slightly higher limits (300 fg) were obtained for both TOF and QTOF. Confirmative capacity of each analyzer was studied for each analyte based on the identification points (IPs) criterion, useful for a comprehensive comparison. QTOF mass analyzer showed the highest confirmatory capacity, although QqQ normally led to sufficient number of IPs, even at lower concentration levels. The potential of TOF MS was also investigated for screening purposes. To this aim, around 50 commercial fruits and vegetables samples were analyzed, searching for more than 400 pesticides. TOF MS proved to be an attractive analytical tool for rapid detection and reliable identification of a large number of pesticides thanks to the full spectrum acquisition at accurate mass with satisfactory sensitivity. This process is readily boosted when combined with specialized software packages, together with theoretical exact mass databases. Several pesticides (e.g. carbendazim in citrus and indoxacarb in grape) were detected in the samples.

20237919,"A multi-residue method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of around 130 multiclass pesticides in orange, nectarine and spinach samples by GC-MS/MS with a triple quadrupole analyzer. Compounds have been selected from different chemical families including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and acaricides. Three isotopically labeled standards have been used as surrogates in order to improve accurate quantitation. Samples were extracted by using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) with ethyl acetate. In the case of spinach, an additional clean-up step by gel permeation chromatography was applied. Determination was performed by GC-MS/MS in electron ionization mode acquiring two MS/MS transitions for each analyte. The intensity ratio between quantitation transition (Q) and identification transition (q) was used as confirmatory parameter (Q/q ratio). Accuracy and precision were evaluated by means of recovery experiments in orange, nectarine, and spinach samples spiked at two concentration levels (0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg). Recoveries were, in most cases, between 70% and 120% and RSD were below 20%. The limits of quantification objective for which the method was satisfactorily validated in the three samples matrices were for most pesticides 0.01 mg/kg. Matrix effects over the GC-MS/MS determination were tested by comparison of reference standards in pure solvent with matrix-matched standards of each matrix. Data obtained showed enhancement of signal for the majority of analytes in the three matrices investigated. Consequently, in order to reduce the systematic error due to this effect, quantification was performed using matrix-matched standard calibration curves.

A headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatographic (HS-SPME-GC) procedure was used to determine the volatile compounds and a blind analysis based on Ac/Ais (peak area of volatile compound/peak area of internal standard) was carried out for statistical purposes. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA) and stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) were used to process data and to develop discriminant models. Only 11 peaks enabled to differentiate and classify the experimental wines. SLDA allowed 100% recognition ability for three grape varieties, 100% prediction ability for Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Gernischt wines, but only 92.31% for Merlot wines. A more valid and robust way was to use the PCA scores to do the discriminant analysis. When we performed SLDA this way, 100% recognition ability and 100% prediction ability were obtained. At last, 11 peaks which selected by SLDA from raw analysis set had been identified. When we demonstrated the models using commercial wines, the models showed 100% recognition ability for the wines collected directly from winery and without ageing, but only 65% for the others.

The analytes were extracted from must using a cation exchange resin and purified on C18 cartridges. They were chromatographically separated on a reverse phase column and finally analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry in selected reaction monitoring mode (SRM) using deuterated analogues as standards except for glutathionylated conjugate of 4MMP which was analyzed by external calibration. The method was validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization recommendations by determining linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect, repeatability, intermediate reproducibility, LODs and LOQs. Calibration for each precursor was determined by performing Lack-of-Fit test and the best fitting for 3MH precursors was a quadratic model whereas a linear model was better adapted for 4MMP precursors. All calibration curves showed quite satisfactory correlation coefficients (R(2)>0.995 for SIDA quantification and R(2)>0.985 for external calibration). Quantification by SIDA and external calibration allowed a high level of accuracy since the averaged value ranged from 80 to 108%. Quantification of aroma precursors was accurate and reproducible over five days since intermediate precision (same analyst, same sample and same apparatus), which was evaluated by the calculation of RSD was inferior to 16%.

In this work, procyanidins were extracted with methanol and acetone/water from the seeds of white and red grape varieties. A fractionation by graded methanol/chloroform precipitations allowed to obtain 26 samples that were characterised using thiolysis as pre-treatment followed by HPLC-UV and MS detection. The average degree of polymerisation (DPn) of the procyanidins in the samples ranged from 2 to 11 flavan-3-ol residues. FTIR spectroscopy within the wavenumbers region of 1800-700 cm(-1) allowed to build a partial least squares (PLS1) regression model with 8 latent variables (LVs) for the estimation of the DPn, giving a RMSECV of 11.7%, with a R(2) of 0.91 and a RMSEP of 2.58. The application of orthogonal projection to latent structures (O-PLS1) clarifies the interpretation of the regression model vectors. Moreover, the O-PLS procedure has removed 88% of non-correlated variations with the DPn, allowing to relate the increase of the absorbance peaks at 1203 and 1099 cm(-1) with the increase of the DPn due to the higher proportion of substitutions in the aromatic ring of the polymerised procyanidin molecules.",Analytica chimica acta,"['D044946', 'D002138', 'D002392', 'D002725', 'D002851', 'D005612', 'D016018', 'D000432', 'D011108', 'D025341', 'D044945', 'D015203', 'D012639', 'D012995', 'D017550', 'D027843']","['Biflavonoids', 'Calibration', 'Catechin', 'Chloroform', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Freeze Drying', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Methanol', 'Polymers', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Seeds', 'Solubility', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Vitis']",Application of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and orthogonal projections to latent structures/partial least squares regression for estimation of procyanidins average degree of polymerisation.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20113728,2010

20103162,"Sweet wines made from botrytized grapes contain much higher concentrations of volatile thiols, especially 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3SH), than dry white wines. Three new specific volatile thiols (3-sulfanylpentan-1-ol (3SP), 3-sulfanylheptan-1-ol (3SHp), and 2-methyl-3-sulfanylbutan-1-ol (2M3SB) were recently identified in Sauternes wines. Like most volatile thiols, these compounds were almost totally absent from must, mainly being formed during alcoholic fermentation. In this work, we describe the identification and quantification of three new cysteine-S-conjugate precursors in must made from Botrytis-infected grapes. S-3-(pentan-1-ol)-L-cysteine (P-3SP), S-3-(heptan-1-ol)-L-cysteine (P-3SHp), and S-3-(2-methylbutan-1-ol)-L-cysteine (P-2M3SB) were identified by direct GC-MS analysis of their derivative forms obtained by silylation of an enriched fraction, isolated from must by affinity chromatography. Concentrations were considerably higher when Botrytis cinerea had developed on the grapes. In botrytized must, the mean levels of P-3SP, P-3SHp, and P-2M3SB were in the vicinity of 700, 50, and 500 nM, respectively, whereas concentrations in healthy must ranged from 0 to 50 nM. This indicated that these three new sulfanyl alcohols, responsible for the characteristic aroma of botrytized wines, were formed by the yeast metabolism during alcoholic fermentation from the corresponding non-volatile cysteine-S-conjugate precursors.

20103161,"Phenolic compounds, extractable from grape skins and seeds, have a notable influence on the quality of red wines. Many studies have clearly demonstrated the relationship between the phenolic composition of the grape at harvest time and its influence on the phenolic composition of the red wine produced. In many previous works the evolution of phenolic composition and relative extractability was normally studied on grapes sampled at different times during ripening, but at the same date the physiological characteristics of grape berries in a vineyard are often very heterogeneous. Therefore, the main goal of the study is to investigate the differences among mechanical properties, phenolic composition and relative extractability of Vitis vinifera L. cv Barbera grape berries, harvested at the same date from several vineyards, and calibrated according to their density at three levels of soluble solids (A=235+/-8, B=252+/-8 and C=269+/-8 g L(-1) sugar) with the aim of studying the influence of ripeness stages and growing locations on these parameters. Results on mechanical properties showed that the thickness of the berry skin (Sp(sk)) was the parameter most affected by the different level of sugars in the pulp, while different skin hardnesses, evaluated by the break skin force (F(sk)), were related to the cultivation sites. The latter were also observed to influence the mechanical characteristics of seeds. Generally, the anthocyanin content increased with the level of soluble solids, while the increase in the tannin content of the berry skin and seeds was less marked. However, significant changes in flavanols reactive to vanillin in the seeds were found.

Polyphenolic compounds are responsible for the colour of the fruit, juice and wine, and also act as very important natural antioxidant compounds. Dehydration is a method used to prevent the damage of these compounds over time. Nevertheless, in the case of volatile compounds, removing water can cause compound degradation or the evaporation of such compounds. This work studied two drying methods, freeze-drying and oven-drying, at 60 degrees C, as skin preservation methods. The skins from two grape varieties, Carménère and Cabernet Sauvignon, were dried.

The aim of this work was to determine the effect of the incorporation of the Graciano variety on the colour and pigment composition of Tempranillo based wine and to evaluate the possible differences between blending Tempranillo with Graciano varietal wine (W wine) in contrast to a wine obtained by mixing these two grape varieties in the prefermentative maceration step (M wine). Results indicated that pigment extraction and retention in M wine was higher than in Tempranillo (T) wine. Colour differences (DeltaE(ab)(*)) between wines at the end of the study (after 12 months in bottles) were detectable by the human eye (DeltaE(ab)(*) > or = 3) in all cases except for T and W. These wines have indistinguishable colours even when using analytical methods (DeltaE(ab)(*) < or = 1). Regarding hue h(ab), T and W presented higher values (more orange-red) than Graciano (G) and M (more blue-red).

20103139,"The aim of this work has been to determine the correlations between sensory analysis, colour and content of main flavanols present in seeds. For this, the flavanic composition of grape seeds with different degrees of maturity was analysed by HPLC-DAD-MS and the obtained results were correlated with CIELab colour parameters, perceived colour (C), hardness of the seed (HS), tannic intensity (TI) and astringency (A). Multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) with the variables showing significant correlations (p<0.05) was also performed. Grape seeds undergo important decreases in the content of catechins and procyanidin oligomers during ripening. Epicatechin-(4-8)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (B2G) and (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (ECG) are the flavanolic compounds whose contents decrease most. The changes in the phenolic composition accompany changes in TI, A and HS. The total content of flavanols in the seed is not the only factor affecting these attributes, since samples containing higher contents in flavanols can exhibit less astringency and tannic intensity than others with lower ones. The qualitative profile of the seeds is, therefore, also responsible for the sensations elicited in the mouth. A and HS parameters are more affected by the presence of galloylated dimeric procyanidins in the molecule than TI. CIELab colour parameters of seeds have high correlation coefficients with many flavanolic compounds.

20103129,"Several wavelength variable selection algorithms were compared to analyze visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectra for the non-invasive quantitative determination of soluble solids content (SSC) and pH in grape juice. In order to eliminate useless variables and improve the signal/noise ratio, the pretreated full spectra were firstly calculated by different informative variable selection methods. Uninformation variable elimination (UVE) did better than interval partial least squares (iPLS), synergy interval partial least squares (siPLS) and backward interval partial least squares (biPLS). Successive projections algorithm (SPA) was further operated to select variables. Finally, nine and eleven variables were obtained for respectively SSC and pH analyses. The better results of UVE-SPA-PLS models compared to those of SPA-PLS models in both SSC and pH analyses show that it is necessary to execute UVE before SPA, which can both reduce the calculation time and increase the model's performance. Furthermore, two common used calibration methods, PLS and multiple linear regression (MLR), were compared. UVE-SPA-MLR obtained better results than UVE-SPA-PLS in both SSC and pH analyses. The coefficients of determination for prediction set (r(p)(2)) and residual predictive deviation (RPD) obtained by UVE-SPA-MLR are 0.979 and 6.971 for SSC, and 0.951 and 5.432 for pH.

20103126,"The hybrid grape cultivar Isabel (V. vinifera x V. labrusca) accounts for about 50% of Brazilian grape production. The anthocyanin composition of the Isabel grape is known, but there is no data for the red wines produced with it. By means of HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS(n) we have studied the most important low molecular phenolic compounds in Isabel red table wines (anthocyanins, pyranoanthocyanins, flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives) in order to look for differences between these and V. vinifera red wines, and also their antioxidant capacity using the DPPH method. The anthocyanins found in Isabel red wines are mainly based on malvidin and they were the expected 3-glucosides and the non-vinifera characteristic 3,5-diglucosides including several minor compounds, such as the newly reported cis isomer of malvidin 3-(6''-coumaroyl)-glucoside-5-glucoside. As also found in V. vinifera red wines, Isabel red wines contain pyranoanthocyanins formed from anthocyanidin 3-glucosides during alcoholic fermentation and wine aging (vitisins A and B, and hydroxyphenyl-pyranoanthocyanins). The content of malvidin- and peonidin-based hydroxyphenyl-pyranoanthocyanins derived from p-coumaric and caffeic acids accounted importantly for the pool of low molecular red wine pigments in Isabel wines. The occurrence of other non-anthocyanin phenolic compounds, like hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and flavonols, are newly reported for Isabel red wines. In contrast to the differences found in the anthocyanins profiles, the flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives present in Isabel wines were the same as those in V. vinifera red wines. The content of flavonols is relatively low, but the content in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives is high in Isabel red wines.

The limit of quantification (LOQ) of most of the compounds was <or=10 ng g(-1) except for captan, captafol, and folpet, where the LOQ was <or=20 ng g(-1). For each analyte, the unique and most abundant MRM was selected for quantification, and the next most abundant for confirmation, with their abundance ratio being used for unambiguous identification of any detected pesticide in samples within 20% tolerance range at the LOQ level. Use of matrix-matched standards could minimize the matrix effect, which was lowest in grape, followed by pomegranate and mango. Recoveries ranged within 70-120% at 10, 20, and 50 ng g(-1) in all three matrixes with associated relative standard deviations <20% (n = 6). The method could be successfully applied to the screening of 100 farm samples for compliance to EU maximum residue limits.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D005638', 'D008401', 'D029561', 'D031022', 'D010573', 'D027843']","['Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Lythraceae', 'Mangifera', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Vitis']","Multiresidue analysis of 50 pesticides in grape, pomegranate, and mango by gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry.","['Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20020699,2010

The application of ethephon (2-chloroethylphosphonic acid), an ethylene-releasing compound, at 1% and 2% (w/w) in lanolin as well as ethylene induced gummosis in the bulbs within several days. Methyl jasmonate (JA-Me, 0.1-2% in lanolin) alone had no effect on gummosis. However, simultaneous application of JA-Me and ethephon led to extreme stimulation of ethephon-induced gummosis. Ethephon-induced gummosis in the bulbs depended on the maturation stage of the bulbs, increasing from April to July, but decreasing from August to September. Regardless of the presence of JA-Me, the application of ethephon to the inflorescence axis of grape hyacinths did not induce gummosis. Gel permeation chromatography analysis revealed that gums were homogenous polysaccharides with an average molecular mass of ca. 8.3 kDa. Analysis of the sugar composition of the gums after hydrolysis revealed that the molar ratio of Rha:Ara:Gal:GalA:GlcA was 25:10:40:7:15.

19786292,"Natural organic coagulants (NOCs) such as chitosan and Moringa oleifera seeds have been extensively characterized for potential application in water treatment as an alternative to metal-based coagulants. However, the action of both chitosan and M. oleifera seeds is mainly restricted to anionic organic pollutants because of their cationic functional groups affording poor cationic pollutant coagulation by electrostatic repulsion. In this study, we employed ethanolic grape seed extract (GSE) and grape seed-derived polyphenols such as tannic acid and catechin in an effort to find novel NOCs showing stable anionic forms for removal of cationic organic pollutants. The target substances tested were malachite green (MG) and crystal violet (CV), both mutagenic cationic dyes. Polyphenol treatment induced fast decolorization followed by gradual floc formation concomitant with red or blue shifts in maximum absorbance wavelengths of the cationic dyes. Liquid chromatography analysis of flocs formed by polyphenols directly showed that initial supramolecular complexes attributed mainly to electrostatic attraction between polyphenol hydroxyphenyl groups and cationic dyes further progressed into stronger aggregates, leading to precipitation of dye-polyphenol complexes. Consistent with the results obtained using catechin and tannic acid, use of GSE also resulted in effective decolorization and coagulation of soluble MG and CV in aqueous solutions. Screening of several organic GSE components for NOC activity strongly suggested that natural polyphenols are the main organic ingredients causing MG and CV removal via gradual floc formation. The treatment by natural polyphenols and GSE decreased toxicity of MG- or CV-contaminated water.",Chemosphere,"['D002392', 'D011232', 'D004396', 'D000431', 'D005419', 'D005840', 'D056604', 'D010636', 'D059808', 'D012394', 'D012639', 'D013634', 'D027843', 'D014874']","['Catechin', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Coloring Agents', 'Ethanol', 'Flavonoids', 'Gentian Violet', 'Grape Seed Extract', 'Phenols', 'Polyphenols', 'Rosaniline Dyes', 'Seeds', 'Tannins', 'Vitis', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",Use of grape seed and its natural polyphenol extracts as a natural organic coagulant for removal of cationic dyes.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19786292,2010

The Nigri section consists of six commonly found species (excluding A. aculeatus and its close relatives) from which currently 145 different secondary metabolites have been isolated and/or detected. From a human and animal safety point of view, the mycotoxins ochratoxin A (from A. carbonarius and less frequently A. niger) and fumonisin B(2) (from A. niger) are currently the most problematic compounds. Especially in foods and feeds such as coffee, nuts, dried fruits, and grape-based products where fumonisin-producing fusaria are not a problem, fumonisins pose a risk. Moreover, compounds such as malformins, naptho-gamma-pyrones, and bicoumarins (kotanins) call for monitoring in food, feed, and biotechnology products as well as for a better toxicological evaluation, since they are often produced in large amounts by the black aspergilli.

Extrusion variables, temperature (160, 170, and 180 degrees C in grape seed, and 160, 170, 180, and 190 degrees C in pomace) and screw speed (100, 150, and 200 rpm in both) were tested using mixtures of grape seed as well as pomace with decorticated white sorghum flour at a ratio of 30 : 70 and moisture content of 45%. Samples of grape seed and pomace were analyzed for procyanidin composition before and after extrusion, and total anthocyanins were determined in pomace. Additionally, chromatograms from diol and normal phase high-performance liquid chromatography were compared for the separation of procyanidins. Extrusion of both grape by-products increased the biologically important monomer and dimers considerably across all temperature and screw speeds. Highest monomer content resulted when extruded at a temperature of 170 degrees C and screw speed of 200 rpm, which were 120% and 80% higher than the unextruded grape seed and pomace, respectively. Increases in monomer and dimer contents were apparently the result of reduced polymer contents, which declined by 27% to 54%, or enhanced extraction facilitated by disruption of the food matrix during extrusion.

Traditional foods, such as baklava (finely layered pastry filled with nuts and steeped in syrup), halvah (containing sesame paste and pistachios), cevizli sucuk (a confection made of grape juice boiled and dried on strings of nuts), Turkish delight (containing hazelnuts, pistachios, or walnuts), and pişmaniye (candy made of sugar, butter, and flour), were tested, and the performance of the method was established with spiked samples. To examine the robustness of the methodology, baklava was prepared from raw materials and spiked at the initial stage of dry ingredients and through subsequent stages of preparation of dough, after cooking, and after addition of syrup and nuts. For all products, the analytical method required grinding the composite foodstuff under liquid nitrogen to form a fine powder, which was then thoroughly mixed before subsampling. After vortex extraction into methanol-water (aflatoxins) and aqueous sodium bicarbonate (ochratoxin A), the sample was filtered, diluted with phosphate-buffered saline, and then passed through either an aflatoxin or ochratoxin A affinity column before HPLC analysis with fluorescence detection (using post-column bromination for the aflatoxins). In all the traditional Turkish products, the recovery of aflatoxin B1 ranged from 77 to 98%, and LODs were <0.1 microg/kg. For ochratoxin A, the recoveries were from 88 to 93% and LODs were similarly <0.1 microLg/kg.

It has been shown to catalyse the double reduction of anthocyanidins to form 2R,3R-flavan-3-ols, which can be further transformed to the 2S,3R isomers by non-enzymatic epimerization. ANR from grape (Vitis vinifera) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Unexpectedly, RP-HPLC, LC-MS and NMR experiments clearly established that the enzyme produces a 50:50 mixture of 2,3-cis and 2,3-trans flavan-3-ols which have been identified by chiral chromatography to be 2S,3S- and 2S,3R-flavan-3-ols, i.e. the naturally rare (+)-epicatechin and (-)-catechin, when cyanidin is used as the substrate of the reaction.

In an effort to obtain a thorough insight into the applicability of the models established, stem extracts from three different varieties were tested, by determining several indices of the polyphenolic composition, such as total polyphenol (TP), total flavanol (TFl), total flavone (TFn) and proanthocyanidin (PC) concentration. It was shown that the models generated can adequately predict the recovery levels for each polyphenol group, but the optimal conditions predicted for TP, TFl, TFn and PC recovery varied significantly. Notable differences were also seen among the different varieties. Correlation of the polyphenol indices with the antiradical activity and reducing power of the extracts indicated that the PC fraction might exert strong effects, while the influence of other groups was not apparent.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of a grape waste extract obtained by supercritical fluid extraction. Because the beneficial effect of grape is related to its content of polyphenolic molecules, the extract was chemically characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography in order to assess its major bioactive components. The antioxidant activity of the grape extract was determined. The results showed that the grape extract presents a strong antiradical activity in the in vitro 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical assay and protects against reactive oxygen species production in human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). In contrast, the extract did not protect in the citronellal thermooxidation system and showed a weak protective action against lipid peroxidation in Caco-2 cells. The clonogenic assay and the cell cycle distribution analysis showed that the grape extract has a significant antiproliferative effect in a tumor cell line.

19569104,"In this paper we illustrate the use of two different methodologies to investigate the presence of pesticide metabolites in parent pesticide-positive food samples, using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (UHPLC-QTOF) mass spectrometry. First, a common fragmentation pathway between the parent pesticide and its metabolites has been considered to search for metabolites in two positive market samples (imazalil in lemon, chlorpyrifos in grape). Secondly, olive oil samples from field residue trials were used for automated application of comparative software (MetaboLynx), which was used with treated and untreated samples to search for expected and unexpected metabolites of phosmet. One of the main objectives when using these approaches was to avoid the tedious manual searching for potential metabolites within the huge amount of information contained in the total ion chromatogram acquired by TOF MS. The common fragmentation approach applied to TOF MS full-acquisition data, considering an enhanced fragmentation in the collision cell, has allowed the discovery of two metabolites of imazalil (1-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-1H-imidazole and 1-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-1H-imidazole) in a lemon positive sample, as well as another two metabolites of chlorpyrifos (chlorpyrifos-oxon and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol) in a grape positive sample. Moreover, MetaboLynx application to TOF MS data, without promoting fragmentation, from treated and untreated olive oil samples has been helpful in detecting the metabolite phosmet-oxon. In both strategies, every metabolite detected by TOF MS was confirmed using QTOF and/or triple quadrupole instruments.

We report here the functional characterization of an anthocyanin O-methyltransferase (AOMT) from grapevine. The expression pattern in two cultivars with different anthocyanin methylation profiles (Syrah and Nebbiolo) showed a peak at start ripening (véraison), when the concentrations of all methylated anthocyanins begin to increase. The purified recombinant AOMT protein was active on both anthocyanins and flavonols in vitro, with K(m) in the micromolar range, and was dependent on divalent cations for activity. AOMT showed a preference for 3',5' methylation when a 3',4',5' hydroxylated anthocyanin substrate was tested. In order to assess its in planta activity, we performed transient expression of AOMT in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves expressing the Production of Anthocyanin Pigment1 (PAP1) transcription factor from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). PAP1 expression in leaves induced the accumulation of the nonmethylated anthocyanin delphinidin 3-rutinoside. The coexpression of PAP1 and AOMT resulted in an accumulation of malvidin 3-rutinoside. We also showed that AOMT localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of tobacco leaf cells.

IDPs have many roles such as in cell cycle control (p53), neuronal signal transmission (myelin basic protein), and protein stability (dehydrins). Producing recombinant IDPs in bacteria for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies is problematic because the lack of stable tertiary structure makes them excellent substrates for bacterial proteases, which will cause loss in yield. We have developed a two-step method to produce the grape dehydrin K(2) and YSK(2) using Escherichia coli. Dehydrins are expressed by certain plants in response to dehydration, increased salinity, or low temperatures. Purification of 10 mg/L (K(2)) and 15 mg/L (YSK(2)) was performed by boiling bacterial pellets to lyse the cells, remove most of the contaminating proteins, and denature bacterial proteases. This resulted in protein purity comparable to that produced by sonication and nickel affinity chromatography. Boiling was followed by cation exchange chromatography to remove the remaining trace contaminants. The sample was shown to be more than 95% pure by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.

19459709,"The effect of the addition of a grape flavor precursor extract to a grape juice, before or after fermentation with three different Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains, on the evolution of the wine aroma composition during a 9-month aging period on yeast lees has been studied. Wine aroma compounds were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after alcoholic fermentation and after 3 and 9 months of storage. The aging of wine on lees caused important changes in the aroma profiles of wines, making the concentrations of three terpenes, norisoprenoids (except beta-damascenone and beta-ionone), 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol, ethyl vanillate, syringaldehyde, and ethyl cinnamate increase, whereas the concentrations of most of the rest of compounds tended to decrease. Lees are responsible for the observed increasing trends, except for linalool and alpha-terpineol, and also for a large part of the observed decrements. As expected, the addition of precursors brings about an increment in the levels of most terpenes, norisoprenoids, vanillins, and ethyl cinnamate, and it is after an aging time when differences linked to the level of precursors in the must become more evident.

The results showed wide variation in the xylem sap protein composition, where a set of polypeptides with pI between 4.5 and 4.7 and M(r) of 31 kDa were present in abundant amount in muscadine (Vitis rotundifolia, PD-tolerant), in reduced levels in Florida hybrid bunch (Vitis spp., PD-tolerant) and absent in bunch grapes (Vitis vinifera, PD-susceptible). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis of these proteins revealed their similarity to beta-1, 3-glucanase, peroxidase, and a subunit of oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1, which are known to play role in defense and oxygen generation. In addition, the amount of free amino acids and soluble sugars was found to be significantly lower in xylem sap of muscadine genotypes compared to V. vinifera genotypes, indicating that the higher nutritional value of bunch grape sap may be more suitable for Xylella growth.

Long-term feeding of GSE diet was well tolerated without fatality, behavioural abnormality, changes in food consumption, body weight or liver function. The Abeta levels in the brain and serum of the mice fed with GSE were reduced by 33% and 44%, respectively, compared with the Alzheimer's mice fed with the control diet. Amyloid plaques and microgliosis in the brain of Alzheimer's mice fed with GSE were also reduced by 49% and 70%, respectively.

19249817,"The pomegranate fruit ( Punica granatum ) has become an international high-value crop for the production of commercial pomegranate juice (PJ). The perceived consumer value of PJ is due in large part to its potential health benefits based on a significant body of medical research conducted with authentic PJ. To establish criteria for authenticating PJ, a new International Multidimensional Authenticity Specifications (IMAS) algorithm was developed through consideration of existing databases and comprehensive chemical characterization of 45 commercial juice samples from 23 different manufacturers in the United States. In addition to analysis of commercial juice samples obtained in the United States, data from other analyses of pomegranate juice and fruits including samples from Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Syria, India, and China were considered in developing this protocol. There is universal agreement that the presence of a highly constant group of six anthocyanins together with punicalagins characterizes polyphenols in PJ. At a total sugar concentration of 16 degrees Brix, PJ contains characteristic sugars including mannitol at >0.3 g/100 mL. Ratios of glucose to mannitol of 4-15 and of glucose to fructose of 0.8-1.0 are also characteristic of PJ. In addition, no sucrose should be present because of isomerase activity during commercial processing. Stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry as > -25 per thousand assures that there is no added corn or cane sugar added to PJ. Sorbitol was present at <0.025 g/100 mL; maltose and tartaric acid were not detected. The presence of the amino acid proline at >25 mg/L is indicative of added grape products. Malic acid at >0.1 g/100 mL indicates adulteration with apple, pear, grape, cherry, plum, or aronia juice. Other adulteration methods include the addition of highly concentrated aronia, blueberry, or blackberry juices or natural grape pigments to poor-quality juices to imitate the color of pomegranate juice, which results in abnormal anthocyanin profiles. To adjust the astringent taste of poor-quality juice or peel extract, addition of nonpomegranate sugars is a commonly detected adulteration method. The profile generated from these analyses combined with information from existing databases and published literature has been integrated into a validated IMAS for PJ, which can be utilized to detect PJ adulteration. In this survey of commercial pomegranate juices, only 6 of 23 strictly met all of the IMAS criteria.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000465', 'D000596', 'D000872', 'D001628', 'D002241', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D047348', 'D038622', 'D029561', 'D012016']","['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Anthocyanins', 'Beverages', 'Carbohydrates', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Hydrolyzable Tannins', 'Internationality', 'Lythraceae', 'Reference Values']",International multidimensional authenticity specification (IMAS) algorithm for detection of commercial pomegranate juice adulteration.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19249817,2009

Leaving aside Muscat, differences between varieties were not relevant, although Grenache and Chardonnay presented some key peculiarities. In general, alcoholic fermentation showed the lowest potential to release volatile compounds from aromatic precursors, whereas enzymatic hydrolysis was the most efficient but also the most different. Practically, this implies that the predictive ability of this hydrolytic strategy is rather poor.

Synthesis of an authentic reference compound enabled confirmation of the presence of glut-4-MMP in a Sauvignon Blanc juice for the first time. The juice extract was obtained by batch-wise percolation of 6 L of juice through a sintered glass funnel packed with C18 sorbent, followed by further purification using low-pressure chromatography on C18. Analysis of the juice extract revealed a chromatographic peak with the same retention time and mass spectrum as the synthetic reference compound, and spiking experiments verified the findings.

However, the importance of these health beneficial effects of these botanicals remains elusive due to incomplete understanding of uptake, metabolism and bioavailability of proanthocyanidins in vivo. In the present study rats were given GSE orally (300 mg/kg, twice a day) and blood and urine were collected over a 24 h period. Monomeric catechins and their methylated metabolites, and proanthocyanidins up to trimers were detected in blood samples treated with GSE using LC-MS/MS operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. A new tetramethylated metabolite of dimeric proanthocyanidin (m/z 633) in GSE-treated urine was tentatively identified. Using LC-MS/MS, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were identified in the brain conclusively.

This procedure allowed us to separate a fraction of anthocyanin-free flavonol 3-O-glycosides that was further split into neutral and acidic subfractions, thus facilitating flavonol identification. By means of semipreparative reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, we isolated several of these flavonol 3-O-glycosides for structural elucidation. The identification of different flavonol 3-O-glycosides was based on liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry and NMR data when available. The results suggest that red grape flavonol 3-O-glycosides comprise three different complete series, according to the nature of the sugar moiety linked to the C-3 position. The 3-O-glucosides were the main derivative of the six possible flavonol aglycones (kaempferol, quercetin, isorhamnetin, myricetin, laricitrin, and syringetin), whereas the 3-O-galactoside derivatives were found as minor compounds for all of the flavonol aglycones. The 3-O-glucuronides are the third kind of red grape flavonol derivatives and normally account as minor compounds for all of the flavonol aglycones, with the exception of quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, which was as abundant as quercetin 3-O-glucoside.

However, knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying its regulation is still limited. The objective of this study was to dissect the genetic determinism of aroma in grapevine by applying the analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and the candidate gene (CG) approach. Two F(1) segregating progenies were evaluated through high-resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HRGC-MS) for the amounts of individual monoterpenes over 3 and 2 years. In the Italia x Big Perlon cross 34 CGs, chosen according to gene ontology (GO) terms, were placed on a complete map and tested for linkage with QTLs for linalool, nerol and geraniol levels. Two CGs mapped within a QTL for linalool content on LG 10. A third one co-localized with a major QTL for the level of the three monoterpenes on LG 5; this gene encodes 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), which is the first enzyme in the plastidial pathway of terpene biosynthesis. Depending on these findings, we report the first in silico analysis of grapevine DXS genes based on the whole genome sequence.

The analysis of the marc and seeds indicated that the contamination is primarily from the peels. Since superficial extraction of the seeds with hexane removed most of the mineral paraffins, the contamination of the seeds is largely on the surface, perhaps transferred from the peels during storage of the marc. Mechanical purification of the seeds combined with washing with hexane reduced the contamination of the oil by a factor of about 10. The refining process removed 30% of the mineral paraffins, primarily the more volatile components. Oil obtained from the seeds of fresh grapes, including grapes not having undergone any phytochemical treatment, contained clearly less mineral paraffins (up to 14 mg kg(-1)), and the peels were less contaminated, suggesting an environmental background contamination.

This critical review focuses on volatile compounds that contribute to wine aroma and provides an overview of recent developments in analytical techniques for volatiles analysis, including methods used to identify the compounds that make the greatest contributions to the overall aroma. Knowledge of volatile composition alone is not enough to completely understand the overall wine aroma, however, due to complex interactions of odorants with each other and with other nonvolatile matrix components. These interactions and their impact on aroma volatility are the focus of much current research and are also reviewed here.

18944341,"ABSTRACT Inflorescences of field-grown grapevines (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Gamay) were inoculated with a Botrytis cinerea conidia suspension or dried conidia at different stages during bloom in moist weather. Approximately 10% of the conidia germinated within 72 h, resulting in two to three times more latent infections than uninoculated controls in pea-size (7 mm in diameter) berries. In surface-sterilized pea-size berries, latent B. cinerea was present predominantly in the receptacle area. After veraison, latent B. cinerea also was found in the style and, in mature berries, latent colonies were distributed throughout the pulp. Inoculation at full bloom led to the highest disease severity (66%) at harvest, compared with 38% in controls. Stilbene stress metabolites in the flowers were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Resveratrol accumulated mainly after pre-bloom and full-bloom inoculation, but did not prevent infection. Piceid levels did not change following inoculation, while epsilon-viniferin was found in necrotic tissues only, and pterostilbene and alphaviniferin were not detected at all. B. cinerea conidia suspensions also were applied to various locations on flowers of pot-grown cvs. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Inoculation of the receptacle area, but not that of the stigma and ovary, resulted in latent infections. Stilbene synthesis was similar to the field results, with resveratrol accumulating mainly in the calyptra and receptacle area. Constitutive soluble phenolic compounds (mainly derivatives of quercetin and hydroxy-cinnamic acid) were present at high concentrations in the calyptra but at low levels in the receptacle area. These experiments confirmed bloom as a critical time for B. cinerea infection in grapes and suggest that the most likely site of infection is the receptacle area or cap scar exposed at anthesis. Stilbenes may have a limited role in inhibition of flower infection and latency in susceptible grape cultivars, and epsilon-viniferin may be a by-product rather than a deterrent of infection.",Phytopathology,[],[],"Botrytis cinerea Infection in Grape Flowers: Defense Reaction, Latency, and Disease Expression.",[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18944341,2012

Our research is aimed at determining biochemical basis of anthracnose tolerance in Florida hybrid bunch grape.

Among the 32 differentially expressed leaf proteins, two were uniquely expressed in tolerant genotypes in response to E. ampelina infection. These proteins were identified as mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthase and glutamine synthetase, which are known to play a major role in carbohydrate metabolism and defense. Several proteins including ribulose 1-5 bisphosphate-carboxylase involved in photosynthesis were found to be suppressed in susceptible genotypes compared to tolerant genotypes following E. ampelina infection.

Pulp-free berry skins were treated with liquid nitrogen and ground; seeds were also ground. Then, 3 g of samples were extracted with 30 mL of a mixture of methanol/water/formic acid 70:30:1 (v/v/v) under sonication and 1 microL of the final extract was injected into two 100 x 2.1 mm i.d., 1.8 microm Zorbax Eclipse plus C18 columns connected in series. Compounds were fractionated using a gradient elution of acidified acetonitrile/methanol 50:50 (v/v)/water. Columns were thermostatted at 70 degrees C. MS was carried out on an Agilent 6410 QqQ instrument equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Positive and negative MS/MS product ion scans were used for compound identification, whereas positive full scan MS in the m/z range 200-1400 was used for quantitation. By means of mass spectra comparison, various flavonols, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins and stilbenes were identified. Quantitation was performed by external calibration, and concentration values were corrected for matrix effect that was evaluated in separate experiments. Semi-quantitative estimation was performed for compounds for which standards were not commercially available. Recoveries ranged from 90-102% with relative standard deviation (RSD) <5%, whereas the between samples RSD was in the range 4-12%. Two surrogate standards were used for quality control.

A C-18 narrow bore column of 150 x 2.0 mm I.D. and a semimicro photodiode array detector (PDA) cell of 2.5 microL, in conjunction with a mass spectrometry detector equipped with an electrospray ionization source (ESI-MS) to confirm peak identification, were employed. The C-18 narrow bore column was eluted by a multisegment gradient of increasing concentration of acetonitrile in water-formic acid solution that was optimized on the basis of the results of a study carried out to evaluate the influence of mobile phase composition and gradient shape on separation performance and detection sensitivity by ESI-MS. The identification of individual phenolic compounds was performed on the basis of their retention times and both UV-visible and mass spectra, acquired by a mass spectrometer (MS) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source, employed in conjunction with the PDA detector. Libraries comprising retention times, UV-visible, and mass spectra for major phenolic compounds expected in grape berries were made by subjecting solutions of each phenolic standard to the optimized RP-HPLC method. Quantification of individual compounds was performed by the external standard method using a six point regression graph of the UV-visible absorption data collected at the wavelength of maximum absorbance of each analyte determined by the PDA spectra. The RP-HPLC method was validated in terms of linearity of calibration graphs, limits of detection, limits of quantification, repeatability, and accuracy, which was evaluated by a recovery study. The developed method was successfully applied to identify the phenolic compounds occurring in the whole berries of nine red and one white grape of different varieties of Vitis vinifera, comprising some autochthonous varieties of south Italy such as Aglianico, Malvasia Nera, Uva di Troia, Negroamaro, Primitivo, and Susumaniello. Large differences in the content of phenolic compounds was found in the investigated grape varieties.

The minimum fluorescence values produced by both fluorometer types in response to a reversible low-oxygen stress in apples were indistinguishable: both Fo and Falpha increased when O2 levels were lowered below the anaerobic compensation point (ACP); when gas levels returned to normoxia both parameters dipped below, then returned to, the original fluorescence baseline. The two parameters also responded similarly to the irreversible osmotic stress in grapes: in both cultivars, Falpha and Fo first decreased before reaching an inflection point at approximately 20% mass loss and then increased towards a second inflection point. However, the two parameters were not analogous under the irreversible osmotic stress; most notably, the relative Falpha values appeared to be lower than Fo during the later stages of dehydration. This was likely due to the influence of the Fm parameter and an overestimation of Falpha when measuring the fluorescence from healthy and responsive chloroplasts as found in grapes experiencing minimal water loss, but not in grapes undergoing moderate to severe dehydration.

In spite of their very low bioavailability, anthocyanins are indicated as active in preventing the progress of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, obesity, inflammation, and cancer. Any piece of knowledge concerning absorption, tissue distribution, metabolism, and excretion of dietary anthocyanins is expected to help understanding the apparent paradox between their low concentrations in cells and their bioactivity. The aim of this work was to investigate the renal uptake of dietary anthocyanins and the underlying molecular mechanism. A solution containing anthocyanins extracted from grape (Vitis vinifera) was introduced into the isolated stomach of anesthetized rats; after both 10 and 30 min, plasma, liver, and kidney were analyzed for their anthocyanin contents. While anthocyanins in the liver were at apparent equilibrium with plasma both after 10 and 30 min, kidney anthocyanins were 3- and 2.3-fold higher than in plasma, after 10 and 30 min, respectively. Since the transport activity of the bilitranslocase in kidney basolateral membrane vesicles was competitively inhibited by malvidin 3-glucoside (K(i) = 4.8 +/- 0.2 microM), the anthocyanin uptake from blood into kidney tubular cells is likely to be mediated by the kidney isoform of this organic anion membrane transporter.",Molecular nutrition & food research,"['D000818', 'D000872', 'D001693', 'D002570', 'D002851', 'D004032', 'D005960', 'D007668', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D008565', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D027843']","['Animals', 'Anthocyanins', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Ceruloplasmin', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diet', 'Glucosides', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Vitis']",Uptake of grape anthocyanins into the rat kidney and the involvement of bilitranslocase.,"[None, 'Q000097', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'blood', None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18655007,2009

Consistent EAD activity was obtained for 11 chemicals: (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate, (E)-linalool oxide, (Z)-linalool oxide, nonanal, linalool, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, methyl salicylate, decanal, beta-caryophyllene, germacrene-D, and alpha-farnesene. In flight-tunnel tests that involved female GBM and rubber septa loaded with subsets of these 11 compounds, we found that both the 11-component blend and a seven-component blend, composed of (E)-linalool oxide, (Z)-linalool oxide, nonanal, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, decanal, beta-caryophyllene and germacrene-D, elicited equivalent levels of upwind flight as freshly cut grape shoots. The removal of any of the seven compounds from the seven-component blend resulted in a significant decrease in female upwind flight responses. In a field trial with these two synthetic blends, traps equipped with either blend captured more female GBM compared to traps baited with hexane only (control), although the number of females caught was generally low. There were no differences in the number of males captured among treatments. Although in flight-tunnel trials, moths readily flew upwind to both grape shoots and rubber septa loaded with the best lures, they landed on shoots but not on rubber septa.

The aim of this study was, thus, to determine the antibacterial activity of grape seed extracts with special focus on the chromatographic characterization of active fractions. In the course of these investigations, extraction protocols were optimized so that microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) guaranteed highest preconcentration efficiency. Proanthocyanidins, monomeric flavonoid aglycones, as well as some of their glycosides could be identified within yielded extracts via high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). By that means the coherence number of possible isomers of procyanidins was approximated by a newly developed equation. As far as antibacterial activity determined via screening tests is concerned, the extracts generally have been found to be positively responsive toward 10 different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria strains. After fractionation of the raw extracts, proanthocyanidins P2, P3, P4 and gallate esters P2G and P3G (P = proanthocyanidin consisting of catechin and epicatechin units, n = oligomerization degree, G = gallate ester) were determined as active antibacterial agents toward 10 different pathogens.

18615235,"The localization of stilbene synthase (STS) (EC 2.3.1.95) in grape berry (Vitis vinifera L.) was investigated during fruit development. The berries were collected at 2, 4, 7, 11, and 15 weeks postflowering from the cultivar Nebbiolo during the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that berries accumulated cis- and trans-isomers of resveratrol mainly in the exocarp throughout fruit development. Immunodetection of STS protein was performed on berry extracts and sections with an antibody specifically developed against recombinant grape STS1. In agreement with resveratrol presence, STS was found in berry exocarp tissues during all stages of fruit development. The labeled epidermal cells were few and were randomly distributed, whereas nearly all the outer hypodermis cells were STS-positive. The STS signal decreased gradually from exocarp to mesocarp, where the protein was detected only occasionally. At the subcellular level, STS was found predominantly within vesicles (of varying size), along the plasma membrane and in the cell wall, suggesting protein secretion in the apoplast compartment. Despite the differences in fruit size and structure, the STS localization was the same before and after veraison, the relatively short developmental period during which the firm green berries begin to soften and change color. Nevertheless, the amount of protein detected in both exocarp and mesocarp decreased significantly in ripe berries, in agreement with the lower resveratrol content measured in the same tissues. The location of STS in exocarp cell wall is consistent with its role in synthesizing defense compounds and supports the hypothesis that a differential localization of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic machinery regulates the deposition of specific secondary products at different action sites within cells.",Protoplasma,"['D000217', 'D000906', 'D002851', 'D005455', 'D005638', 'D019441', 'D021381', 'D000077185', 'D013267', 'D013347', 'D040521', 'D027843']","['Acyltransferases', 'Antibodies', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fruit', 'Plant Epidermis', 'Protein Transport', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Vitis']",Localization of stilbene synthase in Vitis vinifera L. during berry development.,"['Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000166', 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000201', 'Q000201', 'Q000166']","['metabolism', None, None, None, 'cytology', 'enzymology', None, None, 'analysis', 'enzymology', 'enzymology', 'cytology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18615235,2008

18585331,"A multi-element graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS) method was elaborated for the simultaneous determination of As, Cd, Cu, and Pb in wine samples of various sugar contents using the transversally heated graphite atomizer (THGA) with end-capped tubes and integrated graphite platforms (IGPs). For comparative GFAAS analyses, direct injection (i.e., dispensing the sample onto the IGP) and digestion-based (i.e., adding oxidizing agents, such as HNO(3) and/or H(2)O(2) to the sample solutions) methods were optimized with the application of chemical modifiers. The mixture of 5 microg Pd (applied as nitrate) plus 3 microg Mg(NO(3))(2) chemical modifier was proven to be optimal for the present set of analytes and matrix, it allowing the optimal 600 degrees C pyrolysis and 2200 degrees C atomization temperatures, respectively. The IGP of the THGA was pre-heated at 70 degrees C to prevent the sputtering and/or foaming of sample solutions with a high organic content, dispensed together with the modifier solution, which method also improved the reproducibility of the determinations. With the digestion-based method, the recovery ranged between 87 and 122%, while with the direct injection method it was between 96 and 102% for Cd, Cu, and Pb, whereas a lower, compromise recovery of 45-85% was realized for As. The detection limits (LODs) were found to be 5.0, 0.03, 1.2, and 0.8 microg l(-1) for As, Cd, Cu, and Pb, respectively. The characteristic mass (m(0)) data were 24 pg As, 1.3 pg Cd, 13 pg Cu, and 35 pg Pb. The upper limits of the linear calibration range were 100, 2, 100, and 200 microg l(-1) for As, Cd, Cu, and Pb, respectively. The precisions were not worse than 4.8, 3.1, 3.7, and 2.3% for As, Cd, Cu, and Pb, respectively. For arsenic, a higher amount of the modifier (e.g., 20 microg Pd plus 12 microg Mg(NO(3))(2)) could be recommended to overcome the interference from the presence of sulphate and phosphate in wines. Although this method increased the sensitivity for As (m(0)=20 pg), it also enhanced the background noise, thus only a slight improvement in the LOD of As (3.9 microg l(-1)) was realized. For the 35 red and white wine samples studied, the highest metal contents were observed for Cu ranging from 20 to 640 microg l(-1) (average: 148 microg l(-1)), followed by Pb from 6 to 90 microg l(-1) (average: 32.3 microg l(-1)), and Cd from 0.05 to 16.5 microg l(-1) (average: 1.06 microg l(-1)), whereas the As content was below the LOD. This wide fluctuation in the trace metal content could be associated with the origin of wines from various regions (i.e., different trace metal level and/or quality of soil, and/or anthropogenic impact), and with diverse materials (e.g., additives and containers) involved in the wine production processes. The Cu content of wine samples was significantly correlated with Pb, whereas its weak anti-correlation was found with Cd. Interestingly, the level of Pb was anti-correlated with the year of production of the wines.

The column oven temperature during the reverse phase C-18 HPLC greatly affected the separation of individual anthocyanins. The result showed that the optimum column oven temperature was 35 degrees C. Sixteen different anthocyanins (11 nonacylated and 5 acylated anthocyanins) were identified in the grape juices. Oll-Meoru, Neut-Meoru, and Muscat Bailey A (MBA) grape juices contained only nonacylated anthocyanins. Oll-Meoru and Neut-Meoru grape juices had same anthocyanins, but their proportions were considerably different. Peonidin 3,5-diglucoside and malvidin 3,5-diglucoside were the major anthocyanins in Oll-Meoru grape juice. Delphinidin 3-glucoside was, however, the major anthocyanin in Neut-Meoru grape juice. Peonidin 3-glucoside and malvidin 3-glucoside were the most abundant anthocyanins in Muscal Bailey A grape juice. Campbell Early grape juice contained both nonacylated and acylated anthocyanins.

18573373,"Grape-derived volatile compounds, including those released from odourless glycosidic precursor present in the grape, are strongly associated with the varietal aroma characteristic of non-aromatic wines. In this study, free and glycosidically bound volatile compounds of Fiano grapes have been identified and quantified by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The free volatile fraction of Fiano grapes was mainly characterised by the occurrence of several aliphatic alcohols, with minor amounts of the monoterpenes linalool and geraniol, and traces of the norisoprenoid beta-damascenone. The volatile fraction obtained from either enzymatic or acid hydrolysis of juice glycosides was more complex, and contained compounds belonging to the chemical classes of terpenes, norisoprenoids, benzenoids, and aliphatic alcohols. Linalool, geraniol, teprinen-4-ol, 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphtalene (TDN), beta-damascenone, (E)-1-(2,3,6-trimenthylphenyl)buta-1,3-diene (TPB), ethyl cinnamate, and 4-vinyl guaiacol were detected by GC-olfactometry (GC-O) as odorants of young Fiano wine that were formed through hydrolysis of grape precursors. Pathways of formation of these compounds during winemaking were investigated.

18573371,"This study assessed the impact of fruit temperature on the phenolic metabolism of grape berries (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Merlot) grown under field conditions with controlled exposure to sunlight. Individual cluster temperatures were manipulated in situ. Diurnal temperature fluctuation was damped by daytime cooling and nighttime heating of clusters. Daytime-only and nighttime-only temperature controls were applied for comparison. Berry temperatures were recorded continuously to compare the chemical data. Samples collected at véraison indicated that damping the diurnal temperature fluctuation advanced the onset of ripening. Those berries were larger (double-damped: 0.753+/-0.015gberry(-1) vs control: 0.512+/-0.034gberry(-1)) and more colored than all others. Development of phenolic metabolites was followed by two reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography methods and gel permeation chromatography. These methods provided information on anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, flavan-3-ol monomers, and polymeric material. Damping the diurnal temperature fluctuation reduced proanthocyanidin mean degree of polymerization (double-damped: 21.8+/-1.0 vs control: 28.0+/-1.7). Proanthocyanidin accumulation at véraison was linearly related to heat summation over the developmental period with nighttime heating yielding the highest concentration and daytime cooling yielding the lowest (night-heat: 1.46+/-0.13mgberry(-1) vs day-cool: 0.97+/-0.09mgberry(-1)).

Twenty-two free volatiles were identified in Traminette juice. The most abundant volatile compounds included hexanal, trans-2-hexenal, linalool, nerol, and geraniol. These compounds were quantified and compared with those in Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, and Riesling juice. The hexanal concentration was the highest in Chardonnay, and trans-2-hexenal concentration was the lowest in Riesling. Traminette contained the highest amount of monoterpenes, especially geraniol. Concentrations of free volatile compounds in Traminette varied between the hot site and the cool site. In fact, the concentrations of 6-carbon aldehydes were higher in Traminette grown in the cool site than those grown in the hot site, whereas monoterpenes were higher in the hot site than in the cool site. Among the 5 training systems, vines on the vertical shoot-positioned produced the highest amount of monoterpenes, specifically geraniol.

The enzyme extract was further characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled to peptide mass fingerprinting of eight spots using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. No beta-glucosidase but a beta-fructosidase associated to the relevant spot at 66 kDa/pI 5.1 was identified. Taken together all results issued from the biochemical characterization, the substrate specificity and the mass spectrometry-based identification of this enriched enzyme extract, we propose that this protein could be a specific beta-fructosidase isoform associated with a broad spectrum of beta-glycosidase activities in grape berry skin and involved in cell wall modifications which occur during the ripening-induced thickness of the grape.",The protein journal,"['D002473', 'D015180', 'D019032', 'D013379', 'D027843', 'D043324']","['Cell Wall', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Vitis', 'beta-Fructofuranosidase']",Combined mass mapping and biochemical characterization of grape beta-glycosidase-enriched extract.,"['Q000201', None, None, None, 'Q000201', 'Q000737']","['enzymology', None, None, None, 'enzymology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18459038,2008
18445523,"Pressed grape pomace obtained from the wine production of Cabernet sauvignon (Vitis vinifera) vintage was dried until 9.8% moisture content, ground and submitted to extraction of soluble components from different extraction techniques. Low pressure extractions were performed with ethanol maceration followed by fractionation with n-hexane, dichloromethane, butanol and ethyl acetate. These solvents were furthermore applied for soxhlet extraction. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was also performed to obtain grape pomace extracts by using pure CO2 and CO2 with ethanol as co-solvent in concentrations of 10, 15 and 20%w/w. The operating condition used in high pressure extractions was 150bar and 40 degrees C. The antioxidant activity of the grape pomace extracts was determined considering the free radical scavenging assay using 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and was correlated with the total phenol content determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The results obtained in DPPH tests indicate the highest antioxidant activity of 96.6+/-0.3%AA, with an IC50 value of 13+/-1, for the extracts obtained with ethyl acetate in solid-liquid extraction. The highest yield values were achieved in soxhlet extraction with ethanol (13.2%w/w) and with butanol (12.2%w/w), and also by SFE with 15% ethanol (9.2%w/w).

Black aspergilli constituted 56.9% (52.2% Aspergillus niger aggregates, 2.9% Aspergillus japonicus and 1.8% Aspergillus carbonarius) while the isolation rate of Aspergillus flavus the none habitual member of grape mycobiota was 43.1% of the total Aspergillus spp. isolated. All isolates were tested for the ability to produce the Ochratoxin A (OTA) and the Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). A. carbonarius showed that it is the only species able to produce the OTA with a production ability of 100% and a maximum concentration reaching 8.38microg/g CYA. As for the aflatoxigenic ability, 43.4% of A. flavus isolates produced this mycotoxin with a maximum production reaching 22.6microg/g CYA while none of the other isolates showed a production capacity of this mycotoxin.

18399460,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin mainly produced by a number of species of Aspergillus, commonly found in warm and tropical climates. OTA poses risks for the human health because of its nephrotoxic, teratogenic, immunotoxic and neurotoxic activity. The mycotoxin, classified as possible human carcinogen (Group 2B) by the IARC, naturally occurs in a wide range of foods, including wine, where the main producer is A. carbonarius. The aim of this work was the validation of a procedure for the analysis of OTA in Piedmontese red and white wines produced after vintage 2003 and 2004, in relationship with the limit of 2.0 microg l(-1) introduced by European Union for wine, must or grape juice (Regulation CE N. 123/2005). An analytical method based on immunoaffinity column (IAC) for clean-up and liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) was used to determine the occurrence of OTA in wines. Detection limit (LOD) and quantification Limit (LOQ) were 7.18 pg/ml and 9.31 pg/ml based on statistical method (IUPAC). Average recoveries of OTA from wine samples spiked at levels from 0.1 to 10 ng/ml ranged from 90.8% to 92.4%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) between 2.64 and 2.71%. Repeatability limit was 8.73 pg/ml for samples spiked with 0.1 ng/ml of OTA. Ninety-one Denomination of Controlled Origin (DOC) wines were analysed, including 41 Barbera (red), 38 Dolcetto (red), and 16 white wines, such as Erbaluce, Cortese and Roero Arneis. The study focused on wines commercialized in Italian supermarkets and wine shops. The white wines resulted, as expected, less contaminated than the red ones. Wines produced after vintage 2003, a season particularly conducive to the growth of A. carbonorius, contained higher levels of OTA than the wines produced in 2004. The samples, resulting positive, contained a concentration of OTA highly inferior to the threshold limits introduced by the European Union.

The method resolved the co-elution problems as observed in full scan one-dimensional GC-MS analysis and allowed chromatographic separation of 51 pesticides within 24 min run time with library-searchable mass spectrometric confirmation. Four pesticides, viz. chlorpyrifos-methyl, vinclozoline, parathion-methyl and heptachlor could be baseline separated on GCxGC, which were otherwise closely eluting and interfering each other's detection in 1D GC-MS run. Similarly, it could be possible to separate myclobutanil, buprofezin, flusilazole and oxyfluorfen on GCxGC. Although in 1D GC-MS, these closely eluting compounds could be identified through deconvolution algorithm and 'peak-find' option of the Chromatof software but the spectral purity significantly improved on GCxGC analysis. Thorough optimization was accomplished for the oven temperature programming, ion source temperature and GCxGC parameters like modulation period, duration of hot pulses, modulation-offset temperature, acquisition rate, etc. to achieve best possible separation of the test compounds. The limit of detection significantly improved by 2-12 times on GCxGC-TOFMS against GC-TOFMS because of sharper and narrower peak shapes. The method was tested for grape matrix after preparing the samples using previously described method and recoveries of the entire test pesticides were within 70-110% at 10 ng/g level of fortification.

18348043,"Although the list of pesticides used in integrated pest management (IPM) in grape growing and their annual application rates are limited, we are still confronted with the problem of pesticide residues in grapes. This paper presents the results of pesticide monitoring of 47 samples of wine grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) from the 2006 vintage from vineyards included in IPM. The grape samples were analysed for the presence of 67 pesticides. Among them 20 were allowed in IPM in 2006. Grapes were sampled at harvest. Two internal analytical methods were used for the determination of pesticides: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for the determination of dithiocarbamates and a multi-residue GC-MS method. One grape sample (2.1%) contained no residues or they were below the limit of detection, 28 samples (59.6%) contained residues lower or equal than maximum residue levels (MRLs), and 18 samples (38.3%) exceeded national MRLs for cyprodinil (the concentration range was 0.03-0.40 mg kg(-1) of cyprodinil) and fludioxonil (concentration was 0.03 mg kg(-1) of fludioxonil). Multiple residues were found in 41 samples (87.2%). The highest number of pesticides detected per sample was seven. No violation of pesticides allowed in IPM was observed. Folpet (97.9%), cyprodinil (51.1%), dithiocarbamates (44.7%), chlorothalonil (23.4%), chlorpyriphos (19.1%) and pyrimethanil (14.9%) were the most frequently found pesticides in grapes. Risk assessment showed that the exceeded concentrations of cyprodinil and fludioxonil did not represent any risk for consumer's health (the national estimate of short-term intake as a percentage of the acceptable daily intake was below 100%).","Food additives & contaminants.

18247534,"The potent aroma compound rose oxide was quantified in several white wines by a headspace solid-phase microextration stable isotope dilution assay (HS-SPME-SIDA) and the enantiomeric ratios of the cis diastereomers were determined by enantioselective capillary GC. The most odor-active stereoisomer (23)-cis-rose oxide was detectable in all investigated white wines ranging from 0.2 to 12 microg/L. However, its contribution to the overall aroma in some white wine varieties can be neglected as indicated by a low odor activity value (OAV). The highest concentrations were found in Gewürztraminer wines, confirming the importance of rose oxide as a varietal aroma compound in this variety. Surprisingly, the enantiomeric ratio of cis-rose oxide in all investigated wines was substantially lower than in nonfermented musts and in some wines almost racemic cis-rose oxide was detected. Fermentation studies with a model must that contained deuterated water revealed that yeast is capable of reducing the precursor 3,7-dimethyl octa-2,5-dien-1,7-diol (geranyl diol I) yielding 3,7-dimethyl-5-octen-1,7-diol (citronellyl diol I) that gives rise to cis- and trans-rose oxide after acid catalyzed cylization. The deuterium labeling pattern of the resulting rose oxide stereoisomers and a clearly detectable kinetic isotope effect indicate that at least two different reductive pathways in yeast exist that yield cis-rose oxide with different enantiomeric ratios altering the genuine enantiomeric ratio in grape musts. The presence of (+)-cis-rose oxides in wines can therefore be attributed to the reductive yeast metabolism during fermentation. This observation corroborates recent findings that the modification of terpene derived varietal aroma is an integral part of yeast metabolism and not only a simple hydrolytical process.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002849', 'D005285', 'D006801', 'D009812', 'D012441', 'D012903', 'D052617', 'D013237', 'D013649', 'D027843', 'D014835', 'D014920']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Fermentation', 'Humans', 'Odorants', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Smell', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Taste', 'Vitis', 'Volatilization', 'Wine']",Stereoselective formation of the varietal aroma compound rose oxide during alcoholic fermentation.,"['Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","['methods', None, None, 'analysis', 'metabolism', None, 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247534,2008

Isothermal experiments above 100 degrees C are difficult to design because they require high pressure and small sample size in sealed containers. Therefore, a nonisothermal method was developed to estimate the thermal degradation kinetic parameter of nutraceuticals and determine the confidence intervals for the parameters and the predicted Y (concentration). Grape pomace at 42% moisture content (wb) was heated in sealed 202 x 214 steel cans in a steam retort at 126.7 degrees C for > 30 min. Can center temperature was measured by thermocouple and predicted using Comsol software. Thermal conductivity (k) and specific heat (C(p)) were estimated as quadratic functions of temperature using Comsol and nonlinear regression. The k and C(p) functions were then used to predict temperature inside the grape pomace during retorting. Similar heating experiments were run at different time-temperature treatments from 8 to 25 min for kinetic parameter estimation. Anthocyanin concentration in the grape pomace was measured using HPLC. Degradation rate constant (k(110 degrees C)) and activation energy (E(a)) were estimated using nonlinear regression. The thermophysical properties estimates at 100 degrees C were k = 0.501 W/m degrees C, Cp= 3600 J/kg and the kinetic parameters were k(110 degrees C)= 0.0607/min and E(a)= 65.32 kJ/mol.

18173238,"Knowledge about the relation between grape and wine phenolics is of key interest for the wine industry with respect to being able to predict wine quality from analyses of grapes. Prediction of the phenolic composition and color of experimentally produced red wines from the detailed phenolic composition of the corresponding grapes was investigated using a multivariate approach. Grape extracts and wines were produced from 55 different grape samples, covering 8 different Vitis vinifera cultivars: Alicante, Merlot, Syrah, Cinsault, Grenache, Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Mourvedre. The phenolic composition of the grapes and wines showed that the average ratios between wine and grape phenolics ranged from 0.25 to 7.9 for the different phenolic compounds. Most interestingly, the average ratios were low for anthocyanins (0.31) and tannins (0.32), intermediate for (+)-catechin (0.75) and polymeric pigments (0.98), and high for gallic acid (7.9). Individual wine phenolics in general correlated well with several grape phenolics, indicating that a multivariate approach might be advantageous for prediction of wine phenolics from grape phenolics analysis. However the use of multivariate prediction of individual wine phenolics from the complete grape phenolic composition only improved the prediction of wine polymeric pigments, whereas wine anthocyanins were predicted with the same precision as from the direct relation with grape anthocyanins. Prediction of color attributes of pH normalized experimental wines from the phenolic profiles of grapes was accomplished using a multivariate approach. The correlation between predicted and measured total wine color was high ( r = 0.958) but was very similar to the correlation coefficient obtained for the direct relation between grape anthocyanins and total wine color ( r = 0.961).

Most of the metabolic studies are done in well-controlled laboratory conditions, yet wine is produced in less-reproducible industrial conditions. The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of fermentation temperature (13 degrees C and 25 degrees C) and culture media (synthetic media and grape must) on yeast lipid composition and volatile compounds in wine. Our results show that yeast viability was better at 13 degrees C than at 25 degrees C whichever growth medium is used, but that the complexity of the grape must enabled cells to reach higher viable population size. Viability was also related to the incorporation of linoleic acid and beta-sitosterol, which were present in the grape must. A lower temperature modified the cellular lipid composition of yeast, increasing the degree of unsaturation at the beginning of fermentation and decreasing the chain length as fermentation progressed. We also found that medium-chain fatty acids, mainly dodecanoic acid, were present in the cell phospholipids.

18020411,"Early white winemaking operations are known to affect the extraction of grape skin compounds into the juice fraction, which will dictate their concentration in the resulting wine. Grape skin contact and the amount of pressure applied during grape pressing affect the extraction of varietal aromas located in the skins. Compounds such as the polyphenols and glutathione, with antioxidant properties involved in juice oxidation processes and white wine stability, are also affected. The present study evaluates how grape skin contact and the amount of pressure applied during grape pressing affect the levels of S-(3-hexan-l-ol)cysteine (3MH-S-cys, a key grape-derived precursor to the volatile thiol 3-mercapto-hexanol (3MH), which is reminiscent of passion fruit aroma); 2-methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine (IBMP, with a capsicum-like descriptor); phenolic compounds; and glutathione in Sauvignon Blanc juice. The study was conducted using grapes obtained from commercial Marlborough (New Zealand) vineyards, using both commercial and laboratory grape-processing procedures. Immobilized metal ion chromatography was used to isolate the 3MH- S-cys precursor from the juices. The isolated precursor was then volatilized by trimethylsilylation and analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). IBMP was analyzed by GC/MS after solvent extraction, and a high-performance liquid chromatography method was used for the quantification of phenolic compounds and glutathione. 3MH- S-cys levels were seen to increase in juice fractions obtained from a winery press operating at higher pressures. The increase was attributed to the cumulative effect of longer skin contact time and the amount of pressure applied. The highly water-soluble IBMP was less affected by the amount of pressure applied during commercial grape pressing. Additional information was generated by the specific assessment of skin contact and applied pressure during grape pressing in a laboratory trial. In this trial, a long (32 h) skin contact time resulted in a greater release of varietal aroma compounds, 3MH- S-cys, and IBMP into the juice, and the concentration was further raised by increasing the pressure applied during pressing. However, for both experiments, the extraction of the varietal aroma compounds was offset by a clear increase in the juice oxidative potential, seen by a decline in glutathione content, a natural grape antioxidant, and an increase in particular oxidizeable polyphenol compounds, which may cause the must or wine to brown and lead to a loss of varietal aromas.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D003545', 'D005419', 'D005511', 'D005638', 'D010636', 'D059808', 'D011312', 'D013997', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Cysteine', 'Flavonoids', 'Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Phenols', 'Polyphenols', 'Pressure', 'Time Factors', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Effect of skin contact and pressure on the composition of Sauvignon Blanc must.,"['Q000031', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None]","['analogs & derivatives', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18020411,2008

To this purpose, crude ethanol extracts from both agricultural byproducts were attained and subsequently fractionated in order to obtain an organic/water fraction (FOW). Extracts and fractions were analyzed for antioxidant power and their phenolic components tentatively identified by HPLC-MS. Chromatographic peaks of almond hull extracts showed the occurrence of hydroxybenzoic and cinnamic acid derivatives, with minor presence of flavan-3-ols (ECG, EGCG), whereas the FOW fraction offered the additional presence of epicatechin (EC) and glycosylated flavonols. In the composition for extracts of white and red grape pomace several of these compounds were also detected but basically consisted of glycosylated flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol). As a difference between both grape pomaces, myricetin glycosyde was found in that from the red variety, whereas flavan-3-ols (EC, afzelechin) were only identified in white pomace. When their FOW fractions were analyzed, gallic acid and some hydroxybenzoic acids were additionally detected. Antioxidant activity was assessed by DPPH and TBARS assays. Almond hulls showed inhibition percentages lower than 50% in both assays, while the inhibition percentage ranged from 80% to 90% in pomace extracts. Red grape pomace extract was the most efficient antioxidant, with an EC50 value of 0.91 g/L for TBARS and 0.20 g/L for DPPH. Even appearing as two quite different vegetal matrixes, the composition of phenolics in grape pomace and almond hulls is quite similar, the main difference being the major occurrence of flavonols in grape pomace.

In the present study, the effect of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity on phytochemical stability of an ascorbic acid-fortified muscadine grape juice following high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing (400 and 550 MPa for 15 min) and after 21 d of storage at 25 degrees C was investigated. Addition of rosemary and thyme polyphenolic extracts (copigmentation) was evaluated as a means to stabilize anthocyanins and ascorbic acid during pressurization and subsequent storage.

Overall PPO activity increased (3- and 2.5-fold) following HHP at 400 and 550 MPa, respectively, although it was significantly lower in copigmented treatments. Higher anthocyanin losses occurred at 400 (approximately 70%) than at 550 MPa (approximately 46%), which were correlated to antioxidant losses (r = 0.89). Similarly, greater ascorbic acid losses were observed at 400 (84%) than at 550 MPa (18%).

Investigations of whole grape bunch samples from two major red wine Vitis vinifera cultivars (L. cv. Cabernet Franc and Pinot Noir), a commercial mannoprotein additive, and three commercial enological tannin additions indicated they are not likely significant sources of these compounds. Studies on 15 commercial oak barrelled red wines from six Vitis vinifera cultivars (L. cv.

Thus, following potential Brettanomyces-sourced aroma impacts in wine using 4-ethylphenol and/or 4-ethylguaiacol concentrations as proxies should only be considered reliable at analyte levels>100 microg L(-1). A review of worldwide 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol concentrations in wine, consumption patterns, and available toxicological data also suggested that levels of 4-ethylphenol being observed in wines worldwide do not warrant concerns about acute or long-term effects.

Catecholase has similar values in the two varieties, whereas Moscato cresolase data are almost 54% higher. In the first dimension, the PPO of both varieties may be detected by SDS-PAGE, but native PAGE (N-PAGE) gave negative results. For this reason, the samples were solubilized in the zwitteronic detergent Deriphat, which was also included in the gel and the cathodic buffer. Deriphat migrated together with the cathodic buffer, maintaining protein solubility and revealing the PPO profiles of Moscato and Prosecco extracts in native conditions. The combination of Deriphat-PAGE (D-PAGE) and SDS-PAGE (2-DE) also resulted in improved separation efficiency in resolving PPO and specialized stains in evaluating PPO activities. The control, represented by IEF for the first-dimensional separation, had a lower number of spots, demonstrating the higher capacity of Deriphat 2-DE to isolate PPO isoforms from grape extracts.

Vitis vinifera cv. 'Nebbiolo Lampia' berries were collected at 10-day intervals, starting 1 month after flowering to complete ripe stage; total protein extracts from deseeded berries were separated by 2-DE. A total of 730 spots were detected in the 2-DE gels. 118 protein spots, differentially expressed during berry development, were subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis. Ninety-three of them were identified, corresponding to 101 proteins. The majority of proteins were linked to metabolism, energy and protein synthesis and fate. In comparison to published surveys of major berry proteins, fewer proteins related to stress response and more proteins related to cell structure were differentially expressed. Our data confirm a general decrease of glycolysis during ripening, and an increase of PR proteins in the range of 20-35 kDa.

Fifty percent methanol extracts of some food samples such as barley, wheat, oat, corn, rice, and raisins could be analyzed directly by immunoassay after dilution in PBS; grape juice and beer samples could be analyzed directly after dilution with PBS; for coffee samples, a more complex method was used to remove the matrix effect effectively. Membrane-based colloidal gold immunoassays had a visual detection limit of 1.0 ng mL(-1) for OTA with a detection time of less than 10 min.

17641884,"Various studies have been drawn toward the beneficial properties of fruit juices because they have several components, such as phenols, vitamins, and flavonoids, with antioxidant effects. However, fruit juices can also contain residues of pesticides used as standard pest control methods in crops. Many of these pesticides are degraded through oxidative mechanisms, and their persistence in juices can be enhanced by antioxidants. This study covers the degradation of four pesticides, aldicarb, demeton-S-methyl, fenamiphos, and methiocarb, to their respective sulfoxide and sulfone in grape juices, water (pH 3.5) and water (pH 3.5) with quercetin (one of the most important flavonoids of grape) added in an attempt to establish whether the presence of antioxidants can affect the degradation rate of pesticides. For this purpose, a multiresidue method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) was developed for the simultaneous determination of these pesticides and their metabolites in commercial juices. The extraction procedure was carried out in C(18) columns. The subsequent elution of pesticides was performed with dichloromethane prior to the determination by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), using two precursor-product ion transitions. Average recoveries for all the pesticides studied were higher than 80%, with relative standard deviations lower than 15% in the concentration range 0.005-0.05 microg/mL, and the quantification limits achieved ranged from 0.1 to 4.6 microg/L. The results demonstrated that degradation was slower in fruit juices and aqueous solutions with quercetin than in water.

The wines obtained were analyzed by sensory descriptive analysis and by gas chromatography mass spectrometry to determine more than 90 aroma chemicals. The addition of the precursor fraction brought about a significant increase of the wine floral notes, irrespective of the yeast used. The levels of 51 wine aroma chemicals were found to depend on the precursor fraction addition and, in most cases, also on the yeast strain.

'Fernão-Pires' white grape was achieved by headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-ToF-MS). The plot of the first dimension versus the second dimension retention times using the m/z 93, 121, and 136 was used. The grapes were found to contain 56 monoterpenoids identified by GCxGC-ToF-MS. From these, 20 were reported for the first time in grapes. According to their chemical structure, the compounds were organized in different groups: monoterpene hydrocarbons and monoterpene oxygen-containing compounds, this later divided in oxides, alcohols (monoterpenols and monoterpendiols), aldehydes, esters, and ketones. A database composed by the retention indices of monoterpenoids calculated in the bi-dimensional column set was created, representing a developmental step in monoterpenoid analysis using a GCxGC system. Remarkable results were also obtained in terms of compound classification based on the organized structure of the peaks of structurally related compounds in the GCxGC contour plot. This information represents a valuable approach for future studies, as the ordered-structure principle can considerably help the establishment of the composition of samples. This study proposes a methodology and provides data that can be applied to determine the monoterpenoid profile of grapes, and its extension to the analysis of musts, and wines.

17580875,"'Black pepper' aroma and flavor is important to some Australian Shiraz red wine styles but the aroma compounds involved have yet to be identified, and no objective analytical method to assess 'pepper' grape aromas is available to date. Samples of potentially 'spicy'/'peppery' grapes were obtained from vineyards in South Australia and Victoria over two vintages. The important sensory attributes of the grapes, including the aroma descriptor 'pepper', were rated by a sensory panel. The sensory study revealed a strong correlation between the intensity of 'pepper' aroma and the intensity of 'pepper' flavor perceived on the palate. The grape homogenates were analyzed by static headspace GC-MS using a cool inlet system. Vectors obtained by analysis of over 13 000 individual mass spectra per grape sample were then subjected to multivariate analyses. Both principal component analysis and partial least-squares regression were used to develop multivariate models based on mass spectra and aroma descriptors to explain the intensity of the rating of the 'pepper' character. Corresponding differences in mass spectra and aroma were observed among vineyards and from the same vineyards in different years. Additional optimization of the methodology enabled selection of a single region of the GC-MS chromatogram that allowed prediction of 'pepper' aroma intensity with a correlation coefficient >0.98 and led to the identification of alpha-ylangene, a tricyclic sesquiterpene. To assess the potential of alpha-ylangene as a marker for this sensory characteristic, a method for alpha-ylangene analysis of grapes and wine using HS-SPME-GC-MS was developed. Although not a significant aroma compound by itself, alpha-ylangene was a satisfactory marker for the 'pepper' aroma in grapes and wine, and its concentration showed similar discrimination between 'peppery' vineyards and vintages as that obtained using the multivariate models.

17567031,"Ethanol is a principle ingredient of alcoholic beverages with potential neurotoxicity and carcinogenicity, and the ethanol-associated oxidative DNA damage in the central nervous system is well documented. The present work studied the possible protective effects of grape seed oligomer and polymer procyanidin fractions against ethanol-induced toxicity and compared these with resveratrol and other well-known antioxidants (ascorbic acid and vitamin E). By using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay), a simple and sensitive technique for genotoxicity studies, the potential genotoxicity of acute and chronic ethanol administration in the different brain regions was investigated. Acute ethanol administration, at the dose of 2.5 or 5.0 g kg(-1) i.p., could induce significant DNA damage in cerebellum and hippocampus. Chronic administration of ethanol at the dose of 2.5 or 5.0 g kg-1 p.o. for 30 days could induce significant DNA damage in cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cortex, which could be auto-repaired at least 3 days after ethanol withdrawal. Oral administration of grape seed oligomer and polymer procyanidins and resveratrol (25, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1)) for 3 days before acute ethanol (5.0 g kg(-1), i.p.) or repeated administration of these substances together with ethanol (5.0 g kg(-1), p.o.) for 30 consecutive days could significantly inhibit DNA damage in brain cells induced by ethanol. As compared, ascorbic acid (50, 100, and 200 mg kg(-1)) and vitamin E (100, 200, and 400 mg kg(-1)) could also present protective effects on ethanol-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, the concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in brain regions of the mice were detected by gas chromatography after administration of ethanol plus antioxidants.

17452755,"To determine the mechanism of inhibition of anthocyanin accumulation in the skin of grape berries due to high temperature, the effects of high temperature on anthocyanin composition and the responses in terms of gene transcript levels were examined using Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon. High temperature (maximum 35 degrees C) reduced the total anthocyanin content to less than half of that in the control berries (maximum 25 degrees C). HPLC analysis showed that the concentrations of anthocyanins, with the exception of malvidin derivatives (3-glucoside, 3-acetylglucoside, and 3-p-coumaroylglucoside), decreased considerably in the berries grown under high temperature as compared with the control. However, Affymetrix Vitis GeneChip microarray analysis indicated that the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes were not strongly down-regulated at high temperature. A quantitative real time PCR analysis confirmed this finding. To demonstrate the possibility that high temperature increases anthocyanin degradation in grape skin, stable isotope-labelled tracer experiments were carried out. Softened green berries of Cabernet Sauvignon were cut and aseptically incubated on filter paper with 1 mM aqueous L-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine solution for 1 week. Thereafter, the changes in (13)C-labelled anthocyanins were examined under different temperatures (15, 25, and 35 degrees C). In the berries cultured at 35 degrees C, the content of total (13)C-labelled anthocyanins that were produced before exposure to high temperature was markedly reduced as compared with those cultured at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C.

Gradient elution has been used in conjunction with positive mode electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry to detect up to 171 pesticides and/or metabolites in different crop matrices using a single chromatographic run. Pesticide residues were extracted/partitioned from the samples with acetone/dichloromethane/light petroleum. The analytical performance was demonstrated by the analysis of extracts from lettuce, orange, apple, cabbage, grape and wheat flour, spiked at three concentration levels ranging from 0.01 to 0.10 mg/kg for each pesticide and/or metabolite. In general, recoveries ranging from 70 to 110%, with relative standard deviations better than 15%, were obtained. The recovery and repeatability data are in good accordance with EU guidelines for pesticide residue analysis.

Individual phenolic compounds were identified and quantified using HPLC-PDA-MS2. The catechin content and degree of polymerization of proanthocyanidins were also analyzed. Purple grape juice contained the largest number of individual phenolic compounds and also the highest concentration of total phenolics. The main components were flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins, and hydroxycinnamates, which accounted for 93% of the total phenolic content. In contrast, white grape juice, which contained principally hydroxycinnamates, had the lowest total phenolic content. Antioxidant activity was measured using the ORAC and FRAP assays, and the data obtained were in broad agreement with total phenol content. In view of the recent findings of the Kame project indicating that long-term fruit juice consumption can provide protection against Alzheimer's disease (Dai et al. Am. J.

17331955,"Several studies have documented the anticancer and chemopreventive efficacy of grape seed extract (GSE) against various malignancies including prostate cancer (PCA). GSE is a complex mixture of polyphenols including gallic acid (GA), catechin (Cat), epicatechin (Epi) and procyanidins-oligomers of Cat and Epi, some of which are esterified with GA. Initial studies to identify the GSE components cytotoxic to human prostate carcinoma (DU145) cells demonstrated that GA and several crude chromatographic fractions containing procyanidin dimers and trimers were biologically active. The focus of the present work was to purify 14 procyanidins from the fractions and to identify those with highest activity toward growth inhibition, cell death and apoptosis in DU145 cells. The most active procyanidin was identified by mass spectrometry and enzymatic hydrolysis as the 3,3'-di-O-gallate ester of procyanidin dimer B2 (Epi-Epi). B2-digallate exhibited dose-dependent effects on DU145 cells over the range 25-100 microM, whereas GA exhibited comparable activity at lower doses but was highly lethal at 100 microM. Structure-activity studies demonstrated that all three hydroxyl groups of GA are necessary for activity, but a free carboxylic acid group is not required even though esterification reduced the activity of GA. These data, and the fact that non-esterified B2 exhibited little or no activity, suggest that the galloyl groups of B2-digallate are primarily responsible for its effects on DU145 cells.

17261018,"Anthocyanins (Anths) in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) berries harvested at véraison from Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier cultivars were assessed nondestructively by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) excitation spectra. With increasing Anth content, less excitation light was transmitted to the deeper Chl layers, and thus the ChlF signal decreased proportionally. By applying Beer-Lambert's law, the logarithm of the ratio between the fluorescence excitation spectra (log FER) from a green and a red berry gave the in vivo absorption spectrum of Anths, which peaked at about 540 nm. Absolute quantitative nondestructive determination of Anths for each berry was obtained by the log FER calculated for two excitation wavelengths, 540 and 635 nm (absorbed and not-absorbed by Anths, respectively) of ChlF at 685 nm. Over a range of skin colors going from green to purple, the relationship between the log [ChlF(635)/ChlF(540)] and the Anth concentration of berry extracts was fairly well fitted (r 2 = 0.92) using a power function. Reflectance spectra on the same berry samples were also measured, and Anth reflectance indices, which were originally developed for apples and table grapes, were derived. The log FER Anth index was superior to the reflectance-ratio-based index, but was as good as the color index for red grapes (CIRG) calculated from the whole visible reflectance spectrum.

17252314,"Nitrogen starvation may lead to stuck and sluggish fermentations. These undesirable situations result in wines with high residual sugar, longer vinification times, and risks of microbial contamination. The typical oenological method to prevent these problems is the early addition of ammonium salts to the grape juice, although excessive levels of these compounds may lead to negative consequences for the final product. This addition reduces the overall fermentation time, regardless of the time of addition, but the effect is more significant when nitrogen is added during the yeast exponential phase. In this work we analysed the effect of adding different nitrogen sources (ammonia, amino acids or a combination of both) under nitrogen depletion in order to understand yeast metabolic changes that lead to the adaptation to the new conditions. These studies were carried out in a synthetic must that mimics the composition of the natural must. Furthermore, we studied how this addition affects fermentative behaviour, the levels of several yeast volatile compounds in the final product, arginase activity, and the expression of several genes involved in stress response and nitrogen metabolism during vinification. We found that the nature of the nitrogen source added during yeast late exponential growth phase introduces changes to the volatile compounds profile and to the gene expression. On the other hand, arginase activity and the expression of the stress response gene ACA1 are useful to monitor nitrogen depletion/addition during growth of the wine yeast considered under our vinification conditions.",Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,"['D000596', 'D000641', 'D001119', 'D015152', 'D002849', 'D005285', 'D015966', 'D009584', 'D012333', 'D012441']","['Amino Acids', 'Ammonia', 'Arginase', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Fermentation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal', 'Nitrogen', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae']",The nature of the nitrogen source added to nitrogen depleted vinifications conducted by a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain in synthetic must affects gene expression and the levels of several volatile compounds.,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000235', 'Q000187']","['metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'genetics', 'drug effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17252314,2007
17168899,"Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) tissues were transformed with a grape (Vitis vinifera L.) stilbene synthase cDNA, transcriptionally regulated by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Transgenic plants accumulated new compounds, not present in either wild-type or vector-transformed plants. These were identified, by high-pressure liquid chromatography, as trans-resveratrol and trans-resveratrol-glucopyranoside. The amounts of trans-resveratrol and its piceid form were evaluated in the transgenic fruit. It was found that the content of the metabolite varied during fruit maturation to up to 53 microg/g fresh weight of total trans-resveratrol at the red stage of ripening. This metabolite accumulation was possibly dependent on a combination of sufficiently high levels of stilbene synthase and the availability of substrates. With the aim of verifing the metabolic impairment, the amounts of chlorogenic acid and naringenin in both transgenic and wild-type ripening fruit were compared and no dramatic variation in the synthesis profile of the two metabolites was noted. To our knowledge, no data are available on the assessment of the effects of the expression of the StSy gene on other antioxidant compounds present in tomato fruit. To establish whether the presence of a novel antioxidant molecule affected the redox regulation in transgenic tomato fruit cells, the effect of resveratrol accumulation on the naturally present antioxidant pool was analysed. We showed that, in transgenic fruit which accumulate trans-resveratrol, there is an increase in the levels of ascorbate and glutathione, the soluble antioxidants of primary metabolism, as well as in the total antioxidant activity. Conversely, the content of tocopherol and lycopene, which are membrane-located antioxidants, is not affected.

Procyanidin localization and composition were determined over the course of development. Tannins were mainly localized in the inner cell fraction, due to their biosynthesis and storage. Cell wall tannins always exhibited a higher mean degree of polymerization as compared to the internal cell fraction, which had a constant mDP. The mDP of cell wall tannins also tended to increase at the end of maturation. Our results suggest tannin polymerization near the cell wall but an aggregation in the vacuole during growth. The tannin composition was typical of skins, and small differences were noted between the two cell parts. Surprisingly, epigallocatechin-3-gallate was also detected, although in a very small amount.

High correlation coefficient (> 0.95) and low standard deviation (< 10%) were obtained for all aroma-active compounds of interest. Two vintages of Pinot noir wines with three different grape maturities each were analyzed.

17041150,"Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) may be a stress-responsive enzyme, as GDH exhibits considerable thermal stability, and de novo synthesis of the alpha-GDH subunit is induced by exogenous ammonium and senescence. NaCl treatment induces reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular ammonia, expression of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Xanthi) gdh-NAD;A1 encoding the alpha-subunit of GDH, increase in immunoreactive alpha-polypeptide, assembly of the anionic isoenzymes, and in vitro GDH aminating activity in tissues from hypergeous plant organs. In vivo aminating GDH activity was confirmed by gas chromatorgraphy-mass spectrometry monitoring of (15)N-Glu, (15)N-Gln, and (15)N-Pro in the presence of methionine sulfoximine and amino oxyacetic acid, inhibitors of Gln synthetase and transaminases, respectively. Along with upregulation of alpha-GDH by NaCl, isocitrate dehydrogenase genes, which provide 2-oxoglutarate, are also induced. Treatment with menadione also elicits a severalfold increase in ROS and immunoreactive alpha-polypeptide and GDH activity. This suggests that ROS participate in the signaling pathway for GDH expression and protease activation, which contribute to intracellular hyperammonia. Ammonium ions also mimic the effects of salinity in induction of gdh-NAD;A1 expression. These results, confirmed in tobacco and grape (Vitis vinifera cv Sultanina) tissues, support the hypothesis that the salinity-generated ROS signal induces alpha-GDH subunit expression, and the anionic iso-GDHs assimilate ammonia, acting as antistress enzymes in ammonia detoxification and production of Glu for Pro synthesis.",The Plant cell,"['D000586', 'D000838', 'D053938', 'D008401', 'D015971', 'D018506', 'D005969', 'D018698', 'D008969', 'D011392', 'D017382', 'D012965']","['Amination', 'Anions', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Glutamate Dehydrogenase', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proline', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Sodium Chloride']",Abiotic stress generates ROS that signal expression of anionic glutamate dehydrogenases to form glutamate for proline synthesis in tobacco and grapevine.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000096', None, 'Q000096', 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'biosynthesis', None, 'biosynthesis', 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17041150,2006

Free anthocyanins accumulated until 170 g/L of sugars in pulp before undergoing a slight decrease. Changes in anthocyanin composition were observed with increasing sugar levels in the pulp that reflected structural differences between classes of anthocyanins. The proportion of methoxylated anthocyanins continued to increase in the skin as sugar accumulated while the proportion of coumaroylated anthocyanins initially increased (up to 200 g/L of sugars in the pulp) and then rapidly decreased. In comparison, no major quantitative nor qualitative change was observed for tannins, except for a slight increase of the mean degree of polymerization. Whatever the physiological stage of the pulp, the extraction yield of skin phenolics into hydroalcoholic solution for 5 h was lower than 77% for anthocyanins and 38% for proanthocyanidins. For both classes of compounds, no clear evolution in these extraction yields could be observed as sugars accumulated in pulp (from 162.6 to 275.0 g/L). Nevertheless, some structural features within each family of compounds significantly influenced extractability, for example, a lower extraction yield for coumaroylated anthocyanins and for tannins with a high degree of polymerization.

The effects of the light exposure of grape berry clusters on the composition of berry tissues were studied on the ""Merlot"" variety grown in a vineyard in Bordeaux, France. The light exposure of the fruiting zone was modified using different intensities of leaf removal, cluster position relative to azimuth, and berry position in the cluster. Light exposures were identified and classified by in situ measurements of berry temperatures. Berries were sampled at maturity (>19 Brix) for determination of skin and/or pulp chemical and metabolic profiles based on (1) chemical and physicochemical measurement of minerals (N, P, K, Ca, Mg), (2) untargeted 1H NMR metabolic fingerprints, and HPLC targeted analyses of (3) amino acids and (4) phenolics. Each profile defined by partial least-square discriminant analysis allowed us to discriminate berries from different light exposure. Discriminant compounds between shaded and light-exposed berries were quercetin-3-glucoside, kaempferol-3-glucoside, myricetin-3-glucoside, and isorhamnetin-3-glucoside for the phenolics, histidine, valine, GABA, alanine, and arginine for the amino acids, and malate for the organic acids. Capacities of the different profiling techniques to discriminate berries were compared. Although the proportion of explained variance from the 1H NMR fingerprint was lower compared to that of chemical measurements, NMR spectroscopy allowed us to identify lit and shaded berries. Light exposure of berries increased the skin and pulp flavonols, histidine and valine contents, and reduced the organic acids, GABA, and alanine contents. All the targeted and nontargeted analytical data sets used made it possible to discriminate sun-exposed and shaded berries.

It is not clear whether the cardioprotective effects of resveratrol can be reproduced by standardized grape extracts (SGE). In the present studies, we determined, using cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC), growth and specific gene responses to resveratrol and SGE provided by the California Table Grape Commission. Suppression of HASMC proliferation by resveratrol was accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in the expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 and heat shock protein HSP27. Using resveratrol affinity chromatography and biochemical fractionation procedures, we showed by immunoblot analysis that treatment of HASMC with resveratrol increased the expression of quinone reductase I and II, and also altered their subcellular distribution. Growth of HASMC was significantly inhibited by 70% ethanolic SGE; however, gene expression patterns in various cellular compartments elicited in response to SGE were substantially different from those observed in resveratrol-treated cells. Further, SGE also differed from resveratrol in not being able to induce relaxation of rat carotid arterial rings.

16756363,"An HPLC-MS method for the characterization of proanthocyanidins (PA) has been refined. Further application to red wines provided interesting conclusions about the composition of the flavanol fraction and PA extractability during winemaking. The yield in PA extraction increases with the length of the postfermentative maceration (PFM), as well as the mean degree of polymerization (mDP) of wine flavanols. In early winemaking events mostly monomers to trimers are extracted from grape solids, whereas PFM is required for the significant extraction of higher oligomers. Nevertheless, at the end of a regular process of elaboration the mDP is not very high and does not usually exceed a value of 2.3, dimers and trimers being the predominant flavanols in red wines. With regard to groups of compounds, gallocatechins and prodelphinidins (located in the skins) are extracted rapidly in the first stages of the winemaking. On the contrary, long postfermentative macerations are required for the extraction of galloyled derivatives from the seeds. PA extractability is also dependent on the grape variety used for winemaking. Thus, wines made with Graciano grapes were found to require a longer process of PFM than those made from Tempranillo grapes to obtain similar yields in the extraction of flavanols.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002851', 'D005285', 'D005419', 'D005638', 'D013058', 'D011108', 'D044945', 'D013045', 'D013997', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fermentation', 'Flavonoids', 'Fruit', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Polymers', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Species Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Characterization of the mean degree of polymerization of proanthocyanidins in red wines using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16756363,2006

Aspergillus carbonarius was never dominant at the different growth stages, or in different geographic areas and years, but it was confirmed as the key fungus because of the high percentage of strong OTA producer isolates in the population. The number of OTA producer strains, isolated in each vineyard at the different growth stages, was generally very limited and they were never statistically correlated to OTA content in bunches. The effect of geographic area on fungal flora was confirmed by statistical analysis, even though a major role was played by meteorological conditions, both on fungal colonisation and OTA content in bunches.

16629034,"The aim of this work was to study the spatial variability of ochratoxin A (OTA) in vineyards and to define a reliable sampling protocol for bunches in order to assess OTA content before harvesting. In 2002, two vineyards with 'Negroamaro' and 'Sangiovese' grape varieties were chosen in Southern Italy. The same sampling design was applied to both vineyards. Ten plants were collected from the X-shaped path of the whole vineyard (plants 1 through 10) and 10 plants from the two central cross-perpendicular lines (plants 11 through 20). Bunches harvested from plants 1 through 10 were numbered progressively, weighed, and crushed separately, and bunches obtained from plants 11 through 20 were crushed plant by plant. Juices obtained were analyzed for OTA content by high-performance liquid chromatography. Then, a simulated approach for sampling was applied, following randomized and systematic designs. High and random variability was observed in OTA content both among bunches and among plants in the two vineyards, independent of contamination level. Simulated sampling design markedly influenced the assessment of must contamination. The best results were obtained when sampling involved one bunch per plant, in a predefined position, from at least 10 plants.

Grape skins and seeds contain large amounts of polyphenols, which can also interfere with efficient protein extraction. In plants, two extraction protocols, TCA/acetone-based and phenol-based methods, have been mainly used to extract proteins from different organs or tissues on many species. However, few results have been reported for grape berry clusters. We wanted to determine which of these protocols was optimal for berry clusters in order to achieve both efficient protein extraction and high spot resolution on 2-D gels. Four protocols, derived from either TCA/acetone or phenol procedures, were tested on mature Cabernet Sauvignon whole berry clusters. The phenol-based protocols were superior to the TCA/acetone methods, showing larger protein yields and greater spot resolution on 2-D gels. One method was clearly superior to the rest, a phenol-based extraction method combined with resuspension in the presence of both urea and thiourea as chaotropes. A total of 81 spots were excised and identified following MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analyses.

Different sorbents for the extraction of the precursors were compared. The best results were obtained with LiChrolut EN polymeric resins which displayed two and six-fold more extraction capacity than Amberlite XAD-2 resins and C18 sorbents, respectively. C18 sorbents are more suitable for selective extraction of less polar precursors. The initial version of the method was imprecise and so the imprecision of the different steps was assessed. The maceration of the solid parts and the liquid-liquid extraction of the aromas released in the acid hydrolysis proved to be the critical steps. Greater crushing of the solid parts and solid-phase extraction (SPE) instead of liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) improved reproducibility. In the method finally proposed about 100 aromatic components belonging to four large groups (lipid derivatives, shikimic acid derivatives, norisoprenoids and terpenes) were determined with good reproducibility.

For products of high quality, warranty of origin and identity is required and analytical control is very important to prevent frauds. In this article, the ""state of art"" of mass spectrometry in enological chemistry as a consumer safety contribute is reported. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) methods have been developed to determine pesticides, ethyl carbamate, and compounds from the yeast and bacterial metabolism in wine. The presence of pesticides in wine is mainly linked to the use of dicarboxyimide fungicides on vineyard shortly before the harvest to prevent the Botrytis cinerea attack of grape. Pesticide residues are regulated at maximum residue limits in grape of low ppm levels, but significantly lower levels in wine have to be detected, and mass spectrometry offers effective and sensitive methods. Moreover, mass spectrometry represent an advantageous alternative to the radioactive-source-containing electron capture detector commonly used in GC analysis of pesticides. Analysis of ochratoxin A (OTA) in wine by LC/MS and multiple mass spectrometry (MS/MS) permits to confirm the toxin presence without the use of expensive immunoaffinity columns, or time and solvent consuming sample derivatization procedures. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) is used to control heavy metals contamination in wine, and to verify the wine origin and authenticity.

GSE is a complex mixture containing gallic acid (GA), catechin (C), epicatechin (EC) and several oligomers (procyanidins) of C and/or EC, some of which are esterified to GA. To determine which components are most active against PCA, an ethyl acetate extract of GSE was separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) into three fractions. Fraction 1 was far more effective than others in causing growth inhibition and apoptotic death of human PCA DU145 cells. Of the components in this fraction, GA showed a very strong dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition and apoptotic death of DU145 cells, but C and procyanidins B1 (EC-C dimer), B2 (EC-EC dimer) and B3 (C-C dimer) were nearly ineffective. Mechanistic studies demonstrated a strong caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavages by GA in DU145 cells. Procyanidin oligomers eluting in HPLC Fractions 2 and 3 were obtained in larger quantities by separating GSE into eight fractions (I-VIII) on a gel filtration column. All fractions were analyzed by HPLC-UV and negative-ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Fractions I-III contained the active compound GA and inactive components C, EC, B1 and B2. Fraction IV contained other dimers and a dimer-GA ester and was also less active than GSE in DU145 cells. Fractions V-VIII, however, caused significant growth inhibition and apoptosis with the highest activity present in the later fractions that contained procyanidin trimers and GA esters of dimers and trimers. Together, these observations identify GA as one of the major active constituents in GSE.

Capillary columns are the method of choice because it requires a reduced amount of injected sample and consequently the chloroform necessary for OTA extraction, which is a toxic agent. This method gives a detection limit of femtog/ml, without resorting to an immunoaffinity clean-up or concentration, which makes it by far superior to any other method reported. Moreover, by using MS as a detection method it is possible, in the case of a complex matrix, to measure its molecular mass and to confirm the presence of OTA by MS-MS, which cannot be done by fluorescent detection.

16414080,"Grape seed extract (GSE) is a commonly available dietary supplement taken for the anti-oxidant activity that's attributed to its proanthocyanidin (oligomers of monomeric polyphenols) content. Similar polyphenol-enriched preparations from blueberries and soy have shown protection against ovariectomy-induced or age-related cognitive deficits, suggesting that the molecular changes induced by these polyphenol preparations correlated with behavioral benefit. We hypothesized that ingestion of polyphenol-enriched preparations such as GSE would be manifested as protein changes that would be consistent with neuroprotection. Proteomics technology, namely 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, identified quantitative changes in specific proteins induced in adult rat brain following ingestion of a powdered preparation of GSE. As recently reported [Deshane, J., Chaves, L., Sarikonda, K.V., Isbell, S., Wilson, L., Kirk, M., Grubbs, C., Barnes, S., Meleth, S. and Kim, H., 2004. Proteomics analysis of rat brain protein modulations by grape seed extract. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 52, 7872-7883.], the direction of change for the majority of the affected proteins was opposite to the direction the proteins were changed in either Alzheimer disease or in transgenic mouse models of dementia. A conservative conclusion is that GSE has neuroprotective activity, by affecting specific proteins in particular ways. In this chapter, elements of proteomics-type analysis are discussed that demonstrate the power of the technology to enable discovery of proteins involved in the response of the brain to a stimulus whether it be a dietary supplement, or a psychoactive drug. The fact that GSE affects proteins implicated in cognitive disorders suggests moreover that GSE may have impact on the actions of psychoactive drugs by maintaining an overall viability of the nervous system.",Life sciences,"['D000818', 'D001921', 'D001923', 'D002392', 'D004591', 'D004958', 'D005260', 'D019833', 'D007091', 'D013058', 'D009419', 'D010449', 'D010936', 'D040901', 'D011619', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D000077185', 'D013267', 'D027843']","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Catechin', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Genistein', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Plant Extracts', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes', 'Vitis']",Proteomics analysis of the actions of grape seed extract in rat brain: technological and biological implications for the study of the actions of psychoactive compounds.,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000494', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000494', None, None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000737']","[None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'pharmacology', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'pharmacology', None, None, None, 'pharmacology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16414080,2006

16384897,"The ripening of grape (Vitis vinifera) berry is characterized by dramatic changes in gene expression, enzymatic activities, and metabolism that lead to the production of compounds essential for berry quality. The phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway is one of the components involved in these changes. In this study, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of VvMYB5a, a cDNA isolated from a grape L. cv Cabernet Sauvignon berry library. VvMYB5a encodes a protein belonging to a small subfamily of R2R3-MYB transcription factors. Expression studies in grapevine indicate that the VvMYB5a gene is mainly expressed during the early steps of berry development in skin, flesh, and seeds. Overexpression of VvMYB5a in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) affects the expression of structural genes controlling the synthesis of phenylpropanoid and impacts on the metabolism of anthocyanins, flavonols, tannins, and lignins. Overexpressing VvMYB5a induces a strong accumulation of several phenolic compounds, including keracyanin (cyanidin-3-rhamnoglucoside) and quercetin-3-rhamnoglucoside, which are the main anthocyanin and flavonol compounds in tobacco. In addition, VvMYB5a overexpression increases the biosynthesis of condensed tannins and alters lignin metabolism.

16262710,"The biosynthesis of methyl anthranilate, the volatile compound responsible for the distinctive 'foxy' aroma and flavor of the Washington Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), involves an alcohol acyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of methyl anthranilate from anthraniloyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and methanol. Although methanol is a poor substrate in comparison with the co-substrate, high levels of this acyltransferase (0.5% of the total protein) combined with relatively high levels of this alcohol make this reaction possible in grapes. This 449 amino acid protein belongs to the BAHD family of acyltransferases, having 58% identity with the benzoyl CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyl transferase from Clarkia. Both native and recombinant enzymes can use a broad range of acyl-CoAs and alcohols as substrates. The ability of Concord grape alcohol acyltransferase to accept a range of different CoA esters and alcohols suggests this to be a versatile ester-forming enzyme, similar to those of other fruits that than can produce a range of fruit esters based on the supply of appropriate substrates. Expression is coordinately regulated, with transcript, protein and enzyme activities coinciding with the accumulation of methyl anthranilate that occurs after the initiation of berry ripening. The majority of acyltransferase protein in grape tissues is localized to the outer fruit mesocarp, a result consistent with the fact that methyl anthranilate is released to the external environment throughout the ripening process.

16218657,"Dying-arm disease in grapevines, produced by infection with the ascomycete Eutypa lata, is responsible for major production losses in vineyards. Dieback of the shoots and cordon is believed to be due to acetylenic phenol metabolites produced by the fungus. To identify specific metabolites that could potentially be used for diagnosis of infection, eight E. lata isolates were grown in vitro on hot water extracts from grape varieties with various degrees of tolerance to the foliar symptoms of E. lata dieback. HPLC analysis showed that eutypinol was consistently produced in large amounts, together with smaller amounts of methyleutypinol and eulatachromene; eutypine, the putative toxin, was produced solely on Sauvignon Blanc extract and then in only barely detectable amounts. When E. lata isolates from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot were grown on identical media, the amounts of metabolites produced differed significantly between isolates but the pattern of metabolites was quite similar, with eutypinol again predominating. The consistent production of eutypinol indicated that this was the most suitable metabolite for which to analyze in order to diagnose the presence of E. lata. Extraction and analysis of grapevine tissues exhibiting symptoms of dieback failed to show the presence of any metabolites. However, when infected cordon sections were placed in water and cultured for 5 days, eutypinol was readily detected in the aqueous solution; metabolites were not produced from uninfected tissue.

The procedure was optimised for final analysis by capillary gas chromatography. At mass concentrations in model solutions ranging from 0.1 to 50 mg/l solid-phase extraction recoveries of all analytes ranged from 69% for 2-phenylethanol to 102% for capric acid, with RSD values from 2 to 9%. SPE recoveries of internal standards to be added in the sample solution prior to extraction, higher alcohols 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 1-undecanol, were 97 and 93%, respectively, with RSD values of 3%. Detection limits of analyzed compounds in model solutions ranged from 0.011 mg/l for isoamyl acetate to 0.037 mg/l for caproic acid.

The limit of detection for the microwell plate format was 0.8 +/- 0.1 microg/kg, and the limit of detection for the tube format was 1.6 +/- 0.2 microg/kg. A simple, rapid, and efficient extraction method was employed, and 76-112% recoveries of spiked samples were obtained. Methanol extracts of some agricultural product samples such as grape, carrot, spinach, and tobacco could be analyzed directly by immunoassay after dilution in 0.5% fish skin gelatin-phosphate buffered saline. In contrast, extracts of green tea caused significant interference in the assay, and a number of simple cleanup methods were ineffective in removing interference. However, use of the coagulating reagent polyvinyl pyrrolidone removed the matrix effect effectively. For the validation of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests, samples were analyzed by ELISA and gas chromatography (GC) after solid phase extraction. The relationship between data obtained using the tube assay and microwell assay was good (the lowest r(2) value was 0.94), and also, the immunoassay assay data correlated well with data obtained from GC analysis (the lowest r(2) value was 0.93).

Liver, kidney, brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract together with plasma, urine and faeces were collected over a 24 h period and their flavan-3-ol content was analysed by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry and diode array detection. Small amounts of the GSE flavan-3-ols moved out of the stomach and into the duodenum/jejunum, and to a greater extent the ileum 1 h after ingestion, and into the caecum after 2 h with relatively small amounts being detected in the colon after 3 h. The GI tract contained the parent GSE flavan-3-ols and procyanidins with only trace amounts of metabolites and there were no indications that proanthocyanidins were depolymerised in the GI tract releasing monomeric flavan-3-ols. Plasma contained exclusively catechin glucuronides and methylated glucuronide metabolites which were also detected in the liver and kidneys. These metabolites were also present in urine together with sulphated metabolites and low amounts of the procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3 and B4 as well as the trimer C2 and an unknown GSE trimer.

The main fungal genera isolated were Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Aspergillus. The isolation frequency of Aspergillus spp. section Nigri in contaminated samples was 82%. Ochratoxin A (OTA) production was assessed using yeast extract-sucrose broth supplemented with 5% bee pollen. Cultures of 205 isolates from this section showed that 74.2% of Aspergillus carbonarius and 14.3% of Aspergillus tubingensis isolates produced OTA at levels ranging from 1.2 to 3,530 ng/ml and from 46.4 to 111.5 ng/ml, respectively. No Aspergillus niger isolate had the ability to produce this toxin under the conditions assayed. Identification of the A. niger aggregate isolates was based on PCR amplification of 5.8S rRNA genes and its two intergenic spacers, internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and ITS2, followed by digestion with restriction endonuclease RsaI of the PCR products. The restriction patterns were compared with those from strains of A. niger CECT 2807 and A. tubingensis CECT 20393, held at the Spanish Collection of Type Cultures. DNA sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene-ITS2 region of the OTA-producing isolates of A. tubingensis matched 99 to 100% with the nucleotide sequence of strain A. tubingensis CBS 643.92. OTA determination was accomplished by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. OTA confirmation was carried out by liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry. The results showed that there are significant differences with regard to the isolation frequency of ochratoxinogenic fungi in the different grape varieties.

The results suggested a transcriptional GSPE regulation of glutathione related enzymes caused by an increase both in mRNA and in enzyme activity levels overall at 15 mg/L. We also assessed the GSPE effect on AOEs in cells submitted to oxidative stress. Under oxidative conditions (1 mM H(2)O(2), 1 h), we found a decrease in GSH content and an increase in MDA, and we suggested a posttranslational regulation of GPx/GR mRNAs and a transcriptional enhancement of GST mRNA. The GSPE pretreatment (15 mg/L, 23 h) before HepG2 submission to H(2)O(2) (1 mM, 1 h) showed an increase of the mRNA of GPx/GR with respect to the H(2)O(2) group, whereas the GSH content was similar to the control group.

By liquid mass spectrometry, anthocyanins of grape were studied, and in hybrid grape extracts, delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin and malvidin 3-O-(6-O-p-coumaroyl)-5-O-diglucosides were found. A semiquantitative procedure to estimate the amounts and percentages of monoglucoside and diglucoside anthocyanins without chromatography was developed. By gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS), aroma compounds of grape, wine and the distillate Italian grappa were studied, and molecular structures characterized. The representative aroma profile of Muscat grape was characterized by 23 terpenols, present in both free and bonded form, and direct correlation between aroma and genetic profile permitted to distinguish between different Muscat grape varieties. Aroma of Italian grappa resulted from and was characterized by several compounds linked to the grape variety, such as vitispiranes, terpenols, ethyl cinnamate, salicylic esters, benzaldehyde and farnesol.

The ingestion of large amounts of histamine can cause serious toxicological problems in man. Thus, it becomes important to set a reliable method for rapid histamine quantification in foods. The detection of bacteria exhibiting histidine decarboxylase activity is also important to estimate the risk of contamination of food. Previous enzymatic methods used to quantify histamine in fish gave erroneously high values due to interference when applied to wine. A new enzymatic method is described that allows the direct determination of histamine concentrations in this type of sample. It can be used for the detection of histamine in synthetic media, grape must or wine (white, rose, red) without polyphenols or sugar interferences. This new enzymatic method shows a good correlation (R2 = 0.996, p < 0.001) between the histamine concentrations and absorbances in the interval 0.4-160 mg l(-1).

The objective of this study was to evaluate possible inhibitory effects of grape (a Vitis hybrid Bailey Alicant A) cell culture extract and subfractions on human DNA topoisomerase II catalytic activity and to characterize constituents in the most potent fractions. At 5 microg/mL, grape cell crude extract and Toyopearl (TP) fractions 2-6 provided significantly greater inhibition of topoisomerase II catalytic activity than quercetin, a chemopreventive agent previously known as a topoisomerase catalytic inhibitor. The most potent topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitors from grape cell culture extracts in descending order of potency were TP fractions 4 and 6 (IC(50) = 0.28-0.29 microg/mL), TP-3 (IC(50) = 0.74 microg/mL), and crude extract (IC(50) = 1.02 microg/mL); each was significantly more potent than resveratrol (IC(50) = 18.0 microg/mL), another well-known chemopreventive topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitor. Using both high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, constituents in TP-4 and TP-6 were characterized.

Procyanidin B4, catechin, epicatechin and gallic acid reduced ferricyanide ion and scavenged the stable free radical, alpha, alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) much more effectively than the known antioxidant vitamin ascorbic acid, while epicatechin lactone A, an oxidative derivative of epicatechin, did not reduce ferricyanide ion appreciably at concentrations used and was only about half as effective on free radical-scavenging as epicatechin. Mice spleen cells, when pre-incubated with relatively low concentration of procyanidin B4, catechin or gallic acid, were less susceptible to DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as evaluated by the comet assay. In contrast, noticeable DNA damage was induced in mice spleen cells by incubating with higher concentration (150 microM) of catechin. Collectively, these data suggest that procyanidin B4, catechin, gallic acid were good antioxidants, at low concentration they could prevent oxidative damage to cellular DNA.

15612770,"Dietary supplements such as grape seed extract (GSE) enriched in proanthocyanidins (PA) (oligomeric polyphenols) have been suggested to have multiple health benefits, due to antioxidant and other beneficial activities of the PA. However, a systematic analysis of the molecular basis of these benefits has not been demonstrated. Because the brain is vulnerable to age-related oxidative damage and other insults including inflammation, it was hypothesized that rats ingesting GSE would experience changes in expression or modifications of specific brain proteins that might protect against pathologic events. Normal adult female rats were fed diets supplemented with 5% GSE for 6 weeks. Proteomics analysis (2D electrophoresis and mass spectrometry) of brain homogenates from these animals identified 13 proteins that were altered in amount and/or charge. Because many of these changes were quantitatively in the opposite direction from previous findings for the same proteins in either Alzheimer disease or mouse models of neurodegeneration, the data suggest that these identified proteins may mediate the neuroprotective actions of GSE.

Mepiquat chloride was extracted with water-methanol (1:1). Extracted solution was adjusted to pH 10 with ammonia solution. A part of the extracted solution was cleaned up on a styrenedivinylbenzene (SDVB) cartridge for LC/MS/MS. The LC separation was performed on a C18 column (50 mm x 2 mm i.d.) using 0.1% IPCC-MS7-methanol (60:40) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The mass spectral acquisition was done in the positive ion mode by applying selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The recoveries of mepiquat chloride from fresh grape, wine and juice fortified at 5 microg/kg and 50 microg/kg were 84.5-96.1%. The lower limit of quantification was 1 microg/kg.

No complicated sample preparation was needed, but only a dilution of the extracts. A fast generic gradient elution and wide mass range acquisition was used with good sensitivity. The total analysis time was only 23 min. The ion chromatograms for flavonoid compounds were automatically extracted, and the fragmentation patterns obtained using positive ion mode and exact mass data for both polarities were used for the tentative identification of compounds. Software-based automated searching of molecular ions for flavonoids and their glycosides (xylosides/arabinosides, rhamnosides, glucosides/galactosides) from total ion chromatograms was used. The compounds were quantified using quercetin, quercitrin, rutin and kuromanine as external standards and dextromethorphan as an internal standard.

The findings are somewhat peculiar at first glance, but reasonable explanations can account for the results. The grape proteins identified are less in number, which may be due to the availability of an incomplete database and possibly bentonite fining. The relatively large number of identified yeast proteins may be due to their complete protein database.

Results were compared to those of Zweigelt, the most cultivated Styrian red wine. Bovine coronary artery strips were attached to a force transducer connected to a bridge amplifier, and isometric force was recorded on a multipen recorder. Preincubation of the vessels with the dealcoholized wines (DAW; 330 microl/ml) inhibited the constrictions to histamine and serotonin (5-HT) NO-dependently in the range of 5-80% and 30-90%, respectively (Zweigelt 47% and 90%, respectively). The corresponding GSE (20 mg/ml) inhibited the coronary constrictions to histamine in the range of 40% to 80% (Zweigelt 80%). Additionally, all DAW antagonized the contractile responses to the thromboxane-mimetic U46619 and the isoprostane 8-iso-PGF2alpha, indicating a nonspecific inhibition. To characterize the vasoactive component(s), the Traminer GSE was separated representatively using ultrafiltration, solid phase extraction (SPE) on Isolute C18(EC), and Isolute SCX-2, as well as column chromatography (CC) on polyamide. The resulting fractions were subsequently bioassayed for vasorelaxing activity. Preliminary results refer to a very hydrophilic, nonpolyphenolic basic compound with a MW<1000 Da.

Considering the effects of different wine-making techniques on phenols and the wine consumption preference influencing the benefical effects of the product, organically and non-organically produced wines were obtained from the grapes of Vitis vinifera origin var: Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Grenache, Columbard and Semillon. Levels of total phenols [mg/l gallic acid equivalents (GAE)], antioxidant activity (%) and inhibition of LDL oxidation [%, inhibition of diene and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation] were determined. Some phenolic acids (gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and vanillic acid) were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with an electrochemical detection carried at +0.65 V (versus Ag/AgCl, 0.5 microA full scale). The highest concentrations of gallic, syringic and ferulic acids were found in organic Cabernet Sauvignon; 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid in organic Carignan and p-coumaric and vanillic acids in non-organic Merlot wine. High levels of antioxidant activity (AOA), inhibition of LDL oxidation and total phenol levels were found in non-organic Merlot (101.950% AOA; 88.570% LDL-diene; 41.000% LDL-MDA; 4700.000 mg/l GAE total phenol) and non-organic Cabernet Sauvignon (92.420% AOA; 91.430% LDL-diene; 67.000% LDL-MDA; 3500.000 mg/l GAE total phenol) grape varieties.

Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the pigmented material in this fraction was chiefly composed of direct condensation products of anthocyanin extending up to trimers.

Grape anthocyanins were the glucosylated derivatives of five different anthocyanidin molecules, with or without p-coumaric acid acylation. Bilberry contained five different anthocyanidins glycosylated with galactose, glucose, and arabinose. Chokeberry anthocyanins were cyanidin derivatives, monoglycosylated mostly with galactose and arabinose.

Total resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L (average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties grown at warm climates.

The inhibitory effects of red wine polyphenolics on human breast cancer cells have been demonstrated earlier, but their effects on normal cells have not been fully established. Red wine (Merlot) was fractionated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and different flavonoid fractions with increasing hydrophobicity were obtained. These fractions were tested for their inhibitory effect on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), and a non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cell line. By contrast to the authentic flavonoids such as quercetin, naringenin and catechin which inhibited the growth of HMEC much more than that of MCF-7 cancer cells, a red wine fraction, that was comprised mainly of the flavonoid aglycones, showed maximal inhibition of the growth of breast cancer cells, with relatively low cytotoxicity towards HMEC and MCF-10A cells. In the presence of this flavonoid fraction, the normal cells grew normally, whereas the breast cancer cells underwent a change in morphology into spherical forms. Cytotoxicity analyses suggested that these cells had become apoptotic. The efficiency of inhibition of cell proliferation by various flavonoid fractions appeared to be related to their inhibition of calcium and calmodulin-promoted phosphodiesterase activity, suggesting that flavonoids may interfere with calcium second messenger function.

The sorption process was relatively fast and equilibrium was reached after about 60 min of contact. The influence of pH, sodium chloride and metal concentration on metal removal has been studied. Uptake showed a pH-dependent profile. Maximum sorption for both metals was found to occur at around pH 5.5-6.0. An increase of sodium chloride concentration caused a decrease in metal removal. Langmuir isotherms, at pH 6.0, for each metal were used to describe sorption equilibrium data. Maximum uptake obtained was 1.59x10(-4) mol of copper and 1.81x10(-4) mol of nickel per gram of dry sorbent. Sorption of copper and nickel on grape stalks released an equivalent amount of alkaline and alkaline earth metals (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) and protons, indicating that ionic exchange is predominantly responsible for metal ion uptake. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry analysis indicated that lignin C-O bond might be involved in metal uptake. Equilibrium batch sorption studies were also performed using a two metal system containing (Cu(II)+Ni(II)). In the evaluation of the two metal sorption system performance, single isotherm curves had to be replaced by three-dimensional sorption isotherm surface.

Particular attention is currently being paid to the exploitation of this kind of grape byproducts for obtaining bio-active phenolic compounds with potential application as food antioxidants and preventive agents against cancer and other diseases. In this work, the flavanol composition of various winery byproducts submitted to different degrees of industrial exploitation has been studied and their antioxidant activity determined using two different methods (TBARS and TEAC) to evaluate their interest as suitable sources for the preparation of flavanol-rich antioxidant extracts. All the byproducts studied were still good flavanol sources no matter their exploitation degree. An important conclusion was that dried grape seeds, obtained as an end byproduct after the color extraction and alcohol distillation of the wine pomace, still kept important flavanol concentrations and significant antioxidant activity, even if they were submitted to high temperatures. These byproducts can be considered a cheap source for the extraction of antioxidant flavanols, which can be used as dietary supplements or in the production of phytochemicals.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000975', 'D002851', 'D019587', 'D044948', 'D005511', 'D005638', 'D010936', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Antioxidants', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Flavonols', 'Food Handling', 'Fruit', 'Plant Extracts', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Flavanol content and antioxidant activity in winery byproducts.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14733501,2004

About three hundred spots were detected on the 2-DE map after colloidal blue staining. From 2-DE map of cv. Gamay mesocarp, 67 proteins were identified (p > 0.95) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. About 34%, 19%, and 13% of identified proteins play, respectively, a role in energy metabolism, defense, and stress response and primary metabolism. 2-DE analysis revealed considerable accumulation of dehydrin, invertase, and a putative transcription factor in the ripe fruit, in addition to pathogenesis-related proteins such as chitinase and thaumatin-like proteins previously documented as prevalent proteins in ripe berries. Actual translation of redundant transcripts of unclear function such as Grip31, Grip32, and Grip61 recently cloned in ripe grape berries was confirmed. The relative abundance of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and vacuolar invertase strongly supported a key role of the apoplastic pathway of sugar loading during ripening. Comparative analysis shows that differences between cultivars were low, but different isoforms of alcohol dehydrogenase and of a transcription factor of hexose transporter were obvious in the six cultivars.

For this purpose, two different vineyards from the Douro wine district, Portugal, were selected. Monovarietal grapes from a 10 year old vineyard were used to produce a red table wine, in a very modern winery. Polyvarietal grapes from a 60-70 year old vineyard were used to produce a red fortified wine, similar to Port, through a traditional vinification process. The multielement compositions (Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Hf, Li, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sr, Ti, Th, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zn, Zr, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) of soil, grape juices (prepared in the laboratory), and samples collected in the different steps of each winemaking process were measured. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used, after suitable pretreatment of the samples (by UV irradiation for liquid samples and high-pressure microwave digestion for soil). Both vinification processes influenced the multielement composition of the wines. Most of the elements presented similar or even lower concentrations in the wine as compared to that observed in the respective grape juice, probably as a result of precipitation or coprecipitation with suspended particles during fermentation and/or wine aging. Evidence of effective contamination during grape pressing, fermentation, and/or fining of wines (depending on the element) was observed for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn in the fortified wine and Al, Cr, Fe, Ni, Pb, and V in the table wine. Nevertheless, significant correlations were obtained between the multielement composition of the wine and the respective grape juice (R = 0.997 and 0.979 for the fortified and table wines, respectively, n = 31, P < 0.01), as well as between that in the wine (median of the two studied wines) and the provenance soil (R = 0.994, n = 19, P < 0.01), for the set of elements determined in common in the different types of samples. These results are promising concerning the usefulness of the elemental patterns of both soil and wine as fingerprints of the origin of the studied wines. Nevertheless, more wines from the same and other wine districts must be studied in order to consolidate this conclusion.

14679019,"In breast cancer, in situ estrogen production has been demonstrated to play a major role in promoting tumor growth. Aromatase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgen substrates into estrogens. This enzyme is highly expressed in breast cancer tissue compared with normal breast tissue. A wine extract fraction was recently isolated from red wine that exhibited a potent inhibitory action on aromatase activity. Using UV absorbance analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography profiling, accurate mass-mass spectrometry, and nanospray tandem mass spectrometry, most of the compounds in our red wine fraction were identified as procyanidin B dimers that were shown to be aromatase inhibitors. These chemicals have been found in high levels in grape seeds. Inhibition kinetic analysis on the most potent procyanidin B dimer has revealed that it competes with the binding of the androgen substrate with a K(i) value of 6 micro M. Because mutations at Asp-309, Ser-378, and His-480 of aromatase significantly affected the binding of the procyanidin B dimer, these active site residues are thought to be important residues that interact with this phytochemical. The in vivo efficacy of procyanidin B dimers was evaluated in an aromatase-transfected MCF-7 breast cancer xenograft model. The procyanidin B dimers were able to reduce androgen-dependent tumor growth, indicating that these chemicals suppress in situ estrogen formation. These in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that procyanidin B dimers in red wine and grape seeds could be used as chemopreventive agents against breast cancer by suppressing in situ estrogen biosynthesis.",Cancer research,"['D000818', 'D016588', 'D001141', 'D047072', 'D044946', 'D002392', 'D002851', 'D019281', 'D004791', 'D004965', 'D004967', 'D005260', 'D007700', 'D013058', 'D051379', 'D008807', 'D008819', 'D016297', 'D044945', 'D012639', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents', 'Aromatase', 'Aromatase Inhibitors', 'Biflavonoids', 'Catechin', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Estrogens', 'Female', 'Kinetics', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Seeds', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Suppression of estrogen biosynthesis by procyanidin dimers in red wine and grape seeds.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000096', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'genetics', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'biosynthesis', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14679019,2004

12884388,"Mass spectrometry, had and still has, a very important role for research and quality control in the viticulture and enology field, and its analytical power is relevant for structural studies on aroma and polyphenolic compounds. Polyphenols are responsible for the taste and color of wine, and confer astringency and structure to the beverage. The knowledge of the anthocyanic structure is very important to predict the aging attitude of wine, and to attempt to resolve problems about color stability. Moreover, polyphenols are the main compounds related to the benefits of wine consumption in the diet, because of their properties in the treatment of circulatory disorders such as capillary fragility, peripheral chronic venous insufficiency, and microangiopathy of the retina. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) techniques are nowadays the best analytical approach to study polyphenols in grape extracts and wine, and are the most effective tool in the study of the structure of anthocyanins. The MS/MS approach is a very powerful tool that permits anthocyanin aglycone and sugar moiety characterization. LC-MS allows the characterization of complex structures of grape polyphenols, such as procyanidins, proanthocyanidins, prodelphinidins, and tannins, and provides experimental evidence for structures that were previously only hypothesized.

Mature Moscatel grapes were harvested in the same vineyard in two consecutive years, 1999 and 2000. The grapes exhibited widely distinct polypeptide patterns when analyzed by either FPLC cation exchange chromatography or two-dimensional electrophoresis: whrereas the 2000 grapes possessed a much higher protein content (1.96 versus 1.11 mg g(-)(1) of fresh weight), the 1999 grapes contained a greater heterogeneity of polypeptides. In addition, highly specific antibodies that recognize the pathogenesis-related proteins present in the grapes demonstrated that the 2000 harvest grapes had a wider variety of pathogenesis-related polypeptides. N-Terminal sequencing of the major polypeptides revealed differences in the relative abundance and amino acid sequence of thaumatin-like and osmotin-like polypeptides present in the 1999 and 2000 harvest Moscatel grapes and did not detect the presence of chitinase.

12797479,"A large body of evidence supports the key role of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to compare the capacity of natural polyphenols (PP) from Vitis vinifera and Olea europea at protecting LDL against oxidation brought about by Cu2+, oxygen-centered radical-generating AAPH, or peroxynitrite-generating SIN-1 in vitro systems, or at impairing superoxide production in promonocyte cells (THP-1) conveniently differentiated into adherent macrophages. PP were either from the whole grape (fraction A) containing mainly procyanidins, (epi)-catechin and anthocyanins, or from grape seed extracts (fractions B and C) consisting of tannins and procyanidin oligomers with a higher content in B than in C, or from a grape skin extract (fraction D) consisting mainly of anthocyanins, or from a hydrosoluble olive mill wastewater PP extract (fraction E) containing hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein. Chlorogenic acid (F) and catechin (G) were taken as archetypes of PP preventing oxidation partly as copper scavenger and as radical scavenger only, respectively. All grape fractions were efficient towards Cu2+ system (equally or more efficient than F), whereas they were rather poorly efficient towards AAPH and SIN-1 (less efficient than G but as efficient as F). Among the PP fractions, B was the most effective at protecting LDL in the SIN-1 system and at impairing THP-1 superoxide production. Taken together, these data suggest that the PP fraction from grape seed rich in procyanidins achieves the best compromise between the direct and indirect (i.e. cell-mediated) types of action in protecting LDL against oxidation, strengthening the need for improving the knowledge of its bioavailability in humans.",Free radical research,"['D000578', 'D000975', 'D002392', 'D002460', 'D003300', 'D005419', 'D006801', 'D008077', 'D008981', 'D009000', 'D031658', 'D016877', 'D010084', 'D018384', 'D010636', 'D010936', 'D059808', 'D012639', 'D013050', 'D013481', 'D013997', 'D027843']","['Amidines', 'Antioxidants', 'Catechin', 'Cell Line', 'Copper', 'Flavonoids', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL', 'Molsidomine', 'Monocytes', 'Olea', 'Oxidants', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phenols', 'Plant Extracts', 'Polyphenols', 'Seeds', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Superoxides', 'Time Factors', 'Vitis']","Grape and grape seed extract capacities at protecting LDL against oxidation generated by Cu2+, AAPH or SIN-1 and at decreasing superoxide THP-1 cell production.

The study was carried out using gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) to detect the potentially most important aroma compounds, which were then analyzed quantitatively by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The strongest odorants in the GC-O experiments were similar in all cases, although significant differences in intensity between samples were noted. Calculation of the odor activity values (OAVs) showed that 3-mercaptohexyl acetate was the most active odorant in the Marmajuelo and Verdello wines, as were 3-methylbutyl acetate in the Gual wine, beta-damascenone in the Malvasia wine, and ethyl octanoate in the white Listán wine. However, the most important differences between varieties were caused by the three mercaptans (3-mercaptohexyl acetate, 3-mercaptohexanol, and 4-methyl-4-mercapto-2-pentanone) and the vinylphenols (4-vinylphenol and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol).

The expression of nsLTP genes was investigated in 41B-rootstock grape cell suspension, in response to various defense-related signal molecules. Ergosterol (a fungi-specific sterol) and a proteinaceous elicitor purified from Botrytis cinerea strongly and rapidly induced the accumulation of nsLTP mRNAs. Jasmonic acid, cholesterol, and sitosterol also promoted nsLTPs mRNA accumulation, although to a lesser extent, whereas salicylic acid had no effect. High performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that the amounts of three LTP isoforms (previously named P1, P2, and P4) were increased by ergosterol. None of the four isoforms displayed any significant antifungal properties, with the exception of the P4 isoform, which reduced Botrytis mycelium growth in vitro, but only in calcium-free medium.

Two vineyards from the Douro Portuguese region and two types of wine, one red table wine, which has been produced in a very modern winery, and one red fortified wine (similar to Port), which has been produced by a traditional vinification process, were selected for this study. Aerosols from the vineyards atmosphere, vineyard soil, vine leaves, grapes, and samples from the intermediary and final wine product were collected. Suitable pretreatments, namely, high-pressure microwave assisted digestion (soil, leaves, and grapes) and UV-irradiation (grape juices and samples from the different steps of the vinification processes), were used. The samples were analyzed in terms of lead total concentration and respective isotope ratios by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and atomic absorption spectrophotometry with electrothermal atomization. It was observed that the major sources of lead were in the vinification system, the more traditional one introducing more lead than the modern one. For the fortified wine, the lead concentration increased from 4.7 microg L(-1), in the grape juice, to 17.2 microg L(-1), in the final product, while for the table wine the increase was from 4.1 to 13.1 microg L(-)(1). Therefore, only about 1/4 (fortified wine) and 1/3 (table wine) of the lead total content of the final products came from soil and atmospheric deposition. Therefore, it is expected that marked reductions of the lead content in the wines would occur if the sources of lead were removed from the tubes and containers used in the vinification system, particularly by using welding alloys and small fittings free of lead.

Nine phenolic compounds, that is, trans-p-coumaric and trans-caftaric acids, trans-resveratrol glucoside, cis-coutaric, trans-coutaric, cis-p-coumaric, and cis-caftaric acids, tryptophol, and syringic acid, permit the wines to be classified correctly in accordance with the grape variety from which they were manufactured.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002851', 'D003373', 'D005419', 'D062385', 'D013058', 'D008970', 'D010636', 'D012441', 'D013045', 'D013267', 'D013997', 'D027843', 'D014920']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Flavonoids', 'Hydroxybenzoates', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phenols', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Species Specificity', 'Stilbenes', 'Time Factors', 'Vitis', 'Wine']",Study of low molecular weight phenolic compounds during the aging of sparkling wines manufactured with red and white grape varieties.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12643678,2003

Rubired and Salvador grapes are hybrids from Vitis vinifera and Vitis rupestris. Concord grape is a grape from the native American cultivar Vitis labrusca. Individual anthocyanins in these three varieties were identified on the basis of UV-vis and MS spectra and further elucidated by MS/MS spectra. Anthocyanins in Salvador and Concord grapes were 3-O-glucosides, 3-O-(6' '-O-p-coumaroyl)glucosides, 3-O-(6' '-O-p-acetyl)glucosides, 3,5-O-diglucosides, and 3-O-(6' '-O-p-coumaroyl)-5-O-diglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin. Vitisin B was detected in Salvador grape juice. Anthocyanins in Rubired grape juice were primarily anthocyanin diglucosides: peonidin 3,5-O-diglucoside, malvidin 3,5-O-diglucoside, peonidin 3-O-(6' '-O-p-coumaroyl)-5-O-diglucoside, and malvidin 3-O-(6' '-O-p-coumaroyl)-5-O-diglucoside are the four major anthocyanins.

12601742,"Oligomeric procyanidins are potent antioxidant polyphenols of potential interest as disease-preventing agents. Their efficiency depends on the size and composition of their oligomeric structures. The mean degree of polymerization of these compounds is usually estimated by thiolysis with thiol-alpha-toluene followed by analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We show the development of a mixed micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method for the separation of the major components obtained after thiolysis with cysteamine (catechins and their cysteamine conjugates). MEKC studies using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS as pseudostationary phase led to long migration times, e.g., with 100 mM SDS, at pH 7, the solutes were separated in about 40 min), while the use of sodium cholate (SC) produced an elution window relatively short. Using a mixed micellar SC-SDS system (50 mM phosphate at pH 7 containing 40 mM SC and 10 mM SDS), it is possible to separate these compounds in less than 15 min.

Fluorescence microscopy revealed accumulation of phenolics in the skin of berries and, by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids were identified as the main groups of UV-absorbing phenolics. Relationships between natural radiation and the synthesis of phenolics were studied in plants that were cultivated in the absence of UV radiation in a greenhouse before outdoor exposure to three different light regimes: the entire solar spectrum, the solar spectrum minus UV-B radiation and only visible radiation. During six days of exposure, flavonol synthesis was significantly stimulated by natural UV, in particular UV-B, but concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids decreased under all conditions. Direct comparison of fluorimetrically-determined skin absorbance with absorbance of extracted flavonols or hydroxycinnamic acids suggested that acclimation of UV screening depends almost exclusively on flavonol synthesis. While increased flavonol levels resulted in efficient UV-A shielding, UV-B shielding was incomplete, probably due to decreased levels of the UV-B-absorbing hydroxycinnamic acids during exposure.",Functional plant biology : FPB,[],[],UV screening by phenolics in berries of grapevine (Vitis vinifera).,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32689099,2020

We postulated that combining extracts of grape seed (GSD) and grape skin (GSK), primary sources of grape polyphenolics, individually shown to inhibit PA, might enhance their individual antiplatelet effects. This hypothesis was examined in vitro (human platelets) and ex vivo (dog platelets) by studying the effects of the extracts on collagen-induced whole blood PA. In vitro, threshold concentration of only GSD, individually incubated with blood, significantly inhibited PA; PA was inhibited by 12.7 +/- 3.5% (P < or = 0.01). No significant changes in Pa were observed with threshold concentrations of GSK, used individually. In two dose combinations, GSD and GSK inhibited PA 40.5 +/- 10.1% (P < or = 0.005) and 96.5 +/- 3.1% (P < or = 0.001). In the ex vivo study, seven dogs were fed threshold doses of GSD or GSK individually, in combination or in combination with a proprietary enzyme blend (EB; thought to enhance bioavailability) for 8 d.

However, skin retains the capacity for brisk initiation of angiogenesis during inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and skin cancers. We sought to test the effects of multiple berry extracts on inducible VEGF expression by human HaCaT keratinocytes. Six berry extracts (wild blueberry, bilberry, cranberry, elderberry, raspberry seed, and strawberry) and a grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) were studied. The extracts and uptake of their constituents by HaCaT were studied using a multi-channel HPLC-CoulArray approach. Antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined by ORAC. Cranberry, elderberry and raspberry seed samples were observed to possess comparable ORAC values. The antioxidant capacity of these samples was significantly lower than that of the other samples studied. The ORAC values of strawberry powder and GSPE were higher than cranberry, elderberry or raspberry seed but significantly lower than the other samples studied. Wild bilberry and blueberry extracts possessed the highest ORAC values. Each of the berry samples studied significantly inhibited both H2O2 as well as TNF alpha induced VEGF expression by the human keratinocytes.

12428978,"We have investigated the inhibitory effects of polyphenols from natural products, such as green tea, bilberry, grape, ginkgo, and apple, on rainbow trout gelatinase activities. Gelatinases from the skin, muscle, and blood of rainbow trout contained serine proteinase, metalloproteinase, and other proteinase activities as measured by gelatin zymography. The polyphenols of green tea caused the strong inhibition of some gelatinase activities when compared with those of the other products. This inhibition was quite similar to that of metalloproteinase by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, suggesting that the effects of green tea polyphenols on proteinase activities are specific for metalloproteinases.

Evaluation of carboxylic acids requires the study and optimization of some operative variables which are strictly related to the matrix. In particular, the determination of organic acids in real matrixes such as Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale of Modena (ABTM; a traditional balsamic vinegar made from cooked grape must) is often difficult because of the presence of numerous interferences that need to be removed by separation techniques. To this aim, in the present work a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method with C18 and NH(2) exchangers was used to clean the ABTM samples prior to analysis or further treatments. Both HPLC and GC techniques were used to determine organic acids. The efficiency of these two different analytical techniques in the study of ABTM acidic composition has been evaluated. Both methods separately were not able to supply all the data related to carboxylic acids. In particular, HPLC allows acetic and lactic acids quantification, but gluconic and succinic acids are better determined by GC.

12180694,"This paper describes a study of the different methods of sample preparation for the determination of calcium in grape juice, wines, and other alcoholic beverages by flame atomic absorption spectrometry; results are also reported for the practical application of these methods to the analysis of commercial samples produced in Spain. The methods tested included dealcoholization, dry mineralization, and wet mineralization with heating by using different acids and/or mixtures of acids. The sensitivity, detection limit, accuracy, precision, and selectiviy of each method were established. Such research is necessary because of the better analytical indexes obtained after acid digestion of the sample, as recommended by the European Union, which advocates the direct method. In addition, although high-temperature mineralization with an HNO3-HCIO4 mixture gave the best analytical results, mineralization with nitric acid at 80 degrees C for 15 min gave the most satisfactory results in all cases, including those for wines with high levels of sugar and beverages with high alcoholic content. The results for table wines subjected to the latter treatment had an accuracy of 98.70-99.90%, a relative standard deviation of 2.46%, a detection limit of 19.0 microg/L, and a determination limit of 31.7 microg/L. The method was found to be sufficiently sensitive and selective. It was applied to the determination of Ca in grape juice, different types of wines, and beverages with high alcoholic content, all of which are produced and widely consumed in Spain.

Sediments are considered quality defects in muscadine grape products, and their presence may influence consumer acceptability and expansion of retail markets. Processing regimes included both hot (70 degrees C) and cold (25 degrees C) press techniques for wine or juice production, and fermentations in contact with grape skins for 3, 5, and 7 days. Relationships between free ellagic acid (FE), total ellagitannins (ET), and total ellagic acid (TE) concentrations were evaluated initially in each product and in sediments that formed during storage for 50 and 120 days at 20 degrees C. Processing techniques influenced initial concentrations of these compounds and the extent of sediment formation. Following storage, juices generally had higher concentrations of FE in sediments compared to wines, but sedimentation was independent of initial FE or TE concentrations. Decreases in ET were observed for hot-pressed juice and skin-fermented wines after storage indicating their hydrolysis during storage and possible contribution to FE in sediments. However, quantitative analysis of the collected sediments revealed that no more than 12% FE by weight was actually present in the sediments, with the remainder consisting of either unidentified compounds or conjugated forms of ellagic acid.

The development of the fungus at the surface of the berries leads to the occurrence of a very characteristic and sometimes intense mushroom-type odor cited as an important default for grapes quality. Gas chromatography/olfactometry, gas chromatography, and multidimensional gas chromatogaphy/mass spectrometry techniques were used to investigate the most important odorants of grapes diseased by powdery mildew. Among 22 odorants detected, strongly odorant compounds were identified or tentatively identified in purified extracts obtained from grapes diseased by powdery mildew. Aroma extraction dilution analysis (AEDA) analysis revealed that 1-octen-3-one (mushroom odor), (Z)-1,5-octadien-3-one (geranium-leaf odor), and an unidentified odorous zone (fishy-mushroom like odor) were the most potent volatiles of the diseased grapes. In the presence of nonproliferating Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells, and consequently during alcoholic fermentation, the enzymatic reduction of 1-octen-3-one and (Z)-1,5-octadien-3-one to much less odorant compounds, namely 3-octanone and (Z)-5-octen-3-one, was shown.

Juices and wines were produced by hot- and cold-pressed techniques, and additional wine was produced following on-hull fermentation for 3, 5, and 7 days. Chromatographic conditions were developed to simultaneously separate anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and flavonols and correlated to a measurement of overall antioxidant capacity (AOX), and their changes were monitored after storage for 60 days at 20 and 37 degrees C. Regression coefficients between concentrations of individual polyphenolics and AOX ranged from 0.55 for ellagic acid to 0.90 for kaempferol. Both red and white wines had higher AOX values after storage than juices made from an identical grape press, despite lower concentrations of individual polyphenolic compounds. Red wines fermented on-hull had higher initial concentrations of antioxidant polyphenolics as compared to a corresponding hot-pressed juice, but changes in AOX during storage were more affected by time than by storage temperature despite lower concentrations of flavonoids and ellagic acid present at 37 degrees C as compared to 20 degrees C. Oxidative or polymerization reactions significantly decreased levels of monomeric anthocyanins during storage with the greatest losses observed for delphinidin and petunidin 3,5-diglucosides.

Eleven amino acid compositions imitating the characteristic amino acid profile of 11 different grape varieties were tested. Significant differences in the levels of some important volatile compounds (ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, higher alcohols and some of their acetates, methionol, isobutyric acid, ethyl butyrate, and hexanoic and octanoic acids) were found. The levels of some of the volatile compounds are well correlated with the aromatic composition of wines made with grapes of the same varieties. A multiple linear regression study produced good models for most of the odorants for which the level was related to the must amino acid composition. Partial least-squares regression models confirm that amino acid composition explains a high proportion of the variance in the volatile composition and show that the relationship between both sets of variables is highly multivariate. According to the different models, the levels of some byproducts of fatty acid synthesis are related to threonine and serine, the level of beta-phenyletanol is closely related to the level of phenylalanine, and methionol is strongly correlated to the must methionine contents.

Grape plant cell cultures were used to purify 12 phenols: the stilbenoids trans-astringin, trans-piceid (2), trans-resveratroloside, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceatannol, cis-resveratroloside, cis-piceid, and cis-resveratrol; the flavans (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and epicatechin 3-O-gallate; and the flavan dimer procyanidin B2 3'-O-gallate. These compounds were evaluated for potential to inhibit cyclooxygenases and preneoplastic lesion formation in carcinogen-treated mouse mammary glands in organ culture. At 10 micrograms/ml, trans-astringin and trans-piceatannol inhibited development of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced preneoplastic lesions in mouse mammary glands with 68.8% and 76.9% inhibition, respectively, compared with untreated glands. The latter compound was the most potent of the 12 compounds tested in this assay, with the exception of trans-resveratrol (87.5% inhibition). In the cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 assay, trans isomers of the stilbenoids appear to be more active than cis isomers: trans-resveratrol [50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 14.9 microM, 96%] vs. cis-resveratrol (IC50 = 55.4 microM). In the COX-2 assay, among the compounds tested, only trans- and cis-resveratrol exhibited significant inhibitory activity (IC50 = 32.2 and 50.2 microM, respectively). This is the first report showing the potential cancer-chemopreventive activity of trans-astringin, a plant stilbenoid recently found in wine. trans-Astringin and its aglycone trans-piceatannol were active in the mouse mammary gland organ culture assay but did not exhibit activity in COX-1 and COX-2 assays. trans-Resveratrol was active in all three of the bioassays used in this investigation.

11804508,"Resveratrol is an antioxidant found in grapes, grape products, and some other botanical sources with antiinflammatory and anticancer properties. In grapes and wine, it occurs both as free resveratrol and piceid, the 3beta-glucoside of resveratrol. Here we report a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method to analyze total resveratrol (including free resveratrol and resveratrol from piceid) in fruit products and wine. Samples were extracted using methanol, enzymatically hydrolyzed, and analyzed using reversed phase HPLC with positive ion atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mass spectrometric detection. Following APCI, the abundance of protonated molecules was recorded using selected ion monitoring (SIM) of m/z 229. An external standard curve was used for quantitation, which showed a linear range of 0.52-2260 pmol of trans-resveratrol injected on-column with a correlation coefficient 0.9999. The coefficient of variance of the response factor over the same concentration range was determined to be 5.8%, and the intra-assay coefficient of variance was determined to be 4.2% (n = 7). The limit of quantitation, defined as signal-to-noise 10:1, was determined to be 0.31 pmol injected on-column. The extraction efficiency of the method was determined to be 92%. The stability of resveratrol under different conditions was also examined. For example, resveratrol was stable for up to 5 days at 4 degrees C in the dark but was not stable at room temperature without protection from light. Resveratrol was detected in grape, cranberry, and wine samples. Concentrations ranged from 1.56 to 1042 nmol/g in Concord grape products, and from 8.63 to 24.84 micromol/L in Italian red wine.

Representative Greek, single-variety, aged red wines were examined for total phenol, total flavanol, and total anthocyanin content using spectrophotometry, and attempts were made to establish correlations with the antiradical, reducing, and hydroxyl free radical scavenging activity. In addition, HPLC analyses were carried out, to ascertain whether individual polyphenols are actually responsible for the antioxidant effects of aged red wines. It was found that total flavanols are the class of polyphenols that account for hydroxyl free radical scavenging efficacy and to a lesser extent for antiradical and reducing ability, whereas there was a less significant link between the antioxidant properties and the total phenolics and only a weak relationship to total anthocyanin content. The correlation of the antioxidant properties with the principal polyphenols showed that individual compounds are weakly associated with all the antioxidant parameters, suggesting that the expression of antioxidant activity in aged red wines is rather a consequence of synergism between various phenolics, and it is not simply attributed to specific constituents.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000975', 'D002851', 'D005419', 'D005511', 'D010636', 'D011108', 'D059808', 'D012680', 'D013045', 'D013997', 'D014920']","['Antioxidants', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flavonoids', 'Food Handling', 'Phenols', 'Polymers', 'Polyphenols', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Species Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Wine']",Effect of principal polyphenolic components in relation to antioxidant characteristics of aged red wines.,"[None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'methods', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11743756,2002

Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization/time of flight-mass spectrometry analysis, the amino acid composition, and the N-terminal sequence of purified GvP1 identified it as an 89.9-kD extensin. Analysis of cell walls following the in situ insolubilization of GvP1 indicates large and specific increases in the major amino acids of GvP1 as compared with the amino acids present in salt-eluted cell walls. We calculate that following deposition, covalently bound GvP1 contributes up to 4% to 5% of the cell wall dry weight. The deposition of GvP1 in situ requires peroxide and endogenous peroxidase activity. Isoelectric focusing of saline eluates of callus revealed only a few basic peroxidases that were all isolated or purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. In vitro and in situ assays of extensin cross-linking activity using GvP1 and peroxidases showed that a 40-kD peroxidase cross-linked GvP1 within minutes, whereas other grapevine peroxidases had no significant activity with GvP1. Internal peptide sequences indicated this extensin peroxidase (EP) is a member of the class III peroxidases.

The method is based on the combination of four main parameters: irradiation power (IW), irradiation time (IT), irradiation distance (ID), and number of elapsed days to achieve the highest resveratrol accumulation (D(m)). Maximum resveratrol content (11-fold higher than untreated grapes) was achieved using the combination: IW = 510 W, IT = 30 s, ID = 40 cm, and D(m) = 3 days. Sensory characteristics and main features of irradiated grapes (color, weight, firmness, flavor, size, ripening index and vitamin C content) remained unaltered after 1 week of storage. UV induction signal migrated to the hidden side of the grape skin with a delay of 3 days as compared to the directly irradiated side. Phenolic compounds were not detected in Napoleon grape flesh. Resveratrol content per standard serving (200 g) of irradiated grape was about 3 mg, an amount more than 10-fold higher than that of untreated Napoleon grapes. This means that a serving of irradiated grape (unpeeled) could supply the resveratrol content equivalent to 3 glasses of a red wine with high resveratrol content ( approximately 1 mg/glass).

Sixty-nine different odor regions were detected in the GC-O profiles of wines, 63 of which could be identified. GC-O data have been processed to calculate averaged flavor dilution factors (FD). Different ANOVA strategies have been further applied on FD and on intensity data to check for significant differences among wines and to assess the effects of dilution and the judge. Data show that FD and the average intensity of the odorants are strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.892). However, the measurement of intensity represents a quantitative advantage in terms of detecting differences. For some odorants, dilution exerts a critical role in the detection of differences.

Several other glycosidases were measured at different stages of fruit development but none showed the increased levels of activity displayed by this alpha-galactosidase. alpha-Galactosidase activity (unit/g.fresh wt) increased by 52% during postharvest storage, whereas the unripe grape showed a ""stagnancy"" for 10-15 days prior to the increase. An alpha-galactosidase was partially purified ca. 103-fold from grape flesh of Vitis labruscana Honey black, by a procedure involving ammonium sulfate fractionation, Biogel P-60, melibiose-agarose, and Sephacryl S-200 chromatographic separations. The enzyme was effectively separated by affinity chromatography on melibiose-agarose, and was a monomer of 40-45 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and Sephacryl S-200 chromatographic analysis. The hydrolysis rate of p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-Gal (PNP-alpha-D-Gal) was 4.2 times higher than that of PNP-beta-D-Gal, implying an apparent alpha-anomer specificity, and natural oligosaccharides such as melibiose, stachyose, and raffinose were also considerably hydrolyzed. The enzyme was active over a narrow pH range with an optimal hydrolysis of stachyose and PNP-alpha-D-Gal at pH 6.0 and 7.0, respectively.

11394716,"Anthocyanins are a group of very efficient bioactive compounds that are widely distributed in plant food. Several fruits (blackcurrant, blackberry, red grape) and some vegetables (eggplant, onion, red radish) are rich sources of these natural pigments. Extracts of some of them are used as food colorants as well as components of pharmaceutical preparations and functional foods. Anthocyanins, through their ability to inhibit radical reactions, are considered to exert several protective effects in the human body. Until now there has been only a small amount of data available on their capability, in intact or metabolized form, to reach the systemic circulation of humans. The present study was designed to determine the potential bioavailability in humans of the most important anthocyanins of blackcurrants: delphinidine-3-glucoside, delphinidine-3-rutinoside, cyanidine-3-glucoside, and cyanidine-3-rutinoside. Urinary samples from 4 healthy volunteers (2 women and 2 men) were collected before (baseline) and over a period of 5 hours with intervals of 30 minutes after the ingestion of 200 mL of blackcurrant juice (containing 153 mg of anthocyanins). Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), it was possible to quantify the 4 main anthocyanins of blackcurrants, excreted unchanged in the urine (0.020-0.050% of the oral doses).

It was examined by electron microscope and studied during the fermentation of grape must for batch wine-making. The immobilized yeast showed an important operational stability without any decrease of its activity even at low temperatures (1-12 degrees C). Specifically, at 6 degrees C the biocatalyst favored wine production within 8 days, which is less time than is required for the natural fermentation of grape must. At 1 degrees C wine production was effected in 1 month. This speeding up of the fermentation could be accepted and adopted by the industry for scaling up the wine-making process. Total and volatile acidities were similar to those found in dry wines. The concentrations of higher alcohols (propanol-1 and isobutyl alcohol) were low. The presence of amyl alcohols proved to be temperature dependent and decreased with the temperature decrease. The values of ethyl acetate concentrations were relatively high, up to 154 mg/L. This probably contributes to the fruity aroma and excellent taste of the produced wines. There was no indication of vinegar odor in the product given that the volatile acidity was <0.47 g of acetic acid/L.

Although the PR proteins in juices of grapes are highly conserved, small consistent differences in molecular masses were noted when otherwise identical proteins were compared from different varieties. These differences persisted through different harvest years and in fruits grown in different Australian locations. With the definition of four different masses for PR-5 proteins (range = 21,239--21,272 Da) and nine different masses of PR-3 proteins (range = 25,330--25,631 Da) and using statistical analysis, the methods developed could be used for varietal differentiation of grapes grown in several South Australian locations on the basis of the PR protein composition of the juice.

The stability of some colorants has been studied in sugar and non-sugar drink models at three pH values (3, 4, and 5) under thermal and light conditions simulating rapid food aging. At a given pH, color stability mainly depends on the structures of anthocyanins and of colorless phenolic compounds. Colorants rich in acylated anthocyanins (purple carrot, red radish, and red cabbage) display great stability due to intramolecular copigmentation. The protection of red chromophore is higher for diacylated anthocyanins in red radish and red cabbage. For colorants without acylated anthocyanins (grape-marc, elderberry, black currant, and chokeberry), intermolecular copigmentation plays a key role in color protection. Colorants rich in flavonols and with the highest copigment/pigment ratio show a remarkable stability.

Radicals in the product, quantified by direct measurement by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry, developed similarly to headspace ethane, pentane, and hexanal, and to oxygen depletion both in unprotected and protected products. The ESR signal intensity and headspace hexanal both correlated with the sensory descriptor ""rancidity"" as evaluated by a trained sensory panel.

11087482,"An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and most of the berries.

11043603,"Besides erythema and sunburn reactions, UVB stress can promote erythrocyte extravasation from skin capillaries and hemolysis, and photosensitized hemoglobin can in turn lead to an overload of free radicals in dermis which exacerbates photodamage. The objective of this study was to investigate in rat erythrocytes (RBC) the pattern of events leading to membrane peroxidation and hemolysis following UVB insult (1.5-8.5 J/cm2), and the protective action of grape seed procyanidins. UVB causes a dramatic dose-dependent decrease of intracellular glutathione (paralleled by the formation of pro-oxidant ferryl-hemoglobin), of intramembrane vitamin E and of membrane fluidity, then a rise of conjugated dienes (CD), and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and finally a strong hemolytic effect. Procyanidins prevent membrane peroxidation (but not intracellular GSH depletion nor ferryl-hemoglobin formation), with a minimal effective concentration of 0.1 microM (IC50 for TBARS and CD after 120 min UVB exposure: 0.71 microM and 0.56 microM) and dose-dependently delay the onset of hemolysis, by 30 min at 0.1 mciroM, by 90 and 120 min at 0.5 and 1.0 microM. Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) and catechin, typical constituents of the fraction, were significantly less potent. This since procyanidins (1 microM) inhibit the formation of phospholipid hydroperoxides of the inner (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine) and outer (phosphatidylcholine) layers of the RBC membrane (HPLC analysis), suppress the decrease in membrane fluidity due to lipid and protein thiol oxidation and spare vitamin E from consumption in a dose-dependent manner (0.1-1 microM). Hence procyanidins, preserving membrane phospholipids, since their strong antilipoperoxidant activity, may maintain in vivo the integrity of RBC in sub-epidermal capillaries and effectively counteract in dermis the onset/exacerbation of the UVB-induced skin photodamage.",Life sciences,"['D000818', 'D000975', 'D044946', 'D002392', 'D002851', 'D004305', 'D004910', 'D004912', 'D005978', 'D006454', 'D006461', 'D015227', 'D008297', 'D008560', 'D016877', 'D010084', 'D010743', 'D044945', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D019685', 'D017392', 'D014466', 'D014810']","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Biflavonoids', 'Catechin', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythrocyte Membrane', 'Erythrocytes', 'Glutathione', 'Hemoglobins', 'Hemolysis', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Oxidants', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phospholipids', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Rosales', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Vitamin E']",UVB-induced hemolysis of rat erythrocytes: protective effect of procyanidins from grape seeds.,"[None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000031', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000009', 'Q000378']","[None, 'pharmacology', None, 'analogs & derivatives', None, None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'adverse effects', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11043603,2000

10721116,"Tryptophan (TRP) and its metabolites are considered as potential precursors of 2-aminoacetophenone (AAP) in different food products causing different off-flavors. AAP is also responsible for the ""untypical aging flavor (UTA)"" in wine, developing a floor polish-like flavor in white wines within a few months of storage. In this study the formation of AAP was elucidated by GC-MS analysis of volatile components in model systems, grape musts and wines, spiked with TRP and different TRP metabolites like indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and sulfite. In sulfurized wines and model solutions which were stored at different temperatures (20 degrees C, 45 degrees C) formylaminoacetophenone (FAP) and AAP were formed mainly from IAA with formation rates up to 20 mole%. Minor formation rates of AAP (< 1 mole%) were found in sulfurized solutions of TRP, indole-3-lactic acid, and indole-3-pyruvic acid. The results showed that the formation of AAP in wine can be referred to an oxidative degradation of IAA by superoxide- and hydroxyl-radicals, which can be formed in wine after the sulfuration by cooxidation of sulfite to sulfate. After decarboxylation, pyrrole oxidation, and ring cleavage, FAP was the main volatile compound of the nonenzymatic degradation of IAA by sulfite which was quantitatively hydrolyzed to AAP. The formation of AAP and FAP was significantly lower in white wines than in ethanolic solutions spiked with IAA. However AAP formation rates of up to 5 mole% were still enough for an UTA. Due to the fact that the AAP- and UTA-formation by cooxidation of sulfite and IAA was completely blocked in red wines, it could be deduced that polyphenolic compounds, typical for red wines, have a scavenger effect on the radical oxidation of sulfite.

10606539,"The changes in amino acid composition that occur with maturity of the Noble cultivar of the Vitis rotundifolia Michx. (muscadine) grape were determined by HPLC. Eighteen amino acids were identified. Histidine was the most prominent amino acid followed by alanine. The concentrations of most of the major amino acids (alanine, glycine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, aspartic acid, and serine) were highest at verasion. Glutamine and threonine contents dropped sharply after fruit set, while those of arginine and proline increased gradually with maturity and ripening. Tyrosine content increased gradually with maturity and ripening following a slight drop after fruit set. In ripe grapes, seeds contained most of the amino acids in mature grapes (50%) followed by the pulp (23%), the juice (15%), and the skin (11%). Alanine, histidine, and arginine were the principal amino acids identified in the juice. Alanine, histidine, arginine, valine, glutamine, aspartic acid, proline, serine, and threonine accounted for about 90% of the amino acids in the pulp. In seeds, alanine, proline, asparagine, and histidine accounted for over 55% of the amino acids, while alanine and histidine were found to be the predominant free amino acids in the skin.

Proanthocyanidin-rich extract from grape seeds was administered by intragastric intubation to fasted rats at 250 mg/kg of body weight. The plasma obtained from water- or proanthocyanidin-administered rats was oxidized by incubation with copper sulfate or 2, 2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) at 37 degrees C, and the formation of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides (CE-OOH) was followed. The plasma obtained from proanthocyanidin-administered rats was significantly more resistant against both copper ion-induced and AAPH-induced formation of CE-OOH than that from control rats. The lag phase in the copper ion-induced oxidation of rat plasma was remarkably increased at 15 min after administration of proanthocyanidins and reached a maximum level at 30 min. When the plasma from proanthocyanidin-administered rat was hydrolyzed by sulfatase and beta-glucuronidase following analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, metabolites of proanthocyanidins occurred in rat plasma at 15 min after administration, three peaks of which were identified as gallic acid, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin.

Concentrations of inorganic arsenic in food have not been not well characterized. Accurate dietary intake estimates for inorganic arsenic are needed to support studies of arsenic's status as an essential nutrient, and to establish background levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic. In the market basket survey reported here, 40 commodities anticipated to provide at least 90% of dietary inorganic arsenic intake were identified. Four samples of each commodity were collected. Total arsenic was analysed using an NaOH digestion and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Separate aliquots were analysed for arsenic species using an HCl digestion and hydride atomic absorption spectroscopy. Consistent with earlier studies, total arsenic concentrations (all concentrations reported as elemental arsenic per tissue wet weight) were highest in the seafoods sampled (ranging from 160 ng/g in freshwater fish to 2360 ng/g in saltwater fish). In contrast, average inorganic arsenic in seafood ranged from less than 1 ng/g to 2 ng/g. The highest inorganic arsenic values were found in raw rice (74 ng/g), followed by flour (11 ng/g), grape juice (9 ng/g) and cooked spinach (6 ng/g).

For qualitative and quantitative analysis, reversed-phase HPLC (RP-LC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and RP-LC-MS were used. The vegetables showed a large batch-to-batch variability, from 0.04 to 3.6, 5.9 and 36 mg total anthraquinone per kg fresh weight in peas, cabbage lettuce, and beans, respectively. Physcion predominated in all vegetables. In the herbs grape vine leaves, couch grass root and plantain herb, anthraquinones were above the limit of detection.

The pesticides were eluted with 2 x 0.5 ml acetone and 3 x 2.5 ml ethyl acetate/acetone (80:20). The eluates were then dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated to 1 ml under a nitrogen current. After adding triphenylphosphate internal standard (i.s.), this extract was analysed by capillary gas chromatography using a nitrogen-phosphorus detector (GC-NPD). Pesticide recovery percentages at levels of 0.01 and 0.02 microgram/ml were between 74% and 111%, with a 2-13% relative standard deviation interval. The chromatograms of extracts had few co-extracted species peaks, with no analytical interference. Dilution of the grape wine samples removed most of the pigments, thus producing clear extracts.

Resveratrol (3, 5, 4'-trihydroxystilbene) was also detected in wine and it was thought to be the active principle of red wines that were shown to reduce heart diseases. This paper reviews data, obtained by the Viticulture Institute of the Catholic University at Piacenza and taken from the literature, on some aspects of stilbene physiology in grapevine and on their relation to resveratrol wine levels. Constitutive stilbene contents of woody organs are reported, as well as the possible role of cluster stems as a source of resveratrol for wine.

9232867,"The protein composition of the grape (Vitis vinifera cv Muscat of Alexandria) berry was examined from flowering to ripeness by gel electrophoresis. A protein with an apparent molecular mass of 24 kD, which was one of the most abundant proteins in extracts of mature berries, was purified and identified by amino acid sequence to be a thaumatin-like protein. Combined cDNA sequence analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry revealed that this protein, VVTL1 (for V. vinifera thaumatin-like protein 1), is synthesized with a transient signal peptide as seen for apoplastic preproteins. Apart from the removal of the targeting signal and the formation of eight disulfide bonds, VVTL1 undergoes no other posttranslational modification. Southern, northern, and western analyses revealed that VVTL1 is found in the berry only and is encoded by a single gene that is expressed in conjunction with the onset of sugar accumulation and softening. The exact role of VVTL1 is unknown, but the timing of its accumulation correlates with the inability of the fungal pathogen powdery mildew (Uncinula necator) to initiate new infections of the berry.

Each food was evaluated intra-orally in eight volunteers. Oral fluid samples were obtained from each volunteer at 30 min intervals at five different tooth sites using absorbent paper points. The oral fluid samples were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively for carbohydrates and organic acids using high performance liquid chromatography. Data obtained for each food were averaged and subjected to statistical analysis. The quantity of lactic acid produced 30 min after ingestion was found to be in the following order: (highest) raisin > chocolate bar > sugar cube > jelly bean > oreo cookie > potato chip (least). Two hours after food intake the order had changed significantly: potato chip > jelly bean > sugar cube > chocolate bar > oreo cookie > raisin. A direct linear relationship existed between lactic acid production and the presence of glucose. In foods containing cooked starch prolonged clearance occurs via the intermediate metabolites maltotriose, maltose and glucose. Results indicated that the term 'stickiness', when used to label certain foods such as jelly bean and chocolate bar, should be used cautiously.

Among 837 samples of 30 agricultural commodities tested, 43% contained residues above the detection limit for the method: 100% of broccoli samples; 80% of cabbage, kiwifruit, and grape samples; and 71% of cucumber samples. Most of the residues in kiwifruit were on or near the skin. Elimination of false-positive detections by the improved method was confirmed with kiwifruit in 2 independent procedures. Whole fruits were washed with 5% EDTA to remove surface residues of EBDC. Analysis of washes for CS2 by the headspace procedure after treatment with acidic stannous chloride and for ethylene thiourea by LC after prolonged treatment at 60 degrees C qualitatively identified the EDTA-soluble residues as EBDC. Although the improved method does not produce false-positive results, peak area responses of CS2 and the internal standard, thiophene, are influenced by chemical composition of the matrix.

For dessert wines (Malaga, Marsala) a median of 337 pg/ml (5; 44-451 pg/ml) resulted. Concentrations of OC were about 10% of those of OA. OA has been detected in red grape-juices for the first time with median concentrations amounting to 235 pg/ml (8; < 3-311 pg/ml). White grape-juices (3) as well as other fruit juices (2 apple, 6 orange, 2 others) did not contain OA (< 5 pg/ml). The analytical method used was not appropriate for grapefruit-juices because of an interfering substance. The results indicate that OA is formed prior to the alcoholic fermentation. It also appears that the more southerly in Europe is the origin of the samples the higher is the frequency of occurrence and the concentration of OA in red wines and red grape-juices. Although the estimated mean daily OA intake of 0-7 ng/kg body mass (men) can easily be more than doubled by moderate wine consumption, an additional health risk by OA is not to be expected.

8664586,"We present a multiresidue method for determination of synthetic pyrethroids in fruits, vegetables, and grains. The method is a modification of AOAC Method 970.52. Residues are extracted with acetonitrile (for fruits and vegetables) or acetonitrile-water (2 + 1) (for grains) and then transferred to hexane. Coextractives are removed by acetonitrile partitioning and open-column chromatography with deactivated Florisil. The final extract is analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). An HP-17 wide-bore column is used to determine the individual isomeric contents of each insecticide. The method was used to recover 8 pyrethroids (biphenthrin, fenpropathrin, cyhalothrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, fluvalinate, fenvalerate, and deltamethrin) spiked at 0.01-4.0 mg/kg in 20 crops (apple, pear, peach, banana, grape, strawberry, potato, tomato, cucumber, pepper, cabbage, carrot, celery, polished rice, wheat, green gram, buckwheat, sorghum, maize, and barley).

8664581,"A novel procedure is described for simple removal of coextractives prior to analysis of fruits and vegetables for azinphos-methyl and azinphos-ethyl residues. The solvent extract is concentrated, placed in a polymeric membrane tube, and then dialyzed in cyclohexane. Both azinphos-methyl and azinphos-ethyl diffuse into the surrounding solvent while coextractants remain inside the membrane. The dialyzing solvent is exchanged during concentration with n-hexane and analyzed without further cleanup by gas-liquid chromatography with a specific thermionic detector. The detection limit for a 25 g grape sample with final volume of extract made to 15 mL was 0.01 mg/kg. Recoveries of both residues from grapes averaged 107% (spike levels of 0.3 to 2.0 mg/kg). From a 20 g spinach sample, recoveries averaged 82% for azinphos-methyl and 72% for azinphos-ethyl when final volume of extract was made to 5 mL (spike levels of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg). Recoveries from 20 types of fruits and vegetables (20 g sample spiked at 1 mg/kg for both azinphos-methyl and azinphos-ethyl) were consistently greater than 70%, except for strawberries (61-67%) and avocado (28-34%). The high lipid content of avocado may impede diffusion of azinphos-methyl and azinphos-ethyl through the polymeric membrane. A field evaluation of the procedure showed a strong correlation (r = 0.957) between azinphos-methyl residues on grapes and treatments with 2 spray formulations.

Comparative values are given from a background area, namely a domestic garden located in the North Yorkshire Dales National Park area. Analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quality control assessment using four international biological reference materials; BCR:CRM 62 Olive Leaves, NIST 1575 Pine Needles, NIST 1573 Tomato Leaves, and NIST 1572 Citrus Leaves. Inter-analytical method comparison is given using two methods of ICP-MS; namely conventional pneumatic nebulisation of sample solution, and direct solids analysis by laser ablation; and neutron activation analysis methods (NAA). For the elements listed there is a good precision obtained by ICP-MS and NAA. In particular levels of < +/- 1-10% (rsd) are obtained. Comparison of data with certified values and other analytical methods are generally of very good agreement. Lead levels in background areas ranged from 0.0008 to 0.340 microgram/g (fresh weight) for plant material; with the lead magnitude greater for grasses > herbs > vegetables > cereals > fruits. Measured values are in good agreement with reported literature values. The lowest Pb values are for marrow, lettuce, tomato and sweet corn samples (approximately 0.001-0.021 microgram/g). 'Green' leaf material levels were approximately 0.02-0.10 microgram/g (i.e. sprouts and cabbage). Root vegetables contain higher levels, approximately 0.02-0.125 microgram/g (especially carrot), reflecting possible metal uptake from soil.

2587126,"To determine the bioavailability of iron from iron-fortified infant foods, we have determined erythrocyte incorporation of the stable isotope, 58Fe, after feeding the following foods extrinsically labeled with 58Fe: 1) rice cereal with apples and bananas (""cereal-fruit product""), 2) Mead Johnson Enriched Baby Food (MJEBF), a vitamin, mineral, and protein-enriched rice cereal, 3) vegetables and beef (""vegetable-beef product""), 4) grape-juice, and 5) MJEBF. Foods 1-4 were fortified with ferrous sulfate, and food 5 was fortified with ferrous fumarate. Blood was obtained at ages 140, 168, and 196 d of age, and the test meal was fed under standardized conditions at 154 d of age. Erythrocyte incorporation of the 58Fe label was determined from the increase in the mass isotope ratio, 58Fe/57Fe, from the baseline value (at 140 d of age) to the follow-up values. The mass isotope ratio was determined by inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Geometric mean total iron incorporation into erythrocytes from the test meal of MJEBF fortified with ferrous sulfate (food 2) was 0.05 mg, and from the vegetable-beef product test meal (food 3) was 0.08 mg. The low value for MJEBF is presumably explained by the low level of iron fortification. The low value for the vegetable-beef product may reflect the presence of inhibitors of iron absorption. Geometric mean erythrocyte incorporations of iron from the test meals with foods 1, 4 and 5 were 0.15, 0.14, and 0.18 mg, respectively. These erythrocyte incorporation values are 20 to 26% of the estimated 0.7 mg requirement for absorbed iron, and therefore seem nutritionally important.",Pediatric research,"['D001682', 'D004912', 'D005527', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007225', 'D007408', 'D007501']","['Biological Availability', 'Erythrocytes', 'Food, Fortified', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Food', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Iron']",Iron absorption from infant foods.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000097']","[None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2587126,1990
3678531,"A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) post-column reactor combination has been developed for the determination of sulphite (free and reversibly bound) in 15 different foods. The foods were treated with a pH 5.1 buffered aqueous 2% formaldehyde solution to convert the labile sulphite to the relatively stable hydroxymethylsulphonate. Reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC with a post-column detector consisting of an initial reaction with KOH followed by colorimetric reaction with Ellman's reagent buffered at pH 6.3 were used for separation and quantitation. The photometric detector at 412 nm quantitated the strongly absorbing 3-carboxy-4-nitrothiophenolate anion, the product of the sulphite reaction with Ellman's reagent. The recovery at levels of 5-100 ppm as sulphur dioxide was greater than 90% by reverse isotope dilution assay.

3120805,"Soluble pectic polysaccharides were isolated from musts of seven mature grape cultivars by a 4-step procedure: pressing of the berries, denaturation of soluble proteins from must by emulsification with chloroform, elimination of diffusable molecules by extensive dialysis and finally discoloration onto Polyamide CC6. The polysaccharides were mainly constituted of arabinose, galactose and galacturonic acid, and their concentration in musts varied from 133 to 593 mg/l. The arabinose/galactose molar ratio was stable (0.91-1.04) for all cultivars, but one, Cinsaut (0.68). Methylation analyses showed that the polysaccharides from musts are a complex mixture of type II arabinogalactans, arabinans and rhamnogalacturonans. Similarities were observed in the relative distributions of galactose and arabinose structural features except for the Cinsaut and Grenache cultivars in which higher proportions of 3- and 3,6-linked galactose were found.",Biochimie,"['D002241', 'D002849', 'D005602', 'D005638', 'D008745', 'D008968', 'D010368', 'D011134']","['Carbohydrates', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'France', 'Fruit', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Pectins', 'Polysaccharides']",A study of pectic polysaccharides in musts from various mature grapes grown in the Pech Rouge experimental vineyards.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3120805,1988
3771451,"Fresh strawberries and grapes grown in Michigan and Indiana were surveyed for residues of captan and folpet, 2 fungicides commonly used on these crops. The fungicides were reportedly applied to the crops by overhead irrigation, tractor sprayer, or aerial spraying, in amounts ranging from 0.5 to 6 lb formulation/acre for captan and from 1 to 4 lb formulation/acre for folpet. Reported dates of last application ranged from just 2 days to nearly 5 months before samples were collected. Twenty-eight strawberry samples and 24 grape samples were collected of crops field-treated with one or both of these fungicides. Samples were analyzed by previously described methodology. Captan residues were found in all strawberry samples, ranging from less than 0.01 to 1.5 ppm. Folpet was found in only one strawberry sample at 0.041 ppm. Captan residues were found in only 6 grape samples, ranging from less than 0.01 to 0.082 ppm. Folpet residues were found in 12 grape samples, ranging from less than 0.01 to 0.50 ppm. All residues were well below the current tolerances of 25 ppm for both captan and folpet in strawberries and 50 ppm for captan and 25 ppm for folpet in grapes. Residue levels of these surface-applied, nonsystemic fungicides were inconsistent with amounts and dates of application, most likely because of variations in weather conditions, especially rainfall.

Contaminant yeast species were cultured in grape musts under controlled conditions and extracts of the resultant wines were assayed for mutagen content using four strains of Salmonella in the Ames Salmonella/microsome/faecalase system. The wine extracts exhibited some toxicity to Salmonella but no mutagen content.

16663304,"Endogenous gibberellin (GA)-like substances were examined in suspension cultures of somatic embryos of a hybrid grape (Vitis vinifera x Vitis rupestris) during embryogenesis, and in mature embryos chilled at 4 degrees C, and subsequently incubated at 26 degrees C with and without abscisic acid (ABA). The extract was separated into a nonpolar fraction (would contain GA-precursors); a fraction that would contain free GAs; and a highly H(2)O-soluble fraction (would contain GA glucosyl conjugates and very polar free GAs). Quantitation after SiO(2) partition chromatography was accomplished by microdrop and immersion dwarf rice bioassays. As embryogenesis developed, the free and highly H(2)O-soluble GA-like substances, expressed on a dry weight basis, decreased (however, they increased on a per embryo basis). Chilling at 4 degrees C for 1 week greatly increased activity of free GA-like substances (per g dry weight and per embryo), it then declined over the next three weeks of chilling. Activity (per g dry weight and per embryo) in the H(2)O-soluble fraction declined throughout chilling. Activity in the GA-precursor fraction, however, increased steadily with chilling (per g dry weight and per embryo). Incubation at 26 degrees C after chilling enhanced activity in the free GA and H(2)O-soluble fractions (per g dry weight and per embryo), but activity in the GA-precursor fraction dropped dramatically. Incubation at 26 degrees C with (+/-) ABA after chilling prevented germination and maintained high activity for GA precursors and less polar free GAs and low activity in the polar free GA and H(2)O-soluble fractions.Kaurene and kaurenoic acid were characterized in the GA-precursor fraction of chilled embryos by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC-MS).

Methyl betaine has been used as internal standard to improve the method. The natural wine contains low quantity of betaine.

It was established that the extraction method with ether and pentane accepted in the literature is suitable for the concentration of the side products of alcoholic beverages and thus for their gaschromatographic qualitative analisis as well. When examing higher alcohols - and also other side-products - the direct, examination without preliminary preparation must be given preference, because in this case there is also a possibility for quantitative determination. On the basis of his results the author considers an increased quality control of home distilled brandy necessary as well as the determination of alcohols of higher order, because in some cases he has detected a greater quality of fusel oil content than permissable (400 mg/100 ml albolute alcohol).",Morphologiai es igazsagugyi orvosi szemle,"['D000433', 'D000434', 'D000440', 'D002849', 'D000431', 'D005504', 'D006814', 'D007880', 'D000432', 'D014920']","['1-Propanol', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Butanols', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Ethanol', 'Food Analysis', 'Hungary', 'Legislation, Drug', 'Methanol', 'Wine']",[Gas chromatography of alcoholic beverages].,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1256466,1976
