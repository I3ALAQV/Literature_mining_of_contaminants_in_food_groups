35267361,"Consumption of tree nuts and peanuts has considerably increased over the last decades due to their nutritional composition and the content of beneficial compounds. On the other hand, such widespread consumption worldwide has also generated a growing incidence of allergy in the sensitive population. Allergy to nuts and peanuts represents a global relevant problem, especially due to the risk of the ingestion of hidden allergens as a result of cross-contamination between production lines at industrial level occurring during food manufacturing. The present review provides insights on peanuts, almonds, and four nut allergens-namely hazelnuts, walnuts, cashew, and pistachios-that are likely to cross-contaminate different food commodities. The paper aims at covering both the biochemical aspect linked to the identified allergenic proteins for each allergen category and the different methodological approaches developed for allergens detection and identification. Attention has been also paid to mass spectrometry methods and to current efforts of the scientific community to identify a harmonized approach for allergens quantification through the detection of allergen markers.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Tree Nuts and Peanuts as a Source of Beneficial Compounds and a Threat for Allergic Consumers: Overview on Methods for Their Detection in Complex Food Products.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35267361,2022
35231713,"Extensive cross-allergic reactivity exists among food-borne plants. As most allergens are glycoproteins, protein sensitization has been extensively studied. However, little attention has been given to the glycan component of glycoproteins. Here, we qualitatively and quantitatively compared the N-glycans of eight cross-reactive plant glycoproteins derived from peach pollen, soy, pine nut, cashew nut, pistachio, walnut, almond, and hazelnut. Cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) were widely present in the allergic glycoproteins according to the following order: pollen > soybean > pistachios > pine nuts > walnuts > cashews > hazelnuts > almonds. The N-glycan structure presented clear differences between the germplasm and vegetative tissue. Importantly, fucosylation and xylosylation levels correlated positively with extensive cross-reactivity between plants, which suggests that CCDs may be one of the causes of cross-allergy. This result provides the foundation for mechanistic studies on plant-derived CCDs as a source of food cross-allergies.",Food chemistry,"['D000485', 'D031021', 'D031211', 'D003429', 'D006023', 'D031324', 'D013058', 'D021184', 'D009754', 'D027927', 'D011134', 'D000068181']","['Allergens', 'Anacardium', 'Corylus', 'Cross Reactions', 'Glycoproteins', 'Juglans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Nut Hypersensitivity', 'Nuts', 'Pistacia', 'Polysaccharides', 'Prunus dulcis']",Comparative mass spectrometry analysis of N-glycans from the glycoproteins of eight allergy-inducing plants.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35231713,2022

However, the spatial distribution of lipids in nuts has not been firmly established. In this study, desorption electrospray ionization combined with ion mobility and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in positive and negative ion modes was applied to visualize spatially the lipids in eight edible nuts, namely almonds, hazelnuts, cashews, walnuts, peanuts, peach seeds, bitter almonds, and Chinese dwarf cherry seeds. The glycerophospholipids were first imaged in nuts in the negative ion mode, while the glycerolipids and phosphatidylcholines were mainly detected in the positive ion mode. In total 87 characterized components, including 47 glycerophospholipids, 24 glycerolipids, eight alkyl phenolic acids, three fatty acid acyl metabolites, four oligosaccharides, and amygdalin, were visualized in the eight nuts, and the collision cross-sectional values of these components were obtained. The outer shell of the nut cotyledon concentrated more abundant components than the center, while for the hydrolyzed glycerophospholipids, the reverse was observed. The results provide a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the location of the diverse metabolite profiles in nuts and of their relationship to their respective health benefits.",Food chemistry,"['D003430', 'D031324', 'D000081362', 'D009754', 'D021241']","['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Juglans', 'Lipidomics', 'Nuts', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Spatial lipidomics of eight edible nuts by desorption electrospray ionization with ion mobility mass spectrometry imaging.,"[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34808757,2021
34778966,"Cashew apple, the hypertrophied peduncle of cashew nut, is a functional food with a high antioxidant activity and with good characteristics for juice industrialization and fresh consumption such as fleshy pulp, soft peel, without seeds, and exotic flavor. However, it is still poorly used or totally wasted. For this reason, the quality of cashew apples has received more attention from the Brazilian breeding program to maximize their uses. In this study, the volatile compound profiles of peduncles of seven cashew clones and their relation to the aroma and flavor differences were investigated. Nine trained panelists evaluated the cashew apples by descriptive analysis. After the standardization of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) extraction and chromatographic conditions, the volatile organic compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 48 compounds were identified with esters being the major chemical class, both in number of compounds and chromatographic peak area. The targeted and untargeted principal component analysis (PCA) analyses showed complementary and corroborative results from the cashew apple volatile composition based on genotype. The partial least squares (PLS) modeling revealed the high correlation of the unpleasant sensory attributes with the PRO805 and CAPI17 clones; sweet taste and sweet odor with the CCP76 clone; and cashew aroma/cashew flavor with the EMBRAPA51, HAC276, PRO555, and SLC12.20 clones. The correlation between the most relevant volatile organic compounds (VOC) for cashew apples and the sensory descriptors showed that the compounds methyl butanoate, methyl 3-methylbutanoate, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, methyl 2-butenoate, methyl 3-methylpentanoate, 3-carene, methyl (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoate, ethyl 4-methylpentanoate, 2-hexenal, butyl 3-methylbutanoate, butyl pentanoate, and 3-methyl butanoic acid were important to explain differences in the characteristic fruit aroma and flavor of cashew apples among the studied clones. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Cashew crops have been developed by using improved clones with increased nut productivity and resistance to diseases. The Brazilian genetic improvement program is also seeking to improve the quality of peduncles to maximize their use and prevent their destination as agricultural waste. In this study, the volatile profile of peduncles of seven cashew clones was determined and its correlation with the differences in their aroma and flavor attributes established. The results will provide important information about the potential of the new materials for fresh consumption and for the manufacturing of cashew juices, in addition to be used by breeders interested in improving the aroma of the fruit.",Journal of food science,"['D031021', 'D000090022', 'D002999', 'D000069600', 'D055549']","['Anacardium', 'Chemometrics', 'Clone Cells', 'Plant Breeding', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Chemometric analysis of the volatile profile in peduncles of cashew clones and its correlation with sensory attributes.,"[None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34778966,2021
34684607,"Nuts are characterized by high nutritional value and are recommended as a part of a healthy diet. At the same time, toxic elements could also be found in them. In this research, we measured the content of As, Cd, Pb and Hg in a wide variety of edible nuts. To determine the As content, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was applied. Cd and Pb were detected by the electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry analytical technique (ETAAS) with Zeeman background correction, while atomic absorption spectrometry method (AAS) with the amalgamation technique in the case of Hg was used. The study material consisted of 120 samples without replications (10 for each subgroup) including the following nuts: Almonds, Brazil nuts, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, pecan nuts, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts. Indicators such as the target hazard quotient (THQ), cancer risk (CR) and hazard index (HI) were used to assess the health risk. The highest median As, Cd, Pb and Hg contents were observed for pistachios (192.42 µg/kg), pine nuts (238.40 µg/kg), peanuts (82.06 µg/kg) and pecans (82.06 µg/kg), respectively. The exceedance of the established limits was found in the case of Pb for nine samples: macadamia nuts (221.49 µg/kg; 2350.94 µg/kg; 2581.43 µg/kg), pine nuts (266.33 µg/kg), peanuts (1353.80 µg/kg) and pecans (2689.13 µg/kg, 2758.26 µg/kg, 2992.29 µg/kg and 3169.41 µg/kg). Extremely high (>2500 µg/kg) Pb content was found in 33% of studied pecans imported from the USA. The health risk indicators did not identify increased health risk. This research is significant considering the food safety issues and indicates the need to regularly control the content of toxic elements in food, as well as to establish the specific limits for heavy metals content in nuts. The chemometric analysis included cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Cluster analysis made it possible to distinguish four subgroups on the basis of the ability to accumulate toxic elements: pine nuts, pecans, pistachios and other analysed nuts. PCA indicated primarily factor 1, distinguishing mainly pecans, macadamia nuts and peanuts. Chemometric analysis can be a useful tool in estimating the ability of different nut species to accumulate contaminants.",Nutrients,"['D005247', 'D006801', 'D009754', 'D018570', 'D018709', 'D018675']","['Feeding Behavior', 'Humans', 'Nuts', 'Risk Assessment', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Toxicity Tests']",Assessment of the Safe Consumption of Nuts in Terms of the Content of Toxic Elements with Chemometric Analysis.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34684607,2021
32442779,"Many individuals with peanut (PN) allergy have severe reactions to tree nuts (TN) such as walnuts or cashews. Although allergenic proteins in TN and PN have overall low identity, they share discrete sequences similar in physicochemical properties (PCP) to known IgE epitopes. Here, PCP-consensus peptides (cp, 13 aa and 31 aa) were identified from an alignment of epitope rich regions of walnut vicilin, Jug r 2, leader sequence (J2LS) and cross-reactive epitopes in the 2S albumins of peanut and synthesized. A peptide similarity search in the Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP) revealed a network of peptides similar (low property distance, PD) to the 13 aa cp (13cp) in many different plant allergens. Peptides similar to the 13cp in PN and TN allergens bound IgE from sera of patients allergic to PN and TN in peptide microarray analysis. The 13cp was used to produce a rabbit consensus peptide antibody (cpAB) that detected proteins containing repeats similar to the 13cp in western blots of various nut extracts, in which reactive proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The cpAB bound more specifically to allergens and nut extracts containing multiple repeats similar to the 13 cp, such as almond (Pru du 6), peanut (Ara h 2) and walnut (Jug r 2). IgE binding to various nut extracts is inhibited by recombinant J2LS sequence and synthetic 31cp. Thus, several repeated sequences similar to the 13cp are bound by IgE. Multiple similar repeats in several allergens could account for reaction severity and clinically relevant cross-reactivity to PN and TN. These findings may help improve detection, diagnostic, and therapeutic tools.",Molecular immunology,[],[],Epitopes with similar physicochemical properties contribute to cross reactivity between peanut and tree nuts.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442779,2020
32290123,"Pistachio and cashew contain allergenic proteins, which causes them to be removed from the diet of allergic people. Previous studies have demonstrated that food processing (thermal and non-thermal) can produce structural and/or conformational changes in proteins by altering their allergenic capacity. In this study, the influence of instant controlled pressure drop (DIC) on pistachio and cashew allergenic capacity has been studied. Western blot was carried out using IgG anti-11S and anti-2S and IgE antibodies from sera of patients sensitized to pistachio and cashew. DIC processing causes changes in the electrophoretic pattern, reducing the number and intensity of protein bands, as the pressure and temperature treatment increment, which results in a remarkable decrease in detection of potentially allergenic proteins. The harshest conditions of DIC (7 bar, 120 s) markedly reduce the immunodetection of allergenic proteins, not only by using IgG (anti 11S and anti 2S) but also when IgE sera from sensitized patients were used for Western blots. Such immunodetection is more affected in pistachio than in cashew nuts, but is not completely removed. Therefore, cashew proteins are possibly more resistant than pistachio proteins. According these findings, instant controlled pressure drop (DIC) can be considered a suitable technique in order to obtain hypoallergenic tree nut flour to be used in the food industry.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000485', 'D031021', 'D052179', 'D002853', 'D005260', 'D005511', 'D006801', 'D007073', 'D008297', 'D021184', 'D009754', 'D027927', 'D010940', 'D053719']","['Allergens', 'Anacardium', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Female', 'Food Handling', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Male', 'Nut Hypersensitivity', 'Nuts', 'Pistacia', 'Plant Proteins', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Influence of Instant Controlled Pressure Drop (DIC) on Allergenic Potential of Tree Nuts.,"['Q000737', 'Q000009', 'Q000276', None, None, None, None, 'Q000276', None, 'Q000175', 'Q000009', 'Q000009', 'Q000009', None]","['chemistry', 'adverse effects', 'immunology', None, None, None, None, 'immunology', None, 'diagnosis', 'adverse effects', 'adverse effects', 'adverse effects', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32290123,2021

This will be in addition to associating the variability of the respective cashew apple pulps with the genotypes by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The NIR analysis is a non-destructive, low-cost procedure that provides prompt results, while considering the morphology of different cashew apples (shape, size, and color). The UPLC-HRMS analysis is characterized by specific bioactive compounds, such as the derivatives of hydroxybutanoic acid, galloyl, and flavonoids. Furthermore, both techniques allowed the identification of a group of accessions, which presented similarities among the chemical profiling. However, to improve the understanding of cashew chemical and physical variability, further variables related to the cashew apple composition, such as edaphoclimatic conditions, should be considered for future studies.

Lipid, which is the most abundant nutrient in nuts, could be one of the major contributors to many beneficial effects. In previous studies, only the composition of fatty acids was investigated. To better understand the nutritional value of nuts, phospholipids (PLs), with widely confirmed bioactivities, should be profiled as well. In this work, a HILIC-ESI-IT-TOF-MS system is applied to characterize PL profiles in six kinds of nut, including almonds, cashews, pecans, pistachios, walnuts and peanuts. A total of 165 PL molecular species were characterized and quantified. The obtained results showed that pistachios, cashews and walnuts are favorable nuts with diverse and high content of PLs; peanuts consist of abundant PL species but lower concentration of PLs; almonds and pecans might not be the first choice for PLs with relatively low species abundance and content.",Food chemistry,"['D031021', 'D031325', 'D002851', 'D031324', 'D009754', 'D027927', 'D021241']","['Anacardium', 'Carya', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Juglans', 'Nuts', 'Pistacia', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Characterization of phospholipid profiles in six kinds of nut using HILIC-ESI-IT-TOF-MS system.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28946239,2017

The effect of the fermentation processing on the volatile profile of probiotic juices was assessed by HS-SPME/GC-MS coupled to chemometrics with 67.9% and 81.0% of the variance in the first principal component for melon and cashew juices, respectively. The Lactobacillus casei fermentation imparted a reduction of ethyl butanoate, ethyl-2-methylbutirate, and ethyl hexanoate for melon juice; and of ethyl acetate, ethyl-2-methyl butanoate, ethyl crotonate, ethyl isovalerate, benzaldehyde, and ethyl hexanoate for cashew juice. Measurements of the stability of these compounds and the formation of the component 3-methyl-2-butenyl in melon juice may be used as a volatile marker to follow the juice fermentation.

25814275,"To help safeguard the food supply and detect the presence of undeclared food allergens and gluten, most producers and regulatory agencies rely on commercial test kits. Most of these are ELISAs with a few being PCR-based. These methods are very sensitive and analyte specific, requiring different assays to detect each of the different food allergens. Mass spectrometry offers an alternative approach whereby multiple allergens may be detected simultaneously. However, mass spectrometry requires expensive equipment, highly trained analysts, and several years before a quantitative approach can be achieved. Using multianalyte profiling (xMAP®) technology, a commercial multiplex test kit based on the use of established antibodies was developed for the simultaneous detection of up to 14 different food allergens plus gluten. The assay simultaneously detects crustacean seafood, egg, gluten, milk, peanut, soy, and nine tree nuts (almond, Brazil nut, cashew, coconut, hazelnut, macadamia, pine nut, pistachio, and walnut). By simultaneously performing multiple tests (typically two) for each analyte, this magnetic bead-based assay offers built-in confirmatory analyses without the need for additional resources. Twenty-five of the assays were performed on buffer extracted samples, while five were conducted on samples extracted using reduced-denatured conditions. Thus, complete analysis for all 14 allergens and gluten requires only two wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. This makes it possible to include in a single analytical run up to 48 samples. All 30 bead sets in this multiplex assay detected 5 ng/mL of food allergen and gluten with responses greater than background. In addition, 26 of the bead sets displayed signal/noise ratios of five or greater.

Almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, and pistachios were high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA; > 55 %). MUFA- and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich nuts were peanuts and pecans, whereas Brazil nuts, pine nuts, and walnuts had the highest PUFA content (> 50 %); the high unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio ranged from 4.5 to 11.8.

Most published papers focus on only one nut type, or those that report a cultivar lack a quality control program, thus making data comparisons difficult. The present study was designed to quantify the healthful lipid constituents of 10 different types of commercially important tree nuts (i.e., almonds, black walnuts, Brazil nuts, cashews, English walnuts, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pine nuts, and pistachios) according to standardized, validated methods. The total lipid content of each nut type ranged from 44.4 ± 1.9% for cashews to 77.1 ± 1.7% for macadamias. As expected, the major fatty acids present in the tree nuts were unsaturated: oleic (18:1 ω9) and linoleic (18:2 ω6) acids. A majority of the lipid extracts contained <10% saturated fatty acids with the exceptions of Brazil nuts (24.5%), cashews (20.9%), macadamias (17.1%), and pistachios (13.3%). The total tocopherol (T) content ranged from 1.60 ± 1.27 mg/100 g nutmeat in macadamias to 32.99 ± 0.78 in black walnuts. The predominant T isomers in the nut types were α- and γ-T. Tocotrienols were also detected, but only in 6 of the 10 nut types (i.e., Brazil nut, cashews, English walnuts, macadamias, pine nuts, and pistachios). In most cases, total phytosterol contents were greater in the present study than reported in peer-reviewed journal papers and the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, which is attributed to total lipid extraction and the inclusion of steryl glucosides in the analysis; the levels were highest for pistachios (301.8 ± 15.4 mg/100 g nutmeat) and pine nuts (271.7 ± 9.1 mg/100 g nutmeat).

16095792,"In this study the content of anacardic acids, cardanols and cardols in cashew apple, nut (raw and roasted) and cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) were analysed. The higher amounts (353.6 g/kg) of the major alkyl phenols, anacardic acids were detected in CNSL followed by cashew fibre 6.1 g/kg) while the lowest (0.65 g/kg) amounts were detected in roasted cashew nut. Cashew apple and fibre contained anacardic acids exclusively, whereas CNSL also contained an abundance of cardanols and cardols. Cashew nut (raw and roasted) also contained low amounts of hydroxy alkyl phenols. Cashew nut shell liquid was used for a basic fractionation of the alkyl phenol classes and the individual anacardic acids, major cardanols and cardols were purified to homogeneity from these fractions by semi-preparative HPLC and definitively identified by nano-ESI-MS-MS, GC-MS and NMR analyses. The hexane extracts (10 mg/ml) of all cashew products tested plus CNSL, displayed significant antioxidant capacity. Cashew nut shell liquid was the more efficient (inhibition=100%) followed by the hexane extract of cashew fibre (94%) and apple (53%). The antioxidant capacity correlated significantly (P<0.05) with the concentration of alkyl phenols in the extracts. A mixture of anacardic acids (10.0 mg/ml) showed the higher antioxidant capacity (IC50=0.60 mM) compared to cardols and cardanols (IC50>4.0 mM). The data shows that of these substances, anacardic-1 was by far the more potent antioxidant (IC50=0.27 mM) compared to cardol-1 (IC50=1.71 mM) and cardanol-1 (IC50>4.0 mM). The antioxidant capacity of anacardic acid-1 is more related to inhibition of superoxide generation (IC50=0.04 mM) and xanthine oxidase (IC50=0.30 mM) than to scavenging of hydroxyl radicals. At present a substantial amount of cashew fibre is mostly used in formulations of animal or poultry feeds. The data presented in this study, indicates that this waste product along with CNSL, both of which contain high contents of anacardic acids, could be better utilized in functional food formulations and may represent a cheap source of cancer chemopreventive agents.",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"['D048729', 'D031021', 'D000975', 'D002851', 'D003849', 'D004791', 'D008401', 'D007202', 'D009682', 'D010636', 'D012118', 'D021241', 'D013481', 'D014969']","['Anacardic Acids', 'Anacardium', 'Antioxidants', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Deoxyguanosine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Phenols', 'Resorcinols', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Superoxides', 'Xanthine Oxidase']",Characterization of alkyl phenols in cashew (Anacardium occidentale) products and assay of their antioxidant capacity.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000037']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'antagonists & inhibitors']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095792,2006
15030196,"In this work the quantitative determination and analytical speciation of arsenic were undertaken in different types of nuts, randomly purchased from local markets. The hardness of the whole nuts and high lipid content made the preparation of this material difficult for analysis. The lack of sample homogeneity caused irreproducible results. To improve the precision of analysis, arsenic was determined separately in nut oil and in the defatted sample. The lipids were extracted from the ground sample with the two portions of a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1). The defatted material was dried and ground again, yielding a fine powder. The nut oil was obtained by combining the two organic extracts and by evaporating the solvents. The two nut fractions were microwave digested, and total arsenic was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results obtained for oils from different types of nuts showed element concentration in the range 2.9-16.9 ng g(-)(1). Lower levels of arsenic were found in defatted material (<0.1 ng g(-)(1) with the exception of Brazil nuts purchased with and without shells, 3.0 and 2.8 ng g(-)(1) respectively). For speciation analysis of arsenic in nut oils, elemental species were extracted from 2 g of oil with 12 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 8 mL of deionized water. The aqueous layer, containing polar arsenic species, was evaporated and the residue dissolved and analyzed by ion chromatography-ICP-MS. The anion exchange chromatography enabled separation of As(III), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAs(V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAs(V)), and As(V) within 8 min. Several types of nuts were analyzed, including walnuts, Brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, pine nuts, peanuts, pistachio nuts, and sunflower seeds. The recovery for the speciation procedure was in the range 72.7-90.6%. The primary species found in the oil extracts were As(III) and As(V). The arsenic concentration levels in these two species were 0.7-12.7 and 0.5-4.3 ng g(-)(1), respectively. The contribution of As in DMAs(V) ranged from 0.1 +/- 0.1 ng g(-)(1) in walnuts to 1.3 +/- 0.3 ng g(-)(1) in pine nuts. MMAs(V) was not detected in almonds, peanuts, pine nuts, sunflower seeds, or walnuts, and the highest concentration was found in pistachio nuts (0.5 +/- 0.2 ng g(-)(1)).",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001151', 'D002851', 'D013058', 'D009754', 'D010936', 'D010938', 'D012680']","['Arsenic', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Nuts', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Oils', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",Speciation of arsenic in different types of nuts by ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","['analysis', 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15030196,2004

12172680,"In addition to determination of total selenium in nuts, the element distribution among different fractions (lipid extract, low molecular weight, and protein fractions), and speciation analysis were studied. Improved precision for total selenium determination was observed after elimination of lipids. Because selenium was not detected in any of the lipid extracts obtained from the different types of nuts (ICP-MS), in each determination and/or speciation procedure used in this work lipids were extracted (chloroform-methanol, 2:1) and discarded before analysis. In agreement with previously reported data, high selenium levels were found in Brazil nuts (those purchased without shells contained approximately a quarter the content than those purchased with shells) and significantly lower levels in walnuts, cashews, and pecans nuts. Low-molecular-weight compounds were extracted with perchloric acid (0.4 mol L(-1)) to furnish a fraction containing 3 to 15% of the total selenium in different types of nuts. The proteins were isolated from nut samples by dissolution in 0.1 mol L(-1) sodium hydroxide and subsequent precipitation with acetone. They were then dissolved in phosphate buffer pH 7.5. Analysis of protein fractions focused on selenium in two possible states - weakly and firmly bound to proteins. Results obtained for Brazil nuts by size-exclusion chromatography with on-line ICP-MS detection, in the absence and in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol, showed that approximately 12% of total selenium was weakly bound to proteins. To obtain information about firmly bound selenium, the protein extracts were hydrolyzed enzymatically with proteinase K. Speciation was performed by means of ion-pairing HPLC-ICP-MS. The primary species found in all types of nuts was Se-methionine (19-25% of total selenium for different types of nuts).",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002851', 'D013058', 'D009754', 'D012643', 'D014131']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Nuts', 'Selenium', 'Trace Elements']",HPLC-ICP-MS determination of selenium distribution and speciation in different types of nut.,"['Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12172680,2002

9285912,"Native cashew (Semecarpus australiensis) is a well-known food source for aboriginal people of northeastern Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is also well known that contact with the seeds at a certain stage of growth can cause sever dermatitis in susceptible individuals. To prepare the fruits for eating, they are commonly treated by leaching for 2-7 days with water followed by heating in bark, and this treatment apparently produces an edible cashew nut. Recently, attempts have been made to use this valuable source of food by a commercial company. It was necessary to identify the active principle(s) in the seeds to determine the most effective way of rendering the seed suitable for human consumption without altering the flavour. By using solvent extraction and silica-gel chromatography, a fraction containing one major urushiol was obtained. Its structure was confirmed by comparison of its NMR and mass spectral (MS) data with that previously reported. This compound, which is found in high yield, is also found in poison ivy (Toxiodenron radicans) and is responsible for dermatitis in susceptible individuals.
