35327266,"Kefalograviera is a well-known hard Greek cheese. The aim of this study was to determine how milk produced from ewes fed omega-3-enriched diets could influence the microbiota as well as the chemical composition of Kefalograviera cheese. At the start of the trial, 30 dairy ewes (Lesvos and Chios crossbreed) were selected and fed a conventional diet, based on alfalfa hay, straw and concentrate feed that contained soybean meal for a period of thirty days. Then, for a period of sixty days the same ewes were fed an omega-3-enriched concentrate feed with a lower level of soybean meal that contained 10% flaxseed and 10% lupins. Milk yield was collected individually on Days 30, 60 and 90 and used to produce three different batches of Kefalograviera cheeses, at the same cheese factory, by using a traditional recipe and identical preparation conditions (pasteurization of milk, salt, rennet and culture). Sample analysis was done after six months of Kefalograviera cheese ripening. MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry) identification was performed by contrasting the samples' mass spectra with the corresponding reference database.

35163533,"The need to feed 9.9 billion people by 2050 will require the coordination of farming practices and water utilization by nutrient-dense plants and crops. High levels of lead (Pb), a toxic element that can accumulate in plants, can lead to toxicity in humans. With the development of novel treatment technologies, such as atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) and engineered nanoparticles (NPs), the time to germination and levels of heavy metals in food and feed commodities can be reduced. This study provides insight into the impact of plasma-activated water (PAW) on the germination rates and effects of soybean seeds, and the resultant combination effects of zinc oxide uptake in the presence of lead. Soybean seedlings were watered with PAW (treated for 3, 5, and 7 min at 30, 50, and 70 kV), and the germination and growth rate were monitored for 10 days. The germinated seedlings were then grown hydroponically in a nutrient solution, and the biomass of each example was measured. The PAW treatment that resulted in the best growth of soybean seeds was then exposed to Pb and zinc-oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) to investigate heavy metal uptake in the presence of nanoparticles. After acid digestion, the rate of heavy metal uptake by the soybean plants was evaluated using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The PAW seeds grew and germinated more quickly, demonstrating that the plasma therapy had an effect. The rate of heavy metal uptake by the plants was also shown to be 5x lower in the presence of ZnONP.",International journal of molecular sciences,"['D000383', 'D018525', 'D018527', 'D053768', 'D019216', 'D058626', 'D036226', 'D012639', 'D013025', 'D013054', 'D015034']","['Agriculture', 'Germination', 'Hydroponics', 'Metal Nanoparticles', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Plasma Gases', 'Seedlings', 'Seeds', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Zinc Oxide']",Effect of High-Voltage Atmospheric Cold Plasma Treatment on Germination and Heavy Metal Uptake by Soybeans (,"[None, 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000494', 'Q000187', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'drug effects', None, None, 'analysis', 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35163533,2022

This study presents an optical method for determining the adulteration level of EVOO with soybean oil as well as peanut oil using LED-induced fluorescence spectroscopy. Eight LEDs with central wavelengths from ultra-violet (UV) to blue are tested to induce the fluorescence spectra of EVOO, peanut oil, and soybean oil, and the UV LED of 372 nm is selected for further detection. Samples are prepared by mixing olive oil with different volume fractions of peanut or soybean oil, and their fluorescence spectra are collected. Different pre-processing and regression methods are utilized to build the prediction model, and good linearity is obtained between the predicted and actual adulteration concentration. This result, accompanied by the non-destruction and no pre-treatment characteristics, proves that it is feasible to use LED-induced fluorescence spectroscopy as a way to investigate the EVOO adulteration level, and paves the way for building a hand-hold device that can be applied to real market conditions in the future.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","['D010367', 'D005506', 'D000069463', 'D010938', 'D013024', 'D013050']","['Arachis', 'Food Contamination', 'Olive Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Soybean Oil', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']","Quantitative Detection of Extra Virgin Olive Oil Adulteration, as Opposed to Peanut and Soybean Oil, Employing LED-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35161972,2022

Fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) is a novel lipid class that was discovered as an endogenous lipid; FAHFAs have shown anti-diabetic effects in a mammalian system. We analyzed the overall FAHFA composition in nut oils and other common oils: almond (raw, roasted), walnut, peanut, olive, palm, soybean, and rapeseed oils. We developed a method of liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) for a comprehensive target analysis of FAHFAs. The analysis revealed wide variation in the FAHFA profiles (15 compounds and 62 peaks). For 7-11 compounds of FAHFA, a total level of 8-29 pmol/mg oil was detected in nuts oils; for 11 compounds, 4.9 pmol/mg oil was detected in olive oil, and for 4-9 compounds, < 2 pmol/mg oil was detected in palm, soy, and rapeseed oils. The major FAHFAs were FAHFA 36:3, FAHFA 36:2, and FAHFA 36:4 in nut oil, FAHFA 36:2, FAHFA 34:1, and FAHFA 36:1 in olive oil, and FAHFA 32:1, FAHFA 34:0, FAHFA 36:0, and FAHFA 36:1 in all of the common oils. The composition of FAHFAs in nut oils is mainly unsaturated fatty acids, whereas those in olive oil are unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. The composition of FAHFAs in common oils was mainly saturated fats. This is the first report to demonstrate the quality and quantity of the FAHFAs in the nut oils.

Non-soy legumes based tempes have been reported to have a nutritional profile different from that of soybean-based tempe. However, a comprehensive study of the metabolite and sensory profiles of legume tempes has not been conducted. This study investigated the metabolite profile of legumes before and after fermentation using a metabolomic approach and its relation to the sensory profile. Four different legumes, namely red kidney bean, soybean, cowpea bean, and jack bean, and four kinds of tempe prepared from the abovementioned legumes were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. These tempe samples were fermented in two different production places, Japan and Indonesia. In total, 83 metabolites were annotated from all samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the samples were separated based on their type (legume and tempe) along PC1 with a 36.3% variance, in which sugars and amino acids significantly contributed to the separation. In addition, samples were separated along PC2 with a 17.2% variance based on the different production places. The combination of 75% soybean and 25% red kidney bean (75S:25R) could increase the concentrations of amino acids that were initially low in soybean tempe. The 75S:25R tempe showed no significant differences in taste and texture preference compared to the 100% soybean tempe, based on sensory result.

Real-time PCR results demonstrated that MvitOBP3 gene was abundantly expressed in the antennal tissue of M. vitrata, while low levels were distributed in the head, thorax, abdomen, leg and wing of adult moths. The recombinant OBP3 protein was purified using the prokaryotic expression and affinity chromatography system. Fluorescence competitive binding experiments indicated that that MvitOBP3 protein exhibited greater binding affinities with host-plant flower volatiles including Butanoic acid butyl ester, Limonene, 1H-indol-4-ol and 2-methyl-3-phenylpropanal, highlighting they may have attractant activities for the oviposition of female moths on the legume vegetables. Moreover, protein homology modeling and molecular docking analysis revealed that there are six amino acid sites of MvitOBP3 involved in the binding of the host-plant volatiles.

Soy and rice drinks are the most successful milk substitutes but are low in fiber and protein contents, respectively, whilst being rich in sugars. Generally, an improvement is foreseen; thus, apart from supplement addition, a natural occurring strategy is functionalizing the drinks by beneficial bacteria fermentation. The aim of this work is to develop novel plant-based drinks assessing different mixtures of soy and rice milks fermented with single or multi-strain probiotics (Lactobacillus fermentum, L. plantarum, L. helveticus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and B. longum). The drinks were characterized to study bacterial performances, by means of culture-dependent and -independent techniques, and their volatilome, by means of solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) analysis. Through multivariate analysis, these features were investigated and correlated to define accurate descriptors of the produced functional drinks. The results showed that combined drinks and multi-strain fermentation generated higher-value products. For example, combined drinks in comparison with single ones had a lower amount of toxic 2-acetyl-3,5-dimethylfuran and higher abundances of desirable compounds such as 2-butanone, 3-hydroxy and butanoic acid. Multivariate analysis of volatile metabolites and physiological parameters could offer a novel approach to assess the quality of functional plant-based drinks and result in a decisional tool for industrial applications.",Food & function,"['D001628', 'D005285', 'D005516', 'D006801', 'D041941', 'D012275', 'D019936', 'D013025', 'D055549']","['Beverages', 'Fermentation', 'Food Microbiology', 'Humans', 'Milk Substitutes', 'Oryza', 'Probiotics', 'Soybeans', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Volatilome changes during probiotic fermentation of combined soy and rice drinks.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729245,2021

In this study, to demonstrate the applicability of liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) for quantitative and confirmatory analysis of pesticide residues in cereal grains and legumes, the LC-QTOF-MS method using full-scan acquisition was validated for 151 pesticides in brown rice, soybeans, and peanuts at a spiked level of 0.01 mg/kg. With the exception of 5 out of 151 target pesticides, sufficiently high signal intensities were obtained at 0.005 μg/mL (corresponding to 0.01 mg/kg). Trueness was in the range 70-95%, with intra- and inter-day precisions below 16% and 24%, respectively, with the exception of 7 pesticides in brown rice, 10 pesticides in soybeans, and 9 pesticides in peanuts. No interfering peaks were observed near the retention times of the target pesticides.

We hypothesized that the odd- and branched-chain fatty acid (OBCFA) profile in intramuscular fat (IMF) might suffice to distinguish lamb meat entering the food chain supply on the basis of the type of diet fed to lambs during the fattening period. A total of 30 individual OBCFA profiles, quantified by gas chromatography, of IMF of Manchego lambs were used. During the fattening period (42 days), the lambs were fed three diets differing in concentrate composition: (i) Control, concentrate typical of commercial fattening rations, rich in starch and based on cereals and soybean meal; (ii) Camelina, similar to Control but replacing 50% of the soybean meal with camelina meal; and (iii) Fibrous, concentrate rich in neutral detergent fiber (NDF), based on fibrous by-products and not including cereals nor soybean meal. The OBCFA were grouped into three classes (linear odd, iso and anteiso fatty acids) and were then submitted to a linear discriminant analysis, using the feeding treatments as grouping variable and the OBCFA class contents in IMF as quantitative variables. The results suggested that a high NDF to starch ratio of the concentrate, being the lowest for Control (CON) treatment and the highest for Fibrous (FIB) treatment, would be negatively related to the odd/anteiso ratio and positively related to the iso/(anteiso+odd) FA ratio in IMF. Determination of OBCFA profile in lamb meat would be useful to monitor the feeding regime (starch- or NDF-rich) of lambs entering the food chain supply.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",[],[],Odd- and Branched-Chain Fatty Acids in Lamb Meat as Potential Indicators of Fattening Diet Characteristics.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33401573,2021

In analytical food evaluation, oils represent an important field, allowing the exploration of the antioxidant effects of herbs and seeds. However, traditional methodologies have some drawbacks which must be overcome, such as being time-consuming, requiring sample preparation, the use of solvents/reagents, and the generation of toxic waste. The objective of this study is to evaluate the protective effect provided by plant-based substances (directly, or as extracts), including pumpkin seeds, poppy seeds, dehydrated goji berry, and Provençal herbs, against the oxidation of antioxidant-free soybean oil. Synthetic antioxidants tert-butylhydroquinone and butylated hydroxytoluene were also considered. The evaluation was made through thermal degradation of soybean oil at different temperatures, and near-infrared spectroscopy was employed in an n-way mode, coupled with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) to extract nontrivial information. The results for PARAFAC indicated that factor 1 shows oxidation product information, while factor 2 presents results regarding the antioxidant effect. The plant-based extract was more effective in improving the frying stability of soybean oil. It was also possible to observe that while the oxidation product concentration increased, the antioxidant concentration decreased as the temperature increased. The proposed method is shown to be a simple and fast way to obtain information on the protective effects of antioxidant additives in edible oils, and has an encouraging potential for use in other applications.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000975', 'D010084', 'D013024', 'D013055', 'D013223', 'D013696']","['Antioxidants', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Soybean Oil', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Temperature']",N-Way NIR Data Treatment through PARAFAC in the Evaluation of Protective Effect of Antioxidants in Soybean Oil.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977514,2021
32930255,"Aflatoxins (AFs), as the secondary metabolites of the toxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, are well known to be extremely harmful to humans and animals because of their high toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity. Recurring and increasing studies on AF ingestion incidents indicate that AF contamination is a serious food safety issue worldwide. Currently, immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) has become the most conventional sample clean-up method for determining AFs in foodstuffs. However, the IAC method may be limited to some laboratories because it requires the use of expensive disposable cartridges and the IA procedure is time-consuming. Herein, to achieve the cost-effective determination of AFs in edible oils, we developed a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) clean-up method based on humic acids (HAs), which is followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAs could be directly used as a DSPE sorbent after simple treatment without any chemical modification. In the HA-DSPE, AFs could remain on the HA sorbent by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, whereas the oil matrix was retained on HA via only hydrophobic interactions. The oil matrix could be sufficiently washed off by n-hexane, whereas the AFs could still be retained on HA; thus, the selective extraction of AFs and clean-up of oil matrices were achieved. Under the optimal conditions of HA-DSPE, satisfactory recoveries ranging from 81.3% to 106.2% for four AFs (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were achieved in various oil matrices i.e. blended oil, mixed olive oil, tea oil, sunflower seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, rice oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. Minor matrix effects ranging from 89.3% to 112.9% were obtained for the four AFs, which were acceptable. Moreover, the LODs of AFs between 0.063 and 0.102 μg kg-1 completely meet the regulatory levels fixed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union (EU), China, or other countries. The proposed methodology was further validated using a naturally contaminated peanut oil, and the results indicated that the accuracy of the HA-DSPE could match the accuracy of the referenced IAC. In addition, HA-DSPE can be used to directly treat diluted edible oil without liquid-liquid extraction and HA is cheap and can be easily obtained from the market worldwide; these advantages make the proposed methodology simple, low-cost, and accessible for the determination of AFs in edible oils.",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,"['D000348', 'D001230', 'D001231', 'D002681', 'D002853', 'D004042', 'D005504', 'D006812', 'D010938', 'D052616', 'D053719']","['Aflatoxins', 'Aspergillus', 'Aspergillus flavus', 'China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Humic Substances', 'Plant Oils', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Facile dispersive solid-phase extraction based on humic acid for the determination of aflatoxins in various edible oils.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930255,2021

PCs from six beans were purified (purity > 98.2%) by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and subsequently identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-Quadrupole (Q)-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-HRMS). Results showed that the PC content of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and soybean (Glycine max) was 50.0 and 34.0 mg/g, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of other beans (P < 0.05). Gas chromatographic analysis showed that soybean contained high proportion of PUFA (58.78%), and chickpea contained high proportion of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (2.73%). A total of 49 molecular species were identified by UHPLC-Q-HRMS. (18:2-18:2)PC was predominant in soybean, adzuki bean, runner bean, and common bean. (16:0-18:1)PC was the major species of chickpea PC, and many ether PC species and DHA-PC were identified. Discriminatory analysis by principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the molecular profiles of chickpea PC were significantly different from other beans studied. The findings suggest that chickpea appears to be an interesting plant source of DHA and ether lipids for dietary supplement. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, we reported an UHPLC-Q-HRMS technique to identify PC molecular species of six beans. The diversity of PC molecular species in the different beans was classified using chemometrics. This analytical method not only provides comprehensive information to nutritionists about the PC distribution in different beans, but also can identify biomarkers for bean flour fraud identification in food supplementation.

The results showed that the meat of crabs (150 ± 25 g) cultured by five fattening feed were distinguished effectively with the electronic tongue. The total free amino acids and taste nucleotides in the meat of crab cultured by Diet 1 were higher than others. The contents of betaine (taste activity value <1) and umami amino acids in the meat of Diet 3 were highest. The contents of sweet amino acids in the meat of crab cultured by Diet 5 was the highest among the different diet. The equivalent umami concentration of Diet 1 was the highest, suggesting that the umami taste is better. In conclusion, 50% of fish oil could be replaced by vegetable oil in fattening feeds.

The aim of this work was to employ two wastes -soybean husk and flour mill waste- to produce high quantities of alpha-amylase enzyme. The substrate composition and the culture conditions were assayed to improve alpha-amylase production by solid-state fermentation employing the fungus Aspergillus oryzae. The maximum productivity of the enzyme was achieved using a culture substrate composed of the two wastes, at 45% soybean husk and 55% flour mill by-product, without pre-treatment, at an incubation temperature of 30 °C. The optimal incubation time (6 days), yielded a very high alpha-amylase activity (47,000 U/g dry substrate) at low-cost. The enzymatic extract obtained was characterized by LC-MS, providing a complete profile of the proteins produced during the solid-state fermentation on these two wastes. Then, the extract was purified in a single-step by size-exclusion chromatography and the recovery and the purification factor of alpha-amylase enzyme were about 83% and 6, respectively.

Umami fractions of red oncom and black oncom that are responsible for umami taste have not been investigated yet. The objective of this research was to characterize umami fractions obtained by ultrafiltration and chromatography of both oncoms. The first step, water-soluble extracts of oncoms were ultrafiltered using a membrane with cutoff 3,000 Da and followed by gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G-25) to obtain umami fractions. Ultrafiltration fractions of red oncom (molecular weight [MW] less than 3,000 Da) and black oncom (MW more than 3,000 Da) had an intense umami taste. The further fractionation by gel filtration chromatography linked to taste dilution analysis yielded umami fractions. Chemical characterization revealed that free glutamic acid, free phenylalanine, and peptides containing their residual amino acids were present in the fractions.

In this work, we described the results of a comprehensive evaluation of the current literature on MS-based allergen detection aiming at collecting all available information about proteins and peptide markers validated in independent studies for the six allergenic ingredients of interest. The main features of the targeted proteins were commented reviewing all details available about known isoforms and sequence homology particularly in plant-derived allergens.

31940983,"Food plants contain hundreds of bioactive phytochemicals arising from different secondary metabolic pathways. Among these, the metabolic route of the amino acid Tryptophan yields a large number of plant natural products with chemically and pharmacologically diverse properties. We propose the identifier ""indolome"" to collect all metabolites in the Tryptophan pathway. In addition, Tryptophan-rich plant sources can be used as substrates for the fermentation by yeast strains to produce pharmacologically active metabolites, such as Melatonin. To pursue this technological development, we have developed a UHPLC-MS/MS method to monitor 14 Tryptophan, Tryptamine, amino-benzoic, and pyridine metabolites. In addition, different extraction procedures to improve the recovery of Tryptophan and its derivatives from the vegetal matrix were tested. We investigated soybeans, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and spirulina because of their botanical diversity and documented healthy effects. Four different extractions with different solvents and temperatures were tested, and water extraction at room temperature was chosen as the most suitable procedure to extract the whole Tryptophan metabolites pattern (called by us ""indolome"") in terms of ease, high efficiency, short time, low cost, and sustainability. In all plant matrices, Tryptophan was the most abundant indole compound, while the pattern of its metabolites was different in the diverse plants extracts. Overall, 5-OH Tryptamine and Kynurenine were the most abundant compounds, despite being 100-1000-fold lower than Tryptophan. Melatonin was undetected in all extracts, but sesame showed the presence of a Melatonin isomer. The results of this study highlight the variability in the occurrence of indole compounds among diverse food plants.

NMR, ESI mass spectrometry, and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) study enlightens the formation of more stable product CPI-Cys. The ""turn on"" response of the probe CPI occurs due to the interruption of intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) process upon reacting with cysteine. Moreover, CPI is a very stable, cost-effective compound and exhibits excellent real-time selectivity towards Cys over all other comparative biorelevant analytes. Interestingly, our proposed method is much advantageous as it is able to estimate cysteine predominantly by screening out other comparative biocomponents found in different protein-rich foods.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002227', 'D003545', 'D005456', 'D005504', 'D057230', 'D008958', 'D011725', 'D013050']","['Carbazoles', 'Cysteine', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Food Analysis', 'Limit of Detection', 'Models, Molecular', 'Pyridines', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",Development of a new fluorescent probe for cysteine detection in processed food samples.,"['Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","['chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300856,2019
31055712,"Okara is a major agro-waste produced from the soybean industry. To hydrolyze the okara and enable nutrient release, a strategy to valorize okara using solid-state fermentation with food grade Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) WX-17 was carried out. The study showed that fermentation of okara with B. subtilis WX-17 improved its overall nutritional content. The total amino acids content increased from 3.04 ± 0.14 mg/g in unfermented okara to 5.41 ± 1.21 mg/g in okara fermented with B. subtilis WX-17. Total fatty acids content increased from 153.04 ± 5.10 to 166.78 ± 2.41 mg/g okara, after fermentation. Antioxidant content (DPPH) also increased by 6.4 times after fermentation. To gain insight into the mechanism, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was carried out. In total, 49 metabolites were detected, which could be classified mainly into carbohydrates, TCA cycle metabolites, amino acids and fatty acids. The decrease in carbohydrate metabolites, showed that glycolysis was upregulated. This would have provided the energy and metabolic flux towards the amino acid and fatty acid pathway. This is also in line with the increased amino acids and fatty acid production seen in okara fermented with B. subtilis WX-17. The findings of this work demonstrated the potential of using B. subtilis WX-17 fermentation, to enhance the nutritional profile of okara. This could serve as a potential low-cost animal feed or incorporated into the human diet.",AMB Express,[],[],A metabolomic approach to understand the solid-state fermentation of okara using Bacillus subtilis WX-17 for enhanced nutritional profile.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055712,2020
30997934,"Protein isolates were recovered from scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) gonads to develop a novel functional matrix by investigating their physiochemical and functional properties. Scallop gonad protein isolates (SGPIs) were prepared from degreased scallop gonads (DSGs) by an alkali extraction and isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) process. The protein compositions of the SGPIs were mainly vitellogenin and beta-actin with molecular weights of 266 and 42 kDa, respectively, as determined using Nano-liquid chromatography-mass/mass (Nano-LC-MS/MS). After the ISP process, the protein solubility of the SGPIs was significantly improved, and the surface hydrophobicity of SGPIs intensely increased by 1.1-fold, which were attributed to the exposure of aromatic residues such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. However, the content of total/reactive sulfhydryl in SGPIs was decreased compared with that of DSGs. Meanwhile, the ISP process caused partial protein unfolding, as indicated by circular dichroism analysis, which exhibited a remarkable rise in the β-sheet content with a parallel decline in the α-helix and random coil contents (P < 0.05). SGPIs exhibited a better oil absorption capacity and foaming property than both DSGs and soybean protein isolates (SPIs). Moreover, the emulsifying capacity of SGPIs was greatly enhanced by the ISP process, which was superior to the effect of commercial SPIs and was ascribed to its favorable solubility as well as surface characteristics. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: During the processing of scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) adductors, scallop gonad, a high-protein part, is usually discarded as processing by-products despite its edibility. In recent years, scallop gonads are regarded as good sources to develop protein matrices due to their high protein content and numerous nutrients. In this study, scallop gonad protein isolates (SGPIs) were isolated by isoelectric solubilization/precipitation (ISP) process. The preferable solubility, foaming property coupled with high emulsifying property of SGPIs indicated that the SGPIs could be potentially utilized as a good protein emulsifier and additives in production of kamaboko gels, hamburger patties, sausages, and pet foods.",Journal of food science,"['D000818', 'D002853', 'D045703', 'D004655', 'D005503', 'D005524', 'D005782', 'D006066', 'D006801', 'D049897', 'D011506', 'D017747', 'D012995', 'D053719']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Emulsifying Agents', 'Emulsions', 'Food Additives', 'Food Technology', 'Gels', 'Gonads', 'Humans', 'Pectinidae', 'Proteins', 'Seafood', 'Solubility', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Physiochemical Properties and Functional Characteristics of Protein Isolates from the Scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) Gonad.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30997934,2019

30442926,"Phytoestrogens are plant-derived compounds found in a variety of foods, most notably, soy. These compounds have been shown to improve immuno-metabolic health, yet mechanisms remain uncertain. We demonstrated previously that dietary phytoestrogen-rich soy (SOY) rescued metabolic dysfunction/inflammation following ovariectomy (OVX) in female rats; we also noted remarkable shifts in gut microbiota in SOY vs control diet-fed rats. Importantly, specific bacteria that significantly increased in those fed the SOY correlated positively with several favorable host metabolic parameters. One mechanism by which gut microbes might lead to such host effects is through production of bacterial metabolites. To test this possibility, we utilized non-targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) to assess the fecal metabolome in those previously studied animals. Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) revealed clear separation of fecal metabolomes based on diet and ovarian state. In particular, SOY-fed animals had greater fecal concentrations of the beneficial bacterial metabolite, S-equol, which was positively associated with several of the bacteria upregulated in the SOY group. S-equol was inversely correlated with important indicators of metabolic dysfunction and inflammation, suggesting that this metabolite might be a key mediator between SOY and gut microbiome-positive host health outcomes.",Scientific reports,"['D000818', 'D002432', 'D004032', 'D005243', 'D005260', 'D000069196', 'D005786', 'D053858', 'D008660', 'D055442', 'D009206', 'D010052', 'D051381', 'D013025']","['Animals', 'Cecum', 'Diet', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Metabolism', 'Metabolome', 'Myocardium', 'Ovariectomy', 'Rats', 'Soybeans']",Soy-Induced Fecal Metabolome Changes in Ovariectomized and Intact Female Rats: Relationship with Cardiometabolic Health.,"[None, 'Q000382', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'microbiology', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30442926,2019

30052442,"Grass pea, a protein-rich, high-yielding, and drought-tolerant legume, is used as food and livestock feed in several tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The abundant seed proteins of grass pea are salt-soluble globulins, which can be separated into vicilins and legumins. In many other legumes, the members of vicilin seed proteins have been identified as major allergens. However, very little information is available on the allergens of grass pea. In this study, we have identified an abundant 47 kDa protein from grass pea, which was recognized by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies from sera drawn from several peanut-allergic patients. The IgE-binding 47 kDa protein was partially purified by affinity chromatography on a Con-A sepharose column. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the 47 kDa grass pea protein revealed sequence homology to 47 kDa vicilin from pea and Len c 1 from lentil. Interestingly the grass pea vicilin was found to be susceptible to pepsin digestion in vitro. We have also isolated a cDNA encoding the grass pea 47 kDa vicilin (β-lathyrin), and the deduced amino acid sequence revealed extensive homology to several known allergens, including those from peanut and soybean. A homology model structure of the grass pea β-lathyrin, generated using the X-ray crystal structure of the soybean β-conglycinin β subunit as a template, revealed potential IgE-binding epitopes located on the surface of the molecule.

The opioids are generally resistant to hydrolyze by proteases, except the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5) enzyme, because of proline amino acid. β-casomorphin (BCM) from milk casein, gluteomorphin (GM) from wheat gluten, and soymorphin (SM) from the soybean β-conglycinin β-subunit are natural substrates of DPPIV because of their amino acid sequences and proline location. In the present study, DPPIV from Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis was purified and characterized by mass spectrometry. Purified DPPIV was added to standard BCM, GM, and SM, and hydrolysis percentages of morphins were measured by HPLC analysis. The results indicated that DPPIV enzyme hydrolyzed food-derived opioids (from 0.1 mM to 2 mM), BCM (33.42% for 2 mM), SM (83.81% for 2 mM), and GM (45.73% for 2 mM) in vitro.

Because the high price of peony seed oil may tempt unscrupulous merchants to dilute it with cheaper substitutes, a rapid detection method for likely adulterants is required. In this study, the fatty acid composition of peony seed oil and four less expensive edible oils (soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, and rapeseed oil) were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Peony oil adulterated by other edible oils was assessed using iodine values to estimate the extent of adulteration. Adulteration was also measured using an electronic nose (E-nose) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Results indicated that peony seed oil was highly enriched in α-linolenic acid. Although the iodine value can be used to detect some adulterants by measuring unsaturation, it was not able to detect all four potential adulterants. In contrast, the E-nose can rapidly identify adulterated peony seed oil by sampling vapor. Data analyses using PCA and LDA show that LDA more effectively clusters the data, discriminates between pure and adulterated oil, and can detect adulteration at the 10% level.

The offer of novel edible oils from herbs, spices and fruit seeds has grown and many of them are used as functional food and dietary supplements but also as feed additives in animal feeding. Poultry meat is recommended.in properly balanced diet and its consumption in Poland has been growing. The objective of present study was to verify if the supplementation of chickens' diet with grape seed oil or pomegranate seed oil influences cholesterol content and fatty acids (FA) profile in their livers. Ross 308 chickens (n = 24) were fed with fodder enriched with grape seed oil (G group) or pomegranate seed oil (P group). Diet of control group (C group) was based on soybean oil. FA analysis in livers as well as cholesterol content was made with gas chromatography. We observed significant increase in fat content when part of soybean oil was replaced by grape seed oil (p = 0.0002). Its highest amount was detected in G group (4.44 ± 1.53%) whereas the lowest in C group (1.73 ± 0.53%). Applied supplementation did not change total cholesterol content. Its content ranged from 233.0 ± 12.2 mg/100 g in G group to 234.6 ± 29.7 mg1100 g in C group. However, chickens' diet modification with grape seed oil and pomegranate seed oil influenced the FA profile in livers. We detected the presence of punicic acid (cis-9, trans-11, cis-13 C18:3, PA) in livers of chicken fed with pomegranate seed oil. Pomegranate seed oil is one of natural sources of conjugated linolenic acids (CLnA), which predominate in this oil (PA >70% of all FA). However, in livers PA constituted only 0.90 ± 0.10% of all fatty acids. Furthermore, we detected substantial amounts of rumenic acid (cis-9, trans-11 C18:2, RA) - the major isomer of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). Its natural sources in diet are meat and milk of ruminants, but incorporation of pomegranate seed oil into chickens' diet caused a significant increase of its share in fatty acids pool in their livers (3.73 ? 0.79% in P group in relation to 0.08 ± 0.03% in G group and 0.02 ± 0.00% in C group, p < 0.0001).

Potential differences in Se-metabolism were evaluated based on the total Se concentrations along with non-protein Se speciation patterns in the urine and blood serum of the rats. The total Se concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Se compounds in the samples were identified through high-performance liquid chromatography/ICP-MS. The total Se excretion rate was dose-dependent, and excess of dietary Se was eliminated in the form of Se-sugar 1, regardless of the administered Se-form. The excretion dynamics of dietary selenomethionine (soybean meal) and methylselenocysteine (Se-DRS) were different to that of the mineral Se (Se-salt). The proportions of Se species in the urine were significantly influenced by the Se source. A specific metabolic pathway, resulting in urinary excretion of Se-sugar 2, was observed in animals fed Se-DRS.

Adsorption of the analytes onto the primary-secondary amine used in the clean-up step was avoided by using 1% formic acid in acetonitrile as the extraction solvent to maintain the acidic herbicides in a non-ionized state. Trueness studies were carried out at three levels (2.5, 25 and 250 μg/kg for ethoxysulfuron and 5, 50 and 500 μg/kg for the other three analytes). Promising trueness (70.2%-119.8%) was achieved for all herbicides in all matrices after clean-up, with relative standard deviations (RSDr) < 18.6%. Satisfactory matrix effects (-19.7% to 14.8%) were also obtained.

29370131,"Adulteration of edible oils has attracted attention from more researchers and consumers in recent years. Complex multispecies adulteration is a commonly used strategy to mask the traditional adulteration detection methods. Most of the researchers were only concerned about single targeted adulterants, however, it was difficult to identify complex multispecies adulteration or untargeted adulterants. To detect adulteration of edible oil, identification of characteristic markers of adulterants was proposed to be an effective method, which could provide a solution for multispecies adulteration detection. In this study, a simple method of multispecies adulteration detection for camellia oil (adulterated with soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil) was developed by quantifying chemical markers including four isoflavones, trans-resveratrol and sinapic acid, which used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) combined with solid phase extraction (SPE). In commercial camellia oil, only two of them were detected of daidzin with the average content of 0.06 ng/g while other markers were absent. The developed method was highly sensitive as the limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.02 ng/mL to 0.16 ng/mL and the mean recoveries ranged from 79.7% to 113.5%, indicating that this method was reliable to detect potential characteristic markers in edible oils. Six target compounds for pure camellia oils, soybean oils, peanut oils and rapeseed oils had been analyzed to get the results. The validation results indicated that this simple and rapid method was successfully employed to determine multispecies adulteration of camellia oil adulterated with soybean, peanut and rapeseed oils.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D028244', 'D002853', 'D005506', 'D057230', 'D013058', 'D064209', 'D010938', 'D015203', 'D052616']","['Camellia', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Limit of Detection', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Phytochemicals', 'Plant Oils', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Solid Phase Extraction']",Multispecies Adulteration Detection of Camellia Oil by Chemical Markers.,"['Q000737', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None]","['chemistry', 'methods', None, None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29370131,2018

To investigate organochlorine compounds in vegetable oils as possible precursors for 3-MCPD esters, we tested crude palm, soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, corn, coconut, and olive oils for the presence of organochlorine compounds. Having found them in all vegetable oils tested, we focused subsequent study on oil palm products. Analysis of the chlorine isotope mass pattern exhibited in high-resolution mass spectrometry enabled organochlorine compound identification in crude palm oils as constituents of wax esters, fatty acid, diacylglycerols, and sphingolipids, which are produced endogenously in oil palm mesocarp throughout ripening. Analysis of thermal decomposition and changes during refining suggested that these naturally present organochlorine compounds in palm oils and perhaps in other vegetable oils are precursors of 3-MCPD esters.

Specifically, we extracted proteins in raw milk, treated with tryptic digestion, and obtained peptide fingerprints by UPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry with proteomics to differentiate authentic milks from their counterparts adulterated with nonmilk proteins. This approach is able to detect soybean and pea powder-adulterated milks at as low as 1% (wt/wt). Additionally, we obtained the characteristic peptide sequences for milk authentication by principal component analysis.

This study evaluated the water extract of soybean meal, a low-cost compound system, in mediating the laccase catalyzed degradation of a model contaminant of emerging concern, sulfadimethoxine (SDM), and demonstrated it as a promising alternative mediator for soil and water remediation. Removal of 73.3% and 65.6% was achieved in 9 h using soybean meal extract (SBE) as the mediating system for laccase-catalyzed degradation of sulfadimethoxine at the concentration of 1 ppm and 10 ppm, respectively. Further degradation of sulfadimethoxine was observed with multiple SBE additions. Using SBE as mediator increased the 9-h removal of SDM at 1 ppm initial concentration by 52.9%, 49.4%, and 36.3% in comparison to the system mediated by 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), p-Coumaric acid (COU) and 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), respectively.

The putative correlation between immunoreactivity and resistance to the human gastrointestinal (GI) digestion has drawn attention to investigating soybean proteins digestibility. In this work, we provided further insights into this field by performing in vitro simulated GI digestion experiments directly on ground soybean seeds, to provide more realistic results obtained from the digestion of the whole food matrix. Soybean digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by untargeted HPLC-MS/MS analysis and the final data were software treated to enable protein/peptide identification. The latter allowed monitoring the proteolytic degradation of the main soybean proteins during the gastric and duodenal phases. In particular, β-conglycinin and trypsin inhibitors showed the highest resistance to the combined activity of GI enzymes, showing a partial degradation at the end of the duodenal phase as ascertained by the strong electrophoretic bands displayed at 50 kDa and 20 kDa, respectively. Glycinin subunits also presented, even if to a lower extent, resistance to the complete proteolytic degradation, as demonstrated by polypeptide fragments with molecular weight lower than 20 kDa displayed in the gel at the end of duodenal digestion. In addition, by bioinformatics analysis it was demonstrated that the GI resistant fragments of the allergenic proteins, β-conglycinin and glycinin, retained in their primary structure linear epitopes potentially able to trigger an immunoreaction when exposed to the intestinal mucosa. Moreover, such resistant peptides also presented a structural homology with epitope sequences recognized in other legume species, presenting a potential risk of adverse cross-reaction for a larger category of allergic consumers.",Food & function,"['D000595', 'D004386', 'D005753', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D008969', 'D010449', 'D030262', 'D013025', 'D053719']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Duodenum', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Soybean Proteins', 'Soybeans', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Insight into the gastro-duodenal digestion resistance of soybean proteins and potential implications for residual immunogenicity.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28294226,2017

Eco-friendly advantages and promising applications of rhamnolipids in various industries are the major reasons for pursuing the economic production of these biosurfactants. This study shows that cultivation of P. aeruginosa MR01 in medium contained inexpensive soybean oil refinery wastes which exhibited similar levels and homologues of rhamnolipids. Mass spectrometry indicated that the Rha-C10-C10 and Rha-Rha-C10-C10 constitute the main rhamnolipids in different cultures of MR01 including one of oil carbon source analogues. Moreover, rhamnolipid mixtures extracted from different cultures showed critical micelle concentrations (CMC) in the range of ≃24 to ≃36mg/l with capability to reduce the surface tension of aqueous solution from 72 to ≃27-32mN/m. However, the sol-gel technique using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was used as a gentler method in order to entrap the P. aeruginosa MR01 cells in mold silica gels. Immobilized cells can be utilized several times in consecutive fermentation batches as well as in flow fermentation processes. In this way, reusability of the cells may lead to a more economical fermentation process. Approximately 90% of cell viability was retained during the silica sol-gel immobilization and ≃84% of viability of immobilized cells was preserved for 365days of immobilization and storage of the cells in phosphate buffer at 4°C and 25°C.

Despite strong evidence supporting its beneficial use in agriculture, there are concerns that chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, could present a risk to terrestrial ecosystems and human health. Triclosan is one of the most commonly detected compounds in biosolids. To date, laboratory studies indicate that triclosan likely poses a de minimis risk to field crops; however, these studies were either conducted under unrealistic exposure conditions or only assessed 1 or 2 formulations of biosolids. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of triclosan on field crops in soils amended with 4 different formulations of biosolids (liquid, dewatered, compost, and alkaline-hydrolyzed), containing both background and spiked triclosan concentrations, following best management practices used in the province of Ontario. Three crop species (corn, soybean, and spring wheat) were evaluated using several plant growth endpoints (e.g., root wet mass, shoot length, shoot wet/dry mass) in 70-d to 90-d potted soil tests. The results indicated no adverse impact of triclosan on any crop-biosolids combination. Conversely, amending soil with biosolids either enhanced or had no negative effect, on the growth of plants. Results of the present study suggest little risk of triclosan to crops in agricultural fields amended with biosolids.

27988886,"Some naturally occurring cotton accessions contain commercially attractive seed oil fatty acid profiles. The likely causal factor for a high-oleate trait in pima cotton ( Gossypium barbadense ) accession GB-713 is described here. Vegetable oils are broadly used in the manufacture of many human and animal nutritional products, and in various industrial applications. Along with other well-known edible plant oils from soybean, corn, and canola, cottonseed oil is a valuable commodity. Cottonseed oil is a co-product derived from the processing of cottonseed fiber. In the past, it was used extensively in a variety of food applications. However, cottonseed oil has lost market share in recent years due to less than optimal ratios of the constituent fatty acids found in either traditional or partially hydrogenated oil. Increased awareness of the negative health consequences of dietary trans-fats, along with the public wariness associated with genetically modified organisms has created high demand for naturally occurring oil with high monounsaturate/polyunsaturate ratios. Here, we report the discovery of multiple exotic accessions of pima cotton that contain elevated seed oil oleate content. The genome of one such accession was sequenced, and a mutant candidate fatty acid desaturase-2 (FAD2-1D) gene was identified. The mutant protein produced significantly less linoleic acid in infiltrated Arabidopsis leaf assays, compared to a repaired version of the same enzyme. Identification of this gene provides a valuable resource. Development of markers associated with this mutant locus will be very useful in efforts to breed the high-oleate trait into agronomic fiber accessions of upland cotton.",Planta,"['D000483', 'D000595', 'D002849', 'D003369', 'D044943', 'D018506', 'D017343', 'D003368', 'D019787', 'D009154', 'D019301', 'D010802', 'D020871', 'D012333', 'D016415', 'D017422']","['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Cottonseed Oil', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Gossypium', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Mutation', 'Oleic Acid', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",Naturally occurring high oleic acid cottonseed oil: identification and functional analysis of a mutant allele of Gossypium barbadense fatty acid desaturase-2.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000235', None, None, 'Q000201', 'Q000032', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None]","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'genetics', None, None, 'enzymology', 'analysis', 'genetics', 'metabolism', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27988886,2017

This study is the first report an efficient method to prepare isoflavone rich soybean leaves (soyleaves) which is an edible food stuff in Asian countries. The preharvest treatment of ethylene highly stimulated the level of isoflavone in soyleaves. Annotation and quantification of metabolites were determined by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS and HPLC. Phenolic metabolites of soyleaves are mostly kaempferol glycosides, but not dietary isoflavones. The accumulated isoflavones by ethylene treatment were determined to be daidzin 1, genistin 2, malonyldaidzin 3 and malonylgenistin 4, which were easily hydrolyzed to daidzein and genistein by β-glucosidase. Total content of dietary isoflavones was increased up to 13854 μg/g. The most suitable condition was estimated to be 250 μg/g ethylene or 200 μg/g ethephon (ethylene donor) treatment at the R3 growth stage. The ratio of daidzein and genistein glycosides was approximately 5 to 3. The accumulated isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes were identified within the transcriptome of soyleaves tissues at 1 day after treatment of ethephon. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis of these genes indicated significantly higher expression of CHS, CHI, IFS, HID, IF7GT, and IF7MaT compared to control leaves.

27558170,"Soy pulp, called ""okara"" in Japanese, is known as a by-product of the production of bean curd (tofu), and expected to contain a variety of biologically active substances derived from soybean. However, the biological activities of okara ingredients have not yet been fully understood, and the effectiveness of okara as a functional food seems necessary to be further evaluated. Then the effect of okara extract on angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was examined in vitro, and the extract was shown to cause the inhibition of ACE activity in a manner depending on its concentration. Kinetic analysis indicated that this enzyme inhibition was accompanied by an increase in the Km value without any change in Vmax. Further studies suggested that putative inhibitory substances contained in the extract might be heat stable and dialyzable, and recovered mostly in the peptide fraction obtained by a spin-column separation and a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation. Therefore, the extract was speculated to contain small-size peptides responsible for the inhibitory effect of okara extract on ACE activity, and could be expected to improve the hypertensive conditions by reducing the production of hypertensive peptide.",Journal of dietary supplements,"['D000704', 'D000804', 'D000806', 'D000959', 'D005591', 'D002851', 'D006801', 'D006973', 'D010455', 'D010936', 'D030262', 'D013025']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Angiotensin II', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Peptides', 'Plant Extracts', 'Soybean Proteins', 'Soybeans']",Soy Pulp Extract Inhibits Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Activity In Vitro: Evidence for Its Potential Hypertension-Improving Action.,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000188', 'Q000187', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000737']","[None, 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'methods', None, None, 'drug therapy', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27558170,2017

The procedure involved extraction of the rodenticides from samples with acetone, followed by liquid-liquid partitioning with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and 10% sodium chloride aqueous solution, then cleanup using GPC, and finally, analysis using LC-MS/MS. High recoveries from the GPC column were obtained for all rodenticides tested using a mobile phase of acetone/cyclohexane/triethylamine (400:1600:1, v/v/v). An ODS column, which contains low levels of metal impurities, gave satisfactory peak shapes for both hydroxycoumarin- and indandione-type rodenticides in the LC-MS/MS separation. The average recoveries of rodenticides from eight agricultural foods (apple, eggplant, cabbage, orange, potato, tomato, brown rice, and soybean) fortified at 0.0005-0.001 mg/kg ranged from 76 to 116%, except for bromadiolone in orange (53%) and diphacinone in soybean (54%), and the relative standard deviations ranged from 1 to 16%. The proposed method effectively removed interfering components, such as pigments and lipids, and showed high selectivity. In addition, the matrix effects were negligible for most of the rodenticide/food combinations.

A cDNA library was constructed from seven stages of developing soybean seeds to investigate candidate allergens. We searched the library for cDNAs encoding a seed-specific biotinylated protein (SBP) based on its allergenicity in boiled lentils. A full-length cDNA clone was retrieved and expressed as a 75.6-kDa His-tagged recombinant protein (rSBP) in Escherichia coli. Western immunoblotting of boiled bacterial extracts demonstrated specific IgE binding to rSBP, which was further purified by metal affinity and anion exchange chromatographies. Of the 23 allergic sera screened by ELISA, 12 contained IgEs specific to the purified rSBP. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a predominantly unordered structure consistent with SBP's heat stability. The natural homologues (nSBP) were the main proteins isolated from soybean and peanut embryos after streptavidin affinity purification, yet they remained low-abundance proteins in the seed as confirmed by LC-MS/MS. Using capture ELISAs, the soybean and peanut nSBPs were bound by IgEs in 78 and 87% of the allergic sera tested. The soybean nSBP was purified to homogeneity and treatments with different denaturing agents before immunoblotting highlighted the diversity of its IgE epitopes.

26964532,"The quality of chicken meat, which is one of the most widely consumed meats in the world, has been the subject of research and studies for many years. There are several ways to improve the quality of this type of meat, including changing the concentrations of individual molecular components. Such important components of meat are inter alia, cholesterol, vitamin E, and some fatty acids such as ω-3 and ω-6. Manipulation of ingredient levels may be achieved by enriching chicken feed with elements of different types such as vegetable oils, garlic, or selenium. Thus far, various biochemical and biophysical methods have been used to study quality of different meat types, especially broiler meat. Here, the authors demonstrate the use of high-resolution time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) mass spectrometry to assess how variations in animal nutrition affect concentrations of specific lipids in the meat, such as cholesterol and vitamin E. In the presented experiment, there were four different dietary treatments. Feed for animals in the first group was supplemented with soy oil in 50%, the second group's feed was supplemented with linseed oil in 50%, a combination of these two oils in the proportion of 44%:56% was used for the third group, and in the reference group, animals were fed with beef tallow. From each group, four individuals were selected for further analysis. Positive and negative ion mass spectra were generated from the pectoralis superficialis muscle tissue of the left carcass side of each one animal. Using TOF-SIMS with a bismuth cluster ion source (Bi3 (+)), and based on characteristic peaks for cholesterol in the positive mode and vitamin E in the negative mode, the authors have illustrated the relationship of these lipids levels to the various feeding regimens. Simultaneously, the authors characterized the varying dependences on the concentrations of measured lipids in fat and muscle fibers. The cholesterol concentration in muscle fibers was the lowest in the group fed with soybean oil and the highest in reference group IV (tallow feed). In the fatty region, the highest level of cholesterol was found in the third group. The highest concentrations of vitamin E were found in the fibers of the first group and the fat region of the second group. The obtained results show that SIMS imaging is a useful approach for assessing changes in lipid concentrations in the meat tissue from animals on different diets and provides a foundation for future research.

As for prenylated flavonoids from C. tricuspidata, these metabolites were decreased at the early stage of fermentation, and were increased at end of the fermentation. In terms of the functional food product, various metabolites derived from diverse natural products in CLM had complementary effects and demonstrated higher antioxidant and pancreatic lipase inhibition activities after fermentation; these activities were closely related to flavonoid aglycones including genistein, daidzein, glycitein, luteolin, and quercetin. In an in vivo experiment, several clinical parameters affected by HFD were improved by the administration of either CLM or FCLM, but there was a difference in the antiobesity effects. The levels of lysoPCs with C20:4, C16:0, and C22:6 were significantly attenuated by CLM administration, while the attenuated levels of lysoPCs with C20:4 and C18:2 were significantly restored by FCLM administration. These metabolites may explain the above-mentioned differences in antiobesity effects. Although only the changes in plasma lysophospholipids could not fully explain antiobesity effects between non-fermented and fermented plant mixtures from our results, we suggest that metabolomics approach could provide a way to reveal the metabolite alterations in the complex fermentation process and understand the differences or changes in bioactivity according to fermentation.

Conventional resistance breeding strategies are hindered by the absence of tractable genetic resistance in any crop host. Understanding the biology and pathogenicity mechanisms of this fungus is important for addressing these disease issues, however, little is known about howR. solanicauses disease. This study capitalizes on recent genomic studies by applying mass spectrometry based proteomics to identify soluble, membrane-bound and culture filtrate proteins produced under wheat infection and vegetative growth conditions. Many of the proteins found in the culture filtrate had predicted functions relating to modification of the plant cell wall, a major activity required for pathogenesis on the plant host, including a number found only under infection conditions. Other infection related proteins included a high proportion of proteins with redox associated functions and many novel proteins without functional classification. The majority of infection only proteins tested were confirmed to show transcript up-regulation during infection including a thaumatin which increased susceptibility toR. solaniwhen expressed inNicotiana benthamiana In addition, analysis of expression during infection of different plant hosts highlighted how the infection strategy of this broad host range pathogen can be adapted to the particular host being encountered.

The results showed that relative amounts (RAs) of the most detected VAs were firstly increased to maximum values in oil samples collected at the second hour of the seventh day and the values were then decreased with the increase in the time of oil heating process (control). However, for food frying processes, the time needed for reaching maximum RAs of VAs was shorter and the values were decreased with the increase in frying time. Significant change in contents of the VAs was observed for oil samples fried with CBM due to the high contents of water, protein, and lipid content compared to oil samples fried with WD. Based on the obtained results, free radical reaction, particularly positional isomerization and cis-trans isomerization, was deduced to occur when WD or CBM was fried in SBO.

A novel mixed-mode phenyl-hexyl chromatographic column was employed in this off-line two-dimensional separation system. The phenyl-hexyl column combined the features of traditional C18 and silver-ion columns, which could provide hydrophobic interactions with triacylglycerols under acetonitrile conditions and can offer π-π interactions with triacylglycerols under methanol conditions. When compared with traditional off-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography employing two different chromatographic columns (C18 and silver-ion column) and using elution solvents comprised of two phases (reversed-phase/normal-phase) for triacylglycerols separation, the novel off-line comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography using a single column can be achieved by simply altering the mobile phase between acetonitrile and methanol, which exhibited a much higher selectivity for the separation of triacylglycerols with great efficiency and rapid speed. In addition, an approach based on the use of response factor with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry has been developed for triacylglycerols quantification. Due to the differences between saturated and unsaturated acyl chains, the use of response factors significantly improves the quantitation of triacylglycerols.

Because indoor pollution has a more substantial impact on human health than outdoor pollution, PAHs from cooking fumes have drawn considerable attention.

Controlled experiments were conducted to collect gas- and particulate-phase PAHs emitted from the cooking oil fumes, and PAH concentrations were quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results show that deep-frying methods generate more PAHs and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) (1.3 and 10.9 times, respectively) because they consume greater volumes of edible oil and involve higher oil temperatures relative to those of frying methods. In addition, the total B[a]Peq concentration of deep-frying is 2.2-fold larger than that of frying.

25566290,"Plasmopara viticola, the causal agent of grapevine downy mildew, is one of the most devastating grape pathogen in Europe and North America. Although phytochemicals are used to control pathogen infections, the appearance of resistant strains and the concern for possible adverse effects on environment and human health are increasing the search for alternative strategies. In the present investigation, we successfully tested two protein hydrolysates from soybean (soy) and casein (cas) to trigger grapevine resistance against P. viticola. On Vitis vinifera cv. Marselan plants, the application of soy and cas reduced the infected leaf surface by 76 and 63%, as compared to the control, respectively. Since both hydrolysates might trigger the plant immunity, we investigated their ability to elicit grapevine defense responses. On grapevine cell suspensions, a different free cytosolic calcium signature was recorded for each hydrolysate, whereas a similar transient phosphorylation of two MAP kinases of 45 and 49 kDa was observed. These signaling events were followed by transcriptome reprogramming, including the up-regulation of defense genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and the stilbene synthase enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of resveratrol, the main grapevine phytoalexin. Liquid chromatography analyses confirmed the production of resveratrol and its dimer metabolites, δ- and ε-viniferins. Overall, soy effects were more pronounced as compared to the cas ones. Both hydrolysates proved to act as elicitors to enhance grapevine immunity against pathogen attack.

The candidate certified reference material, NMIJ CRM 7509-a, that was prepared from the raw soybeans containing target pesticides (diazinon, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos, and permethrin) was used as the test sample. Forty participants submitted two sets of analytical results along with the details of the analytical method and conditions they applied. Two types of assigned values were established for each target pesticide: one was derived from the analytical results of the participants, and the other was provided from the analytical results by isotope-dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS). The latter values were 7.4-16% higher than the former values, plausibly because the analytical values from the IDMS measurements were not affected by the recovery ratio of the target pesticides during the analytical process. Thus, two kinds of z-scores were calculated for individual participants using the corresponding assigned values: one (z1-score) showed the relative performance score for the present PT and the other (z2-score) could be used for evaluation of the trueness of their analytical methods.

In order to overcome these limitations, an ultrasensitive and quantitative immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for rapid and sensitive quantitation of ochratoxin A (OTA) was developed. The assay was based on a competitive format and its sensitivity was improved by using a sensitive and selective OTA monoclonal antibody (OTA-mAb). The visible ICA results were obtained within 15 min, and in addition to visual examination, they were read by the rapid color intensity portable strip reader. The visual and computational detection limits (vLOD and cLOD, respectively) for ochratoxin A were 0.2 and 0.25 ng mL(-1), respectively. These values were lower than those reported by previous studies in a range 5-2500 folds. For validation, contaminated samples including wheat, maize, rice and soybean were assayed by ICA and a standard high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results were in good agreement for both ICA and HPLC methods.

There is a need to deplete the vicilins from maize embryo extracts for enhanced proteomics analysis. We here reported a chloroform-assisted phenol extraction (CAPE) method for vicilin depletion. By CAPE, maize embryo proteins were first extracted in an aqueous buffer, denatured by chloroform and then subjected to phenol extraction. We found that CAPE can effectively deplete the vicilins from maize embryo extract, allowing the detection of low-abundance proteins that were masked by vicilins in 2-DE gel. The novelty of CAPE is that it selectively depletes abundant storage proteins from embryo extracts of both monocot (maize) and dicot (soybean and pea) seeds, whereas other embryo proteins were not depleted. CAPE can significantly improve proteome profiling of embryos and extends the application of chloroform and phenol extraction in plant proteomics.

The biodiesel samples were prepared using n-propanol as an emulsifier, 10% (v/v) nitric acid as the aqueous phase, and biodiesel. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed to determine the microemulsion region with the specified components. The optimized conditions for microemulsion formation were 57.6% (v/v) n-propanol, 21.2% (v/v) biodiesel, and 21.2% (v/v) nitric acid solution. The stability of the microemulsified system was investigated using aqueous and organic standards, and the system was found to be stable for at least 240 min. The applied pyrolysis and atomization temperatures were 800 and 2000 °C, respectively, and 5 μg of aluminum was used as the chemical modifier. The obtained limits of detection and quantification were 0.2 and 0.5 μg kg(-1), respectively, and the characteristic mass was 1.6 pg. The precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation (% R.S.D., n = 10), was 2.5% for a sample with a cadmium concentration of 6.5 μg kg(-1). The accuracy was determined from addition and recovery experiments, with results varying from 93 to 108% recovery. This study demonstrates that the proposed method based on the use of a microemulsion formation in sample preparation can be applied as an efficient alternative for the determination of cadmium in biodiesel by GFAAS. Cadmium determination in biodiesel samples of different origins (soybean, corn, cotton, and sunflower) was evaluated after acid digestion using the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique, and the obtained results were compared to the results obtained using the proposed method.

A method for the simultaneous determination of the four mycotoxins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was validated by a small-scale interlaboratory study using two spiked wheat samples (DON was spiked at 20 and 100 μg/kg and ZEN, T-2, and HT-2 at 6 and 20 μg/kg in the respective samples). The recovery of the four mycotoxins ranged from 77.3 to 107.2%. A total of 557 samples of 10 different commodities were analyzed over 3 years by this validated method. Both T-2 and HT-2 were detected in wheat, wheat flour, barley, Job's tears products, beer, corn grits, azuki beans, soybeans, and rice with mixed grains. Only T-2 toxin was detected in sesame seeds. The highest concentrations of T-2 toxin (48.4 μg/kg) and HT-2 toxin (85.0 μg/kg) were present in azuki beans and wheat, respectively. DON was frequently detected in wheat, wheat flour, beer, and corn grits. The contamination level of wheat was below the provisional standard in Japan (1,100 μg/kg).

25079171,"Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine) is registered as a herbicide for many food and non-food crops, as well as non-crop areas where total vegetation control is desired. Glyphosate influences the soil mycobiota; however, the possible effect of glyphosate residues in animal feed (soybean, corn, etc.) on animal mycobiota is almost unknown. Accordingly, the present study was initiated to investigate the mycological characteristics of dairy cows in relationship to glyphosate concentrations in urine. A total of 258 dairy cows on 14 dairy farms in Germany were examined. Glyphosate was detected in urine using ELISA. The fungal profile was analyzed in rumen fluid samples using conventional microbiological culture techniques and differentiated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. LPS-binding protein (LBP) and antibodies (IgG1, IgG2, IgA, and IgM) against fungi were determined in blood using ELISA. Different populations of Lichtheimia corymbifera, Lichtheimia ramosa, Mucor, and Rhizopus were detected. L. corymbifera and L. ramosa were significantly more abundant in animals containing high glyphosate (>40 ng/ml) concentrations in urine. There were no significant changes in IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies toward isolated fungi that were related to glyphosate concentration in urine; however, IgA antibodies against L. corymbifera and L. ramosa were significantly lower in the higher glyphosate groups.

To prevent the distribution of Cd-contaminated food, a simple and quick on-site test for measuring Cd concentrations in agricultural products is needed. Recently, an immunochromatography kit developed for determining Cd in rice was reported to be useful for determining Cd in many other crops. We conducted an interlaboratory study to evaluate the kit for determining Cd in cereals (wheat and rice) and soybeans. Ten test materials were used, and 12 test samples including two sets of blind duplicates were distributed to 12 laboratories in Japan. The Cd recoveries (relative to certified values or values determined by inductively coupled plasma-MS) from all test materials were 84.6-125.1%. Repeatability RSD values of the test materials ranged from 8.8 to 14.8%. Reproducibility RSD values ranged from 13.4 to 27.6%, averaging 21.3%. The Horwitz ratio ranged from 0.61 to 1.36.

Our goals were to determine which species had the greatest capacity to damage soybean seed and to measure the effect of that damage on the nutritional composition of soybean seed. Individuals of the three species were provided with a preweighed dry soybean seed and allowed to feed for 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 d, after which the remaining seed was analyzed for any change in weight, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate concentration. Lipids, carbohydrates, and seed weights were reduced by bug feeding, and the reduction was directly proportional to feeding duration. H. halys was found to be the most voracious feeder, reducing soybean seed weight by 42% after 24 d of feeding. There was a significant interaction between species and feeding duration for changes in nutritional components. Seeds fed on by H. halys had the highest incremental increase in protein content (13%) after 24 d of feeding, followed by those fed on by R. pedestris and P. hybneri. However, carbohydrates and lipid content of the soybean seeds fed by the tested insect species were found to decrease significantly.

24731621,"Studies of protein nutrition and biochemistry require reliable methods for analysis of amino acid (AA) composition in polypeptides of animal tissues and foods. Proteins are hydrolyzed by 6M HCl (110°C for 24h), 4.2M NaOH (105°C for 20 h), or proteases. Analytical techniques that require high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) include pre-column derivatization with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan, 9-fluorenyl methylchloroformate, phenylisothiocyanate, naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde, 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate, and o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA). OPA reacts with primary AA (except cysteine or cystine) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol or 3-mercaptopropionic acid to form a highly fluorescent adduct. OPA also reacts with 4-amino-1-butanol and 4-aminobutane-1,3-diol produced from oxidation of proline and 4-hydroxyproline, respectively, in the presence of chloramine-T plus sodium borohydride at 60°C, or with S-carboxymethyl-cysteine formed from cysteine and iodoacetic acid at 25°C. Fluorescence of OPA derivatives is monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 455 nm, respectively. Detection limits are 50 fmol for AA. This technique offers the following advantages: simple procedures for preparation of samples, reagents, and mobile-phase solutions; rapid pre-column formation of OPA-AA derivatives and their efficient separation at room temperature (e.g., 20-25°C); high sensitivity of detection; easy automation on the HPLC apparatus; few interfering side reactions; a stable chromatography baseline for accurate integration of peak areas; and rapid regeneration of guard and analytical columns. Thus, the OPA method provides a useful tool to determine AA composition in proteins of animal tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle, liver, intestine, placenta, brain, and body homogenates) and foods (e.g., milk, corn grain, meat, and soybean meal).","Journal of chromatography.

Furthermore, the α' subunit of β-conglycinin has specifically been shown to possess low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol-lowering activity. Therefore, accumulation of the α' subunit of β-conglycinin in rice seeds could lead to the production of new functional rice that could promote human health. Herein, we used the low-glutelin rice mutant 'Koshihikari' (var. a123) and suppressed its glutelins and prolamins, the major seed storage proteins of rice, by RNA interference. The accumulation levels of the α' subunit in the lines with suppressed glutelin and prolamin levels were >20 mg in 1 g of rice seeds, which is considerably higher than those in previous studies. Oral administration of the transgenic rice containing the α' subunit exhibited a hypocholesterolemic activity in rats; the serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were significantly reduced when compared to those of the control rice (var. a123). The cholesterol-lowering action by transgenic rice accumulating the α' subunit induces a significant increase in fecal bile acid excretion and a tendency to increase in fecal cholesterol excretion.

FASRAC (Food Automatic Analytical Systems for Residual Agricultural Chemicals) automatically performs extraction of pesticide residues from agricultural products with acetonitrile, filtration, constant volume, mixing with the use of air, mixing acetonitrile with buffer solvent, separation, and dehydration with sodium sulfate. The extract was purified with a GC/NH2 column. For wheat flour and soybeans, a purification step with a C18 column was added before a GC/NH2 column. After removal of the solvent, the extract was resolved in n-hexane/acetone solvent for GC-MS/MS analysis. In the case of manual analysis, pesticide residues were analyzed according to official multiresidue methods and purification steps were the same as in FASRAC. Recovery tests were performed with wheat flour, soybeans, spinach and apples, by addition of 302 pesticides at the concentrations 0.01 mg/kg. The results indicate that automatic extraction using FASRAC is superior to manual analysis in trueness, repeatability and within-run reproducibility.

Calibration models predicting odor measured by dilution olfactometry from NMVOC concentrations via orthogonal projection to latent structures (O-PLS) made good predictions (Rp(2)=0.83-0.87, RMSEp=137-175OU) using one to eight NMVOCs with either one or two latent variables representing odor concentration and character, respectively. Similar changes in odorant composition were observed in each sampling campaign, with samples collected early in the day more odorous and more sulfurous than samples collected later in the day. High litter moisture favored sulfur-containing odorants over alcohols, aldehydes and ketones but had little bearing on perceived odor, whereas high bird density favored alcohols, aldehydes and ketones over sulfur-containing odorants. Eight VOCs that were important predictors of odor across all sheds in order of decreasing importance were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), 2-3 butanedione, 3-methyl-butanal, 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, acetoin, and 2-butanone. Four additional NMVOCs also influenced perceived odor although less predictably; these were n-hexane, 2-butanol, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and 1-octen-3-ol. All of the odorants are associated with microbial or fungal activity in the litter and manure, except n-hexane, which may originate from hexane-extracted soybean meal in the chicken feed.

24016262,"With the wide application of plastics, the contamination of plasticizers migrating from plastic materials in the environment is becoming ubiquitous. The presence of phthalates, the major group of plasticizers, in edible items has gained increasingly more concern due to their endocrine disrupting property. In this study, 15 plasticizers in 21 edible vegetable oils purchased from a U.S. retail market were analyzed using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) were detected in all oil samples. Benzylbutyl phthalate (BzBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were detected at a rate of 95.2, 90.5, and 90.5%, respectively. The detection rates for all other plasticizers ranged from 0 to 57.1%. The content of total plasticizers in oil samples was determined to be 210-7558 μg/kg, which was comparable to the content range in oil marketed in Italy. Although no significant difference (p = 0.05) in the total content of plasticizer was observed among oil species (soybean, canola, corn, and olive), the wider range and higher average of total content of plasticizers in olive oil than other oil species indicated the inconsistence of plasticizer contamination in olive oil and a possible priority for quality monitoring. No significant difference (p = 0.05) in the total content of plasticizers was found among glass-bottle (n = 4), plastic-bottle (n = 14), and metal-can (n = 3) packaging, implying that oil packaging is not the major cause of plasticizer contamination. The daily intake amount of plasticizers contained in edible oil on this U.S. retail market constituted only a minimum percentage of reference dose established by US EPA, thus no obvious toxicological effect might be caused. However, the fact that DEHP content in two olive oils exceeded relevant special migration limits (SMLs) of Europe and China might need attention.

Lotus japonicus (Lotus) is an established legume plant model system for studies of symbiotic and pathogenic microbial interactions and, due to its well characterized genotype/phenotype and easily manipulated genome, may also be suitable for studies of legume food allergy. Here we present a comprehensive study of the Lotus N-glycoproteome. The global and site-specific N-glycan structures of Lotus seed globulins were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based glycomics and glycoproteomics techniques. In total, 19 N-glycan structures comprising high mannose (∼20%), pauci-mannosidic (∼40%), and complex forms (∼40%) were determined. The pauci-mannosidic and complex N-glycans contained high amounts of the typical plant determinants β-1,2-xylose and α-1,3-fucose. Two abundant Lotus seed N-glycoproteins were site-specifically profiled; a predicted lectin containing two fully occupied N-glycosylation sites carried predominantly pauci-mannosidic structures in different distributions. In contrast, Lotus convicilin storage protein 2 (LCP2) carried exclusively high mannose N-glycans similar to its homologue, Ara h 1, which is the major allergen in peanut. In silico investigation confirmed that peanut Ara h 1 and Lotus LCP2 are highly similar at the primary and higher protein structure levels. Hence, we suggest that Lotus has the potential to serve as a model system for studying the role of seed proteins and their glycosylation in food allergy.

Individual supplementation of 1 % maltose, lactose, sucrose, peptone, soybean meal and yeast extract enhanced COD production by 80-110 % in comparison to the basal production medium (2.4 U/ml). Supplementation of 0.05 % cholesterol (inducer) enhanced COD production by 150 %. COD was purified 14.3-fold and its molecular weight was found to be 62 kDa.

23675783,"Rice, the staple food of south and east Asian counties, is considered to be hypoallergenic. However, several clinical studies have documented rice-induced allergy in sensitive patients. Rice proteins with molecular weights of 14-16, 26, 33, and 56 kDa have been identified as allergens. Recently, it was documented that the 56 kDa rice allergen was responsible for rice-induced anaphylaxis. The 14-16 kDa allergens have been identified as α-amylase inhibitors; the 26 kDa protein has been identified as α-globulin; and the 33 kDa protein has been identified as glyoxalase I. However, the identity of the 56 kDa rice allergen has not yet been determined. In this study, we demonstrate that serum from patients allergic to maize shows IgE binding to a 56 kDa protein that was present in both maize and rice but not in the oil seeds soybean and peanut. The 56 kDa IgE-binding protein was abundant in the rice endosperm. We have purified this protein from rice endosperm and demonstrated its reactivity to IgE antibodies from the serum of maize-allergic patients. The purified protein was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, resulting in identification of this rice allergen as granule-bound starch synthase, a product of the Waxy gene. Immunoblot analysis using protein extracts from a waxy mutant of rice revealed the absence of the 56 kDa IgE-binding protein. Our results demonstrate that the 56 kDa rice allergen is granule-bound starch synthase and raise the possibility of using waxy mutants of rice as a potential source of the hypoallergenic diet for patients sensitized to the 56 kDa rice allergen.

Almond prunin (Pru du 6), an 11S globulin (legumin), is an abundant nut seed protein and a major allergen. Conformational epitope mapping studies of prunin have been performed with a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4C10. This mAb reacts with non-reduced but not reduced prunin in immunoblotting assays, indicating the recognition of a conformational epitope. 4C10 competes with patient IgE, as assessed by ELISA, indicating clinical significance of the epitope. To characterize the 4C10 epitope, hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) monitored by 14.5 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on the native prunin-4C10 complex and on uncomplexed native prunin. Several epitope candidate peptides that differ in deuterium uptake between the complexed and uncomplexed forms were identified. The epitope was further mapped by analyzing chimeric molecules incorporating segments of the homologous soybean allergen, Gly m 6, in immunoassays.

The aim of this study was to separate and purify and to identify antifungal compounds of bacterium associated with novel entomopathogenic nematode and check the antifungal property of identified compound in particular food model systems. The antifungal compound was purified using silica gel column chromatography, TLC and HPLC and its structure was elucidated using NMR (¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, ¹H-¹H COSY, ¹H-¹³C HMBC), HRMS and Marfey's method. Based on the spectral data, the active compounds were identified as diketopiperazine [cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu)]. The antifungal activity of cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) was studied by MIC and paper disk assay against Aspergillus flavus MTCC 277 and Aspergillus niger MTCC 282 and best MIC value of 8μg/ml was recorded against A. flavus. Cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) strongly inhibit mycelia growth of fungus and thereby affecting aflatoxin production. To investigate the potential application of the cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) and to eliminate fungal spoilage in food and feed, soybean and peanut were used as models. White mycelia and dark/pale green spores of A. flavus were observed in the control soybeans after 2-day incubation. However the fungal growth was not observed in soybeans treated with cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu). Almost the same result was observed for peanuts treated with cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) for A. niger. The cyclo(l-Pro-d-Leu) was nontoxic to two normal human cell lines (FS normal fibroblast and L231 lung epithelial) up to 200μg/ml.

23281487,"At the present, no secreted phospholipase A₂ (sPLA₂) from soybean (Glycine max) was investigated in detail. In this work we identified five sequences of putative secreted sPLA₂ from soybean after a BLAST search in G. max database. Sequence analysis showed a conserved PA2c domain bearing the Ca²⁺ binding loop and the active site motif. All the five mature proteins contain 12 cysteine residues, which are commonly conserved in plant sPLA₂s. We propose a phylogenetic tree based on sequence alignment of reported plant sPLA₂s including the novel enzymes from G. max. According to PLA₂ superfamily, two of G. max sPLA₂s are grouped as XIA and the rest of sequences as XIB, on the basis of differences found in their molecular weights and deviating sequences especially in the N- and C-terminal regions of the isoenzymes. Furthermore, we report the cloning, expression and purification of one of the putative isoenzyme denoted as GmsPLA₂-XIA-1. We demonstrate that this mature sPLA₂ of 114 residues had PLA₂ activity on Triton:phospholipid mixed micelles and determine the kinetic parameters for this system. We generate a model based on the known crystal structure of sPLA₂ from rice (isoform II), giving first insights into the three-dimensional structure of folded GmsPLA₂-XIA-1. Besides describing the spatial arrangement of highly conserved pair HIS-49/ASP-50 and the Ca⁺² loop domains, we propose the putative amino acids involved in the interfacial recognition surface.

Despite the severity of allergic reactions and growing prevalence in children and adults, there is no cure for peanut allergy, leaving avoidance as the primary mode of treatment. To improve analytical methods for peanut allergen detection, researchers must overcome obstacles involved in handling complex food matrices while attempting to decipher the chemistry that underlies allergen protein interactions. To address such challenges, we conducted a global proteome characterization of raw peanuts using a sophisticated GELFrEE-PAGE-LC-MS/MS platform consisting of gel-based protein fractionation followed by mass spectrometric identification. The in-solution mass-selective protein fractionation: (1) enhances the number of unique peptide identifications, (2) provides a visual map of protein isoforms, and (3) aids in the identification of disulfide-linked protein complexes. GELFrEE-PAGE-LC-MS/MS not only overcomes many of the challenges involved in the study of plant proteomics, but enriches the understanding of peanut protein chemistry, which is typically unattainable in a traditional bottom-up proteomic analysis.

22969785,"Soybean (Glycinemax) is a hugely valuable soft commodity that generates tens of billions of dollars annually. This value is due in part to the balanced composition of the seed which is roughly 1:2:2 oil, starch, and protein by weight. In turn, the seeds have many uses with various derivatives appearing broadly in processed food products. As is true with many edible seeds, soybeans contain proteins that are anti-nutritional factors and allergens. Soybean, along with milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and wheat, elicit a majority of food allergy reactions in the United States. Soybean seed composition can be affected by breeding, and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture, insect/pathogen load, and/or soil nutrient levels). The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of genotype and environment on allergen and anti-nutritional proteins in soybean. To address genetic and environmental effects, four varieties of non-GM soybeans were grown in six geographically distinct regions of North America (Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Ontario, and Pennsylvania). Absolute quantification of proteins by mass spectrometry can be achieved with a technique called multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), during which signals from an endogenous protein are compared to those from a synthetic heavy-labeled internal standard. Using MRM, eight allergens were absolutely quantified for each variety in each environment. Statistical analyses show that for most allergens, the effects of environment far outweigh the differences between varieties brought about by breeding.",Frontiers in plant science,[],[],Environmental effects on allergen levels in commercially grown non-genetically modified soybeans: assessing variation across north america.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22969785,2012

Sugar content analysis revealed that the composition of maltose, maltotriose, sucrose, and erlose varied significantly over time in accordance with the composition of the syrup fed to the bees. When corn and cereal starch hydrolysates were fed to the bees, the maltose and maltotriose contents of the RJs increased up to 5.0 and 1.3 %, respectively, compared to the levels seen in authentic samples (i.e., samples obtained when the bees were fed natural food: honey and pollen) that were inferior to 0.2% and not detected, respectively. The sucrose and erlose contents of natural RJs were around 0.2 %, whereas those in RJs obtained when the bees were fed cane or beet sugar were as much as 4.0 and 1.3 %, respectively.

The P34 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) as an inclusion body under the induction of 0.8 mmol/L isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After purification with His-Bind affinity chromatography, the purity quotient of the recombinant protein was over 92 %, and its molecular weight (approximately 33 kDa) was very close to that of the native soybean P34. The polyclonal antibody (pAB) against P34 was prepared with the purified recombinant P34. The generated pAB, named as pAB-P34, exhibited high specificity to the P34 protein of the soybean meal. The indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) based on pAB-P34 was established to determine the P34 content of soybean products. The CVs of the recovery tests of P34 were less than 7.77 %, which indicated that iELISA had high reproducibility and accuracy.

The mean recoveries for spiked heptacosanol and octacosanol in vegetable oil were 102.3% and 106.3%, respectively. The total PC contents in the vegetable oils varied from 3.01 to 427.83 mg/kg oil. Perilla seed, grape seed, and rice bran oils were found to be highly rich sources of PCs, containing 427.83, 245.15, and 171.17 mg PCs/kg oil, respectively. Corn, sesame, and soybean oils contained only a negligible quantity of PCs. The PC composition in vegetable oils was greatly source dependent. In perilla seed oil, octacosanol was the single most predominant component, representing 55.93% of the total PC. In grape seed oil, however, hexacosanol is the most abundant PC, followed by octacosanol, tetracosanol, and triacontanol in a decreasing order.

Two syringe-driven chelating columns (SDCCs), Nobias Chelate PB-1M and InertSep ME-1, were investigated in the present experiment. The results of the pH dependence of Mo removal rates showed that separation of Cd and Mo could be obtained at pH conditions over 7.

Furthermore, it was found that InertSep ME-1 was more effective for separating Cd from the interfering elements, with removal rates approximately 100% for Mo, Zr, and Sn while the recovery of Cd was approximately 100%. The optimized SPE operations were as follows: 0.6 mL of NH(4)OH was added into each 10 mL of digested sample solution; the sample solution was loaded into each pre-cleaned SDCCs at a flow rate of 5 mL min(-1); after 5 mL of ultrapure water was passed through the SDCC for washing, 2 mL of 0.3M HNO(3) was passed through to elute Cd and the eluent was subjected to ICP-MS measurement.

22220906,"The aim of this study was to apply an untargeted NMR and LC-MS-based metabolomics approach to detect potential differences between an organically and a conventionally produced feed, which caused statistically significant differences in growth, in the response to an immunological challenge and in the gene expression profiles in the small intestine of laying hens. A fractionation procedure was set up to create multiple fractions of the feed, which were subsequently analysed by NMR and UPLC-TOF/MS operating in positive mode. Comparison of the profiles revealed that the most apparent differences came from the isoflavones in the soy as well as a compound with a molecular mass of 441.202 (M + 1)⁺, which was identified as N,N'-diferuloylputrescine (DFP) and came from the corn. Whether the observed differences in effects are due to the higher levels of isoflavones and DFP is unclear, as is the fact whether the observed differences are typical for organic or conventional produced corn and soy. However, this study shows that this metabolomics approach is suitable for detecting potential differences between products, even in levels of compounds that would have been overlooked with a more targeted approach. As such, the method is suitable for a more systematic study on differences between conventionally and organically produced food.","Food additives & contaminants.

For analysis normal phase column was used with mobile phase consisting of hexane:isopropanol:acetic acid (98.9:0.6:0.5) with isocratic elution and fluorescence detection. Excellent separation of all isomers was obtained along with adequate quantification in the foods analyzed. Recovery rates of standards ranged from 91.3 to 99.4%. The linearity range for each isomer varied from 2.5 to 137.5 ng/mL (R² greater than 0.995 in all cases). Detection limits ranged from 21.0 to 48.0 ng/mL for tocopherols and from 56.0 to 67.0 ng/mL for tocotrienols, while quantification limits ranged from 105.0 to 240.0 ng/mL for tocopherols and from 280.0 to 335.0 ng/mL for tocotrienols.

Continuous-flow hydride generation electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (HG-ET AAS) with in situ trapping on an iridium-coated graphite tube has been chosen because of the high sensitivity and relative simplicity. The microwave-assisted acid digestion for bean and soil samples was tested for complete recovery of inorganic and organic selenium compounds (selenomethionine). The reduction of Se(VI) to Se(IV) was optimized in order to guarantee that there is no back-oxidation, which is of importance when digested samples are not analyzed immediately after the reduction step.

The present study investigated the effects of a diet containing thermally oxidized soybean oil (TO) or TO supplemented with probiotic Bifidobacteria (TO+Pro) on the serum lipid profile and oxidative stress biomarkers of male rats. The data showed several indicators of oil deterioration after thermal processing, including high levels of % free fatty acid (FFA; 15-fold), acid value (AV; 14-fold), peroxide value (8-fold), p-anisidine value (AnV; 39-fold), total oxidation value (TOTOX; 19-fold), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) value (8.5-fold), and trans-FA (TFA) isomers (2.5-fold) compared to the control. The rats that were fed a diet containing TO showed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in body weight gain, food efficiency values, and liver weight. Furthermore, the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were increased, while the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level was decreased in blood serum samples. High levels of TBARS, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were also detected in the livers, kidneys, testes, and brains of rats. Interestingly, a diet containing TO+Pro restored all biological parameters to their control values.

The selected reaction monitoring was performed on [M+H](+) of m/z 127.9 to provide the transition of 127>85 and 127>68 (MEL) while the [M-H](-) of m/z 127.1 was selected as the precursor ion for CYA resulting in product ions m/z 85 and 42. Isotope labeled internal standard ((15)N(3)-MEL and (13)C(3)-CYA) and matrix-matched calibration were both used to observe the recovery to be 70.0-129.6% and 70.0-128.9% with RSD of 1.4-23.3% and 1.5-21.7% for MEL and CYA, respectively (n=6). All the LODs and LOQs of MEL and CYA were less than 39.4 and 99.1μgkg(-1), respectively, in 18 matrices, which were sensitive enough for quantitative analysis.

20842699,"2,4-D, dicamba and 4-CPA with auxin-like activity have been intensively used in agriculture, for the control of unwanted broadleaf weeds. An analytical method involving HPLC coupled with UVD was developed for the simultaneous analysis of these three analytes in Chinese cabbage, apple and pepper fruits (representative non-fatty samples) and brown rice and soybean (representative fatty samples) using liquid-liquid partitioning and column cleanup procedures. The residues were confirmed via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in ion electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. The standard curves were linear over the range of the tested concentrations (0.25-10 microg/mL), as shown by a marked linearity in excess of 0.9999 (r(2) ). The average recoveries (mean, n = 3) ranged from 94.30 to 102.63 in Chinese cabbage, from 94.76 to 108.47 in apple, from 97.52 to 102.27 in pepper, from 76.19 to 101.90 in brown rice, and from 74.60 to 107.39 in soybean. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were <9% in all tested matrices. The limits of detection and quantitation were 0.006 and 0.02 mg/kg, respectively.

Previous studies showed that this 43-amino acid peptide has the ability to suppress chemical carcinogen-induced transformation in mammalian cells and skin carcinogenesis in mice. In this study, we attempted to use the Escherichia coli T7 expression system for expression of lunasin. The lunasin gene was synthesized by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with the use of vector pET29a. The recombinant lunasin containing his-tag at the C-terminus was expressed in soluble form which could be purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. After 4 h, the expression level is above 4.73 mg of recombinant his-tagged lunasin/L of Luria-Bertani broth. It does not affect the bacterial growth and expression levels. This is the first study that successfully uses E. coli as a host to produce valuable bioactive lunasin. The result of in vitro bioassay showed that the purified recombinant lunasin can inhibit histone acetylation. Recombinant lunasin also inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and nitric oxide production).

20491474,"Soybean and maize are extensively used in animal feed, primarily in poultry, swine, and cattle diets. Soybean meal can affect pig performance in the first few weeks following weaning and elicit specific antibodies in weaned piglets. Though maize is a major component of pig feed, it is not known if any of the maize proteins can elicit immunological response in young pigs. In this study, we have identified a prominent 27 kDa protein from maize as an immunodominant protein in young pigs. This protein, like some known allergens, exhibited resistance to pepsin digestion in vitro. Several lines of evidence identify the immunodominant 27 kDa protein as a gamma-zein, a maize seed storage protein. First, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of different solubility classes of maize seed proteins revealed the presence of an abundant 27 kDa protein in the prolamin (zein) fraction. Antibodies raised against the purified maize 27 kDa gamma-zein also reacted against the same protein recognized by the young pig serum. Additionally, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of the peptides generated by trypsin digestion of the immunodominant 27 kDa protein showed significant homology to the maize 27 kDa gamma-zein.

Many studies showed that isoflavones are active in the prevention of many human diseases. However, the correct processing techniques used to prepare the soy foodstuffs are important to maintain the active forms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma irradiation on the isoflavone contents of the defatted soybean flour when compared with soybean molasses, a derivative from the soybean food production. After extracting phenolic compounds with methanol aqueous solution (80%), isoflavones were detected by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/diode-array detector. The radiation doses of 2 and 5 kGy presented a small effect on the isoflavones content of defatted soy flour. Samples irradiated at 50 kGy showed lower isoflavone contents. The observed reduction in the concentration of isoflavones-daidzein, glycitein and genistein-induced by gamma radiation in soy molasses was not significant in defatted soy flour, thus suggesting that isoflavones in defatted soy flour were not eliminated by gamma radiation at rates up to 50 kGy.",International journal of food sciences and nutrition,"['D002851', 'D004032', 'D005433', 'D005511', 'D005720', 'D019833', 'D006801', 'D007529', 'D012639', 'D045730', 'D013025']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diet', 'Flour', 'Food Handling', 'Gamma Rays', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones', 'Seeds', 'Soy Foods', 'Soybeans']",Changes in isoflavone profiles of soybean treated with gamma irradiation.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22519677,2013

The enzyme is routinely produced in suspensions of soybean meal and has until now been purified by several steps of fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using different ion exchangers. The final protein fraction had a molecular mass of 46 kDa but still consisted of several incompletely separated proteins with slightly differing isoelectric points (pI 5.2, 5.6, 6.1), probably representing differently glycosylated isoforms. This made it difficult to further purify the individual protein forms. Since homogeneous protein fractions are a pre-requisite for X-ray crystallography and specific structure-function studies, an appropriate FPLC procedure was developed starting with pre-purification of crude peroxygenase on SP Sepharose followed by chromatofocusing on a Mono P column and elution with a pH gradient. Three sufficiently separated main protein peaks were eluted from the Mono P column and confirmed to be distinct forms of aromatic peroxygenase with different pIs.

A highly glycolipid-enriched sample containing the entire glycolipid moiety of the lecithin was obtained using an optimized batch procedure with silica gel. This sample was subsequently used to gain individual glycolipid classes through column chromatography on silica gel. The major glycolipid classes in the lecithins, digalactosyl diacylglycerides (1), sterol glucosides (2), acylated sterol glucosides (3), and cerebrosides (4), were identified and characterized. All isolated glycolipid classes displayed excellent baking performance. A better baking activity than that of the classical surfactants was displayed by 1, 3, and 4 and an equivalent baking activity by 2. The same glycolipid classes, except 3, of different lecithin origin showed only slight differences in their baking activities, due to different fatty acid compositions. Furthermore, the glycolipid classes influenced the crumb structure significantly by improving the crumb softness and grain. Interestingly, none of the glycolipid classes showed significant antistaling effect. A direct effect on the overall rheological behavior of the dough was only found for the commercial surfactants. However, the rheological effect seen on gluten isolated from surfactant-containing dough revealed that the surfactants could be divided into two main groups, one of them directly forming and stabilizing liquid film lamellae through adsorption to interfaces and the other indirectly increasing the surface activity of the endogenous lipids in the flour.

19129418,"We have characterized the development of seeds in the model legume Lotus japonicus. Like soybean (Glycine max) and pea (Pisum sativum), Lotus develops straight seed pods and each pod contains approximately 20 seeds that reach maturity within 40 days. Histological sections show the characteristic three developmental phases of legume seeds and the presence of embryo, endosperm, and seed coat in desiccated seeds. Furthermore, protein, oil, starch, phytic acid, and ash contents were determined, and this indicates that the composition of mature Lotus seed is more similar to soybean than to pea. In a first attempt to determine the seed proteome, both a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis approach and a gel-based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach were used. Globulins were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and five legumins, LLP1 to LLP5, and two convicilins, LCP1 and LCP2, were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. For two distinct developmental phases, seed filling and desiccation, a gel-based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach was used, and 665 and 181 unique proteins corresponding to gene accession numbers were identified for the two phases, respectively. All of the proteome data, including the experimental data and mass spectrometry spectra peaks, were collected in a database that is available to the scientific community via a Web interface (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/lotus/db.cgi). This database establishes the basis for relating physiology, biochemistry, and regulation of seed development in Lotus. Together with a new Web interface (http://bioinfoserver.rsbs.anu.edu.au/utils/PathExpress4legumes/) collecting all protein identifications for Lotus, Medicago, and soybean seed proteomes, this database is a valuable resource for comparative seed proteomics and pathway analysis within and beyond the legume family.",Plant physiology,"['D018533', 'D002853', 'D030562', 'D015180', 'D005227', 'D005916', 'D020407', 'D000070116', 'D008954', 'D020543', 'D055314', 'D012639', 'D019032', 'D013213', 'D014867']","['Biomass', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Databases, Protein', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fatty Acids', 'Globulins', 'Internet', 'Lotus', 'Models, Biological', 'Proteome', 'Seed Storage Proteins', 'Seeds', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Starch', 'Water']",The proteome of seed development in the model legume Lotus japonicus.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000196', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000378', None]","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'genetics', None, 'embryology', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'cytology', None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19129418,2009

Among 10 variables (wheat bran, soybean powder, CaCl(2), ginsenosides, KH(2)PO(4), MgSO(4), polyethylene glycol (PEG), medium volume, inoculum size, and stirring speed), it was found that wheat bran, KH(2)PO(4), and stirring speed had significant effect on beta-glucosidase activity due to very low p-values (p<0.05). Subsequently, wheat bran, KH(2)PO(4), and stirring speed were further optimized using central composite design.

Group 1 (n = 5) of anesthetized dogs served as sham-operated controls, whereas in groups 2 (n = 6) and 3 (n = 6), complete small intestinal ischemia was induced by occluding the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min. Groups 1 and 2 were fed with normal laboratory chow for 1 week before the experiments, whereas the animals in group 3 received a special diet containing 1% soybean PC.

Intestinal superoxide production and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (a marker of tissue leukocyte infiltration) were ascertained on ileal biopsy samples 180 min after reperfusion. The content of methane in the exhaled air was determined by gas chromatography. I/R was characterized by significant tissue acidosis with ROS generation and elevated MPO activity. These changes were accompanied by increased methane production in the exhaled air during reoxygenation. The PC-enriched diet prevented the decrease in intramucosal pH, diminished the intestinal superoxide generation and the MPO activity, and significantly decreased the exhaled methane concentration.

18348048,"Nineteen samples of food in glass jars with twist closures were collected by the national food inspectors at Danish food producers and a few importers, focusing on fatty food, such as vegetables in oil, herring in dressing or pickle, soft spreadable cheese, cream, dressings, peanut butter, sauces and infant food. The composition of the plasticizers in the gaskets was analysed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO) and phthalates were determined in the homogenized food samples. ESBO was the principal plasticizer in five of the gaskets; in 14 it was phthalates. ESBO was found in seven of the food samples at concentrations from 6 to 100 mg kg(-1). The highest levels (91-100 mg kg(-1)) were in oily foods such as garlic, chilli or olives in oil. Phthalates, i.e. di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP) and di-iso-nonylphthalates (DINP), were found in seven samples at 6-173 mg kg(-1). The highest concentrations (99-173 mg kg(-1)) were in products of garlic and tomatoes in oil and in fatty food products such as sauce béarnaise and peanut butter. For five of the samples the overall migration from unused lids to the official fatty food simulant olive oil was determined and compared with the legal limit of 60 mg kg(-1). The results ranged from 76 to 519 mg kg(-1) and as a consequence the products were withdrawn from the market.","Food additives & contaminants.

It is shown that the HPLC method provides baseline separation of all these compounds with good resolution values in 40 min. Moreover, other figures of merit of the method show a good linear response and low detection limits for all the compounds considered in the present study. Furthermore, the usefulness of this method is demonstrated via its successful application to the analysis of different beverages from different natural origin (orange, strawberry, apple, peach pineapple, plum and blackcurrant juices, soybean milk, beers) without the need of any previous sample preparation. A good correlation is also found by comparing the total phenol content (measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method) with the sum of total phenolic compounds obtained using the proposed HPLC method.

The tested enzymes were human recombinant 5-lipoxygenase (h5-LO), porcine leukocyte 12-LO, rabbit reticulocyte 15-LO, ovine cyclooxygenases 1/2 (COX1/COX2), and human microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). Potato tuber and soybean lipoxygenases (ptLOX and sLOX, respectively) were studied for comparative purposes. LHA inhibited most of the tested enzymes with the exception of mPGES-1. The LHA inhibitory activity increased as follows: mPGES-1 (no inhibition)<<COX1 = COX2<h5-LO = sLOX = ptLOX<12-LO<<15-LO. The IC(50) values for COX1/COX2, h5-LO, 12-LO, and 15-LO were 60, 7, 0.6, and 0.02 muM, respectively. sLOX was the only tested enzyme that was capable of aerobic oxygenation of LHA, producing 13-hydroperoxy-LHA.

However, the current Adequate Intakes (AI) might not be sufficient for the maintenance of bone health. To obtain a closer estimate of dietary intake of phylloquinone (PK) and menaquinones (MKs), PK, MK-4 and MK-7 contents in food samples (58 food items) were determined by an improved high-performance liquid chromatography method. Next, we assessed dietary vitamin K intake in young women living in eastern Japan using vitamin K contents measured here and the Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan. PK was widely distributed in green vegetables and algae, and high amounts were found in spinach and broccoli (raw, 498 and 307 microg/100 g wet weight, respectively). Although MK-4 was widely distributed in animal products, overall MK-4 content was lower than PK. MK-7 was observed characteristically in fermented soybean products such as natto (939 microg/100 g). The mean total vitamin K intake of all subjects (using data from this study and Japanese food composition tables) was about 230 microg/d and 94% of participants met the AI of vitamin K for women aged 18-29 y in Japan, 60 microg/d. The contributions of PK, MK-4 and MK-7 to total vitamin K intake were 67.7, 7.3 and 24.9%, respectively.

18192686,"The tissue concentrations of the female sex hormone 17beta-estradiol (E2) and its reactive catechol metabolites such as 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-HO-E2) play important roles in hormonal carcinogenesis. They are influenced by the activity of local enzymes involved in the metabolic activation and inactivation of E2. In the mammary gland, catechol estrogens are predominately inactivated by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Food supplements containing the soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein are consumed because they are believed to protect from breast cancer; however, this proposed benefit is controversial. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of soy isoflavones on the gene expression and activity of COMT in cultured human mammary adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells. Levels of COMT messenger RNA (mRNA) were determined by reverse transcription/competitive polymerase chain reaction and COMT activity was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the methylation products of both the model substrate quercetin and the physiological relevant substrate 4-HO-E2. Our study demonstrates for the first time that soy isoflavones at hormonally active concentrations cause a significant reduction of both COMT mRNA levels and COMT activity as well as of the methylation of 4-HO-E2. Experiments using the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780 support a role of the ER in the isoflavone-induced down-regulation of COMT expression. Thus, this study not only demonstrates that hormonally active concentrations of soy isoflavones inhibit the detoxification of catechols in this human breast cancer cell line but also implies that diet might influence COMT activity to a greater extent than heretofore recognized.",Carcinogenesis,"['D001943', 'D002394', 'D045744', 'D049109', 'D004032', 'D004958', 'D002393', 'D005260', 'D000077267', 'D015972', 'D006801', 'D008954', 'D008956', 'D011960', 'D013025']","['Breast Neoplasms', 'Catechol O-Methyltransferase', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Diet', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens, Catechol', 'Female', 'Fulvestrant', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Chemical', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Soybeans']",Soy isoflavones decrease the catechol-O-methyltransferase-mediated inactivation of 4-hydroxyestradiol in cultured MCF-7 cells.,"['Q000188', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000031', 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","['drug therapy', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18192686,2008

To evaluate the potential health risk of AFB1 to Koreans posed by food consumption, we determined the natural occurrence of AFB1 in food and estimated the excess risk for liver cancer through dietary exposure to AFB1. A total of 694 food samples collected from six different regions of South Korea were analyzed for their AFB, content. One hundred four of the 694 samples were found to give positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) readings for AFB1 and were further investigated with high-performance liquid chromatography. Thirty-two samples, including 2 maize samples, 3 soybean products, 20 peanut samples, nut samples, and their products, and 7 spices, were found to be contaminated with AFB1 (4.6% incidence), up to 48.6 microg kg(-1). The level of AFB1 contamination in 28 of the 32 food products was below 10 microg kg(-1), which is the legal tolerance limit in Korea. From data on daily food consumption, the exposure dose of AFB1 was estimated to be 6.42 x 10(-7) mg kg(-1) body weight (bw) day(-1). The major contributors to the dietary intake of AFB1 were soybean paste and soy sauce, which composed 91% of the total exposure to AFB1. The excess risk of liver cancer for those exposed to AFB1 through food intake was estimated to be 5.78 x 10(-6) for hepatitis B-negative individuals and 1.48 x 10(-4) for hepatitis B-positive individuals.

Flour dough containing soy flour at 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% was fried in corn oil at 180 degrees C for 2.5 min, and a total of 60 fryings were performed every 30 min. The oxidation of oil was determined by contents of free fatty acids (FFA), conjugated dienoic acids (CDA), polar compounds, and p-anisidine values (PAV). Tocopherols and phospholipids (PLs) in the oil were determined by HPLC. Tocopherols were present in corn oil at 1000 ppm before frying and increased after the first frying of dough containing soy flour due to tocopherol transfer from soy-flour-added dough to the oil during frying. However, as the oil repeated frying, tocopherol contents decreased and its degradation rate was higher in the oil that fried soy-flour-added dough than in the oil that fried the dough without soy flour. PL was not detected in corn oil before and after frying. As the oil repeated frying, FFA, CDA, and polar compounds contents, and PAV of frying oil increased due to the oil oxidation. The values were higher in the oil which fried soy-flour-added dough than in the oil fried the dough without soy flour, indicating the acceleration of oil oxidation by soy flour added to dough.

17678570,"Soya isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, are the focus of numerous studies investigating their potential effects on health and results remain controversial. Bioavailability is clearly a crucial factor influencing their bioefficacy and could explain these discrepancies. This study aimed at assessing: (1) the isoflavone content of sixty-nine European soya-derivative products sold on the French market; (2) the bioavailability of isoflavones comparing supplement with food. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited in a randomized two-way crossover trial and received 35 mg isoflavones equivalent aglycone either through supplements or through cheese, both containing different patterns of isoflavone conjugates and different daidzein:genistein ratios. A specific ELISA method was used to assess the plasma and urinary concentrations of isoflavones and thus the pharmacokinetic parameters, which were then normalized to mg of each isoflavone ingested. Results showed that the normalized Cmax of daidzein (P = 0.002) and similarly the normalized AUC0 --> infinity and Cmax of genistein (P = 0.002) from soya-based capsules were higher than that from soya-based cheese. In conclusion, this work completes studies on isoflavone bioavailability and presents new data regarding isoflavone concentrations in soya-derivative products. Assuming that isoflavone conjugation patterns do not influence isoflavone bioavailability, this study shows that isoflavones contained in capsules are more bioavailable than those contained in soya-based cheese.

17601809,"Coprophilous and litter-decomposing species (26 strains) of the genus Coprinus were screened for peroxidase activities by using selective agar plate tests and complex media based on soybean meal. Two species, Coprinus radians and C. verticillatus, were found to produce peroxidases, which oxidized aryl alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes at pH 7 (a reaction that is typical for heme-thiolate haloperoxidases). The peroxidase of Coprinus radians was purified to homogeneity and characterized. Three fractions of the enzyme, CrP I, CrP II, and CrP III, with molecular masses of 43 to 45 kDa as well as isoelectric points between 3.8 and 4.2, were identified after purification by anion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography. The optimum pH of the major fraction (CrP II) for the oxidation of aryl alcohols was around 7, and an H2O2 concentration of 0.7 mM was most suitable regarding enzyme activity and stability. The apparent Km values for ABTS [2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid)], 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, benzyl alcohol, veratryl alcohol, and H2O2 were 49, 342, 635, 88, and 1,201 microM, respectively. The N terminus of CrP II showed 29% and 19% sequence identity to Agrocybe aegerita peroxidase (AaP) and chloroperoxidase, respectively. The UV-visible spectrum of CrP II was highly similar to that of resting-state cytochrome P450 enzymes, with the Soret band at 422 nm and additional maxima at 359, 542, and 571 nm. The reduced carbon monoxide complex showed an absorption maximum at 446 nm, which is characteristic of heme-thiolate proteins. CrP brominated phenol to 2- and 4-bromophenols and selectively hydroxylated naphthalene to 1-naphthol. Hence, after AaP, CrP is the second extracellular haloperoxidase-peroxygenase described so far. The ability to extracellularly hydroxylate aromatic compounds seems to be the key catalytic property of CrP and may be of general significance for the biotransformation of poorly available aromatic substances, such as lignin, humus, and organopollutants in soil litter and dung environments.

17598089,"A coprecipitation method using sample constituents as carrier precipitants was developed that can remove molybdenum, which interferes with the determination of cadmium in grain samples via isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-ICPMS). Samples were digested with HNO3, HF, and HClO4, and then purified 6 M sodium hydroxide solution was added to generate colloidal hydrolysis compounds, mainly magnesium hydroxide. Cadmium can be effectively separated from molybdenum because the cadmium forms hydroxides and adsorbs onto and/or is occluded in the colloid, while the molybdenum does not form hydroxides or adsorb onto the hydrolysis colloid. The colloid was separated by centrifugation and then dissolved with 0.2 M HNO3 solution to recover the cadmium. The recovery of Cd achieved using the coprecipitation was >97%, and the removal efficiency of Mo was approximately 99.9%. An extremely low procedural blank (below the detection limit of ICPMS) was achieved by purifying the 6 M sodium hydroxide solution via Mg coprecipitation using Mg(NO3)2 solution. The proposed method was applied to two certified reference materials (NIST SRM 1567a wheat flour and SRM 1568a rice flour) and CCQM-P64 soybean powder.

Recently, however, foods with bioactive substances such as isoflavones have received great attention. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the presence of the isoflavones daidzein, glycitein, genistein and their conjugated forms in grains and leaves of several leguminous plants utilized largely in Brazilian cuisine. Grains used in Peruvian cuisine were also analyzed. After extracting phenolic compounds with methanol (80%), isoflavones as detected by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/ diode-array detector were only found in chickpeas and soybean. Chickpea extracts showed only the isoflavone genistein at 31 microg/g defatted flour. Detection of these isoflavones was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass and tandem mass spectrometric experiments. For soybean, a distinct distribution of isoflavones was found in hypocotyls and cotyledon. The highest concentration of isoflavones found was approximately 5.9 mg/g for hypocotyls, whereas the total concentration of isoflavone was around 0.4 mg/g for the cotyledons (dry matter).

17444213,"The increasing interest in functional and healthy food products has promoted the use of soybean in the manufacture of foods for human consumption. Soybean basic products (soybeans, textured soybean, soybean flour, soybean protein concentrate and soybean protein isolate) as well as soybean derivatives (soybean dairy-like products, soybean drinks with fruits, meat analogues, etc.) are commercially available. In addition, due to the interesting nutritional and functional properties of soybean proteins, they are usually employed as ingredient in the elaboration of a large number of food products such as bakery or meat products among others. In spite of the good characteristics of soybean proteins, their addition to some products is forbidden or allowed up to a certain limit. Therefore, analytical methodologies to achieve the determination of soybean proteins in foods are necessary in order to make possible adequate quality control and to prove that legal regulations controlling their addition are accomplished. However, this is not an easy task due to the diversity and complexity of the food matrices and the technological treatments to which some of these foods are submitted during their elaboration. This article presents for the first time a comprehensive review on the analytical methodologies developed using HPLC and CE to characterize soybeans and to analyse soybean proteins in meals.

16998985,"In microwave popcorn workers, exposure to butter flavorings has been associated with fixed obstructive lung disease resembling bronchiolitis obliterans. Inhalation toxicology studies have shown severe respiratory effects in rats exposed to vapors from a paste butter flavoring, and to diacetyl, a diketone found in most butter flavorings. To gain a better understanding of worker exposures, we assessed diacetyl emissions and airborne dust levels from butter flavorings used by several microwave popcorn manufacturing companies. We heated bulk samples of 40 different butter flavorings (liquids, pastes, and powders) to approximately 50 degrees C and used gas chromatography, with a mass selective detector, to measure the relative abundance of volatile organic compounds emitted. Air sampling was conducted for diacetyl and for total and respirable dust during the mixing of powder, liquid, or paste flavorings with heated soybean oil at a microwave popcorn plant. To further examine the potential for respiratory exposures to powders, we measured dust generated during different simulated methods of manual handling of several powder butter flavorings. Powder flavorings were found to give off much lower diacetyl emissions than pastes or liquids. The mean diacetyl emissions from liquids and pastes were 64 and 26 times larger, respectively, than the mean of diacetyl emissions from powders. The median diacetyl emissions from liquids and pastes were 364 and 72 times larger, respectively, than the median of diacetyl emissions from powders. Fourteen of 16 powders had diacetyl emissions that were lower than the diacetyl emissions from any liquid flavoring and from most paste flavorings.

16995529,"The formation of heterocyclic amines (HAs) in the fumes from frying French fries in soybean oil or lard was studied. A high-pressure liquid chromatography method was used to determine the various HAs in fumes. Results showed that the yields of fumes produced from soybean oil when heated alone for 2 or 4 h were higher than from lard; however, a reversed trend was found when frying French fries in soybean oil and lard. Most fumes from soybean oil and lard while frying French fries were adsorbed onto the condensation apparatus, while the other portions were adsorbed onto the wool and glass beads, which were incorporated in our experimental design for collecting the fumes. The fumes from soybean oil when heated alone were found to contain three HAs, namely, 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (IQx), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f ]quinoline (IQ), and 1-methyl-9H-pyrido[4,3-b ]indole (Harman), whereas two more HAs, 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) and 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b ]indole (Trp-P-1), were generated in lard.

16684499,"Soybeans are a rich source of protein and a key feed ingredient in livestock production, but lack sufficient levels of cysteine and methionine to meet the nutritional demands of swine or poultry as feed components. Although engineering the sulfur assimilatory pathway could lead to increased sulfur-containing amino acid content, little is known about this pathway in legumes. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of soybean ATP sulfurylase (ATPS), which acts as the metabolic entry point into the sulfur assimilation pathway. Analysis of the ATPS clone isolated from a soybean seedling cDNA library revealed an open-reading frame, encoding a 52 kDa polypeptide with an N-terminal chloroplast/plastid transit peptide, which was related to the enzymes from Arabidopsis, potato, human, and yeast. Soybean ATP sulfurylase was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. Based on gel-filtration chromatography, the enzyme functions as a 100 kDa homodimer. Analysis of genomic DNA by Southern blotting revealed that multiple genes encode ATP sulfurylase in soybean. Analysis of the transcript profiles retrieved from a soybean EST database indicated that ATP sulfurylase mRNA was most abundant in root tissue. Cold treatment induced mRNA accumulation and enhanced the specific activity of ATP sulfurylase in root tissue. Northern blot analysis indicated a decline in the ATP sulfurylase transcript levels during seed development. Likewise, ATP sulfurylase specific activity also declined in the later stages of seed development. Increasing the expression levels of this key enzyme during soybean seed development could lead to an increase in the availability of sulfur amino acids, thereby enhancing the nutritional value of the crop.",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,"['D002736', 'D003001', 'D003080', 'D018076', 'D019281', 'D004926', 'D018507', 'D015971', 'D018506', 'D005810', 'D010940', 'D018517', 'D020836', 'D012333', 'D036226', 'D012639', 'D013025', 'D013430', 'D013455', 'D014158']","['Chloroplasts', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cold Temperature', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dimerization', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Multigene Family', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Seedlings', 'Seeds', 'Soybeans', 'Sulfate Adenylyltransferase', 'Sulfur', 'Transcription, Genetic']","Soybean ATP sulfurylase, a homodimeric enzyme involved in sulfur assimilation, is abundantly expressed in roots and induced by cold treatment.","['Q000201', None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000502', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000196', None, 'Q000096', 'Q000201', 'Q000201', 'Q000196', 'Q000096', 'Q000378', 'Q000502']","['enzymology', None, None, 'genetics', None, 'genetics', 'physiology', 'physiology', 'physiology', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'embryology', None, 'biosynthesis', 'enzymology', 'enzymology', 'embryology', 'biosynthesis', 'metabolism', 'physiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16684499,2006

16245725,"A strategy for rapid in situ elimination of interfering substances that are present in extracts of food samples during assay is described in this article. The novel feature of this method is that the sample purification is carried out as a part of the assay, and a separate sample cleanup step is not required. The assay procedure involves the sequential addition of standard or sample, cleaning solutions, and aflatoxin B1-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (AFB1-HRP) over antibody-spotted zones of a membrane, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate for visualization. We have determined that trifluoroacetic acid and propionic acids at concentrations of 100 mM are highly effective for cleaning groundnut, wheat, corn, and poultry feed samples and that NaHCO3 (100 mM) is successful in cleaning processed soybean. In all cases, subsequent washing was performed with phosphate-buffered saline solution to facilitate the removal of traces of adhering interfering substances. A batch of 12 samples can be analyzed within 8 min either by visual comparison of the color intensity (inversely related to the analyte concentration) of a sample spot with those of reference standards or, more precisely, by densitometry. The method was tested for the analysis of AFB1 in groundnut, wheat, corn, processed soybean, chili, and poultry feed. The detection limit obtained was 5 microg/kg, except for chili, where it was 10 microg/kg. The average recoveries from different noninfected food samples spiked with AFB1 at concentrations of 5 to 100 microg/kg were between 99 and 105%. The values obtained for infected corn and groundnut samples correlated well with the estimates obtained by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The absence of a sample extraction step reduces the cost and labor involved in the assay.

16230711,"Eight ruminally cannulated lactating cows from a study on the effects of dietary rumen degraded protein (RDP) on production and N metabolism were used to compare 15N, total purines, amino acid (AA) profiles, and urinary excretion of purine derivatives (PD) as microbial markers for quantifying the flow of microbial protein at the omasal canal. Dietary RDP was gradually decreased by replacing solvent soybean meal and urea with lignosulfonate-treated soybean meal. The purine metabolites xanthine and hypoxanthine were present in digesta and microbial samples and were assumed to be of microbial origin. The sum of the purines and their metabolites (adenine, guanine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine) were defined as total purines (TP) and used as a microbial marker. Decreasing dietary RDP from 13.2 to 10.6% of dry matter (DM) reduced microbial nonammonia N (NAN) flows estimated using TP (from 415 to 369 g/d), 15N (from 470 to 384 g/d), AA profiles (from 392 to 311 g/d), and PD (from 436 to 271 g/d). Averaged across diets, microbial NAN flows were highest when estimated using TP and 15N (398 and 429 g/d), lowest when using PD (305 g/d), and intermediate when using AA profiles (360 g/d) as microbial markers. Correlation coefficients between 15N and TP for fluid-associated bacteria, particle-associated bacteria, and total microbial NAN flows were 0.38, 0.85, and 0.69, respectively. When TP was used as the microbial marker, ruminal escape of dietary NAN was not affected by replacing solvent soybean meal with lignosulfonate-treated soybean meal in the diets. The direction and extent of response of dietary and microbial NAN flow to dietary treatments were similar when estimated using 15N, AA profiles, and PD, and were in agreement with previously published data and National Research Council predictions.

We examined the effect of soya foods on circulating IGF-1 and IGF binding protein (BP)-3 levels among 196 healthy premenopausal women in a 2-year randomised nutritional trial. The intervention group consumed two daily servings of soya foods including tofu, soya milk, soya nuts and soya protein powder (equivalent to 50 mg isoflavones and 5-22 g soya protein per serving); the controls maintained their regular diet. Five serum samples at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were collected in the morning during the luteal phase and analysed for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 by double-antibody ELISA. We applied mixed models to investigate the intervention effect and predictors of serum levels while considering the repeated measurement design. Adherence with the study regimen was high and dropout rates were acceptable. Randomisation resulted in similar mean IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels by group. We did not observe a significant intervention effect on IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and their molar ratio during the entire study period. However, urinary isoflavone excretion during the study period was positively associated with IGF-1 (P=0.04) and the IGF-1:IGFBP-3 ratio (P=0.06). The effect was consistent over time.

For quantitation of CoQ10 in food samples, 2 liquid chromatography (LC) methods with UV and mass spectrometry (MS) detections were developed. LC with UV detection was performed at 25 degrees C on a Hyperclone ODS 5 microm 150 x 4.6 mm column with mobile phase consisting of methanol-ethanol-2-propanol (70 + 15 + 15, v/v/v). Flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Retention time of CoQ10 was 10.9 +/- 0.1 min. The method was sensitive [limit of detection (LOD) = 0.2 mg/kg], reproducible [relative standard deviation (RSD) = 3:0%), and linear up to 25 mg/kg (R > 0.999). LC/MS analysis was performed on a LUNA C18 3 microm, 150 x 4.6 mm column, using mobile phase consisting of ethanol-dioxane-acetic acid (9 + 1 + 0.01, v/v/v), flow rate was 0.6 mL/min, and the retention time of CoQ10 was 4.1 +/- 0.1 min. Identification and quantitation were performed with a Finnigan-LCQ mass detector in positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode. Mass spectra were obtained in selected-ion monitoring mode; molecular mass (M+H)+ m/z 863.4 +/- 1 was used for quantitative determination. MS detection is more sensitive than UV detection (LOD = 0.1 mg/kg), less reproducible (RSD = 4.0%), and linear in selected range.

16027206,"Heavy metals such as zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) are potential bioaccumulative toxins of the dairy production system. The heavy metal content of dairy feeds, however, remains poorly documented, particularly in the United States. This survey determined the heavy metal content of 203 typical dairy ration components sampled from 54 dairy farms in Wisconsin. Lowest heavy metal concentrations were found in homegrown alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay and haylage, and corn (Zea mays L.) grain and silage. Highest metal concentrations were found in purchased feeds, particularly mineral supplements, and to a lesser extent corn- or soybean-based concentrates. Zinc and Cu were found at the highest concentration in complete dairy (total mixed and aggregated component) rations and reflected the deliberate addition of these metals to meet animal nutrient requirements although more than half the farms fed Cu and Zn above US recommended levels. Concentrations of Cr, As, Cd, and Pb were present in much lower concentrations and decreased in the order Cr > As > Pb > Cd. No complete Wisconsin dairy ration contained heavy metal concentrations above US maximum acceptable concentrations and would be unlikely to induce any toxic effects in dairy cattle. Concentrations of Cd in complete dairy rations were closest to US maximum acceptable concentrations, suggesting the greatest potential long-term risk to exceed US maximum acceptable concentrations if whole farm levels of Cd were to increase in the future. With the exception of Pb, the main sources of Zn, Cu, Cr, As, and Cd in the complete dairy feed ration originated from imported feed. The continued importation of heavy metals in dairy feed is likely to be associated with accumulation of these metals in soils where manure is applied. Although the cycling of many heavy metals through the dairy food chain will be limited by factors such as a soil's cation exchange capacity, pH, salinity, and phytotoxicity of the metal, these may be less limiting for Cd. It is important that sources of Cd in the dairy system are identified and minimized to prevent problems associated with Cd accumulation in the dairy soil system arising over the long-term.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000821', 'D000818', 'D001151', 'D002104', 'D002417', 'D002857', 'D003300', 'D003612', 'D004032', 'D005260', 'D007774', 'D007854', 'D013058', 'D000455', 'D019216', 'D012820', 'D013053', 'D014922', 'D003313', 'D015032']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Cadmium', 'Cattle', 'Chromium', 'Copper', 'Dairying', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Lactation', 'Lead', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Medicago sativa', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Silage', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Wisconsin', 'Zea mays', 'Zinc']",A survey of selected heavy metal concentrations in Wisconsin dairy feeds.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16027206,2006

Dilution of the methanol extract before SBSE was optimized to obtain high sensitivity and to minimize adsorption onto the glass wall of the extraction vessel as well as to minimize sample matrix effects (particularly for the pesticides with high log K(o,w) values). The optimized method consists of a dual SBSE extraction performed simultaneously on respectively a twofold and a fivefold diluted methanol extract.

15913016,"A major, often unrecognized variable regulating plant growth in semi-closed environment is air contaminant. The vapor of propylene glycol (PG), which was used as coolant in growth chambers, has been found to be toxic to corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) plants. PG solution leaked from a valve packing system and volatilized to vapor, which was trapped in a semi-closed growth chamber. Symptoms of leaf edge chlorosis, later developing into necrosis, were observed on the third day of emergence or on the third day after moving healthy plants into the chamber. For young soybean plants, symptoms were slightly different from those observed in corn plants; the chlorosis symptoms were not uniformly distributed on all leaves. Some soybean leaves curled up and others had white spots. This problem was identified by using a portable photoionization detector to obtain instantaneous readings of total volatile organic compound concentrations inside the chambers. The presence of PG in selected chambers was verified using sample collection with solid phase microextraction (SPME) followed by analysis with multi-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry (MD-GC-MS).

The potential effects of genistein on the sensory and chemical quality of fish muscle may affect the full utilization of soybean meal as an alternative protein in aquaculture diets. Fingerling trout fed commercial diets containing 0, 500, 1000, or 3000 ppm pure genistein were analyzed after 6 and 12 months of feeding. Genistein was extracted by enzymatic digestions in Tris buffer and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Moisture, fat, protein, ash, and tristimulus color of the fillets were determined. The extent of lipid oxidation occurring in fillets harvested after 12 months of feeding was studied by measurements of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) after 4 and 8 days of refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C. Triangle tests were performed to determine if there were any detectable sensory differences. A dietary genistein content of 3000 ppm led to the deposition of approximately 5.4 pmol of genistein/mg of fillet.

No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, genistein and biochanin A.

Six food categories including legumes, cereals, tubers, vegetables, fruits, and mushrooms and 17 total items were tested. An extraction procedure was designed to prepare food cold-water soluble, hot-water soluble, cold-alkaline soluble, and hot-alkaline soluble fractions. A fluorescence microassay based on aniline blue dye, which bound specifically to 1,3-beta-G, was developed to measure its content in the food fractions. Curdlan was used as standard to construct the 1,3-beta-G calibration curve, and a linear correlation within a 14 microg/mL concentration range was obtained. This microassay displayed selectivities among various 1,3-beta-G species. Biologically active ones such as pachyman and yeast glucan possessed much stronger fluorescent signals than others such as laminarin and barley glucan. Possible fluorescent interference from food proteins was estimated. This assay tolerated up to 50% of bovine serum albumin in 10 microg/mL curdlan. Analysis of the four food fractions showed that besides the well-known lentinan-containing shiitake, popular foods such as celery, chin-chian leaves, carrot, and radish contained nearly 20% 1,3-beta-G in their total sugar. Soybean dry weight contained 0.8% 1,3-beta-G, which was twice the amount compared to shiitake. Snow mushroom dry weight had the highest 1,3-beta-G content, at 2.5%, and was rich in both water (0.67%) and alkaline soluble (1.87%) forms.

15135153,"Clinical studies have demonstrated that consumption of phytosterol esters in lipid-based foods decreases serum concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol. These substances represent minimal potential for adverse effects when consumed orally because of their low bioavailability. However, some studies have reported estrogenic and other effects in laboratory animals treated parenterally with phytosterols, demonstrating that these substances may have the potential to cause adverse effects if absorbed. Water-soluble phytosterols have been prepared by formulation with emulsifiers to expand delivery options to include non-lipid-based foods. However, emulsifiers are used as excipients in the formulation of lipophilic pharmaceuticals to increase solubility, thereby increasing their absorption. Therefore, oral consumption of emulsified water-soluble phytosterols could potentially increase their absorption. In the current study, absorption of phytosterols prepared as water-soluble emulsified micelles with two different food-grade emulsifiers was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats and compared with absorption of non-micellar free phytosterols and esterified phytosterol mixtures dissolved in a lipophilic vehicle (soybean oil). Rats were dosed via gavage with 42 mg/kg of formulated phytosterol preparations. Blood was collected at 8, 16, 24, and 32 hours, extracted with hexane, derivatized with benzoyl chloride, and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to determine concentrations of beta-sitosterol, and campesterol. Plasma concentrations and AUC(0-32 hours) [microg/mL/h] of beta-sitosterol and campesterol were lower in plasma obtained from rats treated with emulsified phytosterol preparations than in animals treated with free phytosterols dissolved in soybean oil.

This oil (CE) showed light yellow color and the peroxide value was less than 1.0 meq/kg. The main lipid class of CE was triacylglycerol (TG) (>99%). These features indicate that CE can be directly used as food materials without further purification. Commercial sardine oil (CO) is usually prepared via some kind of refining process with high temperature (250 degrees C) and chemical treatment. The comparative study on the physiological effects of these sardine oils (CE and CO) revealed that the dietary sardine oils were more effective in reducing abdominal fat pads, plasma total cholesterol, and TG levels of rats than was a soybean oil diet (control). Furthermore, these effects were greater in CE than CO, although there was little difference in the fatty acid composition of both oils. Although the main lipid class of CE was TG (>99%), CE was prepared by centrifugation from surimi waste and directly used as dietary fat without further purification. Therefore, CE may contain some kinds of minor components, which could be attributed to the higher physiological activity of CE.

The inverse correlation between the two lipid groups suggests that the decrease in ox-TG during refining was due in part to the occurrence of polymerization reactions. An inverse correlation was also found between the percentage sum of ox-TG + TGP and percent TGP, indicating that a part of the ox-TG also underwent degradation or transformation reactions. On average, almost 58% of the ox-TG remained unchanged during refining and, of the rest, about half was involved in polymerization reactions and half in degradation or transformation reactions.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D003314', 'D005511', 'D010084', 'D000074241', 'D010938', 'D011108', 'D012639', 'D013024', 'D000074242', 'D014280']","['Corn Oil', 'Food Handling', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peanut Oil', 'Plant Oils', 'Polymers', 'Seeds', 'Soybean Oil', 'Sunflower Oil', 'Triglycerides']",Fate of oxidized triglycerides during refining of seed oils.,"['Q000737', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","['chemistry', 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14705891,2005

A cysteine protease, used extensively in the food industry, was purified from germinated wheat Triticum aestivum (cv. Giza 164) grains through a simple reproducible method consisting of extraction, ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 61000+/-1200-62000+/-1500 by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration. The cysteine protease had an isoelectric point and pH optimum at 4.4 and 4.0, respectively. The enzyme exhibited more activity toward azocasein than the other examined substrates with K(m) 2.8+/-0.15 mg azocasein/ml. In addition, it had a temperature optimum of 50 degrees C and based on a heat stability study 55% of its initial activity remained after preincubation of the enzyme at 50 degrees C for 30 min prior to substrate addition. All the examined metal cations inhibited the enzyme except Co(2+), Mg(2+), Mn(2+) and Li(+). The proteolytic activity of the enzyme was inhibited by thiol-specific inhibitors, whereas iodoacetate and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate caused a competitive inhibition with Ki values 6+/-0.3 mM and 21+/-1.2 microM, respectively.

The ratio of triacylglycerol positional isomers containing two linoleic acid (18:2) and one oleic acid (18:1) moieties--namely, 1(3),2-dilinoleoyl-3(1)-oleoyl glycerol (LLO) and 1,3-dilinoleoyl-2-oleoyl glycerol (LOL)--were quantified in grape seed, olive, pumpkin seed, soybean, sunflower and wheat germ oils by high-performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC/APCI-MS) in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Relative LOL contents (LOL/(LLO+LOL)) of the oils were calculated from the mass abundances of the [LL]+ and [LO]+ diacylglycerol fragment ions ([M+H-RCOOH]+) using a calibration curve. The calibration curve of the relative diacylglycerol mass abundances was measured in SIM mode. The relative LOL contents were found to be relatively consistent for each oil variety.

The nitrate () and nitrite () contents of various vegetables (Chinese cabbage, radish, lettuce, spinach, soybean sprouts, onion, pumpkin, green onion, cucumber, potato, carrot, garlic, green pepper, cabbage and Allium tuberosum Roth known as Crown daisy) are reported. Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables. The average nitrite contents in various vegetables were about 0.6 mg kg(-1), and the values were not significantly different among most vegetables. It was observed that nitrate contents in vegetables varied depending on the type of vegetables and were similar to those in vegetables grown in other countries. From the results of our studies and other information from foreign sources, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to establish limits of nitrates contents of vegetables cultivated in Korea due to the co-presence of beneficial elements such as ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol which are known to inhibit the formation of nitrosamine.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000490', 'D001530', 'D001937', 'D002212', 'D002852', 'D004032', 'D006801', 'D007391', 'D007723', 'D009566', 'D009573', 'D019697', 'D031224', 'D012621', 'D013025', 'D013056', 'D006113', 'D014675']","['Allium', 'Belgium', 'Brassica', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Diet', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Korea', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrites', 'Onions', 'Raphanus', 'Seasons', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'United Kingdom', 'Vegetables']",Survey of nitrate and nitrite contents of vegetables grown in Korea.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'adverse effects', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12888387,2003

To validate this, total and individual isoflavone compositions were determined by HPLC for two different soy protein isolates used in the commercial manufacture of soy foods over a 3-year period (n = 30/isolate) and 85 samples of 40 different brands of soy milks. Total isoflavone concentrations differed markedly between the soy protein isolates, varying by 200-300% over 3 years, whereas the protein content varied by only 3%. Total isoflavone content varied by up to 5-fold among different commercial soy milks and was not consistent between repeat purchases.

12769739,"There are many examples of biologically active food proteins, with physiological significance beyond the pure nutritional requirements that concern available nitrogen for normal growth and maintenance. Moreover, there are many physiologically active peptides, derived by protease activity from various food protein sources; however, relationships between structural properties and functional activities have not been completely elucidated. Many bioactive peptides have in common structural properties that include a relatively short peptide residue length (e.g. 2-9 amino acids), possessing hydrophobic amino acid residues in addition to proline, lysine or arginine groups. Bioactive peptides are also resistant to the action of digestion peptidases. Antihypertensive peptides, known as Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been derived from milk, corn and fish protein sources. Peptides with opioid activities are derived from wheat gluten or casein, following digestion with pepsin. Exorphins, or opioid peptides derived from food proteins such as wheat and milk (e.g. exogenous sources) have similar structure to endogenous opioid peptides, with a tyrosine residue located at the amino terminal or bioactive site. Immunomodulatory peptides derived from tryptic hydrolysates of rice and soybean proteins act to stimulate superoxide anions (reactive oxygen species-ROS), which triggers non-specific immune defense systems. Antioxidant properties that prevent peroxidation of essential fatty acids have also been shown for peptides derived from milk proteins. The addition of a Leu or Pro residue to the N-terminus of a His-His, dipeptide will enhance antioxidant activity and facilitate further synergy with non-peptide antioxidants (e.g. BHT). We also show herein, that the tryptic digests of casein yielding caseinophosphopeptides exhibits both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity due to both metal ion sequestering and quenching of ROS. The separation and purification of bioactive peptides which will involve development of automated and continuous systems is an important field for Food chemists. Much effort has been given to develop selective column chromatography methods that can replace batch methods of salting out, or using solvent extraction to isolate and purify bioactive peptides.

Cows were fed total mixed rations containing (dry matter basis) 44% corn silage, 22% alfalfa silage, 2% urea, and 31% concentrate. The basal diet contained 31% high-moisture corn; equal N from one of four protein supplements was added to the other diets at the expense of corn: 9% solvent soybean meal (SSBM), 10% expeller soybean meal (ESBM), 5.5% blood meal (BM), and 7% corn gluten meal (CGM). Omasal sampling was used to quantify total AA N (TAAN) and nonammonia N (NAN) flows from the rumen. Estimates of RUP were made from differences between total and microbial N flows, including a correction for RUP in the basal diet. Modifying a spectrophotometric assay improved total purine recovery from isolated bacteria and omasal samples and gave estimates of microbial TAAN and NAN flows that were similar to a standard HPLC method. Linear programming, based on AA patterns of the diet and isolated omasal bacteria and ruminal protozoa, appeared to overestimate microbial TAAN and NAN flows compared to the purine assays. Yields of microbial TAAN and NAN determined using any method was not affected by diet and averaged 32 to 35 g NAN per kilogram of organic matter truly digested in the rumen.

These foods were chosen for their relevance in human and animal nutrition and prepared as they are usually eaten by humans. As confirmed by further investigations the precaecal digestibility is a valuable measure for determining the availability of native B-vitamins. Therefore, pigs were fitted with an end-to-end ileo-rectal anastomosis for digesta passing straight from ileum to rectum, thus avoiding endogenous vitamin synthesis by the colon. Three weeks after surgery the digestibility experiments were carried out during which the animals were fed various experimental diets for a period of 12 days and digesta were collected quantitatively twice a day during the final 5 days of this period. The concentration of vitamin B6 in foods and chyme was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography.

11911490,"Epidemiological studies have indicated that the exposure to carcinogenic components formed during the cooking of food might be associated with lung cancer risk of Chinese women. Previous studies have confirmed that cooking oil fumes from frying fish (COF) contained relatively high amount of benzo[a]pyrene, 2-methyl-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f] qunoxaline, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene, reported in fumes from heated soybean oil. Thus, we consider that oxidative stress induced by COF may play a role in lung cancer development among Chinese women. To verify whether the oxidative DNA damage was induced by COF, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis data showed that the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine (8-OH dG) were increased in a dose-dependent manner when calf thymus DNA reacted with various concentrations of COF. Since human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) was a repair enzyme for removing 8- OH dG from damaged DNA, we hypothesized that hOGG1 mRNA may be used to assess the risk of oxidative damage induced by the exposure of COF. The results from reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the hOGG1 mRNA expression was induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and COF in human lung adenocarcinoma CL-3 cells. To elucidate whether hOGG1 mRNA expression was an exposure biomarker of COF, a cross-sectional study of 238 subjects including 94 professional cooks, 43 housewives, and 101 COF-nonexposed control subjects was conducted. The hOGG1 mRNA expression frequencies of COF-exposed cooks (27 of 94, 28.7%) and housewives (6 of 43, 14%) were significantly higher than those of control subjects (4 of 101, 4%). After adjusting for age, sex, and smoking and drinking status, the odds risks (ORs) of housewives versus control and cooks versus control were 3.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95-16.62) and 10.12 (95% CI = 2.83-36.15), respectively. These results indicated that hOGG1 may be adequate to act as an exposure biomarker to assess the oxidative DNA damage induced by COF.

11836067,"Phytoestrogens, plant-derived nonsteroidal estrogens found in high abundance in most soy food products, have been studied for their potential beneficial effects against hormone-dependent cancers and age-related diseases. However, little is known about the influence of phytoestrogens on the brain or behavior. This brief review describes mainly our own studies in rodents that have examined the influence of dietary soy isoflavones on certain aspects of brain structure, learning, memory and anxiety along with the brain androgen-metabolizing enzyme, aromatase. These studies used a commercially available diet rich in phytoestrogens (Phyto-rich) vs. a custom diet relatively free of phytoestrogens (Phyto-free). The phytoestrogen content of each diet was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, circulating plasma phytoestrogen levels were quantified by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy and concentrations of phytoestrogens in specific brain regions were measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA). Our studies showed that brain aromatase levels were not significantly altered by phytoestrogen diet treatments in perinatal, maternal or adult rats. However, volumes of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) were significantly affected by the Phyto-free diet treatment in male rats during adulthood, where SDN-POA volumes were smaller compared to Phyto-rich male values. Additionally, the Phyto-rich diet fed to adult male and female rats produced anxiolytic effects as assessed in the elevated plus maze vs. Phyto-free fed animals. Finally, when learning and memory parameters were examined in a radial arm maze testing visual-spatial memory (VSM), the diet treatments significantly changed the typical sexually dimorphic pattern of VSM. Specifically, adult Phyto-rich fed females outperformed Phyto-free fed females, while in males on the same diets, the opposite pattern of maze performance was observed. When female vs. male performance was compared, Phyto-rich females executed the VSM task in a manner similar to that of Phyto-free fed males, while Phyto-free fed female's VSM was comparable to Phyto-rich males. These results indicate that consumption of dietary phytoestrogens resulting in very high plasma isoflavone levels (in many cases over a relatively short interval of consumption in adulthood) can significantly alter sexually dimorphic brain regions, anxiety, learning and memory. The findings of these studies identify the biological actions of phytoestrogens, specifically isoflavones and their metabolites, found in animal soy-containing diets on brain and behavior and implicate the importance of phytoestrogens given the recognized significance of estrogens in brain and neural disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, especially in women.",Neurotoxicology and teratology,"['D000818', 'D001522', 'D001921', 'D004968', 'D005260', 'D007529', 'D008297', 'D048789', 'D028321', 'D051381', 'D020318', 'D017207', 'D013025']","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain', 'Estrogens, Non-Steroidal', 'Female', 'Isoflavones', 'Male', 'Phytoestrogens', 'Plant Preparations', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Soybeans']",Neurobehavioral effects of dietary soy phytoestrogens.,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000494', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11836067,2002
11822903,"Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) is a widely used technique for bioseparation of proteins in general and recombinant proteins with polyhistidine fusion tags in particular. An expensive and critical step in this process is coupling of a chelating ligand to the chromatographic matrix. This chelating ligand coordinates metal ions such as Cu(2+), Zn(2+), and Ni(2+), which in turn bind proteins. The toxicity of chemicals required for coupling and their slow release during the separation process are of considerable concern. This is an important issue in the context of purification of proteins/enzymes which are used in food processing or pharmaceutical purposes. In this work, a simpler IMAC design is described which should lead to a paradigm shift in the application of IMAC in separation. It is shown that zinc alginate beads (formed by chelating alginate with Zn(2+) directly) can be used for IMAC. As ""proof of concept"", soybean trypsin inhibitor was purified 18-fold from its crude extract with 90% recovery of biological activity.

Most of these toxins were also isolated from M. verrucaria spores and mycelia grown on potato dextrose agar medium, including epiroridin E (32.3 mg/g), epiisororidin E (28.6 mg/g), roridin E (0 mg/g), roridin H (60 mg/g), trichoverrin A (1.3 mg/g), trichoverrin B (1.8 mg/g), verrucarin A (13.8 mg/g), and verrucarin J (131 mg/g).

Purified macrocyclic trichothecenes (verrucarin A and T-2 toxin) were very cytotoxic to the same cell lines (< or = 2 ng/ml). These results show that neither intact macrocyclic trichothecenes nor toxic metabolites could be detected in plant tissues after treatment with M. verrucaria spores.

11524239,"Nutritional factors, especially phytoestrogens, have been extensively studied for their potential beneficial effects against hormone-dependent and age-related diseases. The present study describes the short-term effects of dietary phytoestrogens on regulatory behaviors (food/water intake, locomotor activity and body weight), prostate weight, prostate 5alpha-reductase enzyme activity, reproductive hormone levels, and testicular steroidogenic acute regulatory peptide (StAR) levels in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were fed either a phytoestrogen-rich diet containing approximately 600 microg/g isoflavones (as determined by HPLC) or a phytoestrogen-free diet. After 5 weeks of consuming these diets, plasma phytoestrogen levels were 35 times higher in animals fed the phytoestrogen-rich vs phytoestrogen-free diets. Body and prostate weights were significantly decreased in animals fed the phytoestrogen-rich diet vs the phytoestrogen-free fed animals; however, no significant change in prostate 5alpha-reductase enzyme activity was observed between the treatment groups. Locomotor activity levels were higher in the phytoestrogen-rich vs the phytoestrogen-free animals during the course of the treatment interval. Plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels were significantly lower in the animals fed the phytoestrogen-rich diet compared with animals fed the phytoestrogen-free diet. However, there were no significant differences in plasma LH or estradiol levels between the diet groups. Testicular StAR levels were not significantly different between the phytoestrogen-rich vs the phytoestrogen-free fed animals. These results indicated that consumption of dietary phytoestrogens resulting in very high plasma isoflavone levels over a relatively short period can significantly alter body and prostate weight and plasma androgen hormone levels without affecting gonadotropin or testicular StAR levels.

We developed a microplate method to measure genomic DNA damage in Chinese hamster ovary cells with a modified single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay. This allowed us to measure the repression of 2-acetoxyacetylaminofluorene (2AAAF)-induced DNA damage by very small amounts of complex mixtures, fractions or individual chemicals isolated from agricultural by-products. We previously demonstrated that PCC, an ethanol extract of a commercial soybean processing by-product, repressed induced genomic DNA damage in mammalian cells. PCC was separated into a series of chemically defined fractions and two fractions (PCC70 and PCC100) repressed mutagen-induced damage. Of the isoflavones isolated from soybean fraction PCC70, daidzein expressed antigenotoxic activity, however, genistin and genistein enhanced DNA damage. An antigenotoxic response also was observed with a fraction isolated from corn distillate solids (CDS40). We developed a microplate assay to measure the suppression of the growth rate of human cancer cells in which the cytostatic/cytotoxic status at each concentration of the test sample was quantitatively determined. Genistein, genistin, daidzein and daidzin isolated from soybean fraction PCC70 expressed a wide range of growth suppression of HT-29 human colon cancer cells.

Here we report a simple and reliable method for processing milligram quantities of dried plant material for the analysis of the carbon isotope composition of lipids, soluble sugars, starch and cellulose from the same sample. We evaluated three different starch preparation methods, namely (1) enzymatic hydrolysis by alpha-amylase, (2) solubilization by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) followed by precipitation with ethanol, and (3) partial hydrolysis by HCl followed by precipitation of the resulting dextrins by ethanol. Starch recovery for three commercially available native starches (from potato, rice and wheat) varied from 48 to 81% for the techniques based on precipitation, whereas the enzymatic technique exhibited yields between 99 and 105%. In addition, the DMSO and HCl techniques introduced a significant (13)C fractionation of up to 1.9 per thousand, while the carbon isotope composition of native starches analyzed after enzymatic digestion did not show any significant difference from that of untreated samples. The enzymatic starch preparation method was then incorporated into a protocol for determination of delta(13)C signatures of lipids, soluble carbohydrates, starch and crude cellulose. The procedure is based on methanol/chloroform/water extraction of dried and ground leaf material. After recovery of the chloroform phase (lipid fraction), the methanol/water phase was deionized by ion exchange (soluble carbohydrate fraction) and the pellet treated with heat-stable alpha-amylase (starch fraction). The remaining insoluble material was subjected to solvolysis by diglyme (cellulose fraction).

The levels of ferritin mRNA were similar in the vegetative tissues of both species, but ferritin protein levels were higher in rice. Both ferritin mRNA and protein levels were lower in wheat and rice seeds. ICAP spectrometry showed that iron levels increased only in vegetative tissues of transgenic plants, and not in the seeds.

These products are based on proteins, which have been heat-treated and hydrolyzed to a different degree in order to cleave antibody-binding structures. Even extensively hydrolyzed products have occasionally been observed to elicit allergic reactions in sensitized infants, however. Therefore, the parameters of relevance to allergenic potential require more investigation. The objective of the present study was to investigate 12 different hydrolyzed milk formulas for their contents of potentially allergenic protein material, i.e. material that may induce allergenicity or elicit allergic responses in already sensitized individuals. Analytical methods applied were gel filtration, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), native PAGE, immunoblotting, dot-immunobinding, and ELISA. Care was taken to assure that all protein fractions were investigated, including supernatants and precipitates following centrifugation of the milk formulas. By gel filtration, protein material with apparent molecular masses of 7 to >30 kDa was detected. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of formula precipitates showed that proteins with a molecular mass above 20 kDa were present even in some of the extensively hydrolyzed formulas. Residual antigenic beta-lactoglobulin was found by ELISA in all products. By immunoblotting and dot-immunobinding with antibodies against total whey, caseins, or Kunitz soybean trypsin inhibitor, we observed antigenic material mainly in partially hydrolyzed products.

Ethyl carbamate in commercial samples of kimchi, soy sauce, vinegar, soybean paste, and alcoholic beverages were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/selective ion monitoring (GC-MS/SIM). Homemade soy sauce and kimchi were also analysed. The maximum ethyl carbamate concentrations observed were 73 micrograms/kg in soy sauce, 7.9 micrograms/kg in soybean paste, 2.5 micrograms/l in vinegar, 16.2 micrograms/kg in kimchi and 15.4 mu/l in Korean traditional alcoholic beverages. Combining these values with the average daily food intake data, we estimated that the maximum daily exposure of Korean population to ethyl carbamate is 2.8 micrograms/day, which is not a negligible amount considering the 'virtually safe dose' derived by animal experiment ranges between 1.2 and 4.8 micrograms/day.

This study characterized the molecular species of GluCer from soybean and wheat by low-resolution, high-resolution and tandem mass spectrometry. Soybean GluCer was comprised primarily (>95%) of ceramide with 4,8-sphingadiene (d18:2(delta4,delta8)) and alpha-hydroxypalmitic acid (h16:0); the remainder had the same backbone with h18:0, h20:0, h22:0 and h24:0 fatty acids.

These backbones differ from those of mammalian sphingolipids, which often have a delta4-double bond (but rarely a delta8-double bond), and have alpha-hydroxy fatty acids in only some cases. Previously unexplained fragmentations that were diagnostic for the type of sphingoid base backbone (i.e. by homolytic cleavage of the doubly allylic C-6-C-7 bond to yield a stable distonic allylic radical cation and an allylic radical neutral) were also identified.

Forty-eight cows were blocked and randomly assigned within a block to one of four diets: 1) 21% forage NDF with corn 2) 16% forage NDF with corn, 3) 16% forage NDF with corn and wheat (1:1) and, 4) 11% forage NDF with cottonseed and corn. Soybean hulls were added at approximately 23.0% of dry matter (DM) for the 16 and 11% forage NDF diets to replace forage and formulate diets with 35% nonfiber carbohydrates. Actual forage NDF concentration were 17.8, 14.0, 13.9, and 9.4%, respectively. Dry matter intake and milk yield were highest for cows fed 11% forage NDF with cottonseed. Milk fat percentage was higher for cows consuming 21% forage NDF and 16% forage NDF with corn than for cows fed the two other diets. Cows fed 16% forage NDF with corn and wheat experienced milk fat-protein inversion, but ruminal acetate:propionate was lower for cows fed 11% forage NDF than cows fed 16% forage NDF. Body weight (BW) and BW change were not different among treatments. Time spent chewing was similar among all diets. For cows in midlactation, forage NDF may be reduced to 9 to 11% when cottonseed is at 11% of DM and dietary nonstructural carbohydrates are at 30% of DM.

The total Cd intake from feed was calculated. Feed mixtures and components, straw and kidney cortex samples, and certified reference samples were microwave-digested and analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry with graphite furnace technique. Total Cd concentration in the control feed was 37.1 micrograms/kg wet weight (w.wt). The highest Cd levels were found in nonlocally produced feed components: vitamin-mineral mixture, lime, dicalcium phosphate, soybean meal, and rapeseed meal. These components contributed 70% of the Cd content in the feed. The main component, barley, which was locally produced, contributed 30% of the total Cd content in feed. The feed with reduced nitrogen content contained less soybean and rapeseed meal and a lower Cd level than the control feed. The Cd levels in kidney cortex varied from 38.0 to 105 micrograms/kg w.wt, with a mean level of 70.9 micrograms/kg. The levels differed between breeds and feeds, but not between gender. There was a significant correlation between Cd level in kidney cortex and age at slaughter, with an increase of 2.8 micrograms/kg w.wt in the kidney for each additional week of survival.

It is known that plasma pipecolic acid levels are elevated in patients with Zellweger syndrome, a genetic disorder, and chronic liver diseases. However, it is uncertain if this acid originates directly from food intake or from mammalian or intestinal bacterial enzyme metabolism. To characterize the relationship between plasma pipecolic acid and diet, we analyzed the contents of pipecolic acid in 17 edible plants and changes in plasma and urinary pipecolic acid levels following soybean juice ingestion by 4 healthy volunteers. Our study revealed that some of the plants contained high concentrations of total pipecolic acid, and a higher portion of L-isomer than D-isomer. Loading tests demonstrated that plasma levels and urinary excretion of D-isomer increased significantly 2 h after soybean juice ingestion. Plasma lysine levels showed a similar increase to that of D-isomer. These findings suggest that plasma pipecolic acid, particularly the D-isomer, originates mainly from the catabolism of dietary lysine by intestinal bacteria rather than by direct food intake and that D- and L-isomer may have different mechanisms of metabolism.

Data on mothers' milk FA and dietary habits which allowed food selection were recently published (Rocquelin et al., 1998). Most foods were locally produced. Food samples were collected at local markets, bleached if necessary to avoid microbial degradation, and stored at +4 degrees C or -20 degrees C. They were lyophilized upon their arrival in the laboratory before lipid analyses. FA composition of food lipids was determined by capillary gas chromatography. Staple diets included low-fat, high-carbohydrate foods (processed cassava roots, wheat bread) and high-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) foods: soybean oil (high in 18 : 2 n-6 and alpha-18 : 3 n-3), bushbutter (dacryodes edulis), peanuts, avocado (high in fat and 18 : 2 n-6), freshwater and salt-water fish (high in LC n-3 and/or n-6 PUFA), and leafy green vegetables (low in fat but very high in alpha-18 : 3 n-3).

All studies were conducted in young, healthy humans. Urinary isoflavonoids were measured by isotope-dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Similar to results from other studies, 35% of screened subjects (30 men and 30 women) excreted equol (>2000 nmol/d). In women, equol excretion was associated with higher intake of dietary fiber and carbohydrate. Fermentation of soy decreased the isoflavone content of the product fed but increased the urinary isoflavonoid recovery, suggesting that fermentation increases availability of isoflavones in soy. When soy-protein powder was fed at 0, 5, 10, and 20 g/d (0-36 mg isoflavones), there was a linear dose response of urinary isoflavonoid excretion to soy consumption that did not differ between subjects with high and low equol excretion. These results suggest that equol excretion may be related to the fermentable carbohydrate content of the diet; additional study is needed.

9651047,"Components with DNA breaking activity in soy sauce were investigated. It was found that there were water soluble high molecular weight DNA breaking components in soy sauce. Two DNA breaking components in the ethyl acetate extract of soy sauce were identified as fragrant components, 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone (DMHF) and 4-hydroxy-2(or 5)-ethyl-5(or 2)-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (HEMF), in addition to the previously characterized DNA breaking fragrant component 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (HMF) (Hiramoto et al., 1996b). Characterization of DNA breaking activity of HEMF was performed, and the mechanisms for the breaking were considered. HEMF cleaved the single strands of supercoiled pBR 322 DNA at pH 7.4 dose dependently and time dependently. DNA breaking was inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, hydroxyl radical scavengers, spin trapping agents and metal chelators, and enhanced by Fe(III) ion. Electron spin resonance-spin trapping technique revealed the generation of hydroxyl radical. Hence, active oxygen species derived from interaction of HEMF with metal ions and oxygen participated in the cleavage.

9492344,"Equol is an isoflavonoid phytoestrogen produced from the soy isoflavone daidzein by gut microflora. Not all humans produce equol from daidzein, presumably due to differences in colonic bacterial populations among individuals. Previously, smaller studies reported that approximately 30% of participants excreted equol when consuming soy. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of equol excreters in a larger sample and to examine what dietary components might influence the tendency to be an equol excreter. Thirty men and thirty women consumed a soy protein beverage containing 22 mg genistein and 8 mg daidzein for 4 days as a supplement to their habitual diets. The mean daily nutrient content of their habitual intakes was determined from 4-day food records. On Day 4, participants provided a 24-hour urine collection. Urinary isoflavonoid (genistein, daidzein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) excretion was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Twenty-one of the 60 participants (35%) excreted equol (> 2000 nmol/day) after 3 days of consuming the soy supplement. Daily equol excretion ranged from 2,134-20,301 nmol/day in the excreters and 21-233 nmol/day in the nonexcreters. There was no difference in equol excreter prevalence between men (43%) and women (27%). Daily excretion of daidzein, genistein, and O-desmethylangolensin was similar between equol excreters and nonexcreters and between men and women. Among the women, equol excreters consumed a significantly higher percentage of energy as carbohydrate and greater amounts of plant protein and dietary fiber, both as soluble and insoluble fiber compared to nonexcreters. Such differences were not observed in the men, who overall had significantly higher fiber intakes than the women. These data suggest that, among women, dietary fiber or other components of a high-fiber diet may promote the growth and/or the activity of bacterial populations responsible for equol production in the colon.","Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

The environmental pollution from nuclear testing into the atmosphere has resulted in the radioactive contamination in agricultural products and has continued for a long time. The radioactive contamination of agricultural products occurs through air, water and soil which were contaminated by radioactive fallout. In this paper, for the purpose of analyzing the extent of the radioactive contamination levels in the agricultural products of Saitama Prefecture, spinach, green soybeans, dried shiitake and welsh onion, were selected among products, as the amount of the harvest is abundant in all of Japan. Radioactivity concentration was investigated by gamma ray spectrometry and radiochemical analysis. The radioactivity concentrations of artificial radioactive nuclides, cesium-137 (137Cs) and strontium-90 (90Sr), were detected in the range which is considered to be the result of radioactive fallout. Moreover, in order to examine the effect on radioactivity concentrations in agricultural products by culinary processing, the raw agricultural products were boiled, and their radioactivity concentrations were compared with the raw produce.

9000275,"Two experiments were conducted to investigate the usefulness of a natural golden marine algae (MA) as a poultry ration supplement for the production of shell eggs rich in n-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA). This MA is unique due to a high concentration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n-3) and the absence of other n-3 FA normally present in marine oils such as menhaden oil (MO). In the first experiment, 60 24-wk-old Single Comb White Leghorn (SCWL) hens were divided among four dietary treatments, including a typical corn-soybean control (CON); 1.5% MO, supplying 233 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 155 mg DHA per d; 2.4% MA, supplying 200 mg DHA/d; and 4.8% MA, supplying 400 mg DHA/d. A second experiment using 96 56-wk-old SCWL was conducted using the same diets. In both experiments, eggs were collected weekly for 4 wk for determination of egg production parameters and yolk FA content. Each week, yolk samples were extracted, methyl estered, and quantified using gas chromatography. Transient depression in egg and yolk weights were noted early in Experiment 1 in response to dietary 4.8% MA. Although egg and yolk weights were not affected in Experiment 2, egg production was significantly reduced in the 4.8% MA treatment. Egg production was unaffected due to diet or week in Experiment 1. In both experiments, yolk polyunsaturated profiles were significantly influenced by diet. Dietary n-3 FA supplementation significantly increased yolk total N-3 FA with concomitant reductions in yolk n-6 FA. Although hens fed MO were supplied predominantly EPA, the principal yolk FA deposited was DHA. Marine algae also promoted efficient yolk DHA deposition with the highest yolk DHA concentrations attained in eggs from hens fed 4.8% MA.

8655094,"It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 mg/person, respectively.

8886128,"The isoflavonoids in soy, genistein and daidzein, have been proposed to contribute an important part of the anti-cancer effect of soy. Although there have been many interesting studies on the effects of isoflavones on biochemical targets in tissue culture experiments, in most cases the concentrations used by investigators have exceeded 10 microM. However, based on simple pharmacokinetic calculations involving daily intake of isoflavones, absorption from the gut, distribution to peripheral tissues, and excretion, it is unlikely that blood isoflavone concentrations even in high soy consumers could be greater than 1-5 microM. Experiments designed to evaluate these pharmacological principles were carried out in anesthetized rats with indwelling biliary catheters and in human volunteers consuming soy beverages. The data from these experiments indicate that genistein is efficiently absorbed from the gut, taken up by the liver and excreted in the bile as its 7-O-beta-glucuronide. Re-infused genistein 7-O-beta-glucuronide was also well absorbed from the gut, although this occurred in the distal small intestine. In human subjects fed a soy beverage for a period of two weeks, plasma levels of genistein and daidzein, determined by HPLC-mass spectrometry, ranged from 0.55-0.86 microM, mostly as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In summary, genistein is well absorbed from the small intestine and undergoes an enterohepatic circulation. Although the plasma genistein levels achievable with soy food feeding are unlikely to be sufficient to inhibit the growth of mature, established breast cancer cells by chemotherapeutic-like mechanisms, these levels are sufficient to regulate the proliferation of epithelial cells in the breast and thereby may cause a chemopreventive effect.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"['D000818', 'D000972', 'D001646', 'D004341', 'D004354', 'D004791', 'D005260', 'D019833', 'D006801', 'D007408', 'D007529', 'D008297', 'D015394', 'D008517', 'D011505', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D013025']","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Bile', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Isoflavones', 'Male', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phytotherapy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Soybeans']",Soy isoflavonoids and cancer prevention.

The mutagenicity of nitrite-treated tyramine, which is a major precursor of a mutagen in soy sauce treated with nitrite, was strongly reduced in the presence of ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol and more strongly reduced in the presence of methanol, but was increased twofold in the presence of the sugars glucose or sucrose. The reduction of the mutagenicity of nitrite-treated tyramine required simultaneous treatment of tyramine with ethanol and nitrite. The mutagenicity of tyramine treated with nitrite was clearly reduced in the presence of shochu and whiskey, similarly to ethanol.

Barrows were treated daily with buffer or porcine somatotropin (100 micrograms/kg body wt) when they weighed between 30 and 64 kg (eight pigs/group). Pigs were restrictively fed so that the average food intake was 1.86 kg/d. The corn-soybean meal-skim milk-based diet contained 18% crude protein and 1.2% lysine, and was designed to meet muscle amino acid ratio profile with respect to lysine as the first limiting amino acid for growth. Tissue levels of eighteen amino acids were determined on lyophilized samples that were appropriately hydrolyzed and analyzed by HPLC. The concentrations (mg/g dry wt) of all amino acids were greater in carcass, skin, head and empty body of porcine somatotropin-treated pigs; amino acid concentration in viscera was not influenced by porcine somatotropin. However, when the concentration of each amino acid was expressed on a per unit protein basis, the amino acid profiles of control and porcine somatotropin-treated pigs were quite similar. The average deposition rate of each amino acid was increased approximately 67% by porcine somatotropin. When the deposition of each amino acid was calculated in relation to lysine, however, the pattern of amino acid utilization for growth was similar for control and porcine somatotropin-treated pigs; exceptions were arginine, glycine and tryptophan. The ratio of indispensable to dispensable amino acids that were deposited was also similar for control and porcine somatotropin-treated pigs.

7891207,"Antioxidant biofactor: AOB is a unique processed grain food. It is a yellow-green powder. It contains the following extracts: germ extracts, soybean, rice bran, tear grass, sesame, wheat, citron, green tea, green leaf extract, and malted rice. These materials were slowly roasted under a powdered oure at less than 60 degrees C and fermented with Aspergillus oryzae over 3 days to transform each ingredient into low molecular weight substances. These conditions were different by each material, environmental humidity and temperature. It probably contains a variety of substances having antioxidant activity including flavonoids, alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, and tannins. We investigated its antioxidative properties using electron spin resonance (ESR) and autoxidation of rat brain homogenates. The superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and the stable free radical, diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of AOB was investigated using ESR spectrometry. In an in vitro study, a suspension of AOB was added directly to a superoxide generating system (hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase; HX/XO) and investigated using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trapping agent. At final concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/ml, AOB dose-dependent scavenging activity was observed as 0.103, 0.619, and 1.369 U/ml, respectively. A concentration of 1.0 mg/ml completely scavenged DMPO-OOH signals; 1.0 mg/ml of AOB inhibited the DMPO-OH signal generated by Fenton's reaction, but its inhibitory effect was not competitive, and was inhibition of the Fenton's reaction. 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/ml of AOB were significantly inhibited the DPPH radical. In an in vivo study, rats were fed AOB orally at doses of 1 or 5 g/day for 24 h or for 3 days and the superoxide scavenging activity was measured in plasma.

8171919,"The water sorption isotherms of wheat and soy flour were constructed at 30 degrees C using the computerized inverse gas chromatographic technique. Wheat flour showed a higher sorptive capacity than soy flour. This was attributed to the higher sorptive capacity of starch, the main constituent of wheat flour as compared to that of protein, the main constituent of soy flour. Subsequently the flour samples were heat-treated at 150 degrees C for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h in the dry state.

Nattokinase was extracted from natto with saline and isolated by sequential use of hydrophobic chromatography on Butyl-Toyopearl, ion-exchange chromatography on CM-Toyopearl, and gel-filtration on Sephadex G-50. The isolated protein gave a single sharp band on SDS-PAGE either before or after reduction. The sequence, as determined by automated Edman degradation of the uncleaved molecule and its enzymatically derived peptide, consisted of a total 275 amino acid residues (M.W = 27,728) and exhibited a high homology with the subtilisins. The purified nattokinase digested not only fibrin but also several synthetic substrates. Among the synthetic substrates, the most sensitive substrate was Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA for subtilisin.

The secondary structures of these three proteins determined by far u.v. circular dichroism were characterized by predominantly beta-sheet and beta-turn parameters. However, characterization of tertiary and quaternary structures using second derivative u.v. absorption spectroscopy, surface hydrophobicity using cis-parinaric acid as hydrophobic probe, and fluorescence quenching studies of intrinsic Trp fluorescence using an ionic (iodide) and a neutral (acrylamide) quencher indicated sharp differences in the conformation of these proteins. About 9.6 and 10.2 out of 13 and 15 tyrosyls/subunit of phaseolin and beta-conglycinin, respectively, were exposed to polar solvent, while the surface hydrophobicity varied beta-conglycinin greater than vicilin greater than phaseolin. The Trp residues in phaseolin were not accessible to iodide, while half those of vicilin and beta-conglycinin were quenched. The order of Trp accessibility to acrylamide was vicilin greater than beta-conglycinin greater than phaseolin.

Each menu was designed to contain 35% fat calories with either 10 or 30 gm/day of linoleic acid (18:2) and 500 mg/day of cholesterol. To estimate vitamin E activity, each food used in the menus was analyzed for alpha and gamma tocopherol content by high-pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. This article reports the alpha and gamma tocopherol contents of those foods, tocopherol contributions from each food in one sample 2,400-kcal menu, and the mean daily vitamin E activity (milligram alpha tocopherol equivalents) of all seven menus at five caloric levels. Major sources of alpha tocopherol (greater than 10% of the RDA) common to both diets (10 and 30 gm linoleic acid) were olive oil and a few fruits and vegetables. Additional major sources in the 30-gm linoleic acid diets were polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) vegetable oils and margarine. Contrary to a common assumption, increasing the level of PUFA in the menus did not necessarily result in higher milligram equivalents of alpha tocopherol because soybean oil, with a tocopherol composition that is predominantly gamma tocopherol, was the major source of linoleic acid in the diets. Thus, vitamin E activity was not necessarily increased when soybean oil was substituted for a less saturated fat such as olive oil, which has mostly alpha tocopherol.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,"['D002851', 'D005231', 'D005504', 'D019787', 'D008041', 'D009751', 'D014810']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Food Analysis', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Linoleic Acids', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Vitamin E']",Vitamin E in foods from high and low linoleic acid diets.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3745745,1986

The influence of different concentration characteristics on the fumigation and the decomposition of phosphine residues was investigated in accordance with the fumigation technique. At the beginning the concentration increases, and after attaining the maximum gradually decreases to zero. The level of residues during the fumigation as well as the behaviour of residues during the storage of the fumigated products was monitored with a gas chromatographic method. The residues correlate with the concentration of phosphine, they also pass through a peak. The rate of decomposition of residues which had been formed in the phase of increasing concentration is greater than the rate of residues of equal magnitude which had been formed during the decreasing phase. When the concentration is even the maximum residue occurs later than the maximum concentration; when there is a steep trend both maximums coincide. This behaviour can be explained by the sorption and diffusion of phosphine. A comparison is made with the phosphine concentration which occurs during fumigation in practice. The parameters which produce a constant concentration trend with only one maximum and a non constant trend with an often increasing and decreasing concentration are discussed.

In the LC procedure, glycine and threonine were not resolved, and proline and cyst(e)ine were not detected. In general, amino acid values obtained by LC and IEC compared closely within and across feedstuffs, and both agreed well with published amino acid composition data.

Zygotes developed normally to ookinetes in the gut of plasma-fed mosquitoes, or when cultured in plasma or M199. Ookinetes from culture formed normal oocysts when fed to mosquitoes in blood or when injected with M199 into the hemocoels of unfed females.

6538902,"The amino acid composition of five protein samples (casein, beef, wheat flour, peanut flour and soy protein isolate) was obtained from several sources: various routine analytical procedures, manufacturer's fact sheets, and published data. The amino acid profile from each source was scored against three reference patterns, each based on an estimate of human essential amino acid requirements. Protein quality ratings based on chemical score were variable. Both the chemical score and predicted first-limiting amino acid for a given protein often differed with data source and choice of reference pattern. Some of the predictions contradicted those previously validated by bioassays. The variability in protein quality ratings was reduced somewhat by expressing the data as essential amino acid indices. But this also reduced the degree of difference in protein quality among the various proteins. Although the amino acid profile of food proteins provides an important perspective on their nutritive value, it appears that the imprecision and uncertain accuracy of routine hydrolysis and analytical procedures confound the use of amino acid data for regulating protein quality.

Cells of the unincubated as well as those of primitive streak chick blastoderm, which are preparing for or are involved in morphogenetic movements, are agglutinated by wheat germ agglutinin, Ricinus communis agglutinin and concanavalin A, but not by fucose-binding protein. 2. Agglutination of these cells with soybean agglutinin occurs only after neuraminidase treatment, while that induced by concanavalin A, wheat germ and Ricinus communis agglutinins is not affected. 3. Trypsin treatment of blastoderm cells had no effect on lectin-mediated agglutination. 4. In contrast, cells derived from 10-and 12-day differentiating chick liver were agglutinated by wheat germ agglutinin only after trypsinization. 5. Mechanically dissociated embryonic liver cells, which are not agglutinated, bind more 3H-labelled wheat germ agglutinin per cell than trypsinized cells, suggesting that during differentiation there may be a spatial reorganization of wheat germ agglutinin receptors within the plasma membrane. 6.

The pH optimum for the hydroperoxide isomerase enzyme from barley is 6.2; from wheat germ, 6.1; and from soybean, 6.1.The identification of the hydroperoxide isomerase enzyme clarifies the role of lipoxidase in plant tissue and suggests a participation of lipid in the electron transport system.",Plant physiology,[],[],Hydroperoxide isomerase: a new enzyme of lipid metabolism.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16657484,2010
27520953,"Soybeans of the Hawkeye variety were picked at eleven periods from 30 to 111 days after flowering and extracted with chloroform-methanol. The triglyceride fraction of five pickings, selected 35 to 91 days after flowering (when synthesis of lipid was most active), were isolated by silicic acid thin layer chromatography (TLC) and species composition determined using argentation TLC and lipase hydrolysis. The triglyceride content of the total lipid increased from 6.5% at 30 days after flowering to 85% in the mature bean (111 days). The major changes in fatty acid composition of the triglycerides occurred during the first 52 days after flowering. During this period linolenic acid decreased from 34.2% to 11.7%, the percentages of linoleic and oleic acids increased, stearic remained fairly constant and palmitic decreased slightly. Large quantitative changes occurred in the molecular species of the triglycerides of the bean during maturation; some triglycerides containing linolenic acid could not be detected approximately 66 days after flowering. Although changes occurred in the percentage and amount of each triglyceride species, the positional distribution of fatty acids remained virtually unchanged throughout maturation. Linolenic acid was distributed fairly uniformly between the β-position and the α-positions, linoleate favored esterification in the β-position, and oleate the α-positions. Most of the stearic and palmitic acids were esterified in the α-positions. The consistency of the positional arrangement of the fatty acids indicated that the mode of glyceride synthesis was established very early during maturation and molecular species composition was controlled by the fatty acids available for synthesis.
