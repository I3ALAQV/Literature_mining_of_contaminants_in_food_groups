30379877,"The goal of this study was to select a representative cucurbit vegetable crop that contained the highest residue levels of the pesticide azoxystrobinon. To do this, we used open field application of azoxystrobinon in four cucurbit crops (cucumber, zucchini, bitter gourd, and loofah) in Beijing, Shandong, and Anhui. Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with selected reaction monitoring was used to determine azoxystrobinon levels in each of the selected cucurbit vegetables. The azoxystrobinon limit of detection was 0.005 mg kg-1 for all samples. Recoveries of azoxystrobinon ranged from 94.2% to 107.1% at spiked levels of 0.005-0.5 mg kg-1. In field trials, the half-life of azoxystrobinon in each of the four cucurbit crops was within the range of 1.4-3.1 d. Based on these results, we recommend that bitter gourd is selected as a representative cucurbit vegetable for future studies of azoxystrobinon. The obtained residual data were also assessed for their dietary risk and results indicated that there is no chronic dietary risk in any of the four, selected cucurbit vegetables. The recommended maximum residue limit (MRL) of azoxystrobinon in this subgroup was 0.2 mg/kg.",PloS one,"['D002681', 'D002853', 'D018556', 'D028464', 'D005659', 'D006207', 'D057230', 'D029777', 'D011743', 'D000073739', 'D053719', 'D014675']","['China', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'Cucurbita', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Half-Life', 'Limit of Detection', 'Momordica charantia', 'Pyrimidines', 'Strobilurins', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Vegetables']",Bitter gourd has the highest azoxystrobinon residue after open field application on four cucurbit vegetables.,"[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","[None, 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30379877,2019
25819788,"Nanoporous carbon with a high specific surface area and unique porous structure represents an attractive material as an adsorbent in analytical chemistry. In this study, a magnetic nanoporous carbon (MNC) was fabricated by direct carbonization of Co-based metal-organic framework in nitrogen atmosphere without using any additional carbon precursors. The MNC was used as an effective magnetic adsorbent for the extraction and enrichment of some phenylurea herbicides (monuron, isoproturon, diuron and buturon) in grape and bitter gourd samples prior to their determination by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Several important experimental parameters that could influence the extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, a good linearity was achieved in the concentration range of 1.0-100.0 ng g(-1) for monuron, diuron and buturon and 1.5-100.0 ng g(-1) for isoproturon with the correlation coefficients (r) larger than 0.9964. The limits of detection (S/N=3) of the method were in the range from 0.17 to 0.46 ng g(-1).

25639652,"A buffered ethyl acetate extraction method is proposed for the simultaneous analysis of 296 agrochemicals in a wide range of fruit and vegetable matrices by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The optimized quantity of acetate buffer (1% acetic acid + 0.5 g of sodium acetate per 10 g of sample) adjusted the pH of each test matrix to 5-6, which in turn significantly improved recoveries of acidic and basic compounds. The role of diethylene glycol (used in the evaporation step) on signal suppression of certain compounds was evaluated, and its quantity was optimized to minimize such an effect. The method was validated in grape, mango, drumstick, bitter gourd, capsicum, curry leaf, and okra as per the DG-SANCO/12571/2013 guidelines. Recoveries in the fortification range of 1-40 μg/kg were within 70-120% with associated relative standard deviations below 20% for most of the compounds.

The concentrations of six pesticides were determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass selective detector (GC-MSD) in locally produced vegetables purchased from wholesale markets. A total of 200 samples of eight vegetables viz. cauliflower, green chilli, eggplant, tomato, peas, bitter gourd, spinach and apple gourd were analyzed for pesticide residues. The results indicated that almost all samples were contained pesticides, only 39% contained pesticide residues at or below maximum residue limits (MRLs), and 61% contained pesticide residues above MRLs. From the six analyzed pesticides, carbofuran and chlorpyrifos were found above to MRLs with concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.39 and 0.05-0.96 mg/kg, respectively.

19366669,"Although geneticists and archaeologists continue to make progress world-wide in documenting the time and place of the initial domestication of a growing number of plants and animals, far less is known regarding the critically important context of coalescence of various species into distinctive sets or complexes of domesticates in each of the world's 10 or more independent centers of agricultural origin. In this article, the initial emergence of a crop complex is described for one of the best-documented of these independent centers, eastern North America (ENA). Before 4000 B.P. there is no indication of a crop complex in ENA, only isolated evidence for single indigenous domesticate species. By 3800 B.P., however, at least 5 domesticated seed-bearing plants formed a coherent complex in the river valley corridors of ENA. Accelerator mass spectrometer radiocarbon dates and reanalysis of archaeobotanical assemblages from a short occupation of the Riverton Site in Illinois documents the contemporary cultivation at 3800 B.P. of domesticated bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa), sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macrocarpus), and 2 cultivated varieties of chenopod (Chenopodium berlandieri), as well as the possible cultivation of Cucurbita pepo squash and little barley (Hordeum pusillum). Rather than marking either an abrupt developmental break or a necessary response to population-packing or compressed resource catchments, the coalescence of an initial crop complex in ENA appears to reflect an integrated expansion and enhancement of preexisting hunting and gathering economies that took place within a context of stable long-term adaptation to resource-rich river valley settings.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"['D001106', 'D027462', 'D018556', 'D005843', 'D049690', 'D013058', 'D009656', 'D055110', 'D013997']","['Archaeology', 'Chenopodium', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'Geography', 'History, Ancient', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'North America', 'Radiometric Dating', 'Time Factors']",Initial formation of an indigenous crop complex in eastern North America at 3800 B.P.,"[None, 'Q000254', 'Q000266', None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'growth & development', 'history', None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19366669,2009

However, the implications of contamination of agricultural soils from long-term irrigation with As-contaminated groundwater for phyto-accumulation in food crops, and thence dietary exposure to As, and other metals, has not been assessed previously in Bangladesh. Various vegetables were sampled in Samta village in the Jessore district of Bangladesh, and screened for As, Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). These local food products are the basis of human nutrition in this region and of great relevance to human health. The results revealed that the individual vegetables containing the highest mean As concentrations microg x g(-1)) are snake gourd (0.489), ghotkol (0.446), taro (0.440), green papaya (0.389), elephant foot (0.338) and Bottle ground leaf (0.306), respectively. The As concentration in fleshy vegetable material is low. In general, the data show the potential for some vegetables to accumulate heavy metals with concentrations of Pb greater than Cd. Some vegetables such as bottle ground leaf, ghotkol, taro, eddoe and elephant foot had much higher concentrations of Pb. Other leafy and root vegetables, contained higher concentrations of Zn and Cu. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) values, based on dry weight, were below 1 for all metals. In most cases, BCF values decreased with increasing metal concentrations in the soil.
